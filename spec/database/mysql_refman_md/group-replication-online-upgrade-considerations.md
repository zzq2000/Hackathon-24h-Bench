#### 20.8.3.1 Online Upgrade Considerations

When upgrading an online group you should consider the following
points:

- Regardless of the way which you upgrade your group, it is
  important to disable any writes to group members until they
  are ready to rejoin the group.
- When a member is stopped, the
  [`super_read_only`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_super_read_only) variable is
  set to on automatically, but this change is not persisted.
- When MySQL 5.7.22 or MySQL 8.0.11 tries to join a group
  running MySQL 5.7.21 or lower it fails to join the group
  because MySQL 5.7.21 does not send its value of
  [`lower_case_table_names`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_lower_case_table_names).
