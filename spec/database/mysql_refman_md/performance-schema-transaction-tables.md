### 29.12.7 Performance Schema Transaction Tables

[29.12.7.1 The events\_transactions\_current Table](performance-schema-events-transactions-current-table.md)

[29.12.7.2 The events\_transactions\_history Table](performance-schema-events-transactions-history-table.md)

[29.12.7.3 The events\_transactions\_history\_long Table](performance-schema-events-transactions-history-long-table.md)

The Performance Schema instruments transactions. Within the
event hierarchy, wait events nest within stage events, which
nest within statement events, which nest within transaction
events.

These tables store transaction events:

- [`events_transactions_current`](performance-schema-events-transactions-current-table.md "29.12.7.1 The events_transactions_current Table"):
  The current transaction event for each thread.
- [`events_transactions_history`](performance-schema-events-transactions-history-table.md "29.12.7.2 The events_transactions_history Table"):
  The most recent transaction events that have ended per
  thread.
- [`events_transactions_history_long`](performance-schema-events-transactions-history-long-table.md "29.12.7.3 The events_transactions_history_long Table"):
  The most recent transaction events that have ended globally
  (across all threads).

The following sections describe the transaction event tables.
There are also summary tables that aggregate information about
transaction events; see
[Section 29.12.20.5, “Transaction Summary Tables”](performance-schema-transaction-summary-tables.md "29.12.20.5 Transaction Summary Tables").

For more information about the relationship between the three
transaction event tables, see
[Section 29.9, “Performance Schema Tables for Current and Historical Events”](performance-schema-event-tables.md "29.9 Performance Schema Tables for Current and Historical Events").

#### Configuring Transaction Event Collection

To control whether to collect transaction events, set the state
of the relevant instruments and consumers:

- The [`setup_instruments`](performance-schema-setup-instruments-table.md "29.12.2.3 The setup_instruments Table") table
  contains an instrument named `transaction`.
  Use this instrument to enable or disable collection of
  individual transaction event classes.
- The [`setup_consumers`](performance-schema-setup-consumers-table.md "29.12.2.2 The setup_consumers Table") table
  contains consumer values with names corresponding to the
  current and historical transaction event table names. Use
  these consumers to filter collection of transaction events.

The `transaction` instrument and the
`events_transactions_current` and
`events_transactions_history` transaction
consumers are enabled by default:

```sql
mysql> SELECT NAME, ENABLED, TIMED
       FROM performance_schema.setup_instruments
       WHERE NAME = 'transaction';
+-------------+---------+-------+
| NAME        | ENABLED | TIMED |
+-------------+---------+-------+
| transaction | YES     | YES   |
+-------------+---------+-------+
mysql> SELECT *
       FROM performance_schema.setup_consumers
       WHERE NAME LIKE 'events_transactions%';
+----------------------------------+---------+
| NAME                             | ENABLED |
+----------------------------------+---------+
| events_transactions_current      | YES     |
| events_transactions_history      | YES     |
| events_transactions_history_long | NO      |
+----------------------------------+---------+
```

To control transaction event collection at server startup, use
lines like these in your `my.cnf` file:

- Enable:

  ```ini
  [mysqld]
  performance-schema-instrument='transaction=ON'
  performance-schema-consumer-events-transactions-current=ON
  performance-schema-consumer-events-transactions-history=ON
  performance-schema-consumer-events-transactions-history-long=ON
  ```
- Disable:

  ```ini
  [mysqld]
  performance-schema-instrument='transaction=OFF'
  performance-schema-consumer-events-transactions-current=OFF
  performance-schema-consumer-events-transactions-history=OFF
  performance-schema-consumer-events-transactions-history-long=OFF
  ```

To control transaction event collection at runtime, update the
[`setup_instruments`](performance-schema-setup-instruments-table.md "29.12.2.3 The setup_instruments Table") and
[`setup_consumers`](performance-schema-setup-consumers-table.md "29.12.2.2 The setup_consumers Table") tables:

- Enable:

  ```sql
  UPDATE performance_schema.setup_instruments
  SET ENABLED = 'YES', TIMED = 'YES'
  WHERE NAME = 'transaction';

  UPDATE performance_schema.setup_consumers
  SET ENABLED = 'YES'
  WHERE NAME LIKE 'events_transactions%';
  ```
- Disable:

  ```sql
  UPDATE performance_schema.setup_instruments
  SET ENABLED = 'NO', TIMED = 'NO'
  WHERE NAME = 'transaction';

  UPDATE performance_schema.setup_consumers
  SET ENABLED = 'NO'
  WHERE NAME LIKE 'events_transactions%';
  ```

To collect transaction events only for specific transaction
event tables, enable the `transaction`
instrument but only the transaction consumers corresponding to
the desired tables.

For additional information about configuring event collection,
see [Section 29.3, “Performance Schema Startup Configuration”](performance-schema-startup-configuration.md "29.3 Performance Schema Startup Configuration"),
and [Section 29.4, “Performance Schema Runtime Configuration”](performance-schema-runtime-configuration.md "29.4 Performance Schema Runtime Configuration").

#### Transaction Boundaries

In MySQL Server, transactions start explicitly with these
statements:

```sql
START TRANSACTION | BEGIN | XA START | XA BEGIN
```

Transactions also start implicitly. For example, when the
[`autocommit`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_autocommit) system variable is
enabled, the start of each statement starts a new transaction.

When [`autocommit`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_autocommit) is disabled,
the first statement following a committed transaction marks the
start of a new transaction. Subsequent statements are part of
the transaction until it is committed.

Transactions explicitly end with these statements:

```sql
COMMIT | ROLLBACK | XA COMMIT | XA ROLLBACK
```

Transactions also end implicitly, by execution of DDL
statements, locking statements, and server administration
statements.

In the following discussion, references to
[`START
TRANSACTION`](commit.md "15.3.1 START TRANSACTION, COMMIT, and ROLLBACK Statements") also apply to
[`BEGIN`](commit.md "15.3.1 START TRANSACTION, COMMIT, and ROLLBACK Statements"),
[`XA
START`](xa-statements.md "15.3.8.1 XA Transaction SQL Statements"), and
[`XA
BEGIN`](xa-statements.md "15.3.8.1 XA Transaction SQL Statements"). Similarly, references to
[`COMMIT`](commit.md "15.3.1 START TRANSACTION, COMMIT, and ROLLBACK Statements") and
[`ROLLBACK`](commit.md "15.3.1 START TRANSACTION, COMMIT, and ROLLBACK Statements") apply
to [`XA
COMMIT`](xa-statements.md "15.3.8.1 XA Transaction SQL Statements") and
[`XA
ROLLBACK`](xa-statements.md "15.3.8.1 XA Transaction SQL Statements"), respectively.

The Performance Schema defines transaction boundaries similarly
to that of the server. The start and end of a transaction event
closely match the corresponding state transitions in the server:

- For an explicitly started transaction, the transaction event
  starts during processing of the
  [`START
  TRANSACTION`](commit.md "15.3.1 START TRANSACTION, COMMIT, and ROLLBACK Statements") statement.
- For an implicitly started transaction, the transaction event
  starts on the first statement that uses a transactional
  engine after the previous transaction has ended.
- For any transaction, whether explicitly or implicitly ended,
  the transaction event ends when the server transitions out
  of the active transaction state during the processing of
  [`COMMIT`](commit.md "15.3.1 START TRANSACTION, COMMIT, and ROLLBACK Statements") or
  [`ROLLBACK`](commit.md "15.3.1 START TRANSACTION, COMMIT, and ROLLBACK Statements").

There are subtle implications to this approach:

- Transaction events in the Performance Schema do not fully
  include the statement events associated with the
  corresponding [`START
  TRANSACTION`](commit.md "15.3.1 START TRANSACTION, COMMIT, and ROLLBACK Statements"),
  [`COMMIT`](commit.md "15.3.1 START TRANSACTION, COMMIT, and ROLLBACK Statements"), or
  [`ROLLBACK`](commit.md "15.3.1 START TRANSACTION, COMMIT, and ROLLBACK Statements")
  statements. There is a trivial amount of timing overlap
  between the transaction event and these statements.
- Statements that work with nontransactional engines have no
  effect on the transaction state of the connection. For
  implicit transactions, the transaction event begins with the
  first statement that uses a transactional engine. This means
  that statements operating exclusively on nontransactional
  tables are ignored, even following
  [`START
  TRANSACTION`](commit.md "15.3.1 START TRANSACTION, COMMIT, and ROLLBACK Statements").

To illustrate, consider the following scenario:

```none
1. SET autocommit = OFF;
2. CREATE TABLE t1 (a INT) ENGINE = InnoDB;
3. START TRANSACTION;                       -- Transaction 1 START
4. INSERT INTO t1 VALUES (1), (2), (3);
5. CREATE TABLE t2 (a INT) ENGINE = MyISAM; -- Transaction 1 COMMIT
                                            -- (implicit; DDL forces commit)
6. INSERT INTO t2 VALUES (1), (2), (3);     -- Update nontransactional table
7. UPDATE t2 SET a = a + 1;                 -- ... and again
8. INSERT INTO t1 VALUES (4), (5), (6);     -- Write to transactional table
                                            -- Transaction 2 START (implicit)
9. COMMIT;                                  -- Transaction 2 COMMIT
```

From the perspective of the server, Transaction 1 ends when
table `t2` is created. Transaction 2 does not
start until a transactional table is accessed, despite the
intervening updates to nontransactional tables.

From the perspective of the Performance Schema, Transaction 2
starts when the server transitions into an active transaction
state. Statements 6 and 7 are not included within the boundaries
of Transaction 2, which is consistent with how the server writes
transactions to the binary log.

#### Transaction Instrumentation

Three attributes define transactions:

- Access mode (read only, read write)
- Isolation level
  ([`SERIALIZABLE`](innodb-transaction-isolation-levels.md#isolevel_serializable),
  [`REPEATABLE READ`](innodb-transaction-isolation-levels.md#isolevel_repeatable-read), and so
  forth)
- Implicit ([`autocommit`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_autocommit)
  enabled) or explicit
  ([`autocommit`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_autocommit) disabled)

To reduce complexity of the transaction instrumentation and to
ensure that the collected transaction data provides complete,
meaningful results, all transactions are instrumented
independently of access mode, isolation level, or autocommit
mode.

To selectively examine transaction history, use the attribute
columns in the transaction event tables:
`ACCESS_MODE`,
`ISOLATION_LEVEL`, and
`AUTOCOMMIT`.

The cost of transaction instrumentation can be reduced various
ways, such as enabling or disabling transaction instrumentation
according to user, account, host, or thread (client connection).

#### Transactions and Nested Events

The parent of a transaction event is the event that initiated
the transaction. For an explicitly started transaction, this
includes the [`START
TRANSACTION`](commit.md "15.3.1 START TRANSACTION, COMMIT, and ROLLBACK Statements") and
[`COMMIT AND
CHAIN`](commit.md "15.3.1 START TRANSACTION, COMMIT, and ROLLBACK Statements") statements. For an implicitly started
transaction, it is the first statement that uses a transactional
engine after the previous transaction ends.

In general, a transaction is the top-level parent to all events
initiated during the transaction, including statements that
explicitly end the transaction such as
[`COMMIT`](commit.md "15.3.1 START TRANSACTION, COMMIT, and ROLLBACK Statements") and
[`ROLLBACK`](commit.md "15.3.1 START TRANSACTION, COMMIT, and ROLLBACK Statements").
Exceptions are statements that implicitly end a transaction,
such as DDL statements, in which case the current transaction
must be committed before the new statement is executed.

#### Transactions and Stored Programs

Transactions and stored program events are related as follows:

- Stored Procedures

  Stored procedures operate independently of transactions. A
  stored procedure can be started within a transaction, and a
  transaction can be started or ended from within a stored
  procedure. If called from within a transaction, a stored
  procedure can execute statements that force a commit of the
  parent transaction and then start a new transaction.

  If a stored procedure is started within a transaction, that
  transaction is the parent of the stored procedure event.

  If a transaction is started by a stored procedure, the
  stored procedure is the parent of the transaction event.
- Stored Functions

  Stored functions are restricted from causing an explicit or
  implicit commit or rollback. Stored function events can
  reside within a parent transaction event.
- Triggers

  Triggers activate as part of a statement that accesses the
  table with which it is associated, so the parent of a
  trigger event is always the statement that activates it.

  Triggers cannot issue statements that cause an explicit or
  implicit commit or rollback of a transaction.
- Scheduled Events

  The execution of the statements in the body of a scheduled
  event takes place in a new connection. Nesting of a
  scheduled event within a parent transaction is not
  applicable.

#### Transactions and Savepoints

Savepoint statements are recorded as separate statement events.
Transaction events include separate counters for
[`SAVEPOINT`](savepoint.md "15.3.4 SAVEPOINT, ROLLBACK TO SAVEPOINT, and RELEASE SAVEPOINT Statements"),
[`ROLLBACK TO
SAVEPOINT`](savepoint.md "15.3.4 SAVEPOINT, ROLLBACK TO SAVEPOINT, and RELEASE SAVEPOINT Statements"), and
[`RELEASE
SAVEPOINT`](savepoint.md "15.3.4 SAVEPOINT, ROLLBACK TO SAVEPOINT, and RELEASE SAVEPOINT Statements") statements issued during the transaction.

#### Transactions and Errors

Errors and warnings that occur within a transaction are recorded
in statement events, but not in the corresponding transaction
event. This includes transaction-specific errors and warnings,
such as a rollback on a nontransactional table or GTID
consistency errors.
