The storage requirements for table data on disk depend on several
factors. Different storage engines represent data types and store
raw data differently. Table data might be compressed, either for a
column or an entire row, complicating the calculation of storage
requirements for a table or column.

Despite differences in storage layout on disk, the internal MySQL
APIs that communicate and exchange information about table rows
use a consistent data structure that applies across all storage
engines.

This section includes guidelines and information for the storage
requirements for each data type supported by MySQL, including the
internal format and size for storage engines that use a fixed-size
representation for data types. Information is listed by category
or storage engine.

The internal representation of a table has a maximum row size of
65,535 bytes, even if the storage engine is capable of supporting
larger rows. This figure excludes
[`BLOB`](blob.md "13.3.4 The BLOB and TEXT Types") or
[`TEXT`](blob.md "13.3.4 The BLOB and TEXT Types") columns, which contribute only
9 to 12 bytes toward this size. For
[`BLOB`](blob.md "13.3.4 The BLOB and TEXT Types") and
[`TEXT`](blob.md "13.3.4 The BLOB and TEXT Types") data, the information is
stored internally in a different area of memory than the row
buffer. Different storage engines handle the allocation and
storage of this data in different ways, according to the method
they use for handling the corresponding types. For more
information, see [Chapter 18, *Alternative Storage Engines*](storage-engines.md "Chapter 18 Alternative Storage Engines"), and
[Section 10.4.7, “Limits on Table Column Count and Row Size”](column-count-limit.md "10.4.7 Limits on Table Column Count and Row Size").

### InnoDB Table Storage Requirements

See [Section 17.10, “InnoDB Row Formats”](innodb-row-format.md "17.10 InnoDB Row Formats") for information about
storage requirements for `InnoDB` tables.

### NDB Table Storage Requirements

Important

[`NDB`](mysql-cluster.md "Chapter 25 MySQL NDB Cluster 8.0") tables use
4-byte alignment; all
[`NDB`](mysql-cluster.md "Chapter 25 MySQL NDB Cluster 8.0") data storage is done in
multiples of 4 bytes. Thus, a column value that would
typically take 15 bytes requires 16 bytes in an
[`NDB`](mysql-cluster.md "Chapter 25 MySQL NDB Cluster 8.0") table. For example, in
[`NDB`](mysql-cluster.md "Chapter 25 MySQL NDB Cluster 8.0") tables, the
[`TINYINT`](integer-types.md "13.1.2 Integer Types (Exact Value) - INTEGER, INT, SMALLINT, TINYINT, MEDIUMINT, BIGINT"),
[`SMALLINT`](integer-types.md "13.1.2 Integer Types (Exact Value) - INTEGER, INT, SMALLINT, TINYINT, MEDIUMINT, BIGINT"),
[`MEDIUMINT`](integer-types.md "13.1.2 Integer Types (Exact Value) - INTEGER, INT, SMALLINT, TINYINT, MEDIUMINT, BIGINT"), and
[`INTEGER`](integer-types.md "13.1.2 Integer Types (Exact Value) - INTEGER, INT, SMALLINT, TINYINT, MEDIUMINT, BIGINT")
([`INT`](integer-types.md "13.1.2 Integer Types (Exact Value) - INTEGER, INT, SMALLINT, TINYINT, MEDIUMINT, BIGINT")) column types each require
4 bytes storage per record due to the alignment factor.

Each `BIT(M)`
column takes *`M`* bits of storage
space. Although an individual
[`BIT`](bit-type.md "13.1.5 Bit-Value Type - BIT") column is
*not* 4-byte aligned,
[`NDB`](mysql-cluster.md "Chapter 25 MySQL NDB Cluster 8.0") reserves 4 bytes (32 bits)
per row for the first 1-32 bits needed for
`BIT` columns, then another 4 bytes for bits
33-64, and so on.

While a `NULL` itself does not require any
storage space, [`NDB`](mysql-cluster.md "Chapter 25 MySQL NDB Cluster 8.0") reserves 4
bytes per row if the table definition contains any columns
allowing `NULL`, up to 32
`NULL` columns. (If an NDB Cluster table is
defined with more than 32 `NULL` columns up
to 64 `NULL` columns, then 8 bytes per row
are reserved.)

Every table using the [`NDB`](mysql-cluster.md "Chapter 25 MySQL NDB Cluster 8.0") storage
engine requires a primary key; if you do not define a primary
key, a “hidden” primary key is created by
[`NDB`](mysql-cluster.md "Chapter 25 MySQL NDB Cluster 8.0"). This hidden primary key
consumes 31-35 bytes per table record.

You can use the [**ndb\_size.pl**](mysql-cluster-programs-ndb-size-pl.md "25.5.28 ndb_size.pl — NDBCLUSTER Size Requirement Estimator") Perl script to
estimate [`NDB`](mysql-cluster.md "Chapter 25 MySQL NDB Cluster 8.0") storage requirements.
It connects to a current MySQL (not NDB Cluster) database and
creates a report on how much space that database would require
if it used the [`NDB`](mysql-cluster.md "Chapter 25 MySQL NDB Cluster 8.0") storage engine.
See [Section 25.5.28, “ndb\_size.pl — NDBCLUSTER Size Requirement Estimator”](mysql-cluster-programs-ndb-size-pl.md "25.5.28 ndb_size.pl — NDBCLUSTER Size Requirement Estimator") for
more information.

### Numeric Type Storage Requirements

| Data Type | Storage Required |
| --- | --- |
| [`TINYINT`](integer-types.md "13.1.2 Integer Types (Exact Value) - INTEGER, INT, SMALLINT, TINYINT, MEDIUMINT, BIGINT") | 1 byte |
| [`SMALLINT`](integer-types.md "13.1.2 Integer Types (Exact Value) - INTEGER, INT, SMALLINT, TINYINT, MEDIUMINT, BIGINT") | 2 bytes |
| [`MEDIUMINT`](integer-types.md "13.1.2 Integer Types (Exact Value) - INTEGER, INT, SMALLINT, TINYINT, MEDIUMINT, BIGINT") | 3 bytes |
| [`INT`](integer-types.md "13.1.2 Integer Types (Exact Value) - INTEGER, INT, SMALLINT, TINYINT, MEDIUMINT, BIGINT"), [`INTEGER`](integer-types.md "13.1.2 Integer Types (Exact Value) - INTEGER, INT, SMALLINT, TINYINT, MEDIUMINT, BIGINT") | 4 bytes |
| [`BIGINT`](integer-types.md "13.1.2 Integer Types (Exact Value) - INTEGER, INT, SMALLINT, TINYINT, MEDIUMINT, BIGINT") | 8 bytes |
| `FLOAT(p)` | 4 bytes if 0 <= *`p`* <= 24, 8 bytes if 25 <= *`p`* <= 53 |
| [`FLOAT`](floating-point-types.md "13.1.4 Floating-Point Types (Approximate Value) - FLOAT, DOUBLE") | 4 bytes |
| `DOUBLE [PRECISION]`, [`REAL`](floating-point-types.md "13.1.4 Floating-Point Types (Approximate Value) - FLOAT, DOUBLE") | 8 bytes |
| `DECIMAL(M,D)`, `NUMERIC(M,D)` | Varies; see following discussion |
| `BIT(M)` | approximately (*`M`*+7)/8 bytes |

Values for [`DECIMAL`](fixed-point-types.md "13.1.3 Fixed-Point Types (Exact Value) - DECIMAL, NUMERIC") (and
[`NUMERIC`](fixed-point-types.md "13.1.3 Fixed-Point Types (Exact Value) - DECIMAL, NUMERIC")) columns are represented
using a binary format that packs nine decimal (base 10) digits
into four bytes. Storage for the integer and fractional parts of
each value are determined separately. Each multiple of nine
digits requires four bytes, and the “leftover”
digits require some fraction of four bytes. The storage required
for excess digits is given by the following table.

| Leftover Digits | Number of Bytes |
| --- | --- |
| 0 | 0 |
| 1 | 1 |
| 2 | 1 |
| 3 | 2 |
| 4 | 2 |
| 5 | 3 |
| 6 | 3 |
| 7 | 4 |
| 8 | 4 |

### Date and Time Type Storage Requirements

For [`TIME`](time.md "13.2.3 The TIME Type"),
[`DATETIME`](datetime.md "13.2.2 The DATE, DATETIME, and TIMESTAMP Types"), and
[`TIMESTAMP`](datetime.md "13.2.2 The DATE, DATETIME, and TIMESTAMP Types") columns, the storage
required for tables created before MySQL 5.6.4 differs from
tables created from 5.6.4 on. This is due to a change in 5.6.4
that permits these types to have a fractional part, which
requires from 0 to 3 bytes.

| Data Type | Storage Required Before MySQL 5.6.4 | Storage Required as of MySQL 5.6.4 |
| --- | --- | --- |
| [`YEAR`](year.md "13.2.4 The YEAR Type") | 1 byte | 1 byte |
| [`DATE`](datetime.md "13.2.2 The DATE, DATETIME, and TIMESTAMP Types") | 3 bytes | 3 bytes |
| [`TIME`](time.md "13.2.3 The TIME Type") | 3 bytes | 3 bytes + fractional seconds storage |
| [`DATETIME`](datetime.md "13.2.2 The DATE, DATETIME, and TIMESTAMP Types") | 8 bytes | 5 bytes + fractional seconds storage |
| [`TIMESTAMP`](datetime.md "13.2.2 The DATE, DATETIME, and TIMESTAMP Types") | 4 bytes | 4 bytes + fractional seconds storage |

As of MySQL 5.6.4, storage for
[`YEAR`](year.md "13.2.4 The YEAR Type") and
[`DATE`](datetime.md "13.2.2 The DATE, DATETIME, and TIMESTAMP Types") remains unchanged. However,
[`TIME`](time.md "13.2.3 The TIME Type"),
[`DATETIME`](datetime.md "13.2.2 The DATE, DATETIME, and TIMESTAMP Types"), and
[`TIMESTAMP`](datetime.md "13.2.2 The DATE, DATETIME, and TIMESTAMP Types") are represented
differently. [`DATETIME`](datetime.md "13.2.2 The DATE, DATETIME, and TIMESTAMP Types") is packed
more efficiently, requiring 5 rather than 8 bytes for the
nonfractional part, and all three parts have a fractional part
that requires from 0 to 3 bytes, depending on the fractional
seconds precision of stored values.

| Fractional Seconds Precision | Storage Required |
| --- | --- |
| 0 | 0 bytes |
| 1, 2 | 1 byte |
| 3, 4 | 2 bytes |
| 5, 6 | 3 bytes |

For example, [`TIME(0)`](time.md "13.2.3 The TIME Type"),
[`TIME(2)`](time.md "13.2.3 The TIME Type"),
[`TIME(4)`](time.md "13.2.3 The TIME Type"), and
[`TIME(6)`](time.md "13.2.3 The TIME Type") use 3, 4, 5, and 6 bytes,
respectively. [`TIME`](time.md "13.2.3 The TIME Type") and
[`TIME(0)`](time.md "13.2.3 The TIME Type") are equivalent and
require the same storage.

For details about internal representation of temporal values,
see [MySQL
Internals: Important Algorithms and Structures](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/internals/en/algorithms.html).

### String Type Storage Requirements

In the following table, *`M`* represents
the declared column length in characters for nonbinary string
types and bytes for binary string types.
*`L`* represents the actual length in
bytes of a given string value.

| Data Type | Storage Required |
| --- | --- |
| `CHAR(M)` | The compact family of InnoDB row formats optimize storage for variable-length character sets. See [COMPACT Row Format Storage Characteristics](innodb-row-format.md#innodb-compact-row-format-characteristics "COMPACT Row Format Storage Characteristics"). Otherwise, *`M`* × *`w`* bytes, `<= M <=` 255, where *`w`* is the number of bytes required for the maximum-length character in the character set. |
| `BINARY(M)` | *`M`* bytes, 0 `<= M <=` 255 |
| `VARCHAR(M)`, `VARBINARY(M)` | *`L`* + 1 bytes if column values require 0 − 255 bytes, *`L`* + 2 bytes if values may require more than 255 bytes |
| [`TINYBLOB`](blob.md "13.3.4 The BLOB and TEXT Types"), [`TINYTEXT`](blob.md "13.3.4 The BLOB and TEXT Types") | *`L`* + 1 bytes, where *`L`* < 28 |
| [`BLOB`](blob.md "13.3.4 The BLOB and TEXT Types"), [`TEXT`](blob.md "13.3.4 The BLOB and TEXT Types") | *`L`* + 2 bytes, where *`L`* < 216 |
| [`MEDIUMBLOB`](blob.md "13.3.4 The BLOB and TEXT Types"), [`MEDIUMTEXT`](blob.md "13.3.4 The BLOB and TEXT Types") | *`L`* + 3 bytes, where *`L`* < 224 |
| [`LONGBLOB`](blob.md "13.3.4 The BLOB and TEXT Types"), [`LONGTEXT`](blob.md "13.3.4 The BLOB and TEXT Types") | *`L`* + 4 bytes, where *`L`* < 232 |
| `ENUM('value1','value2',...)` | 1 or 2 bytes, depending on the number of enumeration values (65,535 values maximum) |
| `SET('value1','value2',...)` | 1, 2, 3, 4, or 8 bytes, depending on the number of set members (64 members maximum) |

Variable-length string types are stored using a length prefix
plus data. The length prefix requires from one to four bytes
depending on the data type, and the value of the prefix is
*`L`* (the byte length of the string).
For example, storage for a
[`MEDIUMTEXT`](blob.md "13.3.4 The BLOB and TEXT Types") value requires
*`L`* bytes to store the value plus three
bytes to store the length of the value.

To calculate the number of bytes used to store a particular
[`CHAR`](char.md "13.3.2 The CHAR and VARCHAR Types"),
[`VARCHAR`](char.md "13.3.2 The CHAR and VARCHAR Types"), or
[`TEXT`](blob.md "13.3.4 The BLOB and TEXT Types") column value, you must take
into account the character set used for that column and whether
the value contains multibyte characters. In particular, when
using a UTF-8 Unicode character set, you must keep in mind that
not all characters use the same number of bytes.
`utf8mb3` and `utf8mb4`
character sets can require up to three and four bytes per
character, respectively. For a breakdown of the storage used for
different categories of `utf8mb3` or
`utf8mb4` characters, see
[Section 12.9, “Unicode Support”](charset-unicode.md "12.9 Unicode Support").

[`VARCHAR`](char.md "13.3.2 The CHAR and VARCHAR Types"),
[`VARBINARY`](binary-varbinary.md "13.3.3 The BINARY and VARBINARY Types"), and the
[`BLOB`](blob.md "13.3.4 The BLOB and TEXT Types") and
[`TEXT`](blob.md "13.3.4 The BLOB and TEXT Types") types are variable-length
types. For each, the storage requirements depend on these
factors:

- The actual length of the column value
- The column's maximum possible length
- The character set used for the column, because some
  character sets contain multibyte characters

For example, a `VARCHAR(255)` column can hold a
string with a maximum length of 255 characters. Assuming that
the column uses the `latin1` character set (one
byte per character), the actual storage required is the length
of the string (*`L`*), plus one byte to
record the length of the string. For the string
`'abcd'`, *`L`* is 4 and
the storage requirement is five bytes. If the same column is
instead declared to use the `ucs2` double-byte
character set, the storage requirement is 10 bytes: The length
of `'abcd'` is eight bytes and the column
requires two bytes to store lengths because the maximum length
is greater than 255 (up to 510 bytes).

The effective maximum number of *bytes* that
can be stored in a [`VARCHAR`](char.md "13.3.2 The CHAR and VARCHAR Types") or
[`VARBINARY`](binary-varbinary.md "13.3.3 The BINARY and VARBINARY Types") column is subject to
the maximum row size of 65,535 bytes, which is shared among all
columns. For a [`VARCHAR`](char.md "13.3.2 The CHAR and VARCHAR Types") column
that stores multibyte characters, the effective maximum number
of *characters* is less. For example,
`utf8mb4` characters can require up to four
bytes per character, so a [`VARCHAR`](char.md "13.3.2 The CHAR and VARCHAR Types")
column that uses the `utf8mb4` character set
can be declared to be a maximum of 16,383 characters. See
[Section 10.4.7, “Limits on Table Column Count and Row Size”](column-count-limit.md "10.4.7 Limits on Table Column Count and Row Size").

`InnoDB` encodes fixed-length fields greater
than or equal to 768 bytes in length as variable-length fields,
which can be stored off-page. For example, a
`CHAR(255)` column can exceed 768 bytes if the
maximum byte length of the character set is greater than 3, as
it is with `utf8mb4`.

The [`NDB`](mysql-cluster.md "Chapter 25 MySQL NDB Cluster 8.0") storage engine supports
variable-width columns. This means that a
[`VARCHAR`](char.md "13.3.2 The CHAR and VARCHAR Types") column in an NDB Cluster
table requires the same amount of storage as would any other
storage engine, with the exception that such values are 4-byte
aligned. Thus, the string `'abcd'` stored in a
`VARCHAR(50)` column using the
`latin1` character set requires 8 bytes (rather
than 5 bytes for the same column value in a
`MyISAM` table).

[`TEXT`](blob.md "13.3.4 The BLOB and TEXT Types"),
[`BLOB`](blob.md "13.3.4 The BLOB and TEXT Types"), and
[`JSON`](json.md "13.5 The JSON Data Type") columns are implemented
differently in the [`NDB`](mysql-cluster.md "Chapter 25 MySQL NDB Cluster 8.0") storage
engine, wherein each row in the column is made up of two
separate parts. One of these is of fixed size (256 bytes for
`TEXT` and `BLOB`, 4000 bytes
for `JSON`), and is actually stored in the
original table. The other consists of any data in excess of 256
bytes, which is stored in a hidden blob parts table. The size of
the rows in this second table are determined by the exact type
of the column, as shown in the following table:

| Type | Blob Part Size |
| --- | --- |
| [`BLOB`](blob.md "13.3.4 The BLOB and TEXT Types"), [`TEXT`](blob.md "13.3.4 The BLOB and TEXT Types") | 2000 |
| [`MEDIUMBLOB`](blob.md "13.3.4 The BLOB and TEXT Types"), [`MEDIUMTEXT`](blob.md "13.3.4 The BLOB and TEXT Types") | 4000 |
| [`LONGBLOB`](blob.md "13.3.4 The BLOB and TEXT Types"), [`LONGTEXT`](blob.md "13.3.4 The BLOB and TEXT Types") | 13948 |
| [`JSON`](json.md "13.5 The JSON Data Type") | 8100 |

This means that the size of a
[`TEXT`](blob.md "13.3.4 The BLOB and TEXT Types") column is 256 if
*`size`* <= 256 (where
*`size`* represents the size of the row);
otherwise, the size is 256 +
*`size`* + (2000 ×
(*`size`* − 256) % 2000).

No blob parts are stored separately by `NDB`
for `TINYBLOB` or `TINYTEXT`
column values.

You can increase the size of an `NDB` blob
column's blob part to the maximum of 13948 using
`NDB_COLUMN` in a column comment when creating
or altering the parent table. In NDB 8.0.30 and later, it is
also possible to set the inline size for a
`TEXT`, `BLOB`, or
`JSON` column, using
`NDB_TABLE` in a column comment. See
[NDB\_COLUMN Options](create-table-ndb-comment-options.md#create-table-ndb-comment-column-options "NDB_COLUMN Options"), for
more information.

The size of an [`ENUM`](enum.md "13.3.5 The ENUM Type") object is
determined by the number of different enumeration values. One
byte is used for enumerations with up to 255 possible values.
Two bytes are used for enumerations having between 256 and
65,535 possible values. See [Section 13.3.5, “The ENUM Type”](enum.md "13.3.5 The ENUM Type").

The size of a [`SET`](set.md "13.3.6 The SET Type") object is
determined by the number of different set members. If the set
size is *`N`*, the object occupies
`(N+7)/8` bytes,
rounded up to 1, 2, 3, 4, or 8 bytes. A
[`SET`](set.md "13.3.6 The SET Type") can have a maximum of 64
members. See [Section 13.3.6, “The SET Type”](set.md "13.3.6 The SET Type").

### Spatial Type Storage Requirements

MySQL stores geometry values using 4 bytes to indicate the SRID
followed by the WKB representation of the value. The
[`LENGTH()`](string-functions.md#function_length) function returns the
space in bytes required for value storage.

For descriptions of WKB and internal storage formats for spatial
values, see [Section 13.4.3, “Supported Spatial Data Formats”](gis-data-formats.md "13.4.3 Supported Spatial Data Formats").

### JSON Storage Requirements

In general, the storage requirement for a
[`JSON`](json.md "13.5 The JSON Data Type") column is approximately the
same as for a `LONGBLOB` or
`LONGTEXT` column; that is, the space consumed
by a JSON document is roughly the same as it would be for the
document's string representation stored in a column of one
of these types. However, there is an overhead imposed by the
binary encoding, including metadata and dictionaries needed for
lookup, of the individual values stored in the JSON document.
For example, a string stored in a JSON document requires 4 to 10
bytes additional storage, depending on the length of the string
and the size of the object or array in which it is stored.

In addition, MySQL imposes a limit on the size of any JSON
document stored in a `JSON` column such that it
cannot be any larger than the value of
[`max_allowed_packet`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_max_allowed_packet).
