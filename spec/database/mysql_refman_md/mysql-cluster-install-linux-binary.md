#### 25.3.1.1 Installing an NDB Cluster Binary Release on Linux

This section covers the steps necessary to install the correct
executables for each type of Cluster node from precompiled
binaries supplied by Oracle.

For setting up a cluster using precompiled binaries, the first
step in the installation process for each cluster host is to
download the binary archive from the
[NDB Cluster downloads
page](https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/cluster/). (For the most recent 64-bit NDB 8.0 release, this
is
`mysql-cluster-gpl-8.0.43-linux-glibc2.12-x86_64.tar.gz`.)
We assume that you have placed this file in each machine's
`/var/tmp` directory.

If you require a custom binary, see
[Section 2.8.5, “Installing MySQL Using a Development Source Tree”](installing-development-tree.md "2.8.5 Installing MySQL Using a Development Source Tree").

Note

After completing the installation, do not yet start any of the
binaries. We show you how to do so following the configuration
of the nodes (see
[Section 25.3.3, “Initial Configuration of NDB Cluster”](mysql-cluster-install-configuration.md "25.3.3 Initial Configuration of NDB Cluster")).

**SQL nodes.**
On each of the machines designated to host SQL nodes, perform
the following steps as the system `root`
user:

1. Check your `/etc/passwd` and
   `/etc/group` files (or use whatever tools
   are provided by your operating system for managing users and
   groups) to see whether there is already a
   `mysql` group and `mysql`
   user on the system. Some OS distributions create these as
   part of the operating system installation process. If they
   are not already present, create a new
   `mysql` user group, and then add a
   `mysql` user to this group:

   ```terminal
   $> groupadd mysql
   $> useradd -g mysql -s /bin/false mysql
   ```

   The syntax for **useradd** and
   **groupadd** may differ slightly on different
   versions of Unix, or they may have different names such as
   **adduser** and **addgroup**.
2. Change location to the directory containing the downloaded
   file, unpack the archive, and create a symbolic link named
   `mysql` to the `mysql`
   directory.

   Note

   The actual file and directory names vary according to the
   NDB Cluster version number.

   ```terminal
   $> cd /var/tmp
   $> tar -C /usr/local -xzvf mysql-cluster-gpl-8.0.43-linux-glibc2.12-x86_64.tar.gz
   $> ln -s /usr/local/mysql-cluster-gpl-8.0.43-linux-glibc2.12-x86_64 /usr/local/mysql
   ```
3. Change location to the `mysql` directory
   and set up the system databases using
   [**mysqld**](mysqld.md "6.3.1 mysqld — The MySQL Server")
   [`--initialize`](server-options.md#option_mysqld_initialize) as shown here:

   ```terminal
   $> cd mysql
   $> mysqld --initialize
   ```

   This generates a random password for the MySQL
   `root` account. If you do
   *not* want the random password to be
   generated, you can substitute the
   [`--initialize-insecure`](server-options.md#option_mysqld_initialize-insecure) option
   for `--initialize`. In either case, you
   should review
   [Section 2.9.1, “Initializing the Data Directory”](data-directory-initialization.md "2.9.1 Initializing the Data Directory"), for
   additional information before performing this step. See also
   [Section 6.4.2, “mysql\_secure\_installation — Improve MySQL Installation Security”](mysql-secure-installation.md "6.4.2 mysql_secure_installation — Improve MySQL Installation Security").
4. Set the necessary permissions for the MySQL server and data
   directories:

   ```terminal
   $> chown -R root .
   $> chown -R mysql data
   $> chgrp -R mysql .
   ```
5. Copy the MySQL startup script to the appropriate directory,
   make it executable, and set it to start when the operating
   system is booted up:

   ```terminal
   $> cp support-files/mysql.server /etc/rc.d/init.d/
   $> chmod +x /etc/rc.d/init.d/mysql.server
   $> chkconfig --add mysql.server
   ```

   (The startup scripts directory may vary depending on your
   operating system and version—for example, in some
   Linux distributions, it is
   `/etc/init.d`.)

   Here we use Red Hat's **chkconfig** for
   creating links to the startup scripts; use whatever means is
   appropriate for this purpose on your platform, such as
   **update-rc.d** on Debian.

Remember that the preceding steps must be repeated on each
machine where an SQL node is to reside.

**Data nodes.**
Installation of the data nodes does not require the
[**mysqld**](mysqld.md "6.3.1 mysqld — The MySQL Server") binary. Only the NDB Cluster data
node executable [**ndbd**](mysql-cluster-programs-ndbd.md "25.5.1 ndbd — The NDB Cluster Data Node Daemon") (single-threaded) or
[**ndbmtd**](mysql-cluster-programs-ndbmtd.md "25.5.3 ndbmtd — The NDB Cluster Data Node Daemon (Multi-Threaded)") (multithreaded) is required. These
binaries can also be found in the `.tar.gz`
archive. Again, we assume that you have placed this archive in
`/var/tmp`.

As system `root` (that is, after using
**sudo**, **su root**, or your
system's equivalent for temporarily assuming the system
administrator account's privileges), perform the following steps
to install the data node binaries on the data node hosts:

1. Change location to the `/var/tmp`
   directory, and extract the [**ndbd**](mysql-cluster-programs-ndbd.md "25.5.1 ndbd — The NDB Cluster Data Node Daemon") and
   [**ndbmtd**](mysql-cluster-programs-ndbmtd.md "25.5.3 ndbmtd — The NDB Cluster Data Node Daemon (Multi-Threaded)") binaries from the archive into a
   suitable directory such as
   `/usr/local/bin`:

   ```terminal
   $> cd /var/tmp
   $> tar -zxvf mysql-cluster-gpl-8.0.43-linux-glibc2.12-x86_64.tar.gz
   $> cd mysql-cluster-gpl-8.0.43-linux-glibc2.12-x86_64
   $> cp bin/ndbd /usr/local/bin/ndbd
   $> cp bin/ndbmtd /usr/local/bin/ndbmtd
   ```

   (You can safely delete the directory created by unpacking
   the downloaded archive, and the files it contains, from
   `/var/tmp` once
   [**ndb\_mgm**](mysql-cluster-programs-ndb-mgm.md "25.5.5 ndb_mgm — The NDB Cluster Management Client") and [**ndb\_mgmd**](mysql-cluster-programs-ndb-mgmd.md "25.5.4 ndb_mgmd — The NDB Cluster Management Server Daemon")
   have been copied to the executables directory.)
2. Change location to the directory into which you copied the
   files, and then make both of them executable:

   ```terminal
   $> cd /usr/local/bin
   $> chmod +x ndb*
   ```

The preceding steps should be repeated on each data node host.

Although only one of the data node executables is required to
run an NDB Cluster data node, we have shown you how to install
both [**ndbd**](mysql-cluster-programs-ndbd.md "25.5.1 ndbd — The NDB Cluster Data Node Daemon") and [**ndbmtd**](mysql-cluster-programs-ndbmtd.md "25.5.3 ndbmtd — The NDB Cluster Data Node Daemon (Multi-Threaded)") in
the preceding instructions. We recommend that you do this when
installing or upgrading NDB Cluster, even if you plan to use
only one of them, since this saves time and trouble in the event
that you later decide to change from one to the other.

Note

The data directory on each machine hosting a data node is
`/usr/local/mysql/data`. This piece of
information is essential when configuring the management node.
(See [Section 25.3.3, “Initial Configuration of NDB Cluster”](mysql-cluster-install-configuration.md "25.3.3 Initial Configuration of NDB Cluster").)

**Management nodes.**
Installation of the management node does not require the
[**mysqld**](mysqld.md "6.3.1 mysqld — The MySQL Server") binary. Only the NDB Cluster
management server ([**ndb\_mgmd**](mysql-cluster-programs-ndb-mgmd.md "25.5.4 ndb_mgmd — The NDB Cluster Management Server Daemon")) is required;
you most likely want to install the management client
([**ndb\_mgm**](mysql-cluster-programs-ndb-mgm.md "25.5.5 ndb_mgm — The NDB Cluster Management Client")) as well. Both of these binaries
also be found in the `.tar.gz` archive.
Again, we assume that you have placed this archive in
`/var/tmp`.

As system `root`, perform the following steps
to install [**ndb\_mgmd**](mysql-cluster-programs-ndb-mgmd.md "25.5.4 ndb_mgmd — The NDB Cluster Management Server Daemon") and
[**ndb\_mgm**](mysql-cluster-programs-ndb-mgm.md "25.5.5 ndb_mgm — The NDB Cluster Management Client") on the management node host:

1. Change location to the `/var/tmp`
   directory, and extract the [**ndb\_mgm**](mysql-cluster-programs-ndb-mgm.md "25.5.5 ndb_mgm — The NDB Cluster Management Client") and
   [**ndb\_mgmd**](mysql-cluster-programs-ndb-mgmd.md "25.5.4 ndb_mgmd — The NDB Cluster Management Server Daemon") from the archive into a suitable
   directory such as `/usr/local/bin`:

   ```terminal
   $> cd /var/tmp
   $> tar -zxvf mysql-cluster-gpl-8.0.43-linux-glibc2.12-x86_64.tar.gz
   $> cd mysql-cluster-gpl-8.0.43-linux-glibc2.12-x86_64
   $> cp bin/ndb_mgm* /usr/local/bin
   ```

   (You can safely delete the directory created by unpacking
   the downloaded archive, and the files it contains, from
   `/var/tmp` once
   [**ndb\_mgm**](mysql-cluster-programs-ndb-mgm.md "25.5.5 ndb_mgm — The NDB Cluster Management Client") and [**ndb\_mgmd**](mysql-cluster-programs-ndb-mgmd.md "25.5.4 ndb_mgmd — The NDB Cluster Management Server Daemon")
   have been copied to the executables directory.)
2. Change location to the directory into which you copied the
   files, and then make both of them executable:

   ```terminal
   $> cd /usr/local/bin
   $> chmod +x ndb_mgm*
   ```

In [Section 25.3.3, “Initial Configuration of NDB Cluster”](mysql-cluster-install-configuration.md "25.3.3 Initial Configuration of NDB Cluster"), we
create configuration files for all of the nodes in our example
NDB Cluster.
