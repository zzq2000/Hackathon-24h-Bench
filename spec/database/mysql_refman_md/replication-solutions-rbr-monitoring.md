### 19.4.3 Monitoring Row-based Replication

The current progress of the replication applier (SQL) thread when
using row-based replication is monitored through Performance
Schema instrument stages, enabling you to track the processing of
operations and check the amount of work completed and work
estimated. When these Performance Schema instrument stages are
enabled the [`events_stages_current`](performance-schema-events-stages-current-table.md "29.12.5.1 The events_stages_current Table")
table shows stages for applier threads and their progress. For
background information, see
[Section 29.12.5, “Performance Schema Stage Event Tables”](performance-schema-stage-tables.md "29.12.5 Performance Schema Stage Event Tables").

To track progress of all three row-based replication event types
(write, update, delete):

- Enable the three Performance Schema stages by issuing:

  ```sql
  mysql> UPDATE performance_schema.setup_instruments SET ENABLED = 'YES'
      -> WHERE NAME LIKE 'stage/sql/Applying batch of row changes%';
  ```
- Wait for some events to be processed by the replication
  applier thread and then check progress by looking into the
  [`events_stages_current`](performance-schema-events-stages-current-table.md "29.12.5.1 The events_stages_current Table") table. For
  example to get progress for `update` events
  issue:

  ```sql
  mysql> SELECT WORK_COMPLETED, WORK_ESTIMATED FROM performance_schema.events_stages_current
      -> WHERE EVENT_NAME LIKE 'stage/sql/Applying batch of row changes (update)'
  ```
- If
  [`binlog_rows_query_log_events`](replication-options-binary-log.md#sysvar_binlog_rows_query_log_events)
  is enabled, information about queries is stored in the binary
  log and is exposed in the `processlist_info`
  field. To see the original query that triggered this event:

  ```sql
  mysql> SELECT db, processlist_state, processlist_info FROM performance_schema.threads
      -> WHERE processlist_state LIKE 'stage/sql/Applying batch of row changes%' AND thread_id = N;
  ```
