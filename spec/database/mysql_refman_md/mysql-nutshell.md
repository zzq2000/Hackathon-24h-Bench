## 1.3 What Is New in MySQL 8.0

This section summarizes what has been added to, deprecated in, and
removed from MySQL 8.0. A companion section lists
MySQL server options and variables that have been added,
deprecated, or removed in MySQL 8.0; see
[Section 1.4, “Server and Status Variables and Options Added, Deprecated, or Removed in
MySQL 8.0”](added-deprecated-removed.md "1.4 Server and Status Variables and Options Added, Deprecated, or Removed in MySQL 8.0").

### Features Added in MySQL 8.0

The following features have been added to MySQL
8.0:

- **Data dictionary.**
  MySQL now incorporates a transactional data dictionary
  that stores information about database objects. In
  previous MySQL releases, dictionary data was stored in
  metadata files and nontransactional tables. For more
  information, see [Chapter 16, *MySQL Data Dictionary*](data-dictionary.md "Chapter 16 MySQL Data Dictionary").
- **Atomic data definition statements (Atomic DDL).**
  An atomic DDL statement combines the data dictionary
  updates, storage engine operations, and binary log writes
  associated with a DDL operation into a single, atomic
  transaction. For more information, see
  [Section 15.1.1, “Atomic Data Definition Statement Support”](atomic-ddl.md "15.1.1 Atomic Data Definition Statement Support").
- **Upgrade procedure.**
  Previously, after installation of a new version of MySQL,
  the MySQL server automatically upgrades the data
  dictionary tables at the next startup, after which the DBA
  is expected to invoke [**mysql\_upgrade**](mysql-upgrade.md "6.4.5 mysql_upgrade — Check and Upgrade MySQL Tables")
  manually to upgrade the system tables in the
  `mysql` schema, as well as objects in
  other schemas such as the `sys` schema
  and user schemas.

  As of MySQL 8.0.16, the server performs the tasks previously
  handled by [**mysql\_upgrade**](mysql-upgrade.md "6.4.5 mysql_upgrade — Check and Upgrade MySQL Tables"). After
  installation of a new MySQL version, the server now
  automatically performs all necessary upgrade tasks at the
  next startup and is not dependent on the DBA invoking
  [**mysql\_upgrade**](mysql-upgrade.md "6.4.5 mysql_upgrade — Check and Upgrade MySQL Tables"). In addition, the server
  updates the contents of the help tables (something
  [**mysql\_upgrade**](mysql-upgrade.md "6.4.5 mysql_upgrade — Check and Upgrade MySQL Tables") did not do). A new
  [`--upgrade`](server-options.md#option_mysqld_upgrade) server option
  provides control over how the server performs automatic data
  dictionary and server upgrade operations. For more
  information, see
  [Section 3.4, “What the MySQL Upgrade Process Upgrades”](upgrading-what-is-upgraded.md "3.4 What the MySQL Upgrade Process Upgrades").
- **Session Reuse.**
  MySQL Server now supports SSL session reuse by default
  with a timeout setting to control how long the server
  maintains a session cache that establishes the period
  during which a client is permitted to request session
  reuse for new connections. All MySQL client programs
  support session reuse. For server-side and client-side
  configuration information, see
  [Section 8.3.5, “Reusing SSL Sessions”](reusing-ssl-sessions.md "8.3.5 Reusing SSL Sessions").

  In addition, C applications now can use the C API
  capabilities to enable session reuse for encrypted
  connections (see [SSL Session Reuse](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/c-api/8.0/en/c-api-ssl-session-reuse.html)).
- **Security and account management.**
  These enhancements were added to improve security and
  enable greater DBA flexibility in account management:

  - MySQL Enterprise Audit now supports using the
    [scheduler](scheduler-component.md "7.5.5 Scheduler Component")
    component to configure and execute a recurring task to
    flush the in-memory cache. For setup instructions, see
    [Enabling the Audit Log Flush Task](audit-log-logging-configuration.md#audit-log-flush-task "Enabling the Audit Log Flush Task").
  - A new password-validation system variable permits the
    configuration and enforcement of a minimum number of
    characters that users must change when attempting to
    replace their own MySQL account passwords. This new
    verification setting is a percentage of the total
    characters in the current password. For example, if
    [`validate_password.changed_characters_percentage`](validate-password-options-variables.md#sysvar_validate_password.changed_characters_percentage)
    has a value of 50, at least half of the characters in
    the replacement account password must not be present in
    the current password, or the password is rejected. For
    more information, see
    [Section 8.4.3, “The Password Validation Component”](validate-password.md "8.4.3 The Password Validation Component").
  - MySQL Enterprise Edition now provides data masking and de-identification
    capabilities based on components, rather than being
    based on a plugin library that was introduced in MySQL
    8.0.13. MySQL Enterprise Data Masking and De-Identification components support for multibyte
    characters, masking dictionaries stored in a database
    table, and several new functions. For more information,
    see [Section 8.5.1, “Data-Masking Components Versus the Data-Masking Plugin”](data-masking-components-vs-plugin.md "8.5.1 Data-Masking Components Versus the Data-Masking Plugin").
  - Prior to MySQL 8.0.33, the `mysql`
    system database was used for MySQL Enterprise Audit's persistent
    storage of filter and user account data. For enhanced
    flexibility, the new
    [`audit_log_database`](audit-log-reference.md#sysvar_audit_log_database)
    server system variable now permits specifying other
    databases in the global schema namespace at server
    startup. The `mysql` system database is
    the default setting for table storage.
  - The grant tables in the `mysql` system
    database are now `InnoDB`
    (transactional) tables. Previously, these were
    `MyISAM` (nontransactional) tables. The
    change of grant table storage engine underlies an
    accompanying change to the behavior of
    account-management statements. Previously, an
    account-management statement (such as
    [`CREATE USER`](create-user.md "15.7.1.3 CREATE USER Statement") or
    [`DROP USER`](drop-user.md "15.7.1.5 DROP USER Statement")) that named
    multiple users could succeed for some users and fail for
    others. Now, each statement is transactional and either
    succeeds for all named users or rolls back and has no
    effect if any error occurs. The statement is written to
    the binary log if it succeeds, but not if it fails; in
    that case, rollback occurs and no changes are made. For
    more information, see [Section 15.1.1, “Atomic Data Definition Statement Support”](atomic-ddl.md "15.1.1 Atomic Data Definition Statement Support").
  - A new `caching_sha2_password`
    authentication plugin is available. Like the
    `sha256_password` plugin,
    `caching_sha2_password` implements
    SHA-256 password hashing, but uses caching to address
    latency issues at connect time. It also supports more
    transport protocols and does not require linking against
    OpenSSL for RSA key pair-based password-exchange
    capabilities. See
    [Section 8.4.1.2, “Caching SHA-2 Pluggable Authentication”](caching-sha2-pluggable-authentication.md "8.4.1.2 Caching SHA-2 Pluggable Authentication").

    The `caching_sha2_password` and
    `sha256_password` authentication
    plugins provide more secure password encryption than the
    `mysql_native_password` plugin
    (deprecated in 8.0.34), and
    `caching_sha2_password` provides better
    performance than `sha256_password`. Due
    to these superior security and performance
    characteristics of
    `caching_sha2_password`, it is now the
    preferred authentication plugin, and is also the default
    authentication plugin rather than
    `mysql_native_password`. For
    information about the implications of this change of
    default plugin for server operation and compatibility of
    the server with clients and connectors, see
    [caching\_sha2\_password as the Preferred Authentication Plugin](upgrading-from-previous-series.md#upgrade-caching-sha2-password "caching_sha2_password as the Preferred Authentication Plugin").
  - The MySQL Enterprise Edition SASL LDAP authentication plugin now supports
    GSSAPI/Kerberos as an authentication method for MySQL
    clients and servers on Linux. This is useful in Linux
    environments where applications access LDAP using
    Microsoft Active Directory, which has Kerberos enabled
    by default. See
    [LDAP Authentication Methods](ldap-pluggable-authentication.md#ldap-pluggable-authentication-auth-methods "LDAP Authentication Methods").
  - MySQL Enterprise Edition now supports an authentication method that enables
    users to authenticate to MySQL Server using Kerberos,
    provided that appropriate Kerberos tickets are available
    or can be obtained. For details, see
    [Section 8.4.1.8, “Kerberos Pluggable Authentication”](kerberos-pluggable-authentication.md "8.4.1.8 Kerberos Pluggable Authentication").
  - MySQL now supports roles, which are named collections of
    privileges. Roles can be created and dropped. Roles can
    have privileges granted to and revoked from them. Roles
    can be granted to and revoked from user accounts. The
    active applicable roles for an account can be selected
    from among those granted to the account, and can be
    changed during sessions for that account. For more
    information, see [Section 8.2.10, “Using Roles”](roles.md "8.2.10 Using Roles").
  - MySQL now incorporates the concept of user account
    categories, with system and regular users distinguished
    according to whether they have the
    [`SYSTEM_USER`](privileges-provided.md#priv_system-user) privilege.
    See [Section 8.2.11, “Account Categories”](account-categories.md "8.2.11 Account Categories").
  - Previously, it was not possible to grant privileges that
    apply globally except for certain schemas. This is now
    possible if the
    [`partial_revokes`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_partial_revokes) system
    variable is enabled. See
    [Section 8.2.12, “Privilege Restriction Using Partial Revokes”](partial-revokes.md "8.2.12 Privilege Restriction Using Partial Revokes").
  - The [`GRANT`](grant.md "15.7.1.6 GRANT Statement") statement has
    an `AS user [WITH
    ROLE]` clause that specifies additional
    information about the privilege context to use for
    statement execution. This syntax is visible at the SQL
    level, although its primary purpose is to enable uniform
    replication across all nodes of grantor privilege
    restrictions imposed by partial revokes, by causing
    those restrictions to appear in the binary log. See
    [Section 15.7.1.6, “GRANT Statement”](grant.md "15.7.1.6 GRANT Statement").
  - MySQL now maintains information about password history,
    enabling restrictions on reuse of previous passwords.
    DBAs can require that new passwords not be selected from
    previous passwords for some number of password changes
    or period of time. It is possible to establish
    password-reuse policy globally as well as on a
    per-account basis.

    It is now possible to require that attempts to change
    account passwords be verified by specifying the current
    password to be replaced. This enables DBAs to prevent
    users from changing password without proving that they
    know the current password. It is possible to establish
    password-verification policy globally as well as on a
    per-account basis.

    Accounts are now permitted to have dual passwords, which
    enables phased password changes to be performed
    seamlessly in complex multiple-server systems, without
    downtime.

    MySQL now enables administrators to configure user
    accounts such that too many consecutive login failures
    due to incorrect passwords cause temporary account
    locking. The required number of failures and the lock
    time are configurable per account.

    These new capabilities provide DBAs more complete
    control over password management. For more information,
    see [Section 8.2.15, “Password Management”](password-management.md "8.2.15 Password Management").
  - MySQL now supports FIPS mode, if compiled using OpenSSL,
    and an OpenSSL library and FIPS Object Module are
    available at runtime. FIPS mode imposes conditions on
    cryptographic operations such as restrictions on
    acceptable encryption algorithms or requirements for
    longer key lengths. See [Section 8.8, “FIPS Support”](fips-mode.md "8.8 FIPS Support").
  - The TLS context the server uses for new connections now
    is reconfigurable at runtime. This capability may be
    useful, for example, to avoid restarting a MySQL server
    that has been running so long that its SSL certificate
    has expired. See
    [Server-Side Runtime Configuration and Monitoring for Encrypted
    Connections](using-encrypted-connections.md#using-encrypted-connections-server-side-runtime-configuration "Server-Side Runtime Configuration and Monitoring for Encrypted Connections").
  - OpenSSL 1.1.1 supports the TLS v1.3 protocol for
    encrypted connections, and MySQL 8.0.16 and higher
    supports TLS v1.3 as well, if both the server and client
    are compiled using OpenSSL 1.1.1 or higher. See
    [Section 8.3.2, “Encrypted Connection TLS Protocols and Ciphers”](encrypted-connection-protocols-ciphers.md "8.3.2 Encrypted Connection TLS Protocols and Ciphers").
  - MySQL now sets the access control granted to clients on
    the named pipe to the minimum necessary for successful
    communication on Windows. Newer MySQL client software
    can open named pipe connections without any additional
    configuration. If older client software cannot be
    upgraded immediately, the new
    [`named_pipe_full_access_group`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_named_pipe_full_access_group)
    system variable can be used to give a Windows group the
    necessary permissions to open a named pipe connection.
    Membership in the full-access group should be restricted
    and temporary.
  - Previously, MySQL user accounts authenticated to the
    server using a single authentication method. As of MySQL
    8.0.27, MySQL supports multifactor authentication (MFA),
    which makes it possible to create accounts that have up
    to three authentication methods. MFA support entails
    these changes:

    - [`CREATE USER`](create-user.md "15.7.1.3 CREATE USER Statement") and
      [`ALTER USER`](alter-user.md "15.7.1.1 ALTER USER Statement") syntax has
      been extended to permit specification of multiple
      authentication methods.
    - The
      [`authentication_policy`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_authentication_policy)
      system variable enables MFA policy to be established
      by controlling how many factors can be used and the
      types of authentication permitted for each factor.
      This places constraints on how the
      authentication-related clauses of
      [`CREATE USER`](create-user.md "15.7.1.3 CREATE USER Statement") and
      [`ALTER USER`](alter-user.md "15.7.1.1 ALTER USER Statement") statements
      may be used.
    - Client programs have new
      [`--password1`](connection-options.md#option_general_password1),
      [`--password2`](connection-options.md#option_general_password2), and
      [`--password3`](connection-options.md#option_general_password3)
      command-line options for specifying multiple
      passwords. For applications that use the C API, the
      new `MYSQL_OPT_USER_PASSWORD` option
      for the
      [`mysql_options4()`](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/c-api/8.0/en/mysql-options4.html) C
      API function enables the same capability.

    In addition, MySQL Enterprise Edition now supports authentication to MySQL
    Server using devices such as smart cards, security keys,
    and biometric readers. This authentication method is
    based on the Fast Identity Online (FIDO) standard, and
    uses a pair of plugins,
    `authentication_fido` on the server
    side and `authentication_fido_client`
    on the client side. The server-side FIDO authentication
    plugin is included only in MySQL Enterprise Edition distributions. It is
    not included in MySQL community distributions. However,
    the client-side plugin is included in all distributions,
    including community distributions. This enables clients
    from any distribution to connect to a server that has
    the server-side plugin loaded.

    Multifactor authentication can use existing MySQL
    authentication methods, the new FIDO authentication
    method, or a combination of both. For more information,
    see [Section 8.2.18, “Multifactor Authentication”](multifactor-authentication.md "8.2.18 Multifactor Authentication"), and
    [Section 8.4.1.11, “FIDO Pluggable Authentication”](fido-pluggable-authentication.md "8.4.1.11 FIDO Pluggable Authentication").
- **Resource management.**
  MySQL now supports creation and management of resource
  groups, and permits assigning threads running within the
  server to particular groups so that threads execute
  according to the resources available to the group. Group
  attributes enable control over its resources, to enable or
  restrict resource consumption by threads in the group.
  DBAs can modify these attributes as appropriate for
  different workloads. Currently, CPU time is a manageable
  resource, represented by the concept of “virtual
  CPU” as a term that includes CPU cores,
  hyperthreads, hardware threads, and so forth. The server
  determines at startup how many virtual CPUs are available,
  and database administrators with appropriate privileges
  can associate these CPUs with resource groups and assign
  threads to groups. For more information, see
  [Section 7.1.16, “Resource Groups”](resource-groups.md "7.1.16 Resource Groups").
- **Table encryption management.**
  Table encryption can now be managed globally by defining
  and enforcing encryption defaults. The
  [`default_table_encryption`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_default_table_encryption)
  variable defines an encryption default for newly created
  schemas and general tablespace. The encryption default for
  a schema can also be defined using the `DEFAULT
  ENCRYPTION` clause when creating a schema. By
  default, a table inherits the encryption of the schema or
  general tablespace it is created in. Encryption defaults
  are enforced by enabling the
  [`table_encryption_privilege_check`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_table_encryption_privilege_check)
  variable. The privilege check occurs when creating or
  altering a schema or general tablespace with an encryption
  setting that differs from the
  [`default_table_encryption`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_default_table_encryption)
  setting, or when creating or altering a table with an
  encryption setting that differs from the default schema
  encryption. The
  [`TABLE_ENCRYPTION_ADMIN`](privileges-provided.md#priv_table-encryption-admin)
  privilege permits overriding default encryption settings
  when
  [`table_encryption_privilege_check`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_table_encryption_privilege_check)
  is enabled. For more information, see
  [Defining an Encryption Default for Schemas and General Tablespaces](innodb-data-encryption.md#innodb-schema-tablespace-encryption-default "Defining an Encryption Default for Schemas and General Tablespaces").
- **InnoDB enhancements.**
  These `InnoDB` enhancements were added:

  - The current maximum auto-increment counter value is
    written to the redo log each time the value changes, and
    saved to an engine-private system table on each
    checkpoint. These changes make the current maximum
    auto-increment counter value persistent across server
    restarts. Additionally:

    - A server restart no longer cancels the effect of the
      `AUTO_INCREMENT = N` table option.
      If you initialize the auto-increment counter to a
      specific value, or if you alter the auto-increment
      counter value to a larger value, the new value is
      persisted across server restarts.
    - A server restart immediately following a
      [`ROLLBACK`](commit.md "15.3.1 START TRANSACTION, COMMIT, and ROLLBACK Statements")
      operation no longer results in the reuse of
      auto-increment values that were allocated to the
      rolled-back transaction.
    - If you modify an `AUTO_INCREMENT`
      column value to a value larger than the current
      maximum auto-increment value (in an
      [`UPDATE`](update.md "15.2.17 UPDATE Statement") operation, for
      example), the new value is persisted, and subsequent
      [`INSERT`](insert.md "15.2.7 INSERT Statement") operations
      allocate auto-increment values starting from the
      new, larger value.

    For more information, see
    [Section 17.6.1.6, “AUTO\_INCREMENT Handling in InnoDB”](innodb-auto-increment-handling.md "17.6.1.6 AUTO_INCREMENT Handling in InnoDB"), and
    [InnoDB AUTO\_INCREMENT Counter Initialization](innodb-auto-increment-handling.md#innodb-auto-increment-initialization "InnoDB AUTO_INCREMENT Counter Initialization").
  - When encountering index tree corruption,
    `InnoDB` writes a corruption flag to
    the redo log, which makes the corruption flag crash
    safe. `InnoDB` also writes in-memory
    corruption flag data to an engine-private system table
    on each checkpoint. During recovery,
    `InnoDB` reads corruption flags from
    both locations and merges results before marking
    in-memory table and index objects as corrupt.
  - The `InnoDB`
    **memcached** plugin supports multiple
    `get` operations (fetching multiple
    key-value pairs in a single **memcached**
    query) and range queries. See
    [Section 17.20.4, “InnoDB memcached Multiple get and Range Query Support”](innodb-memcached-multiple-get-range-query.md "17.20.4 InnoDB memcached Multiple get and Range Query Support").
  - A new dynamic variable,
    [`innodb_deadlock_detect`](innodb-parameters.md#sysvar_innodb_deadlock_detect),
    may be used to disable deadlock detection. On high
    concurrency systems, deadlock detection can cause a
    slowdown when numerous threads wait for the same lock.
    At times, it may be more efficient to disable deadlock
    detection and rely on the
    [`innodb_lock_wait_timeout`](innodb-parameters.md#sysvar_innodb_lock_wait_timeout)
    setting for transaction rollback when a deadlock occurs.
  - The new Information Schema
    [`INNODB_CACHED_INDEXES`](information-schema-innodb-cached-indexes-table.md "28.4.5 The INFORMATION_SCHEMA INNODB_CACHED_INDEXES Table") table
    reports the number of index pages cached in the
    `InnoDB` buffer pool for each index.
  - `InnoDB` temporary tables are now
    created in the shared temporary tablespace,
    `ibtmp1`.
  - The `InnoDB`
    [tablespace
    encryption feature](innodb-data-encryption.md "17.13 InnoDB Data-at-Rest Encryption") supports encryption of redo
    log and undo log data. See
    [Redo Log Encryption](innodb-data-encryption.md#innodb-data-encryption-redo-log "Redo Log Encryption"), and
    [Undo Log Encryption](innodb-data-encryption.md#innodb-data-encryption-undo-log "Undo Log Encryption").
  - `InnoDB` supports
    `NOWAIT` and `SKIP
    LOCKED` options with `SELECT ... FOR
    SHARE` and `SELECT ... FOR
    UPDATE` locking read statements.
    `NOWAIT` causes the statement to return
    immediately if a requested row is locked by another
    transaction. `SKIP LOCKED` removes
    locked rows from the result set. See
    [Locking Read Concurrency with NOWAIT and SKIP LOCKED](innodb-locking-reads.md#innodb-locking-reads-nowait-skip-locked "Locking Read Concurrency with NOWAIT and SKIP LOCKED").

    `SELECT ... FOR SHARE` replaces
    `SELECT ... LOCK IN SHARE MODE`, but
    `LOCK IN SHARE MODE` remains available
    for backward compatibility. The statements are
    equivalent. However, `FOR UPDATE` and
    `FOR SHARE` support
    `NOWAIT`, `SKIP
    LOCKED`, and `OF
    tbl_name` options.
    See [Section 15.2.13, “SELECT Statement”](select.md "15.2.13 SELECT Statement").

    `OF
    tbl_name` applies
    locking queries to named tables.
  - `ADD PARTITION`, `DROP
    PARTITION`, `COALESCE
    PARTITION`, `REORGANIZE
    PARTITION`, and `REBUILD
    PARTITION` [`ALTER
    TABLE`](alter-table.md "15.1.9 ALTER TABLE Statement") options are supported by native
    partitioning in-place APIs and may be used with
    `ALGORITHM={COPY|INPLACE}` and
    `LOCK` clauses.

    `DROP PARTITION` with
    `ALGORITHM=INPLACE` deletes data stored
    in the partition and drops the partition. However,
    `DROP PARTITION` with
    `ALGORITHM=COPY` or
    [`old_alter_table=ON`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_old_alter_table)
    rebuilds the partitioned table and attempts to move data
    from the dropped partition to another partition with a
    compatible `PARTITION ... VALUES`
    definition. Data that cannot be moved to another
    partition is deleted.
  - The `InnoDB` storage engine now uses
    the MySQL data dictionary rather than its own storage
    engine-specific data dictionary. For information about
    the data dictionary, see
    [Chapter 16, *MySQL Data Dictionary*](data-dictionary.md "Chapter 16 MySQL Data Dictionary").
  - `mysql` system tables and data
    dictionary tables are now created in a single
    `InnoDB` tablespace file named
    `mysql.ibd` in the MySQL data
    directory. Previously, these tables were created in
    individual `InnoDB` tablespace files in
    the `mysql` database directory.
  - The following undo tablespace changes are introduced in
    MySQL 8.0:

    - By default, undo logs now reside in two undo
      tablespaces that are created when the MySQL instance
      is initialized. Undo logs are no longer created in
      the system tablespace.
    - As of MySQL 8.0.14, additional undo tablespaces can
      be created in a chosen location at runtime using
      [`CREATE
      UNDO TABLESPACE`](create-tablespace.md "15.1.21 CREATE TABLESPACE Statement") syntax.

      ```sql
      CREATE UNDO TABLESPACE tablespace_name ADD DATAFILE 'file_name.ibu';
      ```

      Undo tablespaces created using
      [`CREATE
      UNDO TABLESPACE`](create-tablespace.md "15.1.21 CREATE TABLESPACE Statement") syntax can be dropped at
      runtime using
      [`DROP
      UNDO TABLESPACE`](drop-tablespace.md "15.1.33 DROP TABLESPACE Statement") syntax.

      ```sql
      DROP UNDO TABLESPACE tablespace_name;
      ```

      [`ALTER
      UNDO TABLESPACE`](alter-tablespace.md "15.1.10 ALTER TABLESPACE Statement") syntax can be used to mark
      an undo tablespace as active or inactive.

      ```sql
      ALTER UNDO TABLESPACE tablespace_name SET {ACTIVE|INACTIVE};
      ```

      A `STATE` column that shows the
      state of a tablespace was added to the Information
      Schema
      [`INNODB_TABLESPACES`](information-schema-innodb-tablespaces-table.md "28.4.24 The INFORMATION_SCHEMA INNODB_TABLESPACES Table")
      table. An undo tablespace must be in an
      `empty` state before it can be
      dropped.
    - The
      [`innodb_undo_log_truncate`](innodb-parameters.md#sysvar_innodb_undo_log_truncate)
      variable is enabled by default.
    - The
      [`innodb_rollback_segments`](innodb-parameters.md#sysvar_innodb_rollback_segments)
      variable defines the number of rollback segments per
      undo tablespace. Previously,
      [`innodb_rollback_segments`](innodb-parameters.md#sysvar_innodb_rollback_segments)
      specified the total number of rollback segments for
      the MySQL instance. This change increases the number
      of rollback segments available for concurrent
      transactions. More rollback segments increases the
      likelihood that concurrent transactions use separate
      rollback segments for undo logs, resulting in less
      resource contention.
  - Default values for variables that affect buffer pool
    preflushing and flushing behavior were modified:

    - The
      [`innodb_max_dirty_pages_pct_lwm`](innodb-parameters.md#sysvar_innodb_max_dirty_pages_pct_lwm)
      default value is now 10. The previous default value
      of 0 disables buffer pool preflushing. A value of 10
      enables preflushing when the percentage of dirty
      pages in the buffer pool exceeds 10%. Enabling
      preflushing improves performance consistency.
    - The
      [`innodb_max_dirty_pages_pct`](innodb-parameters.md#sysvar_innodb_max_dirty_pages_pct)
      default value was increased from 75 to 90.
      `InnoDB` attempts to flush data
      from the buffer pool so that the percentage of dirty
      pages does not exceed this value. The increased
      default value permits a greater percentage of dirty
      pages in the buffer pool.
  - The default
    [`innodb_autoinc_lock_mode`](innodb-parameters.md#sysvar_innodb_autoinc_lock_mode)
    setting is now 2 (interleaved). Interleaved lock mode
    permits the execution of multi-row inserts in parallel,
    which improves concurrency and scalability. The new
    [`innodb_autoinc_lock_mode`](innodb-parameters.md#sysvar_innodb_autoinc_lock_mode)
    default setting reflects the change from statement-based
    replication to row based replication as the default
    replication type in MySQL 5.7.
    Statement-based replication requires the consecutive
    auto-increment lock mode (the previous default) to
    ensure that auto-increment values are assigned in a
    predictable and repeatable order for a given sequence of
    SQL statements, whereas row-based replication is not
    sensitive to the execution order of SQL statements. For
    more information, see
    [InnoDB AUTO\_INCREMENT Lock Modes](innodb-auto-increment-handling.md#innodb-auto-increment-lock-modes "InnoDB AUTO_INCREMENT Lock Modes").

    For systems that use statement-based replication, the
    new
    [`innodb_autoinc_lock_mode`](innodb-parameters.md#sysvar_innodb_autoinc_lock_mode)
    default setting may break applications that depend on
    sequential auto-increment values. To restore the
    previous default, set
    [`innodb_autoinc_lock_mode`](innodb-parameters.md#sysvar_innodb_autoinc_lock_mode)
    to 1.
  - Renaming a general tablespace is supported by
    [`ALTER
    TABLESPACE ... RENAME TO`](alter-tablespace.md "15.1.10 ALTER TABLESPACE Statement") syntax.
  - The
    [`--innodb-dedicated-server`](innodb-parameters.md#option_mysqld_innodb-dedicated-server)
    server option, which is disabled by default, can be used
    to have `InnoDB` automatically set
    values the following system variables according to the
    amount of memory detected on the server:

    - [`innodb_buffer_pool_size`](innodb-parameters.md#sysvar_innodb_buffer_pool_size)
    - [`innodb_log_file_size`](innodb-parameters.md#sysvar_innodb_log_file_size)
    - [`innodb_flush_method`](innodb-parameters.md#sysvar_innodb_flush_method)

    This option is intended for MySQL server instances that
    run on a dedicated server. For more information, see
    [Section 17.8.12, “Enabling Automatic InnoDB Configuration for a Dedicated MySQL Server”](innodb-dedicated-server.md "17.8.12 Enabling Automatic InnoDB Configuration for a Dedicated MySQL Server").
  - The new Information Schema
    [`INNODB_TABLESPACES_BRIEF`](information-schema-innodb-tablespaces-brief-table.md "28.4.25 The INFORMATION_SCHEMA INNODB_TABLESPACES_BRIEF Table")
    view provides space, name, path, flag, and space type
    data for `InnoDB` tablespaces.
  - The [zlib
    library](http://www.zlib.net/) version bundled with MySQL was raised
    from version 1.2.3 to version 1.2.11. MySQL implements
    compression with the help of the zlib library.

    If you use `InnoDB` compressed tables,
    see [Section 3.5, “Changes in MySQL 8.0”](upgrading-from-previous-series.md "3.5 Changes in MySQL 8.0") for
    related upgrade implications.
  - Serialized dictionary information (SDI) is present in
    all `InnoDB` tablespace files except
    for global temporary tablespace and undo tablespace
    files. SDI is serialized metadata for table and
    tablespace objects. The presence of SDI data provides
    metadata redundancy. For example, dictionary object
    metadata may be extracted from tablespace files if the
    data dictionary becomes unavailable. SDI extraction is
    performed using the [**ibd2sdi**](ibd2sdi.md "6.6.1 ibd2sdi — InnoDB Tablespace SDI Extraction Utility") tool. SDI
    data is stored in `JSON` format.

    The inclusion of SDI data in tablespace files increases
    tablespace file size. An SDI record requires a single
    index page, which is 16KB in size by default. However,
    SDI data is compressed when it is stored to reduce the
    storage footprint.
  - The `InnoDB` storage engine now
    supports atomic DDL, which ensures that DDL operations
    are either fully committed or rolled back, even if the
    server halts during the operation. For more information,
    see [Section 15.1.1, “Atomic Data Definition Statement Support”](atomic-ddl.md "15.1.1 Atomic Data Definition Statement Support").
  - Tablespace files can be moved or restored to a new
    location while the server is offline using the
    [`innodb_directories`](innodb-parameters.md#sysvar_innodb_directories)
    option. For more information, see
    [Section 17.6.3.6, “Moving Tablespace Files While the Server is Offline”](innodb-moving-data-files-offline.md "17.6.3.6 Moving Tablespace Files While the Server is Offline").
  - The following redo logging optimizations were
    implemented:

    - User threads can now write concurrently to the log
      buffer without synchronizing writes.
    - User threads can now add dirty pages to the flush
      list in a relaxed order.
    - A dedicated log thread is now responsible for
      writing the log buffer to the system buffers,
      flushing system buffers to disk, notifying user
      threads about written and flushed redo, maintaining
      the lag required for the relaxed flush list order,
      and write checkpoints.
    - System variables were added for configuring the use
      of spin delay by user threads waiting for flushed
      redo:

      - [`innodb_log_wait_for_flush_spin_hwm`](innodb-parameters.md#sysvar_innodb_log_wait_for_flush_spin_hwm):
        Defines the maximum average log flush time
        beyond which user threads no longer spin while
        waiting for flushed redo.
      - [`innodb_log_spin_cpu_abs_lwm`](innodb-parameters.md#sysvar_innodb_log_spin_cpu_abs_lwm):
        Defines the minimum amount of CPU usage below
        which user threads no longer spin while waiting
        for flushed redo.
      - [`innodb_log_spin_cpu_pct_hwm`](innodb-parameters.md#sysvar_innodb_log_spin_cpu_pct_hwm):
        Defines the maximum amount of CPU usage above
        which user threads no longer spin while waiting
        for flushed redo.
    - The
      [`innodb_log_buffer_size`](innodb-parameters.md#sysvar_innodb_log_buffer_size)
      variable is now dynamic, which permits resizing of
      the log buffer while the server is running.

    For more information, see
    [Section 10.5.4, “Optimizing InnoDB Redo Logging”](optimizing-innodb-logging.md "10.5.4 Optimizing InnoDB Redo Logging").
  - As of MySQL 8.0.12, undo logging is supported for small
    updates to large object (LOB) data, which improves
    performance of LOB updates that are 100 bytes in size or
    less. Previously, LOB updates were a minimum of one LOB
    page in size, which is less than optimal for updates
    that might only modify a few bytes. This enhancement
    builds upon support added in MySQL 8.0.4 for partial
    update of LOB data.
  - As of MySQL 8.0.12, `ALGORITHM=INSTANT`
    is supported for the following
    [`ALTER TABLE`](alter-table.md "15.1.9 ALTER TABLE Statement") operations:

    - Adding a column. This feature is also referred to as
      “Instant `ADD
      COLUMN`”. Limitations apply. See
      [Section 17.12.1, “Online DDL Operations”](innodb-online-ddl-operations.md "17.12.1 Online DDL Operations").
    - Adding or dropping a virtual column.
    - Adding or dropping a column default value.
    - Modifying the definition of an
      [`ENUM`](enum.md "13.3.5 The ENUM Type") or
      [`SET`](set.md "13.3.6 The SET Type") column.
    - Changing the index type.
    - Renaming a table.

    Operations that support
    `ALGORITHM=INSTANT` only modify
    metadata in the data dictionary. No metadata locks are
    taken on the table, and table data is unaffected, making
    the operations instantaneous. If not specified
    explicitly, `ALGORITHM=INSTANT` is used
    by default by operations that support it. If
    `ALGORITHM=INSTANT` is specified but
    not supported, the operation fails immediately with an
    error.

    For more information about operations that support
    `ALGORITHM=INSTANT`, see
    [Section 17.12.1, “Online DDL Operations”](innodb-online-ddl-operations.md "17.12.1 Online DDL Operations").
  - As of MySQL 8.0.13, the `TempTable`
    storage engine supports storage of binary large object
    (BLOB) type columns. This enhancement improves
    performance for queries that use temporary tables
    containing BLOB data. Previously, temporary tables that
    contained BLOB data were stored in the on-disk storage
    engine defined by
    [`internal_tmp_disk_storage_engine`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_internal_tmp_disk_storage_engine).
    For more information, see
    [Section 10.4.4, “Internal Temporary Table Use in MySQL”](internal-temporary-tables.md "10.4.4 Internal Temporary Table Use in MySQL").
  - As of MySQL 8.0.13, the `InnoDB`
    data-at-rest encryption feature supports general
    tablespaces. Previously, only file-per-table tablespaces
    could be encrypted. To support encryption of general
    tablespaces, [`CREATE
    TABLESPACE`](create-tablespace.md "15.1.21 CREATE TABLESPACE Statement") and [`ALTER
    TABLESPACE`](alter-tablespace.md "15.1.10 ALTER TABLESPACE Statement") syntax was extended to include an
    `ENCRYPTION` clause.

    The Information Schema
    [`INNODB_TABLESPACES`](information-schema-innodb-tablespaces-table.md "28.4.24 The INFORMATION_SCHEMA INNODB_TABLESPACES Table") table
    now includes an `ENCRYPTION` column
    that indicates whether or not a tablespace is encrypted.

    The `stage/innodb/alter tablespace
    (encryption)` Performance Schema stage
    instrument was added to permit monitoring of general
    tablespace encryption operations.
  - Disabling the
    `innodb_buffer_pool_in_core_file`
    variable reduces the size of core files by excluding
    `InnoDB` buffer pool pages. To use this
    variable, the [`core_file`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_core_file)
    variable must be enabled and the operating system must
    support the `MADV_DONTDUMP` non-POSIX
    extension to `madvise()`, which is
    supported in Linux 3.4 and later. For more information,
    see [Section 17.8.3.7, “Excluding Buffer Pool Pages from Core Files”](innodb-buffer-pool-in-core-file.md "17.8.3.7 Excluding Buffer Pool Pages from Core Files").
  - As of MySQL 8.0.13, user-created temporary tables and
    internal temporary tables created by the optimizer are
    stored in session temporary tablespaces that are
    allocated to a session from a pool of temporary
    tablespaces. When a session disconnects, its temporary
    tablespaces are truncated and released back to the pool.
    In previous releases, temporary tables were created in
    the global temporary tablespace
    (`ibtmp1`), which did not return disk
    space to the operating system after temporary tables
    were dropped.

    The
    [`innodb_temp_tablespaces_dir`](innodb-parameters.md#sysvar_innodb_temp_tablespaces_dir)
    variable defines the location where session temporary
    tablespaces are created. The default location is the
    `#innodb_temp` directory in the data
    directory.

    The
    [`INNODB_SESSION_TEMP_TABLESPACES`](information-schema-innodb-session-temp-tablespaces-table.md "28.4.22 The INFORMATION_SCHEMA INNODB_SESSION_TEMP_TABLESPACES Table")
    table provides metadata about session temporary
    tablespaces.

    The global temporary tablespace
    (`ibtmp1`) now stores rollback
    segments for changes made to user-created temporary
    tables.
  - As of MySQL 8.0.14, `InnoDB` supports
    parallel clustered index reads, which can improve
    [`CHECK TABLE`](check-table.md "15.7.3.2 CHECK TABLE Statement") performance.
    This feature does not apply to secondary index scans.
    The
    [`innodb_parallel_read_threads`](innodb-parameters.md#sysvar_innodb_parallel_read_threads)
    session variable must be set to a value greater than 1
    for parallel clustered index reads to occur. The default
    value is 4. The actual number of threads used to perform
    a parallel clustered index read is determined by the
    [`innodb_parallel_read_threads`](innodb-parameters.md#sysvar_innodb_parallel_read_threads)
    setting or the number of index subtrees to scan,
    whichever is smaller.
  - As of 8.0.14, when the server is started with
    [`--innodb-dedicated-server`](innodb-parameters.md#option_mysqld_innodb-dedicated-server),
    the size and number of log files are configured
    according to the automatically configured buffer pool
    size. Previously, log file size was configured according
    to the amount of memory detected on the server, and the
    number of log files was not configured automatically.
  - As of 8.0.14, the `ADD DATAFILE` clause
    of the [`CREATE TABLESPACE`](create-tablespace.md "15.1.21 CREATE TABLESPACE Statement")
    statement is optional, which permits users without the
    [`FILE`](privileges-provided.md#priv_file) privilege to create
    tablespaces. A [`CREATE
    TABLESPACE`](create-tablespace.md "15.1.21 CREATE TABLESPACE Statement") statement executed without an
    `ADD DATAFILE` clause implicitly
    creates a tablespace data file with a unique file name.
  - By default, when the amount of memory occupied by the
    TempTable storage engine exceeds the memory limit
    defined by the
    [`temptable_max_ram`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_temptable_max_ram)
    variable, the TempTable storage engine begins allocating
    memory-mapped temporary files from disk. As of MySQL
    8.0.16, this behavior is controlled by the
    [`temptable_use_mmap`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_temptable_use_mmap)
    variable. Disabling
    [`temptable_use_mmap`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_temptable_use_mmap)
    causes the TempTable storage engine to use
    `InnoDB` on-disk internal temporary
    tables instead of memory-mapped files as its overflow
    mechanism. For more information, see
    [Internal Temporary Table Storage Engine](internal-temporary-tables.md#internal-temporary-tables-engines "Internal Temporary Table Storage Engine").
  - As of MySQL 8.0.16, the `InnoDB`
    data-at-rest encryption feature supports encryption of
    the `mysql` system tablespace. The
    `mysql` system tablespace contains the
    `mysql` system database and the MySQL
    data dictionary tables. For more information, see
    [Section 17.13, “InnoDB Data-at-Rest Encryption”](innodb-data-encryption.md "17.13 InnoDB Data-at-Rest Encryption").
  - The
    [`innodb_spin_wait_pause_multiplier`](innodb-parameters.md#sysvar_innodb_spin_wait_pause_multiplier)
    variable, introduced in MySQL 8.0.16, provides greater
    control over the duration of spin-lock polling delays
    that occur when a thread waits to acquire a mutex or
    rw-lock. Delays can be tuned more finely to account for
    differences in PAUSE instruction duration on different
    processor architectures. For more information, see
    [Section 17.8.8, “Configuring Spin Lock Polling”](innodb-performance-spin_lock_polling.md "17.8.8 Configuring Spin Lock Polling").
  - `InnoDB` parallel read thread
    performance for large data sets was improved in MySQL
    8.0.17 through better utilization of read threads,
    through a reduction in read thread I/O for prefetch
    activity that occurs during parallel scans, and through
    support for parallel scanning of partitions.

    The parallel read thread feature is controlled by the
    [`innodb_parallel_read_threads`](innodb-parameters.md#sysvar_innodb_parallel_read_threads)
    variable. The maximum setting is now 256, which is the
    total number of threads for all client connections. If
    the thread limit is reached, connections fall back to
    using a single thread.
  - The
    [`innodb_idle_flush_pct`](innodb-parameters.md#sysvar_innodb_idle_flush_pct)
    variable, introduced in MySQL 8.0.18, permits placing a
    limit on page flushing during idle periods, which can
    help extend the life of solid state storage devices. See
    [Limiting Buffer Flushing During Idle Periods](innodb-buffer-pool-flushing.md#innodb-limit-flushing-rate "Limiting Buffer Flushing During Idle Periods").
  - Efficient sampling of `InnoDB` data for
    the purpose of generating histogram statistics is
    supported as of MySQL 8.0.19. See
    [Histogram Statistics Analysis](analyze-table.md#analyze-table-histogram-statistics-analysis "Histogram Statistics Analysis").
  - As of MySQL 8.0.20, the doublewrite buffer storage area
    resides in doublewrite files. In previous releases, the
    storage area resided in the system tablespace. Moving
    the storage area out of the system tablespace reduces
    write latency, increases throughput, and provides
    flexibility with respect to placement of doublewrite
    buffer pages. The following system variables were
    introduced for advanced doublewrite buffer
    configuration:

    - [`innodb_doublewrite_dir`](innodb-parameters.md#sysvar_innodb_doublewrite_dir)

      Defines the doublewrite buffer file directory.
    - [`innodb_doublewrite_files`](innodb-parameters.md#sysvar_innodb_doublewrite_files)

      Defines the number of doublewrite files.
    - [`innodb_doublewrite_pages`](innodb-parameters.md#sysvar_innodb_doublewrite_pages)

      Defines the maximum number of doublewrite pages per
      thread for a batch write.
    - [`innodb_doublewrite_batch_size`](innodb-parameters.md#sysvar_innodb_doublewrite_batch_size)

      Defines the number of doublewrite pages to write in
      a batch.

    For more information, see
    [Section 17.6.4, “Doublewrite Buffer”](innodb-doublewrite-buffer.md "17.6.4 Doublewrite Buffer").
  - The Contention-Aware Transaction Scheduling (CATS)
    algorithm, which prioritizes transactions that are
    waiting for locks, was improved in MySQL 8.0.20.
    Transaction scheduling weight computation is now
    performed a separate thread entirely, which improves
    computation performance and accuracy.

    The First In First Out (FIFO) algorithm, which had also
    been used for transaction scheduling, was removed. The
    FIFO algorithm was rendered redundant by CATS algorithm
    enhancements. Transaction scheduling previously
    performed by the FIFO algorithm is now performed by the
    CATS algorithm.

    A `TRX_SCHEDULE_WEIGHT` column was
    added to the
    `INFORMATION_SCHEMA.INNODB_TRX` table,
    which permits querying transaction scheduling weights
    assigned by the CATS algorithm.

    The following `INNODB_METRICS` counters
    were added for monitoring code-level transaction
    scheduling events:

    - `lock_rec_release_attempts`

      The number of attempts to release record locks.
    - `lock_rec_grant_attempts`

      The number of attempts to grant record locks.
    - `lock_schedule_refreshes`

      The number of times the wait-for graph was analyzed
      to update transaction schedule weights.

    For more information, see
    [Section 17.7.6, “Transaction Scheduling”](innodb-transaction-scheduling.md "17.7.6 Transaction Scheduling").
  - As of MySQL 8.0.21, to improve concurrency for
    operations that require access to lock queues for table
    and row resources, the lock system mutex
    (`lock_sys->mutex`) was replaced in by
    sharded latches, and lock queues were grouped into table
    and page *lock queue shards*, with
    each shard protected by a dedicated mutex. Previously,
    the single lock system mutex protected all lock queues,
    which was a point of contention on high-concurrency
    systems. The new sharded implementation permits more
    granular access to lock queues.

    The lock system mutex
    (`lock_sys->mutex`) was replaced by the
    following sharded latches:

    - A global latch
      (`lock_sys->latches.global_latch`)
      consisting of 64 read-write lock objects
      (`rw_lock_t`). Access to an
      individual lock queue requires a shared global latch
      and a latch on the lock queue shard. Operations that
      require access to all lock queues take an exclusive
      global latch, which latches all table and page lock
      queue shards.
    - Table shard latches
      (`lock_sys->latches.table_shards.mutexes`),
      implemented as an array of 512 mutexes, with each
      mutex dedicated to one of 512 table lock queue
      shards.
    - Page shard latches
      (`lock_sys->latches.page_shards.mutexes`),
      implemented as an array of 512 mutexes, with each
      mutex dedicated to one of 512 page lock queue
      shards.

    The Performance Schema
    `wait/synch/mutex/innodb/lock_mutex`
    instrument for monitoring the single lock system mutex
    was replaced by instruments for monitoring the new
    global, table shard, and page shard latches:

    - `wait/synch/sxlock/innodb/lock_sys_global_rw_lock`
    - `wait/synch/mutex/innodb/lock_sys_table_mutex`
    - `wait/synch/mutex/innodb/lock_sys_page_mutex`
  - As of MySQL 8.0.21, table and table partition data files
    created outside of the data directory using the
    `DATA DIRECTORY` clause are restricted
    to directories known to `InnoDB`. This
    change permits database administrators to control where
    tablespace data files are created and ensures that the
    data files can be found during recovery.

    General and file-per-table tablespaces data files
    (`.ibd` files) can no longer be
    created in the undo tablespace directory
    ([`innodb_undo_directory`](innodb-parameters.md#sysvar_innodb_undo_directory))
    unless that directly is known to
    `InnoDB`.

    Known directories are those defined by the
    [`datadir`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_datadir),
    [`innodb_data_home_dir`](innodb-parameters.md#sysvar_innodb_data_home_dir),
    and [`innodb_directories`](innodb-parameters.md#sysvar_innodb_directories)
    variables.

    Truncating an `InnoDB` table that
    resides in a file-per-table tablespace drops the
    existing tablespace and creates a new one. As of MySQL
    8.0.21, `InnoDB` creates the new
    tablespace in the default location and writes a warning
    to the error log if the current tablespace directory is
    unknown. To have [`TRUNCATE
    TABLE`](truncate-table.md "15.1.37 TRUNCATE TABLE Statement") create the tablespace in its current
    location, add the directory to the
    [`innodb_directories`](innodb-parameters.md#sysvar_innodb_directories)
    setting before running [`TRUNCATE
    TABLE`](truncate-table.md "15.1.37 TRUNCATE TABLE Statement").
  - As of MySQL 8.0.21, redo logging can be enabled and
    disabled using
    [`ALTER
    INSTANCE {ENABLE|DISABLE} INNODB REDO_LOG`](alter-instance.md "15.1.5 ALTER INSTANCE Statement")
    syntax. This functionality is intended for loading data
    into a new MySQL instance. Disabling redo logging helps
    speed up data loading by avoiding redo log writes.

    The new
    [`INNODB_REDO_LOG_ENABLE`](privileges-provided.md#priv_innodb-redo-log-enable)
    privilege permits enabling and disabling redo logging.

    The new
    [`Innodb_redo_log_enabled`](server-status-variables.md#statvar_Innodb_redo_log_enabled)
    status variable permits monitoring redo logging status.

    See [Disabling Redo Logging](innodb-redo-log.md#innodb-disable-redo-logging "Disabling Redo Logging").
  - At startup, `InnoDB` validates the
    paths of known tablespace files against tablespace file
    paths stored in the data dictionary in case tablespace
    files have been moved to a different location. The new
    [`innodb_validate_tablespace_paths`](innodb-parameters.md#sysvar_innodb_validate_tablespace_paths)
    variable, introduced in MySQL 8.0.21, permits disabling
    tablespace path validation. This feature is intended for
    environments where tablespaces files are not moved.
    Disabling tablespace path validation improves startup
    time on systems with a large number of tablespace files.

    For more information, see
    [Section 17.6.3.7, “Disabling Tablespace Path Validation”](innodb-disabling-tablespace-path-validation.md "17.6.3.7 Disabling Tablespace Path Validation").
  - As of MySQL 8.0.21, on storage engines that support
    atomic DDL, the
    [`CREATE
    TABLE ... SELECT`](create-table-select.md "15.1.20.4 CREATE TABLE ... SELECT Statement") statement is logged as one
    transaction in the binary log when row-based replication
    is in use. Previously, it was logged as two
    transactions, one to create the table, and the other to
    insert data. With this change,
    [`CREATE
    TABLE ... SELECT`](create-table-select.md "15.1.20.4 CREATE TABLE ... SELECT Statement") statements are now safe for
    row-based replication and permitted for use with
    GTID-based replication. For more information, see
    [Section 15.1.1, “Atomic Data Definition Statement Support”](atomic-ddl.md "15.1.1 Atomic Data Definition Statement Support").
  - Truncating an undo tablespace on a busy system could
    affect performance due to associated flushing operations
    that remove old undo tablespace pages from the buffer
    pool and flush the initial pages of the new undo
    tablespace to disk. To address this issue, the flushing
    operations are removed as of MySQL 8.0.21.

    Old undo tablespace pages are released passively as they
    become least recently used, or are removed at the next
    full checkpoint. The initial pages of the new undo
    tablespace are now redo logged instead of flushed to
    disk during the truncate operation, which also improves
    durability of the undo tablespace truncate operation.

    To prevent potential issues caused by an excessive
    number of undo tablespace truncate operations, truncate
    operations on the same undo tablespace between
    checkpoints are now limited to 64. If the limit is
    exceeded, an undo tablespace can still be made inactive,
    but it is not truncated until after the next checkpoint.

    [`INNODB_METRICS`](information-schema-innodb-metrics-table.md "28.4.21 The INFORMATION_SCHEMA INNODB_METRICS Table") counters
    associated with defunct undo truncate flushing
    operations were removed. Removed counters include:
    `undo_truncate_sweep_count`,
    `undo_truncate_sweep_usec`,
    `undo_truncate_flush_count`, and
    `undo_truncate_flush_usec`.

    See [Section 17.6.3.4, “Undo Tablespaces”](innodb-undo-tablespaces.md "17.6.3.4 Undo Tablespaces").
  - As of MySQL 8.0.22, the new
    [`innodb_extend_and_initialize`](innodb-parameters.md#sysvar_innodb_extend_and_initialize)
    variable permits configuring how
    `InnoDB` allocates space to
    file-per-table and general tablespaces on Linux. By
    default, when an operation requires additional space in
    a tablespace, `InnoDB` allocates pages
    to the tablespace and physically writes NULLs to those
    pages. This behavior affects performance if new pages
    are allocated frequently. You can disable
    [`innodb_extend_and_initialize`](innodb-parameters.md#sysvar_innodb_extend_and_initialize)
    on Linux systems to avoid physically writing NULLs to
    newly allocated tablespace pages. When
    [`innodb_extend_and_initialize`](innodb-parameters.md#sysvar_innodb_extend_and_initialize)
    is disabled, space is allocated using
    `posix_fallocate()` calls, which
    reserve space without physically writing NULLs.

    A `posix_fallocate()` operation is not
    atomic, which makes it possible for a failure to occur
    between allocating space to a tablespace file and
    updating the file metadata. Such a failure can leave
    newly allocated pages in an uninitialized state,
    resulting in a failure when `InnoDB`
    attempts to access those pages. To prevent this
    scenario, `InnoDB` writes a redo log
    record before allocating a new tablespace page. If a
    page allocation operation is interrupted, the operation
    is replayed from the redo log record during recovery.
  - As of MySQL 8.0.23, `InnoDB` supports
    encryption of doublewrite file pages belonging to
    encrypted tablespaces. The pages are encrypted using the
    encryption key of the associated tablespace. For more
    information, see
    [Section 17.13, “InnoDB Data-at-Rest Encryption”](innodb-data-encryption.md "17.13 InnoDB Data-at-Rest Encryption").
  - The [`temptable_max_mmap`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_temptable_max_mmap)
    variable, introduced in MySQL 8.0.23, defines the
    maximum amount of memory the TempTable storage engine is
    permitted to allocate from memory-mapped (MMAP) files
    before it starts storing internal temporary table data
    on disk. A setting of 0 disables allocation from MMAP
    files. For more information, see
    [Section 10.4.4, “Internal Temporary Table Use in MySQL”](internal-temporary-tables.md "10.4.4 Internal Temporary Table Use in MySQL").
  - The `AUTOEXTEND_SIZE` option,
    introduced in MySQL 8.0.23, defines the amount by which
    `InnoDB` extends the size of a
    tablespace when it becomes full, making it possible to
    extend tablespace size in larger increments. The
    `AUTOEXTEND_SIZE` option is supported
    with the [`CREATE TABLE`](create-table.md "15.1.20 CREATE TABLE Statement"),
    [`ALTER TABLE`](alter-table.md "15.1.9 ALTER TABLE Statement"),
    [`CREATE TABLESPACE`](create-tablespace.md "15.1.21 CREATE TABLESPACE Statement"), and
    [`ALTER TABLESPACE`](alter-tablespace.md "15.1.10 ALTER TABLESPACE Statement")
    statements. For more information, see
    [Section 17.6.3.9, “Tablespace AUTOEXTEND\_SIZE Configuration”](innodb-tablespace-autoextend-size.md "17.6.3.9 Tablespace AUTOEXTEND_SIZE Configuration").

    An `AUTOEXTEND_SIZE` size column was
    added to the Information Schema
    [`INNODB_TABLESPACES`](information-schema-innodb-tablespaces-table.md "28.4.24 The INFORMATION_SCHEMA INNODB_TABLESPACES Table") table.
  - The
    [`innodb_segment_reserve_factor`](innodb-parameters.md#sysvar_innodb_segment_reserve_factor)
    system variable, introduced in MySQL 8.0.26, permits
    configuring the percentage of tablespace file segment
    pages that are reserved as empty pages. For more
    information, see
    [Configuring the Percentage of Reserved File Segment Pages](innodb-file-space.md#innodb-config-reserved-file-segment-pages "Configuring the Percentage of Reserved File Segment Pages").
  - On platforms that support `fdatasync()`
    system calls, the
    [`innodb_use_fdatasync`](innodb-parameters.md#sysvar_innodb_use_fdatasync)
    variable, introduced in MySQL 8.0.26, permits using
    `fdatasync()` instead of
    `fsync()` for operating system flushes.
    An `fdatasync()` system call does not
    flush changes to file metadata unless required for
    subsequent data retrieval, providing a potential
    performance benefit.
  - As of MySQL 8.0.28, the
    [`tmp_table_size`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_tmp_table_size) variable
    defines the maximum size of any individual in-memory
    internal temporary table created by the TempTable
    storage engine. An appropriate size limit prevents
    individual queries from consuming an inordinate amount
    global TempTable resources. See
    [Internal Temporary Table Storage Engine](internal-temporary-tables.md#internal-temporary-tables-engines "Internal Temporary Table Storage Engine").
  - From MySQL 8.0.28, the
    [`innodb_open_files`](innodb-parameters.md#sysvar_innodb_open_files)
    variable, which defines the number of files
    `InnoDB` can have open at one time, can
    be set at runtime using a `SELECT
    innodb_set_open_files_limit(N)`
    statement. The statement executes a stored procedure
    that sets the new limit.

    To prevent non-LRU manged files from consuming the
    entire
    [`innodb_open_files`](innodb-parameters.md#sysvar_innodb_open_files)
    limit, non-LRU managed files are limited to 90 percent
    of the
    [`innodb_open_files`](innodb-parameters.md#sysvar_innodb_open_files)
    limit, which reserves 10 percent of the
    [`innodb_open_files`](innodb-parameters.md#sysvar_innodb_open_files) limit
    for LRU managed files.

    The [`innodb_open_files`](innodb-parameters.md#sysvar_innodb_open_files)
    limit includes temporary tablespace files, which were
    not counted toward the limit previously.
  - From MySQL 8.0.28, `InnoDB` supports
    [`ALTER TABLE
    ... RENAME COLUMN`](alter-table.md "15.1.9 ALTER TABLE Statement") operations using
    `ALGORITHM=INSTANT`.

    For more information about this and other DDL operations
    that support `ALGORITHM=INSTANT`, see
    [Section 17.12.1, “Online DDL Operations”](innodb-online-ddl-operations.md "17.12.1 Online DDL Operations").
  - From MySQL 8.0.29, `InnoDB` supports
    [`ALTER TABLE
    ... DROP COLUMN`](alter-table.md "15.1.9 ALTER TABLE Statement") operations using
    `ALGORITHM=INSTANT`.

    Prior to MySQL 8.0.29, an instantly added column could
    only be added as the last column of the table. From
    MySQL 8.0.29, an instantly added column can be added to
    any position in the table.

    Instantly added or dropped columns create a new version
    of the affected row. Up to 64 row versions are
    permitted. A new `TOTAL_ROW_VERSIONS`
    column was added to the Information Schema
    [`INNODB_TABLES`](information-schema-innodb-tables-table.md "28.4.23 The INFORMATION_SCHEMA INNODB_TABLES Table") table to
    track the number of row versions.

    For more information about DDL operations that support
    `ALGORITHM=INSTANT`, see
    [Section 17.12.1, “Online DDL Operations”](innodb-online-ddl-operations.md "17.12.1 Online DDL Operations").
  - From MySQL 8.0.30, the
    [`innodb_doublewrite`](innodb-parameters.md#sysvar_innodb_doublewrite)
    system variable supports `DETECT_ONLY`
    and `DETECT_AND_RECOVER` settings. With
    the `DETECT_ONLY` setting, database
    page content is not written to the doublewrite buffer,
    and recovery does not use the doublewrite buffer to fix
    incomplete page writes. This lightweight setting is
    intended for detecting incomplete page writes only. The
    `DETECT_AND_RECOVER` setting is
    equivalent to the existing `ON`
    setting. For more information, see
    [Section 17.6.4, “Doublewrite Buffer”](innodb-doublewrite-buffer.md "17.6.4 Doublewrite Buffer").
  - From MySQL 8.0.30, `InnoDB` supports
    dynamic configuration of redo log capacity. The
    [`innodb_redo_log_capacity`](innodb-parameters.md#sysvar_innodb_redo_log_capacity)
    system variable can be set at runtime to increase or
    decrease the total amount of disk space occupied by redo
    log files.

    With this change, the number of redo log files and their
    default location has also changed. From MySQL 8.0.30,
    `InnoDB` maintains 32 redo log files in
    the `#innodb_redo` directory in the
    data directory. Previously, `InnoDB`
    created two redo log files in the data directory by
    default, and the number and size of redo log files were
    controlled by the
    [`innodb_log_files_in_group`](innodb-parameters.md#sysvar_innodb_log_files_in_group)
    and
    [`innodb_log_file_size`](innodb-parameters.md#sysvar_innodb_log_file_size)
    variables. These two variables are now deprecated.

    When the `innodb_redo_log_capacity`
    setting is defined,
    [`innodb_log_files_in_group`](innodb-parameters.md#sysvar_innodb_log_files_in_group)
    and
    [`innodb_log_file_size`](innodb-parameters.md#sysvar_innodb_log_file_size)
    settings are ignored; otherwise, those settings are used
    to compute the
    `innodb_redo_log_capacity` setting
    ([`innodb_log_files_in_group`](innodb-parameters.md#sysvar_innodb_log_files_in_group)
    \* [`innodb_log_file_size`](innodb-parameters.md#sysvar_innodb_log_file_size)
    = `innodb_redo_log_capacity`). If none
    of those variables are set, redo log capacity is set to
    the `innodb_redo_log_capacity` default
    value, which is 104857600 bytes (100MB).

    Several status variables are provided for monitoring the
    redo log and redo log resizing operations.

    For more information, see
    [Section 17.6.5, “Redo Log”](innodb-redo-log.md "17.6.5 Redo Log").
  - With MySQL 8.0.31, there are two new status variables
    for monitoring online buffer pool resizing operations.
    The
    [`Innodb_buffer_pool_resize_status_code`](server-status-variables.md#statvar_Innodb_buffer_pool_resize_status_code)
    status variable reports a status code indicating the
    stage of an online buffer pool resizing operation. The
    [`Innodb_buffer_pool_resize_status_progress`](server-status-variables.md#statvar_Innodb_buffer_pool_resize_status_progress)
    status variable reports a percentage value indicating
    the progress of each stage.

    For more information, see
    [Section 17.8.3.1, “Configuring InnoDB Buffer Pool Size”](innodb-buffer-pool-resize.md "17.8.3.1 Configuring InnoDB Buffer Pool Size").
- **Character set support.**
  The default character set has changed from
  `latin1` to `utf8mb4`.
  The `utf8mb4` character set has several
  new collations, including
  `utf8mb4_ja_0900_as_cs`, the first
  Japanese language-specific collation available for Unicode
  in MySQL. For more information, see
  [Section 12.10.1, “Unicode Character Sets”](charset-unicode-sets.md "12.10.1 Unicode Character Sets").
- **JSON enhancements.**
  The following enhancements or additions were made to
  MySQL's JSON functionality:

  - Added the
    [`->>`](json-search-functions.md#operator_json-inline-path)
    (inline path) operator, which is equivalent to calling
    [`JSON_UNQUOTE()`](json-modification-functions.md#function_json-unquote) on the
    result of [`JSON_EXTRACT()`](json-search-functions.md#function_json-extract).

    This is a refinement of the column path operator
    [`->`](json-search-functions.md#operator_json-column-path)
    introduced in MySQL 5.7;
    `col->>"$.path"` is equivalent to
    `JSON_UNQUOTE(col->"$.path")`. The
    inline path operator can be used wherever you can use
    `JSON_UNQUOTE(JSON_EXTRACT())`, such
    [`SELECT`](select.md "15.2.13 SELECT Statement") column lists,
    `WHERE` and `HAVING`
    clauses, and `ORDER BY` and
    `GROUP BY` clauses. For more
    information, see the description of the operator, as
    well as [JSON Path Syntax](json.md#json-path-syntax "JSON Path Syntax").
  - Added two JSON aggregation functions
    [`JSON_ARRAYAGG()`](aggregate-functions.md#function_json-arrayagg) and
    [`JSON_OBJECTAGG()`](aggregate-functions.md#function_json-objectagg).
    `JSON_ARRAYAGG()` takes a column or
    expression as its argument, and aggregates the result as
    a single [`JSON`](json.md "13.5 The JSON Data Type") array. The
    expression can evaluate to any MySQL data type; this
    does not have to be a `JSON` value.
    `JSON_OBJECTAGG()` takes two columns or
    expressions which it interprets as a key and a value; it
    returns the result as a single `JSON`
    object. For more information and examples, see
    [Section 14.19, “Aggregate Functions”](aggregate-functions-and-modifiers.md "14.19 Aggregate Functions").
  - Added the JSON utility function
    [`JSON_PRETTY()`](json-utility-functions.md#function_json-pretty), which
    outputs an existing [`JSON`](json.md "13.5 The JSON Data Type")
    value in an easy-to-read format; each JSON object member
    or array value is printed on a separate line, and a
    child object or array is intended 2 spaces with respect
    to its parent.

    This function also works with a string that can be
    parsed as a JSON value.

    For more detailed information and examples, see
    [Section 14.17.8, “JSON Utility Functions”](json-utility-functions.md "14.17.8 JSON Utility Functions").
  - When sorting [`JSON`](json.md "13.5 The JSON Data Type") values
    in a query using `ORDER BY`, each value
    is now represented by a variable-length part of the sort
    key, rather than a part of a fixed 1K in size. In many
    cases this can reduce excessive usage. For example, a
    scalar `INT` or even
    `BIGINT` value actually requires very
    few bytes, so that the remainder of this space (up to
    90% or more) was taken up by padding. This change has
    the following benefits for performance:

    - Sort buffer space is now used more effectively, so
      that filesorts need not flush to disk as early or
      often as with fixed-length sort keys. This means
      that more data can be sorted in memory, avoiding
      unnecessary disk access.
    - Shorter keys can be compared more quickly than
      longer ones, providing a noticeable improvement in
      performance. This is true for sorts performed
      entirely in memory as well as for sorts that require
      writing to and reading from disk.
  - Added support in MySQL 8.0.2 for partial, in-place
    updates of `JSON` column values, which
    is more efficient than completely removing an existing
    JSON value and writing a new one in its place, as was
    done previously when updating any
    `JSON` column. For this optimization to
    be applied, the update must be applied using
    [`JSON_SET()`](json-modification-functions.md#function_json-set),
    [`JSON_REPLACE()`](json-modification-functions.md#function_json-replace), or
    [`JSON_REMOVE()`](json-modification-functions.md#function_json-remove). New
    elements cannot be added to the JSON document being
    updated; values within the document cannot take more
    space than they did before the update. See
    [Partial Updates of JSON Values](json.md#json-partial-updates "Partial Updates of JSON Values"), for a detailed
    discussion of the requirements.

    Partial updates of JSON documents can be written to the
    binary log, taking up less space than logging complete
    JSON documents. Partial updates are always logged as
    such when statement-based replication is in use. For
    this to work with row-based replication, you must first
    set
    [`binlog_row_value_options=PARTIAL_JSON`](replication-options-binary-log.md#sysvar_binlog_row_value_options);
    see this variable's description for more
    information.
  - Added the JSON utility functions
    [`JSON_STORAGE_SIZE()`](json-utility-functions.md#function_json-storage-size) and
    [`JSON_STORAGE_FREE()`](json-utility-functions.md#function_json-storage-free).
    `JSON_STORAGE_SIZE()` returns the
    storage space in bytes used for the binary
    representation of a JSON document prior to any partial
    update (see previous item).
    `JSON_STORAGE_FREE()` shows the amount
    of space remaining in a table column of type
    [`JSON`](json.md "13.5 The JSON Data Type") after it has been
    partially updated using `JSON_SET()` or
    `JSON_REPLACE()`; this is greater than
    zero if the binary representation of the new value is
    less than that of the previous value.

    Each of these functions also accepts a valid string
    representation of a JSON document. For such a value,
    `JSON_STORAGE_SIZE()` returns the space
    used by its binary representation following its
    conversion to a JSON document. For a variable containing
    the string representation of a JSON document,
    `JSON_STORAGE_FREE()` returns zero.
    Either function produces an error if its (non-null)
    argument cannot be parsed as a valid JSON document, and
    `NULL` if the argument is
    `NULL`.

    For more information and examples, see
    [Section 14.17.8, “JSON Utility Functions”](json-utility-functions.md "14.17.8 JSON Utility Functions").

    `JSON_STORAGE_SIZE()` and
    `JSON_STORAGE_FREE()` were implemented
    in MySQL 8.0.2.
  - Added support in MySQL 8.0.2 for ranges such as
    `$[1 to 5]` in XPath expressions. Also
    added support in this version for the
    `last` keyword and relative addressing,
    such that `$[last]` always selects the
    last (highest-numbered) element in the array and
    `$[last-1]` the next to last element.
    `last` and expressions using it can
    also be included in range definitions. For example,
    `$[last-2 to last-1]` returns the last
    two elements but one from an array. See
    [Searching and Modifying JSON Values](json.md#json-paths "Searching and Modifying JSON Values"), for additional information
    and examples.
  - Added a JSON merge function intended to conform to
    [RFC
    7396](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7396).
    [`JSON_MERGE_PATCH()`](json-modification-functions.md#function_json-merge-patch), when
    used on 2 JSON objects, merges them into a single JSON
    object that has as members a union of the following
    sets:

    - Each member of the first object for which there is
      no member with the same key in the second object.
    - Each member of the second object for which there is
      no member having the same key in the first object,
      and whose value is not the JSON
      `null` literal.
    - Each member having a key that exists in both
      objects, and whose value in the second object is not
      the JSON `null` literal.

    As part of this work, the
    [`JSON_MERGE()`](json-modification-functions.md#function_json-merge) function has
    been renamed
    [`JSON_MERGE_PRESERVE()`](json-modification-functions.md#function_json-merge-preserve).
    `JSON_MERGE()` continues to be
    recognized as an alias for
    `JSON_MERGE_PRESERVE()` in MySQL
    8.0, but is now deprecated and is subject
    to removal in a future version of MySQL.

    For more information and examples, see
    [Section 14.17.4, “Functions That Modify JSON Values”](json-modification-functions.md "14.17.4 Functions That Modify JSON Values").
  - Implemented “last duplicate key wins”
    normalization of duplicate keys, consistent with
    [RFC
    7159](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7159) and most JavaScript parsers. An example of
    this behavior is shown here, where only the rightmost
    member having the key `x` is preserved:

    ```sql
    mysql> SELECT JSON_OBJECT('x', '32', 'y', '[true, false]',
         >                     'x', '"abc"', 'x', '100') AS Result;
    +------------------------------------+
    | Result                             |
    +------------------------------------+
    | {"x": "100", "y": "[true, false]"} |
    +------------------------------------+
    1 row in set (0.00 sec)
    ```

    Values inserted into MySQL
    [`JSON`](json.md "13.5 The JSON Data Type") columns are also
    normalized in this way, as shown in this example:

    ```sql
    mysql> CREATE TABLE t1 (c1 JSON);

    mysql> INSERT INTO t1 VALUES ('{"x": 17, "x": "red", "x": [3, 5, 7]}');

    mysql> SELECT c1 FROM t1;
    +------------------+
    | c1               |
    +------------------+
    | {"x": [3, 5, 7]} |
    +------------------+
    ```

    This is an incompatible change from previous versions of
    MySQL, where a “first duplicate key wins”
    algorithm was used in such cases.

    See [Normalization, Merging, and Autowrapping of JSON Values](json.md#json-normalization "Normalization, Merging, and Autowrapping of JSON Values"), for more
    information and examples.
  - Added the [`JSON_TABLE()`](json-table-functions.md#function_json-table)
    function in MySQL 8.0.4. This function accepts JSON data
    and returns it as a relational table having the
    specified columns.

    This function has the syntax
    `JSON_TABLE(expr,
    path COLUMNS
    column_list) [AS]
    alias)`, where
    *`expr`* is an expression that
    returns JSON data, *`path`* is a
    JSON path applied to the source, and
    *`column_list`* is a list of
    column definitions. An example is shown here:

    ```sql
    mysql> SELECT *
        -> FROM
        ->   JSON_TABLE(
        ->     '[{"a":3,"b":"0"},{"a":"3","b":"1"},{"a":2,"b":1},{"a":0},{"b":[1,2]}]',
        ->     "$[*]" COLUMNS(
        ->       rowid FOR ORDINALITY,
        ->
        ->       xa INT EXISTS PATH "$.a",
        ->       xb INT EXISTS PATH "$.b",
        ->
        ->       sa VARCHAR(100) PATH "$.a",
        ->       sb VARCHAR(100) PATH "$.b",
        ->
        ->       ja JSON PATH "$.a",
        ->       jb JSON PATH "$.b"
        ->     )
        ->   ) AS  jt1;
    +-------+------+------+------+------+------+--------+
    | rowid | xa   | xb   | sa   | sb   | ja   | jb     |
    +-------+------+------+------+------+------+--------+
    |     1 |    1 |    1 | 3    | 0    | 3    | "0"    |
    |     2 |    1 |    1 | 3    | 1    | "3"  | "1"    |
    |     3 |    1 |    1 | 2    | 1    | 2    | 1      |
    |     4 |    1 |    0 | 0    | NULL | 0    | NULL   |
    |     5 |    0 |    1 | NULL | NULL | NULL | [1, 2] |
    +-------+------+------+------+------+------+--------+
    ```

    The JSON source expression can be any expression that
    yields a valid JSON document, including a JSON literal,
    a table column, or a function call that returns JSON
    such as [`JSON_EXTRACT(t1, data,
    '$.post.comments')`](json-search-functions.md#function_json-extract). For more information, see
    [Section 14.17.6, “JSON Table Functions”](json-table-functions.md "14.17.6 JSON Table Functions").
- **Data type support.**
  MySQL now supports use of expressions as default values in
  data type specifications. This includes the use of
  expressions as default values for the
  [`BLOB`](blob.md "13.3.4 The BLOB and TEXT Types"),
  [`TEXT`](blob.md "13.3.4 The BLOB and TEXT Types"),
  `GEOMETRY`, and
  [`JSON`](json.md "13.5 The JSON Data Type") data types, which
  previously could not be assigned default values at all.
  For details, see [Section 13.6, “Data Type Default Values”](data-type-defaults.md "13.6 Data Type Default Values").
- **Optimizer.**
  These optimizer enhancements were added:

  - MySQL now supports invisible indexes. An invisible index
    is not used by the optimizer at all, but is otherwise
    maintained normally. Indexes are visible by default.
    Invisible indexes make it possible to test the effect of
    removing an index on query performance, without making a
    destructive change that must be undone should the index
    turn out to be required. See
    [Section 10.3.12, “Invisible Indexes”](invisible-indexes.md "10.3.12 Invisible Indexes").
  - MySQL now supports descending indexes:
    `DESC` in an index definition is no
    longer ignored but causes storage of key values in
    descending order. Previously, indexes could be scanned
    in reverse order but at a performance penalty. A
    descending index can be scanned in forward order, which
    is more efficient. Descending indexes also make it
    possible for the optimizer to use multiple-column
    indexes when the most efficient scan order mixes
    ascending order for some columns and descending order
    for others. See [Section 10.3.13, “Descending Indexes”](descending-indexes.md "10.3.13 Descending Indexes").
  - MySQL now supports creation of functional index key
    parts that index expression values rather than column
    values. Functional key parts enable indexing of values
    that cannot be indexed otherwise, such as
    [`JSON`](json.md "13.5 The JSON Data Type") values. For details,
    see [Section 15.1.15, “CREATE INDEX Statement”](create-index.md "15.1.15 CREATE INDEX Statement").
  - In MySQL 8.0.14 and later, trivial
    `WHERE` conditions arising from
    constant literal expressions are removed during
    preparation, rather than later on during optimization.
    Removal of the condition earlier in the process makes it
    possible to simplify joins for queries with outer joins
    having trivial conditions, such as this one:

    ```sql
    SELECT * FROM t1 LEFT JOIN t2 ON condition_1 WHERE condition_2 OR 0 = 1
    ```

    The optimizer now sees during preparation that 0 = 1 is
    always false, making `OR 0 = 1`
    redundant, and removes it, leaving this:

    ```sql
    SELECT * FROM t1 LEFT JOIN t2 ON condition_1 where condition_2
    ```

    Now the optimizer can rewrite the query as an inner
    join, like this:

    ```sql
    SELECT * FROM t1 LEFT JOIN t2 WHERE condition_1 AND condition_2
    ```

    For more information, see
    [Section 10.2.1.9, “Outer Join Optimization”](outer-join-optimization.md "10.2.1.9 Outer Join Optimization").
  - In MySQL 8.0.16 and later, MySQL can use constant
    folding at optimization time to handle comparisons
    between a column and a constant value where the constant
    is out of range or on a range boundary with respect to
    the type of the column, rather than doing so for each
    row at execution time. For example, given a table
    `t` with a `TINYINT
    UNSIGNED` column `c`, the
    optimizer can rewrite a condition such as `WHERE
    c < 256` to `WHERE 1` (and
    optimize the condition away altogether), or
    `WHERE c >= 255` to `WHERE c
    = 255`.

    See [Section 10.2.1.14, “Constant-Folding Optimization”](constant-folding-optimization.md "10.2.1.14 Constant-Folding Optimization"), for
    more information.
  - Beginning with MySQL 8.0.16, the semijoin optimizations
    used with `IN` subqueries can now be
    applied to `EXISTS` subqueries as well.
    In addition, the optimizer now decorrelates
    trivially-correlated equality predicates in the
    `WHERE` condition attached to the
    subquery, so that they can be treated similarly to
    expressions in `IN` subqueries; this
    applies to both `EXISTS` and
    `IN` subqueries.

    For more information, see [Section 10.2.2.1, “Optimizing IN and EXISTS Subquery Predicates with Semijoin
    Transformations”](semijoins.md "10.2.2.1 Optimizing IN and EXISTS Subquery Predicates with Semijoin Transformations").
  - As of MySQL 8.0.17, the server rewrites any incomplete
    SQL predicates (that is, predicates having the form
    `WHERE
    value`, in which
    *`value`* is a column name or
    constant expression and no comparison operator is used)
    internally as `WHERE
    value <> 0`
    during the contextualization phase, so that the query
    resolver, query optimizer, and query executor need work
    only with complete predicates.

    One visible effect of this change is that, for Boolean
    values, [`EXPLAIN`](explain.md "15.8.2 EXPLAIN Statement") output
    now shows `true` and
    `false`, rather than
    `1` and `0`.

    Another effect of this change is that evaluation of a
    JSON value in an SQL boolean context performs an
    implicit comparison against JSON integer 0. Consider the
    table created and populated as shown here:

    ```sql
    mysql> CREATE TABLE test (id INT, col JSON);

    mysql> INSERT INTO test VALUES (1, '{"val":true}'), (2, '{"val":false}');
    ```

    Previously, the server attempted to convert an extracted
    `true` or `false`
    value to an SQL boolean when comparing it in an SQL
    boolean context, as shown by the following query using
    `IS TRUE`:

    ```sql
    mysql> SELECT id, col, col->"$.val" FROM test WHERE col->"$.val" IS TRUE;
    +------+---------------+--------------+
    | id   | col           | col->"$.val" |
    +------+---------------+--------------+
    |    1 | {"val": true} | true         |
    +------+---------------+--------------+
    ```

    In MySQL 8.0.17 and later, the implicit comparison of
    the extracted value with JSON integer 0 leads to a
    different result:

    ```sql
    mysql> SELECT id, col, col->"$.val" FROM test WHERE col->"$.val" IS TRUE;
    +------+----------------+--------------+
    | id   | col            | col->"$.val" |
    +------+----------------+--------------+
    |    1 | {"val": true}  | true         |
    |    2 | {"val": false} | false        |
    +------+----------------+--------------+
    ```

    Beginning with MySQL 8.0.21, you can use
    [`JSON_VALUE()`](json-search-functions.md#function_json-value) on the
    extracted value to perform type conversion prior to
    performing the test, as shown here:

    ```sql
    mysql> SELECT id, col, col->"$.val" FROM test
        ->     WHERE JSON_VALUE(col, "$.val" RETURNING UNSIGNED) IS TRUE;
    +------+---------------+--------------+
    | id   | col           | col->"$.val" |
    +------+---------------+--------------+
    |    1 | {"val": true} | true         |
    +------+---------------+--------------+
    ```

    Also beginning with MySQL 8.0.21, the server provides
    the warning Evaluating a JSON value in SQL
    boolean context does an implicit comparison against JSON
    integer 0; if this is not what you want, consider
    converting JSON to an SQL numeric type with JSON\_VALUE
    RETURNING when comparing extracted values in
    an SQL boolean context in this manner.
  - In MySQL 8.0.17 and later a `WHERE`
    condition having `NOT IN
    (subquery)` or
    `NOT EXISTS
    (subquery)` is
    transformed internally into an antijoin. (An antijoin
    returns all rows from the table for which there is no
    row in the table to which it is joined matching the join
    condition.) This removes the subquery which can result
    in faster query execution since the subquery's
    tables are now handled on the top level.

    This is similar to, and reuses, the existing `IS
    NULL` (`Not exists`)
    optimization for outer joins; see
    [EXPLAIN Extra Information](explain-output.md#explain-extra-information "EXPLAIN Extra Information").
  - Beginning with MySQL 8.0.21, a single-table
    [`UPDATE`](update.md "15.2.17 UPDATE Statement") or
    [`DELETE`](delete.md "15.2.2 DELETE Statement") statement can now
    in many cases make use of a semijoin transformation or
    subquery materialization. This applies to statements of
    the forms shown here:

    - `UPDATE t1 SET
      t1.a=value WHERE t1.a IN
      (SELECT t2.a FROM t2)`
    - `DELETE FROM t1 WHERE t1.a IN (SELECT t2.a
      FROM t2)`

    This can be done for a single-table
    `UPDATE` or `DELETE`
    meeting the following conditions:

    - The `UPDATE` or
      `DELETE` statement uses a subquery
      having a `[NOT] IN` or
      `[NOT] EXISTS` predicate.
    - The statement has no `ORDER BY`
      clause, and has no `LIMIT` clause.

      (The multi-table versions of
      `UPDATE` and
      `DELETE` do not support
      `ORDER BY` or
      `LIMIT`.)
    - The target table does not support read-before-write
      removal (relevant only for
      [`NDB`](mysql-cluster.md "Chapter 25 MySQL NDB Cluster 8.0") tables).
    - Semijoin or subquery materialization is allowed,
      based on any hints contained in the subquery and the
      value of
      [`optimizer_switch`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_optimizer_switch).

    When the semijoin optimization is used for an eligible
    single-table `DELETE` or
    `UPDATE`, this is visible in the
    optimizer trace: for a multi-table statement there is a
    `join_optimization` object in the
    trace, while there is none for a single-table statement.
    The conversion is also visible in the output of
    `EXPLAIN FORMAT=TREE` or
    [`EXPLAIN ANALYZE`](explain.md#explain-analyze "Obtaining Information with EXPLAIN ANALYZE"); a
    single-table statement shows `<not executable
    by iterator executor>`, while a multi-table
    statement reports a full plan.

    Also beginning with MySQL 8.0.21, semi-consistent reads
    are supported by multi-table `UPDATE`
    statements using [`InnoDB`](innodb-storage-engine.md "Chapter 17 The InnoDB Storage Engine")
    tables, for transaction isolation levels weaker than
    [`REPEATABLE READ`](innodb-transaction-isolation-levels.md#isolevel_repeatable-read).
  - **Improved hash join performance.**
    MySQL 8.0.23 reimplements the hash table used for hash
    joins, resulting in several improvements in hash join
    performance. This work includes a fix for an issue
    (Bug #31516149, Bug #99933) whereby only roughly 2/3
    of the memory allocated for the join buffer
    ([`join_buffer_size`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_join_buffer_size))
    could actually be used by a hash join.

    The new hash table is generally faster than the old one,
    and uses less memory for alignment, keys/values, and in
    scenarios where there are many equal keys. In addition,
    the server can now free old memory when the size of the
    hash table increases.
- **Common table expressions.**
  MySQL now supports common table expressions, both
  nonrecursive and recursive. Common table expressions
  enable use of named temporary result sets, implemented by
  permitting a [`WITH`](with.md "15.2.20 WITH (Common Table Expressions)") clause
  preceding [`SELECT`](select.md "15.2.13 SELECT Statement") statements
  and certain other statements. For more information, see
  [Section 15.2.20, “WITH (Common Table Expressions)”](with.md "15.2.20 WITH (Common Table Expressions)").

  As of MySQL 8.0.19, the recursive
  [`SELECT`](select.md "15.2.13 SELECT Statement") part of a recursive
  common table expression (CTE) supports a
  `LIMIT` clause. `LIMIT`
  with `OFFSET` is also supported. See
  [Recursive Common Table Expressions](with.md#common-table-expressions-recursive "Recursive Common Table Expressions"), for
  more information.
- **Window functions.**
  MySQL now supports window functions that, for each row
  from a query, perform a calculation using rows related to
  that row. These include functions such as
  [`RANK()`](window-function-descriptions.md#function_rank),
  [`LAG()`](window-function-descriptions.md#function_lag), and
  [`NTILE()`](window-function-descriptions.md#function_ntile). In addition,
  several existing aggregate functions now can be used as
  window functions (for example,
  [`SUM()`](aggregate-functions.md#function_sum) and
  [`AVG()`](aggregate-functions.md#function_avg)). For more
  information, see [Section 14.20, “Window Functions”](window-functions.md "14.20 Window Functions").
- **Lateral derived tables.**
  A derived table now may be preceded by the
  `LATERAL` keyword to specify that it is
  permitted to refer to (depend on) columns of preceding
  tables in the same `FROM` clause. Lateral
  derived tables make possible certain SQL operations that
  cannot be done with nonlateral derived tables or that
  require less-efficient workarounds. See
  [Section 15.2.15.9, “Lateral Derived Tables”](lateral-derived-tables.md "15.2.15.9 Lateral Derived Tables").
- **Aliases in single-table DELETE statements.**
  In MySQL 8.0.16 and later, single-table
  [`DELETE`](delete.md "15.2.2 DELETE Statement") statements support
  the use of table aliases.
- **Regular expression support.**
  Previously, MySQL used the Henry Spencer regular
  expression library to support regular expression operators
  ([`REGEXP`](regexp.md#operator_regexp),
  [`RLIKE`](regexp.md#operator_regexp)).
  Regular expression support has been reimplemented using
  International Components for Unicode (ICU), which provides
  full Unicode support and is multibyte safe. The
  [`REGEXP_LIKE()`](regexp.md#function_regexp-like) function
  performs regular expression matching in the manner of the
  [`REGEXP`](regexp.md#operator_regexp) and
  [`RLIKE`](regexp.md#operator_regexp)
  operators, which now are synonyms for that function. In
  addition, the
  [`REGEXP_INSTR()`](regexp.md#function_regexp-instr),
  [`REGEXP_REPLACE()`](regexp.md#function_regexp-replace), and
  [`REGEXP_SUBSTR()`](regexp.md#function_regexp-substr) functions
  are available to find match positions and perform
  substring substitution and extraction, respectively. The
  [`regexp_stack_limit`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_regexp_stack_limit) and
  [`regexp_time_limit`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_regexp_time_limit) system
  variables provide control over resource consumption by the
  match engine. For more information, see
  [Section 14.8.2, “Regular Expressions”](regexp.md "14.8.2 Regular Expressions"). For information about ways in
  which applications that use regular expressions may be
  affected by the implementation change, see
  [Regular Expression Compatibility Considerations](regexp.md#regexp-compatibility "Regular Expression Compatibility Considerations").

  One effect of this change is that
  `[a-zA-Z]` and `[0-9]`
  perform much better in MySQL 8.0 than
  `[[:alpha:]]` and
  `[[:digit:]]`, respectively. Existing
  applications that use the character classes in pattern
  matching should be upgraded to use the ranges instead.
- **Internal temporary tables.**
  The `TempTable` storage engine replaces
  the `MEMORY` storage engine as the
  default engine for in-memory internal temporary tables.
  The `TempTable` storage engine provides
  efficient storage for
  [`VARCHAR`](char.md "13.3.2 The CHAR and VARCHAR Types") and
  [`VARBINARY`](binary-varbinary.md "13.3.3 The BINARY and VARBINARY Types") columns. The
  [`internal_tmp_mem_storage_engine`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_internal_tmp_mem_storage_engine)
  session variable defines the storage engine for in-memory
  internal temporary tables. Permitted values are
  `TempTable` (the default) and
  `MEMORY`. The
  [`temptable_max_ram`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_temptable_max_ram)
  variable defines the maximum amount of memory that the
  `TempTable` storage engine can use before
  data is stored to disk.
- **Logging.**
  These enhancements were added to improve logging:

  - Error logging was rewritten to use the MySQL component
    architecture. Traditional error logging is implemented
    using built-in components, and logging using the system
    log is implemented as a loadable component. In addition,
    a loadable JSON log writer is available. For more
    information, see [Section 7.4.2, “The Error Log”](error-log.md "7.4.2 The Error Log").
  - From MySQL 8.0.30, error log components can be loaded
    implicitly at startup before the
    `InnoDB` storage engine is available.
    This new method of loading error log components loads
    and enables the components defined by the
    [`log_error_services`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_log_error_services)
    variable.

    Previously, error log components had to be installed
    first using [`INSTALL
    COMPONENT`](install-component.md "15.7.4.3 INSTALL COMPONENT Statement") and could only be loaded after
    `InnoDB` was fully available, as the
    list of components to load was read from the
    `mysql.components` table, which is an
    `InnoDB` table.

    Implicit loading of error log components has these
    advantages:

    - Log components are loaded earlier in the startup
      sequence, making logged information available
      sooner.
    - It helps avoid loss of buffered log information
      should a failure occur during startup.
    - Loading log components using
      [`INSTALL COMPONENT`](install-component.md "15.7.4.3 INSTALL COMPONENT Statement") is
      not required, simplifying error log configuration.

    The explicit method of loading log components using
    `INSTALL COMPONENT`
    remains supported for backward compatibility.

    For more information, see
    [Section 7.4.2.1, “Error Log Configuration”](error-log-configuration.md "7.4.2.1 Error Log Configuration").
- **Backup lock.**
  A new type of backup lock permits DML during an online
  backup while preventing operations that could result in an
  inconsistent snapshot. The new backup lock is supported by
  [`LOCK INSTANCE FOR BACKUP`](lock-instance-for-backup.md "15.3.5 LOCK INSTANCE FOR BACKUP and UNLOCK INSTANCE Statements")
  and
  [`UNLOCK
  INSTANCE`](lock-instance-for-backup.md "15.3.5 LOCK INSTANCE FOR BACKUP and UNLOCK INSTANCE Statements") syntax. The
  [`BACKUP_ADMIN`](privileges-provided.md#priv_backup-admin) privilege is
  required to use these statements.
- **Replication.**
  The following enhancements have been made to MySQL
  Replication:

  - MySQL Replication now supports binary logging of partial
    updates to JSON documents using a compact binary format,
    saving space in the log over logging complete JSON
    documents. Such compact logging is done automatically
    when statement-based logging is in use, and can be
    enabled by setting the new
    `binlog_row_value_options` system
    variable to `PARTIAL_JSON`. For more
    information, see [Partial Updates of JSON Values](json.md#json-partial-updates "Partial Updates of JSON Values"),
    as well as the description of
    [`binlog_row_value_options`](replication-options-binary-log.md#sysvar_binlog_row_value_options).
- **Connection management.**
  MySQL Server now permits a TCP/IP port to be configured
  specifically for administrative connections. This provides
  an alternative to the single administrative connection
  that is permitted on the network interfaces used for
  ordinary connections even when
  [`max_connections`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_max_connections)
  connections are already established. See
  [Section 7.1.12.1, “Connection Interfaces”](connection-interfaces.md "7.1.12.1 Connection Interfaces").

  MySQL now provides more control over the use of compression
  to minimize the number of bytes sent over connections to the
  server. Previously, a given connection was either
  uncompressed or used the `zlib` compression
  algorithm. Now, it is also possible to use the
  `zstd` algorithm, and to select a
  compression level for `zstd` connections.
  The permitted compression algorithms can be configured on
  the server side, as well as on the connection-origination
  side for connections by client programs and by servers
  participating in source/replica replication or Group
  Replication. For more information, see
  [Section 6.2.8, “Connection Compression Control”](connection-compression-control.md "6.2.8 Connection Compression Control").
- **Configuration.**
  The maximum permitted length of host names throughout
  MySQL has been raised to 255 ASCII characters, up from the
  previous limit of 60 characters. This applies to, for
  example, host name-related columns in the data dictionary,
  `mysql` system schema, Performance
  Schema, `INFORMATION_SCHEMA`, and
  `sys` schema; the
  `MASTER_HOST` value for the
  [`CHANGE MASTER TO`](change-master-to.md "15.4.2.1 CHANGE MASTER TO Statement") statement;
  the `Host` column in
  [`SHOW PROCESSLIST`](show-processlist.md "15.7.7.29 SHOW PROCESSLIST Statement") statement
  output; host names in account names (such as used in
  account-management statements and in
  `DEFINER` attributes); and host
  name-related command options and system variables.

  Caveats:

  - The increase in permitted host name length can affect
    tables with indexes on host name columns. For example,
    tables in the `mysql` system schema
    that index host names now have an explicit
    `ROW_FORMAT` attribute of
    `DYNAMIC` to accommodate longer index
    values.
  - Some file name-valued configuration settings might be
    constructed based on the server host name. The permitted
    values are constrained by the underlying operating
    system, which may not permit file names long enough to
    include 255-character host names. This affects the
    [`general_log_file`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_general_log_file),
    [`log_error`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_log_error),
    [`pid_file`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_pid_file),
    [`relay_log`](replication-options-replica.md#sysvar_relay_log), and
    [`slow_query_log_file`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_slow_query_log_file)
    system variables and corresponding options. If host
    name-based values are too long for the OS, explicit
    shorter values must be provided.
  - Although the server now supports 255-character host
    names, connections to the server established using the
    [`--ssl-mode=VERIFY_IDENTITY`](connection-options.md#option_general_ssl-mode)
    option are constrained by maximum host name length
    supported by OpenSSL. Host name matches pertain to two
    fields of SSL certificates, which have maximum lengths
    as follows: Common Name: maximum length 64; Subject
    Alternative Name: maximum length as per RFC#1034.
- **Plugins.**
  Previously, MySQL plugins could be written in C or C++.
  MySQL header files used by plugins now contain C++ code,
  which means that plugins must be written in C++, not C.
- **C API.**
  The MySQL C API now supports asynchronous functions for
  nonblocking communication with the MySQL server. Each
  function is the asynchronous counterpart to an existing
  synchronous function. The synchronous functions block if
  reads from or writes to the server connection must wait.
  The asynchronous functions enable an application to check
  whether work on the server connection is ready to proceed.
  If not, the application can perform other work before
  checking again later. See
  [C API Asynchronous Interface](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/c-api/8.0/en/c-api-asynchronous-interface.html).
- **Additional target types for casts.**
  The functions [`CAST()`](cast-functions.md#function_cast) and
  [`CONVERT()`](cast-functions.md#function_convert) now support
  conversions to types
  [`DOUBLE`](floating-point-types.md "13.1.4 Floating-Point Types (Approximate Value) - FLOAT, DOUBLE"),
  [`FLOAT`](floating-point-types.md "13.1.4 Floating-Point Types (Approximate Value) - FLOAT, DOUBLE"), and
  [`REAL`](floating-point-types.md "13.1.4 Floating-Point Types (Approximate Value) - FLOAT, DOUBLE"). Added in MySQL
  8.0.17. See [Section 14.10, “Cast Functions and Operators”](cast-functions.md "14.10 Cast Functions and Operators").
- **JSON schema validation.**
  MySQL 8.0.17 adds two functions
  [`JSON_SCHEMA_VALID()`](json-validation-functions.md#function_json-schema-valid) and
  [`JSON_SCHEMA_VALIDATION_REPORT()`](json-validation-functions.md#function_json-schema-validation-report)
  for validating JSON documents again JSON schemas.
  `JSON_SCHEMA_VALID()` returns TRUE (1) if
  the document validates against the schema and FALSE (0) if
  it does not.
  `JSON_SCHEMA_VALIDATION_REPORT()` returns
  a JSON document containing detailed information about the
  results of the validation. The following statements apply
  to both of these functions:

  - The schema must conform to Draft 4 of the JSON Schema
    specification.
  - `required` attributes are supported.
  - External resources and the `$ref`
    keyword are not supported.
  - Regular expression patterns are supported; invalid
    patterns are silently ignored.

  See [Section 14.17.7, “JSON Schema Validation Functions”](json-validation-functions.md "14.17.7 JSON Schema Validation Functions"), for more
  information and examples.
- **Multi-valued indexes.**
  Beginning with MySQL 8.0.17,
  [`InnoDB`](innodb-storage-engine.md "Chapter 17 The InnoDB Storage Engine") supports the creation
  of a multi-valued index, which is a secondary index
  defined on a [`JSON`](json.md "13.5 The JSON Data Type") column
  that stores an array of values and which can have multiple
  index records for a single data record. Such an index uses
  a key part definition such as
  `CAST(data->'$.zipcode' AS UNSIGNED
  ARRAY)`. A multi-valued index is used
  automatically by the MySQL optimizer for suitable queries,
  as can be viewed in the output of
  [`EXPLAIN`](explain.md "15.8.2 EXPLAIN Statement").

  As part of this work, MySQL adds a new function
  [`JSON_OVERLAPS()`](json-search-functions.md#function_json-overlaps) and a new
  [`MEMBER OF()`](json-search-functions.md#operator_member-of) operator for
  working with [`JSON`](json.md "13.5 The JSON Data Type") documents,
  additionally extending the
  [`CAST()`](cast-functions.md#function_cast) function with a new
  `ARRAY` keyword, as described in the
  following list:

  - `JSON_OVERLAPS()` compares two
    [`JSON`](json.md "13.5 The JSON Data Type") documents. If they
    contain any key-value pairs or array elements in common,
    the function returns TRUE (1); otherwise it returns
    FALSE (0). If both values are scalars, the function
    performs a simple test for equality. If one argument is
    a JSON array and the other is a scalar, the scalar is
    treated as an array element. Thus,
    `JSON_OVERLAPS()` acts as a complement
    to [`JSON_CONTAINS()`](json-search-functions.md#function_json-contains).
  - `MEMBER OF()` tests whether the first
    operand (a scalar or JSON document) is a member of the
    JSON array passed as the second operand, returning TRUE
    (1) if it is, and FALSE (0) if it is not. No type
    conversion of the operand is performed.
  - `CAST(expression AS
    type ARRAY)` permits
    creation of a functional index by casting the JSON array
    found in a JSON document at
    *`json_path`* to an SQL array.
    Type specifiers are limited to those already supported
    by `CAST()`, with the exception of
    `BINARY` (not supported). This usage of
    `CAST()` (and the
    `ARRAY` keyword) is supported only by
    [`InnoDB`](innodb-storage-engine.md "Chapter 17 The InnoDB Storage Engine"), and only for the
    creation of a multi-valued index.

  For detailed information about multi-valued indexes,
  including examples, see
  [Multi-Valued Indexes](create-index.md#create-index-multi-valued "Multi-Valued Indexes").
  [Section 14.17.3, “Functions That Search JSON Values”](json-search-functions.md "14.17.3 Functions That Search JSON Values"), provides
  information about `JSON_OVERLAPS()` and
  `MEMBER OF()`, along with examples of use.
- **Hintable time\_zone.**
  As of MySQL 8.0.17, the
  [`time_zone`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_time_zone) session
  variable is hintable using
  [`SET_VAR`](optimizer-hints.md#optimizer-hints-set-var "Variable-Setting Hint Syntax").
- **Redo Log Archiving.**
  As of MySQL 8.0.17, `InnoDB` supports
  redo log archiving. Backup utilities that copy redo log
  records may sometimes fail to keep pace with redo log
  generation while a backup operation is in progress,
  resulting in lost redo log records due to those records
  being overwritten. The redo log archiving feature
  addresses this issue by sequentially writing redo log
  records to an archive file. Backup utilities can copy redo
  log records from the archive file as necessary, thereby
  avoiding the potential loss of data. For more information,
  see [Redo Log Archiving](innodb-redo-log.md#innodb-redo-log-archiving "Redo Log Archiving").
- **The Clone Plugin.**
  As of MySQL 8.0.17, MySQL provides a clone plugin that
  permits cloning `InnoDB` data locally or
  from a remote MySQL server instance. A local cloning
  operation stores cloned data on the same server or node
  where the MySQL instance runs. A remote cloning operation
  transfers cloned data over the network from a donor MySQL
  server instance to the recipient server or node where the
  cloning operation was initiated.

  The clone plugin supports replication. In addition to
  cloning data, a cloning operation extracts and transfers
  replication coordinates from the donor and applies them on
  the recipient, which enables using the clone plugin for
  provisioning Group Replication members and replicas. Using
  the clone plugin for provisioning is considerably faster and
  more efficient than replicating a large number of
  transactions. Group Replication members can also be
  configured to use the clone plugin as an alternative method
  of recovery, so that members automatically choose the most
  efficient way to retrieve group data from seed members.

  For more information, see [Section 7.6.7, “The Clone Plugin”](clone-plugin.md "7.6.7 The Clone Plugin"),
  and [Section 20.5.4.2, “Cloning for Distributed Recovery”](group-replication-cloning.md "20.5.4.2 Cloning for Distributed Recovery").

  As of MySQL 8.0.27, concurrent DDL operations on the donor
  MySQL Server instance are permitted while a cloning
  operation is in progress. Previously, a backup lock was held
  during the cloning operation, preventing concurrent DDL on
  the donor. To revert to the previous behavior of blocking
  concurrent DDL on the donor during a clone operation, enable
  the [`clone_block_ddl`](clone-plugin-options-variables.md#sysvar_clone_block_ddl)
  variable. See [Section 7.6.7.4, “Cloning and Concurrent DDL”](clone-plugin-concurrent-ddl.md "7.6.7.4 Cloning and Concurrent DDL").

  As of MySQL 8.0.29, the
  [`clone_delay_after_data_drop`](clone-plugin-options-variables.md#sysvar_clone_delay_after_data_drop)
  variable permits specifying a delay period immediately after
  removing existing data on the recipient MySQL Server
  instance at the start of a remote cloning operation. The
  delay is intended to provide enough time for the file system
  on the recipient host to free space before data is cloned
  from the donor MySQL Server instance. Certain file systems
  free space asynchronously in a background process. On these
  file systems, cloning data too soon after dropping existing
  data can result in clone operation failures due to
  insufficient space. The maximum delay period is 3600 seconds
  (1 hour). The default setting is 0 (no delay).

  As of MySQL 8.0.37, cloning is allowed between different
  point releases. In other words, only the major and minor
  version numbers must match when previously the point release
  number also had to match.

  For example, clone functionality now permits cloning 8.0.37
  to 8.0.41 or 8.0.51 to 8.0.39. Previous restrictions still
  apply to versions older than 8.0.37, so cloning the likes of
  8.0.36 to 8.0.42 or vice-versa is not permitted.
- **Hash Join Optimization.**
  Beginning with MySQL 8.0.18, a hash join is used whenever
  each pair of tables in a join includes at least one
  equi-join condition, and no indexes apply to any join
  condition. A hash join does not require indexes, although
  it can be used with indexes applying to single-table
  predicates only. A hash join is more efficient in most
  cases than the block-nested loop algorithm. Joins such as
  those shown here can be optimized in this manner:

  ```sql
  SELECT *
      FROM t1
      JOIN t2
          ON t1.c1=t2.c1;

  SELECT *
      FROM t1
      JOIN t2
          ON (t1.c1 = t2.c1 AND t1.c2 < t2.c2)
      JOIN t3
          ON (t2.c1 = t3.c1)
  ```

  Hash joins can also be used for Cartesian
  products—that is, when no join condition is specified.

  You can see when the hash join optimization is being used
  for a particular query using
  [`EXPLAIN
  FORMAT=TREE`](explain.md "15.8.2 EXPLAIN Statement") or [`EXPLAIN
  ANALYZE`](explain.md#explain-analyze "Obtaining Information with EXPLAIN ANALYZE"). (In MySQL 8.0.20 and later, you can also
  use `EXPLAIN`, omitting
  `FORMAT=TREE`.)

  The amount of memory available to a hash join is limited by
  the value of
  [`join_buffer_size`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_join_buffer_size). A hash
  join that requires more than this much memory is executed on
  disk; the number of disk files that can be used by an
  on-disk hash join is limited by
  [`open_files_limit`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_open_files_limit).

  As of MySQL 8.0.19, the
  [`hash_join`](switchable-optimizations.md#optflag_hash-join) optimizer switch
  which was introduced in MySQL 8.0.18 no longer supported
  (hash\_join=on still appears as part of the value of
  optimizer\_switch, but setting it no longer has any effect).
  The [`HASH_JOIN`](optimizer-hints.md#optimizer-hints-table-level "Table-Level Optimizer Hints") and
  `NO_HASH_JOIN` optimizer hints are also no
  longer supported. The switch and the hint are both now
  deprecated; expect them to be removed in a future MySQL
  release. In MySQL 8.0.18 and later, hash joins can be
  disabled using the [`NO_BNL`](optimizer-hints.md#optimizer-hints-table-level "Table-Level Optimizer Hints")
  optimizer switch.

  In MySQL 8.0.20 and later, block nested loop is no longer
  used in the MySQL server, and a hash join is employed any
  time a block nested loop would have been used previously,
  even when the query contains no equi-join conditions. This
  applies to inner non-equijoins, semijoins, antijoins, left
  outer joins, and right outer joins. The
  [`block_nested_loop`](switchable-optimizations.md#optflag_block-nested-loop) flag for
  the [`optimizer_switch`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_optimizer_switch) system
  variable as well as the
  [`BNL`](optimizer-hints.md#optimizer-hints-table-level "Table-Level Optimizer Hints") and
  `NO_BNL` optimizer hints are still
  supported, but henceforth control use of hash joins only. In
  addition, both inner and outer joins (including semijoins
  and antijoins) can now employ batched key access (BKA),
  which allocates join buffer memory incrementally so that
  individual queries need not use up large amounts of
  resources that they do not actually require for resolution.
  BKA for inner joins only is supported starting with MySQL
  8.0.18.

  MySQL 8.0.20 also replaces the executor used in previous
  versions of MySQL with the iterator executor. This work
  includes replacement of the old index subquery engines that
  governed queries of the form `WHERE
  value IN (SELECT
  column FROM
  table WHERE ...)` for
  those `IN` queries which have not been
  optimized as semijoins, as well as queries materialized in
  the same form, which formerly depended on the old executor.

  For more information and examples, see
  [Section 10.2.1.4, “Hash Join Optimization”](hash-joins.md "10.2.1.4 Hash Join Optimization"). See also
  [Batched Key Access Joins](bnl-bka-optimization.md#bka-optimization "Batched Key Access Joins").
- **EXPLAIN ANALYZE Statement.**
  A new form of the [`EXPLAIN`](explain.md "15.8.2 EXPLAIN Statement")
  statement, [`EXPLAIN ANALYZE`](explain.md#explain-analyze "Obtaining Information with EXPLAIN ANALYZE"),
  is implemented in MySQL 8.0.18, providing expanded
  information about the execution of
  [`SELECT`](select.md "15.2.13 SELECT Statement") statements in
  `TREE` format for each iterator used in
  processing the query, and making it possible to compare
  estimated cost with the actual cost of the query. This
  information includes startup cost, total cost, number of
  rows returned by this iterator, and the number of loops
  executed.

  In MySQL 8.0.21 and later, this statement also supports a
  `FORMAT=TREE` specifier.
  `TREE` is the only supported format.

  See [Obtaining Information with EXPLAIN ANALYZE](explain.md#explain-analyze "Obtaining Information with EXPLAIN ANALYZE"), for more information.
- **Query cast injection.**
  In version 8.0.18 and later, MySQL injects cast operations
  into the query item tree inside expressions and conditions
  in which the data type of the argument and the expected
  data type do not match. This has no effect on query
  results or speed of execution, but makes the query as
  executed equivalent to one which is compliant with the SQL
  standard while maintaining backwards compatibility with
  previous releases of MySQL.

  Such implicit casts are now performed between temporal types
  ([`DATE`](datetime.md "13.2.2 The DATE, DATETIME, and TIMESTAMP Types"),
  [`DATETIME`](datetime.md "13.2.2 The DATE, DATETIME, and TIMESTAMP Types"),
  [`TIMESTAMP`](datetime.md "13.2.2 The DATE, DATETIME, and TIMESTAMP Types"),
  [`TIME`](time.md "13.2.3 The TIME Type")) and numeric types
  ([`SMALLINT`](integer-types.md "13.1.2 Integer Types (Exact Value) - INTEGER, INT, SMALLINT, TINYINT, MEDIUMINT, BIGINT"),
  [`TINYINT`](integer-types.md "13.1.2 Integer Types (Exact Value) - INTEGER, INT, SMALLINT, TINYINT, MEDIUMINT, BIGINT"),
  [`MEDIUMINT`](integer-types.md "13.1.2 Integer Types (Exact Value) - INTEGER, INT, SMALLINT, TINYINT, MEDIUMINT, BIGINT"),
  [`INT`](integer-types.md "13.1.2 Integer Types (Exact Value) - INTEGER, INT, SMALLINT, TINYINT, MEDIUMINT, BIGINT")/[`INTEGER`](integer-types.md "13.1.2 Integer Types (Exact Value) - INTEGER, INT, SMALLINT, TINYINT, MEDIUMINT, BIGINT"),
  [`BIGINT`](integer-types.md "13.1.2 Integer Types (Exact Value) - INTEGER, INT, SMALLINT, TINYINT, MEDIUMINT, BIGINT");
  [`DECIMAL`](fixed-point-types.md "13.1.3 Fixed-Point Types (Exact Value) - DECIMAL, NUMERIC")/[`NUMERIC`](fixed-point-types.md "13.1.3 Fixed-Point Types (Exact Value) - DECIMAL, NUMERIC");
  [`FLOAT`](floating-point-types.md "13.1.4 Floating-Point Types (Approximate Value) - FLOAT, DOUBLE"),
  [`DOUBLE`](floating-point-types.md "13.1.4 Floating-Point Types (Approximate Value) - FLOAT, DOUBLE"),
  [`REAL`](floating-point-types.md "13.1.4 Floating-Point Types (Approximate Value) - FLOAT, DOUBLE");
  [`BIT`](bit-type.md "13.1.5 Bit-Value Type - BIT")) whenever they are
  compared using any of the standard numeric comparison
  operators
  ([`=`](assignment-operators.md#operator_assign-equal),
  [`>=`](comparison-operators.md#operator_greater-than-or-equal),
  [`>`](comparison-operators.md#operator_greater-than),
  [`<`](comparison-operators.md#operator_less-than),
  [`<=`](comparison-operators.md#operator_less-than-or-equal),
  [`<>`](comparison-operators.md#operator_not-equal)/[`!=`](comparison-operators.md#operator_not-equal),
  or
  [`<=>`](comparison-operators.md#operator_equal-to)).
  In this case, any value that is not already a
  `DOUBLE` is cast as one. Cast injection is
  also now performed for comparisons between
  [`DATE`](datetime.md "13.2.2 The DATE, DATETIME, and TIMESTAMP Types") or
  [`TIME`](time.md "13.2.3 The TIME Type") values and
  [`DATETIME`](datetime.md "13.2.2 The DATE, DATETIME, and TIMESTAMP Types") values, where the
  arguments are cast whenever necessary as
  `DATETIME`.

  Beginning with MySQL 8.0.21, such casts are also performed
  when comparing string types with other types. String types
  that are cast include [`CHAR`](char.md "13.3.2 The CHAR and VARCHAR Types"),
  [`VARCHAR`](char.md "13.3.2 The CHAR and VARCHAR Types"),
  [`BINARY`](binary-varbinary.md "13.3.3 The BINARY and VARBINARY Types"),
  [`VARBINARY`](binary-varbinary.md "13.3.3 The BINARY and VARBINARY Types"),
  [`BLOB`](blob.md "13.3.4 The BLOB and TEXT Types"),
  [`TEXT`](blob.md "13.3.4 The BLOB and TEXT Types"),
  [`ENUM`](enum.md "13.3.5 The ENUM Type"), and
  [`SET`](set.md "13.3.6 The SET Type"). When comparing a value
  of a string type with a numeric type or
  `YEAR`, the string cast is to
  `DOUBLE`; if the type of the other argument
  is not `FLOAT`, `DOUBLE`,
  or `REAL`, it is also cast to
  `DOUBLE`. When comparing a string type to a
  `DATETIME` or `TIMESTAMP`
  value, the string is cast is to `DATETIME`;
  when comparing a string type with `DATE`,
  the string is cast to `DATE`.

  It is possible to see when casts are injected into a given
  query by viewing the output of [`EXPLAIN
  ANALYZE`](explain.md#explain-analyze "Obtaining Information with EXPLAIN ANALYZE"), `EXPLAIN FORMAT=JSON`,
  or, as shown here, `EXPLAIN FORMAT=TREE`:

  ```sql
  mysql> CREATE TABLE d (dt DATETIME, d DATE, t TIME);
  Query OK, 0 rows affected (0.62 sec)

  mysql> CREATE TABLE n (i INT, d DECIMAL, f FLOAT, dc DECIMAL);
  Query OK, 0 rows affected (0.51 sec)

  mysql> CREATE TABLE s (c CHAR(25), vc VARCHAR(25),
      ->     bn BINARY(50), vb VARBINARY(50), b BLOB, t TEXT,
      ->     e ENUM('a', 'b', 'c'), se SET('x' ,'y', 'z'));
  Query OK, 0 rows affected (0.50 sec)

  mysql> EXPLAIN FORMAT=TREE SELECT * from d JOIN n ON d.dt = n.i\G
  *************************** 1. row ***************************
  EXPLAIN: -> Inner hash join (cast(d.dt as double) = cast(n.i as double))
  (cost=0.70 rows=1)
      -> Table scan on n  (cost=0.35 rows=1)
      -> Hash
          -> Table scan on d  (cost=0.35 rows=1)

  mysql> EXPLAIN FORMAT=TREE SELECT * from s JOIN d ON d.dt = s.c\G
  *************************** 1. row ***************************
  EXPLAIN: -> Inner hash join (d.dt = cast(s.c as datetime(6)))  (cost=0.72 rows=1)
      -> Table scan on d  (cost=0.37 rows=1)
      -> Hash
          -> Table scan on s  (cost=0.35 rows=1)

  1 row in set (0.01 sec)

  mysql> EXPLAIN FORMAT=TREE SELECT * from n JOIN s ON n.d = s.c\G
  *************************** 1. row ***************************
  EXPLAIN: -> Inner hash join (cast(n.d as double) = cast(s.c as double))  (cost=0.70 rows=1)
      -> Table scan on s  (cost=0.35 rows=1)
      -> Hash
          -> Table scan on n  (cost=0.35 rows=1)

  1 row in set (0.00 sec)
  ```

  Such casts can also be seen by executing `EXPLAIN
  [FORMAT=TRADITIONAL]`, in which case it is also
  necessary to issue [`SHOW
  WARNINGS`](show-warnings.md "15.7.7.42 SHOW WARNINGS Statement") after executing the
  `EXPLAIN` statement.
- **Time zone support for TIMESTAMP and DATETIME.**
  As of MySQL 8.0.19, the server accepts a time zone offset
  with inserted datetime
  ([`TIMESTAMP`](datetime.md "13.2.2 The DATE, DATETIME, and TIMESTAMP Types") and
  [`DATETIME`](datetime.md "13.2.2 The DATE, DATETIME, and TIMESTAMP Types")) values. This
  offset uses the same format as that employed when setting
  the [`time_zone`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_time_zone) system
  variable, except that a leading zero is required when the
  hours portion of the offset is less than 10, and
  `'-00:00'` is not allowed. Examples of
  datetime literals that include time zone offsets are
  `'2019-12-11 10:40:30-05:00'`,
  `'2003-04-14 03:30:00+10:00'`, and
  `'2020-01-01 15:35:45+05:30'`.

  Time zone offsets are not displayed when selecting datetime
  values.

  Datetime literals incorporating time zone offsets can be
  used as prepared statement parameter values.

  As part of this work, the value used to set the
  [`time_zone`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_time_zone) system variable
  is now also restricted to the range
  `-13:59` to `+14:00`,
  inclusive. (It remains possible to assign name values to
  `time_zone` such as
  `'EST'`,
  `'Posix/Australia/Brisbane'`, and
  `'Europe/Stockholm'` to this variable,
  provided that the MySQL time zone tables are loaded; see
  [Populating the Time Zone Tables](time-zone-support.md#time-zone-installation "Populating the Time Zone Tables")).

  For more information and examples, see
  [Section 7.1.15, “MySQL Server Time Zone Support”](time-zone-support.md "7.1.15 MySQL Server Time Zone Support"), as well as
  [Section 13.2.2, “The DATE, DATETIME, and TIMESTAMP Types”](datetime.md "13.2.2 The DATE, DATETIME, and TIMESTAMP Types").
- **Precise information for JSON schema CHECK constraint failures.**
  When using
  [`JSON_SCHEMA_VALID()`](json-validation-functions.md#function_json-schema-valid) to
  specify a `CHECK` constraint, MySQL
  8.0.19 and later provides precise information about the
  reasons for failures of such constraints.

  For examples and more information, see
  [JSON\_SCHEMA\_VALID() and CHECK constraints](json-validation-functions.md#json-validation-functions-constraints "JSON_SCHEMA_VALID() and CHECK constraints"). See
  also [Section 15.1.20.6, “CHECK Constraints”](create-table-check-constraints.md "15.1.20.6 CHECK Constraints").
- **Row and column aliases with ON DUPLICATE KEY UPDATE.**
  Beginning with MySQL 8.0.19, it is possible to reference
  the row to be inserted, and, optionally, its columns,
  using aliases. Consider the following
  [`INSERT`](insert.md "15.2.7 INSERT Statement") statement on a table
  `t` having columns `a`
  and `b`:

  ```sql
  INSERT INTO t SET a=9,b=5
      ON DUPLICATE KEY UPDATE a=VALUES(a)+VALUES(b);
  ```

  Using the alias `new` for the new row, and,
  in some cases, the aliases `m` and
  `n` for this row's columns, the
  `INSERT` statement can be rewritten in many
  different ways, some examples of which are shown here:

  ```sql
  INSERT INTO t SET a=9,b=5 AS new
      ON DUPLICATE KEY UPDATE a=new.a+new.b;

  INSERT INTO t VALUES(9,5) AS new
      ON DUPLICATE KEY UPDATE a=new.a+new.b;

  INSERT INTO t SET a=9,b=5 AS new(m,n)
      ON DUPLICATE KEY UPDATE a=m+n;

  INSERT INTO t VALUES(9,5) AS new(m,n)
      ON DUPLICATE KEY UPDATE a=m+n;
  ```

  For more information and examples, see
  [Section 15.2.7.2, “INSERT ... ON DUPLICATE KEY UPDATE Statement”](insert-on-duplicate.md "15.2.7.2 INSERT ... ON DUPLICATE KEY UPDATE Statement").
- **SQL standard explicit table clause and table value constructor.**
  Added table value constructors and explicit table clauses
  according to the SQL standard. These are implemented in
  MySQL 8.0.19, respectively, as the
  [`TABLE`](table.md "15.2.16 TABLE Statement") statement and the
  [`VALUES`](values.md "15.2.19 VALUES Statement") statement.

  The [`TABLE`](table.md "15.2.16 TABLE Statement") statement has the
  format `TABLE
  table_name`, and is
  equivalent to `SELECT * FROM
  table_name`. It supports
  `ORDER BY` and `LIMIT`
  clauses ( the latter with optional
  `OFFSET`), but does not allow for the
  selection of individual table columns.
  `TABLE` can be used anywhere that you would
  employ the equivalent [`SELECT`](select.md "15.2.13 SELECT Statement")
  statement; this includes joins, unions,
  [`INSERT ...
  SELECT`](insert-select.md "15.2.7.1 INSERT ... SELECT Statement"), [`REPLACE`](replace.md "15.2.12 REPLACE Statement"),
  [`CREATE
  TABLE ... SELECT`](create-table-select.md "15.1.20.4 CREATE TABLE ... SELECT Statement") statements, and subqueries. For
  example:

  - `TABLE t1 UNION TABLE t2` is equivalent
    to `SELECT * FROM t1 UNION SELECT * FROM
    t2`
  - `CREATE TABLE t2 TABLE t1` is
    equivalent to `CREATE TABLE t2 SELECT * FROM
    t1`
  - `SELECT a FROM t1 WHERE b > ANY (TABLE
    t2)` is equivalent to `SELECT a FROM t1
    WHERE b > ANY (SELECT * FROM t2)`.

  [`VALUES`](values.md "15.2.19 VALUES Statement") can be used to supply
  a table value to an [`INSERT`](insert.md "15.2.7 INSERT Statement"),
  [`REPLACE`](replace.md "15.2.12 REPLACE Statement"), or
  [`SELECT`](select.md "15.2.13 SELECT Statement") statement, and
  consists of the `VALUES` keyword followed
  by a series of row constructors (`ROW()`)
  separated by commas. For example, the statement
  `INSERT INTO t1 VALUES ROW(1,2,3), ROW(4,5,6),
  ROW(7,8,9)` provides an SQL-compliant equivalent to
  the MySQL-specific `INSERT INTO t1 VALUES (1,2,3),
  (4,5,6), (7,8,9)`. You can also select from a
  [`VALUES`](values.md "15.2.19 VALUES Statement") table value
  constructor just as you would a table, bearing in mind that
  you must supply a table alias when doing so, and use this
  [`SELECT`](select.md "15.2.13 SELECT Statement") just as you would any
  other; this includes joins, unions, and subqueries.

  For more information about `TABLE` and
  `VALUES`, and for examples of their use,
  see the following sections of this documentation:

  - [Section 15.2.16, “TABLE Statement”](table.md "15.2.16 TABLE Statement")

  - [Section 15.1.20.4, “CREATE TABLE ... SELECT Statement”](create-table-select.md "15.1.20.4 CREATE TABLE ... SELECT Statement")
  - [Section 15.2.7.1, “INSERT ... SELECT Statement”](insert-select.md "15.2.7.1 INSERT ... SELECT Statement")

- **Optimizer hints for FORCE INDEX, IGNORE INDEX.**
  MySQL 8.0 introduces index-level optimizer hints which
  serve as analogs to the traditional index hints as
  described in [Section 10.9.4, “Index Hints”](index-hints.md "10.9.4 Index Hints"). The new hints
  are listed here, along with their `FORCE
  INDEX` or `IGNORE INDEX`
  equivalents:

  - [`GROUP_INDEX`](optimizer-hints.md#optimizer-hints-index-level "Index-Level Optimizer Hints"):
    Equivalent to `FORCE INDEX FOR GROUP
    BY`

    [`NO_GROUP_INDEX`](optimizer-hints.md#optimizer-hints-index-level "Index-Level Optimizer Hints"):
    Equivalent to `IGNORE INDEX FOR GROUP
    BY`
  - [`JOIN_INDEX`](optimizer-hints.md#optimizer-hints-index-level "Index-Level Optimizer Hints"): Equivalent
    to `FORCE INDEX FOR JOIN`

    [`NO_JOIN_INDEX`](optimizer-hints.md#optimizer-hints-index-level "Index-Level Optimizer Hints"):
    Equivalent to `IGNORE INDEX FOR JOIN`
  - [`ORDER_INDEX`](optimizer-hints.md#optimizer-hints-index-level "Index-Level Optimizer Hints"):
    Equivalent to `FORCE INDEX FOR ORDER
    BY`

    [`NO_ORDER_INDEX`](optimizer-hints.md#optimizer-hints-index-level "Index-Level Optimizer Hints"):
    Equivalent to `IGNORE INDEX FOR ORDER
    BY`
  - [`INDEX`](optimizer-hints.md#optimizer-hints-index-level "Index-Level Optimizer Hints"): Same as
    [`GROUP_INDEX`](optimizer-hints.md#optimizer-hints-index-level "Index-Level Optimizer Hints") plus
    [`JOIN_INDEX`](optimizer-hints.md#optimizer-hints-index-level "Index-Level Optimizer Hints") plus
    [`ORDER_INDEX`](optimizer-hints.md#optimizer-hints-index-level "Index-Level Optimizer Hints");
    equivalent to `FORCE INDEX` with no
    modifier

    [`NO_INDEX`](optimizer-hints.md#optimizer-hints-index-level "Index-Level Optimizer Hints"): Same as
    [`NO_GROUP_INDEX`](optimizer-hints.md#optimizer-hints-index-level "Index-Level Optimizer Hints") plus
    [`NO_JOIN_INDEX`](optimizer-hints.md#optimizer-hints-index-level "Index-Level Optimizer Hints") plus
    [`NO_ORDER_INDEX`](optimizer-hints.md#optimizer-hints-index-level "Index-Level Optimizer Hints");
    equivalent to `IGNORE INDEX` with no
    modifier

  For example, the following two queries are equivalent:

  ```sql
  SELECT a FROM t1 FORCE INDEX (i_a) FOR JOIN WHERE a=1 AND b=2;

  SELECT /*+ JOIN_INDEX(t1 i_a) */ a FROM t1 WHERE a=1 AND b=2;
  ```

  The optimizer hints listed previously follow the same basic
  rules for syntax and usage as existing index-level optimizer
  hints.

  These optimizer hints are intended to replace `FORCE
  INDEX` and `IGNORE INDEX`, which
  we plan to deprecate in a future MySQL release, and
  subsequently to remove from MySQL. They do not implement a
  single exact equivalent for `USE INDEX`;
  instead, you can employ one or more of
  [`NO_INDEX`](optimizer-hints.md#optimizer-hints-index-level "Index-Level Optimizer Hints"),
  [`NO_JOIN_INDEX`](optimizer-hints.md#optimizer-hints-index-level "Index-Level Optimizer Hints"),
  [`NO_GROUP_INDEX`](optimizer-hints.md#optimizer-hints-index-level "Index-Level Optimizer Hints"), or
  [`NO_ORDER_INDEX`](optimizer-hints.md#optimizer-hints-index-level "Index-Level Optimizer Hints") to achieve
  the same effect.

  For further information and examples of use, see
  [Index-Level Optimizer Hints](optimizer-hints.md#optimizer-hints-index-level "Index-Level Optimizer Hints").
- **JSON\_VALUE() function.**
  MySQL 8.0.21 implements a new function
  [`JSON_VALUE()`](json-search-functions.md#function_json-value) intended to
  simplify indexing of [`JSON`](json.md "13.5 The JSON Data Type")
  columns. In its most basic form, it takes as arguments a
  JSON document and a JSON path pointing to a single value
  in that document, as well as (optionally) allowing you to
  specify a return type with the
  `RETURNING` keyword.
  `JSON_VALUE(json_doc,
  path RETURNING
  type)` is equivalent
  to this:

  ```sql
  CAST(
      JSON_UNQUOTE( JSON_EXTRACT(json_doc, path) )
      AS type
  );
  ```

  You can also specify `ON EMPTY`,
  `ON ERROR`, or both clauses, similar to
  those employed with
  [`JSON_TABLE()`](json-table-functions.md#function_json-table).

  You can use `JSON_VALUE()` to create an
  index on an expression on a `JSON` column
  like this:

  ```sql
  CREATE TABLE t1(
      j JSON,
      INDEX i1 ( (JSON_VALUE(j, '$.id' RETURNING UNSIGNED)) )
  );

  INSERT INTO t1 VALUES ROW('{"id": "123", "name": "shoes", "price": "49.95"}');
  ```

  A query using this expression, such as that shown here, can
  make use of the index:

  ```sql
  SELECT j->"$.name" as name, j->"$.price" as price
      FROM t1
      WHERE JSON_VALUE(j, '$.id' RETURNING UNSIGNED) = 123;
  ```

  In many cases, this is simpler than creating a generated
  column from the `JSON` column and then
  creating an index on the generated column.

  For more information and examples, see the description of
  [`JSON_VALUE()`](json-search-functions.md#function_json-value).
- **User comments and user attributes.**
  MySQL 8.0.21 introduces the ability to set user comments
  and user attributes when creating or updating user
  accounts. A user comment consists of arbitrary text passed
  as the argument to a `COMMENT` clause
  used with a [`CREATE USER`](create-user.md "15.7.1.3 CREATE USER Statement") or
  [`ALTER USER`](alter-user.md "15.7.1.1 ALTER USER Statement") statement. A
  user attribute consists of data in the form of a JSON
  object passed as the argument to an
  `ATTRIBUTE` clause used with either of
  these two statements. The attribute can contain any valid
  key-value pairs in JSON object notation. Only one of
  `COMMENT` or `ATTRIBUTE`
  can be used in a single `CREATE USER` or
  `ALTER USER` statement.

  User comments and user attributes are stored together
  internally as a JSON object, the comment text as the value
  of an element having `comment` as its key.
  This information can be retrieved from the
  `ATTRIBUTE` column of the Information
  Schema [`USER_ATTRIBUTES`](information-schema-user-attributes-table.md "28.3.46 The INFORMATION_SCHEMA USER_ATTRIBUTES Table") table;
  since it is in JSON format, you can use MySQL's JSON
  function and operators to parse its contents (see
  [Section 14.17, “JSON Functions”](json-functions.md "14.17 JSON Functions")). Successive changes to the
  user attribute are merged with its current value as when
  using the [`JSON_MERGE_PATCH()`](json-modification-functions.md#function_json-merge-patch)
  function.

  Example:

  ```sql
  mysql> CREATE USER 'mary'@'localhost' COMMENT 'This is Mary Smith\'s account';
  Query OK, 0 rows affected (0.33 sec)

  mysql> ALTER USER 'mary'@'localhost'
      -≫     ATTRIBUTE '{"fname":"Mary", "lname":"Smith"}';
  Query OK, 0 rows affected (0.14 sec)

  mysql> ALTER USER 'mary'@'localhost'
      -≫     ATTRIBUTE '{"email":"mary.smith@example.com"}';
  Query OK, 0 rows affected (0.12 sec)

  mysql> SELECT
      ->    USER,
      ->    HOST,
      ->    ATTRIBUTE->>"$.fname" AS 'First Name',
      ->    ATTRIBUTE->>"$.lname" AS 'Last Name',
      ->    ATTRIBUTE->>"$.email" AS 'Email',
      ->    ATTRIBUTE->>"$.comment" AS 'Comment'
      -> FROM INFORMATION_SCHEMA.USER_ATTRIBUTES
      -> WHERE USER='mary' AND HOST='localhost'\G
  *************************** 1. row ***************************
        USER: mary
        HOST: localhost
  First Name: Mary
   Last Name: Smith
       Email: mary.smith@example.com
     Comment: This is Mary Smith's account
  1 row in set (0.00 sec)
  ```

  For more information and examples, see
  [Section 15.7.1.3, “CREATE USER Statement”](create-user.md "15.7.1.3 CREATE USER Statement"), [Section 15.7.1.1, “ALTER USER Statement”](alter-user.md "15.7.1.1 ALTER USER Statement"),
  and
  [Section 28.3.46, “The INFORMATION\_SCHEMA USER\_ATTRIBUTES Table”](information-schema-user-attributes-table.md "28.3.46 The INFORMATION_SCHEMA USER_ATTRIBUTES Table").
- **New optimizer\_switch flags.**
  MySQL 8.0.21 adds two new flags for the
  [`optimizer_switch`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_optimizer_switch) system
  variable, as described in the following list:

  - [`prefer_ordering_index`](switchable-optimizations.md#optflag_prefer-ordering-index)
    flag

    By default, MySQL attempts to use an ordered index for
    any `ORDER BY` or `GROUP
    BY` query that has a `LIMIT`
    clause, whenever the optimizer determines that this
    would result in faster execution. Because it is possible
    in some cases that choosing a different optimization for
    such queries actually performs better, it is now
    possible to disable this optimization by setting the
    [`prefer_ordering_index`](switchable-optimizations.md#optflag_prefer-ordering-index)
    flag to `off`.

    The default value for this flag is
    `on`.
  - [`subquery_to_derived`](switchable-optimizations.md#optflag_subquery-to-derived)
    flag

    When this flag is set to `on`, the
    optimizer transforms eligible scalar subqueries into
    joins on derived tables. For example, the query
    `SELECT * FROM t1 WHERE t1.a > (SELECT
    COUNT(a) FROM t2)` is rewritten as
    `SELECT t1.a FROM t1 JOIN ( SELECT COUNT(t2.a)
    AS c FROM t2 ) AS d WHERE t1.a > d.c`.

    This optimization can be applied to a subquery which is
    part of a `SELECT`,
    `WHERE`, `JOIN`, or
    `HAVING` clause; contains one or more
    aggregate functions but no `GROUP BY`
    clause; is not correlated; and does not use any
    nondeterministic functions.

    The optimization can also be applied to a table subquery
    which is the argument to `IN`,
    `NOT IN`, `EXISTS`, or
    `NOT EXISTS`, and which does not
    contain a `GROUP BY`. For example, the
    query `SELECT * FROM t1 WHERE t1.b < 0 OR
    t1.a IN (SELECT t2.a + 1 FROM t2)` is rewritten
    as `SELECT a, b FROM t1 LEFT JOIN (SELECT
    DISTINCT 1 AS e1, t2.a AS e2 FROM t2) d ON t1.a + 1 =
    d.e2 WHERE t1.b < 0 OR d.e1 IS NOT NULL`.

    Starting with MySQL 8.0.24, this optimization can also
    be applied to a correlated scalar subquery by applying
    an extra grouping to it, and then an outer join on the
    lifted predicate. For example, a query such as
    `SELECT * FROM t1 WHERE (SELECT a FROM t2 WHERE
    t2.a=t1.a) > 0` can be rewritten as
    `SELECT t1.* FROM t1 LEFT OUTER JOIN (SELECT a,
    COUNT(*) AS ct FROM t2 GROUP BY a) AS derived ON t1.a =
    derived.a WHERE derived.a > 0`. MySQL
    performs a cardinality check to make sure that the
    subquery does not return more than one row
    ([`ER_SUBQUERY_NO_1_ROW`](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/mysql-errors/8.0/en/server-error-reference.html#error_er_subquery_no_1_row)).
    See [Section 15.2.15.7, “Correlated Subqueries”](correlated-subqueries.md "15.2.15.7 Correlated Subqueries"), for more
    information.

    This optimization is normally disabled, since it does
    not yield a noticeable performance benefit in most
    cases; the flag is set to `off` by
    default.

  For more information, see
  [Section 10.9.2, “Switchable Optimizations”](switchable-optimizations.md "10.9.2 Switchable Optimizations"). See also
  [Section 10.2.1.19, “LIMIT Query Optimization”](limit-optimization.md "10.2.1.19 LIMIT Query Optimization"),
  [Section 10.2.2.1, “Optimizing IN and EXISTS Subquery Predicates with Semijoin
  Transformations”](semijoins.md "10.2.2.1 Optimizing IN and EXISTS Subquery Predicates with Semijoin Transformations"), and
  [Section 10.2.2.4, “Optimizing Derived Tables, View References, and Common Table Expressions
  with Merging or Materialization”](derived-table-optimization.md "10.2.2.4 Optimizing Derived Tables, View References, and Common Table Expressions with Merging or Materialization").
- **XML enhancements.**
  As of MySQL 8.0.21, the [`LOAD
  XML`](load-xml.md "15.2.10 LOAD XML Statement") statement now supports
  `CDATA` sections in the XML to be
  imported.
- **Casting to the YEAR type now supported.**
  Beginning with MySQL 8.0.22, the server allows casting to
  [`YEAR`](year.md "13.2.4 The YEAR Type"). Both the
  [`CAST()`](cast-functions.md#function_cast) and
  [`CONVERT()`](cast-functions.md#function_convert) functions support
  single-digit, two-digit, and four-digit
  `YEAR` values. For one-digit and
  two-digit values, the allowed range is 0-99. Four-digit
  values must be in the range 1901-2155.
  `YEAR` can also be used as the return
  type for the [`JSON_VALUE()`](json-search-functions.md#function_json-value)
  function; this function supports four-digit years only.

  String, time-and-date, and floating-point values can all be
  cast to `YEAR`. Casting of
  [`GEOMETRY`](spatial-type-overview.md "13.4.1 Spatial Data Types") values to
  `YEAR` is not supported.

  For more information, including conversion rules, see the
  description of the [`CONVERT()`](cast-functions.md#function_convert)
  function.
- **Retrieval of TIMESTAMP values as UTC.**
  MySQL 8.0.22 and later supports conversion of a
  [`TIMESTAMP`](datetime.md "13.2.2 The DATE, DATETIME, and TIMESTAMP Types") column value from
  the system time zone to a UTC
  [`DATETIME`](datetime.md "13.2.2 The DATE, DATETIME, and TIMESTAMP Types") on retrieval,
  using `CAST(value AT
  TIME ZONE specifier AS
  DATETIME)`, where the specifier is one of
  `[INTERVAL] '+00:00'` or
  `'UTC'`. The precision of the
  `DATETIME` value returned by the cast can
  be specified up to 6 decimal places, if desired. The
  `ARRAY` keyword is not supported with
  this construct.

  `TIMESTAMP` values inserted into a table
  using a timezone offset are also supported. Use of
  `AT TIME ZONE` is not supported for
  [`CONVERT()`](cast-functions.md#function_convert) or any other MySQL
  function or construct.

  For further information and examples, see the description of
  the [`CAST()`](cast-functions.md#function_cast) function.
- **Dump file output synchronization.**
  MySQL 8.0.22 and later supports periodic synchronization
  when writing to files by
  [`SELECT INTO
  DUMPFILE`](select-into.md "15.2.13.1 SELECT ... INTO Statement") and `SELECT INTO
  OUTFILE` statements. This can be enabled by
  setting the
  [`select_into_disk_sync`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_select_into_disk_sync)
  system variable to `ON`; the size of the
  write buffer is determined by the value set for
  [`select_into_buffer_size`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_select_into_buffer_size);
  the default is 131072 (217)
  bytes.

  In addition, an optional delay following synchronization to
  disk can be set using
  [`select_into_disk_sync_delay`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_select_into_disk_sync_delay);
  the default is no delay (0 milliseconds).

  For more information, see the descriptions of the variables
  referenced previously in this item.
- **Single preparation of statements.**
  As of MySQL 8.0.22, a prepared statement is prepared a
  single time, rather than once each time it is executed.
  This is done when executing
  [`PREPARE`](prepare.md "15.5.1 PREPARE Statement"). This is also true
  for any statement inside a stored procedure; the statement
  is prepared once, when the stored procedure is first
  executed.

  One result of this change is that the fashion in which
  dynamic parameters used in prepared statements are resolved
  is also changed in the ways listed here:

  - A prepared statement parameter is assigned a data type
    when the statement is prepared; the type persists for
    each subsequent execution of the statement (unless the
    statement is reprepared; see following).

    Using a different data type for a given parameter or
    user variable within a prepared statement for executions
    of the statement subsequent to the first execution may
    cause the statement to be reprepared; for this reason,
    it is advisable to use the same data type for a given
    parameter when re-executing a prepared statement.
  - The following constructs employing window functions are
    no longer accepted, in order to align with the SQL
    standard:

    - [`NTILE(NULL)`](window-function-descriptions.md#function_ntile)
    - [`NTH_VALUE(expr,
      NULL)`](window-function-descriptions.md#function_nth-value)
    - [`LEAD(expr,
      nn)`](window-function-descriptions.md#function_lead) and
      [`LAG(expr,
      nn)`](window-function-descriptions.md#function_lag), where
      *`nn`* is a negative number

    This facilitates greater compliance with the SQL
    standard. See the individual function descriptions for
    further details.
  - A user variable referenced within a prepared statement
    now has its data type determined when the statement is
    prepared; the type persists for each subsequent
    execution of the statement.
  - A user variable referenced by a statement occurring
    within a stored procedure now has its data type
    determined the first time the statement is executed; the
    type persists for any subsequent invocation of the
    containing stored procedure.
  - When executing a prepared statement of the form
    `SELECT expr1,
    expr2, ... FROM
    table ORDER BY ?`,
    passing an integer value *`N`*
    for the parameter no longer causes ordering of the
    results by the
    *`N`*th
    expression in the select list; the results are no longer
    ordered, as is expected with `ORDER BY
    constant`.

  Preparing a statement used as a prepared statement or within
  a stored procedure only once enhances the performance of the
  statement, since it negates the added cost of repeated
  preparation. Doing so also avoids possible multiple
  rollbacks of preparation structures, which has been the
  source of numerous issues in MySQL.

  For more information, see [Section 15.5.1, “PREPARE Statement”](prepare.md "15.5.1 PREPARE Statement").
- **RIGHT JOIN as LEFT JOIN handling.**
  As of MySQL 8.0.22, the server handles all instances of
  `RIGHT JOIN` internally as `LEFT
  JOIN`, eliminating a number of special cases in
  which a complete conversion was not performed at parse
  time.
- **Derived condition pushdown optimization.**
  MySQL 8.0.22 (and later) implements derived condition
  pushdown for queries having materialized derived tables.
  For a query such as `SELECT * FROM (SELECT i, j
  FROM t1) AS dt WHERE i >
  constant`, it is now
  possible in many cases to push the outer
  `WHERE` condition down to the derived
  table, in this case resulting in `SELECT * FROM
  (SELECT i, j FROM t1 WHERE i >
  constant) AS dt`.

  Previously, if the derived table was materialized and not
  merged, MySQL materialized the entire table, then qualified
  the rows with the `WHERE` condition. Moving
  the `WHERE` condition into the subquery
  using the derived condition pushdown optimization can often
  reduce the number of rows must be processed, which can
  decrease the time needed to execute the query.

  An outer `WHERE` condition can be pushed
  down directly to a materialized derived table when the
  derived table does not use any aggregate or window
  functions. When the derived table has a `GROUP
  BY` and does not use any window functions, the
  outer `WHERE` condition can be pushed down
  to the derived table as a `HAVING`
  condition. The `WHERE` condition can also
  be pushed down when the derived table uses a window function
  and the outer `WHERE` references columns
  used in the window function's
  `PARTITION` clause.

  Derived condition pushdown is enabled by default, as
  indicated by the
  [`optimizer_switch`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_optimizer_switch) system
  variable's
  [`derived_condition_pushdown`](switchable-optimizations.md#optflag_derived-condition-pushdown)
  flag. The flag, added in MySQL 8.0.22, is set to
  `on` by default; to disable the
  optimization for a specific query, you can use the
  [`NO_DERIVED_CONDITION_PUSHDOWN`](optimizer-hints.md#optimizer-hints-table-level "Table-Level Optimizer Hints")
  optimizer hint (also added in MySQL 8.0.22). If the
  optimization is disabled due to
  [`derived_condition_pushdown`](switchable-optimizations.md#optflag_derived-condition-pushdown)
  being set to `off`, you can enable it for a
  given query using
  [`DERIVED_CONDITION_PUSHDOWN`](optimizer-hints.md#optimizer-hints-table-level "Table-Level Optimizer Hints").

  The derived condition pushdown optimization cannot be
  employed for a derived table that contains a
  `LIMIT` clause. Prior to MySQL 8.0.29, the
  optimization also cannot be used when the query contains
  [`UNION`](union.md "15.2.18 UNION Clause"). In MySQL 8.0.29 and
  later, conditions can be pushed down to both query blocks of
  a union in most cases; see
  [Section 10.2.2.5, “Derived Condition Pushdown Optimization”](derived-condition-pushdown-optimization.md "10.2.2.5 Derived Condition Pushdown Optimization"),
  for more information.

  In addition, a condition that itself uses a subquery cannot
  be pushed down, and a `WHERE` condition
  cannot be pushed down to a derived table that is also an
  inner table of an outer join. For additional information and
  examples, see
  [Section 10.2.2.5, “Derived Condition Pushdown Optimization”](derived-condition-pushdown-optimization.md "10.2.2.5 Derived Condition Pushdown Optimization").
- **Non-locking reads on MySQL grant tables.**
  As of MySQL 8.0.22, to permit concurrent DML and DDL
  operations on MySQL grant tables, read operations that
  previously acquired row locks on MySQL grant tables are
  executed as non-locking reads.

  The operations that are now performed as non-locking reads
  on MySQL grant tables include:

  - [`SELECT`](select.md "15.2.13 SELECT Statement") statements and
    other read-only statements that read data from grant
    tables through join lists and subqueries, including
    [`SELECT
    ... FOR SHARE`](innodb-locking-reads.md "17.7.2.4 Locking Reads") statements, using any
    transaction isolation level.
  - DML operations that read data from grant tables (through
    join lists or subqueries) but do not modify them, using
    any transaction isolation level.

  For additional information, see
  [Grant Table Concurrency](grant-tables.md#grant-tables-concurrency "Grant Table Concurrency").
- **64-bit support for FROM\_UNIXTIME(), UNIX\_TIMESTAMP(), CONVERT\_TZ().**
  As of MySQL 8.0.28, the functions
  [`FROM_UNIXTIME()`](date-and-time-functions.md#function_from-unixtime),
  [`UNIX_TIMESTAMP()`](date-and-time-functions.md#function_unix-timestamp), and
  [`CONVERT_TZ()`](date-and-time-functions.md#function_convert-tz) handle 64-bit
  values on platforms that support them. This includes
  64-bit versions of Linux, MacOS, and Windows.

  On compatible platforms, `UNIX_TIMESTAMP()`
  now handles values up to `'3001-01-18
  23:59:59.999999'` UTC, and
  `FROM_UNIXTIME()` can convert values up to
  32536771199.999999 seconds since the Unix Epoch;
  `CONVERT_TZ()` now accepts values that do
  not exceed `'3001-01-18 23:59:59.999999'`
  UTC following conversion.

  The behavior of these functions on 32-bit platforms is
  unaffected by these changes. The behavior of the
  [`TIMESTAMP`](datetime.md "13.2.2 The DATE, DATETIME, and TIMESTAMP Types") type is also not
  affected (on any platform); for working with datetimes after
  `'2038-01-19 03:14:07.999999'`, UTC, use
  the [`DATETIME`](datetime.md "13.2.2 The DATE, DATETIME, and TIMESTAMP Types") type instead.

  For more information, see the descriptions of the individual
  functions just discussed, in
  [Section 14.7, “Date and Time Functions”](date-and-time-functions.md "14.7 Date and Time Functions").
- **Resource allocation control.**
  Beginning with MySQL 8.0.28, you can see the amount of
  memory used for queries issued by all regular users by
  checking the
  [`Global_connection_memory`](server-status-variables.md#statvar_Global_connection_memory)
  status variable. (This total does not include resources
  used by system users such as MySQL root. It is also
  exclusive of any memory taken by the
  [`InnoDB`](innodb-storage-engine.md "Chapter 17 The InnoDB Storage Engine") buffer pool.)

  To enable updates of
  `Global_connection_memory`, it is necessary
  to set
  [`global_connection_memory_tracking =
  1`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_global_connection_memory_tracking); this is `0` (off) by default.
  You can control how often
  `Global_connection_memory` is updated by
  setting
  [`connection_memory_chunk_size`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_connection_memory_chunk_size).

  It is also possible to set memory usage limits for normal
  users on the session or global level, or both, by setting
  either or both of the system variables listed here:

  - [`connection_memory_limit`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_connection_memory_limit):
    Amount of memory allocated for each connection. Whenever
    this limit is exceeded for any user, new queries from
    this user are rejected.
  - [`global_connection_memory_limit`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_global_connection_memory_limit):
    Amount of memory allocated for all connections. Whenever
    this limit is exceeded, new queries from any regular
    user are rejected.

  These limits do not apply to system processes or
  administrative accounts.

  See the descriptions of the referenced variables for more
  information.
- **Detached XA transactions.**
  MySQL 8.0.29 adds support for XA transactions which, once
  prepared, are no longer connected to the originating
  connection. This means that they can be committed or
  rolled back by another connection, and that the current
  session can immediately begin another transaction.

  A system variable
  [`xa_detach_on_prepare`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_xa_detach_on_prepare)
  controls whether XA transaction are detached; the default is
  `ON`, which causes all XA transactions to
  be detached. Use of temporary tables is disallowed for XA
  transactions when this is in effect.

  For more information, see [Section 15.3.8.2, “XA Transaction States”](xa-states.md "15.3.8.2 XA Transaction States").
- **Automatic binary log purge control.**
  MySQL 8.0.29 adds the
  [`binlog_expire_logs_auto_purge`](replication-options-binary-log.md#sysvar_binlog_expire_logs_auto_purge)
  system variable, which provides a single interface for
  enabling and disabling automatic purging of the binary
  logs. This is enabled (`ON`) by default;
  to disable automatic purging of the binary log files, set
  this variable to `OFF`.

  `binlog_expire_logs_auto_purge` must be
  `ON` in order for automatic purging of the
  binary log files to proceed; the value of this variable
  takes precedence over that of any other server option or
  variable, including (but not exclusive to)
  [`binlog_expire_logs_seconds`](replication-options-binary-log.md#sysvar_binlog_expire_logs_seconds).

  The setting for
  `binlog_expire_logs_auto_purge` has no
  effect on [`PURGE BINARY LOGS`](purge-binary-logs.md "15.4.1.1 PURGE BINARY LOGS Statement").
- **Conditional routine and trigger creation statements.**
  Beginning with MySQL 8.0.29, the following statements
  support an `IF NOT EXISTS` option:

  - [`CREATE FUNCTION`](create-function.md "15.1.14 CREATE FUNCTION Statement")
  - [`CREATE PROCEDURE`](create-procedure.md "15.1.17 CREATE PROCEDURE and CREATE FUNCTION Statements")
  - [`CREATE TRIGGER`](create-trigger.md "15.1.22 CREATE TRIGGER Statement")

  For `CREATE FUNCTION` when creating a
  stored function and `CREATE PROCEDURE`,
  this option prevents an error from occurring if there is
  already a routine having the same name. For
  [`CREATE
  FUNCTION`](create-function-loadable.md "15.7.4.1 CREATE FUNCTION Statement for Loadable Functions") when used to create a loadable function,
  the option prevents an error if there already exists a
  loadable function having that name. For `CREATE
  TRIGGER`, the option prevents an error from
  occurring if there already exists in the same schema and on
  the same table a trigger having the same name.

  This enhancement aligns the syntax of these statements more
  closely with that of [`CREATE
  DATABASE`](create-database.md "15.1.12 CREATE DATABASE Statement"), [`CREATE
  TABLE`](create-table.md "15.1.20 CREATE TABLE Statement"), [`CREATE USER`](create-user.md "15.7.1.3 CREATE USER Statement"),
  and [`CREATE EVENT`](create-event.md "15.1.13 CREATE EVENT Statement") (all of
  which already support `IF NOT EXISTS`), and
  acts to complement the `IF EXISTS` option
  supported by [`DROP PROCEDURE`](drop-procedure.md "15.1.29 DROP PROCEDURE and DROP FUNCTION Statements"),
  [`DROP FUNCTION`](drop-function.md "15.1.26 DROP FUNCTION Statement"), and
  [`DROP TRIGGER`](drop-trigger.md "15.1.34 DROP TRIGGER Statement") statements.

  For more information, see the descriptions of the indicated
  SQL statements, as well as
  [Function Name Resolution](function-resolution.md#function-name-resolution "Function Name Resolution"). See also
  [Section 19.5.1.7, “Replication of CREATE TABLE ... SELECT Statements”](replication-features-create-select.md "19.5.1.7 Replication of CREATE TABLE ... SELECT Statements").
- **Included FIDO library upgrade.**
  MySQL 8.0.30 upgrades the included
  `fido2` library (used with the
  `authentication_fido` plugin) from
  version 1.5.0 to version 1.8.0.

  See [Section 8.4.1.11, “FIDO Pluggable Authentication”](fido-pluggable-authentication.md "8.4.1.11 FIDO Pluggable Authentication"), for
  more information.
- **Character sets: Language-specific collations.**
  Previously, when more than one language had the exact same
  collation definition, MySQL implemented collations for
  only one of the languages, which meant that some languages
  were covered only by `utf8mb4` Unicode
  9.0 collations specific to other languages. MySQL 8.0.30
  (and later) fixes such issues by providing
  language-specific collations for those languages that were
  previously covered only by language-specific collations
  for other languages. Languages covered by the new
  collations are listed here:

  - Norwegian (Nynorsk)

    and

    Norwegian (Bokmål)
  - Serbian (Latin characters)
  - Bosnian (Latin characters)
  - Bulgarian
  - Galician
  - Mongolian (Cyrillic characters)

  MySQL provides `*_as_cs` and
  `*_ai_ci` collations for each of the
  languages just listed.

  For more information, see
  [Language-Specific Collations](charset-unicode-sets.md#charset-unicode-sets-language-specific-collations "Language-Specific Collations").
- **IF EXISTS and IGNORE UNKNOWN USER options for REVOKE.**
  MySQL 8.0.30 implements two new options for
  [`REVOKE`](revoke.md "15.7.1.8 REVOKE Statement") which can be used to
  determine whether a statement yields an error or a warning
  when a user, role, or privilege specified in the statement
  cannot be found, or cannot be assigned. Very basic syntax
  showing the placement of these new options is provided
  here:

  ```sql
  REVOKE [IF EXISTS] privilege_or_role
      ON object
      FROM user_or_role [IGNORE UNKNOWN USER]
  ```

  `IF EXISTS` causes an unsuccessful
  `REVOKE` statement to raise a warning
  instead of an error, as long as the named target user or
  role actually exists, despite any references in the
  statement to any roles or privileges which cannot be found.

  `IGNORE UNKNOWN USER` causes an
  unsuccessful *`REVOKE`* to raise a
  warning rather than an error when the target user or role
  named in the statement cannot be found.

  For further information and examples, see
  [Section 15.7.1.8, “REVOKE Statement”](revoke.md "15.7.1.8 REVOKE Statement").
- **Generated invisible primary keys.**
  Beginning with MySQL 8.0.30, it is possible to run a
  replication source server such that a generated invisible
  primary key (GIPK) is added to any
  [`InnoDB`](innodb-storage-engine.md "Chapter 17 The InnoDB Storage Engine") table that is created
  without an explicit primary key. The generated key column
  definition added to such a table is equivalent to what is
  shown here:

  ```sql
  my_row_id BIGINT UNSIGNED NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT INVISIBLE PRIMARY KEY
  ```

  GIPK mode is not enabled by default. To enable it, set the
  [`sql_generate_invisible_primary_key`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_sql_generate_invisible_primary_key)
  server system variable to `ON`.

  Generated invisible primary keys are normally visible in the
  output of statements such as [`SHOW
  CREATE TABLE`](show-create-table.md "15.7.7.10 SHOW CREATE TABLE Statement") and [`SHOW
  INDEX`](show-index.md "15.7.7.22 SHOW INDEX Statement"), as well as in MySQL Information Schema
  tables such as the [`COLUMNS`](information-schema-columns-table.md "28.3.8 The INFORMATION_SCHEMA COLUMNS Table") and
  [`STATISTICS`](information-schema-statistics-table.md "28.3.34 The INFORMATION_SCHEMA STATISTICS Table") tables. You can
  cause them to be hidden in such cases instead, by setting
  [`show_gipk_in_create_table_and_information_schema`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_show_gipk_in_create_table_and_information_schema)
  to `OFF`.

  As part of this work, a new
  `--skip-generated-invisible-primary-key`
  option is added to [**mysqldump**](mysqldump.md "6.5.4 mysqldump — A Database Backup Program") and
  [**mysqlpump**](mysqlpump.md "6.5.6 mysqlpump — A Database Backup Program") to exclude generated invisible
  primary keys, columns, and column values from their output.

  **GIPKs and replication between tables with or without primary keys.**
  In MySQL Replication, a replica effectively ignores any
  setting for
  [`sql_generate_invisible_primary_key`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_sql_generate_invisible_primary_key)
  on the source, such that it has no effect on replicated
  tables. MySQL 8.0.32 and later makes it possible for the
  replica to add a generated invisible primary key to any
  [`InnoDB`](innodb-storage-engine.md "Chapter 17 The InnoDB Storage Engine") table that otherwise,
  as replicated, has no primary key. You can do this by
  invoking
  [`CHANGE
  REPLICATION SOURCE TO ... REQUIRE_TABLE_PRIMARY_KEY_CHECK
  = GENERATE`](change-replication-source-to.md "15.4.2.3 CHANGE REPLICATION SOURCE TO Statement") on the replica.

  `REQUIRE_TABLE_PRIMARY_KEY_CHECK =
  GENERATE` is not compatible with MySQL Group
  Replication.

  For further information, see
  [Section 15.1.20.11, “Generated Invisible Primary Keys”](create-table-gipks.md "15.1.20.11 Generated Invisible Primary Keys").
- **Crash-safe XA transactions.**
  Previously, XA transactions were not fully resilient to an
  unexpected halt with respect to the binary log, and if
  this occurred while the server was executing
  [`XA
  PREPARE`](xa-statements.md "15.3.8.1 XA Transaction SQL Statements"), `XA COMMIT`, or
  `XA ROLLBACK`, the server was not
  guaranteed to be recoverable to the correct state,
  possibly leaving the binary log with extra XA transactions
  that had not been applied, or missing one or more XA
  transactions that had been applied. Beginning with MySQL
  8.0.30, this is no longer an issue, and a server that
  drops out of a replication topology for whatever reason
  can always be brought back to a consistent XA transaction
  state when rejoining.

  *Known issue*: When the same transaction
  XID is used to execute XA transactions sequentially and a
  break occurs during the execution of `XA COMMIT ...
  ONE PHASE`, using this same XID, after this
  transaction has been prepared in the storage engine, it may
  not be possible any longer to synchronize the state between
  the binary log and the storage engine.

  For more information, see [Section 15.3.8.3, “Restrictions on XA Transactions”](xa-restrictions.md "15.3.8.3 Restrictions on XA Transactions").
- **Nesting with UNION.**
  Beginning with MySQL 8.0.31, bodies of parenthesized query
  expressions can be nested up to 63 levels deep in
  combination with [`UNION`](union.md "15.2.18 UNION Clause").
  Such queries were previously rejected with error
  [`ER_NOT_SUPPORTED_YET`](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/mysql-errors/8.0/en/server-error-reference.html#error_er_not_supported_yet), but
  are now allowed. [`EXPLAIN`](explain.md "15.8.2 EXPLAIN Statement")
  output for such a query is shown here:

  ```sql
  mysql> EXPLAIN FORMAT=TREE (
      ->   (SELECT a, b, c FROM t ORDER BY a LIMIT 3) ORDER BY b LIMIT 2
      -> ) ORDER BY c LIMIT 1\G
  *************************** 1. row ***************************
  EXPLAIN: -> Limit: 1 row(s)  (cost=5.55..5.55 rows=1)
      -> Sort: c, limit input to 1 row(s) per chunk  (cost=2.50 rows=0)
          -> Table scan on <result temporary>  (cost=2.50 rows=0)
              -> Temporary table  (cost=5.55..5.55 rows=1)
                  -> Limit: 2 row(s)  (cost=2.95..2.95 rows=1)
                      -> Sort: b, limit input to 2 row(s) per chunk  (cost=2.50 rows=0)
                          -> Table scan on <result temporary>  (cost=2.50 rows=0)
                              -> Temporary table  (cost=2.95..2.95 rows=1)
                                  -> Limit: 3 row(s)  (cost=0.35 rows=1)
                                      -> Sort: t.a, limit input to 3 row(s) per chunk  (cost=0.35 rows=1)
                                          -> Table scan on t  (cost=0.35 rows=1)

  1 row in set (0.00 sec)
  ```

  MySQL follows SQL standard semantics when collapsing bodies
  of parenthesized query expressions, so that a higher outer
  limit cannot override an inner lower one. For example,
  `(SELECT ... LIMIT 5) LIMIT 10` can return
  no more than five rows.

  The 63-level limit is imposed only after the MySQL
  Optimizer's parser has performed any simplifications or
  merges which it can.

  For more information, see
  [Section 15.2.11, “Parenthesized Query Expressions”](parenthesized-query-expressions.md "15.2.11 Parenthesized Query Expressions").
- **Disabling query rewrites.**
  Previously, when using the `Rewriter`
  plugin, all queries were subject to being rewritten,
  regardless of user. This could be problematic in certain
  cases, such as when administering the system, or when
  applying statements originating from a replication source
  or a dump file created by [**mysqldump**](mysqldump.md "6.5.4 mysqldump — A Database Backup Program") or
  another MySQL program. MySQL 8.0.31 provides a solution to
  such issues by implementing a new user privilege
  [`SKIP_QUERY_REWRITE`](privileges-provided.md#priv_skip-query-rewrite);
  statements issued by a user having this privilege are
  ignored by `Rewriter` and not rewritten.

  MySQL 8.0.31 also adds a new server system variable
  [`rewriter_enabled_for_threads_without_privilege_checks`](rewriter-query-rewrite-plugin-reference.md#sysvar_rewriter_enabled_for_threads_without_privilege_checks).
  When set to `OFF`, rewritable statements
  issued by threads for which
  `PRIVILEGE_CHECKS_USER` is
  `NULL` (such as replication applier
  threads) are not rewritten by the
  `Rewriter` plugin. The default is
  `ON`, which means such statements are
  rewritten.

  For more information, see
  [Section 7.6.4, “The Rewriter Query Rewrite Plugin”](rewriter-query-rewrite-plugin.md "7.6.4 The Rewriter Query Rewrite Plugin").
- **Replication filtering of XA statements.**
  Previously, the statements
  [`XA
  START`](xa-statements.md "15.3.8.1 XA Transaction SQL Statements"), `XA END`, `XA
  COMMIT`, and `XA ROLLBACK` were
  filtered by the default database whenever using
  [`--replicate-do-db`](replication-options-replica.md#option_mysqld_replicate-do-db) or
  [`--replicate-ignore-db`](replication-options-replica.md#option_mysqld_replicate-ignore-db),
  which could lead to missed transactions. As of MySQL
  8.0.31, these statements are not filtered in such cases,
  regardless of the value of
  [`binlog_format`](replication-options-binary-log.md#sysvar_binlog_format).
- **Replication filtering and privilege checks.**
  Beginning with MySQL 8.0.31, when replication filtering is
  in use, a replica no longer raises replication errors
  related to privilege checks or
  [`require_row_format`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_require_row_format)
  validation for events which are filtered out, making it
  possible to filter out any transactions that fail
  validation.

  Because privilege checks on filtered rows can no longer
  cause replication to stop, a replica can now accept only the
  portion of a database to which a given user has been granted
  access; this is true as long as updates to this part of the
  database are replicated only in row-based format.

  This capability may also be of use when migrating to MySQL HeatWave Service
  from an on-premise or cloud service which uses tables for
  administration or other purposes to which the inbound
  replication user does not have access.

  For more information, see
  [Section 19.2.5, “How Servers Evaluate Replication Filtering Rules”](replication-rules.md "19.2.5 How Servers Evaluate Replication Filtering Rules"), as well as
  [Section 19.5.1.29, “Replica Errors During Replication”](replication-features-errors.md "19.5.1.29 Replica Errors During Replication").
- **INTERSECT and EXCEPT table operators.**
  MySQL 8.0.31 adds support for the SQL
  [`INTERSECT`](intersect.md "15.2.8 INTERSECT Clause") and
  [`EXCEPT`](except.md "15.2.4 EXCEPT Clause") table operators.
  Where *`a`* and
  *`b`* represent result sets of
  queries, these operators behave as follows:

  - `a INTERSECT
    b` includes only
    rows appearing in both result sets
    *`a`* and
    *`b`*.
  - `a EXCEPT
    b` returns only
    those rows from result set *`a`*
    which do *not* also appear in
    *`b`*.

  `INTERSECT DISTINCT`, `INTERSECT
  ALL`, `EXCEPT DISTINCT`, and
  `EXCEPT ALL` are all supported;
  `DISTINCT` is the default for both
  `INTERSECT` and `EXCEPT`
  (this is the same as for
  [`UNION`](union.md "15.2.18 UNION Clause")).

  For more information and examples, see
  [Section 15.2.8, “INTERSECT Clause”](intersect.md "15.2.8 INTERSECT Clause"), and [Section 15.2.4, “EXCEPT Clause”](except.md "15.2.4 EXCEPT Clause").
- **User-defined histograms.**
  Beginning with MySQL 8.0.31, it is possible to set the
  histogram of a column to a user-specified JSON value. This
  can be done using the following SQL syntax:

  ```sql
  ANALYZE TABLE tbl_name
    UPDATE HISTOGRAM ON col_name
    USING DATA 'json_data'
  ```

  This statement creates or overwrites a histogram for column
  *`col_name`* of table
  *`tbl_name`* using the
  histogram's JSON representation
  *`json_data`*. After executing this
  statement, you can verify that the histogram was created or
  updated by querying the Information Schema
  [`COLUMN_STATISTICS`](information-schema-column-statistics-table.md "28.3.11 The INFORMATION_SCHEMA COLUMN_STATISTICS Table") table, like
  this:

  ```sql
  SELECT HISTOGRAM FROM INFORMATION_SCHEMA.COLUMN_STATISTICS
    WHERE TABLE_NAME='tbl_name'
    AND COLUMN_NAME='col_name';
  ```

  The column value returned should be the same
  *`json_data`* used in the previous
  `ANALYZE TABLE` statement.

  This can be of use in cases where values deemed important
  are missed by the histogram sampling process. When this
  happens, you may want to modify the histogram or set your
  own histogram based on the complete data set. In addition,
  sampling a large user data set and building a histogram from
  it are resource-heavy operations which can impact user
  queries. With this enhancement, histogram generation can be
  moved off the (primary) server and performed on a replica
  instead; the generated histograms can then be assigned to
  the proper table columns on the source server.

  For more information and examples, see
  [Histogram Statistics Analysis](analyze-table.md#analyze-table-histogram-statistics-analysis "Histogram Statistics Analysis").
- **Server build ID (Linux).**
  MySQL 8.0.31 adds the read-only
  [`build_id`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_build_id) system variable
  for Linux systems, where a 160-bit `SHA1`
  signature is generated at compile time; the value of
  `build_id` is that of the generated value
  converted to a hexadecimal string, providing a unique
  identifier for the build.

  `build_id` is written to the server log
  each time MySQL starts.

  If you build MySQL from source, you can observe that this
  value changes each time you recompile the server. See
  [Section 2.8, “Installing MySQL from Source”](source-installation.md "2.8 Installing MySQL from Source"), for more information.

  This variable is not supported on platforms other than
  Linux.
- **Default EXPLAIN output format.**
  MySQL 8.0.32 adds a system variable
  [`explain_format`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_explain_format) which
  determines the format of the output from an
  [`EXPLAIN`](explain.md#explain-execution-plan "Obtaining Execution Plan Information")
  statement used to obtain a query execution plan in the
  absence of any `FORMAT` option. For
  example, if the value of `explain_format`
  is `TREE`, then the output from any such
  `EXPLAIN` uses the tree-like format, just
  as if the statement had specified
  `FORMAT=TREE`.

  This behavior is overridden by the value set in a
  `FORMAT` option. Suppose that
  *`explain_format`* is set to
  *`TREE`*; even so, `EXPLAIN
  FORMAT=JSON stmt`
  displays the result using the JSON output format.

  For more information and examples, see the description of
  the [`explain_format`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_explain_format) system
  variable, as well as
  [Obtaining Execution Plan Information](explain.md#explain-execution-plan "Obtaining Execution Plan Information"). There are also
  implications for the behavior of `EXPLAIN
  ANALYZE`; see [Obtaining Information with EXPLAIN ANALYZE](explain.md#explain-analyze "Obtaining Information with EXPLAIN ANALYZE").
- **ST\_TRANSFORM() Cartesian SRS support.**
  Prior to MySQL 8.0.30, the
  [`ST_TRANSFORM()`](spatial-operator-functions.md#function_st-transform) function did
  not support Cartesian Spatial Reference Systems. In MySQL
  8.0.30 and later, this function provides support for the
  Popular Visualisation Pseudo Mercator (EPSG 1024)
  projection method, used for WGS 84 Pseudo-Mercator (SRID
  3857). MySQL 8.0.32 and later supports all Cartesian SRSs,
  except for EPSG 1042, EPSG 1043, EPSG 9816, and EPSG 9826.
- **mysql client --system-command option.**
  The [`--system-command`](mysql-command-options.md#option_mysql_system-command) option
  for the [**mysql**](mysql.md "6.5.1 mysql — The MySQL Command-Line Client") client, available in
  MySQL 8.0.40 and later, enables or disables the
  `system` command.

  This option is enabled by default. To disable it, use
  [`--system-command=OFF`](mysql-command-options.md#option_mysql_system-command) or
  [`--skip-system-command`](mysql-command-options.md#option_mysql_skip-system-command), which
  causes the `system` command to be rejected
  with an error.
- **mysql client --commands option.**
  The [**mysql**](mysql.md "6.5.1 mysql — The MySQL Command-Line Client") client
  [`--commands`](mysql-command-options.md#option_mysql_commands) option,
  introduced in MySQL 8.0.43, enables or disables most
  [**mysql**](mysql.md "6.5.1 mysql — The MySQL Command-Line Client") client commands.

  This option is enabled by default. To disable it, start the
  [**mysql**](mysql.md "6.5.1 mysql — The MySQL Command-Line Client") client with
  [`--commands=OFF`](mysql-command-options.md#option_mysql_commands) or
  [`--skip-commands`](mysql-command-options.md#option_mysql_commands).

  For more information, see
  [Section 6.5.1.1, “mysql Client Options”](mysql-command-options.md "6.5.1.1 mysql Client Options").

### Features Deprecated in MySQL 8.0

The following features are deprecated in MySQL 8.0
and may be removed in a future series. Where alternatives are
shown, applications should be updated to use them.

For applications that use features deprecated in MySQL
8.0 that have been removed in a higher MySQL
series, statements may fail when replicated from a MySQL
8.0 source to a higher-series replica, or may have
different effects on source and replica. To avoid such problems,
applications that use features deprecated in 8.0
should be revised to avoid them and use alternatives when
possible.

- **Wildcard characters in database grants.**
  The use of the characters `%` and
  `_` as wildcards in database grants is
  deprecated as of MySQL 8.0.35. You should expect for the
  wildcard functionality to removed in a future MySQL
  release and for these characters always to be treated as
  literals, as they are already whenever the value of the
  [`partial_revokes`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_partial_revokes) server
  system variable is `ON`.

  In addition, the treatment of `%` by the
  server as a synonym for `localhost` when
  checking privileges is now also deprecated as of MySQL
  8.0.35, and thus subject to removal in a future version of
  MySQL.
- Pluggable FIDO authentication is deprecated in MySQL 8.0.35
  and later.
- The
  [`--character-set-client-handshake`](server-options.md#option_mysqld_character-set-client-handshake)
  option, originally intended for use with upgrades from very
  old versions of MySQL, is now deprecated in MySQL 8.0.35 and
  later MySQL 8.0 releases, where a warning is issued whenever
  it is used. You should expect this option to be removed in a
  future version of MySQL; applications depending on this
  option should begin migration away from it as soon as
  possible.
- The [`old`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_old) and
  [`new`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_new) server system variables
  and related server options are deprecated in MySQL 8.0,
  beginning with MySQL 8.0.35. A warning is now issued
  whenever either of these variables is set or read. Because
  these variables are destined for removal in a future version
  of MySQL, applications which depend on them should begin
  migration away from them as soon as possible.
- Legacy audit log filtering mode is deprecated as of MySQL
  8.0.34. New deprecation warnings are emitted for legacy
  audit log filtering system variables. These deprecated
  variables are either read-only or dynamic.

  (Read-only)
  [`audit_log_policy`](audit-log-reference.md#sysvar_audit_log_policy) now writes
  a warning message to the MySQL server error log during
  server startup when the value is not `ALL`
  (default value).

  (Dynamic)
  [`audit_log_include_accounts`](audit-log-reference.md#sysvar_audit_log_include_accounts),
  [`audit_log_exclude_accounts`](audit-log-reference.md#sysvar_audit_log_exclude_accounts),
  [`audit_log_statement_policy`](audit-log-reference.md#sysvar_audit_log_statement_policy),
  and
  [`audit_log_connection_policy`](audit-log-reference.md#sysvar_audit_log_connection_policy).
  Dynamic variables print a warning message based on usage:

  - Passing in a non-NULL value to
    [`audit_log_include_accounts`](audit-log-reference.md#sysvar_audit_log_include_accounts)
    or
    [`audit_log_exclude_accounts`](audit-log-reference.md#sysvar_audit_log_exclude_accounts)
    during MySQL server startup now writes a warning message
    to the server error log.
  - Passing in a non-default value to
    [`audit_log_statement_policy`](audit-log-reference.md#sysvar_audit_log_statement_policy)
    or
    [`audit_log_connection_policy`](audit-log-reference.md#sysvar_audit_log_connection_policy)
    during MySQL server startup now writes a warning message
    to the server error log. `ALL` is the
    default value for both variables.
  - Changing an existing value using
    [`SET`](set.md "13.3.6 The SET Type") syntax during a MySQL
    client session now writes a warning message to the
    client log.
  - Persisting a variable using
    [`SET
    PERSIST`](set-variable.md "15.7.6.1 SET Syntax for Variable Assignment") syntax during a MySQL client session
    now writes a warning message to the client log.
- In MySQL 8.0.34 and later, the
  `mysql_native_password` authentication
  plugin is deprecated and it now produces a deprecation
  warning in the server error log if an account attempts to
  authenticate using `mysql_native_password`
  as an authentication method.
- The [`ssl_fips_mode`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_ssl_fips_mode) server
  system variable,
  [`--ssl-fips-mode`](connection-options.md#option_general_ssl-fips-mode) client
  option, and the `MYSQL_OPT_SSL_FIPS_MODE`
  option are deprecated and subject to removal in a future
  version of MySQL.
- The `keyring_file` and
  `keyring_encrypted_file` plugins are
  deprecated as of MySQL 8.0.34. These keyring plugins are
  superseded by the `component_keyring_file`
  and `component_keyring_encrypted_file`
  components. For a concise comparison of keyring components
  and plugins, see
  [Section 8.4.4.1, “Keyring Components Versus Keyring Plugins”](keyring-component-plugin-comparison.md "8.4.4.1 Keyring Components Versus Keyring Plugins").
- As of MySQL 8.0.31, the `keyring_oci`
  plugin is deprecated and subject to removal in a future
  release of MySQL. Instead, consider using the
  `component_keyring_oci` component for
  storing keyring data (see
  [Section 8.4.4.11, “Using the Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Vault Keyring Component”](keyring-oci-component.md "8.4.4.11 Using the Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Vault Keyring Component")).
- The `utf8mb3` character set is deprecated.
  Please use `utf8mb4` instead.
- The following character sets are deprecated:

  - `ucs2` (see
    [Section 12.9.4, “The ucs2 Character Set (UCS-2 Unicode Encoding)”](charset-unicode-ucs2.md "12.9.4 The ucs2 Character Set (UCS-2 Unicode Encoding)"))
  - `macroman` and `macce`
    (see [Section 12.10.2, “West European Character Sets”](charset-we-sets.md "12.10.2 West European Character Sets"), and
    [Section 12.10.3, “Central European Character Sets”](charset-ce-sets.md "12.10.3 Central European Character Sets"))
  - `dec` (see
    [Section 12.10.2, “West European Character Sets”](charset-we-sets.md "12.10.2 West European Character Sets"))
  - `hp8` (see
    [Section 12.10.2, “West European Character Sets”](charset-we-sets.md "12.10.2 West European Character Sets"))

  In MySQL 8.0.28 and later, any of these character sets or
  their collations produces a deprecation warning when used in
  either of the following ways:

  - When starting the MySQL server with
    [`--character-set-server`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_character_set_server) or
    [`--collation-server`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_collation_server)
  - When specified in any SQL statement, including but not
    limited to [`CREATE TABLE`](create-table.md "15.1.20 CREATE TABLE Statement"),
    [`CREATE DATABASE`](create-database.md "15.1.12 CREATE DATABASE Statement"),
    [`SET NAMES`](set-names.md "15.7.6.3 SET NAMES Statement"), and
    [`ALTER TABLE`](alter-table.md "15.1.9 ALTER TABLE Statement")

  You should use `utf8mb4` instead any of the
  character sets listed previously.

  User-defined collations are deprecated. Beginning with MySQL
  8.0.33, either of the following causes a warning to be
  written to the log:

  - Use of `COLLATE` in any SQL statement
    together with the name of a user-defined collation
  - Using the name of a user-defined collation for the value
    of [`collation_server`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_collation_server),
    [`collation_database`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_collation_database), or
    [`collation_connection`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_collation_connection).

  You should expect support for user-defined collations to be
  removed in a future version of MySQL.
- Because `caching_sha2_password` is the
  default authentication plugin in MySQL 8.0 and provides a
  superset of the capabilities of the
  `sha256_password` authentication plugin,
  `sha256_password` is deprecated; expect it
  to be removed in a future version of MySQL. MySQL accounts
  that authenticate using `sha256_password`
  should be migrated to use
  `caching_sha2_password` instead.
- The `validate_password` plugin has been
  reimplemented to use the component infrastructure. The
  plugin form of `validate_password` is still
  available but is now deprecated; expect it to be removed in
  a future version of MySQL. MySQL installations that use the
  plugin should make the transition to using the component
  instead. See
  [Section 8.4.3.3, “Transitioning to the Password Validation Component”](validate-password-transitioning.md "8.4.3.3 Transitioning to the Password Validation Component").
- The `ENGINE` clause for the
  [`ALTER TABLESPACE`](alter-tablespace.md "15.1.10 ALTER TABLESPACE Statement") and
  [`DROP TABLESPACE`](drop-tablespace.md "15.1.33 DROP TABLESPACE Statement") statements is
  deprecated.
- The
  [`PAD_CHAR_TO_FULL_LENGTH`](sql-mode.md#sqlmode_pad_char_to_full_length)
  SQL mode is deprecated.
- `AUTO_INCREMENT` support is deprecated for
  columns of type [`FLOAT`](floating-point-types.md "13.1.4 Floating-Point Types (Approximate Value) - FLOAT, DOUBLE") and
  [`DOUBLE`](floating-point-types.md "13.1.4 Floating-Point Types (Approximate Value) - FLOAT, DOUBLE") (and any synonyms).
  Consider removing the `AUTO_INCREMENT`
  attribute from such columns, or convert them to an integer
  type.
- The `UNSIGNED` attribute is deprecated for
  columns of type [`FLOAT`](floating-point-types.md "13.1.4 Floating-Point Types (Approximate Value) - FLOAT, DOUBLE"),
  [`DOUBLE`](floating-point-types.md "13.1.4 Floating-Point Types (Approximate Value) - FLOAT, DOUBLE"), and
  [`DECIMAL`](fixed-point-types.md "13.1.3 Fixed-Point Types (Exact Value) - DECIMAL, NUMERIC") (and any synonyms).
  Consider using a simple `CHECK` constraint
  instead for such columns.
- `FLOAT(M,D)`
  and
  `DOUBLE(M,D)`
  syntax to specify the number of digits for columns of type
  [`FLOAT`](floating-point-types.md "13.1.4 Floating-Point Types (Approximate Value) - FLOAT, DOUBLE") and
  [`DOUBLE`](floating-point-types.md "13.1.4 Floating-Point Types (Approximate Value) - FLOAT, DOUBLE") (and any synonyms) is
  a nonstandard MySQL extension. This syntax is deprecated.
- The `ZEROFILL` attribute is deprecated for
  numeric data types, as is the display width attribute for
  integer data types. Consider using an alternative means of
  producing the effect of these attributes. For example,
  applications could use the
  [`LPAD()`](string-functions.md#function_lpad) function to zero-pad
  numbers up to the desired width, or they could store the
  formatted numbers in [`CHAR`](char.md "13.3.2 The CHAR and VARCHAR Types")
  columns.
- For string data types, the `BINARY`
  attribute is a nonstandard MySQL extension that is shorthand
  for specifying the binary (`_bin`)
  collation of the column character set (or of the table
  default character set if no column character set is
  specified). In MySQL 8.0, this nonstandard use of
  `BINARY` is ambiguous because the
  `utf8mb4` character set has multiple
  `_bin` collations, so the
  `BINARY` attribute is deprecated; expect
  support for it to be removed in a future version of MySQL.
  Applications should be adjusted to use an explicit
  `_bin` collation instead.

  The use of `BINARY` to specify a data type
  or character set remains unchanged.
- Previous versions of MySQL supported the nonstandard
  shorthand expressions `ASCII` and
  `UNICODE`, respectively, for
  `CHARACTER SET latin1` and
  `CHARACTER SET ucs2`.
  `ASCII` and `UNICODE` are
  deprecated (MySQL 8.0.28 and later) and now produce a
  warning. Use `CHARACTER SET` instead, in
  both cases.
- The nonstandard C-style
  [`&&`](logical-operators.md#operator_and),
  [`||`](logical-operators.md#operator_or), and
  [`!`](logical-operators.md#operator_not) operators
  that are synonyms for the standard SQL
  [`AND`](logical-operators.md#operator_and),
  [`OR`](logical-operators.md#operator_or), and
  [`NOT`](logical-operators.md#operator_not) operators, respectively,
  are deprecated. Applications that use the nonstandard
  operators should be adjusted to use the standard operators.

  Note

  Use of [`||`](logical-operators.md#operator_or) is
  deprecated unless the
  [`PIPES_AS_CONCAT`](sql-mode.md#sqlmode_pipes_as_concat) SQL mode
  is enabled. In that case, `||` signifies
  the SQL-standard string concatenation operator).
- The [`JSON_MERGE()`](json-modification-functions.md#function_json-merge) function is
  deprecated. Use
  [`JSON_MERGE_PRESERVE()`](json-modification-functions.md#function_json-merge-preserve)
  instead.
- The `SQL_CALC_FOUND_ROWS` query modifier
  and accompanying [`FOUND_ROWS()`](information-functions.md#function_found-rows)
  function are deprecated. See the
  [`FOUND_ROWS()`](information-functions.md#function_found-rows) description for
  information about an alternative strategy.
- Support for `TABLESPACE =
  innodb_file_per_table` and `TABLESPACE =
  innodb_temporary` clauses with
  [`CREATE
  TEMPORARY TABLE`](create-table.md "15.1.20 CREATE TABLE Statement") is deprecated as of MySQL 8.0.13.
- For [`SELECT`](select.md "15.2.13 SELECT Statement") statements, use of
  an `INTO` clause after
  `FROM` but not at the end of the
  [`SELECT`](select.md "15.2.13 SELECT Statement") is deprecated as of
  MySQL 8.0.20. It is preferred to place the
  `INTO` at the end of the statement.

  For [`UNION`](union.md "15.2.18 UNION Clause") statements, these
  two variants containing `INTO` are
  deprecated as of MySQL 8.0.20:

  - In the trailing query block of a query expression, use
    of `INTO` before
    `FROM`.
  - In a parenthesized trailing block of a query expression,
    use of `INTO`, regardless of its
    position relative to `FROM`.

  See [Section 15.2.13.1, “SELECT ... INTO Statement”](select-into.md "15.2.13.1 SELECT ... INTO Statement"), and
  [Section 15.2.18, “UNION Clause”](union.md "15.2.18 UNION Clause").
- [`FLUSH HOSTS`](flush.md#flush-hosts) is deprecated as
  of MySQL 8.0.23. Instead, truncate the Performance Schema
  [`host_cache`](performance-schema-host-cache-table.md "29.12.21.3 The host_cache Table") table:

  ```sql
  TRUNCATE TABLE performance_schema.host_cache;
  ```

  The [`TRUNCATE TABLE`](truncate-table.md "15.1.37 TRUNCATE TABLE Statement") operation
  requires the [`DROP`](privileges-provided.md#priv_drop) privilege
  for the table.
- The [**mysql\_upgrade**](mysql-upgrade.md "6.4.5 mysql_upgrade — Check and Upgrade MySQL Tables") client is deprecated
  because its capabilities for upgrading the system tables in
  the `mysql` system schema and objects in
  other schemas have been moved into the MySQL server. See
  [Section 3.4, “What the MySQL Upgrade Process Upgrades”](upgrading-what-is-upgraded.md "3.4 What the MySQL Upgrade Process Upgrades").
- The [`--no-dd-upgrade`](server-options.md#option_mysqld_no-dd-upgrade) server
  option is deprecated. It is superseded by the
  [`--upgrade`](server-options.md#option_mysqld_upgrade) option, which
  provides finer control over data dictionary and server
  upgrade behavior.
- The `mysql_upgrade_info` file, which is
  created data directory and used to store the MySQL version
  number, is deprecated; expect it to be removed in a future
  version of MySQL.
- The `relay_log_info_file` system variable
  and `--master-info-file` option are
  deprecated. Previously, these were used to specify the name
  of the relay log info log and source info log when
  [`relay_log_info_repository=FILE`](replication-options-replica.md#sysvar_relay_log_info_repository)
  and
  [`master_info_repository=FILE`](replication-options-replica.md#sysvar_master_info_repository)
  were set, but those settings have been deprecated. The use
  of files for the relay log info log and source info log has
  been superseded by crash-safe replica tables, which are the
  default in MySQL 8.0.
- The
  [`max_length_for_sort_data`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_max_length_for_sort_data)
  system variable is now deprecated due to optimizer changes
  that make it obsolete and of no effect.
- These legacy parameters for compression of connections to
  the server are deprecated: The
  [`--compress`](connection-options.md#option_general_compress) client
  command-line option; the
  `MYSQL_OPT_COMPRESS` option for the
  [`mysql_options()`](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/c-api/8.0/en/mysql-options.html) C API
  function; the
  [`slave_compressed_protocol`](replication-options-replica.md#sysvar_slave_compressed_protocol)
  system variable. For information about parameters to use
  instead, see
  [Section 6.2.8, “Connection Compression Control”](connection-compression-control.md "6.2.8 Connection Compression Control").
- Use of the `MYSQL_PWD` environment variable
  to specify a MySQL password is deprecated.
- Use of [`VALUES()`](miscellaneous-functions.md#function_values) to access new
  row values in
  [`INSERT
  ... ON DUPLICATE KEY UPDATE`](insert-on-duplicate.md "15.2.7.2 INSERT ... ON DUPLICATE KEY UPDATE Statement") is deprecated as of
  MySQL 8.0.20. Use aliases for the new row and columns,
  instead.
- Because specifying `ON ERROR` before
  `ON EMPTY` when invoking
  [`JSON_TABLE()`](json-table-functions.md#function_json-table) is counter to
  the SQL standard, this syntax is now deprecated in MySQL.
  Beginning with MySQL 8.0.20, the server prints a warning
  whenever you attempt to do so. When specifying both of these
  clauses in a single `JSON_TABLE()`
  invocation, make sure that `ON EMPTY` is
  used first.
- Columns with index prefixes have never been supported as
  part of a table's partitioning key; previously, these
  were allowed when creating, altering, or upgrading
  partitioned tables but were excluded by the table's
  partitioning function, and no warning that this had occurred
  was issued by the server. This permissive behavior is now
  deprecated, and subject to removal in a future version of
  MySQL in which using any such columns in the partitioning
  key causes the [`CREATE TABLE`](create-table.md "15.1.20 CREATE TABLE Statement")
  or [`ALTER TABLE`](alter-table.md "15.1.9 ALTER TABLE Statement") statement in
  they occur to be rejected.

  As of MySQL 8.0.21, whenever columns using index prefixes
  are specified as part of the partitioning key, a warning is
  generated for each such column. Whenever a
  [`CREATE TABLE`](create-table.md "15.1.20 CREATE TABLE Statement") or
  [`ALTER TABLE`](alter-table.md "15.1.9 ALTER TABLE Statement") statement is
  rejected because all columns in the proposed partitioning
  key would have index prefixes, the resulting error now
  provides the exact reason for the rejection. In either
  instance, this includes cases in which the columns used in
  the partitioning function are defined implicitly as those in
  the table's primary key by employing an empty
  `PARTITION BY KEY()` clause.

  For more information and examples, see
  [Column index prefixes not supported for key partitioning](partitioning-limitations.md#partitioning-limitations-prefixes "Column index prefixes not supported for key partitioning").
- The InnoDB memcached plugin is deprecated as of MySQL
  8.0.22; expect support for it to be removed in a future
  version of MySQL.
- The [`temptable_use_mmap`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_temptable_use_mmap)
  variable is deprecated as of MySQL 8.0.26; expect support
  for it to be removed in a future version of MySQL.
- The [`BINARY`](cast-functions.md#operator_binary) operator is
  deprecated as of MySQL 8.0.27, and you should expect its
  removal in a future version of MySQL. Use of
  `BINARY` now causes a warning. Use
  [`CAST(... AS BINARY)`](cast-functions.md#function_cast) instead.
- The
  [`default_authentication_plugin`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_default_authentication_plugin)
  variable is deprecated as of MySQL 8.0.27; expect support
  for it to be removed in a future version of MySQL.

  The
  [`default_authentication_plugin`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_default_authentication_plugin)
  variable is still used in MySQL 8.0.27, but in conjunction
  with and at a lower precedence than the new
  `authentication_policy` system variable,
  which is introduced in MySQL 8.0.27 with the multifactor
  authentication feature. For details, see
  [The Default Authentication Plugin](pluggable-authentication.md#pluggable-authentication-default-plugin "The Default Authentication Plugin").
- The [`--abort-slave-event-count`](replication-options-replica.md#option_mysqld_abort-slave-event-count)
  and
  [`--disconnect-slave-event-count`](replication-options-replica.md#option_mysqld_disconnect-slave-event-count)
  server options, used by the MySQL test suite and not
  normally used in production, are deprecated as of MySQL
  8.0.29; expect both options to be removed in a future
  version of MySQL.
- The [`myisam_repair_threads`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_myisam_repair_threads)
  system variable and [**myisamchk**](myisamchk.md "6.6.4 myisamchk — MyISAM Table-Maintenance Utility")
  [`--parallel-recover`](myisamchk-repair-options.md#option_myisamchk_parallel-recover) option
  are deprecated as of MySQL 8.0.29; expect support for both
  to be removed in a future release of MySQL.

  From MySQL 8.0.29, values other than 1 (the default) for
  [`myisam_repair_threads`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_myisam_repair_threads)
  produce a warning.
- Previously, MySQL accepted
  [`DATE`](datetime.md "13.2.2 The DATE, DATETIME, and TIMESTAMP Types"),
  [`TIME`](time.md "13.2.3 The TIME Type"),
  [`DATETIME`](datetime.md "13.2.2 The DATE, DATETIME, and TIMESTAMP Types"), and
  [`TIMESTAMP`](datetime.md "13.2.2 The DATE, DATETIME, and TIMESTAMP Types") literals containing
  an arbitrary number of (arbitrary) delimiter characters, as
  well as `DATETIME` and
  `TIMESTAMP` literals with an arbitrary
  number of whitespace characters before, after, and between
  the date and time parts. As of MySQL 8.0.29, the server
  raises a deprecation warning whenever the literal value
  contains any of the following:

  - One or more nonstandard delimiter characters
  - Excess delimiter characters
  - Whitespace other than the space character (' ',
    `0x20`)
  - Excess space characters

  One deprecation warning is issued per temporal value, even
  if there are multiple issues with it. This warning is not
  promoted to an error in strict mode, so that performing an
  [`INSERT`](insert.md "15.2.7 INSERT Statement") of such a value still
  succeeds when strict mode is in effect.

  You should expect the nonstandard behavior to be removed in
  a future version of MySQL, and take steps now to insure that
  your applications do not depend on it.

  See [String and Numeric Literals in Date and Time Context](date-and-time-literals.md#date-and-time-string-numeric-literals "String and Numeric Literals in Date and Time Context"),
  for more information and examples.
- The [`replica_parallel_type`](replication-options-replica.md#sysvar_replica_parallel_type)
  system variable and its associated server option
  `--replica-parallel-type` are deprecated as
  of MySQL 8.0.29. Beginning with this release, reading or
  setting this value raises a deprecation warning; expect it
  to be removed in a future version of MySQL.
- Beginning with MySQL 8.0.30, setting the
  [`replica_parallel_workers`](replication-options-replica.md#sysvar_replica_parallel_workers)
  system variable (or the equivalent server option) to 0 is
  deprecated, and elicits a warning. When you want a replica
  to use single threading, use
  `replica_parallel_workers=1` instead, which
  produces the same result, but with no warning.
- The [`--skip-host-cache`](server-options.md#option_mysqld_skip-host-cache) server
  option is deprecated beginning with MySQL 8.0.30; expect its
  removal in a future MySQL release. Use the
  [`host_cache_size`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_host_cache_size) system
  variable instead.
- The [`--old-style-user-limits`](server-options.md#option_mysqld_old-style-user-limits)
  option, intended for backwards compatibility with very old
  (pre-5.0.3) releases, is deprecated as of MySQL 8.0.30;
  using it now raises a warning. You should expect this option
  to be removed in a future release of MySQL.
- The
  [`innodb_log_files_in_group`](innodb-parameters.md#sysvar_innodb_log_files_in_group)
  and [`innodb_log_file_size`](innodb-parameters.md#sysvar_innodb_log_file_size)
  variables are deprecated as of MySQL 8.0.30. These variables
  are superseded by the
  [`innodb_redo_log_capacity`](innodb-parameters.md#sysvar_innodb_redo_log_capacity)
  variable. For more information, see
  [Section 17.6.5, “Redo Log”](innodb-redo-log.md "17.6.5 Redo Log").
- As of MySQL 8.0.32, the use of “FULL” as an
  unquoted identifier is deprecated, due to the fact that it
  is a reserved keyword in the SQL standard. This means that a
  statement such as `CREATE TABLE full (c1 INT, c2
  INT)` now raises a warning
  ([`ER_WARN_DEPRECATED_IDENT`](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/mysql-errors/8.0/en/server-error-reference.html#error_er_warn_deprecated_ident)).
  To prevent this from happening, change the name or, as shown
  here, encase it in backticks (`` ` ``):

  ```sql
  CREATE TABLE `full` (c1 INT, c2 INT);
  ```

  For more information, see [Section 11.3, “Keywords and Reserved Words”](keywords.md "11.3 Keywords and Reserved Words").
- Beginning with MySQL 8.0.32, the use of the dollar sign
  (`$`) as the leading character of an
  unquoted identifier is deprecated and produces a warning.
  Such usage is subject to removal in a future release of
  MySQL. This includes identifiers used as names of databases,
  tables, views, columns, or stored programs, as well as
  aliases for any of these. The dollar sign may still be used
  as the first character of a quoted identifier. See
  [Section 11.2, “Schema Object Names”](identifiers.md "11.2 Schema Object Names"), for more information.
- The [`binlog_format`](replication-options-binary-log.md#sysvar_binlog_format) server
  system variable is deprecated as of MySQL 8.0.34, and is
  subject to being removed in a future release. Changing the
  binary logging format, is also deprecated, with the
  expectation that the removal of
  `binlog_format` will leave row-based binary
  logging, already the default in MySQL 8.0, as the only
  binary logging format used or supported by MySQL. For this
  reason, new MySQL installations should use
  *only* row-based binary logging; existing
  replication setups using
  `binlog_format=STATEMENT` or
  `binlog_format=MIXED` logging format should
  be migrated to the row-based format.

  The system variables
  [`log_bin_trust_function_creators`](replication-options-binary-log.md#sysvar_log_bin_trust_function_creators)
  and
  [`log_statements_unsafe_for_binlog`](replication-options-binary-log.md#sysvar_log_statements_unsafe_for_binlog),
  are used exclusively for statement-based logging and
  replication. For this reason, they are now also deprecated,
  and subject to removal in a future version of MySQL.

  Setting or selecting the value of
  `binlog_format`,
  `log_bin_trust_function_creators`, or
  `log_statements_unsafe_for_binlog` raises a
  warning in MySQL 8.0.34 and later.
- The [**mysqlpump**](mysqlpump.md "6.5.6 mysqlpump — A Database Backup Program") client utility program is
  deprecated beginning with MySQL 8.0.34, and produces a
  deprecation warning when invoked. This program is subject to
  removal in a future version of MySQL. Since MySQL provides
  other means of performing database dumps and backups with
  the same or additional functionality, including
  [**mysqldump**](mysqldump.md "6.5.4 mysqldump — A Database Backup Program") and
  [MySQL Shell](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/mysql-shell/8.0/en/mysql-shell-utilities.html),
  this program is now considered redundant.

  The associated [**lz4\_decompress**](lz4-decompress.md "6.8.1 lz4_decompress — Decompress mysqlpump LZ4-Compressed Output") and
  [**zlib\_decompress**](zlib-decompress.md "6.8.3 zlib_decompress — Decompress mysqlpump ZLIB-Compressed Output") utilities are also
  deprecated as of MySQL 8.0.34.
- The use of a version number without a whitespace character
  following (or end of comment) is deprecated as of MySQL
  8.0.34, and raises a warning. This statement raises a
  warning in MySQL 8.0.34 or later, as shown here:

  ```sql
  mysql> CREATE TABLE t1(a INT, KEY (a)) /*!50110KEY_BLOCK_SIZE=1024*/ ENGINE=MYISAM;
  Query OK, 0 rows affected, 1 warning (0.01 sec)

  mysql> SHOW WARNINGS\G
  *************************** 1. row ***************************
    Level: Warning
     Code: 4164
  Message: Immediately starting the version comment after the version number is
  deprecated and may change behavior in a future release. Please insert a
  white-space character after the version number.
  1 row in set (0.00 sec)
  ```

  To avoid such warnings, insert one or more whitespace
  characters after the version number, like this:

  ```sql
  mysql> CREATE TABLE t2(a INT, KEY (a)) /*!50110 KEY_BLOCK_SIZE=1024*/ ENGINE=MYISAM;
  Query OK, 0 rows affected (0.00 sec)
  ```

  See also [Section 11.7, “Comments”](comments.md "11.7 Comments").
- As of MySQL 8.0.34, the
  [`sync_relay_log_info`](replication-options-replica.md#sysvar_sync_relay_log_info) system
  variable is deprecated, along with its equivalent server
  startup option
  [`--sync-relay-log-info`](replication-options-replica.md#sysvar_sync_relay_log_info). You
  should expect support for this variable, and for storing
  replication applier metadata in a file, to be removed in a
  future version of MySQL. You are advised to update any of
  your MySQL applications which may depend on it before this
  occurs.
- The
  [`binlog_transaction_dependency_tracking`](replication-options-binary-log.md#sysvar_binlog_transaction_dependency_tracking)
  server system variable is deprecated as of MySQL 8.0.35, and
  subject to removal in a future version of MySQL. Referencing
  this variable or the equivalent [**mysqld**](mysqld.md "6.3.1 mysqld — The MySQL Server")
  startup option
  `--binlog-transaction-dependency-tracking`
  now triggers a warning. There are no plans to replace this
  variable or its functionality, which is expected later to be
  made internal to the server.

### Features Removed in MySQL 8.0

The following items are obsolete and have been removed in MySQL
8.0. Where alternatives are shown, applications
should be updated to use them.

For MySQL 5.7 applications that use features
removed in MySQL 8.0, statements may fail when
replicated from a MySQL 5.7 source to a MySQL
8.0 replica, or may have different effects on
source and replica. To avoid such problems, applications that
use features removed in MySQL 8.0 should be revised
to avoid them and use alternatives when possible.

- The `innodb_locks_unsafe_for_binlog` system
  variable was removed. The [`READ
  COMMITTED`](innodb-transaction-isolation-levels.md#isolevel_read-committed) isolation level provides similar
  functionality.
- The `information_schema_stats` variable,
  introduced in MySQL 8.0.0, was removed and replaced by
  [`information_schema_stats_expiry`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_information_schema_stats_expiry)
  in MySQL 8.0.3.

  `information_schema_stats_expiry` defines
  an expiration setting for cached
  [`INFORMATION_SCHEMA`](information-schema.md "Chapter 28 INFORMATION_SCHEMA Tables") table
  statistics. For more information, see
  [Section 10.2.3, “Optimizing INFORMATION\_SCHEMA Queries”](information-schema-optimization.md "10.2.3 Optimizing INFORMATION_SCHEMA Queries").
- Code related to obsolete `InnoDB` system
  tables was removed in MySQL 8.0.3.
  [`INFORMATION_SCHEMA`](information-schema.md "Chapter 28 INFORMATION_SCHEMA Tables") views based
  on `InnoDB` system tables were replaced by
  internal system views on data dictionary tables. Affected
  `InnoDB`
  [`INFORMATION_SCHEMA`](information-schema.md "Chapter 28 INFORMATION_SCHEMA Tables") views were
  renamed:

  **Table 1.1 Renamed InnoDB Information Schema Views**

  | Old Name | New Name |
  | --- | --- |
  | `INNODB_SYS_COLUMNS` | `INNODB_COLUMNS` |
  | `INNODB_SYS_DATAFILES` | `INNODB_DATAFILES` |
  | `INNODB_SYS_FIELDS` | `INNODB_FIELDS` |
  | `INNODB_SYS_FOREIGN` | `INNODB_FOREIGN` |
  | `INNODB_SYS_FOREIGN_COLS` | `INNODB_FOREIGN_COLS` |
  | `INNODB_SYS_INDEXES` | `INNODB_INDEXES` |
  | `INNODB_SYS_TABLES` | `INNODB_TABLES` |
  | `INNODB_SYS_TABLESPACES` | `INNODB_TABLESPACES` |
  | `INNODB_SYS_TABLESTATS` | `INNODB_TABLESTATS` |
  | `INNODB_SYS_VIRTUAL` | `INNODB_VIRTUAL` |

  After upgrading to MySQL 8.0.3 or later, update any scripts
  that reference previous `InnoDB`
  [`INFORMATION_SCHEMA`](information-schema.md "Chapter 28 INFORMATION_SCHEMA Tables") view names.
- The following features related to account management are
  removed:

  - Using [`GRANT`](grant.md "15.7.1.6 GRANT Statement") to create
    users. Instead, use [`CREATE
    USER`](create-user.md "15.7.1.3 CREATE USER Statement"). Following this practice makes the
    `NO_AUTO_CREATE_USER` SQL mode
    immaterial for [`GRANT`](grant.md "15.7.1.6 GRANT Statement")
    statements, so it too is removed, and an error now is
    written to the server log when the presence of this
    value for the `sql_mode` option in the
    options file prevents [**mysqld**](mysqld.md "6.3.1 mysqld — The MySQL Server") from
    starting.
  - Using [`GRANT`](grant.md "15.7.1.6 GRANT Statement") to modify
    account properties other than privilege assignments.
    This includes authentication, SSL, and resource-limit
    properties. Instead, establish such properties at
    account-creation time with [`CREATE
    USER`](create-user.md "15.7.1.3 CREATE USER Statement") or modify them afterward with
    [`ALTER USER`](alter-user.md "15.7.1.1 ALTER USER Statement").
  - `IDENTIFIED BY PASSWORD
    'auth_string'`
    syntax for [`CREATE USER`](create-user.md "15.7.1.3 CREATE USER Statement")
    and [`GRANT`](grant.md "15.7.1.6 GRANT Statement"). Instead, use
    `IDENTIFIED WITH
    auth_plugin AS
    'auth_string'` for
    [`CREATE USER`](create-user.md "15.7.1.3 CREATE USER Statement") and
    [`ALTER USER`](alter-user.md "15.7.1.1 ALTER USER Statement"), where the
    `'auth_string'`
    value is in a format compatible with the named plugin.

    Additionally, because `IDENTIFIED BY
    PASSWORD` syntax was removed, the
    `log_builtin_as_identified_by_password`
    system variable is superfluous and was removed.
  - The `PASSWORD()` function.
    Additionally, `PASSWORD()` removal
    means that
    [`SET
    PASSWORD ... =
    PASSWORD('auth_string')`](set-password.md "15.7.1.10 SET PASSWORD Statement")
    syntax is no longer available.
  - The `old_passwords` system variable.
- The query cache was removed. Removal includes these items:

  - The `FLUSH QUERY CACHE` and
    `RESET QUERY CACHE` statements.
  - These system variables:
    `query_cache_limit`,
    `query_cache_min_res_unit`,
    `query_cache_size`,
    `query_cache_type`,
    `query_cache_wlock_invalidate`.
  - These status variables:
    `Qcache_free_blocks`,
    `Qcache_free_memory`,
    `Qcache_hits`,
    `Qcache_inserts`,
    `Qcache_lowmem_prunes`,
    `Qcache_not_cached`,
    `Qcache_queries_in_cache`,
    `Qcache_total_blocks`.
  - These thread states: `checking privileges on
    cached query`, `checking query cache
    for query`, `invalidating query cache
    entries`, `sending cached result to
    client`, `storing result in query
    cache`, `Waiting for query cache
    lock`.
  - The `SQL_CACHE`
    [`SELECT`](select.md "15.2.13 SELECT Statement") modifier.

  These deprecated query cache items remain deprecated, but
  have no effect; expect them to be removed in a future MySQL
  release:

  - The `SQL_NO_CACHE`
    [`SELECT`](select.md "15.2.13 SELECT Statement") modifier.
  - The `ndb_cache_check_time` system
    variable.

  The `have_query_cache` system variable
  remains deprecated, and always has a value of
  `NO`; expect it to be removed in a future
  MySQL release.
- The data dictionary provides information about database
  objects, so the server no longer checks directory names in
  the data directory to find databases. Consequently, the
  `--ignore-db-dir` option and
  `ignore_db_dirs` system variables are
  extraneous and are removed.
- The DDL log, also known as the metadata log, has been
  removed. Beginning with MySQL 8.0.3, this functionality is
  handled by the data dictionary
  `innodb_ddl_log` table. See
  [Viewing DDL Logs](atomic-ddl.md#atomic-ddl-view-logs "Viewing DDL Logs").
- The `tx_isolation` and
  `tx_read_only` system variables have been
  removed. Use `transaction_isolation` and
  `transaction_read_only` instead.
- The `sync_frm` system variable has been
  removed because `.frm` files have become
  obsolete.
- The `secure_auth` system variable and
  `--secure-auth` client option have been
  removed. The `MYSQL_SECURE_AUTH` option for
  the [`mysql_options()`](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/c-api/8.0/en/mysql-options.html) C API
  function was removed.
- The `multi_range_count` system variable is
  removed.
- The `log_warnings` system variable and
  `--log-warnings` server option have been
  removed. Use the
  [`log_error_verbosity`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_log_error_verbosity) system
  variable instead.
- The global scope for the
  [`sql_log_bin`](replication-options-binary-log.md#sysvar_sql_log_bin) system variable
  was removed. `sql_log_bin` has session
  scope only, and applications that rely on accessing
  `@@GLOBAL.sql_log_bin` should be adjusted.
- The `metadata_locks_cache_size` and
  `metadata_locks_hash_instances` system
  variables are removed.
- The unused `date_format`,
  `datetime_format`,
  `time_format`, and
  `max_tmp_tables` system variables are
  removed.
- These deprecated compatibility SQL modes are removed:
  `DB2`, `MAXDB`,
  `MSSQL`, `MYSQL323`,
  `MYSQL40`, `ORACLE`,
  `POSTGRESQL`,
  `NO_FIELD_OPTIONS`,
  `NO_KEY_OPTIONS`,
  `NO_TABLE_OPTIONS`. They can no longer be
  assigned to the `sql_mode` system variable
  or used as permitted values for the
  [**mysqldump**](mysqldump.md "6.5.4 mysqldump — A Database Backup Program")
  [`--compatible`](mysqldump.md#option_mysqldump_compatible) option.

  Removal of `MAXDB` means that the
  [`TIMESTAMP`](datetime.md "13.2.2 The DATE, DATETIME, and TIMESTAMP Types") data type for
  [`CREATE TABLE`](create-table.md "15.1.20 CREATE TABLE Statement") or
  [`ALTER TABLE`](alter-table.md "15.1.9 ALTER TABLE Statement") is treated as
  [`TIMESTAMP`](datetime.md "13.2.2 The DATE, DATETIME, and TIMESTAMP Types"), and is no longer
  treated as [`DATETIME`](datetime.md "13.2.2 The DATE, DATETIME, and TIMESTAMP Types").
- The deprecated `ASC` or
  `DESC` qualifiers for `GROUP
  BY` clauses are removed. Queries that previously
  relied on `GROUP BY` sorting may produce
  results that differ from previous MySQL versions. To produce
  a given sort order, provide an `ORDER BY`
  clause.
- The `EXTENDED` and
  `PARTITIONS` keywords for the
  [`EXPLAIN`](explain.md "15.8.2 EXPLAIN Statement") statement have been
  removed. These keywords are unnecessary because their effect
  is always enabled.
- These encryption-related items are removed:

  - The `ENCODE()` and
    `DECODE()` functions.
  - The `ENCRYPT()` function.
  - The `DES_ENCRYPT()`, and
    `DES_DECRYPT()` functions, the
    `--des-key-file` option, the
    `have_crypt` system variable, the
    `DES_KEY_FILE` option for the
    [`FLUSH`](flush.md "15.7.8.3 FLUSH Statement") statement, and the
    `HAVE_CRYPT` **CMake**
    option.

  In place of the removed encryption functions: For
  `ENCRYPT()`, consider using
  [`SHA2()`](encryption-functions.md#function_sha2) instead for one-way
  hashing. For the others, consider using
  [`AES_ENCRYPT()`](encryption-functions.md#function_aes-encrypt) and
  [`AES_DECRYPT()`](encryption-functions.md#function_aes-decrypt) instead.
- In MySQL 5.7, several spatial functions
  available under multiple names were deprecated to move in
  the direction of making the spatial function namespace more
  consistent, the goal being that each spatial function name
  begin with `ST_` if it performs an exact
  operation, or with `MBR` if it performs an
  operation based on minimum bounding rectangles. In MySQL
  8.0, the deprecated functions are removed to
  leave only the corresponding `ST_` and
  `MBR` functions:

  - These functions are removed in favor of the
    `MBR` names:
    `Contains()`,
    `Disjoint()`,
    `Equals()`,
    `Intersects()`,
    `Overlaps()`,
    `Within()`.
  - These functions are removed in favor of the
    `ST_` names: `Area()`,
    `AsBinary()`,
    `AsText()`, `AsWKB()`,
    `AsWKT()`, `Buffer()`,
    `Centroid()`,
    `ConvexHull()`,
    `Crosses()`,
    `Dimension()`,
    `Distance()`,
    `EndPoint()`,
    `Envelope()`,
    `ExteriorRing()`,
    `GeomCollFromText()`,
    `GeomCollFromWKB()`,
    `GeomFromText()`,
    `GeomFromWKB()`,
    `GeometryCollectionFromText()`,
    `GeometryCollectionFromWKB()`,
    `GeometryFromText()`,
    `GeometryFromWKB()`,
    `GeometryN()`,
    `GeometryType()`,
    `InteriorRingN()`,
    `IsClosed()`,
    `IsEmpty()`,
    `IsSimple()`,
    `LineFromText()`,
    `LineFromWKB()`,
    `LineStringFromText()`,
    `LineStringFromWKB()`,
    `MLineFromText()`,
    `MLineFromWKB()`,
    `MPointFromText()`,
    `MPointFromWKB()`,
    `MPolyFromText()`,
    `MPolyFromWKB()`,
    `MultiLineStringFromText()`,
    `MultiLineStringFromWKB()`,
    `MultiPointFromText()`,
    `MultiPointFromWKB()`,
    `MultiPolygonFromText()`,
    `MultiPolygonFromWKB()`,
    `NumGeometries()`,
    `NumInteriorRings()`,
    `NumPoints()`,
    `PointFromText()`,
    `PointFromWKB()`,
    `PointN()`,
    `PolyFromText()`,
    `PolyFromWKB()`,
    `PolygonFromText()`,
    `PolygonFromWKB()`,
    `SRID()`,
    `StartPoint()`,
    `Touches()`, `X()`,
    `Y()`.
  - `GLength()` is removed in favor of
    [`ST_Length()`](gis-linestring-property-functions.md#function_st-length).
- The functions described in
  [Section 14.16.4, “Functions That Create Geometry Values from WKB Values”](gis-wkb-functions.md "14.16.4 Functions That Create Geometry Values from WKB Values") previously accepted
  either WKB strings or geometry arguments. Geometry arguments
  are no longer permitted and produce an error. See that
  section for guidelines for migrating queries away from using
  geometry arguments.
- The parser no longer treats `\N` as a
  synonym for `NULL` in SQL statements. Use
  `NULL` instead.

  This change does not affect text file import or export
  operations performed with [`LOAD
  DATA`](load-data.md "15.2.9 LOAD DATA Statement") or
  [`SELECT ... INTO
  OUTFILE`](select-into.md "15.2.13.1 SELECT ... INTO Statement"), for which `NULL`
  continues to be represented by `\N`. See
  [Section 15.2.9, “LOAD DATA Statement”](load-data.md "15.2.9 LOAD DATA Statement").
- `PROCEDURE ANALYSE()` syntax is removed.
- The client-side `--ssl` and
  `--ssl-verify-server-cert` options have been
  removed. Use
  [`--ssl-mode=REQUIRED`](connection-options.md#option_general_ssl-mode) instead
  of `--ssl=1` or
  `--enable-ssl`. Use
  [`--ssl-mode=DISABLED`](connection-options.md#option_general_ssl-mode) instead
  of `--ssl=0`, `--skip-ssl`, or
  `--disable-ssl`. Use
  [`--ssl-mode=VERIFY_IDENTITY`](connection-options.md#option_general_ssl-mode)
  instead of `--ssl-verify-server-cert`
  options. (The server-side
  [`--ssl`](server-options.md#option_mysqld_ssl) option is still
  available, but is deprecated as of MySQL 8.0.26 and subject
  to removal in a future MySQL version.)

  For the C API, `MYSQL_OPT_SSL_ENFORCE` and
  `MYSQL_OPT_SSL_VERIFY_SERVER_CERT` options
  for [`mysql_options()`](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/c-api/8.0/en/mysql-options.html)
  correspond to the client-side `--ssl` and
  `--ssl-verify-server-cert` options and are
  removed. Use `MYSQL_OPT_SSL_MODE` with an
  option value of `SSL_MODE_REQUIRED` or
  `SSL_MODE_VERIFY_IDENTITY` instead.
- The `--temp-pool` server option was removed.
- The `ignore_builtin_innodb` system variable
  is removed.
- The server no longer performs conversion of pre-MySQL 5.1
  database names containing special characters to 5.1 format
  with the addition of a `#mysql50#` prefix.
  Because these conversions are no longer performed, the
  `--fix-db-names` and
  `--fix-table-names` options for
  [**mysqlcheck**](mysqlcheck.md "6.5.3 mysqlcheck — A Table Maintenance Program"), the `UPGRADE DATA
  DIRECTORY NAME` clause for the
  [`ALTER DATABASE`](alter-database.md "15.1.2 ALTER DATABASE Statement") statement, and
  the `Com_alter_db_upgrade` status variable
  are removed.

  Upgrades are supported only from one major version to
  another (for example, 5.0 to 5.1, or 5.1 to 5.5), so there
  should be little remaining need for conversion of older 5.0
  database names to current versions of MySQL. As a
  workaround, upgrade a MySQL 5.0 installation to MySQL 5.1
  before upgrading to a more recent release.
- The **mysql\_install\_db** program has been
  removed from MySQL distributions. Data directory
  initialization should be performed by invoking
  [**mysqld**](mysqld.md "6.3.1 mysqld — The MySQL Server") with the
  [`--initialize`](server-options.md#option_mysqld_initialize) or
  [`--initialize-insecure`](server-options.md#option_mysqld_initialize-insecure) option
  instead. In addition, the `--bootstrap`
  option for [**mysqld**](mysqld.md "6.3.1 mysqld — The MySQL Server") that was used by
  **mysql\_install\_db** was removed, and the
  `INSTALL_SCRIPTDIR` `CMake`
  option that controlled the installation location for
  **mysql\_install\_db** was removed.
- The generic partitioning handler was removed from the MySQL
  server. In order to support partitioning of a given table,
  the storage engine used for the table must now provide its
  own (“native”) partitioning handler. The
  `--partition` and
  `--skip-partition` options are removed from
  the MySQL Server, and partitioning-related entries are no
  longer shown in the output of [`SHOW
  PLUGINS`](show-plugins.md "15.7.7.25 SHOW PLUGINS Statement") or in the Information Schema
  [`PLUGINS`](information-schema-plugins-table.md "28.3.22 The INFORMATION_SCHEMA PLUGINS Table") table.

  Two MySQL storage engines currently provide native
  partitioning support: [`InnoDB`](innodb-storage-engine.md "Chapter 17 The InnoDB Storage Engine")
  and [`NDB`](mysql-cluster.md "Chapter 25 MySQL NDB Cluster 8.0"). Of these, only
  `InnoDB` is supported in MySQL
  8.0. Any attempt to create partitioned tables
  in MySQL 8.0 using any other storage engine
  fails.

  **Ramifications for upgrades.**
  The direct upgrade of a partitioned table using a storage
  engine other than `InnoDB` (such as
  [`MyISAM`](myisam-storage-engine.md "18.2 The MyISAM Storage Engine")) from MySQL
  5.7 (or earlier) to MySQL 8.0
  is not supported. There are two options for handling such
  a table:

  - Remove the table's partitioning, using
    [`ALTER
    TABLE ... REMOVE PARTITIONING`](alter-table-partition-operations.md "15.1.9.1 ALTER TABLE Partition Operations").
  - Change the storage engine used for the table to
    `InnoDB`, with
    [`ALTER TABLE
    ... ENGINE=INNODB`](alter-table.md "15.1.9 ALTER TABLE Statement").

  At least one of the two operations just listed must be
  performed for each partitioned non-`InnoDB`
  table prior to upgrading the server to MySQL
  8.0. Otherwise, such a table cannot be used
  following the upgrade.

  Due to the fact that table creation statements that would
  result in a partitioned table using a storage engine without
  partitioning support now fail with an error
  (ER\_CHECK\_NOT\_IMPLEMENTED), you must
  make sure that any statements in a dump file (such as that
  written by [**mysqldump**](mysqldump.md "6.5.4 mysqldump — A Database Backup Program")) from an older
  version of MySQL that you wish to import into a MySQL
  8.0 server that create partitioned tables do
  not also specify a storage engine such as
  `MyISAM` that has no native partitioning
  handler. You can do this by performing either of the
  following:

  - Remove any references to partitioning from
    `CREATE TABLE` statements that use a
    value for the `STORAGE ENGINE` option
    other than `InnoDB`.
  - Specifying the storage engine as
    `InnoDB`, or allow
    `InnoDB` to be used as the table's
    storage engine by default.

  For more information, see
  [Section 26.6.2, “Partitioning Limitations Relating to Storage Engines”](partitioning-limitations-storage-engines.md "26.6.2 Partitioning Limitations Relating to Storage Engines").
- System and status variable information is no longer
  maintained in the `INFORMATION_SCHEMA`.
  These tables are removed:
  `GLOBAL_VARIABLES`,
  `SESSION_VARIABLES`,
  `GLOBAL_STATUS`,
  `SESSION_STATUS`. Use the corresponding
  Performance Schema tables instead. See
  [Section 29.12.14, “Performance Schema System Variable Tables”](performance-schema-system-variable-tables.md "29.12.14 Performance Schema System Variable Tables"),
  and
  [Section 29.12.15, “Performance Schema Status Variable Tables”](performance-schema-status-variable-tables.md "29.12.15 Performance Schema Status Variable Tables").
  In addition, the `show_compatibility_56`
  system variable was removed. It was used in the transition
  period during which system and status variable information
  in `INFORMATION_SCHEMA` tables was moved to
  Performance Schema tables, and is no longer needed. These
  status variables are removed:
  `Slave_heartbeat_period`,
  `Slave_last_heartbeat`,
  `Slave_received_heartbeats`,
  `Slave_retried_transactions`,
  `Slave_running`. The information they
  provided is available in Performance Schema tables; see
  [Migrating to Performance Schema System and Status Variable Tables](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/performance-schema-variable-table-migration.html).
- The Performance Schema `setup_timers` table
  was removed, as was the `TICK` row in the
  [`performance_timers`](performance-schema-performance-timers-table.md "29.12.21.6 The performance_timers Table") table.
- The `libmysqld` embedded server library is
  removed, along with:

  - The [`mysql_options()`](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/c-api/8.0/en/mysql-options.html)
    `MYSQL_OPT_GUESS_CONNECTION`,
    `MYSQL_OPT_USE_EMBEDDED_CONNECTION`,
    `MYSQL_OPT_USE_REMOTE_CONNECTION`, and
    `MYSQL_SET_CLIENT_IP` options
  - The [**mysql\_config**](mysql-config.md "6.7.1 mysql_config — Display Options for Compiling Clients")
    `--libmysqld-libs`,
    `--embedded-libs`, and
    `--embedded` options
  - The **CMake**
    `WITH_EMBEDDED_SERVER`,
    `WITH_EMBEDDED_SHARED_LIBRARY`, and
    `INSTALL_SECURE_FILE_PRIV_EMBEDDEDDIR`
    options
  - The (undocumented) [**mysql**](mysql.md "6.5.1 mysql — The MySQL Command-Line Client")
    `--server-arg` option
  - The **mysqltest**
    `--embedded-server`,
    `--server-arg`, and
    `--server-file` options
  - The **mysqltest\_embedded** and
    **mysql\_client\_test\_embedded** test
    programs
- The **mysql\_plugin** utility was removed.
  Alternatives include loading plugins at server startup using
  the [`--plugin-load`](server-options.md#option_mysqld_plugin-load) or
  [`--plugin-load-add`](server-options.md#option_mysqld_plugin-load-add) option, or
  at runtime using the [`INSTALL
  PLUGIN`](install-plugin.md "15.7.4.4 INSTALL PLUGIN Statement") statement.
- The **resolveip** utility is removed.
  **nslookup**, **host**, or
  **dig** can be used instead.
- The **resolve\_stack\_dump** utility is
  removed. Stack traces from official MySQL builds are always
  symbolized, so there is no need to use
  **resolve\_stack\_dump**.
- The following server error codes are not used and have been
  removed. Applications that test specifically for any of
  these errors should be updated.

  ```none
  ER_BINLOG_READ_EVENT_CHECKSUM_FAILURE
  ER_BINLOG_ROW_RBR_TO_SBR

- The deprecated `INFORMATION_SCHEMA`
  `INNODB_LOCKS` and
  `INNODB_LOCK_WAITS` tables are removed. Use
  the Performance Schema
  [`data_locks`](performance-schema-data-locks-table.md "29.12.13.1 The data_locks Table") and
  [`data_lock_waits`](performance-schema-data-lock-waits-table.md "29.12.13.2 The data_lock_waits Table") tables instead.

  Note

  In MySQL 5.7, the `LOCK_TABLE` column in
  the `INNODB_LOCKS` table and the
  `locked_table` column in the
  `sys` schema
  [`innodb_lock_waits`](sys-innodb-lock-waits.md "30.4.3.9 The innodb_lock_waits and x$innodb_lock_waits Views") and
  [`x$innodb_lock_waits`](sys-innodb-lock-waits.md "30.4.3.9 The innodb_lock_waits and x$innodb_lock_waits Views") views
  contain combined schema/table name values. In MySQL 8.0,
  the [`data_locks`](performance-schema-data-locks-table.md "29.12.13.1 The data_locks Table") table and the
  `sys` schema views contain separate
  schema name and table name columns. See
  [Section 30.4.3.9, “The innodb\_lock\_waits and x$innodb\_lock\_waits Views”](sys-innodb-lock-waits.md "30.4.3.9 The innodb_lock_waits and x$innodb_lock_waits Views").
- `InnoDB` no longer supports compressed
  temporary tables. When
  [`innodb_strict_mode`](innodb-parameters.md#sysvar_innodb_strict_mode) is
  enabled (the default),
  [`CREATE
  TEMPORARY TABLE`](create-table.md "15.1.20 CREATE TABLE Statement") returns an error if
  `ROW_FORMAT=COMPRESSED` or
  `KEY_BLOCK_SIZE` is specified. If
  [`innodb_strict_mode`](innodb-parameters.md#sysvar_innodb_strict_mode) is
  disabled, warnings are issued and the temporary table is
  created using a non-compressed row format.
- `InnoDB` no longer creates
  `.isl` files (`InnoDB`
  Symbolic Link files) when creating tablespace data files
  outside of the MySQL data directory. The
  [`innodb_directories`](innodb-parameters.md#sysvar_innodb_directories) option
  now supports locating tablespace files created outside of
  the data directory.

  With this change, moving a remote tablespace while the
  server is offline by manually modifying an
  `.isl` file is no longer supported.
  Moving remote tablespace files is now supported by the
  [`innodb_directories`](innodb-parameters.md#sysvar_innodb_directories) option.
  See [Section 17.6.3.6, “Moving Tablespace Files While the Server is Offline”](innodb-moving-data-files-offline.md "17.6.3.6 Moving Tablespace Files While the Server is Offline").
- The following `InnoDB` file format
  variables were removed:

  - `innodb_file_format`
  - `innodb_file_format_check`
  - `innodb_file_format_max`
  - `innodb_large_prefix`

  File format variables were necessary for creating tables
  compatible with earlier versions of
  `InnoDB` in MySQL 5.1. Now that MySQL 5.1
  has reached the end of its product lifecycle, these options
  are no longer required.

  The `FILE_FORMAT` column was removed from
  the [`INNODB_TABLES`](information-schema-innodb-tables-table.md "28.4.23 The INFORMATION_SCHEMA INNODB_TABLES Table") and
  [`INNODB_TABLESPACES`](information-schema-innodb-tablespaces-table.md "28.4.24 The INFORMATION_SCHEMA INNODB_TABLESPACES Table") Information
  Schema tables.
- The `innodb_support_xa` system variable,
  which enables support for two-phase commit in XA
  transactions, was removed. `InnoDB` support
  for two-phase commit in XA transactions is always enabled.
- Support for DTrace was removed.
- The `JSON_APPEND()` function was removed.
  Use [`JSON_ARRAY_APPEND()`](json-modification-functions.md#function_json-array-append)
  instead.
- Support for placing table partitions in shared
  `InnoDB` tablespaces was removed in MySQL
  8.0.13. Shared tablespaces include the
  `InnoDB` system tablespace and general
  tablespaces. For information about identifying partitions in
  shared tablespaces and moving them to file-per-table
  tablespaces, see [Section 3.6, “Preparing Your Installation for Upgrade”](upgrade-prerequisites.md "3.6 Preparing Your Installation for Upgrade").
- Support for setting user variables in statements other than
  [`SET`](set-variable.md "15.7.6.1 SET Syntax for Variable Assignment")
  was deprecated in MySQL 8.0.13. This functionality is
  subject to removal in MySQL 8.4.
- The `--ndb` [**perror**](perror.md "6.8.2 perror — Display MySQL Error Message Information") option
  was removed. Use the [**ndb\_perror**](mysql-cluster-programs-ndb-perror.md "25.5.16 ndb_perror — Obtain NDB Error Message Information") utility
  instead.
- The `innodb_undo_logs` variable was
  removed. The
  [`innodb_rollback_segments`](innodb-parameters.md#sysvar_innodb_rollback_segments)
  variables performs the same function and should be used
  instead.
- The `Innodb_available_undo_logs` status
  variable was removed. The number of available rollback
  segments per tablespace may be retrieved using `SHOW
  VARIABLES LIKE 'innodb_rollback_segments';`
- As of MySQL 8.0.14, the previously deprecated
  [`innodb_undo_tablespaces`](innodb-parameters.md#sysvar_innodb_undo_tablespaces)
  variable is no longer configurable. For more information,
  see [Section 17.6.3.4, “Undo Tablespaces”](innodb-undo-tablespaces.md "17.6.3.4 Undo Tablespaces").
- Support for the `ALTER TABLE ... UPGRADE
  PARTITIONING` statement has been removed.
- As of MySQL 8.0.16, support for the
  [`internal_tmp_disk_storage_engine`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_internal_tmp_disk_storage_engine)
  system variable has been removed; internal temporary tables
  on disk now always use the
  [`InnoDB`](innodb-storage-engine.md "Chapter 17 The InnoDB Storage Engine") storage engine. See
  [Storage Engine for On-Disk Internal Temporary Tables](internal-temporary-tables.md#internal-temporary-tables-engines-disk "Storage Engine for On-Disk Internal Temporary Tables"),for
  more information.
- The [`DISABLE_SHARED`](source-configuration-options.md#option_cmake_disable_shared)
  **CMake** option was unused and has been
  removed.
- The [`myisam_repair_threads`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_myisam_repair_threads)
  system variable is removed as of MySQL 8.0.30.
