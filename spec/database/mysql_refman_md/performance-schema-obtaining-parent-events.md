### 29.19.2 Obtaining Parent Event Information

The [`data_locks`](performance-schema-data-locks-table.md "29.12.13.1 The data_locks Table") table shows data
locks held and requested. Rows of this table have a
`THREAD_ID` column indicating the thread ID of
the session that owns the lock, and an
`EVENT_ID` column indicating the Performance
Schema event that caused the lock. Tuples of
(`THREAD_ID`, `EVENT_ID`)
values implicitly identify a parent event in other Performance
Schema tables:

- The parent wait event in the
  `events_waits_xxx`
  tables
- The parent stage event in the
  `events_stages_xxx`
  tables
- The parent statement event in the
  `events_statements_xxx`
  tables
- The parent transaction event in the
  [`events_transactions_current`](performance-schema-events-transactions-current-table.md "29.12.7.1 The events_transactions_current Table")
  table

To obtain details about the parent event, join the
`THREAD_ID` and `EVENT_ID`
columns with the columns of like name in the appropriate parent
event table. The relation is based on a nested set data model,
so the join has several clauses. Given parent and child tables
represented by `parent` and
`child`, respectively, the join looks like
this:

```sql
WHERE
  parent.THREAD_ID = child.THREAD_ID        /* 1 */
  AND parent.EVENT_ID < child.EVENT_ID      /* 2 */
  AND (
    child.EVENT_ID <= parent.END_EVENT_ID   /* 3a */
    OR parent.END_EVENT_ID IS NULL          /* 3b */
  )
```

The conditions for the join are:

1. The parent and child events are in the same thread.
2. The child event begins after the parent event, so its
   `EVENT_ID` value is greater than that of
   the parent.
3. The parent event has either completed or is still running.

To find lock information,
[`data_locks`](performance-schema-data-locks-table.md "29.12.13.1 The data_locks Table") is the table containing
child events.

The [`data_locks`](performance-schema-data-locks-table.md "29.12.13.1 The data_locks Table") table shows only
existing locks, so these considerations apply regarding which
table contains the parent event:

- For transactions, the only choice is
  [`events_transactions_current`](performance-schema-events-transactions-current-table.md "29.12.7.1 The events_transactions_current Table"). If
  a transaction is completed, it may be in the transaction
  history tables, but the locks are gone already.
- For statements, it all depends on whether the statement that
  took a lock is a statement in a transaction that has already
  completed (use
  [`events_statements_history`](performance-schema-events-statements-history-table.md "29.12.6.2 The events_statements_history Table")) or
  the statement is still running (use
  [`events_statements_current`](performance-schema-events-statements-current-table.md "29.12.6.1 The events_statements_current Table")).
- For stages, the logic is similar to that for statements; use
  [`events_stages_history`](performance-schema-events-stages-history-table.md "29.12.5.2 The events_stages_history Table") or
  [`events_stages_current`](performance-schema-events-stages-current-table.md "29.12.5.1 The events_stages_current Table").
- For waits, the logic is similar to that for statements; use
  [`events_waits_history`](performance-schema-events-waits-history-table.md "29.12.4.2 The events_waits_history Table") or
  [`events_waits_current`](performance-schema-events-waits-current-table.md "29.12.4.1 The events_waits_current Table"). However,
  so many waits are recorded that the wait that caused a lock
  is most likely gone from the history tables already.

Wait, stage, and statement events disappear quickly from the
history. If a statement that executed a long time ago took a
lock but is in a still-open transaction, it might not be
possible to find the statement, but it is possible to find the
transaction.

This is why the nested set data model works better for locating
parent events. Following links in a parent/child relationship
(data lock -> parent wait -> parent stage -> parent
transaction) does not work well when intermediate nodes are
already gone from the history tables.

The following scenario illustrates how to find the parent
transaction of a statement in which a lock was taken:

Session A:

```sql
[1] START TRANSACTION;
[2] SELECT * FROM t1 WHERE pk = 1;
[3] SELECT 'Hello, world';
```

Session B:

```sql
SELECT ...
FROM performance_schema.events_transactions_current AS parent
  INNER JOIN performance_schema.data_locks AS child
WHERE
  parent.THREAD_ID = child.THREAD_ID
  AND parent.EVENT_ID < child.EVENT_ID
  AND (
    child.EVENT_ID <= parent.END_EVENT_ID
    OR parent.END_EVENT_ID IS NULL
  );
```

The query for session B should show statement [2] as owning a
data lock on the record with `pk=1`.

If session A executes more statements, [2] fades out of the
history table.

The query should show the transaction that started in [1],
regardless of how many statements, stages, or waits were
executed.

To see more data, you can also use the
`events_xxx_history_long`
tables, except for transactions, assuming no other query runs in
the server (so that history is preserved).
