### 10.14.1 Accessing the Process List

The following discussion enumerates the sources of process
information, the privileges required to see process information,
and describes the content of process list entries.

- [Sources of Process Information](processlist-access.md#processlist-sources "Sources of Process Information")
- [Privileges Required to Access the Process List](processlist-access.md#processlist-privileges "Privileges Required to Access the Process List")
- [Content of Process List Entries](processlist-access.md#processlist-content "Content of Process List Entries")

#### Sources of Process Information

Process information is available from these sources:

- The [`SHOW PROCESSLIST`](show-processlist.md "15.7.7.29 SHOW PROCESSLIST Statement")
  statement: [Section 15.7.7.29, “SHOW PROCESSLIST Statement”](show-processlist.md "15.7.7.29 SHOW PROCESSLIST Statement")
- The [**mysqladmin processlist**](mysqladmin.md "6.5.2 mysqladmin — A MySQL Server Administration Program") command:
  [Section 6.5.2, “mysqladmin — A MySQL Server Administration Program”](mysqladmin.md "6.5.2 mysqladmin — A MySQL Server Administration Program")
- The `INFORMATION_SCHEMA`
  [`PROCESSLIST`](information-schema-processlist-table.md "28.3.23 The INFORMATION_SCHEMA PROCESSLIST Table") table:
  [Section 28.3.23, “The INFORMATION\_SCHEMA PROCESSLIST Table”](information-schema-processlist-table.md "28.3.23 The INFORMATION_SCHEMA PROCESSLIST Table")
- The Performance Schema
  [`processlist`](performance-schema-processlist-table.md "29.12.21.7 The processlist Table") table:
  [Section 29.12.21.7, “The processlist Table”](performance-schema-processlist-table.md "29.12.21.7 The processlist Table")
- The Performance Schema
  [`threads`](performance-schema-threads-table.md "29.12.21.8 The threads Table") table columns with
  names having a prefix of `PROCESSLIST_`:
  [Section 29.12.21.8, “The threads Table”](performance-schema-threads-table.md "29.12.21.8 The threads Table")
- The `sys` schema
  [`processlist`](sys-processlist.md "30.4.3.22 The processlist and x$processlist Views") and
  [`session`](sys-session.md "30.4.3.33 The session and x$session Views") views:
  [Section 30.4.3.22, “The processlist and x$processlist Views”](sys-processlist.md "30.4.3.22 The processlist and x$processlist Views"), and
  [Section 30.4.3.33, “The session and x$session Views”](sys-session.md "30.4.3.33 The session and x$session Views")

The [`threads`](performance-schema-threads-table.md "29.12.21.8 The threads Table") table compares to
[`SHOW PROCESSLIST`](show-processlist.md "15.7.7.29 SHOW PROCESSLIST Statement"),
`INFORMATION_SCHEMA`
[`PROCESSLIST`](information-schema-processlist-table.md "28.3.23 The INFORMATION_SCHEMA PROCESSLIST Table"), and
[**mysqladmin processlist**](mysqladmin.md "6.5.2 mysqladmin — A MySQL Server Administration Program") as follows:

- Access to the [`threads`](performance-schema-threads-table.md "29.12.21.8 The threads Table") table
  does not require a mutex and has minimal impact on server
  performance. The other sources have negative performance
  consequences because they require a mutex.

  Note

  As of MySQL 8.0.22, an alternative implementation for
  [`SHOW PROCESSLIST`](show-processlist.md "15.7.7.29 SHOW PROCESSLIST Statement") is
  available based on the Performance Schema
  [`processlist`](performance-schema-processlist-table.md "29.12.21.7 The processlist Table") table, which,
  like the [`threads`](performance-schema-threads-table.md "29.12.21.8 The threads Table") table,
  does not require a mutex and has better performance
  characteristics. For details, see
  [Section 29.12.21.7, “The processlist Table”](performance-schema-processlist-table.md "29.12.21.7 The processlist Table").
- The [`threads`](performance-schema-threads-table.md "29.12.21.8 The threads Table") table displays
  background threads, which the other sources do not. It
  also provides additional information for each thread that
  the other sources do not, such as whether the thread is a
  foreground or background thread, and the location within
  the server associated with the thread. This means that the
  [`threads`](performance-schema-threads-table.md "29.12.21.8 The threads Table") table can be used to
  monitor thread activity the other sources cannot.
- You can enable or disable Performance Schema thread
  monitoring, as described in
  [Section 29.12.21.8, “The threads Table”](performance-schema-threads-table.md "29.12.21.8 The threads Table").

For these reasons, DBAs who perform server monitoring using
one of the other thread information sources may wish to
monitor using the [`threads`](performance-schema-threads-table.md "29.12.21.8 The threads Table") table
instead.

The `sys` schema
[`processlist`](sys-processlist.md "30.4.3.22 The processlist and x$processlist Views") view presents
information from the Performance Schema
[`threads`](performance-schema-threads-table.md "29.12.21.8 The threads Table") table in a more
accessible format. The `sys` schema
[`session`](sys-session.md "30.4.3.33 The session and x$session Views") view presents
information about user sessions like the
`sys` schema
[`processlist`](sys-processlist.md "30.4.3.22 The processlist and x$processlist Views") view, but with
background processes filtered out.

#### Privileges Required to Access the Process List

For most sources of process information, if you have the
[`PROCESS`](privileges-provided.md#priv_process) privilege, you can see
all threads, even those belonging to other users. Otherwise
(without the [`PROCESS`](privileges-provided.md#priv_process)
privilege), nonanonymous users have access to information
about their own threads but not threads for other users, and
anonymous users have no access to thread information.

The Performance Schema [`threads`](performance-schema-threads-table.md "29.12.21.8 The threads Table")
table also provides thread information, but table access uses
a different privilege model. See
[Section 29.12.21.8, “The threads Table”](performance-schema-threads-table.md "29.12.21.8 The threads Table").

#### Content of Process List Entries

Each process list entry contains several pieces of
information. The following list describes them using the
labels from [`SHOW PROCESSLIST`](show-processlist.md "15.7.7.29 SHOW PROCESSLIST Statement")
output. Other process information sources use similar labels.

- `Id` is the connection identifier for the
  client associated with the thread.
- `User` and `Host`
  indicate the account associated with the thread.
- `db` is the default database for the
  thread, or `NULL` if none has been
  selected.
- `Command` and `State`
  indicate what the thread is doing.

  Most states correspond to very quick operations. If a
  thread stays in a given state for many seconds, there
  might be a problem that needs to be investigated.

  The following sections list the possible
  `Command` values, and
  `State` values grouped by category. The
  meaning for some of these values is self-evident. For
  others, additional description is provided.

  Note

  Applications that examine process list information
  should be aware that the commands and states are subject
  to change.
- `Time` indicates how long the thread has
  been in its current state. The thread's notion of the
  current time may be altered in some cases: The thread can
  change the time with
  [`SET
  TIMESTAMP = value`](set-variable.md "15.7.6.1 SET Syntax for Variable Assignment").
  For a replica SQL thread, the value is the number of
  seconds between the timestamp of the last replicated event
  and the real time of the replica host. See
  [Section 19.2.3, “Replication Threads”](replication-threads.md "19.2.3 Replication Threads").
- `Info` indicates the statement the thread
  is executing, or `NULL` if it is
  executing no statement. For [`SHOW
  PROCESSLIST`](show-processlist.md "15.7.7.29 SHOW PROCESSLIST Statement"), this value contains only the first
  100 characters of the statement. To see complete
  statements, use
  [`SHOW
  FULL PROCESSLIST`](show-processlist.md "15.7.7.29 SHOW PROCESSLIST Statement") (or query a different process
  information source).
