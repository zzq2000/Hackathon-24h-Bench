#### 8.4.4.1 Keyring Components Versus Keyring Plugins

The MySQL Keyring originally implemented keystore capabilities
using server plugins, but began transitioning to use the
component infrastructure in MySQL 8.0.24. This section briefly
compares keyring components and plugins to provide an overview
of their differences. It may assist you in making the transition
from plugins to components, or, if you are just beginning to use
the keyring, assist you in choosing whether to use a component
versus using a plugin.

- Keyring plugin loading uses the
  [`--early-plugin-load`](server-options.md#option_mysqld_early-plugin-load) option.
  Keyring component loading uses a manifest.
- Keyring plugin configuration is based on plugin-specific
  system variables. For keyring components, no system
  variables are used. Instead, each component has its own
  configuration file.
- Keyring components have fewer restrictions than keyring
  plugins with respect to key types and lengths. See
  [Section 8.4.4.13, “Supported Keyring Key Types and Lengths”](keyring-key-types.md "8.4.4.13 Supported Keyring Key Types and Lengths").

  Note

  `component_keyring_oci` (like the
  `keyring_oci` plugin) can only generate
  keys of type `AES` with a size of 16, 24,
  or 32 bytes.
- Keyring components support secure storage for persisted
  system variable values, whereas keyring plugins do not
  support the function.

  A keyring component must be enabled on the MySQL server
  instance to support secure storage for persisted system
  variable values. The sensitive data that can be protected in
  this way includes items such as private keys and passwords
  that appear in the values of system variables. In the
  operating system file where persisted system variables are
  stored, the names and values of sensitive system variables
  are stored in an encrypted format, along with a generated
  file key to decrypt them. The generated file key is in turn
  encrypted using a master key that is stored in a keyring.
