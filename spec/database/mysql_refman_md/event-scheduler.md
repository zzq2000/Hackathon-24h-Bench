The MySQL Event Scheduler
manages the scheduling and execution of events, that is, tasks that
run according to a schedule. The following discussion covers the
Event Scheduler and is divided into the following sections:

- [Section 27.4.1, “Event Scheduler Overview”](events-overview.md "27.4.1 Event Scheduler Overview"), provides an introduction to
  and conceptual overview of MySQL Events.
- [Section 27.4.3, “Event Syntax”](events-syntax.md "27.4.3 Event Syntax"), discusses the SQL statements
  for creating, altering, and dropping MySQL Events.
- [Section 27.4.4, “Event Metadata”](events-metadata.md "27.4.4 Event Metadata"), shows how to obtain
  information about events and how this information is stored by
  the MySQL Server.
- [Section 27.4.6, “The Event Scheduler and MySQL Privileges”](events-privileges.md "27.4.6 The Event Scheduler and MySQL Privileges"), discusses the privileges
  required to work with events and the ramifications that events
  have with regard to privileges when executing.

Stored routines require the `events` data
dictionary table in the `mysql` system database.
This table is created during the MySQL 8.0 installation
procedure. If you are upgrading to MySQL 8.0 from an
earlier version, be sure to perform the upgrade procedure to make
sure that your system database is up to date. See
[Chapter 3, *Upgrading MySQL*](upgrading.md "Chapter 3 Upgrading MySQL").

### Additional Resources

- There are some restrictions on the use of events; see
  [Section 27.8, “Restrictions on Stored Programs”](stored-program-restrictions.md "27.8 Restrictions on Stored Programs").
- Binary logging for events takes place as described in
  [Section 27.7, “Stored Program Binary Logging”](stored-programs-logging.md "27.7 Stored Program Binary Logging").
