#### 8.4.4.4 Using the component\_keyring\_file File-Based Keyring Component

The `component_keyring_file` keyring component
stores keyring data in a file local to the server host.

Warning

For encryption key management, the
`component_keyring_file` and
`component_keyring_encrypted_file` components
are not intended as a regulatory compliance solution. Security
standards such as PCI, FIPS, and others require use of key
management systems to secure, manage, and protect encryption
keys in key vaults or hardware security modules (HSMs).

To use `component_keyring_file` for keystore
management in the most common scenario, create two files: a
manifest file that tells the server to load
`component_keyring_file`, and a configuration
file that specifies where to store the keys. Both files should
be readable only by the appropriate user that runs the server,
typically `mysql`.

The manifest file must be named `mysqld.my` and
added to the same directory where [**mysqld**](mysqld.md "6.3.1 mysqld — The MySQL Server") is
installed. The file looks like this:

```json
{
  "components": "file://component_keyring_file"
}
```

The configuration file must be named
`component_keyring_file.cnf` and added to the
plugin directory. It contains the path to the file where the
server stores keys:

```json
{
  "path": "/usr/local/mysql/keyring/component_keyring_file.keys",
  "read_only": false
}
```

After adding the two files, restart [**mysqld**](mysqld.md "6.3.1 mysqld — The MySQL Server").
Verify component installation by examining the Performance
Schema [`keyring_component_status`](performance-schema-keyring-component-status-table.md "29.12.18.1 The keyring_component_status Table")
table:

```sql
mysql> SELECT * FROM performance_schema.keyring_component_status;
```

A `Component_status` value of
`Active` indicates that the component
initialized successfully.

If the server startup fails or the
`Component_status` value is
`Disabled`, check the server error log.

For more details and to review other scenarios, see
[Section 8.4.4.2, “Keyring Component Installation”](keyring-component-installation.md "8.4.4.2 Keyring Component Installation") and

##### Configuration Notes

When it initializes, `component_keyring_file`
reads either a global configuration file, or a global
configuration file paired with a local configuration file:

- The component attempts to read its global configuration
  file from the directory where the component library file
  is installed (that is, the server plugin directory).
- If the global configuration file indicates use of a local
  configuration file, the component attempts to read its
  local configuration file from the data directory.
- Although global and local configuration files are located
  in different directories, the file name is
  `component_keyring_file.cnf` in both
  locations.
- It is an error for no configuration file to exist.
  `component_keyring_file` cannot
  initialize without a valid configuration.

Local configuration files permit setting up multiple server
instances to use `component_keyring_file`,
such that component configuration for each server instance is
specific to a given data directory instance. This enables the
same keyring component to be used with a distinct data file
for each instance.

`component_keyring_file` configuration files
have these properties:

- A configuration file must be in valid JSON format.
- A configuration file must have the appropriate file
  permission that allows MySQL to read it. Since the file
  contains sensitive information, it should be set to world
  readable.
- A configuration file permits these configuration items:

  - `"read_local_config"`: This item is
    permitted only in the global configuration file. If
    the item is not present, the component uses only the
    global configuration file. If the item is present, its
    value is `true` or
    `false`, indicating whether the
    component should read configuration information from
    the local configuration file.

    If the `"read_local_config"` item is
    present in the global configuration file along with
    other items, the component checks the
    `"read_local_config"` item value
    first:

    - If the value is `false`, the
      component processes the other items in the global
      configuration file and ignores the local
      configuration file.
    - If the value is `true`, the
      component ignores the other items in the global
      configuration file and attempts to read the local
      configuration file.
  - `"path"`: The item value is a string
    that names the file to use for storing keyring data.
    The file should be named using an absolute path, not a
    relative path. This item is mandatory in the
    configuration. If not specified,
    `component_keyring_file`
    initialization fails.
  - `"read_only"`: The item value
    indicates whether the keyring data file is read only.
    The item value is `true` (read only)
    or `false` (read/write). This item is
    mandatory in the configuration. If not specified,
    `component_keyring_file`
    initialization fails.
- The database administrator has the responsibility for
  creating any configuration files to be used, and for
  ensuring that their contents are correct. If an error
  occurs, server startup fails and the administrator must
  correct any issues indicated by diagnostics in the server
  error log.

Given the preceding configuration file properties, to
configure `component_keyring_file`, create a
global configuration file named
`component_keyring_file.cnf` in the
directory where the `component_keyring_file`
library file is installed, and optionally create a local
configuration file, also named
`component_keyring_file.cnf`, in the data
directory. The following instructions assume that a keyring
data file named
`/usr/local/mysql/keyring/component_keyring_file.keys`
is to be used in read/write fashion.

Note

For Windows systems, the path to the
`/usr/local/mysql/keyring/component_keyring_file.keys`
file can be in `C:\ProgramData`. It should
not be in `C:\Program Files`.

- To use a global configuration file only, the file contents
  look like this:

  ```json
  {
    "path": "/usr/local/mysql/keyring/component_keyring_file.keys",
    "read_only": false
  }
  ```

  Create this file in the directory where the
  `component_keyring_file` library file is
  installed.

  This path must not point to or include the MySQL data
  directory. The path must be readable and writable by the
  system MySQL user (Windows: `NETWORK
  SERVICES`; Linux: `mysql` user;
  MacOS: `_mysql` user). It should not be
  accessible to other users.
- Alternatively, to use a global and local configuration
  file pair, the global file looks like this:

  ```json
  {
    "read_local_config": true
  }
  ```

  Create this file in the directory where the
  `component_keyring_file` library file is
  installed.

  The local file looks like this:

  ```json
  {
    "path": "/usr/local/mysql/keyring/component_keyring_file.keys",
    "read_only": false
  }
  ```

  This path must not point to or include the MySQL data
  directory. The path must be readable and writable by the
  system MySQL user (Windows: `NETWORK
  SERVICES`; Linux: `mysql` user;
  MacOS: `_mysql` user). It should not be
  accessible to other users.

##### Keyring Component Usage

Keyring operations are transactional:
`component_keyring_file` uses a backup file
during write operations to ensure that it can roll back to the
original file if an operation fails. The backup file has the
same name as the data file with a suffix of
`.backup`.

`component_keyring_file` supports the
functions that comprise the standard MySQL Keyring service
interface. Keyring operations performed by those functions are
accessible in SQL statements as described in
[Section 8.4.4.15, “General-Purpose Keyring Key-Management Functions”](keyring-functions-general-purpose.md "8.4.4.15 General-Purpose Keyring Key-Management Functions").

Example:

```sql
SELECT keyring_key_generate('MyKey', 'AES', 32);
SELECT keyring_key_remove('MyKey');
```

For information about the characteristics of key values
permitted by `component_keyring_file`, see
[Section 8.4.4.13, “Supported Keyring Key Types and Lengths”](keyring-key-types.md "8.4.4.13 Supported Keyring Key Types and Lengths").
