## 27.9 Restrictions on Views

The maximum number of tables that can be referenced in the
definition of a view is 61.

View processing is not optimized:

- It is not possible to create an index on a view.
- Indexes can be used for views processed using the merge
  algorithm. However, a view that is processed with the
  temptable algorithm is unable to take advantage of indexes on
  its underlying tables (although indexes can be used during
  generation of the temporary tables).

There is a general principle that you cannot modify a table and
select from the same table in a subquery. See
[Section 15.2.15.12, “Restrictions on Subqueries”](subquery-restrictions.md "15.2.15.12 Restrictions on Subqueries").

The same principle also applies if you select from a view that
selects from the table, if the view selects from the table in a
subquery and the view is evaluated using the merge algorithm.
Example:

```sql
CREATE VIEW v1 AS
SELECT * FROM t2 WHERE EXISTS (SELECT 1 FROM t1 WHERE t1.a = t2.a);

UPDATE t1, v2 SET t1.a = 1 WHERE t1.b = v2.b;
```

If the view is evaluated using a temporary table, you
*can* select from the table in the view
subquery and still modify that table in the outer query. In this
case, the view is stored in a temporary table and thus you are not
really selecting from the table in a subquery and modifying it at
the same time. (This is another reason you might wish to force
MySQL to use the temptable algorithm by specifying
`ALGORITHM = TEMPTABLE` in the view definition.)

You can use [`DROP TABLE`](drop-table.md "15.1.32 DROP TABLE Statement") or
[`ALTER TABLE`](alter-table.md "15.1.9 ALTER TABLE Statement") to drop or alter a
table that is used in a view definition. No warning results from
the `DROP` or `ALTER` operation,
even though this invalidates the view. Instead, an error occurs
later, when the view is used. [`CHECK
TABLE`](check-table.md "15.7.3.2 CHECK TABLE Statement") can be used to check for views that have been
invalidated by `DROP` or `ALTER`
operations.

With regard to view updatability, the overall goal for views is
that if any view is theoretically updatable, it should be
updatable in practice. Many theoretically updatable views can be
updated now, but limitations still exist. For details, see
[Section 27.5.3, “Updatable and Insertable Views”](view-updatability.md "27.5.3 Updatable and Insertable Views").

There exists a shortcoming with the current implementation of
views. If a user is granted the basic privileges necessary to
create a view (the [`CREATE VIEW`](privileges-provided.md#priv_create-view) and
[`SELECT`](privileges-provided.md#priv_select) privileges), that user
cannot call [`SHOW CREATE VIEW`](show-create-view.md "15.7.7.13 SHOW CREATE VIEW Statement") on
that object unless the user is also granted the
[`SHOW VIEW`](privileges-provided.md#priv_show-view) privilege.

That shortcoming can lead to problems backing up a database with
[**mysqldump**](mysqldump.md "6.5.4 mysqldump — A Database Backup Program"), which may fail due to insufficient
privileges. This problem is described in Bug #22062.

The workaround to the problem is for the administrator to manually
grant the [`SHOW VIEW`](privileges-provided.md#priv_show-view) privilege to
users who are granted [`CREATE VIEW`](privileges-provided.md#priv_create-view),
since MySQL doesn't grant it implicitly when views are created.

Views do not have indexes, so index hints do not apply. Use of
index hints when selecting from a view is not permitted.

[`SHOW CREATE VIEW`](show-create-view.md "15.7.7.13 SHOW CREATE VIEW Statement") displays view
definitions using an `AS
alias_name` clause for each
column. If a column is created from an expression, the default
alias is the expression text, which can be quite long. Aliases for
column names in [`CREATE VIEW`](create-view.md "15.1.23 CREATE VIEW Statement")
statements are checked against the maximum column length of 64
characters (not the maximum alias length of 256 characters). As a
result, views created from the output of [`SHOW
CREATE VIEW`](show-create-view.md "15.7.7.13 SHOW CREATE VIEW Statement") fail if any column alias exceeds 64
characters. This can cause problems in the following circumstances
for views with too-long aliases:

- View definitions fail to replicate to newer replicas that
  enforce the column-length restriction.
- Dump files created with [**mysqldump**](mysqldump.md "6.5.4 mysqldump — A Database Backup Program") cannot be
  loaded into servers that enforce the column-length
  restriction.

A workaround for either problem is to modify each problematic view
definition to use aliases that provide shorter column names. Then
the view replicates properly, and can be dumped and reloaded
without causing an error. To modify the definition, drop and
create the view again with [`DROP
VIEW`](drop-view.md "15.1.35 DROP VIEW Statement") and [`CREATE VIEW`](create-view.md "15.1.23 CREATE VIEW Statement"), or
replace the definition with
[`CREATE OR REPLACE
VIEW`](create-view.md "15.1.23 CREATE VIEW Statement").

For problems that occur when reloading view definitions in dump
files, another workaround is to edit the dump file to modify its
[`CREATE VIEW`](create-view.md "15.1.23 CREATE VIEW Statement") statements. However,
this does not change the original view definitions, which may
cause problems for subsequent dump operations.
