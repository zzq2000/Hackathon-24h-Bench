#### 2.5.6.2 More Topics on Deploying MySQL Server with Docker

Note

Most of the following sample commands have
`container-registry.oracle.com/mysql/community-server`
as the Docker image being used (like with the **docker
pull** and **docker run** commands);
change that if your image is from another repository—for
example, replace it with
`container-registry.oracle.com/mysql/enterprise-server`
for MySQL Enterprise Edition images downloaded from the Oracle Container Registry
(OCR), or `mysql/enterprise-server` for MySQL Enterprise Edition
images downloaded from
[My Oracle
Support](https://support.oracle.com/).

##### The Optimized MySQL Installation for Docker

Docker images for MySQL are optimized for code size, which means
they only include crucial components that are expected to be
relevant for the majority of users who run MySQL instances in
Docker containers. A MySQL Docker installation is different from
a common, non-Docker installation in the following aspects:

- Only a limited number of binaries are included.
- All binaries are stripped; they contain no debug
  information.

Warning

Any software updates or installations users perform to the
Docker container (including those for MySQL components) may
conflict with the optimized MySQL installation created by the
Docker image. Oracle does not provide support for MySQL
products running in such an altered container, or a container
created from an altered Docker image.

##### Configuring the MySQL Server

When you start the MySQL Docker container, you can pass
configuration options to the server through the **docker
run** command. For example:

```terminal
docker run --name mysql1 -d container-registry.oracle.com/mysql/community-server:tag --character-set-server=utf8mb4 --collation-server=utf8mb4_col
```

The command starts the MySQL Server with
`utf8mb4` as the default character set and
`utf8mb4_col` as the default collation for
databases.

Another way to configure the MySQL Server is to prepare a
configuration file and mount it at the location of the server
configuration file inside the container. See
[Persisting Data and Configuration Changes](docker-mysql-more-topics.md#docker-persisting-data-configuration "Persisting Data and Configuration Changes") for
details.

##### Persisting Data and Configuration Changes

Docker containers are in principle ephemeral, and any data or
configuration are expected to be lost if the container is
deleted or corrupted (see discussions
[here](https://docs.docker.com/engine/userguide/eng-image/dockerfile_best-practices/)).
[Docker
volumes](https://docs.docker.com/engine/admin/volumes/volumes/) provides a mechanism to persist data created
inside a Docker container. At its initialization, the MySQL
Server container creates a Docker volume for the server data
directory. The JSON output from the **docker
inspect** command on the container includes a
`Mount` key, whose value provides information
on the data directory volume:

```terminal
$> docker inspect mysql1
...
 "Mounts": [
            {
                "Type": "volume",
                "Name": "4f2d463cfc4bdd4baebcb098c97d7da3337195ed2c6572bc0b89f7e845d27652",
                "Source": "/var/lib/docker/volumes/4f2d463cfc4bdd4baebcb098c97d7da3337195ed2c6572bc0b89f7e845d27652/_data",
                "Destination": "/var/lib/mysql",
                "Driver": "local",
                "Mode": "",
                "RW": true,
                "Propagation": ""
            }
        ],
...
```

The output shows that the source directory
`/var/lib/docker/volumes/4f2d463cfc4bdd4baebcb098c97d7da3337195ed2c6572bc0b89f7e845d27652/_data`,
in which data is persisted on the host, has been mounted at
`/var/lib/mysql`, the server data directory
inside the container.

Another way to preserve data is to
[bind-mount](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/service_create/#add-bind-mounts-volumes-or-memory-filesystems)
a host directory using the `--mount` option when
creating the container. The same technique can be used to
persist the configuration of the server. The following command
creates a MySQL Server container and bind-mounts both the data
directory and the server configuration file:

```terminal
docker run --name=mysql1 \
--mount type=bind,src=/path-on-host-machine/my.cnf,dst=/etc/my.cnf \
--mount type=bind,src=/path-on-host-machine/datadir,dst=/var/lib/mysql \
-d container-registry.oracle.com/mysql/community-server:tag
```

The command mounts
`path-on-host-machine/my.cnf`
at `/etc/my.cnf` (the
server configuration file inside the container), and
`path-on-host-machine/datadir`
at `/var/lib/mysql` (the data directory
inside the container). The following conditions must be met for
the bind-mounting to work:

- The configuration file
  `path-on-host-machine/my.cnf`
  must already exist, and it must contain the specification
  for starting the server by the user
  `mysql`:

  ```ini
  [mysqld]
  user=mysql
  ```

  You can also include other server configuration options in
  the file.
- The data directory
  `path-on-host-machine/datadir`
  must already exist. For server initialization to happen,
  the directory must be empty. You can also mount a
  directory prepopulated with data and start the server with
  it; however, you must make sure you start the Docker
  container with the same configuration as the server that
  created the data, and any host files or directories
  required are mounted when starting the container.

##### Running Additional Initialization Scripts

If there are any `.sh` or
`.sql` scripts you want to run on the
database immediately after it has been created, you can put them
into a host directory and then mount the directory at
`/docker-entrypoint-initdb.d/` inside the
container. For example:

```terminal
docker run --name=mysql1 \
--mount type=bind,src=/path-on-host-machine/scripts/,dst=/docker-entrypoint-initdb.d/ \
-d container-registry.oracle.com/mysql/community-server:tag
```

##### Connect to MySQL from an Application in Another Docker Container

By setting up a Docker network, you can allow multiple Docker
containers to communicate with each other, so that a client
application in another Docker container can access the MySQL
Server in the server container. First, create a Docker network:

```terminal
docker network create my-custom-net
```

Then, when you are creating and starting the server and the
client containers, use the `--network` option to
put them on network you created. For example:

```terminal
docker run --name=mysql1 --network=my-custom-net -d container-registry.oracle.com/mysql/community-server
```

```terminal
docker run --name=myapp1 --network=my-custom-net -d myapp
```

The `myapp1` container can then connect to the
`mysql1` container with the
`mysql1` hostname and vice versa, as Docker
automatically sets up a DNS for the given container names. In
the following example, we run the [**mysql**](mysql.md "6.5.1 mysql — The MySQL Command-Line Client")
client from inside the `myapp1` container to
connect to host `mysql1` in its own container:

```terminal
docker exec -it myapp1 mysql --host=mysql1 --user=myuser --password
```

For other networking techniques for containers, see the
[Docker
container networking](https://docs.docker.com/engine/userguide/networking/) section in the Docker
Documentation.

##### Server Error Log

When the MySQL Server is first started with your server
container, a [server error log](error-log.md "7.4.2 The Error Log")
is NOT generated if either of the following conditions is true:

- A server configuration file from the host has been mounted,
  but the file does not contain the system variable
  [`log_error`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_log_error) (see
  [Persisting Data and Configuration Changes](docker-mysql-more-topics.md#docker-persisting-data-configuration "Persisting Data and Configuration Changes") on
  bind-mounting a server configuration file).
- A server configuration file from the host has not been
  mounted, but the Docker environment variable
  [`MYSQL_LOG_CONSOLE`](docker-mysql-more-topics.md#docker_var_mysql-log-console)
  is `true` (which is the variable's default
  state for MySQL 8.0 server containers). The MySQL Server's
  error log is then redirected to `stderr`,
  so that the error log goes into the Docker container's log
  and is viewable using the **docker logs
  *`mysqld-container`***
  command.

To make MySQL Server generate an error log when either of the
two conditions is true, use the
[`--log-error`](server-options.md#option_mysqld_log-error) option to
[configure the
server](docker-mysql-more-topics.md#docker-configuring-server "Configuring the MySQL Server") to generate the error log at a specific location
inside the container. To persist the error log, mount a host
file at the location of the error log inside the container as
explained in
[Persisting Data and Configuration Changes](docker-mysql-more-topics.md#docker-persisting-data-configuration "Persisting Data and Configuration Changes"). However,
you must make sure your MySQL Server inside its container has
write access to the mounted host file.

##### Using MySQL Enterprise Backup with Docker

[MySQL Enterprise Backup](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/mysql-enterprise-backup/8.0/en/)
is a commercially-licensed backup utility for MySQL Server,
available with
[MySQL Enterprise Edition](https://www.mysql.com/products/enterprise/).
MySQL Enterprise Backup is included in the Docker installation of MySQL Enterprise Edition.

In the following example, we assume that you already have a
MySQL Server running in a Docker container (see
[Section 2.5.6.1, “Basic Steps for MySQL Server Deployment with Docker”](docker-mysql-getting-started.md "2.5.6.1 Basic Steps for MySQL Server Deployment with Docker") on how to start a
MySQL Server instance with Docker). For MySQL Enterprise Backup to back up the
MySQL Server, it must have access to the server's data
directory. This can be achieved by, for example,
[bind-mounting
a host directory on the data directory of the MySQL
Server](docker-mysql-more-topics.md#docker-persisting-data-configuration "Persisting Data and Configuration Changes") when you start the server:

```terminal
docker run --name=mysqlserver \
--mount type=bind,src=/path-on-host-machine/datadir/,dst=/var/lib/mysql \
-d mysql/enterprise-server:8.0
```

With this command, the MySQL Server is started with a Docker
image of the MySQL Enterprise Edition, and the host directory
*`/path-on-host-machine/datadir/`* has
been mounted onto the server's data directory
(`/var/lib/mysql`) inside the server
container. We also assume that, after the server has been
started, the required privileges have also been set up for MySQL Enterprise Backup
to access the server (see
[Grant MySQL Privileges to Backup Administrator](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/mysql-enterprise-backup/8.0/en/mysqlbackup.privileges.html), for details). Use the
following steps to back up and restore a MySQL Server instance.

To back up a MySQL Server instance running in a Docker container
using MySQL Enterprise Backup with Docker, follow the steps listed here:

1. On the same host where the MySQL Server container is
   running, start another container with an image of MySQL Enterprise Edition to
   perform a back up with the MySQL Enterprise Backup command
   [`backup-to-image`](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/mysql-enterprise-backup/8.0/en/backup-commands-backup.html#option_meb_backup-to-image). Provide access
   to the server's data directory using the bind mount we
   created in the last step. Also, mount a host directory
   (*`/path-on-host-machine/backups/`*
   in this example) onto the storage folder for backups in the
   container (`/data/backups` in the
   example) to persist the backups we are creating. Here is a
   sample command for this step, in which MySQL Enterprise Backup is started with
   a Docker image downloaded from
   [My
   Oracle Support](https://support.oracle.com/):

   ```terminal
   $> docker run \
   --mount type=bind,src=/path-on-host-machine/datadir/,dst=/var/lib/mysql \
   --mount type=bind,src=/path-on-host-machine/backups/,dst=/data/backups \
   --rm mysql/enterprise-server:8.0 \
   mysqlbackup -umysqlbackup -ppassword --backup-dir=/tmp/backup-tmp --with-timestamp \
   --backup-image=/data/backups/db.mbi backup-to-image

   mysqlbackup completed OK!
   ```

   It is important to check the end of the output by
   **mysqlbackup** to make sure the backup has
   been completed successfully.
2. The container exits once the backup job is finished and,
   with the `--rm` option used to start it, it
   is removed after it exits. An image backup has been created,
   and can be found in the host directory mounted in the last
   step for storing backups, as shown here:

   ```terminal
   $> ls /tmp/backups
   db.mbi
   ```

To restore a MySQL Server instance in a Docker container using
MySQL Enterprise Backup with Docker, follow the steps listed here:

1. Stop the MySQL Server container, which also stops the MySQL
   Server running inside:

   ```terminal
   docker stop mysqlserver
   ```
2. On the host, delete all contents in the bind mount for the
   MySQL Server data directory:

   ```terminal
   rm -rf /path-on-host-machine/datadir/*
   ```
3. Start a container with an image of MySQL Enterprise Edition to perform the
   restore with the MySQL Enterprise Backup command
   [`copy-back-and-apply-log`](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/mysql-enterprise-backup/8.0/en/backup-commands-restore.html#option_meb_copy-back-and-apply-log).
   Bind-mount the server's data directory and the storage
   folder for the backups, like what we did when we backed up
   the server:

   ```terminal
   $> docker run \
   --mount type=bind,src=/path-on-host-machine/datadir/,dst=/var/lib/mysql \
   --mount type=bind,src=/path-on-host-machine/backups/,dst=/data/backups \
   --rm mysql/enterprise-server:8.0 \
   mysqlbackup --backup-dir=/tmp/backup-tmp --with-timestamp \
   --datadir=/var/lib/mysql --backup-image=/data/backups/db.mbi copy-back-and-apply-log

   The container exits once the backup job is finished and,
   with the `--rm` option used when starting it,
   it is removed after it exits.
4. Restart the server container, which also restarts the
   restored server, using the following command:

   ```terminal
   docker restart mysqlserver
   ```

   Or, start a new MySQL Server on the restored data directory,
   as shown here:

   ```terminal
   docker run --name=mysqlserver2 \
   --mount type=bind,src=/path-on-host-machine/datadir/,dst=/var/lib/mysql \
   -d mysql/enterprise-server:8.0
   ```

   Log on to the server to check that the server is running
   with the restored data.

##### Using [**mysqldump**](mysqldump.md "6.5.4 mysqldump — A Database Backup Program") with Docker

Besides [using MySQL Enterprise Backup to back up a
MySQL Server running in a Docker container](docker-mysql-more-topics.md#docker-meb "Using MySQL Enterprise Backup with Docker"), you can
perform a logical backup of your server by using the
[**mysqldump**](mysqldump.md "6.5.4 mysqldump — A Database Backup Program") utility, run inside a Docker
container.

The following instructions assume that you already have a MySQL
Server running in a Docker container and, when the container was
first started, a host directory
*`/path-on-host-machine/datadir/`* has
been mounted onto the server's data directory
`/var/lib/mysql` (see
[bind-mounting
a host directory on the data directory of the MySQL
Server](docker-mysql-more-topics.md#docker-persisting-data-configuration "Persisting Data and Configuration Changes") for details), which contains the Unix socket file
by which [**mysqldump**](mysqldump.md "6.5.4 mysqldump — A Database Backup Program") and
[**mysql**](mysql.md "6.5.1 mysql — The MySQL Command-Line Client") can connect to the server. We also
assume that, after the server has been started, a user with the
proper privileges (`admin` in this example) has
been created, with which [**mysqldump**](mysqldump.md "6.5.4 mysqldump — A Database Backup Program") can access
the server. Use the following steps to back up and restore MySQL
Server data:

*Backing up MySQL Server data using
[**mysqldump**](mysqldump.md "6.5.4 mysqldump — A Database Backup Program") with Docker*:

1. On the same host where the MySQL Server container is
   running, start another container with an image of MySQL
   Server to perform a backup with the
   [**mysqldump**](mysqldump.md "6.5.4 mysqldump — A Database Backup Program") utility (see documentation of
   the utility for its functionality, options, and
   limitations). Provide access to the server's data
   directory by bind mounting
   *`/path-on-host-machine/datadir/`*.
   Also, mount a host directory
   (*`/path-on-host-machine/backups/`*
   in this example) onto a storage folder for backups inside
   the container (`/data/backups` is used in
   this example) to persist the backups you are creating. Here
   is a sample command for backing up all databases on the
   server using this setup:

   ```terminal
   $> docker run --entrypoint "/bin/sh" \
   --mount type=bind,src=/path-on-host-machine/datadir/,dst=/var/lib/mysql \
   --mount type=bind,src=/path-on-host-machine/backups/,dst=/data/backups \
   --rm container-registry.oracle.com/mysql/community-server:8.0 \
   -c "mysqldump -uadmin --password='password' --all-databases > /data/backups/all-databases.sql"
   ```

   In the command, the `--entrypoint` option
   is used so that the system shell is invoked after the
   container is started, and the `-c` option
   is used to specify the [**mysqldump**](mysqldump.md "6.5.4 mysqldump — A Database Backup Program") command
   to be run in the shell, whose output is redirected to the
   file `all-databases.sql` in the backup
   directory.
2. The container exits once the backup job is finished and,
   with the `--rm` option used to start it, it
   is removed after it exits. A logical backup been created,
   and can be found in the host directory mounted for storing
   the backup, as shown here:

   ```terminal
   $> ls /path-on-host-machine/backups/
   all-databases.sql
   ```

*Restoring MySQL Server data using
[**mysqldump**](mysqldump.md "6.5.4 mysqldump — A Database Backup Program") with Docker*:

1. Make sure you have a MySQL Server running in a container,
   onto which you want your backed-up data to be restored.
2. Start a container with an image of MySQL Server to perform
   the restore with a [**mysql**](mysql.md "6.5.1 mysql — The MySQL Command-Line Client") client.
   Bind-mount the server's data directory, as well as the
   storage folder that contains your backup:

   ```terminal
   $> docker run  \
   --mount type=bind,src=/path-on-host-machine/datadir/,dst=/var/lib/mysql \
   --mount type=bind,src=/path-on-host-machine/backups/,dst=/data/backups \
   --rm container-registry.oracle.com/mysql/community-server:8.0 \
   mysql -uadmin --password='password' -e "source /data/backups/all-databases.sql"
   ```

   The container exits once the backup job is finished and,
   with the `--rm` option used when starting it,
   it is removed after it exits.
3. Log on to the server to check that the restored data is now
   on the server.

##### Known Issues

- When using the server system variable
  [`audit_log_file`](audit-log-reference.md#sysvar_audit_log_file) to configure
  the audit log file name, use the `loose`
  [option modifier](option-modifiers.md "6.2.2.4 Program Option Modifiers") with
  it; otherwise, Docker cannot start the server.

##### Docker Environment Variables

When you create a MySQL Server container, you can configure the
MySQL instance by using the `--env` option (short
form `-e`) and specifying one or more environment
variables. No server initialization is performed if the mounted
data directory is not empty, in which case setting any of these
variables has no effect (see
[Persisting Data and Configuration Changes](docker-mysql-more-topics.md#docker-persisting-data-configuration "Persisting Data and Configuration Changes")), and no
existing contents of the directory, including server settings,
are modified during container startup.

Environment variables which can be used to configure a MySQL
instance are listed here:

- The boolean variables including
  [`MYSQL_RANDOM_ROOT_PASSWORD`](docker-mysql-more-topics.md#docker_var_mysql_random_root_password),
  [`MYSQL_ONETIME_PASSWORD`](docker-mysql-more-topics.md#docker_var_mysql_onetime_password),
  [`MYSQL_ALLOW_EMPTY_PASSWORD`](docker-mysql-more-topics.md#docker_var_mysql-allow-empty-password),
  and
  [`MYSQL_LOG_CONSOLE`](docker-mysql-more-topics.md#docker_var_mysql-log-console)
  are made true by setting them with any strings of nonzero
  lengths.
  Therefore, setting them to, for example, “0”,
  “false”, or “no” does not make
  them false, but actually makes them true. This is a known
  issue.
- [`MYSQL_RANDOM_ROOT_PASSWORD`](docker-mysql-more-topics.md#docker_var_mysql_random_root_password):
  When this variable is true (which is its default state,
  unless
  [`MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD`](docker-mysql-more-topics.md#docker_var_mysql-root-password)
  is set or
  [`MYSQL_ALLOW_EMPTY_PASSWORD`](docker-mysql-more-topics.md#docker_var_mysql-allow-empty-password)
  is set to true), a random password for the server's root
  user is generated when the Docker container is started. The
  password is printed to `stdout` of the
  container and can be found by looking at the container’s
  log (see [Starting a MySQL Server Instance](docker-mysql-getting-started.md#docker-starting-mysql-server "Starting a MySQL Server Instance")).
- [`MYSQL_ONETIME_PASSWORD`](docker-mysql-more-topics.md#docker_var_mysql_onetime_password):
  When the variable is true (which is its default state,
  unless
  [`MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD`](docker-mysql-more-topics.md#docker_var_mysql-root-password)
  is set or
  [`MYSQL_ALLOW_EMPTY_PASSWORD`](docker-mysql-more-topics.md#docker_var_mysql-allow-empty-password)
  is set to true), the root user's password is set as expired
  and must be changed before MySQL can be used normally.
- [`MYSQL_DATABASE`](docker-mysql-more-topics.md#docker_var_mysql_database):
  This variable allows you to specify the name of a database
  to be created on image startup. If a user name and a
  password are supplied with
  [`MYSQL_USER`](docker-mysql-more-topics.md#docker_var_mysql_user_password)
  and
  [`MYSQL_PASSWORD`](docker-mysql-more-topics.md#docker_var_mysql_user_password),
  the user is created and granted superuser access to this
  database (corresponding to `GRANT ALL`).
  The specified database is created by a
  [CREATE DATABASE IF NOT
  EXIST](create-database.md "15.1.12 CREATE DATABASE Statement") statement, so that the variable has no effect
  if the database already exists.
- [`MYSQL_USER`](docker-mysql-more-topics.md#docker_var_mysql_user_password),
  [`MYSQL_PASSWORD`](docker-mysql-more-topics.md#docker_var_mysql_user_password):
  These variables are used in conjunction to create a user and
  set that user's password, and the user is granted superuser
  permissions for the database specified by the
  [`MYSQL_DATABASE`](docker-mysql-more-topics.md#docker_var_mysql_database)
  variable. Both
  [`MYSQL_USER`](docker-mysql-more-topics.md#docker_var_mysql_user_password)
  and
  [`MYSQL_PASSWORD`](docker-mysql-more-topics.md#docker_var_mysql_user_password)
  are required for a user to be created—if any of the
  two variables is not set, the other is ignored. If both
  variables are set but
  [`MYSQL_DATABASE`](docker-mysql-more-topics.md#docker_var_mysql_database)
  is not, the user is created without any privileges.

  Note

  There is no need to use this mechanism to create the
  root superuser, which is created by default with the
  password set by either one of the mechanisms discussed
  in the descriptions for
  [`MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD`](docker-mysql-more-topics.md#docker_var_mysql-root-password)
  and
  [`MYSQL_RANDOM_ROOT_PASSWORD`](docker-mysql-more-topics.md#docker_var_mysql_random_root_password),
  unless
  [`MYSQL_ALLOW_EMPTY_PASSWORD`](docker-mysql-more-topics.md#docker_var_mysql-allow-empty-password)
  is true.
- [`MYSQL_ROOT_HOST`](docker-mysql-more-topics.md#docker_var_mysql-root-host):
  By default, MySQL creates the
  `'root'@'localhost'` account. This account
  can only be connected to from inside the container as
  described in
  [Connecting to MySQL Server from within the Container](docker-mysql-getting-started.md#docker-connecting-within-container "Connecting to MySQL Server from within the Container"). To
  allow root connections from other hosts, set this
  environment variable. For example, the value
  `172.17.0.1`, which is the default Docker
  gateway IP, allows connections from the host machine that
  runs the container. The option accepts only one entry, but
  wildcards are allowed (for example,
  `MYSQL_ROOT_HOST=172.*.*.*` or
  `MYSQL_ROOT_HOST=%`).
- [`MYSQL_LOG_CONSOLE`](docker-mysql-more-topics.md#docker_var_mysql-log-console):
  When the variable is true (which is its default state for
  MySQL 8.0 server containers), the MySQL Server's error log
  is redirected to `stderr`, so that the
  error log goes into the Docker container's log and is
  viewable using the **docker logs
  *`mysqld-container`***
  command.

  Note

  The variable has no effect if a server configuration file
  from the host has been mounted (see
  [Persisting Data and Configuration Changes](docker-mysql-more-topics.md#docker-persisting-data-configuration "Persisting Data and Configuration Changes") on
  bind-mounting a configuration file).
- [`MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD`](docker-mysql-more-topics.md#docker_var_mysql-root-password):
  This variable specifies a password that is set for the MySQL
  root account.

  Warning

  Setting the MySQL root user password on the command line
  is insecure. As an alternative to specifying the password
  explicitly, you can set the variable with a container file
  path for a password file, and then mount a file from your
  host that contains the password at the container file
  path. This is still not very secure, as the location of
  the password file is still exposed. It is preferable to
  use the default settings of
  [`MYSQL_RANDOM_ROOT_PASSWORD`](docker-mysql-more-topics.md#docker_var_mysql_random_root_password)
  and
  [`MYSQL_ONETIME_PASSWORD`](docker-mysql-more-topics.md#docker_var_mysql_onetime_password)
  both being true.
- [`MYSQL_ALLOW_EMPTY_PASSWORD`](docker-mysql-more-topics.md#docker_var_mysql-allow-empty-password).
  Set it to true to allow the container to be started with a
  blank password for the root user.

  Warning

  Setting this variable to true is insecure, because it is
  going to leave your MySQL instance completely
  unprotected, allowing anyone to gain complete superuser
  access. It is preferable to use the default settings of
  [`MYSQL_RANDOM_ROOT_PASSWORD`](docker-mysql-more-topics.md#docker_var_mysql_random_root_password)
  and
  [`MYSQL_ONETIME_PASSWORD`](docker-mysql-more-topics.md#docker_var_mysql_onetime_password)
  both being true.
