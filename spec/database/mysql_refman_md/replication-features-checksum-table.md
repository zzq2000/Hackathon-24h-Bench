#### 19.5.1.4 Replication and CHECKSUM TABLE

[`CHECKSUM TABLE`](checksum-table.md "15.7.3.3 CHECKSUM TABLE Statement") returns a checksum
that is calculated row by row, using a method that depends on
the table row storage format. The storage format is not
guaranteed to remain the same between MySQL versions, so the
checksum value might change following an upgrade.
