#### 30.4.3.16 The memory\_by\_host\_by\_current\_bytes and x$memory\_by\_host\_by\_current\_bytes Views

These views summarize memory use, grouped by host. By default,
rows are sorted by descending amount of memory used.

The
[`memory_by_host_by_current_bytes`](sys-memory-by-host-by-current-bytes.md "30.4.3.16 The memory_by_host_by_current_bytes and x$memory_by_host_by_current_bytes Views")
and
[`x$memory_by_host_by_current_bytes`](sys-memory-by-host-by-current-bytes.md "30.4.3.16 The memory_by_host_by_current_bytes and x$memory_by_host_by_current_bytes Views")
views have these columns:

- `host`

  The host from which the client connected. Rows for which
  the `HOST` column in the underlying
  Performance Schema table is `NULL` are
  assumed to be for background threads and are reported with
  a host name of `background`.
- `current_count_used`

  The current number of allocated memory blocks that have
  not been freed yet for the host.
- `current_allocated`

  The current number of allocated bytes that have not been
  freed yet for the host.
- `current_avg_alloc`

  The current number of allocated bytes per memory block for
  the host.
- `current_max_alloc`

  The largest single current memory allocation in bytes for
  the host.
- `total_allocated`

  The total memory allocation in bytes for the host.
