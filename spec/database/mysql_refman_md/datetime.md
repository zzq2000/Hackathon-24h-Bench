### 13.2.2 The DATE, DATETIME, and TIMESTAMP Types

The `DATE`, `DATETIME`, and
`TIMESTAMP` types are related. This section
describes their characteristics, how they are similar, and how
they differ. MySQL recognizes `DATE`,
`DATETIME`, and `TIMESTAMP`
values in several formats, described in
[Section 11.1.3, “Date and Time Literals”](date-and-time-literals.md "11.1.3 Date and Time Literals"). For the
`DATE` and `DATETIME` range
descriptions, “supported” means that although
earlier values might work, there is no guarantee.

The `DATE` type is used for values with a date
part but no time part. MySQL retrieves and displays
`DATE` values in
`'YYYY-MM-DD'`
format. The supported range is `'1000-01-01'`
to `'9999-12-31'`.

The `DATETIME` type is used for values that
contain both date and time parts. MySQL retrieves and displays
`DATETIME` values in
`'YYYY-MM-DD
hh:mm:ss'` format. The supported range is
`'1000-01-01 00:00:00'` to `'9999-12-31
23:59:59'`.

The `TIMESTAMP` data type is used for values
that contain both date and time parts.
`TIMESTAMP` has a range of `'1970-01-01
00:00:01'` UTC to `'2038-01-19
03:14:07'` UTC.

A `DATETIME` or `TIMESTAMP`
value can include a trailing fractional seconds part in up to
microseconds (6 digits) precision. In particular, any fractional
part in a value inserted into a `DATETIME` or
`TIMESTAMP` column is stored rather than
discarded. With the fractional part included, the format for
these values is `'YYYY-MM-DD
hh:mm:ss[.fraction]'`,
the range for `DATETIME` values is
`'1000-01-01 00:00:00.000000'` to
`'9999-12-31 23:59:59.499999'`, and the range
for `TIMESTAMP` values is `'1970-01-01
00:00:01.000000'` to `'2038-01-19
03:14:07.499999'`. The fractional part should always be
separated from the rest of the time by a decimal point; no other
fractional seconds delimiter is recognized. For information
about fractional seconds support in MySQL, see
[Section 13.2.6, “Fractional Seconds in Time Values”](fractional-seconds.md "13.2.6 Fractional Seconds in Time Values").

The `TIMESTAMP` and `DATETIME`
data types offer automatic initialization and updating to the
current date and time. For more information, see
[Section 13.2.5, “Automatic Initialization and Updating for TIMESTAMP and DATETIME”](timestamp-initialization.md "13.2.5 Automatic Initialization and Updating for TIMESTAMP and DATETIME").

MySQL converts `TIMESTAMP` values from the
current time zone to UTC for storage, and back from UTC to the
current time zone for retrieval. (This does not occur for other
types such as `DATETIME`.) By default, the
current time zone for each connection is the server's time. The
time zone can be set on a per-connection basis. As long as the
time zone setting remains constant, you get back the same value
you store. If you store a `TIMESTAMP` value,
and then change the time zone and retrieve the value, the
retrieved value is different from the value you stored. This
occurs because the same time zone was not used for conversion in
both directions. The current time zone is available as the value
of the [`time_zone`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_time_zone) system
variable. For more information, see
[Section 7.1.15, “MySQL Server Time Zone Support”](time-zone-support.md "7.1.15 MySQL Server Time Zone Support").

In MySQL 8.0.19 and later, you can specify a time zone offset
when inserting a `TIMESTAMP` or
`DATETIME` value into a table. See
[Section 11.1.3, “Date and Time Literals”](date-and-time-literals.md "11.1.3 Date and Time Literals"), for more information
and examples.

Invalid `DATE`, `DATETIME`, or
`TIMESTAMP` values are converted to the
“zero” value of the appropriate type
(`'0000-00-00'` or `'0000-00-00
00:00:00'`), if the SQL mode permits this conversion.
The precise behavior depends on which if any of strict SQL mode
and the [`NO_ZERO_DATE`](sql-mode.md#sqlmode_no_zero_date) SQL mode
are enabled; see [Section 7.1.11, “Server SQL Modes”](sql-mode.md "7.1.11 Server SQL Modes").

In MySQL 8.0.22 and later, you can convert
`TIMESTAMP` values to UTC
`DATETIME` values when retrieving them using
[`CAST()`](cast-functions.md#function_cast) with the `AT TIME
ZONE` operator, as shown here:

```sql
mysql> SELECT col,
     >     CAST(col AT TIME ZONE INTERVAL '+00:00' AS DATETIME) AS ut
     >     FROM ts ORDER BY id;
+---------------------+---------------------+
| col                 | ut                  |
+---------------------+---------------------+
| 2020-01-01 10:10:10 | 2020-01-01 15:10:10 |
| 2019-12-31 23:40:10 | 2020-01-01 04:40:10 |
| 2020-01-01 13:10:10 | 2020-01-01 18:10:10 |
| 2020-01-01 10:10:10 | 2020-01-01 15:10:10 |
| 2020-01-01 04:40:10 | 2020-01-01 09:40:10 |
| 2020-01-01 18:10:10 | 2020-01-01 23:10:10 |
+---------------------+---------------------+
```

For complete information regarding syntax and additional
examples, see the description of the
[`CAST()`](cast-functions.md#function_cast) function.

Be aware of certain properties of date value interpretation in
MySQL:

- MySQL permits a “relaxed” format for values
  specified as strings, in which any punctuation character may
  be used as the delimiter between date parts or time parts.
  In some cases, this syntax can be deceiving. For example, a
  value such as `'10:11:12'` might look like
  a time value because of the `:`, but is
  interpreted as the year `'2010-11-12'` if
  used in date context. The value
  `'10:45:15'` is converted to
  `'0000-00-00'` because
  `'45'` is not a valid month.

  The only delimiter recognized between a date and time part
  and a fractional seconds part is the decimal point.
- The server requires that month and day values be valid, and
  not merely in the range 1 to 12 and 1 to 31, respectively.
  With strict mode disabled, invalid dates such as
  `'2004-04-31'` are converted to
  `'0000-00-00'` and a warning is generated.
  With strict mode enabled, invalid dates generate an error.
  To permit such dates, enable
  [`ALLOW_INVALID_DATES`](sql-mode.md#sqlmode_allow_invalid_dates). See
  [Section 7.1.11, “Server SQL Modes”](sql-mode.md "7.1.11 Server SQL Modes"), for more information.
- MySQL does not accept `TIMESTAMP` values
  that include a zero in the day or month column or values
  that are not a valid date. The sole exception to this rule
  is the special “zero” value
  `'0000-00-00 00:00:00'`, if the SQL mode
  permits this value. The precise behavior depends on which if
  any of strict SQL mode and the
  [`NO_ZERO_DATE`](sql-mode.md#sqlmode_no_zero_date) SQL mode are
  enabled; see [Section 7.1.11, “Server SQL Modes”](sql-mode.md "7.1.11 Server SQL Modes").
- Dates containing 2-digit year values are ambiguous because
  the century is unknown. MySQL interprets 2-digit year values
  using these rules:

  - Year values in the range `00-69` become
    `2000-2069`.
  - Year values in the range `70-99` become
    `1970-1999`.
