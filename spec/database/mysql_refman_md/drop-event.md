### 15.1.25 DROP EVENT Statement

```sql
DROP EVENT [IF EXISTS] event_name
```

This statement drops the event named
*`event_name`*. The event immediately
ceases being active, and is deleted completely from the server.

If the event does not exist, the error ERROR 1517
(HY000): Unknown event
'*`event_name`*' results. You
can override this and cause the statement to generate a warning
for nonexistent events instead using `IF EXISTS`.

This statement requires the [`EVENT`](privileges-provided.md#priv_event)
privilege for the schema to which the event to be dropped belongs.
