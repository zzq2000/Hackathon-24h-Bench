#### 8.4.5.5 Configuring Audit Logging Characteristics

This section describes how to configure audit logging
characteristics, such as the file to which the audit log plugin
writes events, the format of written events, whether to enable
log file compression and encryption, and space management.

Note

Encryption capabilities described here apply as of MySQL
8.0.17, with the exception of the section that compares
current encryption capabilities to the previous more-limited
capabilities; see
[Audit Log File Encryption Prior to MySQL 8.0.17](audit-log-logging-configuration.md#audit-log-file-encryption-old "Audit Log File Encryption Prior to MySQL 8.0.17").

For additional information about the functions and system
variables that affect audit logging, see
[Audit Log Functions](audit-log-reference.md#audit-log-routines "Audit Log Functions"), and
[Audit Log Options and Variables](audit-log-reference.md#audit-log-options-variables "Audit Log Options and Variables").

The audit log plugin can also control which audited events are
written to the audit log file, based on event content or the
account from which events originate. See
[Section 8.4.5.7, “Audit Log Filtering”](audit-log-filtering.md "8.4.5.7 Audit Log Filtering").

##### Naming Conventions for Audit Log Files

To configure the audit log file name, set the
[`audit_log_file`](audit-log-reference.md#sysvar_audit_log_file) system
variable at server startup. The default name is
`audit.log` in the server data directory.
For best security, write the audit log to a directory
accessible only to the MySQL server and to users with a
legitimate reason to view the log.

The plugin interprets the
[`audit_log_file`](audit-log-reference.md#sysvar_audit_log_file) value as
composed of an optional leading directory name, a base name,
and an optional suffix. If compression or encryption are
enabled, the effective file name (the name actually used to
create the log file) differs from the configured file name
because it has additional suffixes:

- If compression is enabled, the plugin adds a suffix of
  `.gz`.
- If encryption is enabled, the plugin adds a suffix of
  `.pwd_id.enc`,
  where *`pwd_id`* indicates which
  encryption password to use for log file operations. The
  audit log plugin stores encryption passwords in the
  keyring; see [Encrypting Audit Log Files](audit-log-logging-configuration.md#audit-log-file-encryption "Encrypting Audit Log Files").

The effective audit log file name is the name resulting from
the addition of applicable compression and encryption suffixes
to the configured file name. For example, if the configured
[`audit_log_file`](audit-log-reference.md#sysvar_audit_log_file) value is
`audit.log`, the effective file name is one
of the values shown in the following table.

| Enabled Features | Effective File Name |
| --- | --- |
| No compression or encryption | `audit.log` |
| Compression | `audit.log.gz` |
| Encryption | `audit.log.pwd_id.enc` |
| Compression, encryption | `audit.log.gz.pwd_id.enc` |

*`pwd_id`* indicates the ID of the
password used to encrypt or decrypt a file.
*`pwd_id`* format is
*`pwd_timestamp-seq`*, where:

- *`pwd_timestamp`* is a UTC value in
  `YYYYMMDDThhmmss`
  format indicating when the password was created.
- *`seq`* is a sequence number.
  Sequence numbers start at 1 and increase for passwords
  that have the same
  *`pwd_timestamp`* value.

Here are some example *`pwd_id`*
password ID values:

```none
20190403T142359-1
20190403T142400-1
20190403T142400-2
```

To construct the corresponding keyring IDs for storing
passwords in the keyring, the audit log plugin adds a prefix
of `audit_log-` to the
*`pwd_id`* values. For the example
password IDs just shown, the corresponding keyring IDs are:

```none
audit_log-20190403T142359-1
audit_log-20190403T142400-1
audit_log-20190403T142400-2
```

The ID of the password currently used for encryption by the
audit log plugin is the one having the largest
*`pwd_timestamp`* value. If multiple
passwords have that *`pwd_timestamp`*
value, the current password ID is the one with the largest
sequence number. For example, in the preceding set of password
IDs, two of them have the largest timestamp,
`20190403T142400`, so the current password ID
is the one with the largest sequence number
(`2`).

The audit log plugin performs certain actions during
initialization and termination based on the effective audit
log file name:

- During initialization, the plugin checks whether a file
  with the audit log file name already exists and renames it
  if so. (In this case, the plugin assumes that the previous
  server invocation exited unexpectedly with the audit log
  plugin running.) The plugin then writes to a new empty
  audit log file.
- During termination, the plugin renames the audit log file.
- File renaming (whether during plugin initialization or
  termination) occurs according to the usual rules for
  automatic size-based log file rotation; see
  [Manual Audit Log File Rotation (Before MySQL 8.0.31)](audit-log-logging-configuration.md#audit-log-manual-rotation "Manual Audit Log File Rotation (Before MySQL 8.0.31)").

##### Selecting Audit Log File Format

To configure the audit log file format, set the
[`audit_log_format`](audit-log-reference.md#sysvar_audit_log_format) system
variable at server startup. These formats are available:

- `NEW`: New-style XML format. This is the
  default.
- `OLD`: Old-style XML format.
- `JSON`: JSON format. Writes the audit log
  as a JSON array. Only this format supports the optional
  query time and size statistics, which are available from
  MySQL 8.0.30.

For details about each format, see
[Section 8.4.5.4, “Audit Log File Formats”](audit-log-file-formats.md "8.4.5.4 Audit Log File Formats").

##### Enabling the Audit Log Flush Task

Starting in MySQL 8.0.34, MySQL Enterprise Audit provides the capability of
setting a refresh interval to dispose of the in-memory cache
automatically. A flush task configured using the
[`audit_log_flush_interval_seconds`](audit-log-reference.md#sysvar_audit_log_flush_interval_seconds)
system variable has a value of zero by default, which means
the task is not scheduled to run.

When the task is configured to run (the value is non-zero),
MySQL Enterprise Audit attempts to call the
[scheduler](scheduler-component.md "7.5.5 Scheduler Component") component
at its initialization and configure a regular, recurring flush
of its memory cache:

- If the audit log cannot find an implementation of the
  scheduler registration service, it does not schedule the
  flush and continue loading.
- Audit log implements the
  `dynamic_loader_services_loaded_notification`
  service and listens for new registrations of
  `mysql_scheduler` so that audit log can
  register its scheduled task into the newly loaded
  scheduler.
- Audit log only registers itself into the first scheduler
  implementation loaded.

Similarly, MySQL Enterprise Audit calls the `scheduler`
component at its deinitialization and unconfigures the
recurring flush that it has scheduled. It keeps an active
reference to the scheduler registration service until the
scheduled task is unregistered, ensuring that the
`scheduler` component cannot be unloaded
while there are active scheduled jobs. All of the results from
executing the scheduler and its tasks are written to the
server error log.

To schedule an audit log flush task:

1. Confirm that the `scheduler` component is
   loaded and enabled. The component is enabled
   (`ON`) by default (see
   [`component_scheduler.enabled`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_component_scheduler.enabled)).

   ```sql
   SELECT * FROM mysql.components;
   +--------------+--------------------+----------------------------+
   | component_id | component_group_id | component_urn              |
   +--------------+--------------------+----------------------------+
   |            1 |                  1 | file://component_scheduler |
   +--------------+--------------------+----------------------------+
   ```
2. Install the `audit_log` plugin, if it is
   not installed already (see
   [Section 8.4.5.2, “Installing or Uninstalling MySQL Enterprise Audit”](audit-log-installation.md "8.4.5.2 Installing or Uninstalling MySQL Enterprise Audit")).
3. Start the server using
   [`audit_log_flush_interval_seconds`](audit-log-reference.md#sysvar_audit_log_flush_interval_seconds)
   and set the value to a number greater than 59. The upper
   limit of the value varies by platform. For example, to
   configure the flush task to recur every two minutes:

   ```terminal
   $> mysqld --audit_log_flush_interval_seconds=120
   ```

   For more information, see the
   [`audit_log_flush_interval_seconds`](audit-log-reference.md#sysvar_audit_log_flush_interval_seconds)
   system variable.

##### Adding Query Statistics for Outlier Detection

In MySQL 8.0.30 and later, you can extend log files in JSON
format with optional data fields to show the query time, the
number of bytes sent and received, the number of rows returned
to the client, and the number of rows examined. This data is
available in the slow query log for qualifying queries, and in
the context of the audit log it similarly helps to detect
outliers for activity analysis. The extended data fields can
be added only when the audit log is in JSON format
([`audit_log_format=JSON`](audit-log-reference.md#sysvar_audit_log_format)),
which is not the default setting.

The query statistics are delivered to the audit log through
component services that you set up as an audit log filtering
function. The services are named
`mysql_audit_print_service_longlong_data_source`
and
`mysql_audit_print_service_double_data_source`.
You can choose either data type for each output item. For the
query time, `longlong` outputs the value in
microseconds, and `double` outputs the value
in seconds.

You add the query statistics using the
[`audit_log_filter_set_filter()`](audit-log-reference.md#function_audit-log-filter-set-filter)
audit log function, as the `service` element
of the JSON filtering syntax, as follows:

```sql
SELECT audit_log_filter_set_filter('QueryStatistics',
                                   '{ "filter": { "class": { "name": "general", "event": { "name": "status", "print" : '
                                   '{ "service": { "implementation": "mysql_server", "tag": "query_statistics", "element": [ '
                                   '{ "name": "query_time",     "type": "double" }, '
                                   '{ "name": "bytes_sent",     "type": "longlong" }, '
                                   '{ "name": "bytes_received", "type": "longlong" }, '
                                   '{ "name": "rows_sent",      "type": "longlong" }, '
                                   '{ "name": "rows_examined",  "type": "longlong" } ] } } } } } }');
```

For the `bytes_sent` and
`bytes_received` fields to be populated, the
system variable
[`log_slow_extra`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_log_slow_extra) must be set to
`ON`. If the system variable value is
`OFF`, a null value is written to the log
file for these fields.

If you want to stop collecting the query statistics, use the
[`audit_log_filter_set_filter()`](audit-log-reference.md#function_audit-log-filter-set-filter)
audit log function to remove the filter, for example:

```sql
SELECT audit_log_filter_remove_filter('QueryStatistics');
```

##### Compressing Audit Log Files

Audit log file compression can be enabled for any logging
format.

To configure audit log file compression, set the
[`audit_log_compression`](audit-log-reference.md#sysvar_audit_log_compression) system
variable at server startup. Permitted values are
`NONE` (no compression; the default) and
`GZIP` (GNU Zip compression).

If both compression and encryption are enabled, compression
occurs before encryption. To recover the original file
manually, first decrypt it, then uncompress it. See
[Manually Uncompressing and Decrypting Audit Log Files](audit-log-logging-configuration.md#audit-log-file-uncompression-decryption "Manually Uncompressing and Decrypting Audit Log Files").

##### Encrypting Audit Log Files

Audit log file encryption can be enabled for any logging
format. Encryption is based on user-defined passwords (with
the exception of the initial password that the audit log
plugin generates). To use this feature, the MySQL keyring must
be enabled because audit logging uses it for password storage.
Any keyring component or plugin can be used; for instructions,
see [Section 8.4.4, “The MySQL Keyring”](keyring.md "8.4.4 The MySQL Keyring").

To configure audit log file encryption, set the
[`audit_log_encryption`](audit-log-reference.md#sysvar_audit_log_encryption) system
variable at server startup. Permitted values are
`NONE` (no encryption; the default) and
`AES` (AES-256-CBC cipher encryption).

To set or get an encryption password at runtime, use these
audit log functions:

- To set the current encryption password, invoke
  [`audit_log_encryption_password_set()`](audit-log-reference.md#function_audit-log-encryption-password-set).
  This function stores the new password in the keyring. If
  encryption is enabled, it also performs a log file
  rotation operation that renames the current log file, and
  begins a new log file encrypted with the password. File
  renaming occurs according to the usual rules for automatic
  size-based log file rotation; see
  [Manual Audit Log File Rotation (Before MySQL 8.0.31)](audit-log-logging-configuration.md#audit-log-manual-rotation "Manual Audit Log File Rotation (Before MySQL 8.0.31)").

  If the
  [`audit_log_password_history_keep_days`](audit-log-reference.md#sysvar_audit_log_password_history_keep_days)
  system variable is nonzero, invoking
  [`audit_log_encryption_password_set()`](audit-log-reference.md#function_audit-log-encryption-password-set)
  also causes expiration of old archived audit log
  encryption passwords. For information about audit log
  password history, including password archiving and
  expiration, see the description of that variable.
- To get the current encryption password, invoke
  [`audit_log_encryption_password_get()`](audit-log-reference.md#function_audit-log-encryption-password-get)
  with no argument. To get a password by ID, pass an
  argument that specifies the keyring ID of the current
  password or an archived password.

  To determine which audit log keyring IDs exist, query the
  Performance Schema
  [`keyring_keys`](performance-schema-keyring-keys-table.md "29.12.18.2 The keyring_keys table") table:

  ```sql
  mysql> SELECT KEY_ID FROM performance_schema.keyring_keys
         WHERE KEY_ID LIKE 'audit_log%'
         ORDER BY KEY_ID;
  +-----------------------------+
  | KEY_ID                      |
  +-----------------------------+
  | audit_log-20190415T152248-1 |
  | audit_log-20190415T153507-1 |
  | audit_log-20190416T125122-1 |
  | audit_log-20190416T141608-1 |
  +-----------------------------+
  ```

For additional information about audit log encryption
functions, see [Audit Log Functions](audit-log-reference.md#audit-log-routines "Audit Log Functions").

When the audit log plugin initializes, if it finds that log
file encryption is enabled, it checks whether the keyring
contains an audit log encryption password. If not, the plugin
automatically generates a random initial encryption password
and stores it in the keyring. To discover this password,
invoke
[`audit_log_encryption_password_get()`](audit-log-reference.md#function_audit-log-encryption-password-get).

If both compression and encryption are enabled, compression
occurs before encryption. To recover the original file
manually, first decrypt it, then uncompress it. See
[Manually Uncompressing and Decrypting Audit Log Files](audit-log-logging-configuration.md#audit-log-file-uncompression-decryption "Manually Uncompressing and Decrypting Audit Log Files").

##### Manually Uncompressing and Decrypting Audit Log Files

Audit log files can be uncompressed and decrypted using
standard tools. This should be done only for log files that
have been closed (archived) and are no longer in use, not for
the log file that the audit log plugin is currently writing.
You can recognize archived log files because they have been
renamed by the audit log plugin to include a timestamp in the
file name just after the base name.

For this discussion, assume that
[`audit_log_file`](audit-log-reference.md#sysvar_audit_log_file) is set to
`audit.log`. In that case, an archived
audit log file has one of the names shown in the following
table.

| Enabled Features | Archived File Name |
| --- | --- |
| No compression or encryption | `audit.timestamp.log` |
| Compression | `audit.timestamp.log.gz` |
| Encryption | `audit.timestamp.log.pwd_id.enc` |
| Compression, encryption | `audit.timestamp.log.gz.pwd_id.enc` |

As discussed in [Naming Conventions for Audit Log Files](audit-log-logging-configuration.md#audit-log-file-name "Naming Conventions for Audit Log Files"),
*`pwd_id`* format is
*`pwd_timestamp-seq`*. Thus, the names
of archived encrypted log files actually contain two
timestamps. The first indicates file rotation time, and the
second indicates when the encryption password was created.

Consider the following set of archived encrypted log file
names:

```simple
audit.20190410T205827.log.20190403T185337-1.enc
audit.20190410T210243.log.20190403T185337-1.enc
audit.20190415T145309.log.20190414T223342-1.enc
audit.20190415T151322.log.20190414T223342-2.enc
```

Each file name has a unique rotation-time timestamp. By
contrast, the password timestamps are not unique:

- The first two files have the same password ID and sequence
  number (`20190403T185337-1`). They have
  the same encryption password.
- The second two files have the same password ID
  (`20190414T223342`) but different
  sequence numbers (`1`,
  `2`). These files have different
  encryption passwords.

To uncompress a compressed log file manually, use
**gunzip**, **gzip -d**, or
equivalent command. For example:

```terminal
gunzip -c audit.timestamp.log.gz > audit.timestamp.log
```

To decrypt an encrypted log file manually, use the
**openssl** command. For example:

```terminal
openssl enc -d -aes-256-cbc -pass pass:password -md sha256
    -in audit.timestamp.log.pwd_id.enc
    -out audit.timestamp.log
```

To execute that command, you must obtain
*`password`*, the encryption password.
To do this, use
[`audit_log_encryption_password_get()`](audit-log-reference.md#function_audit-log-encryption-password-get).
For example, if the audit log file name is
`audit.20190415T151322.log.20190414T223342-2.enc`,
the password ID is `20190414T223342-2` and
the keyring ID is
`audit-log-20190414T223342-2`. Retrieve the
keyring password like this:

```sql
SELECT audit_log_encryption_password_get('audit-log-20190414T223342-2');
```

If both compression and encryption are enabled for audit
logging, compression occurs before encryption. In this case,
the file name has `.gz` and
`.pwd_id.enc`
suffixes added, corresponding to the order in which those
operations occur. To recover the original file manually,
perform the operations in reverse. That is, first decrypt the
file, then uncompress it:

```terminal
openssl enc -d -aes-256-cbc -pass pass:password -md sha256
    -in audit.timestamp.log.gz.pwd_id.enc
    -out audit.timestamp.log.gz
gunzip -c audit.timestamp.log.gz > audit.timestamp.log
```

##### Audit Log File Encryption Prior to MySQL 8.0.17

This section covers the differences in audit log file
encryption capabilities prior to and as of MySQL 8.0.17, which
is when password history was implemented (which includes
password archiving and expiration). It also indicates how the
audit log plugin handles upgrades to MySQL 8.0.17 or higher
from versions lower than 8.0.17.

| Feature | Prior to MySQL 8.0.17 | As of MySQL 8.0.17 |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Number of passwords | Single password only | Multiple passwords permitted |
| Encrypted log file names | `.enc` suffix | `.pwd_id.enc` suffix |
| Password keyring ID | `audit_log` | `audit_log-pwd_id` |
| Password history | No | Yes |

Prior to MySQL 8.0.17, there is no password history, so
setting a new password makes the old password inaccessible,
rendering MySQL Enterprise Audit unable to read log files encrypted with
the old password. Should you anticipate a need to decrypt
those files manually, you must maintain a record of previous
passwords.

If audit log file encryption is enabled when you upgrade to
MySQL 8.0.17 or higher from a lower version, the audit log
plugin performs these upgrade actions:

- During plugin initialization, the plugin checks for an
  encryption password with a keyring ID of
  `audit_log`. If it finds one, the plugin
  duplicates the password using a keyring ID in
  `audit_log-pwd_id`
  format and uses it as the current encryption password.
  (For details about *`pwd_id`*
  syntax, see [Naming Conventions for Audit Log Files](audit-log-logging-configuration.md#audit-log-file-name "Naming Conventions for Audit Log Files").)
- Existing encrypted log files have a suffix of
  `.enc`. The plugin does not rename
  these to have a suffix of
  `.pwd_id.enc`,
  but can read them as long as the key with the ID of
  `audit_log` remains in the keyring.
- When password cleanup occurs, if the plugin expires any
  password with a keyring ID in
  `audit_log-pwd_id`
  format, it also expires the password with a keyring ID of
  `audit_log`, if it exists. (At this
  point, encrypted log files that have a suffix of
  `.enc` rather than
  `.pwd_id.enc`
  become unreadable by the plugin, so it is assumed that you
  no longer need them.)

##### Space Management of Audit Log Files

The audit log file has the potential to grow quite large and
consume a great deal of disk space. If you are collecting the
optional query time and size statistics, which are available
from MySQL 8.0.30, this increases the space requirements. The
query statistics are only supported with JSON format.

To manage the space used, employ these methods:

- Log file rotation. This involves rotating the current log
  file by renaming it, then opening a new current log file
  using the original name. Rotation can be performed
  manually, or configured to occur automatically.
- Pruning of rotated JSON-format log files, if automatic
  rotation is enabled. Pruning can be performed based on log
  file age (as of MySQL 8.0.24), or combined log file size
  (as of MySQL 8.0.26).

To configure audit log file space management, use the
following system variables:

- If
  [`audit_log_rotate_on_size`](audit-log-reference.md#sysvar_audit_log_rotate_on_size)
  is 0 (the default), automatic log file rotation is
  disabled.

  - No rotation occurs unless performed manually.
  - To rotate the current file, use one of the following
    methods:

    - Before MySQL 8.0.31, manually rename the file,
      then enable
      [`audit_log_flush`](audit-log-reference.md#sysvar_audit_log_flush)
      to close it and open a new current log file using
      the original name. This file rotation method and
      the
      [`audit_log_flush`](audit-log-reference.md#sysvar_audit_log_flush)
      variable are deprecated in MySQL 8.0.31.

      With this file rotation method, pruning of rotated
      JSON-format log files does not occur;
      [`audit_log_max_size`](audit-log-reference.md#sysvar_audit_log_max_size)
      and
      [`audit_log_prune_seconds`](audit-log-reference.md#sysvar_audit_log_prune_seconds)
      have no effect.
    - From MySQL 8.0.31, run `SELECT
      audit_log_rotate();` to rename the file
      and open a new audit log file using the original
      name.

      With this file rotation method, pruning of rotated
      JSON-format log files occurs if
      [`audit_log_max_size`](audit-log-reference.md#sysvar_audit_log_max_size)
      or
      [`audit_log_prune_seconds`](audit-log-reference.md#sysvar_audit_log_prune_seconds)
      has a value greater than 0.

    See [Manual Audit Log File Rotation (Before MySQL 8.0.31)](audit-log-logging-configuration.md#audit-log-manual-rotation "Manual Audit Log File Rotation (Before MySQL 8.0.31)").
- If
  [`audit_log_rotate_on_size`](audit-log-reference.md#sysvar_audit_log_rotate_on_size)
  is greater than 0, automatic audit log file rotation is
  enabled:

  - Automatic rotation occurs when a write to the current
    log file causes its size to exceed the
    [`audit_log_rotate_on_size`](audit-log-reference.md#sysvar_audit_log_rotate_on_size)
    value, as well as under certain other conditions; see
    [Automatic Audit Log File Rotation](audit-log-logging-configuration.md#audit-log-automatic-rotation "Automatic Audit Log File Rotation"). When
    automatic rotation occurs, the audit log plugin
    renames the current log file and opens a new current
    log file using the original name.
  - Pruning of rotated JSON-format log files occurs if
    [`audit_log_max_size`](audit-log-reference.md#sysvar_audit_log_max_size) or
    [`audit_log_prune_seconds`](audit-log-reference.md#sysvar_audit_log_prune_seconds)
    has a value greater than 0.
  - [`audit_log_flush`](audit-log-reference.md#sysvar_audit_log_flush) has
    no effect.

Note

For JSON-format log files, rotation also occurs when the
value of the
[`audit_log_format_unix_timestamp`](audit-log-reference.md#sysvar_audit_log_format_unix_timestamp)
system variable is changed at runtime. However, this does
not occur for space-management purposes, but rather so that,
for a given JSON-format log file, all records in the file
either do or do not include the `time`
field.

Note

Rotated (renamed) log files are not removed automatically.
For example, with size-based log file rotation, renamed log
files have unique names and accumulate indefinitely. They do
not rotate off the end of the name sequence. To avoid
excessive use of space:

- As of MySQL 8.0.24 (for JSON-format log files): Enable
  log file pruning as described in
  [Audit Log File Pruning](audit-log-logging-configuration.md#audit-log-pruning "Audit Log File Pruning").
- Otherwise (for non-JSON files, or prior to MySQL 8.0.24
  for all log formats): Remove old files periodically,
  backing them up first as necessary. If backed-up log
  files are encrypted, also back up the corresponding
  encryption passwords to a safe place, should you need to
  decrypt the files later.

The following sections describe log file rotation and pruning
in greater detail.

###### Manual Audit Log File Rotation (Before MySQL 8.0.31)

Note

From MySQL 8.0.31, the
[`audit_log_flush`](audit-log-reference.md#sysvar_audit_log_flush) variable
and this method of audit log file rotation are deprecated;
expect support to be removed in a future version of MySQL.

If [`audit_log_rotate_on_size`](audit-log-reference.md#sysvar_audit_log_rotate_on_size)
is 0 (the default), no log rotation occurs unless performed
manually. In this case, the audit log plugin closes and
reopens the log file when the
[`audit_log_flush`](audit-log-reference.md#sysvar_audit_log_flush) value changes
from disabled to enabled. Log file renaming must be done
externally to the server. Suppose that the log file name is
`audit.log` and you want to maintain the
three most recent log files, cycling through the names
`audit.log.1` through
`audit.log.3`. On Unix, perform rotation
manually like this:

1. From the command line, rename the current log files:

   ```terminal
   mv audit.log.2 audit.log.3
   mv audit.log.1 audit.log.2
   mv audit.log audit.log.1
   ```

   This strategy overwrites the current
   `audit.log.3` contents, placing a bound
   on the number of archived log files and the space they
   use.
2. At this point, the plugin is still writing to the current
   log file, which has been renamed to
   `audit.log.1`. Connect to the server
   and flush the log file so the plugin closes it and reopens
   a new `audit.log` file:

   ```sql
   SET GLOBAL audit_log_flush = ON;
   ```

   [`audit_log_flush`](audit-log-reference.md#sysvar_audit_log_flush) is
   special in that its value remains `OFF`
   so that you need not disable it explicitly before enabling
   it again to perform another flush.

Note

If compression or encryption are enabled, log file names
include suffixes that signify the enabled features, as well
as a password ID if encryption is enabled. If file names
include a password ID, be sure to retain the ID in the name
of any files you rename manually so that the password to use
for decryption operations can be determined.

Note

For JSON-format logging, renaming audit log files manually
makes them unavailable to the log-reading functions because
the audit log plugin can no longer determine that they are
part of the log file sequence (see
[Section 8.4.5.6, “Reading Audit Log Files”](audit-log-file-reading.md "8.4.5.6 Reading Audit Log Files")). Consider setting
[`audit_log_rotate_on_size`](audit-log-reference.md#sysvar_audit_log_rotate_on_size)
greater than 0 to use size-based rotation instead.

###### Manual Audit Log File Rotation (From MySQL 8.0.31)

If [`audit_log_rotate_on_size`](audit-log-reference.md#sysvar_audit_log_rotate_on_size)
is 0 (the default), no log rotation occurs unless performed
manually.

To rotate the audit log file manually, run `SELECT
audit_log_rotate();` to rename the current audit log
file and open a new audit log file. Files are renamed
according to the conventions described in
[Naming Conventions for Audit Log Files](audit-log-logging-configuration.md#audit-log-file-name "Naming Conventions for Audit Log Files").

The `AUDIT_ADMIN` privilege is
required to use the
[`audit_log_rotate()`](audit-log-reference.md#function_audit-log-rotate) function.

Managing the number of archived log files (the files that have
been renamed) and the space they use is a manual task that
involves removing archived audit log files that are no longer
needed from your file system.

The content of audit log files that are renamed using the
`audit_log_rotate()` function can be read by
[`audit_log_read()`](audit-log-reference.md#function_audit-log-read) function.

###### Automatic Audit Log File Rotation

If [`audit_log_rotate_on_size`](audit-log-reference.md#sysvar_audit_log_rotate_on_size)
is greater than 0, setting
[`audit_log_flush`](audit-log-reference.md#sysvar_audit_log_flush) has no
effect. Instead, whenever a write to the current log file
causes its size to exceed the
[`audit_log_rotate_on_size`](audit-log-reference.md#sysvar_audit_log_rotate_on_size)
value, the audit log plugin automatically renames the current
log file and opens a new current log file using the original
name.

Automatic size-based rotation also occurs under these
conditions:

- During plugin initialization, if a file with the audit log
  file name already exists (see
  [Naming Conventions for Audit Log Files](audit-log-logging-configuration.md#audit-log-file-name "Naming Conventions for Audit Log Files")).
- During plugin termination.
- When the
  [`audit_log_encryption_password_set()`](audit-log-reference.md#function_audit-log-encryption-password-set)
  function is called to set the encryption password, if
  encryption is enabled. (Rotation does not occur if
  encryption is disabled.)

The plugin renames the original file by inserting a timestamp
just after its base name. For example, if the file name is
`audit.log`, the plugin renames it to a
value such as `audit.20210115T140633.log`.
The timestamp is a UTC value in
`YYYYMMDDThhmmss`
format. For XML logging, the timestamp indicates rotation
time. For JSON logging, the timestamp is that of the last
event written to the file.

If log files are encrypted, the original file name already
contains a timestamp indicating the encryption password
creation time (see [Naming Conventions for Audit Log Files](audit-log-logging-configuration.md#audit-log-file-name "Naming Conventions for Audit Log Files")). In
this case, the file name after rotation contains two
timestamps. For example, an encrypted log file named
`audit.log.20210110T130749-1.enc` is
renamed to a value such as
`audit.20210115T140633.log.20210110T130749-1.enc`.

###### Audit Log File Pruning

The audit log plugin supports pruning of rotated JSON-format
audit log files, if automatic log file rotation is enabled. To
use this capability:

- Set `audit_log_format` to
  `JSON`. (In addition, consider also
  changing [`audit_log_file`](audit-log-reference.md#sysvar_audit_log_file);
  see [Selecting Audit Log File Format](audit-log-logging-configuration.md#audit-log-file-format "Selecting Audit Log File Format").)
- Set
  [`audit_log_rotate_on_size`](audit-log-reference.md#sysvar_audit_log_rotate_on_size)
  greater than 0 to specify the size in bytes at which
  automatic log file rotation occurs.
- By default, no pruning of automatically rotated
  JSON-format log files occurs. To enable pruning, set one
  of these system variables to a value greater than 0:

  - Set
    [`audit_log_max_size`](audit-log-reference.md#sysvar_audit_log_max_size)
    greater than 0 to specify the limit in bytes on the
    combined size of rotated log files above which the
    files become subject to pruning.
    [`audit_log_max_size`](audit-log-reference.md#sysvar_audit_log_max_size) is
    available as of MySQL 8.0.26.
  - Set
    [`audit_log_prune_seconds`](audit-log-reference.md#sysvar_audit_log_prune_seconds)
    greater than 0 to specify the number of seconds after
    which rotated log files become subject to pruning.
    [`audit_log_prune_seconds`](audit-log-reference.md#sysvar_audit_log_prune_seconds)
    is available as of MySQL 8.0.24.

  Nonzero values of
  [`audit_log_max_size`](audit-log-reference.md#sysvar_audit_log_max_size) take
  precedence over nonzero values of
  [`audit_log_prune_seconds`](audit-log-reference.md#sysvar_audit_log_prune_seconds).
  If both are set greater than 0 at plugin initialization, a
  warning is written to the server error log. If a client
  sets both greater than 0 at runtime, a warning is returned
  to the client.

  Note

  Warnings to the error log are written as Notes, which
  are information messages. To ensure that such messages
  appear in the error log and are not discarded, make sure
  that error-logging verbosity is sufficient to include
  information messages. For example, if you are using
  priority-based log filtering, as described in
  [Section 7.4.2.5, “Priority-Based Error Log Filtering (log\_filter\_internal)”](error-log-priority-based-filtering.md "7.4.2.5 Priority-Based Error Log Filtering (log_filter_internal)"),
  set the
  [`log_error_verbosity`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_log_error_verbosity)
  system variable to a value of 3.

Pruning of JSON-format log files, if enabled, occurs as
follows:

- When automatic rotation takes place; for the conditions
  under which this happens, see
  [Automatic Audit Log File Rotation](audit-log-logging-configuration.md#audit-log-automatic-rotation "Automatic Audit Log File Rotation").
- When the global
  [`audit_log_max_size`](audit-log-reference.md#sysvar_audit_log_max_size) or
  [`audit_log_prune_seconds`](audit-log-reference.md#sysvar_audit_log_prune_seconds)
  system variable is set at runtime.

For pruning based on combined rotated log file size, if the
combined size is greater than the limit specified by
[`audit_log_max_size`](audit-log-reference.md#sysvar_audit_log_max_size), the audit
log plugin removes the oldest files until their combined size
does not exceed the limit.

For pruning based on rotated log file age, the pruning point
is the current time minus the value of
[`audit_log_prune_seconds`](audit-log-reference.md#sysvar_audit_log_prune_seconds). In
rotated JSON-format log files, the timestamp part of each file
name indicates the timestamp of the last event written to the
file. The audit log plugin uses file name timestamps to
determine which files contain only events older than the
pruning point, and removes them.

##### Write Strategies for Audit Logging

The audit log plugin can use any of several strategies for log
writes. Regardless of strategy, logging occurs on a
best-effort basis, with no guarantee of consistency.

To specify a write strategy, set the
[`audit_log_strategy`](audit-log-reference.md#sysvar_audit_log_strategy) system
variable at server startup. By default, the strategy value is
`ASYNCHRONOUS` and the plugin logs
asynchronously to a buffer, waiting if the buffer is full. You
can tell the plugin not to wait
(`PERFORMANCE`) or to log synchronously,
either using file system caching
(`SEMISYNCHRONOUS`) or forcing output with a
`sync()` call after each write request
(`SYNCHRONOUS`).

For asynchronous write strategy, the
[`audit_log_buffer_size`](audit-log-reference.md#sysvar_audit_log_buffer_size) system
variable is the buffer size in bytes. Set this variable at
server startup to change the buffer size. The plugin uses a
single buffer, which it allocates when it initializes and
removes when it terminates. The plugin does not allocate this
buffer for nonasynchronous write strategies.

Asynchronous logging strategy has these characteristics:

- Minimal impact on server performance and scalability.
- Blocking of threads that generate audit events for the
  shortest possible time; that is, time to allocate the
  buffer plus time to copy the event to the buffer.
- Output goes to the buffer. A separate thread handles
  writes from the buffer to the log file.

With asynchronous logging, the integrity of the log file may
be compromised if a problem occurs during a write to the file
or if the plugin does not shut down cleanly (for example, in
the event that the server host exits unexpectedly). To reduce
this risk, set
[`audit_log_strategy`](audit-log-reference.md#sysvar_audit_log_strategy) to use
synchronous logging.

A disadvantage of `PERFORMANCE` strategy is
that it drops events when the buffer is full. For a heavily
loaded server, the audit log may have events missing.
