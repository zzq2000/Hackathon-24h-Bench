#### 29.12.2.3 The setup\_instruments Table

The [`setup_instruments`](performance-schema-setup-instruments-table.md "29.12.2.3 The setup_instruments Table") table lists
classes of instrumented objects for which events can be
collected:

Each instrument added to the source code provides a row for
the [`setup_instruments`](performance-schema-setup-instruments-table.md "29.12.2.3 The setup_instruments Table") table, even
when the instrumented code is not executed. When an instrument
is enabled and executed, instrumented instances are created,
which are visible in the
`xxx_instances`
tables, such as [`file_instances`](performance-schema-file-instances-table.md "29.12.3.2 The file_instances Table") or
[`rwlock_instances`](performance-schema-rwlock-instances-table.md "29.12.3.4 The rwlock_instances Table").

Modifications to most
[`setup_instruments`](performance-schema-setup-instruments-table.md "29.12.2.3 The setup_instruments Table") rows affect
monitoring immediately. For some instruments, modifications
are effective only at server startup; changing them at runtime
has no effect. This affects primarily mutexes, conditions, and
rwlocks in the server, although there may be other instruments
for which this is true.

For more information about the role of the
[`setup_instruments`](performance-schema-setup-instruments-table.md "29.12.2.3 The setup_instruments Table") table in event
filtering, see
[Section 29.4.3, “Event Pre-Filtering”](performance-schema-pre-filtering.md "29.4.3 Event Pre-Filtering").

The [`setup_instruments`](performance-schema-setup-instruments-table.md "29.12.2.3 The setup_instruments Table") table has
these columns:

- `NAME`

  The instrument name. Instrument names may have multiple
  parts and form a hierarchy, as discussed in
  [Section 29.6, “Performance Schema Instrument Naming Conventions”](performance-schema-instrument-naming.md "29.6 Performance Schema Instrument Naming Conventions").
  Events produced from execution of an instrument have an
  `EVENT_NAME` value that is taken from the
  instrument `NAME` value. (Events do not
  really have a “name,” but this provides a way
  to associate events with instruments.)
- `ENABLED`

  Whether the instrument is enabled. The value is
  `YES` or `NO`. A
  disabled instrument produces no events. This column can be
  modified, although setting `ENABLED` has
  no effect for instruments that have already been created.
- `TIMED`

  Whether the instrument is timed. The value is
  `YES`, `NO`, or
  `NULL`. This column can be modified,
  although setting `TIMED` has no effect
  for instruments that have already been created.

  A `TIMED` value of
  `NULL` indicates that the instrument does
  not support timing. For example, memory operations are not
  timed, so their `TIMED` column is
  `NULL`.

  Setting `TIMED` to
  `NULL` for an instrument that supports
  timing has no effect, as does setting
  `TIMED` to non-`NULL`
  for an instrument that does not support timing.

  If an enabled instrument is not timed, the instrument code
  is enabled, but the timer is not. Events produced by the
  instrument have `NULL` for the
  `TIMER_START`,
  `TIMER_END`, and
  `TIMER_WAIT` timer values. This in turn
  causes those values to be ignored when calculating the
  sum, minimum, maximum, and average time values in summary
  tables.
- `PROPERTIES`

  The instrument properties. This column uses the
  [`SET`](set.md "13.3.6 The SET Type") data type, so multiple
  flags from the following list can be set per instrument:

  - `controlled_by_default`: memory is
    collected by default for this instrument.
  - `global_statistics`: The instrument
    produces only global summaries. Summaries for finer
    levels are unavailable, such as per thread, account,
    user, or host. For example, most memory instruments
    produce only global summaries.
  - `mutable`: The instrument can
    “mutate” into a more specific one. This
    property applies only to statement instruments.
  - `progress`: The instrument is capable
    of reporting progress data. This property applies only
    to stage instruments.
  - `singleton`: The instrument has a
    single instance. For example, most global mutex locks
    in the server are singletons, so the corresponding
    instruments are as well.
  - `user`: The instrument is directly
    related to user workload (as opposed to system
    workload). One such instrument is
    `wait/io/socket/sql/client_connection`.
- `FLAGS`

  Whether the instrument's memory is controlled.

  This flag is supported for non-global memory instruments,
  only, and can be set or unset. For example:

  ```sql
                SQL> UPDATE PERFORMANCE_SCHEMA.SETUP_INTRUMENTS SET FLAGS="controlled" WHERE NAME='memory/sql/NET::buff';
  ```

  Note

  Attempting to set `FLAGS = controlled`
  on non-memory instruments, or on global memory
  instruments, fails silently.
- `VOLATILITY`

  The instrument volatility. Volatility values range from
  low to high. The values correspond to the
  `PSI_VOLATILITY_xxx`
  constants defined in the
  `mysql/psi/psi_base.h` header file:

  ```c
  #define PSI_VOLATILITY_UNKNOWN 0
  #define PSI_VOLATILITY_PERMANENT 1
  #define PSI_VOLATILITY_PROVISIONING 2
  #define PSI_VOLATILITY_DDL 3
  #define PSI_VOLATILITY_CACHE 4
  #define PSI_VOLATILITY_SESSION 5
  #define PSI_VOLATILITY_TRANSACTION 6
  #define PSI_VOLATILITY_QUERY 7
  #define PSI_VOLATILITY_INTRA_QUERY 8
  ```

  The `VOLATILITY` column is purely
  informational, to provide users (and the Performance
  Schema code) some hint about the instrument runtime
  behavior.

  Instruments with a low volatility index (PERMANENT = 1)
  are created once at server startup, and never destroyed or
  re-created during normal server operation. They are
  destroyed only during server shutdown.

  For example, the
  `wait/synch/mutex/pfs/LOCK_pfs_share_list`
  mutex is defined with a volatility of 1, which means it is
  created once. Possible overhead from the instrumentation
  itself (namely, mutex initialization) has no effect for
  this instrument then. Runtime overhead occurs only when
  locking or unlocking the mutex.

  Instruments with a higher volatility index (for example,
  SESSION = 5) are created and destroyed for every user
  session. For example, the
  `wait/synch/mutex/sql/THD::LOCK_query_plan`
  mutex is created each time a session connects, and
  destroyed when the session disconnects.

  This mutex is more sensitive to Performance Schema
  overhead, because overhead comes not only from the lock
  and unlock instrumentation, but also from mutex create and
  destroy instrumentation, which is executed more often.

  Another aspect of volatility concerns whether and when an
  update to the `ENABLED` column actually
  has some effect:

  - An update to `ENABLED` affects
    instrumented objects created subsequently, but has no
    effect on instruments already created.
  - Instruments that are more “volatile” use
    new settings from the
    [`setup_instruments`](performance-schema-setup-instruments-table.md "29.12.2.3 The setup_instruments Table") table
    sooner.

  For example, this statement does not affect the
  `LOCK_query_plan` mutex for existing
  sessions, but does have an effect on new sessions created
  subsequent to the update:

  ```sql
  UPDATE performance_schema.setup_instruments
  SET ENABLED=value
  WHERE NAME = 'wait/synch/mutex/sql/THD::LOCK_query_plan';
  ```

  This statement actually has no effect at all:

  ```sql
  UPDATE performance_schema.setup_instruments
  SET ENABLED=value
  WHERE NAME = 'wait/synch/mutex/pfs/LOCK_pfs_share_list';
  ```

  This mutex is permanent, and was created already before
  the update is executed. The mutex is never created again,
  so the `ENABLED` value in
  [`setup_instruments`](performance-schema-setup-instruments-table.md "29.12.2.3 The setup_instruments Table") is never
  used. To enable or disable this mutex, use the
  [`mutex_instances`](performance-schema-mutex-instances-table.md "29.12.3.3 The mutex_instances Table") table
  instead.
- `DOCUMENTATION`

  A string describing the instrument purpose. The value is
  `NULL` if no description is available.

The [`setup_instruments`](performance-schema-setup-instruments-table.md "29.12.2.3 The setup_instruments Table") table has
these indexes:

- Primary key on (`NAME`)

[`TRUNCATE TABLE`](truncate-table.md "15.1.37 TRUNCATE TABLE Statement") is not permitted
for the [`setup_instruments`](performance-schema-setup-instruments-table.md "29.12.2.3 The setup_instruments Table") table.

As of MySQL 8.0.27, to assist monitoring and troubleshooting,
the Performance Schema instrumentation is used to export names
of instrumented threads to the operating system. This enables
utilities that display thread names, such as debuggers and the
Unix **ps** command, to display distinct
[**mysqld**](mysqld.md "6.3.1 mysqld — The MySQL Server") thread names rather than
“mysqld”. This feature is supported only on
Linux, macOS, and Windows.

Suppose that [**mysqld**](mysqld.md "6.3.1 mysqld — The MySQL Server") is running on a system
that has a version of **ps** that supports this
invocation syntax:

```terminal
ps -C mysqld H -o "pid tid cmd comm"
```

Without export of thread names to the operating system, the
command displays output like this, where most
`COMMAND` values are
`mysqld`:

```none
  PID   TID CMD                         COMMAND
 1377  1377 /usr/sbin/mysqld            mysqld
 1377  1528 /usr/sbin/mysqld            mysqld
 1377  1529 /usr/sbin/mysqld            mysqld
 1377  1530 /usr/sbin/mysqld            mysqld
 1377  1531 /usr/sbin/mysqld            mysqld
 1377  1534 /usr/sbin/mysqld            mysqld
 1377  1535 /usr/sbin/mysqld            mysqld
 1377  1588 /usr/sbin/mysqld            xpl_worker1
 1377  1589 /usr/sbin/mysqld            xpl_worker0
 1377  1590 /usr/sbin/mysqld            mysqld
 1377  1594 /usr/sbin/mysqld            mysqld
 1377  1595 /usr/sbin/mysqld            mysqld
```

With export of thread names to the operating system, the
output looks like this, with threads having a name similar to
their instrument name:

```none
  PID   TID CMD                         COMMAND
27668 27668 /usr/sbin/mysqld            mysqld
27668 27671 /usr/sbin/mysqld            ib_io_ibuf
27668 27672 /usr/sbin/mysqld            ib_io_log
27668 27673 /usr/sbin/mysqld            ib_io_rd-1
27668 27674 /usr/sbin/mysqld            ib_io_rd-2
27668 27677 /usr/sbin/mysqld            ib_io_wr-1
27668 27678 /usr/sbin/mysqld            ib_io_wr-2
27668 27699 /usr/sbin/mysqld            xpl_worker-2
27668 27700 /usr/sbin/mysqld            xpl_accept-1
27668 27710 /usr/sbin/mysqld            evt_sched
27668 27711 /usr/sbin/mysqld            sig_handler
27668 27933 /usr/sbin/mysqld            connection
```

Different thread instances within the same class are numbered
to provide distinct names where that is feasible. Due to
constraints on name lengths with respect to potentially large
numbers of connections, connections are named simply
`connection`.
