#### 17.20.6.2 Adapting a memcached Application for the InnoDB memcached Plugin

Consider these aspects of MySQL and `InnoDB`
tables when adapting existing **memcached**
applications to use the `daemon_memcached`
plugin:

- If there are key values longer than a few bytes, it may be
  more efficient to use a numeric auto-increment column as the
  [primary key](glossary.md#glos_primary_key "primary key") of the
  `InnoDB` table, and to create a unique
  [secondary index](glossary.md#glos_secondary_index "secondary index")
  on the column that contains the **memcached**
  key values. This is because `InnoDB`
  performs best for large-scale insertions if primary key
  values are added in sorted order (as they are with
  auto-increment values). Primary key values are included in
  secondary indexes, which takes up unnecessary space if the
  primary key is a long string value.
- If you store several different classes of information using
  **memcached**, consider setting up a separate
  `InnoDB` table for each type of data.
  Define additional table identifiers in the
  `innodb_memcache.containers` table, and use
  the
  `@@table_id.key`
  notation to store and retrieve items from different tables.
  Physically dividing different types of information allows
  you tune the characteristics of each table for optimum space
  utilization, performance, and reliability. For example, you
  might enable
  [compression](glossary.md#glos_compression "compression") for a
  table that holds blog posts, but not for a table that holds
  thumbnail images. You might back up one table more
  frequently than another because it holds critical data. You
  might create additional
  [secondary
  indexes](glossary.md#glos_secondary_index "secondary index") on tables that are frequently used to
  generate reports using SQL.
- Preferably, configure a stable set of table definitions for
  use with the **daemon\_memcached** plugin, and
  leave the tables in place permanently. Changes to the
  `innodb_memcache.containers` table take
  effect the next time the
  `innodb_memcache.containers` table is
  queried. Entries in the containers table are processed at
  startup, and are consulted whenever an unrecognized table
  identifier (as defined by
  `containers.name`) is requested using
  `@@` notation. Thus, new entries are
  visible as soon as you use the associated table identifier,
  but changes to existing entries require a server restart
  before they take effect.
- When you use the default `innodb_only`
  caching policy, calls to `add()`,
  `set()`, `incr()`, and so
  on can succeed but still trigger debugging messages such as
  `while expecting 'STORED', got unexpected response
  'NOT_STORED`. Debug messages occur because new and
  updated values are sent directly to the
  `InnoDB` table without being saved in the
  memory cache, due to the `innodb_only`
  caching policy.
