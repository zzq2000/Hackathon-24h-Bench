### 2.10.2 Installing ActiveState Perl on Windows

On Windows, you should do the following to install the MySQL
`DBD` module with ActiveState Perl:

1. Get ActiveState Perl from
   <http://www.activestate.com/Products/ActivePerl/>
   and install it.
2. Open a console window.
3. If necessary, set the `HTTP_proxy` variable.
   For example, you might try a setting like this:

   ```terminal
   C:\> set HTTP_proxy=my.proxy.com:3128
   ```
4. Start the PPM program:

   ```terminal
   C:\> C:\perl\bin\ppm.pl
   ```
5. If you have not previously done so, install
   `DBI`:

   ```terminal
   ppm> install DBI
   ```
6. If this succeeds, run the following command:

   ```terminal
   ppm> install DBD-mysql
   ```

This procedure should work with ActiveState Perl 5.6 or higher.

If you cannot get the procedure to work, you should install the
ODBC driver instead and connect to the MySQL server through ODBC:

```perl
use DBI;
$dbh= DBI->connect("DBI:ODBC:$dsn",$user,$password) ||
  die "Got error $DBI::errstr when connecting to $dsn\n";
```
