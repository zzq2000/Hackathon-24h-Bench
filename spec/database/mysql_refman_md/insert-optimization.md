#### 10.2.5.1 Optimizing INSERT Statements

To optimize insert speed, combine many small operations into a
single large operation. Ideally, you make a single connection,
send the data for many new rows at once, and delay all index
updates and consistency checking until the very end.

The time required for inserting a row is determined by the
following factors, where the numbers indicate approximate
proportions:

- Connecting: (3)
- Sending query to server: (2)
- Parsing query: (2)
- Inserting row: (1 × size of row)
- Inserting indexes: (1 × number of indexes)
- Closing: (1)

This does not take into consideration the initial overhead to
open tables, which is done once for each concurrently running
query.

The size of the table slows down the insertion of indexes by
log *`N`*, assuming B-tree indexes.

You can use the following methods to speed up inserts:

- If you are inserting many rows from the same client at the
  same time, use [`INSERT`](insert.md "15.2.7 INSERT Statement")
  statements with multiple `VALUES` lists
  to insert several rows at a time. This is considerably
  faster (many times faster in some cases) than using
  separate single-row [`INSERT`](insert.md "15.2.7 INSERT Statement")
  statements. If you are adding data to a nonempty table,
  you can tune the
  [`bulk_insert_buffer_size`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_bulk_insert_buffer_size)
  variable to make data insertion even faster. See
  [Section 7.1.8, “Server System Variables”](server-system-variables.md "7.1.8 Server System Variables").
- When loading a table from a text file, use
  [`LOAD DATA`](load-data.md "15.2.9 LOAD DATA Statement"). This is usually
  20 times faster than using
  [`INSERT`](insert.md "15.2.7 INSERT Statement") statements. See
  [Section 15.2.9, “LOAD DATA Statement”](load-data.md "15.2.9 LOAD DATA Statement").
- Take advantage of the fact that columns have default
  values. Insert values explicitly only when the value to be
  inserted differs from the default. This reduces the
  parsing that MySQL must do and improves the insert speed.

- See [Section 10.6.2, “Bulk Data Loading for MyISAM Tables”](optimizing-myisam-bulk-data-loading.md "10.6.2 Bulk Data Loading for MyISAM Tables")
