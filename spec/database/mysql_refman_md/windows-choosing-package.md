### 2.3.2 Choosing an Installation Package

For MySQL 8.0, there are multiple installation
package formats to choose from when installing MySQL on Windows.
The package formats described in this section are:

- [MySQL Installer](windows-choosing-package.md#windows-choosing-package-mysql-installer "MySQL Installer")
- [MySQL noinstall ZIP Archives](windows-choosing-package.md#windows-choosing-package-no-zip "MySQL noinstall ZIP Archives")
- [MySQL Docker Images](windows-choosing-package.md#windows-choosing-package-docker "MySQL Docker Images")

Program Database (PDB) files (with file name extension
`pdb`) provide information for debugging your
MySQL installation in the event of a problem. These files are
included in ZIP Archive distributions (but not MSI distributions)
of MySQL.

#### MySQL Installer

This package has a file name similar to
`mysql-installer-community-8.0.45.0.msi`
or
`mysql-installer-commercial-8.0.45.0.msi`,
and utilizes MSIs to install MySQL server and other products
automatically. MySQL Installer downloads and applies updates to itself, and
to each of the installed products. It also configures the
installed MySQL server (including a sandbox InnoDB cluster test
setup) and MySQL Router. MySQL Installer is recommended for most users.

MySQL Installer can install and manage (add, modify, upgrade, and remove)
many other MySQL products, including:

- Applications – MySQL Workbench, MySQL for Visual Studio, MySQL Shell, and
  MySQL Router (see
  <https://dev.mysql.com/doc/mysql-compat-matrix/en/>)
- Connectors – MySQL Connector/C++, MySQL Connector/NET, Connector/ODBC, MySQL Connector/Python, MySQL Connector/J,
  MySQL Connector/Node.js
- Documentation – MySQL Manual (PDF format), samples and
  examples

MySQL Installer operates on all MySQL supported versions of Windows (see
<https://www.mysql.com/support/supportedplatforms/database.html>).

Note

Because MySQL Installer is not a native component of Microsoft Windows
and depends on .NET, it does not work with minimal
installation options like the Server Core version of Windows
Server.

For instructions on how to install MySQL using MySQL Installer, see
[Section 2.3.3, “MySQL Installer for Windows”](mysql-installer.md "2.3.3 MySQL Installer for Windows").

#### MySQL noinstall ZIP Archives

These packages contain the files found in the complete MySQL
Server installation package, with the exception of the GUI. This
format does not include an automated installer, and must be
manually installed and configured.

The `noinstall` ZIP archives are split into two
separate compressed files. The main package is named
`mysql-VERSION-winx64.zip`.
This contains the components needed to use MySQL on your system.
The optional MySQL test suite, MySQL benchmark suite, and
debugging binaries/information components (including PDB files)
are in a separate compressed file named
`mysql-VERSION-winx64-debug-test.zip`.

If you choose to install a `noinstall` ZIP
archive, see [Section 2.3.4, “Installing MySQL on Microsoft Windows Using a
`noinstall` ZIP Archive”](windows-install-archive.md "2.3.4 Installing MySQL on Microsoft Windows Using a noinstall ZIP Archive").

#### MySQL Docker Images

For information on using the MySQL Docker images provided by
Oracle on Windows platform, see
[Section 2.5.6.3, “Deploying MySQL on Windows and Other Non-Linux Platforms with Docker”](deploy-mysql-nonlinux-docker.md "2.5.6.3 Deploying MySQL on Windows and Other Non-Linux Platforms with Docker").

Warning

The MySQL Docker images provided by Oracle are built
specifically for Linux platforms. Other platforms are not
supported, and users running the MySQL Docker images from
Oracle on them are doing so at their own risk.
