#### 7.6.6.1 Version Tokens Elements

Version Tokens is based on a plugin library that implements
these elements:

- A server-side plugin named `version_tokens`
  holds the list of version tokens associated with the server
  and subscribes to notifications for statement execution
  events. The `version_tokens` plugin uses
  the [audit plugin
  API](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/extending-mysql/8.0/en/plugin-types.html#audit-plugin-type) to monitor incoming statements from clients and
  matches each client's session-specific version token list
  against the server version token list. If there is a match,
  the plugin lets the statement through and the server
  continues to process it. Otherwise, the plugin returns an
  error to the client and the statement fails.
- A set of loadable functions provides an SQL-level API for
  manipulating and inspecting the list of server version
  tokens maintained by the plugin. The
  [`VERSION_TOKEN_ADMIN`](privileges-provided.md#priv_version-token-admin) privilege
  (or the deprecated [`SUPER`](privileges-provided.md#priv_super)
  privilege) is required to call any of the Version Token
  functions.
- When the `version_tokens` plugin loads, it
  defines the
  [`VERSION_TOKEN_ADMIN`](privileges-provided.md#priv_version-token-admin) dynamic
  privilege. This privilege can be granted to users of the
  functions.
- A system variable enables clients to specify the list of
  version tokens that register the required server state. If
  the server has a different state when a client sends a
  statement, the client receives an error.
