#### 26.2.3.1 RANGE COLUMNS partitioning

Range columns partitioning is similar to range partitioning,
but enables you to define partitions using ranges based on
multiple column values. In addition, you can define the ranges
using columns of types other than integer types.

`RANGE COLUMNS` partitioning differs
significantly from `RANGE` partitioning in
the following ways:

- `RANGE COLUMNS` does not accept
  expressions, only names of columns.
- `RANGE COLUMNS` accepts a list of one or
  more columns.

  `RANGE COLUMNS` partitions are based on
  comparisons between
  tuples (lists of
  column values) rather than comparisons between scalar
  values. Placement of rows in `RANGE
  COLUMNS` partitions is also based on comparisons
  between tuples; this is discussed further later in this
  section.
- `RANGE COLUMNS` partitioning columns are
  not restricted to integer columns; string,
  [`DATE`](datetime.md "13.2.2 The DATE, DATETIME, and TIMESTAMP Types") and
  [`DATETIME`](datetime.md "13.2.2 The DATE, DATETIME, and TIMESTAMP Types") columns can also
  be used as partitioning columns. (See
  [Section 26.2.3, “COLUMNS Partitioning”](partitioning-columns.md "26.2.3 COLUMNS Partitioning"), for details.)

The basic syntax for creating a table partitioned by
`RANGE COLUMNS` is shown here:

```sql
CREATE TABLE table_name
PARTITION BY RANGE COLUMNS(column_list) (
    PARTITION partition_name VALUES LESS THAN (value_list)[,
    PARTITION partition_name VALUES LESS THAN (value_list)][,
    ...]
)

column_list:
    column_name[, column_name][, ...]

value_list:
    value[, value][, ...]
```

Note

Not all [`CREATE TABLE`](create-table.md "15.1.20 CREATE TABLE Statement") options
that can be used when creating partitioned tables are shown
here. For complete information, see
[Section 15.1.20, “CREATE TABLE Statement”](create-table.md "15.1.20 CREATE TABLE Statement").

In the syntax just shown,
*`column_list`* is a list of one or
more columns (sometimes called a
partitioning column
list), and *`value_list`* is
a list of values (that is, it is a
partition definition value
list). A *`value_list`* must
be supplied for each partition definition, and each
*`value_list`* must have the same
number of values as the *`column_list`*
has columns. Generally speaking, if you use
*`N`* columns in the
`COLUMNS` clause, then each `VALUES
LESS THAN` clause must also be supplied with a list
of *`N`* values.

The elements in the partitioning column list and in the value
list defining each partition must occur in the same order. In
addition, each element in the value list must be of the same
data type as the corresponding element in the column list.
However, the order of the column names in the partitioning
column list and the value lists does not have to be the same
as the order of the table column definitions in the main part
of the [`CREATE TABLE`](create-table.md "15.1.20 CREATE TABLE Statement") statement.
As with table partitioned by `RANGE`, you can
use `MAXVALUE` to represent a value such that
any legal value inserted into a given column is always less
than this value. Here is an example of a
[`CREATE TABLE`](create-table.md "15.1.20 CREATE TABLE Statement") statement that
helps to illustrate all of these points:

```sql
mysql> CREATE TABLE rcx (
    ->     a INT,
    ->     b INT,
    ->     c CHAR(3),
    ->     d INT
    -> )
    -> PARTITION BY RANGE COLUMNS(a,d,c) (
    ->     PARTITION p0 VALUES LESS THAN (5,10,'ggg'),
    ->     PARTITION p1 VALUES LESS THAN (10,20,'mmm'),
    ->     PARTITION p2 VALUES LESS THAN (15,30,'sss'),
    ->     PARTITION p3 VALUES LESS THAN (MAXVALUE,MAXVALUE,MAXVALUE)
    -> );
Query OK, 0 rows affected (0.15 sec)
```

Table `rcx` contains the columns
`a`, `b`,
`c`, `d`. The partitioning
column list supplied to the `COLUMNS` clause
uses 3 of these columns, in the order `a`,
`d`, `c`. Each value list
used to define a partition contains 3 values in the same
order; that is, each value list tuple has the form
(`INT`, `INT`,
`CHAR(3)`), which corresponds to the data
types used by columns `a`,
`d`, and `c` (in that
order).

Placement of rows into partitions is determined by comparing
the tuple from a row to be inserted that matches the column
list in the `COLUMNS` clause with the tuples
used in the `VALUES LESS THAN` clauses to
define partitions of the table. Because we are comparing
tuples (that is, lists or sets of values) rather than scalar
values, the semantics of `VALUES LESS THAN`
as used with `RANGE COLUMNS` partitions
differs somewhat from the case with simple
`RANGE` partitions. In
`RANGE` partitioning, a row generating an
expression value that is equal to a limiting value in a
`VALUES LESS THAN` is never placed in the
corresponding partition; however, when using `RANGE
COLUMNS` partitioning, it is sometimes possible for a
row whose partitioning column list's first element is
equal in value to the that of the first element in a
`VALUES LESS THAN` value list to be placed in
the corresponding partition.

Consider the `RANGE` partitioned table
created by this statement:

```sql
CREATE TABLE r1 (
    a INT,
    b INT
)
PARTITION BY RANGE (a)  (
    PARTITION p0 VALUES LESS THAN (5),
    PARTITION p1 VALUES LESS THAN (MAXVALUE)
);
```

If we insert 3 rows into this table such that the column value
for `a` is `5` for each row,
all 3 rows are stored in partition `p1`
because the `a` column value is in each case
not less than 5, as we can see by executing the proper query
against the Information Schema
[`PARTITIONS`](information-schema-partitions-table.md "28.3.21 The INFORMATION_SCHEMA PARTITIONS Table") table:

```sql
mysql> INSERT INTO r1 VALUES (5,10), (5,11), (5,12);
Query OK, 3 rows affected (0.00 sec)
Records: 3  Duplicates: 0  Warnings: 0

mysql> SELECT PARTITION_NAME, TABLE_ROWS
    ->     FROM INFORMATION_SCHEMA.PARTITIONS
    ->     WHERE TABLE_NAME = 'r1';
+----------------+------------+
| PARTITION_NAME | TABLE_ROWS |
+----------------+------------+
| p0             |          0 |
| p1             |          3 |
+----------------+------------+
2 rows in set (0.00 sec)
```

Now consider a similar table `rc1` that uses
`RANGE COLUMNS` partitioning with both
columns `a` and `b`
referenced in the `COLUMNS` clause, created
as shown here:

```sql
CREATE TABLE rc1 (
    a INT,
    b INT
)
PARTITION BY RANGE COLUMNS(a, b) (
    PARTITION p0 VALUES LESS THAN (5, 12),
    PARTITION p3 VALUES LESS THAN (MAXVALUE, MAXVALUE)
);
```

If we insert exactly the same rows into `rc1`
as we just inserted into `r1`, the
distribution of the rows is quite different:

```sql
mysql> INSERT INTO rc1 VALUES (5,10), (5,11), (5,12);
Query OK, 3 rows affected (0.00 sec)
Records: 3  Duplicates: 0  Warnings: 0

mysql> SELECT PARTITION_NAME, TABLE_ROWS
    ->     FROM INFORMATION_SCHEMA.PARTITIONS
    ->     WHERE TABLE_NAME = 'rc1';
+----------------+------------+
| PARTITION_NAME | TABLE_ROWS |
+----------------+------------+
| p0             |          2 |
| p3             |          1 |
+----------------+------------+
2 rows in set (0.00 sec)
```

This is because we are comparing rows rather than scalar
values. We can compare the row values inserted with the
limiting row value from the `VALUES THAN LESS
THAN` clause used to define partition
`p0` in table `rc1`, like
this:

```sql
mysql> SELECT (5,10) < (5,12), (5,11) < (5,12), (5,12) < (5,12);
+-----------------+-----------------+-----------------+
| (5,10) < (5,12) | (5,11) < (5,12) | (5,12) < (5,12) |
+-----------------+-----------------+-----------------+
|               1 |               1 |               0 |
+-----------------+-----------------+-----------------+
1 row in set (0.00 sec)
```

The 2 tuples `(5,10)` and
`(5,11)` evaluate as less than
`(5,12)`, so they are stored in partition
`p0`. Since 5 is not less than 5 and 12 is
not less than 12, `(5,12)` is considered not
less than `(5,12)`, and is stored in
partition `p1`.

The [`SELECT`](select.md "15.2.13 SELECT Statement") statement in the
preceding example could also have been written using explicit
row constructors, like this:

```sql
SELECT ROW(5,10) < ROW(5,12), ROW(5,11) < ROW(5,12), ROW(5,12) < ROW(5,12);
```

For more information about the use of row constructors in
MySQL, see [Section 15.2.15.5, “Row Subqueries”](row-subqueries.md "15.2.15.5 Row Subqueries").

For a table partitioned by `RANGE COLUMNS`
using only a single partitioning column, the storing of rows
in partitions is the same as that of an equivalent table that
is partitioned by `RANGE`. The following
`CREATE TABLE` statement creates a table
partitioned by `RANGE COLUMNS` using 1
partitioning column:

```sql
CREATE TABLE rx (
    a INT,
    b INT
)
PARTITION BY RANGE COLUMNS (a)  (
    PARTITION p0 VALUES LESS THAN (5),
    PARTITION p1 VALUES LESS THAN (MAXVALUE)
);
```

If we insert the rows `(5,10)`,
`(5,11)`, and `(5,12)` into
this table, we can see that their placement is the same as it
is for the table `r` we created and populated
earlier:

```sql
mysql> INSERT INTO rx VALUES (5,10), (5,11), (5,12);
Query OK, 3 rows affected (0.00 sec)
Records: 3  Duplicates: 0  Warnings: 0

mysql> SELECT PARTITION_NAME,TABLE_ROWS
    ->     FROM INFORMATION_SCHEMA.PARTITIONS
    ->     WHERE TABLE_NAME = 'rx';
+----------------+------------+
| PARTITION_NAME | TABLE_ROWS |
+----------------+------------+
| p0             |          0 |
| p1             |          3 |
+----------------+------------+
2 rows in set (0.00 sec)
```

It is also possible to create tables partitioned by
`RANGE COLUMNS` where limiting values for one
or more columns are repeated in successive partition
definitions. You can do this as long as the tuples of column
values used to define the partitions are strictly increasing.
For example, each of the following [`CREATE
TABLE`](create-table.md "15.1.20 CREATE TABLE Statement") statements is valid:

```sql
CREATE TABLE rc2 (
    a INT,
    b INT
)
PARTITION BY RANGE COLUMNS(a,b) (
    PARTITION p0 VALUES LESS THAN (0,10),
    PARTITION p1 VALUES LESS THAN (10,20),
    PARTITION p2 VALUES LESS THAN (10,30),
    PARTITION p3 VALUES LESS THAN (MAXVALUE,MAXVALUE)
 );

CREATE TABLE rc3 (
    a INT,
    b INT
)
PARTITION BY RANGE COLUMNS(a,b) (
    PARTITION p0 VALUES LESS THAN (0,10),
    PARTITION p1 VALUES LESS THAN (10,20),
    PARTITION p2 VALUES LESS THAN (10,30),
    PARTITION p3 VALUES LESS THAN (10,35),
    PARTITION p4 VALUES LESS THAN (20,40),
    PARTITION p5 VALUES LESS THAN (MAXVALUE,MAXVALUE)
 );
```

The following statement also succeeds, even though it might
appear at first glance that it would not, since the limiting
value of column `b` is 25 for partition
`p0` and 20 for partition
`p1`, and the limiting value of column
`c` is 100 for partition
`p1` and 50 for partition
`p2`:

```sql
CREATE TABLE rc4 (
    a INT,
    b INT,
    c INT
)
PARTITION BY RANGE COLUMNS(a,b,c) (
    PARTITION p0 VALUES LESS THAN (0,25,50),
    PARTITION p1 VALUES LESS THAN (10,20,100),
    PARTITION p2 VALUES LESS THAN (10,30,50),
    PARTITION p3 VALUES LESS THAN (MAXVALUE,MAXVALUE,MAXVALUE)
 );
```

When designing tables partitioned by `RANGE
COLUMNS`, you can always test successive partition
definitions by comparing the desired tuples using the
[**mysql**](mysql.md "6.5.1 mysql — The MySQL Command-Line Client") client, like this:

```sql
mysql> SELECT (0,25,50) < (10,20,100), (10,20,100) < (10,30,50);
+-------------------------+--------------------------+
| (0,25,50) < (10,20,100) | (10,20,100) < (10,30,50) |
+-------------------------+--------------------------+
|                       1 |                        1 |
+-------------------------+--------------------------+
1 row in set (0.00 sec)
```

If a [`CREATE TABLE`](create-table.md "15.1.20 CREATE TABLE Statement") statement
contains partition definitions that are not in strictly
increasing order, it fails with an error, as shown in this
example:

```sql
mysql> CREATE TABLE rcf (
    ->     a INT,
    ->     b INT,
    ->     c INT
    -> )
    -> PARTITION BY RANGE COLUMNS(a,b,c) (
    ->     PARTITION p0 VALUES LESS THAN (0,25,50),
    ->     PARTITION p1 VALUES LESS THAN (20,20,100),
    ->     PARTITION p2 VALUES LESS THAN (10,30,50),
    ->     PARTITION p3 VALUES LESS THAN (MAXVALUE,MAXVALUE,MAXVALUE)
    ->  );
ERROR 1493 (HY000): VALUES LESS THAN value must be strictly increasing for each partition
```

When you get such an error, you can deduce which partition
definitions are invalid by making “less than”
comparisons between their column lists. In this case, the
problem is with the definition of partition
`p2` because the tuple used to define it is
not less than the tuple used to define partition
`p3`, as shown here:

```sql
mysql> SELECT (0,25,50) < (20,20,100), (20,20,100) < (10,30,50);
+-------------------------+--------------------------+
| (0,25,50) < (20,20,100) | (20,20,100) < (10,30,50) |
+-------------------------+--------------------------+
|                       1 |                        0 |
+-------------------------+--------------------------+
1 row in set (0.00 sec)
```

It is also possible for `MAXVALUE` to appear
for the same column in more than one `VALUES LESS
THAN` clause when using `RANGE
COLUMNS`. However, the limiting values for individual
columns in successive partition definitions should otherwise
be increasing, there should be no more than one partition
defined where `MAXVALUE` is used as the upper
limit for all column values, and this partition definition
should appear last in the list of `PARTITION ...
VALUES LESS THAN` clauses. In addition, you cannot
use `MAXVALUE` as the limiting value for the
first column in more than one partition definition.

As stated previously, it is also possible with `RANGE
COLUMNS` partitioning to use non-integer columns as
partitioning columns. (See
[Section 26.2.3, “COLUMNS Partitioning”](partitioning-columns.md "26.2.3 COLUMNS Partitioning"), for a complete listing
of these.) Consider a table named `employees`
(which is not partitioned), created using the following
statement:

```sql
CREATE TABLE employees (
    id INT NOT NULL,
    fname VARCHAR(30),
    lname VARCHAR(30),
    hired DATE NOT NULL DEFAULT '1970-01-01',
    separated DATE NOT NULL DEFAULT '9999-12-31',
    job_code INT NOT NULL,
    store_id INT NOT NULL
);
```

Using `RANGE COLUMNS` partitioning, you can
create a version of this table that stores each row in one of
four partitions based on the employee's last name, like
this:

```sql
CREATE TABLE employees_by_lname (
    id INT NOT NULL,
    fname VARCHAR(30),
    lname VARCHAR(30),
    hired DATE NOT NULL DEFAULT '1970-01-01',
    separated DATE NOT NULL DEFAULT '9999-12-31',
    job_code INT NOT NULL,
    store_id INT NOT NULL
)
PARTITION BY RANGE COLUMNS (lname)  (
    PARTITION p0 VALUES LESS THAN ('g'),
    PARTITION p1 VALUES LESS THAN ('m'),
    PARTITION p2 VALUES LESS THAN ('t'),
    PARTITION p3 VALUES LESS THAN (MAXVALUE)
);
```

Alternatively, you could cause the
`employees` table as created previously to be
partitioned using this scheme by executing the following
[`ALTER
TABLE`](alter-table-partition-operations.md "15.1.9.1 ALTER TABLE Partition Operations") statement:

```sql
ALTER TABLE employees PARTITION BY RANGE COLUMNS (lname)  (
    PARTITION p0 VALUES LESS THAN ('g'),
    PARTITION p1 VALUES LESS THAN ('m'),
    PARTITION p2 VALUES LESS THAN ('t'),
    PARTITION p3 VALUES LESS THAN (MAXVALUE)
);
```

Note

Because different character sets and collations have
different sort orders, the character sets and collations in
use may effect which partition of a table partitioned by
`RANGE COLUMNS` a given row is stored in
when using string columns as partitioning columns. In
addition, changing the character set or collation for a
given database, table, or column after such a table is
created may cause changes in how rows are distributed. For
example, when using a case-sensitive collation,
`'and'` sorts before
`'Andersen'`, but when using a collation
that is case-insensitive, the reverse is true.

For information about how MySQL handles character sets and
collations, see [Chapter 12, *Character Sets, Collations, Unicode*](charset.md "Chapter 12 Character Sets, Collations, Unicode").

Similarly, you can cause the `employees`
table to be partitioned in such a way that each row is stored
in one of several partitions based on the decade in which the
corresponding employee was hired using the
[`ALTER
TABLE`](alter-table-partition-operations.md "15.1.9.1 ALTER TABLE Partition Operations") statement shown here:

```sql
ALTER TABLE employees PARTITION BY RANGE COLUMNS (hired)  (
    PARTITION p0 VALUES LESS THAN ('1970-01-01'),
    PARTITION p1 VALUES LESS THAN ('1980-01-01'),
    PARTITION p2 VALUES LESS THAN ('1990-01-01'),
    PARTITION p3 VALUES LESS THAN ('2000-01-01'),
    PARTITION p4 VALUES LESS THAN ('2010-01-01'),
    PARTITION p5 VALUES LESS THAN (MAXVALUE)
);
```

See [Section 15.1.20, “CREATE TABLE Statement”](create-table.md "15.1.20 CREATE TABLE Statement"), for additional information
about `PARTITION BY RANGE COLUMNS` syntax.
