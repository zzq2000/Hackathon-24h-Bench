#### 20.5.1.1 Changing the Primary

This section explains how to change which member of a
single-primary group is the primary, using the
[`group_replication_set_as_primary()`](group-replication-functions-for-new-primary.md#function_group-replication-set-as-primary)
function, which can be can be run on any member of the group.
When this is done, the current primary becomes a read-only
secondary, and the specified group member becomes the read-write
primary; this replaces the usual primary election process as
described in
[Section 20.1.3.1, “Single-Primary Mode”](group-replication-single-primary-mode.md "20.1.3.1 Single-Primary Mode").

If a standard source-to-replica replication channel is running
on the existing primary member in addition to the Group
Replication channels, you must stop that replication channel
before you can change the primary member. You can identify the
current primary using the `MEMBER_ROLE` column
in the Performance Schema table
[`replication_group_members`](performance-schema-replication-group-members-table.md "29.12.11.16 The replication_group_members Table"), or the
[`group_replication_primary_member`](group-replication-status-variables.md#statvar_group_replication_primary_member)
status variable.

If all members are not running the same MySQL Server version,
you can specify a new primary member that is running the lowest
MySQL Server version in the group only. This safeguard is
applied to ensure the group maintains compatibility with new
functions. This is recommended for all MySQL versions, and
enforced beginning with MySQL 8.0.17.

Any uncommitted transactions that the group is waiting on must
be committed, rolled back, or terminated before the operation
can complete. Before MySQL 8.0.29, the function waits for all
active transactions on the existing primary to end, including
incoming transactions that are started after the function is
used. As of MySQL 8.0.29, you can specify a timeout from 1 to
3600 seconds (60 minutes) for transactions that are running when
you use the function. For the timeout to work, all members of
the group must be at MySQL 8.0.29 or higher. Specify 0 for no
timeout (or do not specify a timeout value), in which case the
group waits indefinitely. If you do not set the timeout, there
is no upper limit to the wait time, and new transactions can
start during that time.

When the timeout expires, for any transactions that did not yet
reach their commit phase, the client session is disconnected so
that the transaction does not proceed. Transactions that reached
their commit phase are allowed to complete. When you set a
timeout, it also prevents new transactions starting on the
primary from that point on. Explicitly defined transactions
(with a `START TRANSACTION` or
`BEGIN` statement) are subject to the timeout,
disconnection, and incoming transaction blocking even if they do
not modify any data. To allow inspection of the primary while
the function is operating, single statements that do not modify
data, as listed in
[Permitted Queries Under Consistency Rules](group-replication-configuring-consistency-guarantees.md#group-replication-nonblocking "Permitted Queries Under Consistency Rules"), are permitted
to proceed.

Pass in the [`server_uuid`](replication-options.md#sysvar_server_uuid) of the
member which you want to become the new primary of the group by
issuing the following statement:

```sql
SELECT group_replication_set_as_primary(member_uuid);
```

In MySQL 8.0.29 and later, you can add a timeout, as shown here:

```sql
SELECT group_replication_set_as_primary(‘00371d66-3c45-11ea-804b-080027337932’, 300)
```

To check the status of the timeout, use the
`PROCESSLIST_INFO` column in the Performance
Schema [`threads`](performance-schema-threads-table.md "29.12.21.8 The threads Table") table, like this:

```sql
mysql> SELECT NAME, PROCESSLIST_INFO FROM performance_schema.threads
    -> WHERE NAME="thread/group_rpl/THD_transaction_monitor"\G
*************************** 1. row ***************************
            NAME: thread/group_rpl/THD_transaction_monitor
PROCESSLIST_INFO: Group replication transaction monitor: Stopped client connections
```

The status shows when the transaction monitoring thread has been
created, when new transactions have been stopped, when the
client connections with uncommitted transactions have been
disconnected, and finally, when the process is complete and new
transactions are allowed again.

While the action runs, you can check its progress by issuing the
statement shown here:

```sql
mysql> SELECT event_name, work_completed, work_estimated
    -> FROM performance_schema.events_stages_current
    -> WHERE event_name LIKE "%stage/group_rpl%"\G
*************************** 1. row ***************************
    EVENT_NAME: stage/group_rpl/Primary Election: Waiting for members to turn on super_read_only
WORK_COMPLETED: 3
WORK_ESTIMATED: 5
```
