#### 2.3.3.5 MySQL Installer Console Reference

[**MySQLInstallerConsole.exe**](MySQLInstallerConsole.md "2.3.3.5 MySQL Installer Console Reference") provides command-line
functionality that is similar to MySQL Installer. This reference includes:

- [MySQL Product Names](MySQLInstallerConsole.md#mi-console-product-names "MySQL Product Names")
- [Command Syntax](MySQLInstallerConsole.md#mi-console-command-syntax "Command Syntax")
- [Command Actions](MySQLInstallerConsole.md#mi-console-actions "Command Actions")

The console is installed when MySQL Installer is initially executed and then
available within the `MySQL Installer for
Windows` directory. By default, the directory location
is `C:\Program Files (x86)\MySQL\MySQL Installer for
Windows`. You must run the console as administrator.

To use the console:

1. Open a command prompt with administrative privileges by
   selecting Windows System from
   Start, then right-click Command
   Prompt, select More, and
   select Run as administrator.
2. From the command line, optionally change the directory to
   where the [**MySQLInstallerConsole.exe**](MySQLInstallerConsole.md "2.3.3.5 MySQL Installer Console Reference") command
   is located. For example, to use the default installation
   location:

   ```terminal
   cd Program Files (x86)\MySQL\MySQL Installer for Windows
   ```
3. Type `MySQLInstallerConsole.exe` (or
   `mysqlinstallerconsole`) followed by a
   command action to perform a task. For example, to show the
   console's help:

   ```simple
   MySQLInstallerConsole.exe --help
   ```

   ```

##### Command Syntax

The [**MySQLInstallerConsole.exe**](MySQLInstallerConsole.md "2.3.3.5 MySQL Installer Console Reference") command can be
issued with or without the file extension
(`.exe`) and the command is not case-sensitive.

`mysqlinstallerconsole`[`.exe`]
[[[`--`]*`action`*]
[*`action_blocks_list`*]
[*`options_list`*]]

Description:

`action`
:   One of the permitted operational actions. If omitted, the
    default action is equivalent to the
    `--status` action. Using the
    `--` prefix is optional for all actions.

    Possible actions are: [--]`configure`,
    [--]`help`, [--]`install`,
    [--]`list`, [--]`modify`,
    [--]`remove`, [--]`set`,
    [--]`status`, [--]`update`,
    and [--]`upgrade`.

`action_blocks_list`
:   A list of blocks in which each represents a different item
    depending on the selected action. Blocks are separated by
    commas.

    The `--remove` and
    `--upgrade` actions permit specifying an
    asterisk character (`*`) to indicate all
    products. If the `*` character is
    detected at the start of this block, it is assumed all
    products are to be processed and the remainder of the
    block is ignored.

    Syntax:
    `*|action_block[,action_block][,action_block]...`

    *`action_block`*: Contains a
    product selector followed by an indefinite number of
    argument blocks that behave differently depending on the
    selected action (see
    [Command Actions](MySQLInstallerConsole.md#mi-console-actions "Command Actions")).

`options_list`
:   Zero or more options with possible values separated by
    spaces. See [Command Actions](MySQLInstallerConsole.md#mi-console-actions "Command Actions") to
    identify the options permitted for the corresponding
    action.

    Syntax:
    `option_value_pair[
    option_value_pair][
    option_value_pair]...`

    *`option_value_pair`*: A single
    option (for example, `--silent`) or a
    tuple of a key and a corresponding value with an options
    prefix. The key-value pair is in the form of
    `--key[=value]`.

##### Command Actions

[**MySQLInstallerConsole.exe**](MySQLInstallerConsole.md "2.3.3.5 MySQL Installer Console Reference") supports the
following command actions:

Note

Configuration block (or
arguments\_block) values
that contain a colon character (`:`) must be
wrapped in quotation marks. For example,
`install_dir="C:\MySQL\MySQL Server 8.0"`.

- `[--]configure
  [product1]:[configuration_argument]=[value],
  [product2]:[configuration_argument]=[value],
  [...]`

  Configures one or more MySQL products on your system.
  Multiple
  *`configuration_argument`*=*`value`*
  pairs can be configured for each product.

  Options:

  `--continue`
  :   Continues processing the next product when an error is
      caught while processing the action blocks containing
      arguments for each product. If not specified the whole
      operation is aborted in case of an error.

  `--help`
  :   Shows the options and available arguments for the
      corresponding action. If present the action is not
      executed, only the help is shown, so other
      action-related options are ignored as well.

  `--show-settings`
  :   Displays the available options for the selected
      product by passing in the product name after
      `--show-settings`.

  `--silent`
  :   Disables confirmation prompts.

  Examples:

  ```terminal
  MySQLInstallerConsole --configure --show-settings server
  ```

  ```terminal
  mysqlinstallerconsole.exe --configure server:port=3307
  ```
- `[--]help`

  Displays a help message with usage examples and then exits.
  Pass in an additional command action to receive help
  specific to that action.

  Options:

  `--action=[action]`
  :   Shows the help for a specific action. Same as using
      the `--help` option with an action.

      Permitted values are: `all`,
      `configure`, `help`
      (default), `install`,
      `list`, `modify`,
      `remove`, `status`,
      `update`, `upgrade`,
      and `set`.

  `--help`
  :   Shows the options and available arguments for the
      corresponding action. If present the action is not
      executed, only the help is shown, so other
      action-related options are ignored as well.

  Examples:

  ```terminal
  MySQLInstallerConsole help
  ```

  ```terminal
  MySQLInstallerConsole help --action=install
  ```
- `[--]install
  [product1]:[features]:[config
  block]:[config
  block],
  [product2]:[config
  block],
  [...]`

  Installs one or more MySQL products on your system. If
  pre-release products are available, both GA and pre-release
  products are installed when the value of the
  `--type` option value is
  `Client` or `Full`. Use
  the `--only_ga_products` option to restrict
  the product set to GA products only when using these setup
  types.

  Description:

  `[product]`
  :   Each product can be specified by a
      [product
      phrase](MySQLInstallerConsole.md#mi-console-product-phrase "Table 2.6 MySQL Product Phrases for use with the MySQLInstallerConsole.exe command") with or without a semicolon-separated
      version qualifier. Passing in a product keyword alone
      selects the latest version of the product. If multiple
      architectures are available for that version of the
      product, the command returns the first one in the
      manifest list for interactive confirmation.
      Alternatively, you can pass in the exact version and
      architecture `(x86` or
      `x64`) after the product keyword
      using the `--silent` option.

  `[features]`
  :   All features associated with a MySQL product are
      installed by default. The feature block is a
      semicolon-separated list of features or an asterisk
      character (`*`) that selects all
      features. To remove a feature, use the
      `modify` command.

  `[config block]`
  :   One or more configuration blocks can be specified.
      Each configuration block is a semicolon-separated list
      of key-value pairs. A block can include either a
      `config` or `user`
      type key; `config` is the default
      type if one is not defined.

      Configuration block values that contain a colon
      character (`:`) must be wrapped in
      quotation marks. For example,
      `installdir="C:\MySQL\MySQL Server
      8.0"`. Only one configuration type block can
      be defined for each product. A user block should be
      defined for each user to be created during the product
      installation.

      Note

      The `user` type key is not
      supported when a product is being reconfigured.

  Options:

  `--auto-handle-prereqs`
  :   If present, MySQL Installer attempts to download and install some
      software prerequisites, not currently present. that
      can be resolved with minimal intervention. If the
      `--silent` option is not present, you
      are presented with installation pages for each
      prerequisite. If the
      `--auto-handle-prereqs` options is
      omitted, packages with missing prerequisites are not
      installed.

  `--continue`
  :   Continues processing the next product when an error is
      caught while processing the action blocks containing
      arguments for each product. If not specified the whole
      operation is aborted in case of an error.

  `--help`
  :   Shows the options and available arguments for the
      corresponding action. If present the action is not
      executed, only the help is shown, so other
      action-related options are ignored as well.

  `--mos-password=password`
  :   Sets the My Oracle Support (MOS) user's password for
      commercial versions of the MySQL Installer.

  `--mos-user=user_name`
  :   Specifies the My Oracle Support (MOS) user name for
      access to the commercial version of MySQL Installer. If not
      present, only the products in the bundle, if any, are
      available to be installed.

  `--only-ga-products`
  :   Restricts the product set to include GA products only.

  `--setup-type=setup_type`
  :   Installs a predefined set of software. The setup type
      can be one of the following:

      - `Server`: Installs a single MySQL
        server
      - `Client`: Installs client
        programs and libraries (excludes MySQL connectors)
      - `Full`: Installs everything
        (excludes MySQL connectors)
      - `Custom`: Installs user-selected
        products. This is the default option.

      Note

      Non-custom setup types are valid only when no other
      MySQL products are installed.

  `--show-settings`
  :   Displays the available options for the selected
      product, by passing in the product name after
      `-showsettings`.

  `--silent`
  :   Disable confirmation prompts.

  mysqlinstallerconsole.exe --install j;8.0.29, net;8.0.28 --silent
  ```

  ```terminal
  MySQLInstallerConsole install server;8.0.30:*:port=3307;server_id=2:type=user;user=foo
  ```

  An example that passes in additional configuration blocks,
  separated by `^` to fit:

  ```terminal
  MySQLInstallerConsole --install server;8.0.30;x64:*:type=config;open_win_firewall=true; ^
     general_log=true;bin_log=true;server_id=3306;tcp_ip=true;port=3306;root_passwd=pass; ^
     install_dir="C:\MySQL\MySQL Server 8.0":type=user;user_name=foo;password=bar;role=DBManager
  ```
