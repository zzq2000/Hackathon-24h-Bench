### 12.3.7 The National Character Set

Standard SQL defines [`NCHAR`](char.md "13.3.2 The CHAR and VARCHAR Types") or
[`NATIONAL CHAR`](char.md "13.3.2 The CHAR and VARCHAR Types") as a way to
indicate that a [`CHAR`](char.md "13.3.2 The CHAR and VARCHAR Types") column
should use some predefined character set. MySQL uses
`utf8` as this predefined character set. For
example, these data type declarations are equivalent:

```sql
CHAR(10) CHARACTER SET utf8
NATIONAL CHARACTER(10)
NCHAR(10)
```

As are these:

```sql
VARCHAR(10) CHARACTER SET utf8
NATIONAL VARCHAR(10)
NVARCHAR(10)
NCHAR VARCHAR(10)
NATIONAL CHARACTER VARYING(10)
NATIONAL CHAR VARYING(10)
```

You can use
`N'literal'` (or
`n'literal'`) to
create a string in the national character set. These statements
are equivalent:

```sql
SELECT N'some text';
SELECT n'some text';
SELECT _utf8'some text';
```

MySQL 8.0 interprets the national character set as
`utf8mb3`, which is now deprecated. Thus, using
`NATIONAL CHARACTER` or one of its synonyms to
define the character set for a database, table, or column raises
a warning similar to this one:

```sql
NATIONAL/NCHAR/NVARCHAR implies the character set UTF8MB3, which will be
replaced by UTF8MB4 in a future release. Please consider using CHAR(x) CHARACTER
SET UTF8MB4 in order to be unambiguous.
```
