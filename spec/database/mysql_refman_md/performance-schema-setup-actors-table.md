#### 29.12.2.1 The setup\_actors Table

The [`setup_actors`](performance-schema-setup-actors-table.md "29.12.2.1 The setup_actors Table") table contains
information that determines whether to enable monitoring and
historical event logging for new foreground server threads
(threads associated with client connections). This table has a
maximum size of 100 rows by default. To change the table size,
modify the
[`performance_schema_setup_actors_size`](performance-schema-system-variables.md#sysvar_performance_schema_setup_actors_size)
system variable at server startup.

For each new foreground thread, the Performance Schema matches
the user and host for the thread against the rows of the
[`setup_actors`](performance-schema-setup-actors-table.md "29.12.2.1 The setup_actors Table") table. If a row from
that table matches, its `ENABLED` and
`HISTORY` column values are used to set the
`INSTRUMENTED` and `HISTORY`
columns, respectively, of the
[`threads`](performance-schema-threads-table.md "29.12.21.8 The threads Table") table row for the thread.
This enables instrumenting and historical event logging to be
applied selectively per host, user, or account (user and host
combination). If there is no match, the
`INSTRUMENTED` and `HISTORY`
columns for the thread are set to `NO`.

For background threads, there is no associated user.
`INSTRUMENTED` and `HISTORY`
are `YES` by default and
[`setup_actors`](performance-schema-setup-actors-table.md "29.12.2.1 The setup_actors Table") is not consulted.

The initial contents of the
[`setup_actors`](performance-schema-setup-actors-table.md "29.12.2.1 The setup_actors Table") table match any user
and host combination, so monitoring and historical event
collection are enabled by default for all foreground threads:

```sql
mysql> SELECT * FROM performance_schema.setup_actors;
+------+------+------+---------+---------+
| HOST | USER | ROLE | ENABLED | HISTORY |
+------+------+------+---------+---------+
| %    | %    | %    | YES     | YES     |
+------+------+------+---------+---------+
```

For information about how to use the
[`setup_actors`](performance-schema-setup-actors-table.md "29.12.2.1 The setup_actors Table") table to affect
event monitoring, see
[Section 29.4.6, “Pre-Filtering by Thread”](performance-schema-thread-filtering.md "29.4.6 Pre-Filtering by Thread").

Modifications to the [`setup_actors`](performance-schema-setup-actors-table.md "29.12.2.1 The setup_actors Table")
table affect only foreground threads created subsequent to the
modification, not existing threads. To affect existing
threads, modify the `INSTRUMENTED` and
`HISTORY` columns of
[`threads`](performance-schema-threads-table.md "29.12.21.8 The threads Table") table rows.

The [`setup_actors`](performance-schema-setup-actors-table.md "29.12.2.1 The setup_actors Table") table has these
columns:

- `HOST`

  The host name. This should be a literal name, or
  `'%'` to mean “any host.”
- `USER`

  The user name. This should be a literal name, or
  `'%'` to mean “any user.”
- `ROLE`

  Unused.
- `ENABLED`

  Whether to enable instrumentation for foreground threads
  matched by the row. The value is `YES` or
  `NO`.
- `HISTORY`

  Whether to log historical events for foreground threads
  matched by the row. The value is `YES` or
  `NO`.

The [`setup_actors`](performance-schema-setup-actors-table.md "29.12.2.1 The setup_actors Table") table has these
indexes:

- Primary key on (`HOST`,
  `USER`, `ROLE`)

[`TRUNCATE TABLE`](truncate-table.md "15.1.37 TRUNCATE TABLE Statement") is permitted for
the [`setup_actors`](performance-schema-setup-actors-table.md "29.12.2.1 The setup_actors Table") table. It
removes the rows.
