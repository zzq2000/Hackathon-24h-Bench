#### 7.6.3.3 Thread Pool Operation

The thread pool consists of a number of thread groups, each of
which manages a set of client connections. As connections are
established, the thread pool assigns them to thread groups in
round-robin fashion.

The thread pool exposes system variables that may be used to
configure its operation:

- [`thread_pool_algorithm`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_thread_pool_algorithm): The
  concurrency algorithm to use for scheduling.
- [`thread_pool_dedicated_listeners`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_thread_pool_dedicated_listeners):
  Dedicates a listener thread in each thread group to listen
  for incoming statements from connections assigned to the
  group.
- [`thread_pool_high_priority_connection`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_thread_pool_high_priority_connection):
  How to schedule statement execution for a session.
- [`thread_pool_max_active_query_threads`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_thread_pool_max_active_query_threads):
  How many active threads per group to permit.
- [`thread_pool_max_transactions_limit`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_thread_pool_max_transactions_limit):
  The maximum number of transactions permitted by the thread
  pool plugin.
- [`thread_pool_max_unused_threads`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_thread_pool_max_unused_threads):
  How many sleeping threads to permit.
- [`thread_pool_prio_kickup_timer`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_thread_pool_prio_kickup_timer):
  How long before the thread pool moves a statement awaiting
  execution from the low-priority queue to the high-priority
  queue.
- [`thread_pool_query_threads_per_group`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_thread_pool_query_threads_per_group):
  The number of query threads permitted in a thread group (the
  default is a single query thread). Consider increasing the
  value if you experience slower response times due to
  long-running transactions.
- [`thread_pool_size`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_thread_pool_size): The
  number of thread groups in the thread pool. This is the most
  important parameter controlling thread pool performance.
- [`thread_pool_stall_limit`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_thread_pool_stall_limit):
  The time before an executing statement is considered to be
  stalled.
- [`thread_pool_transaction_delay`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_thread_pool_transaction_delay):
  The delay period before starting a new transaction.

To configure the number of thread groups, use the
[`thread_pool_size`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_thread_pool_size) system
variable. The default number of groups is 16. For guidelines on
setting this variable, see [Section 7.6.3.4, “Thread Pool Tuning”](thread-pool-tuning.md "7.6.3.4 Thread Pool Tuning").

The maximum number of threads per group is 4096 (or 4095 on some
systems where one thread is used internally).

The thread pool separates connections and threads, so there is
no fixed relationship between connections and the threads that
execute statements received from those connections. This differs
from the default thread-handling model that associates one
thread with one connection such that a given thread executes all
statements from its connection.

By default, the thread pool tries to ensure a maximum of one
thread executing in each group at any time, but sometimes
permits more threads to execute temporarily for best
performance:

- Each thread group has a listener thread that listens for
  incoming statements from the connections assigned to the
  group. When a statement arrives, the thread group either
  begins executing it immediately or queues it for later
  execution:

  - Immediate execution occurs if the statement is the only
    one received, and there are no statements queued or
    currently executing.

    From MySQL 8.0.31, immediate execution can be delayed by
    configuring
    `thread_pool_transaction_delay`, which
    has a throttling effect on transactions. For more
    information, refer to the description of this variable
    in the discussion that follows.
  - Queuing occurs if the statement cannot begin executing
    immediately due to concurrently queued or executing
    statements.
- The
  [`thread_pool_transaction_delay`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_thread_pool_transaction_delay)
  variable specifies a transaction delay in milliseconds.
  Worker threads sleep for the specified period before
  executing a new transaction.

  A transaction delay can be used in cases where parallel
  transactions affect the performance of other operations due
  to resource contention. For example, if parallel
  transactions affect index creation or an online buffer pool
  resizing operation, you can configure a transaction delay to
  reduce resource contention while those operations are
  running. The delay has a throttling effect on transactions.

  The `thread_pool_transaction_delay` setting
  does not affect queries issued from a privileged connection
  (a connection assigned to the `Admin`
  thread group). These queries are not subject to a configured
  transaction delay.
- If immediate execution occurs, the listener thread performs
  it. (This means that temporarily no thread in the group is
  listening.) If the statement finishes quickly, the executing
  thread returns to listening for statements. Otherwise, the
  thread pool considers the statement stalled and starts
  another thread as a listener thread (creating it if
  necessary). To ensure that no thread group becomes blocked
  by stalled statements, the thread pool has a background
  thread that regularly monitors thread group states.

  By using the listening thread to execute a statement that
  can begin immediately, there is no need to create an
  additional thread if the statement finishes quickly. This
  ensures the most efficient execution possible in the case of
  a low number of concurrent threads.

  When the thread pool plugin starts, it creates one thread
  per group (the listener thread), plus the background thread.
  Additional threads are created as necessary to execute
  statements.
- The value of the
  [`thread_pool_stall_limit`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_thread_pool_stall_limit)
  system variable determines the meaning of “finishes
  quickly” in the previous item. The default time
  before threads are considered stalled is 60ms but can be set
  to a maximum of 6s. This parameter is configurable to enable
  you to strike a balance appropriate for the server work
  load. Short wait values permit threads to start more
  quickly. Short values are also better for avoiding deadlock
  situations. Long wait values are useful for workloads that
  include long-running statements, to avoid starting too many
  new statements while the current ones execute.
- If
  [`thread_pool_max_active_query_threads`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_thread_pool_max_active_query_threads)
  is 0, the default algorithm applies as just described for
  determining the maximum number of active threads per group.
  The default algorithm takes stalled threads into account and
  may temporarily permit more active threads. If
  [`thread_pool_max_active_query_threads`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_thread_pool_max_active_query_threads)
  is greater than 0, it places a limit on the number of active
  threads per group.
- The thread pool focuses on limiting the number of concurrent
  short-running statements. Before an executing statement
  reaches the stall time, it prevents other statements from
  beginning to execute. If the statement executes past the
  stall time, it is permitted to continue but no longer
  prevents other statements from starting. In this way, the
  thread pool tries to ensure that in each thread group there
  is never more than one short-running statement, although
  there might be multiple long-running statements. It is
  undesirable to let long-running statements prevent other
  statements from executing because there is no limit on the
  amount of waiting that might be necessary. For example, on a
  replication source server, a thread that is sending binary
  log events to a replica effectively runs forever.
- A statement becomes blocked if it encounters a disk I/O
  operation or a user level lock (row lock or table lock). The
  block would cause the thread group to become unused, so
  there are callbacks to the thread pool to ensure that the
  thread pool can immediately start a new thread in this group
  to execute another statement. When a blocked thread returns,
  the thread pool permits it to restart immediately.
- There are two queues, a high-priority queue and a
  low-priority queue. The first statement in a transaction
  goes to the low-priority queue. Any following statements for
  the transaction go to the high-priority queue if the
  transaction is ongoing (statements for it have begun
  executing), or to the low-priority queue otherwise. Queue
  assignment can be affected by enabling the
  [`thread_pool_high_priority_connection`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_thread_pool_high_priority_connection)
  system variable, which causes all queued statements for a
  session to go into the high-priority queue.

  Statements for a nontransactional storage engine, or a
  transactional engine if
  [`autocommit`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_autocommit) is enabled, are
  treated as low-priority statements because in this case each
  statement is a transaction. Thus, given a mix of statements
  for `InnoDB` and `MyISAM`
  tables, the thread pool prioritizes those for
  `InnoDB` over those for
  `MyISAM` unless
  [`autocommit`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_autocommit) is enabled. With
  [`autocommit`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_autocommit) enabled, all
  statements have low priority.
- When the thread group selects a queued statement for
  execution, it first looks in the high-priority queue, then
  in the low-priority queue. If a statement is found, it is
  removed from its queue and begins to execute.
- If a statement stays in the low-priority queue too long, the
  thread pool moves to the high-priority queue. The value of
  the
  [`thread_pool_prio_kickup_timer`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_thread_pool_prio_kickup_timer)
  system variable controls the time before movement. For each
  thread group, a maximum of one statement per 10ms (100 per
  second) is moved from the low-priority queue to the
  high-priority queue.
- The thread pool reuses the most active threads to obtain a
  much better use of CPU caches. This is a small adjustment
  that has a great impact on performance.
- While a thread executes a statement from a user connection,
  Performance Schema instrumentation accounts thread activity
  to the user connection. Otherwise, Performance Schema
  accounts activity to the thread pool.

Here are examples of conditions under which a thread group might
have multiple threads started to execute statements:

- One thread begins executing a statement, but runs long
  enough to be considered stalled. The thread group permits
  another thread to begin executing another statement even
  through the first thread is still executing.
- One thread begins executing a statement, then becomes
  blocked and reports this back to the thread pool. The thread
  group permits another thread to begin executing another
  statement.
- One thread begins executing a statement, becomes blocked,
  but does not report back that it is blocked because the
  block does not occur in code that has been instrumented with
  thread pool callbacks. In this case, the thread appears to
  the thread group to be still running. If the block lasts
  long enough for the statement to be considered stalled, the
  group permits another thread to begin executing another
  statement.

The thread pool is designed to be scalable across an increasing
number of connections. It is also designed to avoid deadlocks
that can arise from limiting the number of actively executing
statements. It is important that threads that do not report back
to the thread pool do not prevent other statements from
executing and thus cause the thread pool to become deadlocked.
Examples of such statements follow:

- Long-running statements. These would lead to all resources
  used by only a few statements and they could prevent all
  others from accessing the server.
- Binary log dump threads that read the binary log and send it
  to replicas. This is a kind of long-running
  “statement” that runs for a very long time, and
  that should not prevent other statements from executing.
- Statements blocked on a row lock, table lock, sleep, or any
  other blocking activity that has not been reported back to
  the thread pool by MySQL Server or a storage engine.

In each case, to prevent deadlock, the statement is moved to the
stalled category when it does not complete quickly, so that the
thread group can permit another statement to begin executing.
With this design, when a thread executes or becomes blocked for
an extended time, the thread pool moves the thread to the
stalled category and for the rest of the statement's execution,
it does not prevent other statements from executing.

The maximum number of threads that can occur is the sum of
[`max_connections`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_max_connections) and
[`thread_pool_size`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_thread_pool_size). This can
happen in a situation where all connections are in execution
mode and an extra thread is created per group to listen for more
statements. This is not necessarily a state that happens often,
but it is theoretically possible.

##### Privileged Connections

When the limit defined by
[`thread_pool_max_transactions_limit`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_thread_pool_max_transactions_limit)
has been reached, new connections appear to hang until one or
more existing transactions are completed. The same occurs when
attempting to start a new transaction on an existing connection.
If existing connections are blocked or long-running, the only
way to access the server is using a privileged connection.

To establish a privileged connection, the user initiating the
connection must have the
[`TP_CONNECTION_ADMIN`](privileges-provided.md#priv_tp-connection-admin) privilege. A
privileged connection ignores the limit defined by
[`thread_pool_max_transactions_limit`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_thread_pool_max_transactions_limit)
and permits connecting to the server to increase the limit,
remove the limit, or kill running transactions.
[`TP_CONNECTION_ADMIN`](privileges-provided.md#priv_tp-connection-admin)
privilege must be granted explicitly. It is not granted to any
user by default.

A privileged connection can execute statements and start
transactions, and is assigned to a thread group designated as
the `Admin` thread group.

When querying the
[`performance_schema.tp_thread_group_stats`](performance-schema-tp-thread-group-stats-table.md "29.12.16.2 The tp_thread_group_stats Table")
table, which reports statistics per thread group,
`Admin` thread group statistics are reported in
the last row of the result set. For example, if `SELECT
* FROM performance_schema.tp_thread_group_stats\G`
returns 17 rows (one row per thread group), the
`Admin` thread group statistics are reported in
the 17th row.
