### 28.3.45 The INFORMATION\_SCHEMA TRIGGERS Table

The [`TRIGGERS`](information-schema-triggers-table.md "28.3.45 The INFORMATION_SCHEMA TRIGGERS Table") table provides
information about triggers. To see information about a table's
triggers, you must have the [`TRIGGER`](privileges-provided.md#priv_trigger)
privilege for the table.

The [`TRIGGERS`](information-schema-triggers-table.md "28.3.45 The INFORMATION_SCHEMA TRIGGERS Table") table has these columns:

- `TRIGGER_CATALOG`

  The name of the catalog to which the trigger belongs. This
  value is always `def`.
- `TRIGGER_SCHEMA`

  The name of the schema (database) to which the trigger
  belongs.
- `TRIGGER_NAME`

  The name of the trigger.
- `EVENT_MANIPULATION`

  The trigger event. This is the type of operation on the
  associated table for which the trigger activates. The value is
  `INSERT` (a row was inserted),
  `DELETE` (a row was deleted), or
  `UPDATE` (a row was modified).
- `EVENT_OBJECT_CATALOG`,
  `EVENT_OBJECT_SCHEMA`, and
  `EVENT_OBJECT_TABLE`

  As noted in [Section 27.3, “Using Triggers”](triggers.md "27.3 Using Triggers"), every trigger is
  associated with exactly one table. These columns indicate the
  catalog and schema (database) in which this table occurs, and
  the table name, respectively. The
  `EVENT_OBJECT_CATALOG` value is always
  `def`.
- `ACTION_ORDER`

  The ordinal position of the trigger's action within the list
  of triggers on the same table with the same
  `EVENT_MANIPULATION` and
  `ACTION_TIMING` values.
- `ACTION_CONDITION`

  This value is always `NULL`.
- `ACTION_STATEMENT`

  The trigger body; that is, the statement executed when the
  trigger activates. This text uses UTF-8 encoding.
- `ACTION_ORIENTATION`

  This value is always `ROW`.
- `ACTION_TIMING`

  Whether the trigger activates before or after the triggering
  event. The value is `BEFORE` or
  `AFTER`.
- `ACTION_REFERENCE_OLD_TABLE`

  This value is always `NULL`.
- `ACTION_REFERENCE_NEW_TABLE`

  This value is always `NULL`.
- `ACTION_REFERENCE_OLD_ROW` and
  `ACTION_REFERENCE_NEW_ROW`

  The old and new column identifiers, respectively. The
  `ACTION_REFERENCE_OLD_ROW` value is always
  `OLD` and the
  `ACTION_REFERENCE_NEW_ROW` value is always
  `NEW`.
- `CREATED`

  The date and time when the trigger was created. This is a
  `TIMESTAMP(2)` value (with a fractional part
  in hundredths of seconds) for triggers.
- `SQL_MODE`

  The SQL mode in effect when the trigger was created, and under
  which the trigger executes. For the permitted values, see
  [Section 7.1.11, “Server SQL Modes”](sql-mode.md "7.1.11 Server SQL Modes").
- `DEFINER`

  The account named in the `DEFINER` clause
  (often the user who created the trigger), in
  `'user_name'@'host_name'`
  format.
- `CHARACTER_SET_CLIENT`

  The session value of the
  [`character_set_client`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_character_set_client) system
  variable when the trigger was created.
- `COLLATION_CONNECTION`

  The session value of the
  [`collation_connection`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_collation_connection) system
  variable when the trigger was created.
- `DATABASE_COLLATION`

  The collation of the database with which the trigger is
  associated.

#### Example

The following example uses the `ins_sum` trigger
defined in [Section 27.3, “Using Triggers”](triggers.md "27.3 Using Triggers"):

```sql
mysql> SELECT * FROM INFORMATION_SCHEMA.TRIGGERS
       WHERE TRIGGER_SCHEMA='test' AND TRIGGER_NAME='ins_sum'\G
*************************** 1. row ***************************
           TRIGGER_CATALOG: def
            TRIGGER_SCHEMA: test
              TRIGGER_NAME: ins_sum
        EVENT_MANIPULATION: INSERT
      EVENT_OBJECT_CATALOG: def
       EVENT_OBJECT_SCHEMA: test
        EVENT_OBJECT_TABLE: account
              ACTION_ORDER: 1
          ACTION_CONDITION: NULL
          ACTION_STATEMENT: SET @sum = @sum + NEW.amount
        ACTION_ORIENTATION: ROW
             ACTION_TIMING: BEFORE
ACTION_REFERENCE_OLD_TABLE: NULL
ACTION_REFERENCE_NEW_TABLE: NULL
  ACTION_REFERENCE_OLD_ROW: OLD
  ACTION_REFERENCE_NEW_ROW: NEW
                   CREATED: 2018-08-08 10:10:12.61
                  SQL_MODE: ONLY_FULL_GROUP_BY,STRICT_TRANS_TABLES,
                            NO_ZERO_IN_DATE,NO_ZERO_DATE,
                            ERROR_FOR_DIVISION_BY_ZERO,
                            NO_ENGINE_SUBSTITUTION
                   DEFINER: me@localhost
      CHARACTER_SET_CLIENT: utf8mb4
      COLLATION_CONNECTION: utf8mb4_0900_ai_ci
        DATABASE_COLLATION: utf8mb4_0900_ai_ci
```

Trigger information is also available from the
[`SHOW TRIGGERS`](show-triggers.md "15.7.7.40 SHOW TRIGGERS Statement") statement. See
[Section 15.7.7.40, “SHOW TRIGGERS Statement”](show-triggers.md "15.7.7.40 SHOW TRIGGERS Statement").
