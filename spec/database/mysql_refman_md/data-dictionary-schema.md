## 16.1 Data Dictionary Schema

Data dictionary tables are protected and may only be accessed in
debug builds of MySQL. However, MySQL supports access to data
stored in data dictionary tables through
[`INFORMATION_SCHEMA`](information-schema.md "Chapter 28 INFORMATION_SCHEMA Tables") tables and
[`SHOW`](show.md "15.7.7 SHOW Statements") statements. For an overview of
the tables that comprise the data dictionary, see
[Data Dictionary Tables](system-schema.md#system-schema-data-dictionary-tables "Data Dictionary Tables").

MySQL system tables still exist in MySQL 8.0 and can
be viewed by issuing a [`SHOW TABLES`](show-tables.md "15.7.7.39 SHOW TABLES Statement")
statement on the `mysql` system database.
Generally, the difference between MySQL data dictionary tables and
system tables is that data dictionary tables contain metadata
required to execute SQL queries, whereas system tables contain
auxiliary data such as time zone and help information. MySQL
system tables and data dictionary tables also differ in how they
are upgraded. The MySQL server manages data dictionary upgrades.
See [How the Data Dictionary is Upgraded](data-dictionary-schema.md#data-dictionary-upgrade "How the Data Dictionary is Upgraded"). Upgrading MySQL
system tables requires running the full MySQL upgrade procedure.
See [Section 3.4, “What the MySQL Upgrade Process Upgrades”](upgrading-what-is-upgraded.md "3.4 What the MySQL Upgrade Process Upgrades").

### How the Data Dictionary is Upgraded

New versions of MySQL may include changes to data dictionary
table definitions. Such changes are present in newly installed
versions of MySQL, but when performing an in-place upgrade of
MySQL binaries, changes are applied when the MySQL server is
restarted using the new binaries. At startup, the data
dictionary version of the server is compared to the version
information stored in the data dictionary to determine if data
dictionary tables should be upgraded. If an upgrade is necessary
and supported, the server creates data dictionary tables with
updated definitions, copies persisted metadata to the new
tables, atomically replaces the old tables with the new ones,
and reinitializes the data dictionary. If an upgrade is not
necessary, startup continues without updating the data
dictionary tables.

Upgrade of data dictionary tables is an atomic operation, which
means that all of the data dictionary tables are upgraded as
necessary or the operation fails. If the upgrade operation
fails, server startup fails with an error. In this case, the old
server binaries can be used with the old data directory to start
the server. When the new server binaries are used again to start
the server, the data dictionary upgrade is reattempted.

Generally, after data dictionary tables are successfully
upgraded, it is not possible to restart the server using the old
server binaries. As a result, downgrading MySQL server binaries
to a previous MySQL version is not supported after data
dictionary tables are upgraded.

The [**mysqld**](mysqld.md "6.3.1 mysqld — The MySQL Server")
[`--no-dd-upgrade`](server-options.md#option_mysqld_no-dd-upgrade) option can be
used to prevent automatic upgrade of data dictionary tables at
startup. When [`--no-dd-upgrade`](server-options.md#option_mysqld_no-dd-upgrade) is
specified, and the server finds that the data dictionary version
of the server is different from the version stored in the data
dictionary, startup fails with an error stating that the data
dictionary upgrade is prohibited.

### Viewing Data Dictionary Tables Using a Debug Build of MySQL

Data dictionary tables are protected by default but can be
accessed by compiling MySQL with debugging support (using the
`-DWITH_DEBUG=1`
**CMake** option) and specifying the
`+d,skip_dd_table_access_check`
[`debug`](server-options.md#option_mysqld_debug) option and modifier. For
information about compiling debug builds, see
[Section 7.9.1.1, “Compiling MySQL for Debugging”](compiling-for-debugging.md "7.9.1.1 Compiling MySQL for Debugging").

Warning

Modifying or writing to data dictionary tables directly is not
recommended and may render your MySQL instance inoperable.

After compiling MySQL with debugging support, use this
[`SET`](set.md "13.3.6 The SET Type") statement to make data
dictionary tables visible to the [**mysql**](mysql.md "6.5.1 mysql — The MySQL Command-Line Client") client
session:

```sql
mysql> SET SESSION debug='+d,skip_dd_table_access_check';
```

Use this query to retrieve a list of data dictionary tables:

```sql
mysql> SELECT name, schema_id, hidden, type FROM mysql.tables where schema_id=1 AND hidden='System';
```

Use [`SHOW CREATE TABLE`](show-create-table.md "15.7.7.10 SHOW CREATE TABLE Statement") to view
data dictionary table definitions. For example:

```sql
mysql> SHOW CREATE TABLE mysql.catalogs\G
```
