### 25.4.4 Using High-Speed Interconnects with NDB Cluster

Even before design of [`NDBCLUSTER`](mysql-cluster.md "Chapter 25 MySQL NDB Cluster 8.0")
began in 1996, it was evident that one of the major problems to be
encountered in building parallel databases would be communication
between the nodes in the network. For this reason,
[`NDBCLUSTER`](mysql-cluster.md "Chapter 25 MySQL NDB Cluster 8.0") was designed from the very
beginning to permit the use of a number of different data
transport mechanisms, or transporters.

NDB Cluster 8.0 supports three of these (see
[Section 25.2.1, “NDB Cluster Core Concepts”](mysql-cluster-basics.md "25.2.1 NDB Cluster Core Concepts")). A fourth transporter,
Scalable Coherent Interface (SCI), was also supported in very old
versions of `NDB`. This required specialized
hardware, software, and MySQL binaries that are no longer
available.
