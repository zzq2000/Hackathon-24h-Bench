### 28.3.38 The INFORMATION\_SCHEMA TABLES Table

The [`TABLES`](information-schema-tables-table.md "28.3.38 The INFORMATION_SCHEMA TABLES Table") table provides information
about tables in databases.

Columns in [`TABLES`](information-schema-tables-table.md "28.3.38 The INFORMATION_SCHEMA TABLES Table") that represent
table statistics hold cached values. The
[`information_schema_stats_expiry`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_information_schema_stats_expiry)
system variable defines the period of time before cached table
statistics expire. The default is 86400 seconds (24 hours). If
there are no cached statistics or statistics have expired,
statistics are retrieved from storage engines when querying table
statistics columns. To update cached values at any time for a
given table, use [`ANALYZE TABLE`](analyze-table.md "15.7.3.1 ANALYZE TABLE Statement"). To
always retrieve the latest statistics directly from storage
engines, set
[`information_schema_stats_expiry`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_information_schema_stats_expiry)
to `0`. For more information, see
[Section 10.2.3, “Optimizing INFORMATION\_SCHEMA Queries”](information-schema-optimization.md "10.2.3 Optimizing INFORMATION_SCHEMA Queries").

Note

If the [`innodb_read_only`](innodb-parameters.md#sysvar_innodb_read_only) system
variable is enabled, [`ANALYZE
TABLE`](analyze-table.md "15.7.3.1 ANALYZE TABLE Statement") may fail because it cannot update statistics
tables in the data dictionary, which use
`InnoDB`. For [`ANALYZE
TABLE`](analyze-table.md "15.7.3.1 ANALYZE TABLE Statement") operations that update the key distribution,
failure may occur even if the operation updates the table itself
(for example, if it is a `MyISAM` table). To
obtain the updated distribution statistics, set
[`information_schema_stats_expiry=0`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_information_schema_stats_expiry).

The [`TABLES`](information-schema-tables-table.md "28.3.38 The INFORMATION_SCHEMA TABLES Table") table has these columns:

- `TABLE_CATALOG`

  The name of the catalog to which the table belongs. This value
  is always `def`.
- `TABLE_SCHEMA`

  The name of the schema (database) to which the table belongs.
- `TABLE_NAME`

  The name of the table.
- `TABLE_TYPE`

  `BASE TABLE` for a table,
  `VIEW` for a view, or `SYSTEM
  VIEW` for an `INFORMATION_SCHEMA`
  table.

  The [`TABLES`](information-schema-tables-table.md "28.3.38 The INFORMATION_SCHEMA TABLES Table") table does not list
  `TEMPORARY` tables.
- `ENGINE`

  The storage engine for the table. See
  [Chapter 17, *The InnoDB Storage Engine*](innodb-storage-engine.md "Chapter 17 The InnoDB Storage Engine"), and
  [Chapter 18, *Alternative Storage Engines*](storage-engines.md "Chapter 18 Alternative Storage Engines").

  For partitioned tables, `ENGINE` shows the
  name of the storage engine used by all partitions.
- `VERSION`

  This column is unused. With the removal of
  `.frm` files in MySQL 8.0, this column now
  reports a hardcoded value of `10`, which is
  the last `.frm` file version used in MySQL
  5.7.
- `ROW_FORMAT`

  The row-storage format (`Fixed`,
  `Dynamic`, `Compressed`,
  `Redundant`, `Compact`). For
  `MyISAM` tables, `Dynamic`
  corresponds to what [**myisamchk -dvv**](myisamchk.md "6.6.4 myisamchk — MyISAM Table-Maintenance Utility") reports
  as `Packed`.
- `TABLE_ROWS`

  The number of rows. Some storage engines, such as
  `MyISAM`, store the exact count. For other
  storage engines, such as `InnoDB`, this value
  is an approximation, and may vary from the actual value by as
  much as 40% to 50%. In such cases, use `SELECT
  COUNT(*)` to obtain an accurate count.

  `TABLE_ROWS` is `NULL` for
  `INFORMATION_SCHEMA` tables.

  For [`InnoDB`](innodb-storage-engine.md "Chapter 17 The InnoDB Storage Engine") tables, the row count
  is only a rough estimate used in SQL optimization. (This is
  also true if the [`InnoDB`](innodb-storage-engine.md "Chapter 17 The InnoDB Storage Engine") table is
  partitioned.)
- `AVG_ROW_LENGTH`

  The average row length.
- `DATA_LENGTH`

  For `MyISAM`, `DATA_LENGTH`
  is the length of the data file, in bytes.

  For `InnoDB`, `DATA_LENGTH`
  is the approximate amount of space allocated for the clustered
  index, in bytes. Specifically, it is the clustered index size,
  in pages, multiplied by the `InnoDB` page
  size.

  Refer to the notes at the end of this section for information
  regarding other storage engines.
- `MAX_DATA_LENGTH`

  For `MyISAM`,
  `MAX_DATA_LENGTH` is maximum length of the
  data file. This is the total number of bytes of data that can
  be stored in the table, given the data pointer size used.

  Unused for `InnoDB`.

  Refer to the notes at the end of this section for information
  regarding other storage engines.
- `INDEX_LENGTH`

  For `MyISAM`, `INDEX_LENGTH`
  is the length of the index file, in bytes.

  For `InnoDB`, `INDEX_LENGTH`
  is the approximate amount of space allocated for non-clustered
  indexes, in bytes. Specifically, it is the sum of
  non-clustered index sizes, in pages, multiplied by the
  `InnoDB` page size.

  Refer to the notes at the end of this section for information
  regarding other storage engines.
- `DATA_FREE`

  The number of allocated but unused bytes.

  `InnoDB` tables report the free space of the
  tablespace to which the table belongs. For a table located in
  the shared tablespace, this is the free space of the shared
  tablespace. If you are using multiple tablespaces and the
  table has its own tablespace, the free space is for only that
  table. Free space means the number of bytes in completely free
  extents minus a safety margin. Even if free space displays as
  0, it may be possible to insert rows as long as new extents
  need not be allocated.

  For NDB Cluster, `DATA_FREE` shows the space
  allocated on disk for, but not used by, a Disk Data table or
  fragment on disk. (In-memory data resource usage is reported
  by the `DATA_LENGTH` column.)

  For partitioned tables, this value is only an estimate and may
  not be absolutely correct. A more accurate method of obtaining
  this information in such cases is to query the
  `INFORMATION_SCHEMA`
  [`PARTITIONS`](information-schema-partitions-table.md "28.3.21 The INFORMATION_SCHEMA PARTITIONS Table") table, as shown in
  this example:

  ```sql
  SELECT SUM(DATA_FREE)
      FROM  INFORMATION_SCHEMA.PARTITIONS
      WHERE TABLE_SCHEMA = 'mydb'
      AND   TABLE_NAME   = 'mytable';
  ```

  For more information, see
  [Section 28.3.21, “The INFORMATION\_SCHEMA PARTITIONS Table”](information-schema-partitions-table.md "28.3.21 The INFORMATION_SCHEMA PARTITIONS Table").
- `AUTO_INCREMENT`

  The next `AUTO_INCREMENT` value.
- `CREATE_TIME`

  When the table was created.
- `UPDATE_TIME`

  When the table was last updated. For some storage engines,
  this value is `NULL`. Even with
  [file-per-table](glossary.md#glos_file_per_table "file-per-table") mode
  with each `InnoDB` table in a separate
  `.ibd` file,
  [change buffering](glossary.md#glos_change_buffering "change buffering")
  can delay the write to the data file, so the file modification
  time is different from the time of the last insert, update, or
  delete. For `MyISAM`, the data file timestamp
  is used; however, on Windows the timestamp is not updated by
  updates, so the value is inaccurate.

  `UPDATE_TIME` displays a timestamp value for
  the last [`UPDATE`](update.md "15.2.17 UPDATE Statement"),
  [`INSERT`](insert.md "15.2.7 INSERT Statement"), or
  [`DELETE`](delete.md "15.2.2 DELETE Statement") performed on
  `InnoDB` tables that are not partitioned. For
  MVCC, the timestamp value reflects the
  [`COMMIT`](commit.md "15.3.1 START TRANSACTION, COMMIT, and ROLLBACK Statements") time, which is
  considered the last update time. Timestamps are not persisted
  when the server is restarted or when the table is evicted from
  the `InnoDB` data dictionary cache.
- `CHECK_TIME`

  When the table was last checked. Not all storage engines
  update this time, in which case, the value is always
  `NULL`.

  For partitioned [`InnoDB`](innodb-storage-engine.md "Chapter 17 The InnoDB Storage Engine") tables,
  `CHECK_TIME` is always
  `NULL`.
- `TABLE_COLLATION`

  The table default collation. The output does not explicitly
  list the table default character set, but the collation name
  begins with the character set name.
- `CHECKSUM`

  The live checksum value, if any.
- `CREATE_OPTIONS`

  Extra options used with [`CREATE
  TABLE`](create-table.md "15.1.20 CREATE TABLE Statement").

  `CREATE_OPTIONS` shows
  `partitioned` for a partitioned table.

  Prior to MySQL 8.0.16, `CREATE_OPTIONS` shows
  the `ENCRYPTION` clause specified for tables
  created in file-per-table tablespaces. As of MySQL 8.0.16, it
  shows the encryption clause for file-per-table tablespaces if
  the table is encrypted or if the specified encryption differs
  from the schema encryption. The encryption clause is not shown
  for tables created in general tablespaces. To identify
  encrypted file-per-table and general tablespaces, query the
  [`INNODB_TABLESPACES`](information-schema-innodb-tablespaces-table.md "28.4.24 The INFORMATION_SCHEMA INNODB_TABLESPACES Table")
  `ENCRYPTION` column.

  When creating a table with
  [strict mode](glossary.md#glos_strict_mode "strict mode") disabled,
  the storage engine's default row format is used if the
  specified row format is not supported. The actual row format
  of the table is reported in the `ROW_FORMAT`
  column. `CREATE_OPTIONS` shows the row format
  that was specified in the [`CREATE
  TABLE`](create-table.md "15.1.20 CREATE TABLE Statement") statement.

  When altering the storage engine of a table, table options
  that are not applicable to the new storage engine are retained
  in the table definition to enable reverting the table with its
  previously defined options to the original storage engine, if
  necessary. The `CREATE_OPTIONS` column may
  show retained options.
- `TABLE_COMMENT`

  The comment used when creating the table (or information as to
  why MySQL could not access the table information).

#### Notes

- For [`NDB`](mysql-cluster.md "Chapter 25 MySQL NDB Cluster 8.0") tables, the output of
  this statement shows appropriate values for the
  `AVG_ROW_LENGTH` and
  `DATA_LENGTH` columns, with the exception
  that [`BLOB`](blob.md "13.3.4 The BLOB and TEXT Types") columns are not taken
  into account.
- For [`NDB`](mysql-cluster.md "Chapter 25 MySQL NDB Cluster 8.0") tables,
  `DATA_LENGTH` includes data stored in main
  memory only; the `MAX_DATA_LENGTH` and
  `DATA_FREE` columns apply to Disk Data.
- For NDB Cluster Disk Data tables,
  `MAX_DATA_LENGTH` shows the space allocated
  for the disk part of a Disk Data table or fragment. (In-memory
  data resource usage is reported by the
  `DATA_LENGTH` column.)
- For `MEMORY` tables, the
  `DATA_LENGTH`,
  `MAX_DATA_LENGTH`, and
  `INDEX_LENGTH` values approximate the actual
  amount of allocated memory. The allocation algorithm reserves
  memory in large amounts to reduce the number of allocation
  operations.
- For views, most [`TABLES`](information-schema-tables-table.md "28.3.38 The INFORMATION_SCHEMA TABLES Table") columns
  are 0 or `NULL` except that
  `TABLE_NAME` indicates the view name,
  `CREATE_TIME` indicates the creation time,
  and `TABLE_COMMENT` says
  `VIEW`.

Table information is also available from the
[`SHOW TABLE STATUS`](show-table-status.md "15.7.7.38 SHOW TABLE STATUS Statement") and
[`SHOW TABLES`](show-tables.md "15.7.7.39 SHOW TABLES Statement") statements. See
[Section 15.7.7.38, “SHOW TABLE STATUS Statement”](show-table-status.md "15.7.7.38 SHOW TABLE STATUS Statement"), and
[Section 15.7.7.39, “SHOW TABLES Statement”](show-tables.md "15.7.7.39 SHOW TABLES Statement"). The following statements are
equivalent:

```sql
SELECT
    TABLE_NAME, ENGINE, VERSION, ROW_FORMAT, TABLE_ROWS, AVG_ROW_LENGTH,
    DATA_LENGTH, MAX_DATA_LENGTH, INDEX_LENGTH, DATA_FREE, AUTO_INCREMENT,
    CREATE_TIME, UPDATE_TIME, CHECK_TIME, TABLE_COLLATION, CHECKSUM,
    CREATE_OPTIONS, TABLE_COMMENT
  FROM INFORMATION_SCHEMA.TABLES
  WHERE table_schema = 'db_name'
  [AND table_name LIKE 'wild']

SHOW TABLE STATUS
  FROM db_name
  [LIKE 'wild']
```

The following statements are equivalent:

```sql
SELECT
  TABLE_NAME, TABLE_TYPE
  FROM INFORMATION_SCHEMA.TABLES
  WHERE table_schema = 'db_name'
  [AND table_name LIKE 'wild']

SHOW FULL TABLES
  FROM db_name
  [LIKE 'wild']
```
