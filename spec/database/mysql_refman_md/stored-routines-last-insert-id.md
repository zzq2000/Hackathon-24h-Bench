### 27.2.4 Stored Procedures, Functions, Triggers, and LAST\_INSERT\_ID()

Within the body of a stored routine (procedure or function) or a
trigger, the value of
[`LAST_INSERT_ID()`](information-functions.md#function_last-insert-id) changes the same
way as for statements executed outside the body of these kinds of
objects (see [Section 14.15, “Information Functions”](information-functions.md "14.15 Information Functions")). The effect
of a stored routine or trigger upon the value of
[`LAST_INSERT_ID()`](information-functions.md#function_last-insert-id) that is seen by
following statements depends on the kind of routine:

- If a stored procedure executes statements that change the
  value of [`LAST_INSERT_ID()`](information-functions.md#function_last-insert-id), the
  changed value is seen by statements that follow the procedure
  call.
- For stored functions and triggers that change the value, the
  value is restored when the function or trigger ends, so
  following statements do not see a changed value.
