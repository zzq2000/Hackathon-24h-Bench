### 12.8.6 Examples of the Effect of Collation

**Example 1: Sorting German
Umlauts**

Suppose that column `X` in table
`T` has these `latin1` column
values:

```none
Muffler
Müller
MX Systems
MySQL
```

Suppose also that the column values are retrieved using the
following statement:

```sql
SELECT X FROM T ORDER BY X COLLATE collation_name;
```

The following table shows the resulting order of the values if
we use `ORDER BY` with different collations.

| `latin1_swedish_ci` | `latin1_german1_ci` | `latin1_german2_ci` |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Muffler | Muffler | Müller |
| MX Systems | Müller | Muffler |
| Müller | MX Systems | MX Systems |
| MySQL | MySQL | MySQL |

The character that causes the different sort orders in this
example is `ü` (German
“U-umlaut”).

- The first column shows the result of the
  [`SELECT`](select.md "15.2.13 SELECT Statement") using the
  Swedish/Finnish collating rule, which says that U-umlaut
  sorts with Y.
- The second column shows the result of the
  [`SELECT`](select.md "15.2.13 SELECT Statement") using the German DIN-1
  rule, which says that U-umlaut sorts with U.
- The third column shows the result of the
  [`SELECT`](select.md "15.2.13 SELECT Statement") using the German DIN-2
  rule, which says that U-umlaut sorts with UE.

**Example 2: Searching for German
Umlauts**

Suppose that you have three tables that differ only by the
character set and collation used:

```sql
mysql> SET NAMES utf8mb4;
mysql> CREATE TABLE german1 (
         c CHAR(10)
       ) CHARACTER SET latin1 COLLATE latin1_german1_ci;
mysql> CREATE TABLE german2 (
         c CHAR(10)
       ) CHARACTER SET latin1 COLLATE latin1_german2_ci;
mysql> CREATE TABLE germanutf8 (
         c CHAR(10)
       ) CHARACTER SET utf8mb4 COLLATE utf8mb4_unicode_ci;
```

Each table contains two records:

```sql
mysql> INSERT INTO german1 VALUES ('Bar'), ('Bär');
mysql> INSERT INTO german2 VALUES ('Bar'), ('Bär');
mysql> INSERT INTO germanutf8 VALUES ('Bar'), ('Bär');
```

Two of the above collations have an `A = Ä`
equality, and one has no such equality
(`latin1_german2_ci`). For that reason,
comparisons yield the results shown here:

```sql
mysql> SELECT * FROM german1 WHERE c = 'Bär';
+------+
| c    |
+------+
| Bar  |
| Bär  |
+------+
mysql> SELECT * FROM german2 WHERE c = 'Bär';
+------+
| c    |
+------+
| Bär  |
+------+
mysql> SELECT * FROM germanutf8 WHERE c = 'Bär';
+------+
| c    |
+------+
| Bar  |
| Bär  |
+------+
```

This is not a bug but rather a consequence of the sorting
properties of `latin1_german1_ci` and
`utf8mb4_unicode_ci` (the sorting shown is done
according to the German DIN 5007 standard).
