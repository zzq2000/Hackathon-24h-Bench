#### 8.4.1.7 LDAP Pluggable Authentication

Note

LDAP pluggable authentication is an extension included in
MySQL Enterprise Edition, a commercial product. To learn more about commercial
products, see <https://www.mysql.com/products/>.

MySQL Enterprise Edition supports an authentication method that enables MySQL
Server to use LDAP (Lightweight Directory Access Protocol) to
authenticate MySQL users by accessing directory services such as
X.500. MySQL uses LDAP to fetch user, credential, and group
information.

LDAP pluggable authentication provides these capabilities:

- External authentication: LDAP authentication enables MySQL
  Server to accept connections from users defined outside the
  MySQL grant tables in LDAP directories.
- Proxy user support: LDAP authentication can return to MySQL
  a user name different from the external user name passed by
  the client program, based on the LDAP groups the external
  user is a member of. This means that an LDAP plugin can
  return the MySQL user that defines the privileges the
  external LDAP-authenticated user should have. For example,
  an LDAP user named `joe` can connect and
  have the privileges of a MySQL user named
  `developer`, if the LDAP group for
  `joe` is `developer`.
- Security: Using TLS, connections to the LDAP server can be
  secure.

Server and client plugins are available for simple and
SASL-based LDAP authentication. On Microsoft Windows, the server
plugin for SASL-based LDAP authentication is not supported, but
the client plugin is.

The following tables show the plugin and library file names for
simple and SASL-based LDAP authentication. The file name suffix
might differ on your system. The files must be located in the
directory named by the
[`plugin_dir`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_plugin_dir) system variable.

**Table 8.22 Plugin and Library Names for Simple LDAP Authentication**

| Plugin or File | Plugin or File Name |
| --- | --- |
| Server-side plugin name | `authentication_ldap_simple` |
| Client-side plugin name | `mysql_clear_password` |
| Library file name | `authentication_ldap_simple.so` |

**Table 8.23 Plugin and Library Names for SASL-Based LDAP Authentication**

| Plugin or File | Plugin or File Name |
| --- | --- |
| Server-side plugin name | `authentication_ldap_sasl` |
| Client-side plugin name | `authentication_ldap_sasl_client` |
| Library file names | `authentication_ldap_sasl.so`, `authentication_ldap_sasl_client.so` |

The library files include only the
`authentication_ldap_XXX`
authentication plugins. The client-side
`mysql_clear_password` plugin is built into the
`libmysqlclient` client library.

Each server-side LDAP plugin works with a specific client-side
plugin:

- The server-side
  `authentication_ldap_simple` plugin
  performs simple LDAP authentication. For connections by
  accounts that use this plugin, client programs use the
  client-side `mysql_clear_password` plugin,
  which sends the password to the server as cleartext. No
  password hashing or encryption is used, so a secure
  connection between the MySQL client and server is
  recommended to prevent password exposure.
- The server-side `authentication_ldap_sasl`
  plugin performs SASL-based LDAP authentication. For
  connections by accounts that use this plugin, client
  programs use the client-side
  `authentication_ldap_sasl_client` plugin.
  The client-side and server-side SASL LDAP plugins use SASL
  messages for secure transmission of credentials within the
  LDAP protocol, to avoid sending the cleartext password
  between the MySQL client and server.

  Note

  On Microsoft Windows, the server plugin for SASL-based
  LDAP authentication is not supported, but the client
  plugin is supported. On other platforms, both the server
  and client plugins are supported.

The server-side LDAP authentication plugins are included only in
MySQL Enterprise Edition. They are not included in MySQL community distributions.
The client-side SASL LDAP plugin is included in all
distributions, including community distributions, and, as
mentioned previously, the client-side
`mysql_clear_password` plugin is built into the
`libmysqlclient` client library, which also is
included in all distributions. This enables clients from any
distribution to connect to a server that has the appropriate
server-side plugin loaded.

For general information about pluggable authentication in MySQL,
see [Section 8.2.17, “Pluggable Authentication”](pluggable-authentication.md "8.2.17 Pluggable Authentication"). For information
about the `mysql_clear_password` plugin, see
[Section 8.4.1.4, “Client-Side Cleartext Pluggable Authentication”](cleartext-pluggable-authentication.md "8.4.1.4 Client-Side Cleartext Pluggable Authentication"). For proxy
user information, see [Section 8.2.19, “Proxy Users”](proxy-users.md "8.2.19 Proxy Users").

Note

If your system supports PAM and permits LDAP as a PAM
authentication method, another way to use LDAP for MySQL user
authentication is to use the server-side
`authentication_pam` plugin. See
[Section 8.4.1.5, “PAM Pluggable Authentication”](pam-pluggable-authentication.md "8.4.1.5 PAM Pluggable Authentication").

##### Prerequisites for LDAP Pluggable Authentication

To use LDAP pluggable authentication for MySQL, these
prerequisites must be satisfied:

- An LDAP server must be available for the LDAP
  authentication plugins to communicate with.
- LDAP users to be authenticated by MySQL must be present in
  the directory managed by the LDAP server.
- An LDAP client library must be available on systems where
  the server-side
  `authentication_ldap_sasl` or
  `authentication_ldap_simple` plugin is
  used. Currently, supported libraries are the Windows
  native LDAP library, or the OpenLDAP library on
  non-Windows systems.
- To use SASL-based LDAP authentication:

  - The LDAP server must be configured to communicate with
    a SASL server.
  - A SASL client library must be available on systems
    where the client-side
    `authentication_ldap_sasl_client`
    plugin is used. Currently, the only supported library
    is the Cyrus SASL library.
  - To use a particular SASL authentication method, any
    other services required by that method must be
    available. For example, to use GSSAPI/Kerberos, a
    GSSAPI library and Kerberos services must be
    available.

##### How LDAP Authentication of MySQL Users Works

This section provides an overview of how MySQL and LDAP work
together to authenticate MySQL users. For examples showing how
to set up MySQL accounts to use specific LDAP authentication
plugins, see
[Using LDAP Pluggable Authentication](ldap-pluggable-authentication.md#ldap-pluggable-authentication-usage "Using LDAP Pluggable Authentication"). For
information about authentication methods available to the LDAP
plugins, see
[LDAP Authentication Methods](ldap-pluggable-authentication.md#ldap-pluggable-authentication-auth-methods "LDAP Authentication Methods").

The client connects to the MySQL server, providing the MySQL
client user name and a password:

- For simple LDAP authentication, the client-side and
  server-side plugins communicate the password as cleartext.
  A secure connection between the MySQL client and server is
  recommended to prevent password exposure.
- For SASL-based LDAP authentication, the client-side and
  server-side plugins avoid sending the cleartext password
  between the MySQL client and server. For example, the
  plugins might use SASL messages for secure transmission of
  credentials within the LDAP protocol. For the GSSAPI
  authentication method, the client-side and server-side
  plugins communicate securely using Kerberos without using
  LDAP messages directly.

If the client user name and host name match no MySQL account,
the connection is rejected.

If there is a matching MySQL account, authentication against
LDAP occurs. The LDAP server looks for an entry matching the
user and authenticates the entry against the LDAP password:

- If the MySQL account names an LDAP user distinguished name
  (DN), LDAP authentication uses that value and the LDAP
  password provided by the client. (To associate an LDAP
  user DN with a MySQL account, include a
  `BY` clause that specifies an
  authentication string in the [`CREATE
  USER`](create-user.md "15.7.1.3 CREATE USER Statement") statement that creates the account.)
- If the MySQL account names no LDAP user DN, LDAP
  authentication uses the user name and LDAP password
  provided by the client. In this case, the authentication
  plugin first binds to the LDAP server using the root DN
  and password as credentials to find the user DN based on
  the client user name, then authenticates that user DN
  against the LDAP password. This bind using the root
  credentials fails if the root DN and password are set to
  incorrect values, or are empty (not set) and the LDAP
  server does not permit anonymous connections.

If the LDAP server finds no match or multiple matches,
authentication fails and the client connection is rejected.

If the LDAP server finds a single match, LDAP authentication
succeeds (assuming that the password is correct), the LDAP
server returns the LDAP entry, and the authentication plugin
determines the name of the authenticated user based on that
entry:

- If the LDAP entry has a group attribute (by default, the
  `cn` attribute), the plugin returns its
  value as the authenticated user name.
- If the LDAP entry has no group attribute, the
  authentication plugin returns the client user name as the
  authenticated user name.

The MySQL server compares the client user name with the
authenticated user name to determine whether proxying occurs
for the client session:

- If the names are the same, no proxying occurs: The MySQL
  account matching the client user name is used for
  privilege checking.
- If the names differ, proxying occurs: MySQL looks for an
  account matching the authenticated user name. That account
  becomes the proxied user, which is used for privilege
  checking. The MySQL account that matched the client user
  name is treated as the external proxy user.

##### Installing LDAP Pluggable Authentication

This section describes how to install the server-side LDAP
authentication plugins. For general information about
installing plugins, see [Section 7.6.1, “Installing and Uninstalling Plugins”](plugin-loading.md "7.6.1 Installing and Uninstalling Plugins").

To be usable by the server, the plugin library files must be
located in the MySQL plugin directory (the directory named by
the [`plugin_dir`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_plugin_dir) system
variable). If necessary, configure the plugin directory
location by setting the value of
[`plugin_dir`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_plugin_dir) at server startup.

The server-side plugin library file base names are
`authentication_ldap_simple` and
`authentication_ldap_sasl`. The file name
suffix differs per platform (for example,
`.so` for Unix and Unix-like systems,
`.dll` for Windows).

Note

On Microsoft Windows, the server plugin for SASL-based LDAP
authentication is not supported, but the client plugin is
supported. On other platforms, both the server and client
plugins are supported.

To load the plugins at server startup, use
[`--plugin-load-add`](server-options.md#option_mysqld_plugin-load-add) options to
name the library files that contain them. With this
plugin-loading method, the options must be given each time the
server starts. Also, specify values for any plugin-provided
system variables you wish to configure.

Each server-side LDAP plugin exposes a set of system variables
that enable its operation to be configured. Setting most of
these is optional, but you must set the variables that specify
the LDAP server host (so the plugin knows where to connect)
and base distinguished name for LDAP bind operations (to limit
the scope of searches and obtain faster searches). For details
about all LDAP system variables, see
[Section 8.4.1.13, “Pluggable Authentication System Variables”](pluggable-authentication-system-variables.md "8.4.1.13 Pluggable Authentication System Variables").

To load the plugins and set the LDAP server host and base
distinguished name for LDAP bind operations, put lines such as
these in your `my.cnf` file, adjusting the
`.so` suffix for your platform as
necessary:

```ini
[mysqld]
plugin-load-add=authentication_ldap_simple.so
authentication_ldap_simple_server_host=127.0.0.1
authentication_ldap_simple_bind_base_dn="dc=example,dc=com"
plugin-load-add=authentication_ldap_sasl.so
authentication_ldap_sasl_server_host=127.0.0.1
authentication_ldap_sasl_bind_base_dn="dc=example,dc=com"
```

After modifying `my.cnf`, restart the
server to cause the new settings to take effect.

Alternatively, to load the plugins at runtime, use these
statements, adjusting the `.so` suffix for
your platform as necessary:

```sql
INSTALL PLUGIN authentication_ldap_simple
  SONAME 'authentication_ldap_simple.so';
INSTALL PLUGIN authentication_ldap_sasl
  SONAME 'authentication_ldap_sasl.so';
```

[`INSTALL PLUGIN`](install-plugin.md "15.7.4.4 INSTALL PLUGIN Statement") loads the plugin
immediately, and also registers it in the
`mysql.plugins` system table to cause the
server to load it for each subsequent normal startup without
the need for [`--plugin-load-add`](server-options.md#option_mysqld_plugin-load-add).

After installing the plugins at runtime, the system variables
that they expose become available and you can add settings for
them to your `my.cnf` file to configure the
plugins for subsequent restarts. For example:

```ini
[mysqld]
authentication_ldap_simple_server_host=127.0.0.1
authentication_ldap_simple_bind_base_dn="dc=example,dc=com"
authentication_ldap_sasl_server_host=127.0.0.1
authentication_ldap_sasl_bind_base_dn="dc=example,dc=com"
```

After modifying `my.cnf`, restart the
server to cause the new settings to take effect.

To set and persist each value at runtime rather than at
startup, use these statements:

```sql
SET PERSIST authentication_ldap_simple_server_host='127.0.0.1';
SET PERSIST authentication_ldap_simple_bind_base_dn='dc=example,dc=com';
SET PERSIST authentication_ldap_sasl_server_host='127.0.0.1';
SET PERSIST authentication_ldap_sasl_bind_base_dn='dc=example,dc=com';
```

[`SET
PERSIST`](set-variable.md "15.7.6.1 SET Syntax for Variable Assignment") sets a value for the running MySQL instance.
It also saves the value, causing it to carry over to
subsequent server restarts. To change a value for the running
MySQL instance without having it carry over to subsequent
restarts, use the `GLOBAL` keyword rather
than `PERSIST`. See
[Section 15.7.6.1, “SET Syntax for Variable Assignment”](set-variable.md "15.7.6.1 SET Syntax for Variable Assignment").

To verify plugin installation, examine the Information Schema
[`PLUGINS`](information-schema-plugins-table.md "28.3.22 The INFORMATION_SCHEMA PLUGINS Table") table or use the
[`SHOW PLUGINS`](show-plugins.md "15.7.7.25 SHOW PLUGINS Statement") statement (see
[Section 7.6.2, “Obtaining Server Plugin Information”](obtaining-plugin-information.md "7.6.2 Obtaining Server Plugin Information")). For example:

```sql
mysql> SELECT PLUGIN_NAME, PLUGIN_STATUS
       FROM INFORMATION_SCHEMA.PLUGINS
       WHERE PLUGIN_NAME LIKE '%ldap%';
+----------------------------+---------------+
| PLUGIN_NAME                | PLUGIN_STATUS |
+----------------------------+---------------+
| authentication_ldap_sasl   | ACTIVE        |
| authentication_ldap_simple | ACTIVE        |
+----------------------------+---------------+
```

If a plugin fails to initialize, check the server error log
for diagnostic messages.

To associate MySQL accounts with an LDAP plugin, see
[Using LDAP Pluggable Authentication](ldap-pluggable-authentication.md#ldap-pluggable-authentication-usage "Using LDAP Pluggable Authentication").

Additional Notes for SELinux

On systems running EL6 or EL that have SELinux enabled,
changes to the SELinux policy are required to enable the
MySQL LDAP plugins to communicate with the LDAP service:

1. Create a file `mysqlldap.te` with
   these contents:

   ```simple
   module mysqlldap 1.0;

   require {
           type ldap_port_t;
           type mysqld_t;
           class tcp_socket name_connect;
   }

   #============= mysqld_t ==============

   allow mysqld_t ldap_port_t:tcp_socket name_connect;
   ```
2. Compile the security policy module into a binary
   representation:

   ```terminal
   checkmodule -M -m mysqlldap.te -o mysqlldap.mod
   ```
3. Create an SELinux policy module package:

   ```terminal
   semodule_package -m mysqlldap.mod  -o mysqlldap.pp
   ```
4. Install the module package:

   ```terminal
   semodule -i mysqlldap.pp
   ```
5. When the SELinux policy changes have been made, restart
   the MySQL server:

   ```terminal
   service mysqld restart
   ```

##### Uninstalling LDAP Pluggable Authentication

The method used to uninstall the LDAP authentication plugins
depends on how you installed them:

- If you installed the plugins at server startup using
  [`--plugin-load-add`](server-options.md#option_mysqld_plugin-load-add) options,
  restart the server without those options.
- If you installed the plugins at runtime using
  [`INSTALL PLUGIN`](install-plugin.md "15.7.4.4 INSTALL PLUGIN Statement"), they remain
  installed across server restarts. To uninstall them, use
  [`UNINSTALL PLUGIN`](uninstall-plugin.md "15.7.4.6 UNINSTALL PLUGIN Statement"):

  ```sql
  UNINSTALL PLUGIN authentication_ldap_simple;
  UNINSTALL PLUGIN authentication_ldap_sasl;
  ```

In addition, remove from your `my.cnf` file
any startup options that set LDAP plugin-related system
variables. If you used
[`SET
PERSIST`](set-variable.md "15.7.6.1 SET Syntax for Variable Assignment") to persist LDAP system variables, use
[`RESET PERSIST`](reset-persist.md "15.7.8.7 RESET PERSIST Statement") to remove the
settings.

##### LDAP Pluggable Authentication and ldap.conf

For installations that use OpenLDAP, the
`ldap.conf` file provides global defaults
for LDAP clients. Options can be set in this file to affect
LDAP clients, including the LDAP authentication plugins.
OpenLDAP uses configuration options in this order of
precedence:

- Configuration specified by the LDAP client.
- Configuration specified in the
  `ldap.conf` file. To disable use of
  this file, set the `LDAPNOINIT`
  environment variable.
- OpenLDAP library built-in defaults.

If the library defaults or `ldap.conf`
values do not yield appropriate option values, an LDAP
authentication plugin may be able to set related variables to
affect the LDAP configuration directly. For example, LDAP
plugins can override `ldap.conf` for
parameters such as these:

- TLS configuration: System variables are available to
  enable TLS and control CA configuration, such as
  [`authentication_ldap_simple_tls`](pluggable-authentication-system-variables.md#sysvar_authentication_ldap_simple_tls)
  and
  [`authentication_ldap_simple_ca_path`](pluggable-authentication-system-variables.md#sysvar_authentication_ldap_simple_ca_path)
  for simple LDAP authentication, and
  [`authentication_ldap_sasl_tls`](pluggable-authentication-system-variables.md#sysvar_authentication_ldap_sasl_tls)
  and
  [`authentication_ldap_sasl_ca_path`](pluggable-authentication-system-variables.md#sysvar_authentication_ldap_sasl_ca_path)
  for SASL LDAP authentication.
- LDAP referral. See
  [LDAP Search Referral](ldap-pluggable-authentication.md#ldap-pluggable-authentication-ldap-referral "LDAP Search Referral").

For more information about `ldap.conf`
consult the `ldap.conf(5)` man page.

##### Using LDAP Pluggable Authentication

This section describes how to enable MySQL accounts to connect
to the MySQL server using LDAP pluggable authentication. It is
assumed that the server is running with the appropriate
server-side plugins enabled, as described in
[Installing LDAP Pluggable Authentication](ldap-pluggable-authentication.md#ldap-pluggable-authentication-installation "Installing LDAP Pluggable Authentication"),
and that the appropriate client-side plugins are available on
the client host.

This section does not describe LDAP configuration or
administration. You are assumed to be familiar with those
topics.

The two server-side LDAP plugins each work with a specific
client-side plugin:

- The server-side
  `authentication_ldap_simple` plugin
  performs simple LDAP authentication. For connections by
  accounts that use this plugin, client programs use the
  client-side `mysql_clear_password`
  plugin, which sends the password to the server as
  cleartext. No password hashing or encryption is used, so a
  secure connection between the MySQL client and server is
  recommended to prevent password exposure.
- The server-side
  `authentication_ldap_sasl` plugin
  performs SASL-based LDAP authentication. For connections
  by accounts that use this plugin, client programs use the
  client-side
  `authentication_ldap_sasl_client` plugin.
  The client-side and server-side SASL LDAP plugins use SASL
  messages for secure transmission of credentials within the
  LDAP protocol, to avoid sending the cleartext password
  between the MySQL client and server.

Overall requirements for LDAP authentication of MySQL users:

- There must be an LDAP directory entry for each user to be
  authenticated.
- There must be a MySQL user account that specifies a
  server-side LDAP authentication plugin and optionally
  names the associated LDAP user distinguished name (DN).
  (To associate an LDAP user DN with a MySQL account,
  include a `BY` clause in the
  [`CREATE USER`](create-user.md "15.7.1.3 CREATE USER Statement") statement that
  creates the account.) If an account names no LDAP string,
  LDAP authentication uses the user name specified by the
  client to find the LDAP entry.
- Client programs connect using the connection method
  appropriate for the server-side authentication plugin the
  MySQL account uses. For LDAP authentication, connections
  require the MySQL user name and LDAP password. In
  addition, for accounts that use the server-side
  `authentication_ldap_simple` plugin,
  invoke client programs with the
  `--enable-cleartext-plugin` option to
  enable the client-side
  `mysql_clear_password` plugin.

The instructions here assume the following scenario:

- MySQL users `betsy` and
  `boris` authenticate to the LDAP entries
  for `betsy_ldap` and
  `boris_ldap`, respectively. (It is not
  necessary that the MySQL and LDAP user names differ. The
  use of different names in this discussion helps clarify
  whether an operation context is MySQL or LDAP.)
- LDAP entries use the `uid` attribute to
  specify user names. This may vary depending on LDAP
  server. Some LDAP servers use the `cn`
  attribute for user names rather than
  `uid`. To change the attribute, modify
  the
  [`authentication_ldap_simple_user_search_attr`](pluggable-authentication-system-variables.md#sysvar_authentication_ldap_simple_user_search_attr)
  or
  [`authentication_ldap_sasl_user_search_attr`](pluggable-authentication-system-variables.md#sysvar_authentication_ldap_sasl_user_search_attr)
  system variable appropriately.
- These LDAP entries are available in the directory managed
  by the LDAP server, to provide distinguished name values
  that uniquely identify each user:

  ```ini
  uid=betsy_ldap,ou=People,dc=example,dc=com
  uid=boris_ldap,ou=People,dc=example,dc=com
  ```
- [`CREATE USER`](create-user.md "15.7.1.3 CREATE USER Statement") statements that
  create MySQL accounts name an LDAP user in the
  `BY` clause, to indicate which LDAP entry
  the MySQL account authenticates against.

The instructions for setting up an account that uses LDAP
authentication depend on which server-side LDAP plugin is
used. The following sections describe several usage scenarios.

##### Simple LDAP Authentication (Without Proxying)

The procedure outlined in this section requires that
[`authentication_ldap_simple_group_search_attr`](pluggable-authentication-system-variables.md#sysvar_authentication_ldap_simple_group_search_attr)
be set to an empty string, like this:

```sql
SET GLOBAL.authentication_ldap_simple_group_search_attr='';
```

Otherwise, proxying is used by default.

To set up a MySQL account for simple LDAP authentication, use
a [`CREATE USER`](create-user.md "15.7.1.3 CREATE USER Statement") statement to
specify the `authentication_ldap_simple`
plugin, optionally including the LDAP user distinguished name
(DN), as shown here:

```sql
CREATE USER user
  IDENTIFIED WITH authentication_ldap_simple
  [BY 'LDAP user DN'];
```

Suppose that MySQL user `betsy` has this
entry in the LDAP directory:

```ini
uid=betsy_ldap,ou=People,dc=example,dc=com
```

Then the statement to create the MySQL account for
`betsy` looks like this:

```sql
CREATE USER 'betsy'@'localhost'
  IDENTIFIED WITH authentication_ldap_simple
  AS 'uid=betsy_ldap,ou=People,dc=example,dc=com';
```

The authentication string specified in the
`BY` clause does not include the LDAP
password. That must be provided by the client user at connect
time.

Clients connect to the MySQL server by providing the MySQL
user name and LDAP password, and by enabling the client-side
`mysql_clear_password` plugin:

```terminal
$> mysql --user=betsy --password --enable-cleartext-plugin
Enter password: betsy_ldap_password
```

Note

The client-side `mysql_clear_password`
authentication plugin leaves the password untouched, so
client programs send it to the MySQL server as cleartext.
This enables the password to be passed as is to the LDAP
server. A cleartext password is necessary to use the
server-side LDAP library without SASL, but may be a security
problem in some configurations. These measures minimize the
risk:

- To make inadvertent use of the
  `mysql_clear_password` plugin less
  likely, MySQL clients must explicitly enable it (for
  example, with the
  `--enable-cleartext-plugin` option). See
  [Section 8.4.1.4, “Client-Side Cleartext Pluggable Authentication”](cleartext-pluggable-authentication.md "8.4.1.4 Client-Side Cleartext Pluggable Authentication").
- To avoid password exposure with the
  `mysql_clear_password` plugin enabled,
  MySQL clients should connect to the MySQL server using
  an encrypted connection. See
  [Section 8.3.1, “Configuring MySQL to Use Encrypted Connections”](using-encrypted-connections.md "8.3.1 Configuring MySQL to Use Encrypted Connections").

The authentication process occurs as follows:

1. The client-side plugin sends `betsy` and
   *`betsy_password`* as the client
   user name and LDAP password to the MySQL server.
2. The connection attempt matches the
   `'betsy'@'localhost'` account. The
   server-side LDAP plugin finds that this account has an
   authentication string of
   `'uid=betsy_ldap,ou=People,dc=example,dc=com'`
   to name the LDAP user DN. The plugin sends this string and
   the LDAP password to the LDAP server.
3. The LDAP server finds the LDAP entry for
   `betsy_ldap` and the password matches, so
   LDAP authentication succeeds.
4. The LDAP entry has no group attribute, so the server-side
   plugin returns the client user name
   (`betsy`) as the authenticated user. This
   is the same user name supplied by the client, so no
   proxying occurs and the client session uses the
   `'betsy'@'localhost'` account for
   privilege checking.

Had the [`CREATE USER`](create-user.md "15.7.1.3 CREATE USER Statement") statement
contained no `BY` clause to specify the
`betsy_ldap` LDAP distinguished name,
authentication attempts would use the user name provided by
the client (in this case, `betsy`). In the
absence of an LDAP entry for `betsy`,
authentication would fail.

##### SASL-Based LDAP Authentication (Without Proxying)

The procedure outlined in this section requires that
[`authentication_ldap_sasl_group_search_attr`](pluggable-authentication-system-variables.md#sysvar_authentication_ldap_sasl_group_search_attr)
be set to an empty string, like this:

```sql
SET GLOBAL.authentication_ldap_sasl_group_search_attr='';
```

Otherwise, proxying is used by default.

To set up a MySQL account for SALS LDAP authentication, use a
[`CREATE USER`](create-user.md "15.7.1.3 CREATE USER Statement") statement to
specify the `authentication_ldap_sasl`
plugin, optionally including the LDAP user distinguished name
(DN), as shown here:

```sql
CREATE USER user
  IDENTIFIED WITH authentication_ldap_sasl
  [BY 'LDAP user DN'];
```

Suppose that MySQL user `boris` has this
entry in the LDAP directory:

```ini
uid=boris_ldap,ou=People,dc=example,dc=com
```

Then the statement to create the MySQL account for
`boris` looks like this:

```sql
CREATE USER 'boris'@'localhost'
  IDENTIFIED WITH authentication_ldap_sasl
  AS 'uid=boris_ldap,ou=People,dc=example,dc=com';
```

The authentication string specified in the
`BY` clause does not include the LDAP
password. That must be provided by the client user at connect
time.

Clients connect to the MySQL server by providing the MySQL
user name and LDAP password:

```terminal
$> mysql --user=boris --password
Enter password: boris_ldap_password
```

For the server-side
`authentication_ldap_sasl` plugin, clients
use the client-side
`authentication_ldap_sasl_client` plugin. If
a client program does not find the client-side plugin, specify
a [`--plugin-dir`](connection-options.md#option_general_plugin-dir) option that
names the directory where the plugin library file is
installed.

The authentication process for `boris` is
similar to that previously described for
`betsy` with simple LDAP authentication,
except that the client-side and server-side SASL LDAP plugins
use SASL messages for secure transmission of credentials
within the LDAP protocol, to avoid sending the cleartext
password between the MySQL client and server.

##### LDAP Authentication with Proxying

LDAP authentication plugins support proxying, enabling a user
to connect to the MySQL server as one user but assume the
privileges of a different user. This section describes basic
LDAP plugin proxy support. The LDAP plugins also support
specification of group preference and proxy user mapping; see
[LDAP Authentication Group Preference and Mapping Specification](ldap-pluggable-authentication.md#ldap-pluggable-authentication-usage-group-mapping "LDAP Authentication Group Preference and Mapping Specification").

The proxying implementation described here is based on use of
LDAP group attribute values to map connecting MySQL users who
authenticate using LDAP onto other MySQL accounts that define
different sets of privileges. Users do not connect directly
through the accounts that define the privileges. Instead, they
connect through a default proxy account authenticated with
LDAP, such that all external logins are mapped to the proxied
MySQL accounts that hold the privileges. Any user who connects
using the proxy account is mapped to one of those proxied
MySQL accounts, the privileges for which determine the
database operations permitted to the external user.

The instructions here assume the following scenario:

- LDAP entries use the `uid` and
  `cn` attributes to specify user name and
  group values, respectively. To use different user and
  group attribute names, set the appropriate plugin-specific
  system variables:

  - For the `authentication_ldap_simple`
    plugin: Set
    [`authentication_ldap_simple_user_search_attr`](pluggable-authentication-system-variables.md#sysvar_authentication_ldap_simple_user_search_attr)
    and
    [`authentication_ldap_simple_group_search_attr`](pluggable-authentication-system-variables.md#sysvar_authentication_ldap_simple_group_search_attr).
  - For the `authentication_ldap_sasl`
    plugin: Set
    [`authentication_ldap_sasl_user_search_attr`](pluggable-authentication-system-variables.md#sysvar_authentication_ldap_sasl_user_search_attr)
    and
    [`authentication_ldap_sasl_group_search_attr`](pluggable-authentication-system-variables.md#sysvar_authentication_ldap_sasl_group_search_attr).
- These LDAP entries are available in the directory managed
  by the LDAP server, to provide distinguished name values
  that uniquely identify each user:

  ```ini
  uid=basha,ou=People,dc=example,dc=com,cn=accounting
  uid=basil,ou=People,dc=example,dc=com,cn=front_office
  ```

  At connect time, the group attribute values become the
  authenticated user names, so they name the
  `accounting` and
  `front_office` proxied accounts.
- The examples assume use of SASL LDAP authentication. Make
  the appropriate adjustments for simple LDAP
  authentication.

Create the default proxy MySQL account:

```sql
CREATE USER ''@'%'
  IDENTIFIED WITH authentication_ldap_sasl;
```

The proxy account definition has no `AS
'auth_string'` clause to
name an LDAP user DN. Thus:

- When a client connects, the client user name becomes the
  LDAP user name to search for.
- The matching LDAP entry is expected to include a group
  attribute naming the proxied MySQL account that defines
  the privileges the client should have.

Note

If your MySQL installation has anonymous users, they might
conflict with the default proxy user. For more information
about this issue, and ways of dealing with it, see
[Default Proxy User and Anonymous User Conflicts](proxy-users.md#proxy-users-conflicts "Default Proxy User and Anonymous User Conflicts").

Create the proxied accounts and grant to each one the
privileges it should have:

```sql
CREATE USER 'accounting'@'localhost'
  IDENTIFIED WITH mysql_no_login;
CREATE USER 'front_office'@'localhost'
  IDENTIFIED WITH mysql_no_login;

GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES
  ON accountingdb.*
  TO 'accounting'@'localhost';
GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES
  ON frontdb.*
  TO 'front_office'@'localhost';
```

The proxied accounts use the `mysql_no_login`
authentication plugin to prevent clients from using the
accounts to log in directly to the MySQL server. Instead,
users who authenticate using LDAP are expected to use the
default `''@'%'` proxy account. (This assumes
that the `mysql_no_login` plugin is
installed. For instructions, see
[Section 8.4.1.9, “No-Login Pluggable Authentication”](no-login-pluggable-authentication.md "8.4.1.9 No-Login Pluggable Authentication").) For
alternative methods of protecting proxied accounts against
direct use, see
[Preventing Direct Login to Proxied Accounts](proxy-users.md#preventing-proxied-account-direct-login "Preventing Direct Login to Proxied Accounts").

Grant to the proxy account the
[`PROXY`](privileges-provided.md#priv_proxy) privilege for each
proxied account:

```sql
GRANT PROXY
  ON 'accounting'@'localhost'
  TO ''@'%';
GRANT PROXY
  ON 'front_office'@'localhost'
  TO ''@'%';
```

Use the [**mysql**](mysql.md "6.5.1 mysql — The MySQL Command-Line Client") command-line client to
connect to the MySQL server as `basha`.

```terminal
$> mysql --user=basha --password
Enter password: basha_password (basha LDAP password)
```

Authentication occurs as follows:

1. The server authenticates the connection using the default
   `''@'%'` proxy account, for client user
   `basha`.
2. The matching LDAP entry is:

   ```ini
   uid=basha,ou=People,dc=example,dc=com,cn=accounting
   ```
3. The matching LDAP entry has group attribute
   `cn=accounting`, so
   `accounting` becomes the authenticated
   proxied user.
4. The authenticated user differs from the client user name
   `basha`, with the result that
   `basha` is treated as a proxy for
   `accounting`, and
   `basha` assumes the privileges of the
   proxied `accounting` account. The
   following query returns output as shown:

   ```sql
   mysql> SELECT USER(), CURRENT_USER(), @@proxy_user;
   +-----------------+----------------------+--------------+
   | USER()          | CURRENT_USER()       | @@proxy_user |
   +-----------------+----------------------+--------------+
   | basha@localhost | accounting@localhost | ''@'%'       |
   +-----------------+----------------------+--------------+
   ```

This demonstrates that `basha` uses the
privileges granted to the proxied
`accounting` MySQL account, and that proxying
occurs through the default proxy user account.

Now connect as `basil` instead:

```terminal
$> mysql --user=basil --password
Enter password: basil_password (basil LDAP password)
```

The authentication process for `basil` is
similar to that previously described for
`basha`:

1. The server authenticates the connection using the default
   `''@'%'` proxy account, for client user
   `basil`.
2. The matching LDAP entry is:

   ```ini
   uid=basil,ou=People,dc=example,dc=com,cn=front_office
   ```
3. The matching LDAP entry has group attribute
   `cn=front_office`, so
   `front_office` becomes the authenticated
   proxied user.
4. The authenticated user differs from the client user name
   `basil`, with the result that
   `basil` is treated as a proxy for
   `front_office`, and
   `basil` assumes the privileges of the
   proxied `front_office` account. The
   following query returns output as shown:

   ```sql
   mysql> SELECT USER(), CURRENT_USER(), @@proxy_user;
   +-----------------+------------------------+--------------+
   | USER()          | CURRENT_USER()         | @@proxy_user |
   +-----------------+------------------------+--------------+
   | basil@localhost | front_office@localhost | ''@'%'       |
   +-----------------+------------------------+--------------+
   ```

This demonstrates that `basil` uses the
privileges granted to the proxied
`front_office` MySQL account, and that
proxying occurs through the default proxy user account.

##### LDAP Authentication Group Preference and Mapping Specification

As described in
[LDAP Authentication with Proxying](ldap-pluggable-authentication.md#ldap-pluggable-authentication-usage-proxying "LDAP Authentication with Proxying"),
basic LDAP authentication proxying works by the principle that
the plugin uses the first group name returned by the LDAP
server as the MySQL proxied user account name. This simple
capability does not enable specifying any preference about
which group name to use if the LDAP server returns multiple
group names, or specifying any name other than the group name
as the proxied user name.

As of MySQL 8.0.14, for MySQL accounts that use LDAP
authentication, the authentication string can specify the
following information to enable greater proxying flexibility:

- A list of groups in preference order, such that the plugin
  uses the first group name in the list that matches a group
  returned by the LDAP server.
- A mapping from group names to proxied user names, such
  that a group name when matched can provide a specified
  name to use as the proxied user. This provides an
  alternative to using the group name as the proxied user.

Consider the following MySQL proxy account definition:

```sql
CREATE USER ''@'%'
  IDENTIFIED WITH authentication_ldap_sasl
  AS '+ou=People,dc=example,dc=com#grp1=usera,grp2,grp3=userc';
```

The authentication string has a user DN suffix
`ou=People,dc=example,dc=com` prefixed by the
`+` character. Thus, as described in
[LDAP Authentication User DN Suffixes](ldap-pluggable-authentication.md#ldap-pluggable-authentication-usage-user-dn-suffix "LDAP Authentication User DN Suffixes"),
the full user DN is constructed from the user DN suffix as
specified, plus the client user name as the
`uid` attribute.

The remaining part of the authentication string begins with
`#`, which signifies the beginning of group
preference and mapping information. This part of the
authentication string lists group names in the order
`grp1`, `grp2`,
`grp3`. The LDAP plugin compares that list
with the set of group names returned by the LDAP server,
looking in list order for a match against the returned names.
The plugin uses the first match, or if there is no match,
authentication fails.

Suppose that the LDAP server returns groups
`grp3`, `grp2`, and
`grp7`. The LDAP plugin uses
`grp2` because it is the first group in the
authentication string that matches, even though it is not the
first group returned by the LDAP server. If the LDAP server
returns `grp4`, `grp2`, and
`grp1`, the plugin uses
`grp1` even though `grp2`
also matches. `grp1` has a precedence higher
than `grp2` because it is listed earlier in
the authentication string.

Assuming that the plugin finds a group name match, it performs
mapping from that group name to the MySQL proxied user name,
if there is one. For the example proxy account, mapping occurs
as follows:

- If the matching group name is `grp1` or
  `grp3`, those are associated in the
  authentication string with user names
  `usera` and `userc`,
  respectively. The plugin uses the corresponding associated
  user name as the proxied user name.
- If the matching group name is `grp2`,
  there is no associated user name in the authentication
  string. The plugin uses `grp2` as the
  proxied user name.

If the LDAP server returns a group in DN format, the LDAP
plugin parses the group DN to extract the group name from it.

To specify LDAP group preference and mapping information,
these principles apply:

- Begin the group preference and mapping part of the
  authentication string with a `#` prefix
  character.
- The group preference and mapping specification is a list
  of one or more items, separated by commas. Each item has
  the form
  `group_name=user_name`
  or *`group_name`*. Items should be
  listed in group name preference order. For a group name
  selected by the plugin as a match from set of group names
  returned by the LDAP server, the two syntaxes differ in
  effect as follows:

  - For an item specified as
    `group_name=user_name`
    (with a user name), the group name maps to the user
    name, which is used as the MySQL proxied user name.
  - For an item specified as
    *`group_name`* (with no user
    name), the group name is used as the MySQL proxied
    user name.
- To quote a group or user name that contains special
  characters such as space, surround it by double quote
  (`"`) characters. For example, if an item
  has group and user names of `my group
  name` and `my user name`, it
  must be written in a group mapping using quotes:

  ```none
  "my group name"="my user name"
  ```

  If an item has group and user names of
  `my_group_name` and
  `my_user_name` (which contain no special
  characters), it may but need not be written using quotes.
  Any of the following are valid:

  ```none
  my_group_name=my_user_name
  my_group_name="my_user_name"
  "my_group_name"=my_user_name
  "my_group_name"="my_user_name"
  ```
- To escape a character, precede it by a backslash
  (`\`). This is useful particularly to
  include a literal double quote or backslash, which are
  otherwise not included literally.
- A user DN need not be present in the authentication
  string, but if present, it must precede the group
  preference and mapping part. A user DN can be given as a
  full user DN, or as a user DN suffix with a
  `+` prefix character. (See
  [LDAP Authentication User DN Suffixes](ldap-pluggable-authentication.md#ldap-pluggable-authentication-usage-user-dn-suffix "LDAP Authentication User DN Suffixes").)

##### LDAP Authentication User DN Suffixes

LDAP authentication plugins permit the authentication string
that provides user DN information to begin with a
`+` prefix character:

- In the absence of a `+` character, the
  authentication string value is treated as is without
  modification.
- If the authentication string begins with
  `+`, the plugin constructs the full user
  DN value from the user name sent by the client, together
  with the DN specified in the authentication string (with
  the `+` removed). In the constructed DN,
  the client user name becomes the value of the attribute
  that specifies LDAP user names. This is
  `uid` by default; to change the
  attribute, modify the appropriate system variable
  ([`authentication_ldap_simple_user_search_attr`](pluggable-authentication-system-variables.md#sysvar_authentication_ldap_simple_user_search_attr)
  or
  [`authentication_ldap_sasl_user_search_attr`](pluggable-authentication-system-variables.md#sysvar_authentication_ldap_sasl_user_search_attr)).
  The authentication string is stored as given in the
  `mysql.user` system table, with the full
  user DN constructed on the fly before authentication.

This account authentication string does not have
`+` at the beginning, so it is taken as the
full user DN:

```sql
CREATE USER 'baldwin'
  IDENTIFIED WITH authentication_ldap_simple
  AS 'uid=admin,ou=People,dc=example,dc=com';
```

The client connects with the user name specified in the
account (`baldwin`). In this case, that name
is not used because the authentication string has no prefix
and thus fully specifies the user DN.

This account authentication string does have
`+` at the beginning, so it is taken as just
part of the user DN:

```sql
CREATE USER 'accounting'
  IDENTIFIED WITH authentication_ldap_simple
  AS '+ou=People,dc=example,dc=com';
```

The client connects with the user name specified in the
account (`accounting`), which in this case is
used as the `uid` attribute together with the
authentication string to construct the user DN:
`uid=accounting,ou=People,dc=example,dc=com`

The accounts in the preceding examples have a nonempty user
name, so the client always connects to the MySQL server using
the same name as specified in the account definition. If an
account has an empty user name, such as the default anonymous
`''@'%'` proxy account described in
[LDAP Authentication with Proxying](ldap-pluggable-authentication.md#ldap-pluggable-authentication-usage-proxying "LDAP Authentication with Proxying"),
clients might connect to the MySQL server with varying user
names. But the principle is the same: If the authentication
string begins with `+`, the plugin uses the
user name sent by the client together with the authentication
string to construct the user DN.

##### LDAP Authentication Methods

The LDAP authentication plugins use a configurable
authentication method. The appropriate system variable and
available method choices are plugin-specific:

- For the `authentication_ldap_simple`
  plugin: Set the
  [`authentication_ldap_simple_auth_method_name`](pluggable-authentication-system-variables.md#sysvar_authentication_ldap_simple_auth_method_name)
  system variable to configure the method. The permitted
  choices are `SIMPLE` and
  `AD-FOREST`.
- For the `authentication_ldap_sasl`
  plugin: Set the
  [`authentication_ldap_sasl_auth_method_name`](pluggable-authentication-system-variables.md#sysvar_authentication_ldap_sasl_auth_method_name)
  system variable to configure the method. The permitted
  choices are `SCRAM-SHA-1`,
  `SCRAM-SHA-256`, and
  `GSSAPI`. (To determine which SASL LDAP
  methods are actually available on the host system, check
  the value of the
  [`Authentication_ldap_sasl_supported_methods`](server-status-variables.md#statvar_Authentication_ldap_sasl_supported_methods)
  status variable.)

See the system variable descriptions for information about
each permitted method. Also, depending on the method,
additional configuration may be needed, as described in the
following sections.

##### The GSSAPI/Kerberos Authentication Method

Generic Security Service Application Program Interface
(GSSAPI) is a security abstraction interface. Kerberos is an
instance of a specific security protocol that can be used
through that abstract interface. Using GSSAPI, applications
authenticate to Kerberos to obtain service credentials, then
use those credentials in turn to enable secure access to other
services.

One such service is LDAP, which is used by the client-side and
server-side SASL LDAP authentication plugins. When the
[`authentication_ldap_sasl_auth_method_name`](pluggable-authentication-system-variables.md#sysvar_authentication_ldap_sasl_auth_method_name)
system variable is set to `GSSAPI`, these
plugins use the GSSAPI/Kerberos authentication method. In this
case, the plugins communicate securely using Kerberos without
using LDAP messages directly. The server-side plugin then
communicates with the LDAP server to interpret LDAP
authentication messages and retrieve LDAP groups.

GSSAPI/Kerberos is supported as an LDAP authentication method
for MySQL servers and clients on Linux. It is useful in Linux
environments where applications have access to LDAP through
Microsoft Active Directory, which has Kerberos enabled by
default.

The following discussion provides information about the
configuration requirements for using the GSSAPI method.
Familiarity is assumed with Kerberos concepts and operation.
The following list briefly defines several common Kerberos
terms. You may also find the Glossary section of
[RFC
4120](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4120) helpful.

- [Principal](glossary.md#glos_principal "principal"): A named
  entity, such as a user or server.
- [KDC](glossary.md#glos_key_distribution_center "key distribution center"):
  The key distribution center, comprising the AS and TGS:

  - [AS](glossary.md#glos_authentication_server "authentication server"):
    The authentication server; provides the initial
    ticket-granting ticket needed to obtain additional
    tickets.
  - [TGS](glossary.md#glos_ticket_granting_server "ticket-granting server"):
    The ticket-granting server; provides additional
    tickets to Kerberos clients that possess a valid TGT.
- [TGT](glossary.md#glos_ticket_granting_ticket "ticket-granting ticket"):
  The ticket-granting ticket; presented to the TGS to obtain
  service tickets for service access.

LDAP authentication using Kerberos requires both a KDC server
and an LDAP server. This requirement can be satisfied in
different ways:

- Active Directory includes both servers, with Kerberos
  authentication enabled by default in the Active Directory
  LDAP server.
- OpenLDAP provides an LDAP server, but a separate KDC
  server may be needed, with additional Kerberos setup
  required.

Kerberos must also be available on the client host. A client
contacts the AS using a password to obtain a TGT. The client
then uses the TGT to obtain access from the TGS to other
services, such as LDAP.

The following sections discuss the configuration steps to use
GSSAPI/Kerberos for SASL LDAP authentication in MySQL:

- [Verify Kerberos and LDAP Availability](ldap-pluggable-authentication.md#ldap-gssapi-kerberos-setup "Verify Kerberos and LDAP Availability")
- [Configure the Server-Side SASL LDAP Authentication Plugin for GSSAPI/Kerberos](ldap-pluggable-authentication.md#ldap-gssapi-ldap-setup "Configure the Server-Side SASL LDAP Authentication Plugin for GSSAPI/Kerberos")
- [Create a MySQL Account That Uses GSSAPI/Kerberos for LDAP Authentication](ldap-pluggable-authentication.md#ldap-gssapi-mysql-account-setup "Create a MySQL Account That Uses GSSAPI/Kerberos for LDAP Authentication")
- [Use the MySQL Account to Connect to the MySQL Server](ldap-pluggable-authentication.md#ldap-gssapi-mysql-client-usage "Use the MySQL Account to Connect to the MySQL Server")
- [Client Configuration Parameters for LDAP Authentication](ldap-pluggable-authentication.md#ldap-gssapi-mysql-client-config-parameters "Client Configuration Parameters for LDAP Authentication")

###### Verify Kerberos and LDAP Availability

The following example shows how to test availability of
Kerberos in Active Directory. The example makes these
assumptions:

- Active Directory is running on the host named
  `ldap_auth.example.com` with IP address
  `198.51.100.10`.
- MySQL-related Kerberos authentication and LDAP lookups use
  the `MYSQL.LOCAL` domain.
- A principal named `bredon@MYSQL.LOCAL` is
  registered with the KDC. (In later discussion, this
  principal name is also associated with the MySQL account
  that authenticates to the MySQL server using
  GSSAPI/Kerberos.)

With those assumptions satisfied, follow this procedure:

1. Verify that the Kerberos library is installed and
   configured correctly in the operating system. For example,
   to configure a `MYSQL.LOCAL` domain for
   use during MySQL authentication, the
   `/etc/krb5.conf` Kerberos configuration
   file should contain something like this:

   ```ini
   [realms]
     MYSQL.LOCAL = {
       kdc = ldap_auth.example.com
       admin_server = ldap_auth.example.com
       default_domain = MYSQL.LOCAL
     }
   ```
2. You may need to add an entry to
   `/etc/hosts` for the server host:

   ```simple
   198.51.100.10 ldap_auth ldap_auth.example.com
   ```
3. Check whether Kerberos authentication works correctly:

   1. Use **kinit** to authenticate to
      Kerberos:

      ```terminal
      $> kinit bredon@MYSQL.LOCAL
      Password for bredon@MYSQL.LOCAL: (enter password here)
      ```

      The command authenticates for the Kerberos principal
      named `bredon@MYSQL.LOCAL`. Enter the
      principal's password when the command prompts for
      it. The KDC returns a TGT that is cached on the client
      side for use by other Kerberos-aware applications.
   2. Use **klist** to check whether the TGT
      was obtained correctly. The output should be similar
      to this:

      ```terminal
      $> klist
      Ticket cache: FILE:/tmp/krb5cc_244306
      Default principal: bredon@MYSQL.LOCAL

      Valid starting       Expires              Service principal
      03/23/2021 08:18:33  03/23/2021 18:18:33  krbtgt/MYSQL.LOCAL@MYSQL.LOCAL
      ```
4. Check whether **ldapsearch** works with the
   Kerberos TGT using this command, which searches for users
   in the `MYSQL.LOCAL` domain:

   ```terminal
   ldapsearch -h 198.51.100.10 -Y GSSAPI -b "dc=MYSQL,dc=LOCAL"
   ```

###### Configure the Server-Side SASL LDAP Authentication Plugin for GSSAPI/Kerberos

Assuming that the LDAP server is accessible through Kerberos
as just described, configure the server-side SASL LDAP
authentication plugin to use the GSSAPI/Kerberos
authentication method. (For general LDAP plugin installation
information, see
[Installing LDAP Pluggable Authentication](ldap-pluggable-authentication.md#ldap-pluggable-authentication-installation "Installing LDAP Pluggable Authentication").)
Here is an example of plugin-related settings the server
`my.cnf` file might contain:

```ini
[mysqld]
plugin-load-add=authentication_ldap_sasl.so
authentication_ldap_sasl_auth_method_name="GSSAPI"
authentication_ldap_sasl_server_host=198.51.100.10
authentication_ldap_sasl_server_port=389
authentication_ldap_sasl_bind_root_dn="cn=admin,cn=users,dc=MYSQL,dc=LOCAL"
authentication_ldap_sasl_bind_root_pwd="password"
authentication_ldap_sasl_bind_base_dn="cn=users,dc=MYSQL,dc=LOCAL"
authentication_ldap_sasl_user_search_attr="sAMAccountName"
```

Those option file settings configure the SASL LDAP plugin as
follows:

- The [`--plugin-load-add`](server-options.md#option_mysqld_plugin-load-add)
  option loads the plugin (adjust the
  `.so` suffix for your platform as
  necessary). If you loaded the plugin previously using an
  [`INSTALL PLUGIN`](install-plugin.md "15.7.4.4 INSTALL PLUGIN Statement") statement,
  this option is unnecessary.
- [`authentication_ldap_sasl_auth_method_name`](pluggable-authentication-system-variables.md#sysvar_authentication_ldap_sasl_auth_method_name)
  must be set to `GSSAPI` to use
  GSSAPI/Kerberos as the SASL LDAP authentication method.
- [`authentication_ldap_sasl_server_host`](pluggable-authentication-system-variables.md#sysvar_authentication_ldap_sasl_server_host)
  and
  [`authentication_ldap_sasl_server_port`](pluggable-authentication-system-variables.md#sysvar_authentication_ldap_sasl_server_port)
  indicate the IP address and port number of the Active
  Directory server host for authentication.
- [`authentication_ldap_sasl_bind_root_dn`](pluggable-authentication-system-variables.md#sysvar_authentication_ldap_sasl_bind_root_dn)
  and
  [`authentication_ldap_sasl_bind_root_pwd`](pluggable-authentication-system-variables.md#sysvar_authentication_ldap_sasl_bind_root_pwd)
  configure the root DN and password for group search
  capability. This capability is required, but users may not
  have privileges to search. In such cases, it is necessary
  to provide root DN information:

  - In the DN option value, `admin`
    should be the name of an administrative LDAP account
    that has privileges to perform user searches.
  - In the password option value,
    *`password`* should be the
    `admin` account password.
- [`authentication_ldap_sasl_bind_base_dn`](pluggable-authentication-system-variables.md#sysvar_authentication_ldap_sasl_bind_base_dn)
  indicates the user DN base path, so that searches look for
  users in the `MYSQL.LOCAL` domain.
- [`authentication_ldap_sasl_user_search_attr`](pluggable-authentication-system-variables.md#sysvar_authentication_ldap_sasl_user_search_attr)
  specifies a standard Active Directory search attribute,
  `sAMAccountName`. This attribute is used
  in searches to match logon names; attribute values are not
  the same as the user DN values.

###### Create a MySQL Account That Uses GSSAPI/Kerberos for LDAP Authentication

MySQL authentication using the SASL LDAP authentication plugin
with the GSSAPI/Kerberos method is based on a user that is a
Kerberos principal. The following discussion uses a principal
named `bredon@MYSQL.LOCAL` as this user,
which must be registered in several places:

- The Kerberos administrator should register the user name
  as a Kerberos principal. This name should include a domain
  name. Clients use the principal name and password to
  authenticate with Kerberos and obtain a TGT.
- The LDAP administrator should register the user name in an
  LDAP entry. For example:

  ```none
  uid=bredon,dc=MYSQL,dc=LOCAL
  ```

  Note

  In Active Directory (which uses Kerberos as the default
  authentication method), creating a user creates both the
  Kerberos principal and the LDAP entry.
- The MySQL DBA should create an account that has the
  Kerberos principal name as the user name and that
  authenticates using the SASL LDAP plugin.

Assume that the Kerberos principal and LDAP entry have been
registered by the appropriate service administrators, and
that, as previously described in
[Installing LDAP Pluggable Authentication](ldap-pluggable-authentication.md#ldap-pluggable-authentication-installation "Installing LDAP Pluggable Authentication"),
and [Configure the Server-Side SASL LDAP Authentication Plugin for GSSAPI/Kerberos](ldap-pluggable-authentication.md#ldap-gssapi-ldap-setup "Configure the Server-Side SASL LDAP Authentication Plugin for GSSAPI/Kerberos"), the MySQL server
has been started with appropriate configuration settings for
the server-side SASL LDAP plugin. The MySQL DBA then creates a
MySQL account that corresponds to the Kerberos principal name,
including the domain name.

Note

The SASL LDAP plugin uses a constant user DN for Kerberos
authentication and ignores any user DN configured from
MySQL. This has certain implications:

- For any MySQL account that uses GSSAPI/Kerberos
  authentication, the authentication string in
  [`CREATE USER`](create-user.md "15.7.1.3 CREATE USER Statement") or
  [`ALTER USER`](alter-user.md "15.7.1.1 ALTER USER Statement") statements
  should contain no user DN because it has no effect.
- Because the authentication string contains no user DN,
  it should contain group mapping information, to enable
  the user to be handled as a proxy user that is mapped
  onto the desired proxied user. For information about
  proxying with the LDAP authentication plugin, see
  [LDAP Authentication with Proxying](ldap-pluggable-authentication.md#ldap-pluggable-authentication-usage-proxying "LDAP Authentication with Proxying").

The following statements create a proxy user named
`bredon@MYSQL.LOCAL` that assumes the
privileges of the proxied user named
`proxied_krb_usr`. Other GSSAPI/Kerberos
users that should have the same privileges can similarly be
created as proxy users for the same proxied user.

```sql
-- create proxy account
CREATE USER 'bredon@MYSQL.LOCAL'
  IDENTIFIED WITH authentication_ldap_sasl
  BY '#krb_grp=proxied_krb_user';

-- create proxied account and grant its privileges;
-- use mysql_no_login plugin to prevent direct login
CREATE USER 'proxied_krb_user'
  IDENTIFIED WITH mysql_no_login;
GRANT ALL
  ON krb_user_db.*
  TO 'proxied_krb_user';

-- grant to proxy account the
-- PROXY privilege for proxied account
GRANT PROXY
  ON 'proxied_krb_user'
  TO 'bredon@MYSQL.LOCAL';
```

Observe closely the quoting for the proxy account name in the
first [`CREATE USER`](create-user.md "15.7.1.3 CREATE USER Statement") statement and
the [`GRANT
PROXY`](grant.md "15.7.1.6 GRANT Statement") statement:

- For most MySQL accounts, the user and host are separate
  parts of the account name, and thus are quoted separately
  as
  `'user_name'@'host_name'`.
- For LDAP Kerberos authentication, the user part of the
  account name includes the principal domain, so
  `'bredon@MYSQL.LOCAL'` is quoted as a
  single value. Because no host part is given, the full
  MySQL account name uses the default of
  `'%'` as the host part:
  `'bredon@MYSQL.LOCAL'@'%'`

Note

When creating an account that authenticates using the
`authentication_ldap_sasl` SASL LDAP
authentication plugin with the GSSAPI/Kerberos
authentication method, the [`CREATE
USER`](create-user.md "15.7.1.3 CREATE USER Statement") statement includes the realm as part of the
user name. This differs from creating accounts that use the
`authentication_kerberos` Kerberos plugin.
For such accounts, the [`CREATE
USER`](create-user.md "15.7.1.3 CREATE USER Statement") statement does not include the realm as part
of the user name. Instead, specify the realm as the
authentication string in the `BY` clause.
See [Create a MySQL Account That Uses Kerberos Authentication](kerberos-pluggable-authentication.md#kerberos-usage-mysql-account-setup "Create a MySQL Account That Uses Kerberos Authentication").

The proxied account uses the `mysql_no_login`
authentication plugin to prevent clients from using the
account to log in directly to the MySQL server. Instead, it is
expected that users who authenticate using LDAP use the
`bredon@MYSQL.LOCAL` proxy account. (This
assumes that the `mysql_no_login` plugin is
installed. For instructions, see
[Section 8.4.1.9, “No-Login Pluggable Authentication”](no-login-pluggable-authentication.md "8.4.1.9 No-Login Pluggable Authentication").) For
alternative methods of protecting proxied accounts against
direct use, see
[Preventing Direct Login to Proxied Accounts](proxy-users.md#preventing-proxied-account-direct-login "Preventing Direct Login to Proxied Accounts").

###### Use the MySQL Account to Connect to the MySQL Server

After a MySQL account that authenticates using GSSAPI/Kerberos
has been set up, clients can use it to connect to the MySQL
server. Kerberos authentication can take place either prior to
or at the time of MySQL client program invocation:

- Prior to invoking the MySQL client program, the client
  user can obtain a TGT from the KDC independently of MySQL.
  For example, the client user can use
  **kinit** to authenticate to Kerberos by
  providing a Kerberos principal name and the principal
  password:

  ```terminal
  $> kinit bredon@MYSQL.LOCAL
  Password for bredon@MYSQL.LOCAL: (enter password here)
  ```

  The resulting TGT is cached and becomes available for use
  by other Kerberos-aware applications, such as programs
  that use the client-side SASL LDAP authentication plugin.
  In this case, the MySQL client program authenticates to
  the MySQL server using the TGT, so invoke the client
  without specifying a user name or password:

  ```terminal
  mysql --default-auth=authentication_ldap_sasl_client
  ```

  As just described, when the TGT is cached, user-name and
  password options are not needed in the client command. If
  the command includes them anyway, they are handled as
  follows:

  - If the command includes a user name, authentication
    fails if that name does not match the principal name
    in the TGT.
  - If the command includes a password, the client-side
    plugin ignores it. Because authentication is based on
    the TGT, it can succeed *even if the
    user-provided password is incorrect*. For
    this reason, the plugin produces a warning if a valid
    TGT is found that causes a password to be ignored.
- If the Kerberos cache contains no TGT, the client-side
  SASL LDAP authentication plugin itself can obtain the TGT
  from the KDC. Invoke the client with options for the name
  and password of the Kerberos principal associated with the
  MySQL account (enter the command on a single line, then
  enter the principal password when prompted):

  ```terminal
  mysql --default-auth=authentication_ldap_sasl_client
    --user=bredon@MYSQL.LOCAL
    --password
  ```
- If the Kerberos cache contains no TGT and the client
  command specifies no principal name as the user name,
  authentication fails.

If you are uncertain whether a TGT exists, you can use
**klist** to check.

Authentication occurs as follows:

1. The client uses the TGT to authenticate using Kerberos.
2. The server finds the LDAP entry for the principal and uses
   it to authenticate the connection for the
   `bredon@MYSQL.LOCAL` MySQL proxy account.
3. The group mapping information in the proxy account
   authentication string
   (`'#krb_grp=proxied_krb_user'`) indicates
   that the authenticated proxied user should be
   `proxied_krb_user`.
4. `bredon@MYSQL.LOCAL` is treated as a
   proxy for `proxied_krb_user`, and the
   following query returns output as shown:

   ```sql
   mysql> SELECT USER(), CURRENT_USER(), @@proxy_user;
   +------------------------------+--------------------+--------------------------+
   | USER()                       | CURRENT_USER()     | @@proxy_user             |
   +------------------------------+--------------------+--------------------------+
   | bredon@MYSQL.LOCAL@localhost | proxied_krb_user@% | 'bredon@MYSQL.LOCAL'@'%' |
   +------------------------------+--------------------+--------------------------+
   ```

   The [`USER()`](information-functions.md#function_user) value indicates
   the user name used for the client command
   (`bredon@MYSQL.LOCAL`) and the host from
   which the client connected (`localhost`).

   The [`CURRENT_USER()`](information-functions.md#function_current-user) value is
   the full name of the proxied user account, which consists
   of the `proxied_krb_user` user part and
   the `%` host part.

   The
   [`@@proxy_user`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_proxy_user)
   value indicates the full name of the account used to make
   the connection to the MySQL server, which consists of the
   `bredon@MYSQL.LOCAL` user part and the
   `%` host part.

   This demonstrates that proxying occurs through the
   `bredon@MYSQL.LOCAL` proxy user account,
   and that `bredon@MYSQL.LOCAL` assumes the
   privileges granted to the
   `proxied_krb_user` proxied user account.

A TGT once obtained is cached on the client side and can be
used until it expires without specifying the password again.
However the TGT is obtained, the client-side plugin uses it to
acquire service tickets and communicate with the server-side
plugin.

Note

When the client-side authentication plugin itself obtains
the TGT, the client user may not want the TGT to be reused.
As described in
[Client Configuration Parameters for LDAP Authentication](ldap-pluggable-authentication.md#ldap-gssapi-mysql-client-config-parameters "Client Configuration Parameters for LDAP Authentication"),
the local `/etc/krb5.conf` file can be used
to cause the client-side plugin to destroy the TGT when done
with it.

The server-side plugin has no access to the TGT itself or the
Kerberos password used to obtain it.

The LDAP authentication plugins have no control over the
caching mechanism (storage in a local file, in memory, and so
forth), but Kerberos utilities such as
**kswitch** may be available for this purpose.

###### Client Configuration Parameters for LDAP Authentication

The `authentication_ldap_sasl_client`
client-side SASL LDAP plugin reads the local
`/etc/krb5.conf` file. If this file is
missing or inaccessible, an error occurs. Assuming that the
file is accessible, it can include an optional
`[appdefaults]` section to provide
information used by the plugin. Place the information within
the `mysql` part of the section. For example:

```ini
[appdefaults]
  mysql = {
    ldap_server_host = "ldap_host.example.com"
    ldap_destroy_tgt = true
  }
```

The client-side plugin recognizes these parameters in the
`mysql` section:

- The `ldap_server_host` value specifies
  the LDAP server host and can be useful when that host
  differs from the KDC server host specified in the
  `[realms]` section. By default, the
  plugin uses the KDC server host as the LDAP server host.
- The `ldap_destroy_tgt` value indicates
  whether the client-side plugin destroys the TGT after
  obtaining and using it. By default,
  `ldap_destroy_tgt` is
  `false`, but can be set to
  `true` to avoid TGT reuse. (This setting
  applies only to TGTs created by the client-side plugin,
  not TGTs created by other plugins or externally to MySQL.)

##### LDAP Search Referral

An LDAP server can be configured to delegate LDAP searches to
another LDAP server, a functionality known as LDAP referral.
Suppose that the server `a.example.com` holds
a `"dc=example,dc=com"` root DN and wishes to
delegate searches to another server
`b.example.com`. To enable this,
`a.example.com` would be configured with a
named referral object having these attributes:

```simple
dn: dc=subtree,dc=example,dc=com
objectClass: referral
objectClass: extensibleObject
dc: subtree
ref: ldap://b.example.com/dc=subtree,dc=example,dc=com
```

An issue with enabling LDAP referral is that searches can fail
with LDAP operation errors when the search base DN is the root
DN, and referral objects are not set. A MySQL DBA might wish
to avoid such referral errors for the LDAP authentication
plugins, even though LDAP referral might be set globally in
the `ldap.conf` configuration file. To
configure on a plugin-specific basis whether the LDAP server
should use LDAP referral when communicating with each plugin,
set the
[`authentication_ldap_simple_referral`](pluggable-authentication-system-variables.md#sysvar_authentication_ldap_simple_referral)
and
[`authentication_ldap_sasl_referral`](pluggable-authentication-system-variables.md#sysvar_authentication_ldap_sasl_referral)
system variables. Setting either variable to
`ON` or `OFF` causes the
corresponding LDAP authentication plugin to tell the LDAP
server whether to use referral during MySQL authentication.
Each variable has a plugin-specific effect and does not affect
other applications that communicate with the LDAP server. Both
variables are `OFF` by default.
