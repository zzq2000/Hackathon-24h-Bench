#### 25.6.14.3 NDB File System Encryption Limitations

Transparent data encryption in NDB Cluster is subject to the
following restrictions and limitations:

- The file system password must be supplied to each individual
  data node.
- File system password rotation requires an initial rolling
  restart of the data nodes; this must be performed manually,
  or by an application external to `NDB`).
- For a cluster with only a single replica
  ([`NoOfReplicas = 1`](mysql-cluster-ndbd-definition.md#ndbparam-ndbd-noofreplicas)),
  a full backup and restore is required for file system
  password rotation.
- Rotation of all data encryption keys requires an initial
  node restart.

**NDB TDE and NDB Replication.**
The use of an encrypted filesystem does not have any effect on
NDB Replication. All of the following scenarios are supported:

- Replication of an NDB Cluster having an encrypted file
  system to an NDB Cluster whose file system is not encrypted.
- Replication of an NDB Cluster whose file system is not
  encrypted to an NDB Cluster whose file system is encrypted.
- Replication of an NDB Cluster whose file system is encrypted
  to a standalone MySQL server using
  [`InnoDB`](innodb-storage-engine.md "Chapter 17 The InnoDB Storage Engine") tables which are not
  encrypted.
- Replication of an NDB Cluster with an unencrypted file
  system to a standalone MySQL server using
  `InnoDB` tables with file sytem encryption.
