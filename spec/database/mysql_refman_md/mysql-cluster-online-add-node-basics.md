#### 25.6.7.2 Adding NDB Cluster Data Nodes Online: Basic procedure

In this section, we list the basic steps required to add new
data nodes to an NDB Cluster. This procedure applies whether you
are using [**ndbd**](mysql-cluster-programs-ndbd.md "25.5.1 ndbd — The NDB Cluster Data Node Daemon") or [**ndbmtd**](mysql-cluster-programs-ndbmtd.md "25.5.3 ndbmtd — The NDB Cluster Data Node Daemon (Multi-Threaded)")
binaries for the data node processes. For a more detailed
example, see
[Section 25.6.7.3, “Adding NDB Cluster Data Nodes Online: Detailed Example”](mysql-cluster-online-add-node-example.md "25.6.7.3 Adding NDB Cluster Data Nodes Online: Detailed Example").

Assuming that you already have a running NDB Cluster, adding
data nodes online requires the following steps:

1. Edit the cluster configuration
   `config.ini` file, adding new
   `[ndbd]` sections corresponding to the
   nodes to be added. In the case where the cluster uses
   multiple management servers, these changes need to be made
   to all `config.ini` files used by the
   management servers.

   You must be careful that node IDs for any new data nodes
   added in the `config.ini` file do not
   overlap node IDs used by existing nodes. In the event that
   you have API nodes using dynamically allocated node IDs and
   these IDs match node IDs that you want to use for new data
   nodes, it is possible to force any such API nodes to
   “migrate”, as described later in this
   procedure.
2. Perform a rolling restart of all NDB Cluster management
   servers.

   Important

   All management servers must be restarted with the
   [`--reload`](mysql-cluster-programs-ndb-mgmd.md#option_ndb_mgmd_reload) or
   [`--initial`](mysql-cluster-programs-ndb-mgmd.md#option_ndb_mgmd_initial) option to force
   the reading of the new configuration.
3. Perform a rolling restart of all existing NDB Cluster data
   nodes. It is not necessary (or usually even desirable) to
   use [`--initial`](mysql-cluster-programs-ndbd.md#option_ndbd_initial) when restarting
   the existing data nodes.

   If you are using API nodes with dynamically allocated IDs
   matching any node IDs that you wish to assign to new data
   nodes, you must restart all API nodes (including SQL nodes)
   before restarting any of the data nodes processes in this
   step. This causes any API nodes with node IDs that were
   previously not explicitly assigned to relinquish those node
   IDs and acquire new ones.
4. Perform a rolling restart of any SQL or API nodes connected
   to the NDB Cluster.
5. Start the new data nodes.

   The new data nodes may be started in any order. They can
   also be started concurrently, as long as they are started
   after the rolling restarts of all existing data nodes have
   been completed, and before proceeding to the next step.
6. Execute one or more [`CREATE
   NODEGROUP`](mysql-cluster-mgm-client-commands.md#ndbclient-create-nodegroup) commands in the NDB Cluster management
   client to create the new node group or node groups to which
   the new data nodes belong.
7. Redistribute the cluster's data among all data nodes,
   including the new ones. Normally this is done by issuing an
   [`ALTER TABLE ...
   ALGORITHM=INPLACE, REORGANIZE PARTITION`](alter-table.md "15.1.9 ALTER TABLE Statement") statement
   in the [**mysql**](mysql.md "6.5.1 mysql — The MySQL Command-Line Client") client for each
   [`NDBCLUSTER`](mysql-cluster.md "Chapter 25 MySQL NDB Cluster 8.0") table.

   *Exception*: For tables created using the
   `MAX_ROWS` option, this statement does not
   work; instead, use `ALTER TABLE ...
   ALGORITHM=INPLACE MAX_ROWS=...` to reorganize such
   tables. You should also bear in mind that using
   `MAX_ROWS` to set the number of partitions
   in this fashion is deprecated, and you should use
   `PARTITION_BALANCE` instead; see
   [Section 15.1.20.12, “Setting NDB Comment Options”](create-table-ndb-comment-options.md "15.1.20.12 Setting NDB Comment Options"), for more
   information.

   Note

   This needs to be done only for tables already existing at
   the time the new node group is added. Data in tables
   created after the new node group is added is distributed
   automatically; however, data added to any given table
   `tbl` that existed before the new nodes
   were added is not distributed using the new nodes until
   that table has been reorganized.
8. `ALTER TABLE ... REORGANIZE PARTITION
   ALGORITHM=INPLACE` reorganizes partitions but does
   not reclaim the space freed on the “old” nodes.
   You can do this by issuing, for each
   [`NDBCLUSTER`](mysql-cluster.md "Chapter 25 MySQL NDB Cluster 8.0") table, an
   [`OPTIMIZE TABLE`](optimize-table.md "15.7.3.4 OPTIMIZE TABLE Statement") statement in
   the [**mysql**](mysql.md "6.5.1 mysql — The MySQL Command-Line Client") client.

   This works for space used by variable-width columns of
   in-memory `NDB` tables. `OPTIMIZE
   TABLE` is not supported for fixed-width columns of
   in-memory tables; it is also not supported for Disk Data
   tables.

You can add all the nodes desired, then issue several
[`CREATE NODEGROUP`](mysql-cluster-mgm-client-commands.md#ndbclient-create-nodegroup) commands in
succession to add the new node groups to the cluster.
