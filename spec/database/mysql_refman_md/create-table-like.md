#### 15.1.20.3 CREATE TABLE ... LIKE Statement

Use `CREATE TABLE ... LIKE` to create an empty
table based on the definition of another table, including any
column attributes and indexes defined in the original table:

```sql
CREATE TABLE new_tbl LIKE orig_tbl;
```

The copy is created using the same version of the table storage
format as the original table. The
[`SELECT`](privileges-provided.md#priv_select) privilege is required on
the original table.

`LIKE` works only for base tables, not for
views.

Important

You cannot execute `CREATE TABLE` or
`CREATE TABLE ... LIKE` while a
[`LOCK TABLES`](lock-tables.md "15.3.6 LOCK TABLES and UNLOCK TABLES Statements") statement is in
effect.

[`CREATE TABLE ...
LIKE`](create-table.md "15.1.20 CREATE TABLE Statement") makes the same checks as
[`CREATE TABLE`](create-table.md "15.1.20 CREATE TABLE Statement"). This means that
if the current SQL mode is different from the mode in effect
when the original table was created, the table definition
might be considered invalid for the new mode and cause the
statement to fail.

For `CREATE TABLE ... LIKE`, the destination
table preserves generated column information from the original
table.

For `CREATE TABLE ... LIKE`, the destination
table preserves expression default values from the original
table.

For `CREATE TABLE ... LIKE`, the destination
table preserves `CHECK` constraints from the
original table, except that all the constraint names are
generated.

`CREATE TABLE ... LIKE` does not preserve any
`DATA DIRECTORY` or `INDEX
DIRECTORY` table options that were specified for the
original table, or any foreign key definitions.

If the original table is a `TEMPORARY` table,
`CREATE TABLE ... LIKE` does not preserve
`TEMPORARY`. To create a
`TEMPORARY` destination table, use
`CREATE TEMPORARY TABLE ... LIKE`.

Tables created in the `mysql` tablespace, the
`InnoDB` system tablespace
(`innodb_system`), or general tablespaces
include a `TABLESPACE` attribute in the table
definition, which defines the tablespace where the table
resides. Due to a temporary regression, `CREATE TABLE
... LIKE` preserves the `TABLESPACE`
attribute and creates the table in the defined tablespace
regardless of the
[`innodb_file_per_table`](innodb-parameters.md#sysvar_innodb_file_per_table) setting.
To avoid the `TABLESPACE` attribute when
creating an empty table based on the definition of such a table,
use this syntax instead:

```sql
CREATE TABLE new_tbl SELECT * FROM orig_tbl LIMIT 0;
```

[`CREATE TABLE
... LIKE`](create-table-like.md "15.1.20.3 CREATE TABLE ... LIKE Statement") operations apply all
`ENGINE_ATTRIBUTE` and
`SECONDARY_ENGINE_ATTRIBUTE` values to the new
table.
