#### 15.3.8.3 Restrictions on XA Transactions

XA transaction support is limited to the
`InnoDB` storage engine.

For “external XA,” a MySQL server acts as a
Resource Manager and client programs act as Transaction
Managers. For “Internal XA”, storage engines within
a MySQL server act as RMs, and the server itself acts as a TM.
Internal XA support is limited by the capabilities of individual
storage engines. Internal XA is required for handling XA
transactions that involve more than one storage engine. The
implementation of internal XA requires that a storage engine
support two-phase commit at the table handler level, and
currently this is true only for `InnoDB`.

For [`XA
START`](xa-statements.md "15.3.8.1 XA Transaction SQL Statements"), the `JOIN` and
`RESUME` clauses are recognized but have no
effect.

For [`XA
END`](xa-statements.md "15.3.8.1 XA Transaction SQL Statements") the `SUSPEND [FOR MIGRATE]`
clause is recognized but has no effect.

The requirement that the *`bqual`* part
of the *`xid`* value be different for
each XA transaction within a global transaction is a limitation
of the current MySQL XA implementation. It is not part of the XA
specification.

An XA transaction is written to the binary log in two parts.
When `XA PREPARE` is issued, the first part of
the transaction up to `XA PREPARE` is written
using an initial GTID. A `XA_prepare_log_event`
is used to identify such transactions in the binary log. When
`XA COMMIT` or `XA ROLLBACK`
is issued, a second part of the transaction containing only the
`XA COMMIT` or `XA ROLLBACK`
statement is written using a second GTID. Note that the initial
part of the transaction, identified by
`XA_prepare_log_event`, is not necessarily
followed by its `XA COMMIT` or `XA
ROLLBACK`, which can cause interleaved binary logging
of any two XA transactions. The two parts of the XA transaction
can even appear in different binary log files. This means that
an XA transaction in `PREPARED` state is now
persistent until an explicit `XA COMMIT` or
`XA ROLLBACK` statement is issued, ensuring
that XA transactions are compatible with replication.

On a replica, immediately after the XA transaction is prepared,
it is detached from the replication applier thread, and can be
committed or rolled back by any thread on the replica. This
means that the same XA transaction can appear in the
[`events_transactions_current`](performance-schema-events-transactions-current-table.md "29.12.7.1 The events_transactions_current Table") table
with different states on different threads. The
[`events_transactions_current`](performance-schema-events-transactions-current-table.md "29.12.7.1 The events_transactions_current Table") table
displays the current status of the most recent monitored
transaction event on the thread, and does not update this status
when the thread is idle. So the XA transaction can still be
displayed in the `PREPARED` state for the
original applier thread, after it has been processed by another
thread. To positively identify XA transactions that are still in
the `PREPARED` state and need to be recovered,
use the [`XA
RECOVER`](xa-statements.md "15.3.8.1 XA Transaction SQL Statements") statement rather than the Performance Schema
transaction tables.

The following restrictions exist for using XA transactions:

- Prior to MySQL 8.0.30, XA transactions are not fully
  resilient to an unexpected halt with respect to the binary
  log. If there is an unexpected halt while the server is in
  the middle of executing an `XA PREPARE`,
  `XA COMMIT`, `XA
  ROLLBACK`, or `XA COMMIT ... ONE
  PHASE` statement, the server might not be able to
  recover to a correct state, leaving the server and the
  binary log in an inconsistent state. In this situation, the
  binary log might either contain extra XA transactions that
  are not applied, or miss XA transactions that are applied.
  Also, if GTIDs are enabled, after recovery
  `@@GLOBAL.GTID_EXECUTED` might not
  correctly describe the transactions that have been applied.
  Note that if an unexpected halt occurs before `XA
  PREPARE`, between `XA PREPARE` and
  `XA COMMIT` (or `XA
  ROLLBACK`), or after `XA COMMIT`
  (or `XA ROLLBACK`), the server and binary
  log are correctly recovered and taken to a consistent state.

  Beginning with MySQL 8.0.30, this is no longer an issue; the
  server implements `XA PREPARE` as a
  two-phase operation, which maintains the state of the
  prepare operation between the storage engine and the server,
  and imposes order of execution between the storage engine
  and the binary log, so that state is not broadcast before it
  is consistent and persistent on the server node.

  You should be aware that, when the same transaction XID is
  used to execute XA transactions sequentially and a break
  occurs during the processing of
  [`XA COMMIT ...
  ONE PHASE`](xa-statements.md "15.3.8.1 XA Transaction SQL Statements"), it may no longer be possible to
  synchronize the state between the binary log and the storage
  engine. This can occur if the series of events just
  described takes place after this transaction has been
  prepared in the storage engine, while the `XA
  COMMIT` statement is still executing. This is a
  known issue.
- The use of replication filters or binary log filters in
  combination with XA transactions is not supported. Filtering
  of tables could cause an XA transaction to be empty on a
  replica, and empty XA transactions are not supported. Also,
  with the replica's connection metadata repository and
  applier metadata repository stored in
  [`InnoDB`](innodb-storage-engine.md "Chapter 17 The InnoDB Storage Engine") tables, which became the
  default in MySQL 8.0, the internal state of the data engine
  transaction is changed following a filtered XA transaction,
  and can become inconsistent with the replication transaction
  context state.

  The error
  [`ER_XA_REPLICATION_FILTERS`](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/mysql-errors/8.0/en/server-error-reference.html#error_er_xa_replication_filters) is
  logged whenever an XA transaction is impacted by a
  replication filter, whether or not the transaction was empty
  as a result. If the transaction is not empty, the replica is
  able to continue running, but you should take steps to
  discontinue the use of replication filters with XA
  transactions in order to avoid potential issues. If the
  transaction is empty, the replica stops. In that event, the
  replica might be in an undetermined state in which the
  consistency of the replication process might be compromised.
  In particular, the `gtid_executed` set on a
  replica of the replica might be inconsistent with that on
  the source. To resolve this situation, isolate the source
  and stop all replication, then check GTID consistency across
  the replication topology. Undo the XA transaction that
  generated the error message, then restart replication.
- XA transactions are considered unsafe for statement-based
  replication. If two XA transactions committed in parallel on
  the source are being prepared on the replica in the inverse
  order, locking dependencies can occur that cannot be safely
  resolved, and it is possible for replication to fail with
  deadlock on the replica. This situation can occur for a
  single-threaded or multithreaded replica. When
  [`binlog_format=STATEMENT`](replication-options-binary-log.md#sysvar_binlog_format) is
  set, a warning is issued for DML statements inside XA
  transactions. When
  [`binlog_format=MIXED`](replication-options-binary-log.md#sysvar_binlog_format) or
  [`binlog_format=ROW`](replication-options-binary-log.md#sysvar_binlog_format) is set,
  DML statements inside XA transactions are logged using
  row-based replication, and the potential issue is not
  present.
