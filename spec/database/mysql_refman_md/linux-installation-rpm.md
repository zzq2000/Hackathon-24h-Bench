### 2.5.4 Installing MySQL on Linux Using RPM Packages from Oracle

The recommended way to install MySQL on RPM-based Linux
distributions is by using the RPM packages provided by Oracle.
There are two sources for obtaining them, for the Community
Edition of MySQL:

- From the MySQL software repositories:

  - The MySQL Yum repository (see
    [Section 2.5.1, “Installing MySQL on Linux Using the MySQL Yum Repository”](linux-installation-yum-repo.md "2.5.1 Installing MySQL on Linux Using the MySQL Yum Repository") for
    details).
  - The MySQL SLES repository (see
    [Section 2.5.3, “Installing MySQL on Linux Using the MySQL SLES Repository”](linux-installation-sles-repo.md "2.5.3 Installing MySQL on Linux Using the MySQL SLES Repository") for
    details).
- From the  [Download
  MySQL Community Server](https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/mysql/) page in the
  [MySQL Developer Zone](https://dev.mysql.com/).

Note

RPM distributions of MySQL are also provided by other vendors.
Be aware that they may differ from those built by Oracle in
features, capabilities, and conventions (including communication
setup), and that the installation instructions in this manual do
not necessarily apply to them. The vendor's instructions should
be consulted instead.

The full names for the RPMs have the following syntax:

```terminal
packagename-version-distribution-arch.rpm
```

The *`distribution`* and
*`arch`* values indicate the Linux
distribution and the processor type for which the package was
built. See the table below for lists of the distribution
identifiers:

**Table 2.11 MySQL Linux RPM Package Distribution Identifiers**

| Distribution Value | Intended Use |
| --- | --- |
| el*`{version}`* where *`{version}`* is the major Enterprise Linux version, such as `el8` | EL6 (8.0), EL7, EL8, EL9, and EL10-based platforms (for example, the corresponding versions of Oracle Linux, Red Hat Enterprise Linux, and CentOS) |
| fc*`{version}`* where *`{version}`* is the major Fedora version, such as `fc37` | Fedora 41 and 42 |
| `sles12` | SUSE Linux Enterprise Server 12 |

To see all files in an RPM package (for example,
`mysql-community-server`), use the following
command:

```terminal
$> rpm -qpl mysql-community-server-version-distribution-arch.rpm
```

*The discussion in the rest of this section applies only
to an installation process using the RPM packages directly
downloaded from Oracle, instead of through a MySQL
repository.*

Dependency relationships exist among some of the packages. If you
plan to install many of the packages, you may wish to download the
RPM bundle **tar** file instead, which contains all
the RPM packages listed above, so that you need not download them
separately.

In most cases, you need to install the
`mysql-community-server`,
`mysql-community-client`,
`mysql-community-client-plugins`,
`mysql-community-libs`,
`mysql-community-icu-data-files`,
`mysql-community-common`, and
`mysql-community-libs-compat` packages to get a
functional, standard MySQL installation. To perform such a
standard, basic installation, go to the folder that contains all
those packages (and, preferably, no other RPM packages with
similar names), and issue the following command:

```terminal
$> sudo yum install mysql-community-{server,client,client-plugins,icu-data-files,common,libs}-*
```

Replace **yum** with **zypper** for
SLES, and with **dnf** for Fedora.

While it is much preferable to use a high-level package management
tool like **yum** to install the packages, users
who prefer direct **rpm** commands can replace the
**yum install** command with the **rpm
-Uvh** command; however, using **rpm -Uvh**
instead makes the installation process more prone to failure, due
to potential dependency issues the installation process might run
into.

To install only the client programs, you can skip
`mysql-community-server` in your list of packages
to install; issue the following command:

```terminal
$> sudo yum install mysql-community-{client,client-plugins,common,libs}-*
```

Replace **yum** with **zypper** for
SLES, and with **dnf** for Fedora.

A standard installation of MySQL using the RPM packages result in
files and resources created under the system directories, shown in
the following table.

**Table 2.12 MySQL Installation Layout for Linux RPM Packages from the MySQL Developer Zone**

| Files or Resources | Location |
| --- | --- |
| Client programs and scripts | `/usr/bin` |
| [**mysqld**](mysqld.md "6.3.1 mysqld — The MySQL Server") server | `/usr/sbin` |
| Configuration file | `/etc/my.cnf` |
| Data directory | `/var/lib/mysql` |
| Error log file | For RHEL, Oracle Linux, CentOS or Fedora platforms: `/var/log/mysqld.log`  For SLES: `/var/log/mysql/mysqld.log` |
| Value of [`secure_file_priv`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_secure_file_priv) | `/var/lib/mysql-files` |
| System V init script | For RHEL, Oracle Linux, CentOS or Fedora platforms: `/etc/init.d/mysqld`  For SLES: `/etc/init.d/mysql` |
| Systemd service | For RHEL, Oracle Linux, CentOS or Fedora platforms: `mysqld`  For SLES: `mysql` |
| Pid file | `/var/run/mysql/mysqld.pid` |
| Socket | `/var/lib/mysql/mysql.sock` |
| Keyring directory | `/var/lib/mysql-keyring` |
| Unix manual pages | `/usr/share/man` |
| Include (header) files | `/usr/include/mysql` |
| Libraries | `/usr/lib/mysql` |
| Miscellaneous support files (for example, error messages, and character set files) | `/usr/share/mysql` |

The installation also creates a user named
`mysql` and a group named
`mysql` on the system.

Notes

- The `mysql` user is created using the
  `-r` and `-s /bin/false`
  options of the `useradd` command, so that
  it does not have login permissions to your server host (see
  [Creating
  the mysql User and Group](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/mysql-secure-deployment-guide/8.0/en/secure-deployment-install.html#secure-deployment-mysql-user) for details). To switch to
  the `mysql` user on your OS, use the
  `--shell=/bin/bash` option for the
  `su` command:

  ```simple
  su - mysql --shell=/bin/bash
  ```
- Installation of previous versions of MySQL using older
  packages might have created a configuration file named
  `/usr/my.cnf`. It is highly recommended
  that you examine the contents of the file and migrate the
  desired settings inside to the file
  `/etc/my.cnf` file, then remove
  `/usr/my.cnf`.

MySQL is NOT automatically started at the end of the installation
process. For Red Hat Enterprise Linux, Oracle Linux, CentOS, and
Fedora systems, use the following command to start MySQL:

```terminal
$> systemctl start mysqld
```

For SLES systems, the command is the same, but the service name is
different:

```terminal
$> systemctl start mysql
```

If the operating system is systemd enabled, standard
**systemctl** (or alternatively,
**service** with the arguments reversed) commands
such as **stop**, **start**,
**status**, and [**restart**](restart.md "15.7.8.8 RESTART Statement") should
be used to manage the MySQL server service. The
`mysqld` service is enabled by default, and it
starts at system reboot. Notice that certain things might work
differently on systemd platforms: for example, changing the
location of the data directory might cause issues. See
[Section 2.5.9, “Managing MySQL Server with systemd”](using-systemd.md "2.5.9 Managing MySQL Server with systemd") for additional information.

During an upgrade installation using RPM and DEB packages, if the
MySQL server is running when the upgrade occurs then the MySQL
server is stopped, the upgrade occurs, and the MySQL server is
restarted. One exception: if the edition also changes during an
upgrade (such as community to commercial, or vice-versa), then
MySQL server is not restarted.

At the initial start up of the server, the following happens,
given that the data directory of the server is empty:

- The server is initialized.
- An SSL certificate and key files are generated in the data
  directory.
- [`validate_password`](validate-password.md "8.4.3 The Password Validation Component")
  is installed and enabled.
- A superuser account `'root'@'localhost'` is
  created. A password for the superuser is set and stored in the
  error log file. To reveal it, use the following command for
  RHEL, Oracle Linux, CentOS, and Fedora systems:

  ```terminal
  $> sudo grep 'temporary password' /var/log/mysqld.log
  ```

  Use the following command for SLES systems:

  ```terminal
  $> sudo grep 'temporary password' /var/log/mysql/mysqld.log
  ```

  The next step is to log in with the generated, temporary
  password and set a custom password for the superuser account:

```terminal
$> mysql -uroot -p
```

```sql
mysql> ALTER USER 'root'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'MyNewPass4!';
```

Note

[`validate_password`](validate-password.md "8.4.3 The Password Validation Component")
is installed by default. The default password policy implemented
by `validate_password` requires that passwords
contain at least one uppercase letter, one lowercase letter, one
digit, and one special character, and that the total password
length is at least 8 characters.

If something goes wrong during installation, you might find debug
information in the error log file
`/var/log/mysqld.log`.

For some Linux distributions, it might be necessary to increase
the limit on number of file descriptors available to
[**mysqld**](mysqld.md "6.3.1 mysqld — The MySQL Server"). See
[Section B.3.2.16, “File Not Found and Similar Errors”](not-enough-file-handles.md "B.3.2.16 File Not Found and Similar Errors")

**Installing Client Libraries from Multiple MySQL Versions.**
It is possible to install multiple client library versions, such
as for the case that you want to maintain compatibility with
older applications linked against previous libraries. To install
an older client library, use the `--oldpackage`
option with **rpm**. For example, to install
`mysql-community-libs-5.5` on an EL6 system
that has `libmysqlclient.21` from MySQL 8.0,
use a command like this:

```terminal
$> rpm --oldpackage -ivh mysql-community-libs-5.5.50-2.el6.x86_64.rpm
```

**Debug Package.**
A special variant of MySQL Server compiled with the
[debug package](dbug-package.md "7.9.4 The DBUG Package") has been
included in the server RPM packages. It performs debugging and
memory allocation checks and produces a trace file when the
server is running. To use that debug version, start MySQL with
`/usr/sbin/mysqld-debug`, instead of starting
it as a service or with `/usr/sbin/mysqld`.
See [Section 7.9.4, “The DBUG Package”](dbug-package.md "7.9.4 The DBUG Package") for the debug options you can
use.

Note

The default plugin directory for debug builds changed from
`/usr/lib64/mysql/plugin` to
`/usr/lib64/mysql/plugin/debug` in MySQL
8.0.4. Previously, it was necessary to change
[`plugin_dir`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_plugin_dir) to
`/usr/lib64/mysql/plugin/debug` for debug
builds.

**Rebuilding RPMs from source SRPMs.**
Source code SRPM packages for MySQL are available for download.
They can be used as-is to rebuild the MySQL RPMs with the
standard **rpmbuild** tool chain.
