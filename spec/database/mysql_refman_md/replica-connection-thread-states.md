### 10.14.7 Replication Connection Thread States

These thread states occur on a replica server but are associated
with connection threads, not with the I/O or SQL threads.

In MySQL 8.0.26, incompatible changes were made to
instrumentation names, including the names of thread stages,
containing the terms “master”, which is changed to
“source”, “slave”, which is changed to
“replica”, and “mts” (for
“multithreaded slave”), which is changed to
“mta” (for “multithreaded applier”).
Monitoring tools that work with these instrumentation names
might be impacted. If the incompatible changes have an impact
for you, set the
[`terminology_use_previous`](replication-options-replica.md#sysvar_terminology_use_previous) system
variable to `BEFORE_8_0_26` to make MySQL
Server use the old versions of the names for the objects
specified in the previous list. This enables monitoring tools
that rely on the old names to continue working until they can be
updated to use the new names.

Set the
[`terminology_use_previous`](replication-options-replica.md#sysvar_terminology_use_previous) system
variable with session scope to support individual functions, or
global scope to be a default for all new sessions. When global
scope is used, the slow query log contains the old versions of
the names.

- `Changing master`

  From MySQL 8.0.26: `Changing replication
  source`

  The thread is processing a [`CHANGE
  REPLICATION SOURCE TO`](change-replication-source-to.md "15.4.2.3 CHANGE REPLICATION SOURCE TO Statement") statement (from MySQL
  8.0.23) or [`CHANGE MASTER TO`](change-master-to.md "15.4.2.1 CHANGE MASTER TO Statement")
  statement (before MySQL 8.0.23).
- `Killing slave`

  The thread is processing a
  `STOP REPLICA`
  statement.
- `Opening master dump table`

  This state occurs after `Creating table from master
  dump`.
- `Reading master dump table data`

  This state occurs after `Opening master dump
  table`.
- `Rebuilding the index on master dump table`

  This state occurs after `Reading master dump table
  data`.
