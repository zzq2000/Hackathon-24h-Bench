#### 15.6.7.2 DECLARE ... HANDLER Statement

```sql
DECLARE handler_action HANDLER
    FOR condition_value [, condition_value] ...
    statement

handler_action: {
    CONTINUE
  | EXIT
  | UNDO
}

condition_value: {
    mysql_error_code
  | SQLSTATE [VALUE] sqlstate_value
  | condition_name
  | SQLWARNING
  | NOT FOUND
  | SQLEXCEPTION
}
```

The [`DECLARE ...
HANDLER`](declare-handler.md "15.6.7.2 DECLARE ... HANDLER Statement") statement specifies a handler that deals with
one or more conditions. If one of these conditions occurs, the
specified *`statement`* executes.
*`statement`* can be a simple statement
such as `SET var_name =
value`, or a compound
statement written using `BEGIN` and
`END` (see [Section 15.6.1, “BEGIN ... END Compound Statement”](begin-end.md "15.6.1 BEGIN ... END Compound Statement")).

Handler declarations must appear after variable or condition
declarations.

The *`handler_action`* value indicates
what action the handler takes after execution of the handler
statement:

- `CONTINUE`: Execution of the current
  program continues.
- `EXIT`: Execution terminates for the
  [`BEGIN ...
  END`](begin-end.md "15.6.1 BEGIN ... END Compound Statement") compound statement in which the handler is
  declared. This is true even if the condition occurs in an
  inner block.
- `UNDO`: Not supported.

The *`condition_value`* for
[`DECLARE ...
HANDLER`](declare-handler.md "15.6.7.2 DECLARE ... HANDLER Statement") indicates the specific condition or class of
conditions that activates the handler. It can take the following
forms:

- *`mysql_error_code`*: An integer
  literal indicating a MySQL error code, such as 1051 to
  specify “unknown table”:

  ```sql
  DECLARE CONTINUE HANDLER FOR 1051
    BEGIN
      -- body of handler
    END;
  ```

  Do not use MySQL error code 0 because that indicates success
  rather than an error condition. For a list of MySQL error
  codes, see [Server Error Message Reference](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/mysql-errors/8.0/en/server-error-reference.html).
- SQLSTATE [VALUE] *`sqlstate_value`*:
  A 5-character string literal indicating an SQLSTATE value,
  such as `'42S01'` to specify “unknown
  table”:

  ```sql
  DECLARE CONTINUE HANDLER FOR SQLSTATE '42S02'
    BEGIN
      -- body of handler
    END;
  ```

  Do not use SQLSTATE values that begin with
  `'00'` because those indicate success
  rather than an error condition. For a list of SQLSTATE
  values, see [Server Error Message Reference](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/mysql-errors/8.0/en/server-error-reference.html).
- *`condition_name`*: A condition name
  previously specified with
  [`DECLARE
  ... CONDITION`](declare-condition.md "15.6.7.1 DECLARE ... CONDITION Statement"). A condition name can be associated
  with a MySQL error code or SQLSTATE value. See
  [Section 15.6.7.1, “DECLARE ... CONDITION Statement”](declare-condition.md "15.6.7.1 DECLARE ... CONDITION Statement").
- `SQLWARNING`: Shorthand for the class of
  SQLSTATE values that begin with `'01'`.

  ```sql
  DECLARE CONTINUE HANDLER FOR SQLWARNING
    BEGIN
      -- body of handler
    END;
  ```
- `NOT FOUND`: Shorthand for the class of
  SQLSTATE values that begin with `'02'`.
  This is relevant within the context of cursors and is used
  to control what happens when a cursor reaches the end of a
  data set. If no more rows are available, a No Data condition
  occurs with SQLSTATE value `'02000'`. To
  detect this condition, you can set up a handler for it or
  for a `NOT FOUND` condition.

  ```sql
  DECLARE CONTINUE HANDLER FOR NOT FOUND
    BEGIN
      -- body of handler
    END;
  ```

  For another example, see [Section 15.6.6, “Cursors”](cursors.md "15.6.6 Cursors"). The
  `NOT FOUND` condition also occurs for
  `SELECT ... INTO
  var_list` statements
  that retrieve no rows.
- `SQLEXCEPTION`: Shorthand for the class of
  SQLSTATE values that do not begin with
  `'00'`, `'01'`, or
  `'02'`.

  ```sql
  DECLARE CONTINUE HANDLER FOR SQLEXCEPTION
    BEGIN
      -- body of handler
    END;
  ```

For information about how the server chooses handlers when a
condition occurs, see [Section 15.6.7.6, “Scope Rules for Handlers”](handler-scope.md "15.6.7.6 Scope Rules for Handlers").

If a condition occurs for which no handler has been declared,
the action taken depends on the condition class:

- For `SQLEXCEPTION` conditions, the stored
  program terminates at the statement that raised the
  condition, as if there were an `EXIT`
  handler. If the program was called by another stored
  program, the calling program handles the condition using the
  handler selection rules applied to its own handlers.
- For `SQLWARNING` conditions, the program
  continues executing, as if there were a
  `CONTINUE` handler.
- For `NOT FOUND` conditions, if the
  condition was raised normally, the action is
  `CONTINUE`. If it was raised by
  [`SIGNAL`](signal.md "15.6.7.5 SIGNAL Statement") or
  [`RESIGNAL`](resignal.md "15.6.7.4 RESIGNAL Statement"), the action is
  `EXIT`.

The following example uses a handler for `SQLSTATE
'23000'`, which occurs for a duplicate-key error:

```sql
mysql> CREATE TABLE test.t (s1 INT, PRIMARY KEY (s1));
Query OK, 0 rows affected (0.00 sec)

mysql> delimiter //

mysql> CREATE PROCEDURE handlerdemo ()
       BEGIN
         DECLARE CONTINUE HANDLER FOR SQLSTATE '23000' SET @x2 = 1;
         SET @x = 1;
         INSERT INTO test.t VALUES (1);
         SET @x = 2;
         INSERT INTO test.t VALUES (1);
         SET @x = 3;
       END;
       //
Query OK, 0 rows affected (0.00 sec)

mysql> CALL handlerdemo()//
Query OK, 0 rows affected (0.00 sec)

mysql> SELECT @x//
    +------+
    | @x   |
    +------+
    | 3    |
    +------+
    1 row in set (0.00 sec)
```

Notice that `@x` is `3` after
the procedure executes, which shows that execution continued to
the end of the procedure after the error occurred. If the
[`DECLARE ...
HANDLER`](declare-handler.md "15.6.7.2 DECLARE ... HANDLER Statement") statement had not been present, MySQL would
have taken the default action (`EXIT`) after
the second [`INSERT`](insert.md "15.2.7 INSERT Statement") failed due to
the `PRIMARY KEY` constraint, and
`SELECT @x` would have returned
`2`.

To ignore a condition, declare a `CONTINUE`
handler for it and associate it with an empty block. For
example:

```sql
DECLARE CONTINUE HANDLER FOR SQLWARNING BEGIN END;
```

The scope of a block label does not include the code for
handlers declared within the block. Therefore, the statement
associated with a handler cannot use
[`ITERATE`](iterate.md "15.6.5.3 ITERATE Statement") or
[`LEAVE`](leave.md "15.6.5.4 LEAVE Statement") to refer to labels for
blocks that enclose the handler declaration. Consider the
following example, where the
[`REPEAT`](repeat.md "15.6.5.6 REPEAT Statement") block has a label of
`retry`:

```sql
CREATE PROCEDURE p ()
BEGIN
  DECLARE i INT DEFAULT 3;
  retry:
    REPEAT
      BEGIN
        DECLARE CONTINUE HANDLER FOR SQLWARNING
          BEGIN
            ITERATE retry;    # illegal
          END;
        IF i < 0 THEN
          LEAVE retry;        # legal
        END IF;
        SET i = i - 1;
      END;
    UNTIL FALSE END REPEAT;
END;
```

The `retry` label is in scope for the
[`IF`](if.md "15.6.5.2 IF Statement") statement within the block. It
is not in scope for the `CONTINUE` handler, so
the reference there is invalid and results in an error:

```none
ERROR 1308 (42000): LEAVE with no matching label: retry
```

To avoid references to outer labels in handlers, use one of
these strategies:

- To leave the block, use an `EXIT` handler.
  If no block cleanup is required, the
  [`BEGIN ...
  END`](begin-end.md "15.6.1 BEGIN ... END Compound Statement") handler body can be empty:

  ```sql
  DECLARE EXIT HANDLER FOR SQLWARNING BEGIN END;
  ```

  Otherwise, put the cleanup statements in the handler body:

  ```sql
  DECLARE EXIT HANDLER FOR SQLWARNING
    BEGIN
      block cleanup statements
    END;
  ```
- To continue execution, set a status variable in a
  `CONTINUE` handler that can be checked in
  the enclosing block to determine whether the handler was
  invoked. The following example uses the variable
  `done` for this purpose:

  ```sql
  CREATE PROCEDURE p ()
  BEGIN
    DECLARE i INT DEFAULT 3;
    DECLARE done INT DEFAULT FALSE;
    retry:
      REPEAT
        BEGIN
          DECLARE CONTINUE HANDLER FOR SQLWARNING
            BEGIN
              SET done = TRUE;
            END;
          IF done OR i < 0 THEN
            LEAVE retry;
          END IF;
          SET i = i - 1;
        END;
      UNTIL FALSE END REPEAT;
  END;
  ```
