### 7.6.1 Installing and Uninstalling Plugins

Server plugins must be loaded into the server before they can be
used. MySQL supports plugin loading at server startup and runtime.
It is also possible to control the activation state of loaded
plugins at startup, and to unload them at runtime.

While a plugin is loaded, information about it is available as
described in [Section 7.6.2, “Obtaining Server Plugin Information”](obtaining-plugin-information.md "7.6.2 Obtaining Server Plugin Information").

- [Plugins and Loadable Functions](plugin-loading.md#server-plugin-loadable-function-installing "Plugins and Loadable Functions")

#### Installing Plugins

Before a server plugin can be used, it must be installed using
one of the following methods. In the descriptions,
*`plugin_name`* stands for a plugin name
such as `innodb`, `csv`, or
`validate_password`.

- [Built-in Plugins](plugin-loading.md#server-plugin-installing-built-in "Built-in Plugins")
- [Plugins Registered in the mysql.plugin System Table](plugin-loading.md#server-plugin-installing-system-table "Plugins Registered in the mysql.plugin System Table")
- [Plugins Named with Command-Line Options](plugin-loading.md#server-plugin-installing-command-line "Plugins Named with Command-Line Options")
- [Plugins Installed with the INSTALL PLUGIN Statement](plugin-loading.md#server-plugin-installing-install-plugin "Plugins Installed with the INSTALL PLUGIN Statement")

##### Built-in Plugins

A built-in plugin is known by the server automatically. By
default, the server enables the plugin at startup. Some built-in
plugins permit this to be changed with the
`--plugin_name[=activation_state]`
option.

##### Plugins Registered in the mysql.plugin System Table

The `mysql.plugin` system table serves as a
registry of plugins (other than built-in plugins, which need not
be registered). During the normal startup sequence, the server
loads plugins registered in the table. By default, for a plugin
loaded from the `mysql.plugin` table, the
server also enables the plugin. This can be changed with the
`--plugin_name[=activation_state]`
option.

If the server is started with the
[`--skip-grant-tables`](server-options.md#option_mysqld_skip-grant-tables) option,
plugins registered in the `mysql.plugin` table
are not loaded and are unavailable.

##### Plugins Named with Command-Line Options

A plugin located in a plugin library file can be loaded at
server startup with the
[`--plugin-load`](server-options.md#option_mysqld_plugin-load),
[`--plugin-load-add`](server-options.md#option_mysqld_plugin-load-add), or
[`--early-plugin-load`](server-options.md#option_mysqld_early-plugin-load) option.
Normally, for a plugin loaded at startup, the server also
enables the plugin. This can be changed with the
`--plugin_name[=activation_state]`
option.

The [`--plugin-load`](server-options.md#option_mysqld_plugin-load) and
[`--plugin-load-add`](server-options.md#option_mysqld_plugin-load-add) options load
plugins after built-in plugins and storage engines have
initialized during the server startup sequence. The
[`--early-plugin-load`](server-options.md#option_mysqld_early-plugin-load) option is
used to load plugins that must be available prior to
initialization of built-in plugins and storage engines.

The value of each plugin-loading option is a semicolon-separated
list of *`plugin_library`* and
*`name`*`=`*`plugin_library`*
values. Each *`plugin_library`* is the
name of a library file that contains plugin code, and each
*`name`* is the name of a plugin to load.
If a plugin library is named without any preceding plugin name,
the server loads all plugins in the library. With a preceding
plugin name, the server loads only the named plugin from the
library. The server looks for plugin library files in the
directory named by the
[`plugin_dir`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_plugin_dir) system variable.

Plugin-loading options do not register any plugin in the
`mysql.plugin` table. For subsequent restarts,
the server loads the plugin again only if
[`--plugin-load`](server-options.md#option_mysqld_plugin-load),
[`--plugin-load-add`](server-options.md#option_mysqld_plugin-load-add), or
[`--early-plugin-load`](server-options.md#option_mysqld_early-plugin-load) is given
again. That is, the option produces a one-time
plugin-installation operation that persists for a single server
invocation.

[`--plugin-load`](server-options.md#option_mysqld_plugin-load),
[`--plugin-load-add`](server-options.md#option_mysqld_plugin-load-add), and
[`--early-plugin-load`](server-options.md#option_mysqld_early-plugin-load) enable
plugins to be loaded even when
[`--skip-grant-tables`](server-options.md#option_mysqld_skip-grant-tables) is given
(which causes the server to ignore the
`mysql.plugin` table).
[`--plugin-load`](server-options.md#option_mysqld_plugin-load),
[`--plugin-load-add`](server-options.md#option_mysqld_plugin-load-add), and
[`--early-plugin-load`](server-options.md#option_mysqld_early-plugin-load) also enable
plugins to be loaded at startup that cannot be loaded at
runtime.

The [`--plugin-load-add`](server-options.md#option_mysqld_plugin-load-add) option
complements the [`--plugin-load`](server-options.md#option_mysqld_plugin-load)
option:

- Each instance of
  [`--plugin-load`](server-options.md#option_mysqld_plugin-load) resets the set
  of plugins to load at startup, whereas
  [`--plugin-load-add`](server-options.md#option_mysqld_plugin-load-add) adds a
  plugin or plugins to the set of plugins to be loaded without
  resetting the current set. Consequently, if multiple
  instances of [`--plugin-load`](server-options.md#option_mysqld_plugin-load)
  are specified, only the last one applies. With multiple
  instances of
  [`--plugin-load-add`](server-options.md#option_mysqld_plugin-load-add), all of
  them apply.
- The argument format is the same as for
  [`--plugin-load`](server-options.md#option_mysqld_plugin-load), but multiple
  instances of
  [`--plugin-load-add`](server-options.md#option_mysqld_plugin-load-add) can be used
  to avoid specifying a large set of plugins as a single long
  unwieldy [`--plugin-load`](server-options.md#option_mysqld_plugin-load)
  argument.
- [`--plugin-load-add`](server-options.md#option_mysqld_plugin-load-add) can be
  given in the absence of
  [`--plugin-load`](server-options.md#option_mysqld_plugin-load), but any
  instance of [`--plugin-load-add`](server-options.md#option_mysqld_plugin-load-add)
  that appears before
  [`--plugin-load`](server-options.md#option_mysqld_plugin-load) has no effect
  because [`--plugin-load`](server-options.md#option_mysqld_plugin-load) resets
  the set of plugins to load.

For example, these options:

```terminal
--plugin-load=x --plugin-load-add=y
```

are equivalent to these options:

```terminal
--plugin-load-add=x --plugin-load-add=y
```

and are also equivalent to this option:

```terminal
--plugin-load="x;y"
```

But these options:

```terminal
--plugin-load-add=y --plugin-load=x
```

are equivalent to this option:

```terminal
--plugin-load=x
```

##### Plugins Installed with the INSTALL PLUGIN Statement

A plugin located in a plugin library file can be loaded at
runtime with the [`INSTALL PLUGIN`](install-plugin.md "15.7.4.4 INSTALL PLUGIN Statement")
statement. The statement also registers the plugin in the
`mysql.plugin` table to cause the server to
load it on subsequent restarts. For this reason,
[`INSTALL PLUGIN`](install-plugin.md "15.7.4.4 INSTALL PLUGIN Statement") requires the
[`INSERT`](privileges-provided.md#priv_insert) privilege for the
`mysql.plugin` table.

The plugin library file base name depends on your platform.
Common suffixes are `.so` for Unix and
Unix-like systems, `.dll` for Windows.

Example: The [`--plugin-load-add`](server-options.md#option_mysqld_plugin-load-add)
option installs a plugin at server startup. To install a plugin
named `myplugin` from a plugin library file
named `somepluglib.so`, use these lines in a
`my.cnf` file:

```ini
[mysqld]
plugin-load-add=myplugin=somepluglib.so
```

In this case, the plugin is not registered in
`mysql.plugin`. Restarting the server without
the [`--plugin-load-add`](server-options.md#option_mysqld_plugin-load-add) option
causes the plugin not to be loaded at startup.

Alternatively, the [`INSTALL PLUGIN`](install-plugin.md "15.7.4.4 INSTALL PLUGIN Statement")
statement causes the server to load the plugin code from the
library file at runtime:

```sql
INSTALL PLUGIN myplugin SONAME 'somepluglib.so';
```

[`INSTALL PLUGIN`](install-plugin.md "15.7.4.4 INSTALL PLUGIN Statement") also causes
“permanent” plugin registration: The plugin is
listed in the `mysql.plugin` table to ensure
that the server loads it on subsequent restarts.

Many plugins can be loaded either at server startup or at
runtime. However, if a plugin is designed such that it must be
loaded and initialized during server startup, attempts to load
it at runtime using [`INSTALL
PLUGIN`](install-plugin.md "15.7.4.4 INSTALL PLUGIN Statement") produce an error:

```sql
mysql> INSTALL PLUGIN myplugin SONAME 'somepluglib.so';
ERROR 1721 (HY000): Plugin 'myplugin' is marked as not dynamically
installable. You have to stop the server to install it.
```

In this case, you must use
[`--plugin-load`](server-options.md#option_mysqld_plugin-load),
[`--plugin-load-add`](server-options.md#option_mysqld_plugin-load-add), or
[`--early-plugin-load`](server-options.md#option_mysqld_early-plugin-load).

If a plugin is named both using a
[`--plugin-load`](server-options.md#option_mysqld_plugin-load),
[`--plugin-load-add`](server-options.md#option_mysqld_plugin-load-add), or
[`--early-plugin-load`](server-options.md#option_mysqld_early-plugin-load) option and
(as a result of an earlier [`INSTALL
PLUGIN`](install-plugin.md "15.7.4.4 INSTALL PLUGIN Statement") statement) in the
`mysql.plugin` table, the server starts but
writes these messages to the error log:

```none
[ERROR] Function 'plugin_name' already exists
[Warning] Couldn't load plugin named 'plugin_name'
with soname 'plugin_object_file'.
```

#### Controlling Plugin Activation State

If the server knows about a plugin when it starts (for example,
because the plugin is named using a
[`--plugin-load-add`](server-options.md#option_mysqld_plugin-load-add) option or is
registered in the `mysql.plugin` table), the
server loads and enables the plugin by default. It is possible
to control activation state for such a plugin using a
`--plugin_name[=activation_state]`
startup option, where *`plugin_name`* is
the name of the plugin to affect, such as
`innodb`, `csv`, or
`validate_password`. As with other options,
dashes and underscores are interchangeable in option names.
Also, activation state values are not case-sensitive. For
example, `--my_plugin=ON` and
`--my-plugin=on` are equivalent.

- `--plugin_name=OFF`

  Tells the server to disable the plugin. This may not be
  possible for certain built-in plugins, such as
  `mysql_native_password`.
- `--plugin_name[=ON]`

  Tells the server to enable the plugin. (Specifying the
  option as
  `--plugin_name`
  without a value has the same effect.) If the plugin fails to
  initialize, the server runs with the plugin disabled.
- `--plugin_name=FORCE`

  Tells the server to enable the plugin, but if plugin
  initialization fails, the server does not start. In other
  words, this option forces the server to run with the plugin
  enabled or not at all.
- `--plugin_name=FORCE_PLUS_PERMANENT`

  Like `FORCE`, but in addition prevents the
  plugin from being unloaded at runtime. If a user attempts to
  do so with [`UNINSTALL PLUGIN`](uninstall-plugin.md "15.7.4.6 UNINSTALL PLUGIN Statement"),
  an error occurs.

Plugin activation states are visible in the
`LOAD_OPTION` column of the Information Schema
[`PLUGINS`](information-schema-plugins-table.md "28.3.22 The INFORMATION_SCHEMA PLUGINS Table") table.

Suppose that `CSV`,
`BLACKHOLE`, and `ARCHIVE` are
built-in pluggable storage engines and that you want the server
to load them at startup, subject to these conditions: The server
is permitted to run if `CSV` initialization
fails, must require that `BLACKHOLE`
initialization succeeds, and should disable
`ARCHIVE`. To accomplish that, use these lines
in an option file:

```ini
[mysqld]
csv=ON
blackhole=FORCE
archive=OFF
```

The
`--enable-plugin_name`
option format is a synonym for
`--plugin_name=ON`.
The
`--disable-plugin_name`
and
`--skip-plugin_name`
option formats are synonyms for
`--plugin_name=OFF`.

If a plugin is disabled, either explicitly with
`OFF` or implicitly because it was enabled with
`ON` but fails to initialize, aspects of server
operation requiring the plugin change. For example, if the
plugin implements a storage engine, existing tables for the
storage engine become inaccessible, and attempts to create new
tables for the storage engine result in tables that use the
default storage engine unless the
[`NO_ENGINE_SUBSTITUTION`](sql-mode.md#sqlmode_no_engine_substitution) SQL
mode is enabled to cause an error to occur instead.

Disabling a plugin may require adjustment to other options. For
example, if you start the server using
[`--skip-innodb`](innodb-parameters.md#option_mysqld_innodb)
to disable [`InnoDB`](innodb-storage-engine.md "Chapter 17 The InnoDB Storage Engine"), other
`innodb_xxx`
options likely also need to be omitted at startup. In addition,
because [`InnoDB`](innodb-storage-engine.md "Chapter 17 The InnoDB Storage Engine") is the default
storage engine, it cannot start unless you specify another
available storage engine with
[`--default_storage_engine`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_default_storage_engine). You
must also set
[`--default_tmp_storage_engine`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_default_tmp_storage_engine).

#### Uninstalling Plugins

At runtime, the [`UNINSTALL PLUGIN`](uninstall-plugin.md "15.7.4.6 UNINSTALL PLUGIN Statement")
statement disables and uninstalls a plugin known to the server.
The statement unloads the plugin and removes it from the
`mysql.plugin` system table, if it is
registered there. For this reason,
[`UNINSTALL PLUGIN`](uninstall-plugin.md "15.7.4.6 UNINSTALL PLUGIN Statement") statement
requires the [`DELETE`](privileges-provided.md#priv_delete) privilege for
the `mysql.plugin` table. With the plugin no
longer registered in the table, the server does not load the
plugin during subsequent restarts.

[`UNINSTALL PLUGIN`](uninstall-plugin.md "15.7.4.6 UNINSTALL PLUGIN Statement") can unload a
plugin regardless of whether it was loaded at runtime with
[`INSTALL PLUGIN`](install-plugin.md "15.7.4.4 INSTALL PLUGIN Statement") or at startup with
a plugin-loading option, subject to these conditions:

- It cannot unload plugins that are built in to the server.
  These can be identified as those that have a library name of
  `NULL` in the output from the Information
  Schema [`PLUGINS`](information-schema-plugins-table.md "28.3.22 The INFORMATION_SCHEMA PLUGINS Table") table or
  [`SHOW PLUGINS`](show-plugins.md "15.7.7.25 SHOW PLUGINS Statement").
- It cannot unload plugins for which the server was started
  with
  `--plugin_name=FORCE_PLUS_PERMANENT`,
  which prevents plugin unloading at runtime. These can be
  identified from the `LOAD_OPTION` column of
  the [`PLUGINS`](information-schema-plugins-table.md "28.3.22 The INFORMATION_SCHEMA PLUGINS Table") table.

To uninstall a plugin that currently is loaded at server startup
with a plugin-loading option, use this procedure.

1. Remove from the `my.cnf` file any options
   and system variables related to the plugin. If any plugin
   system variables were persisted to the
   `mysqld-auto.cnf` file, remove them using
   [`RESET PERSIST
   var_name`](reset-persist.md "15.7.8.7 RESET PERSIST Statement") for each one
   to remove it.
2. Restart the server.
3. Plugins normally are installed using either a plugin-loading
   option at startup or with [`INSTALL
   PLUGIN`](install-plugin.md "15.7.4.4 INSTALL PLUGIN Statement") at runtime, but not both. However, removing
   options for a plugin from the `my.cnf`
   file may not be sufficient to uninstall it if at some point
   [`INSTALL PLUGIN`](install-plugin.md "15.7.4.4 INSTALL PLUGIN Statement") has also been
   used. If the plugin still appears in the output from
   [`PLUGINS`](information-schema-plugins-table.md "28.3.22 The INFORMATION_SCHEMA PLUGINS Table") or
   [`SHOW PLUGINS`](show-plugins.md "15.7.7.25 SHOW PLUGINS Statement"), use
   [`UNINSTALL PLUGIN`](uninstall-plugin.md "15.7.4.6 UNINSTALL PLUGIN Statement") to remove it
   from the `mysql.plugin` table. Then restart
   the server again.

#### Plugins and Loadable Functions

A plugin when installed may also automatically install related
loadable functions. If so, the plugin when uninstalled also
automatically uninstalls those functions.
