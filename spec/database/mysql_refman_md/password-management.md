### 8.2.15 Password Management

MySQL supports these password-management capabilities:

- Password expiration, to require passwords to be changed
  periodically.
- Password reuse restrictions, to prevent old passwords from
  being chosen again.
- Password verification, to require that password changes also
  specify the current password to be replaced.
- Dual passwords, to enable clients to connect using either a
  primary or secondary password.
- Password strength assessment, to require strong passwords.
- Random password generation, as an alternative to requiring
  explicit administrator-specified literal passwords.
- Password failure tracking, to enable temporary account locking
  after too many consecutive incorrect-password login failures.

The following sections describe these capabilities, except
password strength assessment, which is implemented using the
`validate_password` component and is described in
[Section 8.4.3, “The Password Validation Component”](validate-password.md "8.4.3 The Password Validation Component").

- [Failed-Login Tracking and Temporary Account Locking](password-management.md#failed-login-tracking "Failed-Login Tracking and Temporary Account Locking")

Important

MySQL implements password-management capabilities using tables
in the `mysql` system database. If you upgrade
MySQL from an earlier version, your system tables might not be
up to date. In that case, the server writes messages similar to
these to the error log during the startup process (the exact
numbers may vary):

```none
[ERROR] Column count of mysql.user is wrong. Expected
49, found 47. The table is probably corrupted
[Warning] ACL table mysql.password_history missing.
Some operations may fail.
```

To correct the issue, perform the MySQL upgrade procedure. See
[Chapter 3, *Upgrading MySQL*](upgrading.md "Chapter 3 Upgrading MySQL"). Until this is done,
*password changes are not possible.*

#### Internal Versus External Credentials Storage

Some authentication plugins store account credentials internally
to MySQL, in the `mysql.user` system table:

- `caching_sha2_password`
- `mysql_native_password` (deprecated)
- `sha256_password` (deprecated)

Most discussion in this section applies to such authentication
plugins because most password-management capabilities described
here are based on internal credentials storage handled by MySQL
itself. Other authentication plugins store account credentials
externally to MySQL. For accounts that use plugins that perform
authentication against an external credentials system, password
management must be handled externally against that system as
well.

The exception is that the options for failed-login tracking and
temporary account locking apply to all accounts, not just
accounts that use internal credentials storage, because MySQL is
able to assess the status of login attempts for any account no
matter whether it uses internal or external credentials storage.

For information about individual authentication plugins, see
[Section 8.4.1, “Authentication Plugins”](authentication-plugins.md "8.4.1 Authentication Plugins").

#### Password Expiration Policy

MySQL enables database administrators to expire account
passwords manually, and to establish a policy for automatic
password expiration. Expiration policy can be established
globally, and individual accounts can be set to either defer to
the global policy or override the global policy with specific
per-account behavior.

To expire an account password manually, use the
[`ALTER USER`](alter-user.md "15.7.1.1 ALTER USER Statement") statement:

```sql
ALTER USER 'jeffrey'@'localhost' PASSWORD EXPIRE;
```

This operation marks the password expired in the corresponding
row in the `mysql.user` system table.

Password expiration according to policy is automatic and is
based on password age, which for a given account is assessed
from the date and time of its most recent password change. The
`mysql.user` system table indicates for each
account when its password was last changed, and the server
automatically treats the password as expired at client
connection time if its age is greater than its permitted
lifetime. This works with no explicit manual password
expiration.

To establish automatic password-expiration policy globally, use
the [`default_password_lifetime`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_default_password_lifetime)
system variable. Its default value is 0, which disables
automatic password expiration. If the value of
[`default_password_lifetime`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_default_password_lifetime) is a
positive integer *`N`*, it indicates the
permitted password lifetime, such that passwords must be changed
every *`N`* days.

Examples:

- To establish a global policy that passwords have a lifetime
  of approximately six months, start the server with these
  lines in a server `my.cnf` file:

  ```ini
  [mysqld]
  default_password_lifetime=180
  ```
- To establish a global policy such that passwords never
  expire, set
  [`default_password_lifetime`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_default_password_lifetime)
  to 0:

  ```ini
  [mysqld]
  default_password_lifetime=0
  ```
- [`default_password_lifetime`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_default_password_lifetime)
  can also be set and persisted at runtime:

  ```sql
  SET PERSIST default_password_lifetime = 180;
  SET PERSIST default_password_lifetime = 0;
  ```

  [`SET
  PERSIST`](set-variable.md "15.7.6.1 SET Syntax for Variable Assignment") sets a value for the running MySQL
  instance. It also saves the value to carry over to
  subsequent server restarts; see
  [Section 15.7.6.1, “SET Syntax for Variable Assignment”](set-variable.md "15.7.6.1 SET Syntax for Variable Assignment"). To change the value for the
  running MySQL instance without having it carry over to
  subsequent restarts, use the `GLOBAL`
  keyword rather than `PERSIST`.

The global password-expiration policy applies to all accounts
that have not been set to override it. To establish policy for
individual accounts, use the `PASSWORD EXPIRE`
option of the [`CREATE USER`](create-user.md "15.7.1.3 CREATE USER Statement") and
[`ALTER USER`](alter-user.md "15.7.1.1 ALTER USER Statement") statements. See
[Section 15.7.1.3, “CREATE USER Statement”](create-user.md "15.7.1.3 CREATE USER Statement"), and [Section 15.7.1.1, “ALTER USER Statement”](alter-user.md "15.7.1.1 ALTER USER Statement").

Example account-specific statements:

- Require the password to be changed every 90 days:

  ```sql
  CREATE USER 'jeffrey'@'localhost' PASSWORD EXPIRE INTERVAL 90 DAY;
  ALTER USER 'jeffrey'@'localhost' PASSWORD EXPIRE INTERVAL 90 DAY;
  ```

  This expiration option overrides the global policy for all
  accounts named by the statement.
- Disable password expiration:

  ```sql
  CREATE USER 'jeffrey'@'localhost' PASSWORD EXPIRE NEVER;
  ALTER USER 'jeffrey'@'localhost' PASSWORD EXPIRE NEVER;
  ```

  This expiration option overrides the global policy for all
  accounts named by the statement.
- Defer to the global expiration policy for all accounts named
  by the statement:

  ```sql
  CREATE USER 'jeffrey'@'localhost' PASSWORD EXPIRE DEFAULT;
  ALTER USER 'jeffrey'@'localhost' PASSWORD EXPIRE DEFAULT;
  ```

When a client successfully connects, the server determines
whether the account password has expired:

- The server checks whether the password has been manually
  expired.
- Otherwise, the server checks whether the password age is
  greater than its permitted lifetime according to the
  automatic password expiration policy. If so, the server
  considers the password expired.

If the password is expired (whether manually or automatically),
the server either disconnects the client or restricts the
operations permitted to it (see
[Section 8.2.16, “Server Handling of Expired Passwords”](expired-password-handling.md "8.2.16 Server Handling of Expired Passwords")). Operations
performed by a restricted client result in an error until the
user establishes a new account password:

```sql
mysql> SELECT 1;
ERROR 1820 (HY000): You must reset your password using ALTER USER
statement before executing this statement.

mysql> ALTER USER USER() IDENTIFIED BY 'password';
Query OK, 0 rows affected (0.01 sec)

mysql> SELECT 1;
+---+
| 1 |
+---+
| 1 |
+---+
1 row in set (0.00 sec)
```

After the client resets the password, the server restores normal
access for the session, as well as for subsequent connections
that use the account. It is also possible for an administrative
user to reset the account password, but any existing restricted
sessions for that account remain restricted. A client using the
account must disconnect and reconnect before statements can be
executed successfully.

Note

Although it is possible to “reset” an expired
password by setting it to its current value, it is preferable,
as a matter of good policy, to choose a different password.
DBAs can enforce non-reuse by establishing an appropriate
password-reuse policy. See
[Password Reuse Policy](password-management.md#password-reuse-policy "Password Reuse Policy").

#### Password Reuse Policy

MySQL enables restrictions to be placed on reuse of previous
passwords. Reuse restrictions can be established based on number
of password changes, time elapsed, or both. Reuse policy can be
established globally, and individual accounts can be set to
either defer to the global policy or override the global policy
with specific per-account behavior.

The password history for an account consists of passwords it has
been assigned in the past. MySQL can restrict new passwords from
being chosen from this history:

- If an account is restricted on the basis of number of
  password changes, a new password cannot be chosen from a
  specified number of the most recent passwords. For example,
  if the minimum number of password changes is set to 3, a new
  password cannot be the same as any of the most recent 3
  passwords.
- If an account is restricted based on time elapsed, a new
  password cannot be chosen from passwords in the history that
  are newer than a specified number of days. For example, if
  the password reuse interval is set to 60, a new password
  must not be among those previously chosen within the last 60
  days.

Note

The empty password does not count in the password history and
is subject to reuse at any time.

To establish password-reuse policy globally, use the
[`password_history`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_password_history) and
[`password_reuse_interval`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_password_reuse_interval) system
variables.

Examples:

- To prohibit reusing any of the last 6 passwords or passwords
  newer than 365 days, put these lines in the server
  `my.cnf` file:

  ```ini
  [mysqld]
  password_history=6
  password_reuse_interval=365
  ```
- To set and persist the variables at runtime, use statements
  like this:

  ```ini
  SET PERSIST password_history = 6;
  SET PERSIST password_reuse_interval = 365;
  ```

  [`SET
  PERSIST`](set-variable.md "15.7.6.1 SET Syntax for Variable Assignment") sets a value for the running MySQL
  instance. It also saves the value to carry over to
  subsequent server restarts; see
  [Section 15.7.6.1, “SET Syntax for Variable Assignment”](set-variable.md "15.7.6.1 SET Syntax for Variable Assignment"). To change the value for the
  running MySQL instance without having it carry over to
  subsequent restarts, use the `GLOBAL`
  keyword rather than `PERSIST`.

The global password-reuse policy applies to all accounts that
have not been set to override it. To establish policy for
individual accounts, use the `PASSWORD HISTORY`
and `PASSWORD REUSE INTERVAL` options of the
[`CREATE USER`](create-user.md "15.7.1.3 CREATE USER Statement") and
[`ALTER USER`](alter-user.md "15.7.1.1 ALTER USER Statement") statements. See
[Section 15.7.1.3, “CREATE USER Statement”](create-user.md "15.7.1.3 CREATE USER Statement"), and [Section 15.7.1.1, “ALTER USER Statement”](alter-user.md "15.7.1.1 ALTER USER Statement").

Example account-specific statements:

- Require a minimum of 5 password changes before permitting
  reuse:

  ```sql
  CREATE USER 'jeffrey'@'localhost' PASSWORD HISTORY 5;
  ALTER USER 'jeffrey'@'localhost' PASSWORD HISTORY 5;
  ```

  This history-length option overrides the global policy for
  all accounts named by the statement.
- Require a minimum of 365 days elapsed before permitting
  reuse:

  ```sql
  CREATE USER 'jeffrey'@'localhost' PASSWORD REUSE INTERVAL 365 DAY;
  ALTER USER 'jeffrey'@'localhost' PASSWORD REUSE INTERVAL 365 DAY;
  ```

  This time-elapsed option overrides the global policy for all
  accounts named by the statement.
- To combine both types of reuse restrictions, use
  `PASSWORD HISTORY` and `PASSWORD
  REUSE INTERVAL` together:

  ```sql
  CREATE USER 'jeffrey'@'localhost'
    PASSWORD HISTORY 5
    PASSWORD REUSE INTERVAL 365 DAY;
  ALTER USER 'jeffrey'@'localhost'
    PASSWORD HISTORY 5
    PASSWORD REUSE INTERVAL 365 DAY;
  ```

  These options override both global policy reuse restrictions
  for all accounts named by the statement.
- Defer to the global policy for both types of reuse
  restrictions:

  ```sql
  CREATE USER 'jeffrey'@'localhost'
    PASSWORD HISTORY DEFAULT
    PASSWORD REUSE INTERVAL DEFAULT;
  ALTER USER 'jeffrey'@'localhost'
    PASSWORD HISTORY DEFAULT
    PASSWORD REUSE INTERVAL DEFAULT;
  ```

#### Password Verification-Required Policy

As of MySQL 8.0.13, it is possible to require that attempts to
change an account password be verified by specifying the current
password to be replaced. This enables DBAs to prevent users from
changing a password without proving that they know the current
password. Such changes could otherwise occur, for example, if
one user walks away from a terminal session temporarily without
logging out, and a malicious user uses the session to change the
original user's MySQL password. This can have unfortunate
consequences:

- The original user becomes unable to access MySQL until the
  account password is reset by an administrator.
- Until the password reset occurs, the malicious user can
  access MySQL with the benign user's changed credentials.

Password-verification policy can be established globally, and
individual accounts can be set to either defer to the global
policy or override the global policy with specific per-account
behavior.

For each account, its `mysql.user` row
indicates whether there is an account-specific setting requiring
verification of the current password for password change
attempts. The setting is established by the `PASSWORD
REQUIRE` option of the [`CREATE
USER`](create-user.md "15.7.1.3 CREATE USER Statement") and [`ALTER USER`](alter-user.md "15.7.1.1 ALTER USER Statement")
statements:

- If the account setting is `PASSWORD REQUIRE
  CURRENT`, password changes must specify the current
  password.
- If the account setting is `PASSWORD REQUIRE CURRENT
  OPTIONAL`, password changes may but need not
  specify the current password.
- If the account setting is `PASSWORD REQUIRE CURRENT
  DEFAULT`, the
  [`password_require_current`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_password_require_current)
  system variable determines the verification-required policy
  for the account:

  - If
    [`password_require_current`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_password_require_current)
    is enabled, password changes must specify the current
    password.
  - If
    [`password_require_current`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_password_require_current)
    is disabled, password changes may but need not specify
    the current password.

In other words, if the account setting is not `PASSWORD
REQUIRE CURRENT DEFAULT`, the account setting takes
precedence over the global policy established by the
[`password_require_current`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_password_require_current) system
variable. Otherwise, the account defers to the
[`password_require_current`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_password_require_current)
setting.

By default, password verification is optional:
[`password_require_current`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_password_require_current) is
disabled and accounts created with no `PASSWORD
REQUIRE` option default to `PASSWORD REQUIRE
CURRENT DEFAULT`.

The following table shows how per-account settings interact with
[`password_require_current`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_password_require_current) system
variable values to determine account password
verification-required policy.

**Table 8.10 Password-Verification Policy**

| Per-Account Setting | password\_require\_current System Variable | Password Changes Require Current Password? |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `PASSWORD REQUIRE CURRENT` | `OFF` | Yes |
| `PASSWORD REQUIRE CURRENT` | `ON` | Yes |
| `PASSWORD REQUIRE CURRENT OPTIONAL` | `OFF` | No |
| `PASSWORD REQUIRE CURRENT OPTIONAL` | `ON` | No |
| `PASSWORD REQUIRE CURRENT DEFAULT` | `OFF` | No |
| `PASSWORD REQUIRE CURRENT DEFAULT` | `ON` | Yes |

Note

Privileged users can change any account password without
specifying the current password, regardless of the
verification-required policy. A privileged user is one who has
the global [`CREATE USER`](privileges-provided.md#priv_create-user)
privilege or the [`UPDATE`](privileges-provided.md#priv_update)
privilege for the `mysql` system database.

To establish password-verification policy globally, use the
[`password_require_current`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_password_require_current) system
variable. Its default value is `OFF`, so it is
not required that account password changes specify the current
password.

Examples:

- To establish a global policy that password changes must
  specify the current password, start the server with these
  lines in a server `my.cnf` file:

  ```ini
  [mysqld]
  password_require_current=ON
  ```
- To set and persist
  [`password_require_current`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_password_require_current) at
  runtime, use a statement such as one of these:

  ```sql
  SET PERSIST password_require_current = ON;
  SET PERSIST password_require_current = OFF;
  ```

  [`SET
  PERSIST`](set-variable.md "15.7.6.1 SET Syntax for Variable Assignment") sets a value for the running MySQL
  instance. It also saves the value to carry over to
  subsequent server restarts; see
  [Section 15.7.6.1, “SET Syntax for Variable Assignment”](set-variable.md "15.7.6.1 SET Syntax for Variable Assignment"). To change the value for the
  running MySQL instance without having it carry over to
  subsequent restarts, use the `GLOBAL`
  keyword rather than `PERSIST`.

The global password verification-required policy applies to all
accounts that have not been set to override it. To establish
policy for individual accounts, use the `PASSWORD
REQUIRE` options of the [`CREATE
USER`](create-user.md "15.7.1.3 CREATE USER Statement") and [`ALTER USER`](alter-user.md "15.7.1.1 ALTER USER Statement")
statements. See [Section 15.7.1.3, “CREATE USER Statement”](create-user.md "15.7.1.3 CREATE USER Statement"), and
[Section 15.7.1.1, “ALTER USER Statement”](alter-user.md "15.7.1.1 ALTER USER Statement").

Example account-specific statements:

- Require that password changes specify the current password:

  ```sql
  CREATE USER 'jeffrey'@'localhost' PASSWORD REQUIRE CURRENT;
  ALTER USER 'jeffrey'@'localhost' PASSWORD REQUIRE CURRENT;
  ```

  This verification option overrides the global policy for all
  accounts named by the statement.
- Do not require that password changes specify the current
  password (the current password may but need not be given):

  ```sql
  CREATE USER 'jeffrey'@'localhost' PASSWORD REQUIRE CURRENT OPTIONAL;
  ALTER USER 'jeffrey'@'localhost' PASSWORD REQUIRE CURRENT OPTIONAL;
  ```

  This verification option overrides the global policy for all
  accounts named by the statement.
- Defer to the global password verification-required policy
  for all accounts named by the statement:

  ```sql
  CREATE USER 'jeffrey'@'localhost' PASSWORD REQUIRE CURRENT DEFAULT;
  ALTER USER 'jeffrey'@'localhost' PASSWORD REQUIRE CURRENT DEFAULT;
  ```

Verification of the current password comes into play when a user
changes a password using the [`ALTER
USER`](alter-user.md "15.7.1.1 ALTER USER Statement") or [`SET PASSWORD`](set-password.md "15.7.1.10 SET PASSWORD Statement")
statement. The examples use [`ALTER
USER`](alter-user.md "15.7.1.1 ALTER USER Statement"), which is preferred over [`SET
PASSWORD`](set-password.md "15.7.1.10 SET PASSWORD Statement"), but the principles described here are the
same for both statements.

In password-change statements, a `REPLACE`
clause specifies the current password to be replaced. Examples:

- Change the current user's password:

  ```sql
  ALTER USER USER() IDENTIFIED BY 'auth_string' REPLACE 'current_auth_string';
  ```
- Change a named user's password:

  ```sql
  ALTER USER 'jeffrey'@'localhost'
    IDENTIFIED BY 'auth_string'
    REPLACE 'current_auth_string';
  ```
- Change a named user's authentication plugin and password:

  ```sql
  ALTER USER 'jeffrey'@'localhost'
    IDENTIFIED WITH caching_sha2_password BY 'auth_string'
    REPLACE 'current_auth_string';
  ```

The `REPLACE` clause works like this:

- `REPLACE` must be given if password changes
  for the account are required to specify the current
  password, as verification that the user attempting to make
  the change actually knows the current password.
- `REPLACE` is optional if password changes
  for the account may but need not specify the current
  password.
- If `REPLACE` is specified, it must specify
  the correct current password, or an error occurs. This is
  true even if `REPLACE` is optional.
- `REPLACE` can be specified only when
  changing the account password for the current user. (This
  means that in the examples just shown, the statements that
  explicitly name the account for `jeffrey`
  fail unless the current user is `jeffrey`.)
  This is true even if the change is attempted for another
  user by a privileged user; however, such a user can change
  any password without specifying `REPLACE`.
- `REPLACE` is omitted from the binary log to
  avoid writing cleartext passwords to it.

#### Dual Password Support

As of MySQL 8.0.14, user accounts are permitted to have dual
passwords, designated as primary and secondary passwords.
Dual-password capability makes it possible to seamlessly perform
credential changes in scenarios like this:

- A system has a large number of MySQL servers, possibly
  involving replication.
- Multiple applications connect to different MySQL servers.
- Periodic credential changes must be made to the account or
  accounts used by the applications to connect to the servers.

Consider how a credential change must be performed in the
preceding type of scenario when an account is permitted only a
single password. In this case, there must be close cooperation
in the timing of when the account password change is made and
propagated throughout all servers, and when all applications
that use the account are updated to use the new password. This
process may involve downtime during which servers or
applications are unavailable.

With dual passwords, credential changes can be made more easily,
in phases, without requiring close cooperation, and without
downtime:

1. For each affected account, establish a new primary password
   on the servers, retaining the current password as the
   secondary password. This enables servers to recognize either
   the primary or secondary password for each account, while
   applications can continue to connect to the servers using
   the same password as previously (which is now the secondary
   password).
2. After the password change has propagated to all servers,
   modify applications that use any affected account to connect
   using the account primary password.
3. After all applications have been migrated from the secondary
   passwords to the primary passwords, the secondary passwords
   are no longer needed and can be discarded. After this change
   has propagated to all servers, only the primary password for
   each account can be used to connect. The credential change
   is now complete.

MySQL implements dual-password capability with syntax that saves
and discards secondary passwords:

- The `RETAIN CURRENT PASSWORD` clause for
  the [`ALTER USER`](alter-user.md "15.7.1.1 ALTER USER Statement") and
  [`SET PASSWORD`](set-password.md "15.7.1.10 SET PASSWORD Statement") statements saves
  an account current password as its secondary password when
  you assign a new primary password.
- The `DISCARD OLD PASSWORD` clause for
  [`ALTER USER`](alter-user.md "15.7.1.1 ALTER USER Statement") discards an
  account secondary password, leaving only the primary
  password.

Suppose that, for the previously described credential-change
scenario, an account named
`'appuser1'@'host1.example.com'` is used by
applications to connect to servers, and that the account
password is to be changed from
`'password_a'` to
`'password_b'`.

To perform this change of credentials, use `ALTER
USER` as follows:

1. On each server that is not a replica, establish
   `'password_b'`
   as the new `appuser1` primary password,
   retaining the current password as the secondary password:

   ```sql
   ALTER USER 'appuser1'@'host1.example.com'
     IDENTIFIED BY 'password_b'
     RETAIN CURRENT PASSWORD;
   ```
2. Wait for the password change to replicate throughout the
   system to all replicas.
3. Modify each application that uses the
   `appuser1` account so that it connects to
   the servers using a password of
   `'password_b'`
   rather than
   `'password_a'`.
4. At this point, the secondary password is no longer needed.
   On each server that is not a replica, discard the secondary
   password:

   ```sql
   ALTER USER 'appuser1'@'host1.example.com'
     DISCARD OLD PASSWORD;
   ```
5. After the discard-password change has replicated to all
   replicas, the credential change is complete.

The `RETAIN CURRENT PASSWORD` and
`DISCARD OLD PASSWORD` clauses have the
following effects:

- `RETAIN CURRENT PASSWORD` retains an
  account current password as its secondary password,
  replacing any existing secondary password. The new password
  becomes the primary password, but clients can use the
  account to connect to the server using either the primary or
  secondary password. (Exception: If the new password
  specified by the [`ALTER USER`](alter-user.md "15.7.1.1 ALTER USER Statement")
  or [`SET PASSWORD`](set-password.md "15.7.1.10 SET PASSWORD Statement") statement is
  empty, the secondary password becomes empty as well, even if
  `RETAIN CURRENT PASSWORD` is given.)
- If you specify `RETAIN CURRENT PASSWORD`
  for an account that has an empty primary password, the
  statement fails.
- If an account has a secondary password and you change its
  primary password without specifying `RETAIN CURRENT
  PASSWORD`, the secondary password remains
  unchanged.
- For [`ALTER USER`](alter-user.md "15.7.1.1 ALTER USER Statement"), if you change
  the authentication plugin assigned to the account, the
  secondary password is discarded. If you change the
  authentication plugin and also specify `RETAIN
  CURRENT PASSWORD`, the statement fails.
- For [`ALTER USER`](alter-user.md "15.7.1.1 ALTER USER Statement"),
  `DISCARD OLD PASSWORD` discards the
  secondary password, if one exists. The account retains only
  its primary password, and clients can use the account to
  connect to the server only with the primary password.

Statements that modify secondary passwords require these
privileges:

- The
  [`APPLICATION_PASSWORD_ADMIN`](privileges-provided.md#priv_application-password-admin)
  privilege is required to use the `RETAIN CURRENT
  PASSWORD` or `DISCARD OLD
  PASSWORD` clause for [`ALTER
  USER`](alter-user.md "15.7.1.1 ALTER USER Statement") and [`SET
  PASSWORD`](set-password.md "15.7.1.10 SET PASSWORD Statement") statements that apply to your own
  account. The privilege is required to manipulate your own
  secondary password because most users require only one
  password.
- If an account is to be permitted to manipulate secondary
  passwords for all accounts, it should be granted the
  [`CREATE USER`](privileges-provided.md#priv_create-user) privilege rather
  than
  [`APPLICATION_PASSWORD_ADMIN`](privileges-provided.md#priv_application-password-admin).

#### Random Password Generation

As of MySQL 8.0.18, the [`CREATE
USER`](create-user.md "15.7.1.3 CREATE USER Statement"), [`ALTER USER`](alter-user.md "15.7.1.1 ALTER USER Statement"), and
[`SET PASSWORD`](set-password.md "15.7.1.10 SET PASSWORD Statement") statements have the
capability of generating random passwords for user accounts, as
an alternative to requiring explicit administrator-specified
literal passwords. See the description of each statement for
details about the syntax. This section describes the
characteristics common to generated random passwords.

By default, generated random passwords have a length of 20
characters. This length is controlled by the
[`generated_random_password_length`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_generated_random_password_length)
system variable, which has a range from 5 to 255.

For each account for which a statement generates a random
password, the statement stores the password in the
`mysql.user` system table, hashed appropriately
for the account authentication plugin. The statement also
returns the cleartext password in a row of a result set to make
it available to the user or application executing the statement.
The result set columns are named `user`,

A [`CREATE USER`](create-user.md "15.7.1.3 CREATE USER Statement"),
[`ALTER USER`](alter-user.md "15.7.1.1 ALTER USER Statement"), or
[`SET PASSWORD`](set-password.md "15.7.1.10 SET PASSWORD Statement") statement that
generates a random password for an account is written to the
binary log as a [`CREATE USER`](create-user.md "15.7.1.3 CREATE USER Statement") or
[`ALTER USER`](alter-user.md "15.7.1.1 ALTER USER Statement") statement with an
`IDENTIFIED WITH auth_plugin
AS 'auth_string'`, clause,
where *`auth_plugin`* is the account
authentication plugin and
`'auth_string'` is
the account hashed password value.

If the `validate_password` component is
installed, the policy that it implements has no effect on
generated passwords. (The purpose of password validation is to
help humans create better passwords.)

#### Failed-Login Tracking and Temporary Account Locking

As of MySQL 8.0.19, administrators can configure user accounts
such that too many consecutive login failures cause temporary
account locking.

“Login failure” in this context means failure of
the client to provide a correct password during a connection
attempt. It does not include failure to connect for reasons such
as unknown user or network issues. For accounts that have dual
passwords (see [Dual Password Support](password-management.md#dual-passwords "Dual Password Support")), either account
password counts as correct.

The required number of login failures and the lock time are
configurable per account, using the
`FAILED_LOGIN_ATTEMPTS` and
`PASSWORD_LOCK_TIME` options of the
[`CREATE USER`](create-user.md "15.7.1.3 CREATE USER Statement") and
[`ALTER USER`](alter-user.md "15.7.1.1 ALTER USER Statement") statements. Examples:

```sql
CREATE USER 'u1'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'password'
  FAILED_LOGIN_ATTEMPTS 3 PASSWORD_LOCK_TIME 3;

ALTER USER 'u2'@'localhost'
  FAILED_LOGIN_ATTEMPTS 4 PASSWORD_LOCK_TIME UNBOUNDED;
```

When too many consecutive login failures occur, the client
receives an error that looks like this:

```none
ERROR 3957 (HY000): Access denied for user user.
Account is blocked for D day(s) (R day(s) remaining)
due to N consecutive failed logins.
```

Use the options as follows:

- `FAILED_LOGIN_ATTEMPTS
  N`

  This option indicates whether to track account login
  attempts that specify an incorrect password. The number
  *`N`* specifies how many consecutive
  incorrect passwords cause temporary account locking.
- `PASSWORD_LOCK_TIME {N |
  UNBOUNDED}`

  This option indicates how long to lock the account after too
  many consecutive login attempts provide an incorrect
  password. The value is a number *`N`*
  to specify the number of days the account remains locked, or
  `UNBOUNDED` to specify that when an account
  enters the temporarily locked state, the duration of that
  state is unbounded and does not end until the account is
  unlocked. The conditions under which unlocking occurs are
  described later.

Permitted values of *`N`* for each option
are in the range from 0 to 32767. A value of 0 disables the
option.

Failed-login tracking and temporary account locking have these
characteristics:

- For failed-login tracking and temporary locking to occur for
  an account, its `FAILED_LOGIN_ATTEMPTS` and
  `PASSWORD_LOCK_TIME` options both must be
  nonzero.
- For [`CREATE USER`](create-user.md "15.7.1.3 CREATE USER Statement"), if
  `FAILED_LOGIN_ATTEMPTS` or
  `PASSWORD_LOCK_TIME` is not specified, its
  implicit default value is 0 for all accounts named by the
  statement. This means that failed-login tracking and
  temporary account locking are disabled. (These implicit
  defaults also apply to accounts created prior to the
  introduction of failed-login tracking.)
- For [`ALTER USER`](alter-user.md "15.7.1.1 ALTER USER Statement"), if
  `FAILED_LOGIN_ATTEMPTS` or
  `PASSWORD_LOCK_TIME` is not specified, its
  value remains unchanged for all accounts named by the
  statement.
- For temporary account locking to occur, password failures
  must be consecutive. Any successful login that occurs prior
  to reaching the `FAILED_LOGIN_ATTEMPTS`
  value for failed logins causes failure counting to reset.
  For example, if `FAILED_LOGIN_ATTEMPTS` is
  4 and three consecutive password failures have occurred, one
  more failure is necessary for locking to begin. But if the
  next login succeeds, failed-login counting for the account
  is reset so that four consecutive failures are again
  required for locking.
- Once temporary locking begins, successful login cannot occur
  even with the correct password until either the lock
  duration has passed or the account is unlocked by one of the
  account-reset methods listed in the following discussion.

When the server reads the grant tables, it initializes state
information for each account regarding whether failed-login
tracking is enabled, whether the account is currently
temporarily locked and when locking began if so, and the number
of failures before temporary locking occurs if the account is
not locked.

An account's state information can be reset, which means that
failed-login counting is reset, and the account is unlocked if
currently temporarily locked. Account resets can be global for
all accounts or per account:

- A global reset of all accounts occurs for any of these
  conditions:

  - A server restart.
  - Execution of [`FLUSH
    PRIVILEGES`](flush.md#flush-privileges). (Starting the server with
    [`--skip-grant-tables`](server-options.md#option_mysqld_skip-grant-tables)
    causes the grant tables not to be read, which disables
    failed-login tracking. In this case, the first execution
    of [`FLUSH PRIVILEGES`](flush.md#flush-privileges)
    causes the server to read the grant tables and enable
    failed-login tracking, in addition to resetting all
    accounts.)
- A per-account reset occurs for any of these conditions:

  - Successful login for the account.
  - The lock duration passes. In this case, failed-login
    counting resets at the time of the next login attempt.
  - Execution of an [`ALTER
    USER`](alter-user.md "15.7.1.1 ALTER USER Statement") statement for the account that sets
    either `FAILED_LOGIN_ATTEMPTS` or
    `PASSWORD_LOCK_TIME` (or both) to any
    value (including the current option value), or execution
    of an [`ALTER
    USER ... UNLOCK`](alter-user.md "15.7.1.1 ALTER USER Statement") statement for the account.

    Other [`ALTER USER`](alter-user.md "15.7.1.1 ALTER USER Statement")
    statements for the account have no effect on its current
    failed-login count or its locking state.

Failed-login tracking is tied to the login account that is used
to check credentials. If user proxying is in use, tracking
occurs for the proxy user, not the proxied user. That is,
tracking is tied to the account indicated by
[`USER()`](information-functions.md#function_user), not the account indicated
by [`CURRENT_USER()`](information-functions.md#function_current-user). For
information about the distinction between proxy and proxied
users, see [Section 8.2.19, “Proxy Users”](proxy-users.md "8.2.19 Proxy Users").
