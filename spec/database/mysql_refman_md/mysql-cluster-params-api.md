#### 25.4.2.3 NDB Cluster SQL Node and API Node Configuration Parameters

The listing in this section provides information about
parameters used in the `[mysqld]` and
`[api]` sections of a
`config.ini` file for configuring NDB Cluster
SQL nodes and API nodes. For detailed descriptions and other
additional information about each of these parameters, see
[Section 25.4.3.7, “Defining SQL and Other API Nodes in an NDB Cluster”](mysql-cluster-api-definition.md "25.4.3.7 Defining SQL and Other API Nodes in an NDB Cluster").

- `ApiVerbose`:
  Enable NDB API debugging; for NDB development.
- `ArbitrationDelay`:
  When asked to arbitrate, arbitrator waits this many
  milliseconds before voting.
- `ArbitrationRank`:
  If 0, then API node is not arbitrator. Kernel selects
  arbitrators in order 1, 2.
- `AutoReconnect`:
  Specifies whether an API node should reconnect fully when
  disconnected from cluster.
- `BatchByteSize`:
  Default batch size in bytes.
- `BatchSize`:
  Default batch size in number of records.
- `ConnectBackoffMaxTime`:
  Specifies longest time in milliseconds (~100ms resolution)
  to allow between connection attempts to any given data node
  by this API node. Excludes time elapsed while connection
  attempts are ongoing, which in worst case can take several
  seconds. Disable by setting to 0. If no data nodes are
  currently connected to this API node,
  StartConnectBackoffMaxTime is used instead.
- `ConnectionMap`:
  Specifies which data nodes to connect.
- `DefaultHashMapSize`:
  Set size (in buckets) to use for table hash maps. Three
  values are supported: 0, 240, and 3840.
- `DefaultOperationRedoProblemAction`:
  How operations are handled in event that
  RedoOverCommitCounter is exceeded.
- `ExecuteOnComputer`:
  String referencing earlier defined COMPUTER.
- `ExtraSendBufferMemory`:
  Memory to use for send buffers in addition to any allocated
  by TotalSendBufferMemory or SendBufferMemory. Default (0)
  allows up to 16MB.
- `HeartbeatThreadPriority`:
  Set heartbeat thread policy and priority for API nodes; see
  manual for allowed values.
- `HostName`:
  Host name or IP address for this SQL or API node.
- `Id`:
  Number identifying MySQL server or API node (Id). Now
  deprecated; use NodeId instead.
- `LocationDomainId`:
  Assign this API node to specific availability domain or
  zone. 0 (default) leaves this unset.
- `MaxScanBatchSize`:
  Maximum collective batch size for one scan.
- `NodeId`:
  Number uniquely identifying SQL node or API node among all
  nodes in cluster.
- `StartConnectBackoffMaxTime`:
  Same as ConnectBackoffMaxTime except that this parameter is
  used in its place if no data nodes are connected to this API
  node.
- `TotalSendBufferMemory`:
  Total memory to use for all transporter send buffers.
- `wan`:
  Use WAN TCP setting as default.

For a discussion of MySQL server options for NDB Cluster, see
[Section 25.4.3.9.1, “MySQL Server Options for NDB Cluster”](mysql-cluster-options-variables.md#mysql-cluster-program-options-mysqld "25.4.3.9.1 MySQL Server Options for NDB Cluster"). For
information about MySQL server system variables relating to NDB
Cluster, see [Section 25.4.3.9.2, “NDB Cluster System Variables”](mysql-cluster-options-variables.md#mysql-cluster-system-variables "25.4.3.9.2 NDB Cluster System Variables").

Note

To add new SQL or API nodes to the configuration of a running
NDB Cluster, it is necessary to perform a rolling restart of
all cluster nodes after adding new `[mysqld]`
or `[api]` sections to the
`config.ini` file (or files, if you are
using more than one management server). This must be done
before the new SQL or API nodes can connect to the cluster.

It is *not* necessary to perform any
restart of the cluster if new SQL or API nodes can employ
previously unused API slots in the cluster configuration to
connect to the cluster.
