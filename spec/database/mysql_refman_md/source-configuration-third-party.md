### 2.8.9 MySQL Configuration and Third-Party Tools

Third-party tools that need to determine the MySQL version from
the MySQL source can read the `MYSQL_VERSION`
file in the top-level source directory. The file lists the pieces
of the version separately. For example, if the version is MySQL
8.0.36, the file looks like this:

```simple
MYSQL_VERSION_MAJOR=8
MYSQL_VERSION_MINOR=0
MYSQL_VERSION_PATCH=36
MYSQL_VERSION_EXTRA=
MYSQL_VERSION_STABILITY="LTS"
```

Note

In MySQL 5.7 and earlier, this file was named
`VERSION`.

To construct a five-digit number from the version components, use
this formula:

```simple
MYSQL_VERSION_MAJOR*10000 + MYSQL_VERSION_MINOR*100 + MYSQL_VERSION_PATCH
```
