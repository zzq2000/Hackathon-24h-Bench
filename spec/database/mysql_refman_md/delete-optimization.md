#### 10.2.5.3 Optimizing DELETE Statements

The time required to delete individual rows in a
`MyISAM` table is exactly proportional to the
number of indexes. To delete rows more quickly, you can
increase the size of the key cache by increasing the
[`key_buffer_size`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_key_buffer_size) system
variable. See [Section 7.1.1, “Configuring the Server”](server-configuration.md "7.1.1 Configuring the Server").

To delete all rows from a `MyISAM` table,
`TRUNCATE TABLE
tbl_name` is faster than
`DELETE FROM
tbl_name`. Truncate
operations are not transaction-safe; an error occurs when
attempting one in the course of an active transaction or
active table lock. See [Section 15.1.37, “TRUNCATE TABLE Statement”](truncate-table.md "15.1.37 TRUNCATE TABLE Statement").
