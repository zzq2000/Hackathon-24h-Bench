#### 25.3.1.4 Building NDB Cluster from Source on Linux

This section provides information about compiling NDB Cluster on
Linux and other Unix-like platforms. Building NDB Cluster from
source is similar to building the standard MySQL Server,
although it differs in a few key respects discussed here. For
general information about building MySQL from source, see
[Section 2.8, “Installing MySQL from Source”](source-installation.md "2.8 Installing MySQL from Source"). For information about
compiling NDB Cluster on Windows platforms, see
[Section 25.3.2.2, “Compiling and Installing NDB Cluster from Source on Windows”](mysql-cluster-install-windows-source.md "25.3.2.2 Compiling and Installing NDB Cluster from Source on Windows").

Building MySQL NDB Cluster 8.0 requires using the MySQL Server
8.0 sources. These are available from the MySQL downloads page
at <https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/>. The archived source file
should have a name similar to
`mysql-8.0.43.tar.gz`. You
can also obtain the sources from GitHub at
<https://github.com/mysql/mysql-server>.

Note

In previous versions, building of NDB Cluster from standard
MySQL Server sources was not supported. In MySQL 8.0 and NDB
Cluster 8.0, this is no longer the case—*both
products are now built from the same sources*.

The [`WITH_NDB`](source-configuration-options.md#option_cmake_with_ndb) option for
**CMake** causes the binaries for the management
nodes, data nodes, and other NDB Cluster programs to be built;
it also causes [**mysqld**](mysqld.md "6.3.1 mysqld — The MySQL Server") to be compiled with
[`NDB`](mysql-cluster.md "Chapter 25 MySQL NDB Cluster 8.0") storage engine support. This
option (or, prior to NDB 8.0.31,
[`WITH_NDBCLUSTER`](source-configuration-options.md#option_cmake_with_ndbcluster)) is required when
building NDB Cluster.

Important

The [`WITH_NDB_JAVA`](source-configuration-options.md#option_cmake_with_ndb_java) option is
enabled by default. This means that, by default, if
**CMake** cannot find the location of Java on
your system, the configuration process fails; if you do not
wish to enable Java and ClusterJ support, you must indicate
this explicitly by configuring the build using
`-DWITH_NDB_JAVA=OFF`. Use
[`WITH_CLASSPATH`](source-configuration-options.md#option_cmake_with_classpath) to provide the
Java classpath if needed.

For more information about **CMake** options
specific to building NDB Cluster, see
[CMake Options for Compiling NDB Cluster](source-configuration-options.md#cmake-mysql-cluster-options "CMake Options for Compiling NDB Cluster").

After you have run **make && make
install** (or your system's equivalent), the result
is similar to what is obtained by unpacking a precompiled binary
to the same location.

**Management nodes.**
When building from source and running the default
**make install**, the management server and
management client binaries ([**ndb\_mgmd**](mysql-cluster-programs-ndb-mgmd.md "25.5.4 ndb_mgmd — The NDB Cluster Management Server Daemon") and
[**ndb\_mgm**](mysql-cluster-programs-ndb-mgm.md "25.5.5 ndb_mgm — The NDB Cluster Management Client")) can be found in
`/usr/local/mysql/bin`. Only
[**ndb\_mgmd**](mysql-cluster-programs-ndb-mgmd.md "25.5.4 ndb_mgmd — The NDB Cluster Management Server Daemon") is required to be present on a
management node host; however, it is also a good idea to have
[**ndb\_mgm**](mysql-cluster-programs-ndb-mgm.md "25.5.5 ndb_mgm — The NDB Cluster Management Client") present on the same host machine.
Neither of these executables requires a specific location on
the host machine's file system.

**Data nodes.**
The only executable required on a data node host is the data
node binary [**ndbd**](mysql-cluster-programs-ndbd.md "25.5.1 ndbd — The NDB Cluster Data Node Daemon") or
[**ndbmtd**](mysql-cluster-programs-ndbmtd.md "25.5.3 ndbmtd — The NDB Cluster Data Node Daemon (Multi-Threaded)"). ([**mysqld**](mysqld.md "6.3.1 mysqld — The MySQL Server"), for
example, does not have to be present on the host machine.) By
default, when building from source, this file is placed in the
directory `/usr/local/mysql/bin`. For
installing on multiple data node hosts, only
[**ndbd**](mysql-cluster-programs-ndbd.md "25.5.1 ndbd — The NDB Cluster Data Node Daemon") or [**ndbmtd**](mysql-cluster-programs-ndbmtd.md "25.5.3 ndbmtd — The NDB Cluster Data Node Daemon (Multi-Threaded)") need be
copied to the other host machine or machines. (This assumes
that all data node hosts use the same architecture and
operating system; otherwise you may need to compile separately
for each different platform.) The data node binary need not be
in any particular location on the host's file system, as long
as the location is known.

When compiling NDB Cluster from source, no special options are
required for building multithreaded data node binaries.
Configuring the build with [`NDB`](mysql-cluster.md "Chapter 25 MySQL NDB Cluster 8.0")
storage engine support causes [**ndbmtd**](mysql-cluster-programs-ndbmtd.md "25.5.3 ndbmtd — The NDB Cluster Data Node Daemon (Multi-Threaded)") to be
built automatically; **make install** places the
[**ndbmtd**](mysql-cluster-programs-ndbmtd.md "25.5.3 ndbmtd — The NDB Cluster Data Node Daemon (Multi-Threaded)") binary in the installation
`bin` directory along with
[**mysqld**](mysqld.md "6.3.1 mysqld — The MySQL Server"), [**ndbd**](mysql-cluster-programs-ndbd.md "25.5.1 ndbd — The NDB Cluster Data Node Daemon"), and
[**ndb\_mgm**](mysql-cluster-programs-ndb-mgm.md "25.5.5 ndb_mgm — The NDB Cluster Management Client").

**SQL nodes.**
If you compile MySQL with clustering support, and perform the
default installation (using **make install** as
the system `root` user),
[**mysqld**](mysqld.md "6.3.1 mysqld — The MySQL Server") is placed in
`/usr/local/mysql/bin`. Follow the steps
given in [Section 2.8, “Installing MySQL from Source”](source-installation.md "2.8 Installing MySQL from Source") to make
[**mysqld**](mysqld.md "6.3.1 mysqld — The MySQL Server") ready for use. If you want to run
multiple SQL nodes, you can use a copy of the same
[**mysqld**](mysqld.md "6.3.1 mysqld — The MySQL Server") executable and its associated
support files on several machines. The easiest way to do this
is to copy the entire `/usr/local/mysql`
directory and all directories and files contained within it to
the other SQL node host or hosts, then repeat the steps from
[Section 2.8, “Installing MySQL from Source”](source-installation.md "2.8 Installing MySQL from Source") on each machine. If you
configure the build with a nondefault `PREFIX`
option, you must adjust the directory accordingly.

In [Section 25.3.3, “Initial Configuration of NDB Cluster”](mysql-cluster-install-configuration.md "25.3.3 Initial Configuration of NDB Cluster"), we
create configuration files for all of the nodes in our example
NDB Cluster.
