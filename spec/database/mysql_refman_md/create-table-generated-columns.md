#### 15.1.20.8 CREATE TABLE and Generated Columns

[`CREATE TABLE`](create-table.md "15.1.20 CREATE TABLE Statement") supports the
specification of generated columns. Values of a generated column
are computed from an expression included in the column
definition.

Generated columns are also supported by the
[`NDB`](mysql-cluster.md "Chapter 25 MySQL NDB Cluster 8.0") storage engine.

The following simple example shows a table that stores the
lengths of the sides of right triangles in the
`sidea` and `sideb` columns,
and computes the length of the hypotenuse in
`sidec` (the square root of the sums of the
squares of the other sides):

```sql
CREATE TABLE triangle (
  sidea DOUBLE,
  sideb DOUBLE,
  sidec DOUBLE AS (SQRT(sidea * sidea + sideb * sideb))
);
INSERT INTO triangle (sidea, sideb) VALUES(1,1),(3,4),(6,8);
```

Selecting from the table yields this result:

```sql
mysql> SELECT * FROM triangle;
+-------+-------+--------------------+
| sidea | sideb | sidec              |
+-------+-------+--------------------+
|     1 |     1 | 1.4142135623730951 |
|     3 |     4 |                  5 |
|     6 |     8 |                 10 |
+-------+-------+--------------------+
```

Any application that uses the `triangle` table
has access to the hypotenuse values without having to specify
the expression that calculates them.

Generated column definitions have this syntax:

```sql
col_name data_type [GENERATED ALWAYS] AS (expr)
  [VIRTUAL | STORED] [NOT NULL | NULL]
  [UNIQUE [KEY]] [[PRIMARY] KEY]
  [COMMENT 'string']
```

`AS (expr)`
indicates that the column is generated and defines the
expression used to compute column values. `AS`
may be preceded by `GENERATED ALWAYS` to make
the generated nature of the column more explicit. Constructs
that are permitted or prohibited in the expression are discussed
later.

The `VIRTUAL` or `STORED`
keyword indicates how column values are stored, which has
implications for column use:

- `VIRTUAL`: Column values are not stored,
  but are evaluated when rows are read, immediately after any
  `BEFORE` triggers. A virtual column takes
  no storage.

  `InnoDB` supports secondary indexes on
  virtual columns. See
  [Section 15.1.20.9, “Secondary Indexes and Generated Columns”](create-table-secondary-indexes.md "15.1.20.9 Secondary Indexes and Generated Columns").
- `STORED`: Column values are evaluated and
  stored when rows are inserted or updated. A stored column
  does require storage space and can be indexed.

The default is `VIRTUAL` if neither keyword is
specified.

It is permitted to mix `VIRTUAL` and
`STORED` columns within a table.

Other attributes may be given to indicate whether the column is
indexed or can be `NULL`, or provide a comment.

Generated column expressions must adhere to the following rules.
An error occurs if an expression contains disallowed constructs.

- Literals, deterministic built-in functions, and operators
  are permitted. A function is deterministic if, given the
  same data in tables, multiple invocations produce the same
  result, independently of the connected user. Examples of
  functions that are nondeterministic and fail this
  definition: [`CONNECTION_ID()`](information-functions.md#function_connection-id),
  [`CURRENT_USER()`](information-functions.md#function_current-user),
  [`NOW()`](date-and-time-functions.md#function_now).
- Stored functions and loadable functions are not permitted.
- Stored procedure and function parameters are not permitted.
- Variables (system variables, user-defined variables, and
  stored program local variables) are not permitted.
- Subqueries are not permitted.
- A generated column definition can refer to other generated
  columns, but only those occurring earlier in the table
  definition. A generated column definition can refer to any
  base (nongenerated) column in the table whether its
  definition occurs earlier or later.
- The `AUTO_INCREMENT` attribute cannot be
  used in a generated column definition.
- An `AUTO_INCREMENT` column cannot be used
  as a base column in a generated column definition.
- If expression evaluation causes truncation or provides
  incorrect input to a function, the
  [`CREATE TABLE`](create-table.md "15.1.20 CREATE TABLE Statement") statement
  terminates with an error and the DDL operation is rejected.

If the expression evaluates to a data type that differs from the
declared column type, implicit coercion to the declared type
occurs according to the usual MySQL type-conversion rules. See
[Section 14.3, “Type Conversion in Expression Evaluation”](type-conversion.md "14.3 Type Conversion in Expression Evaluation").

If a generated column uses the
[`TIMESTAMP`](datetime.md "13.2.2 The DATE, DATETIME, and TIMESTAMP Types") data type, the setting
for
[`explicit_defaults_for_timestamp`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_explicit_defaults_for_timestamp)
is ignored. In such cases, if this variable is disabled then
`NULL` is not converted to
[`CURRENT_TIMESTAMP`](date-and-time-functions.md#function_current-timestamp). In MySQL
8.0.22 and later, if the column is also declared as `NOT
NULL`, attempting to insert `NULL` is
explicitly rejected with
[`ER_BAD_NULL_ERROR`](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/mysql-errors/8.0/en/server-error-reference.html#error_er_bad_null_error).

Note

Expression evaluation uses the SQL mode in effect at
evaluation time. If any component of the expression depends on
the SQL mode, different results may occur for different uses
of the table unless the SQL mode is the same during all uses.

For [`CREATE
TABLE ... LIKE`](create-table-like.md "15.1.20.3 CREATE TABLE ... LIKE Statement"), the destination table preserves
generated column information from the original table.

For [`CREATE
TABLE ... SELECT`](create-table-select.md "15.1.20.4 CREATE TABLE ... SELECT Statement"), the destination table does not
preserve information about whether columns in the selected-from
table are generated columns. The
[`SELECT`](select.md "15.2.13 SELECT Statement") part of the statement
cannot assign values to generated columns in the destination
table.

Partitioning by generated columns is permitted. See
[Table Partitioning](create-table.md#create-table-partitioning "Table Partitioning").

A foreign key constraint on a stored generated column cannot use
`CASCADE`, `SET NULL`, or
`SET DEFAULT` as `ON UPDATE`
referential actions, nor can it use `SET NULL`
or `SET DEFAULT` as `ON
DELETE` referential actions.

A foreign key constraint on the base column of a stored
generated column cannot use `CASCADE`,
`SET NULL`, or `SET DEFAULT`
as `ON UPDATE` or `ON DELETE`
referential actions.

A foreign key constraint cannot reference a virtual generated
column.

Triggers cannot use
`NEW.col_name` or
use `OLD.col_name`
to refer to generated columns.

For [`INSERT`](insert.md "15.2.7 INSERT Statement"),
[`REPLACE`](replace.md "15.2.12 REPLACE Statement"), and
[`UPDATE`](update.md "15.2.17 UPDATE Statement"), if a generated column is
inserted into, replaced, or updated explicitly, the only
permitted value is `DEFAULT`.

A generated column in a view is considered updatable because it
is possible to assign to it. However, if such a column is
updated explicitly, the only permitted value is
`DEFAULT`.

Generated columns have several use cases, such as these:

- Virtual generated columns can be used as a way to simplify
  and unify queries. A complicated condition can be defined as
  a generated column and referred to from multiple queries on
  the table to ensure that all of them use exactly the same
  condition.
- Stored generated columns can be used as a materialized cache
  for complicated conditions that are costly to calculate on
  the fly.
- Generated columns can simulate functional indexes: Use a
  generated column to define a functional expression and index
  it. This can be useful for working with columns of types
  that cannot be indexed directly, such as
  [`JSON`](json.md "13.5 The JSON Data Type") columns; see
  [Indexing a Generated Column to Provide a JSON Column Index](create-table-secondary-indexes.md#json-column-indirect-index "Indexing a Generated Column to Provide a JSON Column Index"), for a detailed
  example.

  For stored generated columns, the disadvantage of this
  approach is that values are stored twice; once as the value
  of the generated column and once in the index.
- If a generated column is indexed, the optimizer recognizes
  query expressions that match the column definition and uses
  indexes from the column as appropriate during query
  execution, even if a query does not refer to the column
  directly by name. For details, see
  [Section 10.3.11, “Optimizer Use of Generated Column Indexes”](generated-column-index-optimizations.md "10.3.11 Optimizer Use of Generated Column Indexes").

Example:

Suppose that a table `t1` contains
`first_name` and `last_name`
columns and that applications frequently construct the full name
using an expression like this:

```sql
SELECT CONCAT(first_name,' ',last_name) AS full_name FROM t1;
```

One way to avoid writing out the expression is to create a view
`v1` on `t1`, which simplifies
applications by enabling them to select
`full_name` directly without using an
expression:

```sql
CREATE VIEW v1 AS
SELECT *, CONCAT(first_name,' ',last_name) AS full_name FROM t1;

SELECT full_name FROM v1;
```

A generated column also enables applications to select
`full_name` directly without the need to define
a view:

```sql
CREATE TABLE t1 (
  first_name VARCHAR(10),
  last_name VARCHAR(10),
  full_name VARCHAR(255) AS (CONCAT(first_name,' ',last_name))
);

SELECT full_name FROM t1;
```
