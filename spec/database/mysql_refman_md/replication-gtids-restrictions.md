#### 19.1.3.7 Restrictions on Replication with GTIDs

Because GTID-based replication is dependent on transactions, some
features otherwise available in MySQL are not supported when using
it. This section provides information about restrictions on and
limitations of replication with GTIDs.

**Updates involving nontransactional storage engines.**
When using GTIDs, updates to tables using nontransactional
storage engines such as [`MyISAM`](myisam-storage-engine.md "18.2 The MyISAM Storage Engine")
cannot be made in the same statement or transaction as updates
to tables using transactional storage engines such as
[`InnoDB`](innodb-storage-engine.md "Chapter 17 The InnoDB Storage Engine").

This restriction is due to the fact that updates to tables that
use a nontransactional storage engine mixed with updates to tables
that use a transactional storage engine within the same
transaction can result in multiple GTIDs being assigned to the
same transaction.

Such problems can also occur when the source and the replica use
different storage engines for their respective versions of the
same table, where one storage engine is transactional and the
other is not. Also be aware that triggers that are defined to
operate on nontransactional tables can be the cause of these
problems.

In any of the cases just mentioned, the one-to-one correspondence
between transactions and GTIDs is broken, with the result that
GTID-based replication cannot function correctly.

**CREATE TABLE ... SELECT statements.**
Prior to MySQL 8.0.21,
[`CREATE
TABLE ... SELECT`](create-table-select.md "15.1.20.4 CREATE TABLE ... SELECT Statement") statements are not allowed when using
GTID-based replication. When
[`binlog_format`](replication-options-binary-log.md#sysvar_binlog_format) is set to
`STATEMENT`, a
[`CREATE
TABLE ... SELECT`](create-table-select.md "15.1.20.4 CREATE TABLE ... SELECT Statement") statement is recorded in the binary
log as one transaction with one GTID, but if
`ROW` format is used, the statement is recorded
as two transactions with two GTIDs. If a source used
`STATEMENT` format and a replica used
`ROW` format, the replica would be unable to
handle the transaction correctly, therefore the
[`CREATE
TABLE ... SELECT`](create-table-select.md "15.1.20.4 CREATE TABLE ... SELECT Statement") statement is disallowed with GTIDs to
prevent this scenario. This restriction is lifted in MySQL
8.0.21 on storage engines that support atomic DDL. In this case,
[`CREATE
TABLE ... SELECT`](create-table-select.md "15.1.20.4 CREATE TABLE ... SELECT Statement") is recorded in the binary log as one
transaction. For more information, see
[Section 15.1.1, “Atomic Data Definition Statement Support”](atomic-ddl.md "15.1.1 Atomic Data Definition Statement Support").

**Temporary tables.**
When [`binlog_format`](replication-options-binary-log.md#sysvar_binlog_format) is set to
`STATEMENT`,
[`CREATE TEMPORARY
TABLE`](create-table.md "15.1.20 CREATE TABLE Statement") and
[`DROP TEMPORARY
TABLE`](drop-table.md "15.1.32 DROP TABLE Statement") statements cannot be used inside transactions,
procedures, functions, and triggers when GTIDs are in use on the
server (that is, when the
[`enforce_gtid_consistency`](replication-options-gtids.md#sysvar_enforce_gtid_consistency) system
variable is set to `ON`). They can be used
outside these contexts when GTIDs are in use, provided that
[`autocommit=1`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_autocommit) is set. From MySQL
8.0.13, when [`binlog_format`](replication-options-binary-log.md#sysvar_binlog_format) is
set to `ROW` or `MIXED`,
[`CREATE TEMPORARY
TABLE`](create-table.md "15.1.20 CREATE TABLE Statement") and
[`DROP TEMPORARY
TABLE`](drop-table.md "15.1.32 DROP TABLE Statement") statements are allowed inside a transaction,
procedure, function, or trigger when GTIDs are in use. The
statements are not written to the binary log and are therefore
not replicated to replicas. The use of row-based replication
means that the replicas remain in sync without the need to
replicate temporary tables. If the removal of these statements
from a transaction results in an empty transaction, the
transaction is not written to the binary log.

**Preventing execution of unsupported statements.**
To prevent execution of statements that would cause GTID-based
replication to fail, all servers must be started with the
[`--enforce-gtid-consistency`](replication-options-gtids.md#sysvar_enforce_gtid_consistency) option
when enabling GTIDs. This causes statements of any of the types
discussed previously in this section to fail with an error.

Note that
[`--enforce-gtid-consistency`](replication-options-gtids.md#sysvar_enforce_gtid_consistency) only
takes effect if binary logging takes place for a statement. If
binary logging is disabled on the server, or if statements are not
written to the binary log because they are removed by a filter,
GTID consistency is not checked or enforced for the statements
that are not logged.

For information about other required startup options when enabling
GTIDs, see [Section 19.1.3.4, “Setting Up Replication Using GTIDs”](replication-gtids-howto.md "19.1.3.4 Setting Up Replication Using GTIDs").

**Skipping transactions.**
[`sql_replica_skip_counter`](replication-options-replica.md#sysvar_sql_replica_skip_counter) or
[`sql_slave_skip_counter`](replication-options-replica.md#sysvar_sql_slave_skip_counter) is not
available when using GTID-based replication. If you need to skip
transactions, use the value of the source's
[`gtid_executed`](replication-options-gtids.md#sysvar_gtid_executed) variable instead.
If you have enabled GTID assignment on a replication channel
using the
`ASSIGN_GTIDS_TO_ANONYMOUS_TRANSACTIONS` option
of the [`CHANGE REPLICATION SOURCE
TO`](change-replication-source-to.md "15.4.2.3 CHANGE REPLICATION SOURCE TO Statement") statement,
[`sql_replica_skip_counter`](replication-options-replica.md#sysvar_sql_replica_skip_counter) or
[`sql_slave_skip_counter`](replication-options-replica.md#sysvar_sql_slave_skip_counter) is
available. For more information, see
[Section 19.1.7.3, “Skipping Transactions”](replication-administration-skip.md "19.1.7.3 Skipping Transactions").

**Ignoring servers.**
The IGNORE\_SERVER\_IDS option of the [`CHANGE
REPLICATION SOURCE TO`](change-replication-source-to.md "15.4.2.3 CHANGE REPLICATION SOURCE TO Statement") | [`CHANGE
MASTER TO`](change-master-to.md "15.4.2.1 CHANGE MASTER TO Statement") statement is deprecated when using GTIDs,
because transactions that have already been applied are
automatically ignored. Before starting GTID-based replication,
check for and clear all ignored server ID lists that have
previously been set on the servers involved. The
[`SHOW REPLICA STATUS`](show-replica-status.md "15.7.7.35 SHOW REPLICA STATUS Statement") statement,
which can be issued for individual channels, displays the list
of ignored server IDs if there is one. If there is no list, the
`Replicate_Ignore_Server_Ids` field is blank.

**GTID mode and mysql\_upgrade.**
Prior to MySQL 8.0.16, when the server is running with global
transaction identifiers (GTIDs) enabled
([`gtid_mode=ON`](replication-options-gtids.md#sysvar_gtid_mode)), do not enable
binary logging by [**mysql\_upgrade**](mysql-upgrade.md "6.4.5 mysql_upgrade — Check and Upgrade MySQL Tables") (the
[`--write-binlog`](mysql-upgrade.md#option_mysql_upgrade_write-binlog) option). As
of MySQL 8.0.16, the server performs the entire MySQL upgrade
procedure, but disables binary logging during the upgrade, so
there is no issue.
