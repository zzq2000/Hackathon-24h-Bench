### 20.3.1 Group Replication Requirements

- [Infrastructure](group-replication-requirements.md#group-replication-infrastructure "Infrastructure")
- [Server Instance Configuration](group-replication-requirements.md#group-replication-configuration "Server Instance Configuration")

Server instances that you want to use for Group Replication must
satisfy the following requirements.

#### Infrastructure

- **InnoDB Storage Engine.**
  Data must be stored in the
  [`InnoDB`](innodb-storage-engine.md "Chapter 17 The InnoDB Storage Engine") transactional storage
  engine. Transactions are executed optimistically and then,
  at commit time, are checked for conflicts. If there are
  conflicts, in order to maintain consistency across the
  group, some transactions are rolled back. This means that
  a transactional storage engine is required. Moreover,
  [`InnoDB`](innodb-storage-engine.md "Chapter 17 The InnoDB Storage Engine") provides some
  additional functionality that enables better management
  and handling of conflicts when operating together with
  Group Replication. The use of other storage engines,
  including the temporary
  [`MEMORY`](memory-storage-engine.md "18.3 The MEMORY Storage Engine") storage engine, might
  cause errors in Group Replication. Convert any tables in
  other storage engines to use
  [`InnoDB`](innodb-storage-engine.md "Chapter 17 The InnoDB Storage Engine") before using the
  instance with Group Replication. You can prevent the use
  of other storage engines by setting the
  [`disabled_storage_engines`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_disabled_storage_engines)
  system variable on group members, for example:

  ```ini
  disabled_storage_engines="MyISAM,BLACKHOLE,FEDERATED,ARCHIVE,MEMORY"
  ```
- **Primary Keys.**
  Every table that is to be replicated by the group must
  have a defined primary key, or primary key equivalent
  where the equivalent is a non-null unique key. Such keys
  are required as a unique identifier for every row within a
  table, enabling the system to determine which transactions
  conflict by identifying exactly which rows each
  transaction has modified. Group Replication has its own
  built-in set of checks for primary keys or primary key
  equivalents, and does not use the checks carried out by
  the
  [`sql_require_primary_key`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_sql_require_primary_key)
  system variable. You may set
  `sql_require_primary_key=ON` for a server
  instance where Group Replication is running, and you may
  set the `REQUIRE_TABLE_PRIMARY_KEY_CHECK`
  option of the [`CHANGE REPLICATION
  SOURCE TO`](change-replication-source-to.md "15.4.2.3 CHANGE REPLICATION SOURCE TO Statement") | [`CHANGE MASTER
  TO`](change-master-to.md "15.4.2.1 CHANGE MASTER TO Statement") statement to `ON` for a
  Group Replication channel. However, be aware that you
  might find some transactions that are permitted under
  Group Replication's built-in checks are not permitted
  under the checks carried out when you set
  `sql_require_primary_key=ON` or
  `REQUIRE_TABLE_PRIMARY_KEY_CHECK=ON`.
- **Network Performance.**
  MySQL Group Replication is designed to be deployed in a
  cluster environment where server instances are very close
  to each other. The performance and stability of a group
  can be impacted by both network latency and network
  bandwidth. Bi-directional communication must be maintained
  at all times between all group members. If either inbound
  or outbound communication is blocked for a server instance
  (for example, by a firewall, or by connectivity issues),
  the member cannot function in the group, and the group
  members (including the member with issues) might not be
  able to report the correct member status for the affected
  server instance.

  From MySQL 8.0.14, you can use an IPv4 or IPv6 network
  infrastructure, or a mix of the two, for TCP communication
  between remote Group Replication servers. There is also
  nothing preventing Group Replication from operating over a
  virtual private network (VPN).

  Also from MySQL 8.0.14, where Group Replication server
  instances are co-located and share a local group
  communication engine (XCom) instance, a dedicated input
  channel with lower overhead is used for communication where
  possible instead of the TCP socket. For certain Group
  Replication tasks that require communication between remote
  XCom instances, such as joining a group, the TCP network is
  still used, so network performance influences the group's
  performance.

#### Server Instance Configuration

The following options must be configured as shown on server
instances that are members of a group.

- **Unique Server Identifier.**
  Use the [`server_id`](replication-options.md#sysvar_server_id) system
  variable to configure the server with a unique server ID,
  as required for all servers in replication topologies. The
  server ID must be a positive integer between 1 and
  (232)−1, and it must be
  different from every other server ID in use by any other
  server in the replication topology.
- **Binary Log Active.**
  Set
  [`--log-bin[=log_file_name]`](replication-options-binary-log.md#sysvar_log_bin).
  From MySQL 8.0, binary logging is enabled by default, and
  you do not need to specify this option unless you want to
  change the name of the binary log files. Group Replication
  replicates the binary log's contents, therefore the binary
  log needs to be on for it to operate. See
  [Section 7.4.4, “The Binary Log”](binary-log.md "7.4.4 The Binary Log").
- **Replica Updates Logged.**
  Set
  [`log_replica_updates=ON`](replication-options-binary-log.md#sysvar_log_replica_updates)
  (from MySQL 8.0.26) or
  [`log_slave_updates=ON`](replication-options-binary-log.md#sysvar_log_slave_updates)
  (before MySQL 8.0.26). From MySQL 8.0, this setting is the
  default, so you do not need to specify it. Group members
  need to log transactions that are received from their
  donors at joining time and applied through the replication
  applier, and to log all transactions that they receive and
  apply from the group. This enables Group Replication to
  carry out distributed recovery by state transfer from an
  existing group member's binary log.
- **Binary Log Row Format.**
  Set [`binlog_format=row`](replication-options-binary-log.md#sysvar_binlog_format).
  This setting is the default, so you do not need to specify
  it. Group Replication relies on the row-based replication
  format to propagate changes consistently among the servers
  in the group, and extract the necessary information to
  detect conflicts among transactions that execute
  concurrently in different servers in the group. From MySQL
  8.0.19, the `REQUIRE_ROW_FORMAT` setting
  is automatically added to Group Replication's channels to
  enforce the use of row-based replication when the
  transactions are applied. See
  [Section 19.2.1, “Replication Formats”](replication-formats.md "19.2.1 Replication Formats") and
  [Section 19.3.3, “Replication Privilege Checks”](replication-privilege-checks.md "19.3.3 Replication Privilege Checks").
- **Binary Log Checksums Off (to MySQL 8.0.20).**
  Up to and including MySQL 8.0.20, set
  [`binlog_checksum=NONE`](replication-options-binary-log.md#sysvar_binlog_checksum). In
  these releases, Group Replication cannot make use of
  checksums and does not support their presence in the
  binary log. From MySQL 8.0.21, Group Replication supports
  checksums, so group members may use the default setting
  [`binlog_checksum=CRC32`](replication-options-binary-log.md#sysvar_binlog_checksum),
  and you do not need to specify it.
- **Global Transaction Identifiers On.**
  Set [`gtid_mode=ON`](replication-options-gtids.md#sysvar_gtid_mode) and
  [`enforce_gtid_consistency=ON`](replication-options-gtids.md#sysvar_enforce_gtid_consistency).
  These settings are not the defaults. GTID-based
  replication is required for Group Replication, which uses
  global transaction identifiers to track the transactions
  that have been committed on every server instance in the
  group. See [Section 19.1.3, “Replication with Global Transaction Identifiers”](replication-gtids.md "19.1.3 Replication with Global Transaction Identifiers").

  In addition, if you need to set the value of
  [`gtid_purged`](replication-options-gtids.md#sysvar_gtid_purged), you must do so
  while Group Replication is not running.
- **Replication Information Repositories.**
  Set
  [`master_info_repository=TABLE`](replication-options-replica.md#sysvar_master_info_repository)
  and
  [`relay_log_info_repository=TABLE`](replication-options-replica.md#sysvar_relay_log_info_repository).
  In MySQL 8.0, these settings are the default, and the
  `FILE` setting is deprecated. From MySQL
  8.0.23, the use of these system variables is deprecated,
  so omit the system variables and just allow the default.
  The replication applier needs to have the replication
  metadata written to the
  `mysql.slave_master_info` and
  `mysql.slave_relay_log_info` system
  tables to ensure the Group Replication plugin has
  consistent recoverability and transactional management of
  the replication metadata. See
  [Section 19.2.4.2, “Replication Metadata Repositories”](replica-logs-status.md "19.2.4.2 Replication Metadata Repositories").
- **Transaction Write Set Extraction.**
  Set
  [`transaction_write_set_extraction=XXHASH64`](replication-options-binary-log.md#sysvar_transaction_write_set_extraction)
  so that while collecting rows to log them to the binary
  log, the server collects the write set as well. In MySQL
  8.0, this setting is the default, and from MySQL 8.0.26,
  the use of the system variable is deprecated. The write
  set is based on the primary keys of each row and is a
  simplified and compact view of a tag that uniquely
  identifies the row that was changed. Group Replication
  uses this information for conflict detection and
  certification on all group members.
- **Default Table Encryption.**
  Set
  [`default_table_encryption`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_default_table_encryption)
  to the same value on all group members. Default schema and
  tablespace encryption can be either enabled
  (`ON`) or disabled
  (`OFF`, the default) as long as the
  setting is the same on all members.

  The value of
  [`default_table_encryption`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_default_table_encryption)
  cannot be changed while Group Replication is running.
- **Lower Case Table Names.**
  Set
  [`lower_case_table_names`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_lower_case_table_names) to
  the same value on all group members. A setting of 1 is
  correct for the use of the
  [`InnoDB`](innodb-storage-engine.md "Chapter 17 The InnoDB Storage Engine") storage engine, which
  is required for Group Replication. Note that this setting
  is not the default on all platforms.
- **Binary Log Dependency Tracking.**
  Setting
  [`binlog_transaction_dependency_tracking`](replication-options-binary-log.md#sysvar_binlog_transaction_dependency_tracking)
  to `WRITESET` can improve performance for
  a group member, depending on the group's workload.
  While Group Replication carries out its own
  parallelization after certification when applying
  transactions from the relay log, independently of any
  value set for
  `binlog_transaction_dependency_tracking`,
  this value does affect how transactions are written to the
  binary logs on Group Replication members. The dependency
  information in those logs is used to assist the process of
  state transfer for distributed recovery from a
  donor's binary log, which takes place whenever a
  member joins or rejoins the group.

  Note

  When
  [`replica_preserve_commit_order`](replication-options-replica.md#sysvar_replica_preserve_commit_order)
  is `ON`, setting
  `binlog_transaction_dependency_tracking`
  to `WRITESET` has the same effect as
  setting it to `WRITESET_SESSION`.
- **Multithreaded Appliers.**
  Group Replication members can be configured as
  multithreaded replicas, enabling transactions to be
  applied in parallel. From MySQL 8.0.27, all replicas are
  configured as multithreaded by default. A nonzero value
  for the system variable
  [`replica_parallel_workers`](replication-options-replica.md#sysvar_replica_parallel_workers)
  (from MySQL 8.0.26) or
  [`slave_parallel_workers`](replication-options-replica.md#sysvar_slave_parallel_workers)
  (before MySQL 8.0.26) enables the multithreaded applier on
  the member. The default from MySQL 8.0.27 is 4 parallel
  applier threads, and up to 1024 parallel applier threads
  can be specified. For a multithreaded replica, the
  following settings are also required, which are the
  defaults from MySQL 8.0.27:

  [`replica_preserve_commit_order=ON`](replication-options-replica.md#sysvar_replica_preserve_commit_order) (from MySQL 8.0.26) or [`slave_preserve_commit_order=ON`](replication-options-replica.md#sysvar_slave_preserve_commit_order) (before MySQL 8.0.26)
  :   This setting is required to ensure that the final
      commit of parallel transactions is in the same order
      as the original transactions. Group Replication relies
      on consistency mechanisms built around the guarantee
      that all participating members receive and apply
      committed transactions in the same order.

  [`replica_parallel_type=LOGICAL_CLOCK`](replication-options-replica.md#sysvar_replica_parallel_type) (from MySQL 8.0.26) or [`slave_parallel_type=LOGICAL_CLOCK`](replication-options-replica.md#sysvar_slave_parallel_type) (before MySQL 8.0.26)
  :   This setting is required with
      [`replica_preserve_commit_order=ON`](replication-options-replica.md#sysvar_replica_preserve_commit_order)
      or
      [`slave_preserve_commit_order=ON`](replication-options-replica.md#sysvar_slave_preserve_commit_order).
      It specifies the policy used to decide which
      transactions are allowed to execute in parallel on the
      replica.

  Setting
  [`replica_parallel_workers=0`](replication-options-replica.md#sysvar_replica_parallel_workers)
  or [`slave_parallel_workers=0`](replication-options-replica.md#sysvar_slave_parallel_workers)
  disables parallel execution and gives the replica a single
  applier thread and no coordinator thread. With that setting,
  the [`replica_parallel_type`](replication-options-replica.md#sysvar_replica_parallel_type)
  or [`slave_parallel_type`](replication-options-replica.md#sysvar_slave_parallel_type) and
  [`replica_preserve_commit_order`](replication-options-replica.md#sysvar_replica_preserve_commit_order)
  or
  [`slave_preserve_commit_order`](replication-options-replica.md#sysvar_slave_preserve_commit_order)
  options have no effect and are ignored. From MySQL 8.0.27,
  if parallel execution is disabled when GTIDs are in use on a
  replica, the replica actually uses one parallel worker, to
  take advantage of the method for retrying transactions
  without accessing the file positions. However, this behavior
  does not change anything for the user.
- **Detached XA transactions.**
  MySQL 8.0.29 and later supports detached XA transactions.
  A detached transaction is one which, once prepared, is no
  longer connected to the current session. This happens
  automatically as part of executing
  [`XA
  PREPARE`](xa-statements.md "15.3.8.1 XA Transaction SQL Statements"). The prepared XA transaction can be
  committed or rolled back by another connection, and the
  current session can then initiate another XA transaction
  or local transaction without waiting for the transaction
  that was just prepared to complete.

  When detached XA transaction support is enabled
  ([`xa_detach_on_prepare = ON`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_xa_detach_on_prepare))
  it is possible for any connection to this server to list
  (using [`XA
  RECOVER`](xa-statements.md "15.3.8.1 XA Transaction SQL Statements")), roll back, or commit any prepared XA
  transaction. In addition, you cannot use temporary tables
  within detached XA transactions.

  You can disable support for detached XA transactions by
  setting
  [`xa_detach_on_prepare`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_xa_detach_on_prepare) to
  `OFF`, but this is not recommended. In
  particular, if this server is being set up as an instance in
  MySQL group replication, you should leave this variable set
  to its default value (`ON`).

  See [Section 15.3.8.2, “XA Transaction States”](xa-states.md "15.3.8.2 XA Transaction States"), for more information.
