### 2.8.10 Generating MySQL Doxygen Documentation Content

The MySQL source code contains internal documentation written
using Doxygen. The generated Doxygen content is available at
<https://dev.mysql.com/doc/index-other.html>. It is also possible to
generate this content locally from a MySQL source distribution
using the following procedure:

1. Install **doxygen** 1.9.2 or later.
   Distributions are available here at
   <http://www.doxygen.nl/>.

   After installing **doxygen**, verify the
   version number:

   ```terminal
   $> doxygen --version
   1.9.2
   ```
2. Install
   [PlantUML](http://plantuml.com/download.html).

   When you install PlantUML on Windows (tested on Windows 10),
   you must run it at least once as administrator so it creates
   the registry keys. Open an administrator console and run this
   command:

   ```terminal
   $> java -jar path-to-plantuml.jar
   ```

   The command should open a GUI window and return no errors on
   the console.
3. Set the `PLANTUML_JAR_PATH` environment to
   the location where you installed PlantUML. For example:

   ```terminal
   $> export PLANTUML_JAR_PATH=path-to-plantuml.jar
   ```
4. Install the
   [Graphviz](http://www.graphviz.org/)
   **dot** command.

   After installing Graphviz, verify **dot**
   availability. For example:

   ```terminal
   $> which dot
   /usr/bin/dot

   $> dot -V
   dot - graphviz version 2.40.1 (20161225.0304)
   ```
5. Change location to the top-level directory of your MySQL
   source distribution and do the following:

   First, execute **cmake**:

   ```terminal
   $> cd mysql-source-directory
   $> mkdir build
   $> cd build
   $> cmake ..
   ```

   Next, generate the **doxygen** documentation:

   ```terminal
   $> make doxygen
   ```

   Inspect the error log, which is available in the
   `doxyerror.log` file in the top-level
   directory. Assuming that the build executed successfully, view
   the generated output using a browser. For example:

   ```terminal
   $> firefox doxygen/html/index.html
   ```
