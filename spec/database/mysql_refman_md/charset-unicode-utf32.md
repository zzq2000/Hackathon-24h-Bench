### 12.9.7 The utf32 Character Set (UTF-32 Unicode Encoding)

The `utf32` character set is fixed length (like
`ucs2` and unlike `utf16`).
`utf32` uses 32 bits for every character,
unlike `ucs2` (which uses 16 bits for every
character), and unlike `utf16` (which uses 16
bits for some characters and 32 bits for others).

`utf32` takes twice as much space as
`ucs2` and more space than
`utf16`, but `utf32` has the
same advantage as `ucs2` that it is predictable
for storage: The required number of bytes for
`utf32` equals the number of characters times
4. Also, unlike `utf16`, there are no tricks
for encoding in `utf32`, so the stored value
equals the code value.

To demonstrate how the latter advantage is useful, here is an
example that shows how to determine a `utf8mb4`
value given the `utf32` code value:

```sql
/* Assume code value = 100cc LINEAR B WHEELED CHARIOT */
CREATE TABLE tmp (utf32_col CHAR(1) CHARACTER SET utf32,
                  utf8mb4_col CHAR(1) CHARACTER SET utf8mb4);
INSERT INTO tmp VALUES (0x000100cc,NULL);
UPDATE tmp SET utf8mb4_col = utf32_col;
SELECT HEX(utf32_col),HEX(utf8mb4_col) FROM tmp;
```

MySQL is very forgiving about additions of unassigned Unicode
characters or private-use-area characters. There is in fact only
one validity check for `utf32`: No code value
may be greater than `0x10ffff`. For example,
this is illegal:

```sql
INSERT INTO t (utf32_column) VALUES (0x110000); /* illegal */
```
