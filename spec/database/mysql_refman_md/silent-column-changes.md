#### 15.1.20.7 Silent Column Specification Changes

In some cases, MySQL silently changes column specifications from
those given in a [`CREATE TABLE`](create-table.md "15.1.20 CREATE TABLE Statement") or
[`ALTER TABLE`](alter-table.md "15.1.9 ALTER TABLE Statement") statement. These
might be changes to a data type, to attributes associated with a
data type, or to an index specification.

All changes are subject to the internal row-size limit of 65,535
bytes, which may cause some attempts at data type changes to
fail. See [Section 10.4.7, “Limits on Table Column Count and Row Size”](column-count-limit.md "10.4.7 Limits on Table Column Count and Row Size").

- Columns that are part of a `PRIMARY KEY`
  are made `NOT NULL` even if not declared
  that way.
- Trailing spaces are automatically deleted from
  [`ENUM`](enum.md "13.3.5 The ENUM Type") and
  [`SET`](set.md "13.3.6 The SET Type") member values when the
  table is created.
- MySQL maps certain data types used by other SQL database
  vendors to MySQL types. See
  [Section 13.9, “Using Data Types from Other Database Engines”](other-vendor-data-types.md "13.9 Using Data Types from Other Database Engines").
- If you include a `USING` clause to specify
  an index type that is not permitted for a given storage
  engine, but there is another index type available that the
  engine can use without affecting query results, the engine
  uses the available type.
- If strict SQL mode is not enabled, a
  [`VARCHAR`](char.md "13.3.2 The CHAR and VARCHAR Types") column with a length
  specification greater than 65535 is converted to
  [`TEXT`](blob.md "13.3.4 The BLOB and TEXT Types"), and a
  [`VARBINARY`](binary-varbinary.md "13.3.3 The BINARY and VARBINARY Types") column with a
  length specification greater than 65535 is converted to
  [`BLOB`](blob.md "13.3.4 The BLOB and TEXT Types"). Otherwise, an error
  occurs in either of these cases.
- Specifying the `CHARACTER SET binary`
  attribute for a character data type causes the column to be
  created as the corresponding binary data type:
  [`CHAR`](char.md "13.3.2 The CHAR and VARCHAR Types") becomes
  [`BINARY`](binary-varbinary.md "13.3.3 The BINARY and VARBINARY Types"),
  [`VARCHAR`](char.md "13.3.2 The CHAR and VARCHAR Types") becomes
  [`VARBINARY`](binary-varbinary.md "13.3.3 The BINARY and VARBINARY Types"), and
  [`TEXT`](blob.md "13.3.4 The BLOB and TEXT Types") becomes
  [`BLOB`](blob.md "13.3.4 The BLOB and TEXT Types"). For the
  [`ENUM`](enum.md "13.3.5 The ENUM Type") and
  [`SET`](set.md "13.3.6 The SET Type") data types, this does not
  occur; they are created as declared. Suppose that you
  specify a table using this definition:

  ```sql
  CREATE TABLE t
  (
    c1 VARCHAR(10) CHARACTER SET binary,
    c2 TEXT CHARACTER SET binary,
    c3 ENUM('a','b','c') CHARACTER SET binary
  );
  ```

  The resulting table has this definition:

  ```sql
  CREATE TABLE t
  (
    c1 VARBINARY(10),
    c2 BLOB,
    c3 ENUM('a','b','c') CHARACTER SET binary
  );
  ```

To see whether MySQL used a data type other than the one you
specified, issue a [`DESCRIBE`](describe.md "15.8.1 DESCRIBE Statement") or
[`SHOW CREATE TABLE`](show-create-table.md "15.7.7.10 SHOW CREATE TABLE Statement") statement after
creating or altering the table.

Certain other data type changes can occur if you compress a
table using [**myisampack**](myisampack.md "6.6.6 myisampack — Generate Compressed, Read-Only MyISAM Tables"). See
[Section 18.2.3.3, “Compressed Table Characteristics”](compressed-format.md "18.2.3.3 Compressed Table Characteristics").
