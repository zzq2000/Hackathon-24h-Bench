#### 6.2.2.1 Using Options on the Command Line

Program options specified on the command line follow these
rules:

- Options are given after the command name.
- An option argument begins with one dash or two dashes,
  depending on whether it is a short form or long form of the
  option name. Many options have both short and long forms.
  For example, `-?` and `--help`
  are the short and long forms of the option that instructs a
  MySQL program to display its help message.
- Option names are case-sensitive. `-v` and
  `-V` are both legal and have different
  meanings. (They are the corresponding short forms of the
  `--verbose` and `--version`
  options.)
- Some options take a value following the option name. For
  example, `-h localhost` or
  [`--host=localhost`](connection-options.md#option_general_host) indicate
  the MySQL server host to a client program. The option value
  tells the program the name of the host where the MySQL
  server is running.
- For a long option that takes a value, separate the option
  name and the value by an `=` sign. For a
  short option that takes a value, the option value can
  immediately follow the option letter, or there can be a
  space between: `-hlocalhost` and `-h
  localhost` are equivalent. An exception to this rule
  is the option for specifying your MySQL password. This
  option can be given in long form as
  [`--password=pass_val`](connection-options.md#option_general_password)
  or as [`--password`](connection-options.md#option_general_password). In the
  latter case (with no password value given), the program
  interactively prompts you for the password. The password
  option also may be given in short form as
  `-ppass_val` or as
  `-p`. However, for the short form, if the
  password value is given, it must follow the option letter
  with *no intervening space*: If a space
  follows the option letter, the program has no way to tell
  whether a following argument is supposed to be the password
  value or some other kind of argument. Consequently, the
  following two commands have two completely different
  meanings:

  ```terminal
  mysql -ptest
  mysql -p test
  ```

  The first command instructs [**mysql**](mysql.md "6.5.1 mysql — The MySQL Command-Line Client") to use
  a password value of `test`, but specifies
  no default database. The second instructs
  [**mysql**](mysql.md "6.5.1 mysql — The MySQL Command-Line Client") to prompt for the password value
  and to use `test` as the default database.
- Within option names, dash (`-`) and
  underscore (`_`) may be used
  interchangeably in most cases, although the leading dashes
  *cannot* be given as underscores. For
  example, [`--skip-grant-tables`](server-options.md#option_mysqld_skip-grant-tables)
  and
  [`--skip_grant_tables`](server-options.md#option_mysqld_skip-grant-tables)
  are equivalent.

  In this Manual, we use dashes in option names, except where
  underscores are significant. This is the case with, for
  example, [`--log-bin`](replication-options-binary-log.md#option_mysqld_log-bin) and
  [`--log_bin`](replication-options-binary-log.md#sysvar_log_bin), which are
  different options. We encourage you to do so as well.
- The MySQL server has certain command options that may be
  specified only at startup, and a set of system variables,
  some of which may be set at startup, at runtime, or both.
  System variable names use underscores rather than dashes,
  and when referenced at runtime (for example, using
  [`SET`](set-variable.md "15.7.6.1 SET Syntax for Variable Assignment")
  or [`SELECT`](select.md "15.2.13 SELECT Statement") statements), must
  be written using underscores:

  ```sql
  SET GLOBAL general_log = ON;
  SELECT @@GLOBAL.general_log;
  ```

  At server startup, the syntax for system variables is the
  same as for command options, so within variable names,
  dashes and underscores may be used interchangeably. For
  example, [`--general_log=ON`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_general_log) and
  [`--general-log=ON`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_general_log) are
  equivalent. (This is also true for system variables set
  within option files.)
- For options that take a numeric value, the value can be
  given with a suffix of `K`,
  `M`, or `G` to indicate a
  multiplier of 1024, 10242 or
  10243. As of MySQL 8.0.14, a
  suffix can also be `T`,
  `P`, and `E` to indicate a
  multiplier of 10244,
  10245 or
  10246. Suffix letters can be
  uppercase or lowercase.

  For example, the following command tells
  [**mysqladmin**](mysqladmin.md "6.5.2 mysqladmin — A MySQL Server Administration Program") to ping the server 1024 times,
  sleeping 10 seconds between each ping:

  ```terminal
  mysqladmin --count=1K --sleep=10 ping
  ```
- When specifying file names as option values, avoid the use
  of the `~` shell metacharacter. It might
  not be interpreted as you expect.

Option values that contain spaces must be quoted when given on
the command line. For example, the
[`--execute`](mysql-command-options.md#option_mysql_execute) (or `-e`)
option can be used with [**mysql**](mysql.md "6.5.1 mysql — The MySQL Command-Line Client") to pass one or
more semicolon-separated SQL statements to the server. When this
option is used, [**mysql**](mysql.md "6.5.1 mysql — The MySQL Command-Line Client") executes the statements
in the option value and exits. The statements must be enclosed
by quotation marks. For example:

```terminal
$> mysql -u root -p -e "SELECT VERSION();SELECT NOW()"
Enter password: ******
+------------+
| VERSION()  |
+------------+
| 8.0.19     |
+------------+
+---------------------+
| NOW()               |
+---------------------+
| 2019-09-03 10:36:48 |
+---------------------+
$>
```

Note

The long form ([`--execute`](mysql-command-options.md#option_mysql_execute)) is
followed by an equal sign (`=`).

To use quoted values within a statement, you must either escape
the inner quotation marks, or use a different type of quotation
marks within the statement from those used to quote the
statement itself. The capabilities of your command processor
dictate your choices for whether you can use single or double
quotation marks and the syntax for escaping quote characters.
For example, if your command processor supports quoting with
single or double quotation marks, you can use double quotation
marks around the statement, and single quotation marks for any
quoted values within the statement.
