#### 29.12.20.12 Status Variable Summary Tables

The Performance Schema makes status variable information
available in the tables described in
[Section 29.12.15, “Performance Schema Status Variable Tables”](performance-schema-status-variable-tables.md "29.12.15 Performance Schema Status Variable Tables").
It also makes aggregated status variable information available
in summary tables, described here. Each status variable
summary table has one or more grouping columns to indicate how
the table aggregates status values:

- [`status_by_account`](performance-schema-status-variable-summary-tables.md "29.12.20.12 Status Variable Summary Tables") has
  `USER`, `HOST`, and
  `VARIABLE_NAME` columns to summarize
  status variables by account.
- [`status_by_host`](performance-schema-status-variable-summary-tables.md "29.12.20.12 Status Variable Summary Tables") has
  `HOST` and
  `VARIABLE_NAME` columns to summarize
  status variables by the host from which clients connected.
- [`status_by_user`](performance-schema-status-variable-summary-tables.md "29.12.20.12 Status Variable Summary Tables") has
  `USER` and
  `VARIABLE_NAME` columns to summarize
  status variables by client user name.

Each status variable summary table has this summary column
containing aggregated values:

- `VARIABLE_VALUE`

  The aggregated status variable value for active and
  terminated sessions.

The status variable summary tables have these indexes:

- [`status_by_account`](performance-schema-status-variable-summary-tables.md "29.12.20.12 Status Variable Summary Tables"):

  - Primary key on (`USER`,
    `HOST`,
    `VARIABLE_NAME`)
- [`status_by_host`](performance-schema-status-variable-summary-tables.md "29.12.20.12 Status Variable Summary Tables"):

  - Primary key on (`HOST`,
    `VARIABLE_NAME`)
- [`status_by_user`](performance-schema-status-variable-summary-tables.md "29.12.20.12 Status Variable Summary Tables"):

  - Primary key on (`USER`,
    `VARIABLE_NAME`)

The meaning of “account” in these tables is
similar to its meaning in the MySQL grant tables in the
`mysql` system database, in the sense that
the term refers to a combination of user and host values. They
differ in that, for grant tables, the host part of an account
can be a pattern, whereas for Performance Schema tables, the
host value is always a specific nonpattern host name.

Account status is collected when sessions terminate. The
session status counters are added to the global status
counters and the corresponding account status counters. If
account statistics are not collected, the session status is
added to host and user status, if host and user status are
collected.

Account, host, and user statistics are not collected if the
[`performance_schema_accounts_size`](performance-schema-system-variables.md#sysvar_performance_schema_accounts_size),
[`performance_schema_hosts_size`](performance-schema-system-variables.md#sysvar_performance_schema_hosts_size),
and
[`performance_schema_users_size`](performance-schema-system-variables.md#sysvar_performance_schema_users_size)
system variables, respectively, are set to 0.

The Performance Schema supports [`TRUNCATE
TABLE`](truncate-table.md "15.1.37 TRUNCATE TABLE Statement") for status variable summary tables as follows;
in all cases, status for active sessions is unaffected:

- [`status_by_account`](performance-schema-status-variable-summary-tables.md "29.12.20.12 Status Variable Summary Tables"): Aggregates
  account status from terminated sessions to user and host
  status, then resets account status.
- [`status_by_host`](performance-schema-status-variable-summary-tables.md "29.12.20.12 Status Variable Summary Tables"): Resets
  aggregated host status from terminated sessions.
- [`status_by_user`](performance-schema-status-variable-summary-tables.md "29.12.20.12 Status Variable Summary Tables"): Resets
  aggregated user status from terminated sessions.

[`FLUSH STATUS`](flush.md#flush-status) adds the session
status from all active sessions to the global status
variables, resets the status of all active sessions, and
resets account, host, and user status values aggregated from
disconnected sessions.
