### 17.8.9 Purge Configuration

`InnoDB` does not physically remove a row from
the database immediately when you delete it with an SQL statement.
A row and its index records are only physically removed when
`InnoDB` discards the undo log record written for
the deletion. This removal operation, which only occurs after the
row is no longer required for multi-version concurrency control
(MVCC) or rollback, is called a purge.

Purge runs on a periodic schedule. It parses and processes undo
log pages from the history list, which is a list of undo log pages
for committed transactions that is maintained by the
`InnoDB` transaction system. Purge frees the undo
log pages from the history list after processing them.

#### Configuring Purge Threads

Purge operations are performed in the background by one or more
purge threads. The number of purge threads is controlled by the
[`innodb_purge_threads`](innodb-parameters.md#sysvar_innodb_purge_threads) variable.
The default value is 4.

If DML action is concentrated on a single table, purge operations
for the table are performed by a single purge thread, which can
result in slowed purge operations, increased purge lag, and
increased tablespace file size if the DML operations involve large
object values. From MySQL 8.0.26, if the
[`innodb_max_purge_lag`](innodb-parameters.md#sysvar_innodb_max_purge_lag) setting is
exceeded, purge work is automatically redistributed among
available purge threads. Too many active purge threads in this
scenario can cause contention with user threads, so manage the
[`innodb_purge_threads`](innodb-parameters.md#sysvar_innodb_purge_threads) setting
accordingly. The
[`innodb_max_purge_lag`](innodb-parameters.md#sysvar_innodb_max_purge_lag) variable is
set to 0 by default, which means that there is no maximum purge
lag by default.

If DML action is concentrated on few tables, keep the
[`innodb_purge_threads`](innodb-parameters.md#sysvar_innodb_purge_threads) setting low
so that the threads do not contend with each other for access to
the busy tables. If DML operations are spread across many tables,
consider a higher
[`innodb_purge_threads`](innodb-parameters.md#sysvar_innodb_purge_threads) setting. The
maximum number of purge threads is 32.

The [`innodb_purge_threads`](innodb-parameters.md#sysvar_innodb_purge_threads) setting
is the maximum number of purge threads permitted. The purge system
automatically adjusts the number of purge threads that are used.

#### Configuring Purge Batch Size

The [`innodb_purge_batch_size`](innodb-parameters.md#sysvar_innodb_purge_batch_size)
variable defines the number of undo log pages that purge parses
and processes in one batch from the history list. The default
value is 300. In a multithreaded purge configuration, the
coordinator purge thread divides
[`innodb_purge_batch_size`](innodb-parameters.md#sysvar_innodb_purge_batch_size) by
[`innodb_purge_threads`](innodb-parameters.md#sysvar_innodb_purge_threads) and assigns
that number of pages to each purge thread.

The purge system also frees the undo log pages that are no longer
required. It does so every 128 iterations through the undo logs.
In addition to defining the number of undo log pages parsed and
processed in a batch, the
[`innodb_purge_batch_size`](innodb-parameters.md#sysvar_innodb_purge_batch_size) variable
defines the number of undo log pages that purge frees every 128
iterations through the undo logs.

The [`innodb_purge_batch_size`](innodb-parameters.md#sysvar_innodb_purge_batch_size)
variable is intended for advanced performance tuning and
experimentation. Most users need not change
[`innodb_purge_batch_size`](innodb-parameters.md#sysvar_innodb_purge_batch_size) from its
default value.

#### Configuring the Maximum Purge Lag

The [`innodb_max_purge_lag`](innodb-parameters.md#sysvar_innodb_max_purge_lag) variable
defines the desired maximum purge lag. When the purge lag exceeds
the [`innodb_max_purge_lag`](innodb-parameters.md#sysvar_innodb_max_purge_lag)
threshold, a delay is imposed on
[`INSERT`](insert.md "15.2.7 INSERT Statement"),
[`UPDATE`](update.md "15.2.17 UPDATE Statement"), and
[`DELETE`](delete.md "15.2.2 DELETE Statement") operations to allow time for
purge operations to catch up. The default value is 0, which means
there is no maximum purge lag and no delay.

The `InnoDB` transaction system maintains a list
of transactions that have index records delete-marked by
[`UPDATE`](update.md "15.2.17 UPDATE Statement") or
[`DELETE`](delete.md "15.2.2 DELETE Statement") operations. The length of
the list is the purge lag. Prior to MySQL 8.0.14, the purge lag
delay is calculated by the following formula, which results in a
minimum delay of 5000 microseconds:

```none
(purge lag/innodb_max_purge_lag - 0.5) * 10000
```

As of MySQL 8.0.14, the purge lag delay is calculated by the
following revised formula, which reduces the minimum delay to 5
microseconds. A delay of 5 microseconds is more appropriate for
modern systems.

```none
(purge_lag/innodb_max_purge_lag - 0.9995) * 10000
```

The delay is calculated at the beginning of a purge batch.

A typical [`innodb_max_purge_lag`](innodb-parameters.md#sysvar_innodb_max_purge_lag)
setting for a problematic workload might be 1000000 (1 million),
assuming that transactions are small, only 100 bytes in size, and
it is permissible to have 100MB of unpurged table rows.

The purge lag is presented as the `History list
length` value in the `TRANSACTIONS`
section of [`SHOW
ENGINE INNODB STATUS`](show-engine.md "15.7.7.15 SHOW ENGINE Statement") output.

```terminal
mysql> SHOW ENGINE INNODB STATUS;
...
------------
TRANSACTIONS
------------
Trx id counter 0 290328385
Purge done for trx's n:o < 0 290315608 undo n:o < 0 17
History list length 20
```

The `History list length` is typically a low
value, usually less than a few thousand, but a write-heavy
workload or long running transactions can cause it to increase,
even for transactions that are read only. The reason that a long
running transaction can cause the `History list
length` to increase is that under a consistent read
transaction isolation level such as
`REPEATABLE READ`, a transaction
must return the same result as when the read view for that
transaction was created. Consequently, the
`InnoDB` multi-version concurrency control (MVCC)
system must keep a copy of the data in the undo log until all
transactions that depend on that data have completed. The
following are examples of long running transactions that could
cause the `History list length` to increase:

- A [**mysqldump**](mysqldump.md "6.5.4 mysqldump — A Database Backup Program") operation that uses the
  [`--single-transaction`](mysqldump.md#option_mysqldump_single-transaction) option
  while there is a significant amount of concurrent DML.
- Running a [`SELECT`](select.md "15.2.13 SELECT Statement") query after
  disabling [`autocommit`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_autocommit), and
  forgetting to issue an explicit `COMMIT` or
  `ROLLBACK`.

To prevent excessive delays in extreme situations where the purge
lag becomes huge, you can limit the delay by setting the
[`innodb_max_purge_lag_delay`](innodb-parameters.md#sysvar_innodb_max_purge_lag_delay)
variable. The
[`innodb_max_purge_lag_delay`](innodb-parameters.md#sysvar_innodb_max_purge_lag_delay)
variable specifies the maximum delay in microseconds for the delay
imposed when the
[`innodb_max_purge_lag`](innodb-parameters.md#sysvar_innodb_max_purge_lag) threshold is
exceeded. The specified
[`innodb_max_purge_lag_delay`](innodb-parameters.md#sysvar_innodb_max_purge_lag_delay) value
is an upper limit on the delay period calculated by the
[`innodb_max_purge_lag`](innodb-parameters.md#sysvar_innodb_max_purge_lag) formula.

#### Purge and Undo Tablespace Truncation

The purge system is also responsible for truncating undo
tablespaces. You can configure the
[`innodb_purge_rseg_truncate_frequency`](innodb-parameters.md#sysvar_innodb_purge_rseg_truncate_frequency)
variable to control the frequency with which the purge system
looks for undo tablespaces to truncate. For more information, see
[Truncating Undo Tablespaces](innodb-undo-tablespaces.md#truncate-undo-tablespace "Truncating Undo Tablespaces").
