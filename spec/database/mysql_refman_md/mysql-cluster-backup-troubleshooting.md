#### 25.6.8.4 NDB Cluster Backup Troubleshooting

If an error code is returned when issuing a backup request, the
most likely cause is insufficient memory or disk space. You
should check that there is enough memory allocated for the
backup.

Important

If you have set
[`BackupDataBufferSize`](mysql-cluster-ndbd-definition.md#ndbparam-ndbd-backupdatabuffersize)
and
[`BackupLogBufferSize`](mysql-cluster-ndbd-definition.md#ndbparam-ndbd-backuplogbuffersize)
and their sum is greater than 4MB, then you must also set
[`BackupMemory`](mysql-cluster-ndbd-definition.md#ndbparam-ndbd-backupmemory) as well.

You should also make sure that there is sufficient space on the
hard drive partition of the backup target.

[`NDB`](mysql-cluster.md "Chapter 25 MySQL NDB Cluster 8.0") does not support repeatable
reads, which can cause problems with the restoration process.
Although the backup process is “hot”, restoring an
NDB Cluster from backup is not a 100% “hot”
process. This is due to the fact that, for the duration of the
restore process, running transactions get nonrepeatable reads
from the restored data. This means that the state of the data is
inconsistent while the restore is in progress.
