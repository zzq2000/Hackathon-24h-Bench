### 12.3.3 Database Character Set and Collation

Every database has a database character set and a database
collation. The [`CREATE DATABASE`](create-database.md "15.1.12 CREATE DATABASE Statement")
and [`ALTER DATABASE`](alter-database.md "15.1.2 ALTER DATABASE Statement") statements
have optional clauses for specifying the database character set
and collation:

```sql
CREATE DATABASE db_name
    [[DEFAULT] CHARACTER SET charset_name]
    [[DEFAULT] COLLATE collation_name]

ALTER DATABASE db_name
    [[DEFAULT] CHARACTER SET charset_name]
    [[DEFAULT] COLLATE collation_name]
```

The keyword `SCHEMA` can be used instead of
`DATABASE`.

The `CHARACTER SET` and
`COLLATE` clauses make it possible to create
databases with different character sets and collations on the
same MySQL server.

Database options are stored in the data dictionary and can be
examined by checking the Information Schema
[`SCHEMATA`](information-schema-schemata-table.md "28.3.31 The INFORMATION_SCHEMA SCHEMATA Table") table.

Example:

```sql
CREATE DATABASE db_name CHARACTER SET latin1 COLLATE latin1_swedish_ci;
```

MySQL chooses the database character set and database collation
in the following manner:

- If both `CHARACTER SET
  charset_name` and
  `COLLATE
  collation_name` are
  specified, character set
  *`charset_name`* and collation
  *`collation_name`* are used.
- If `CHARACTER SET
  charset_name` is
  specified without `COLLATE`, character set
  *`charset_name`* and its default
  collation are used. To see the default collation for each
  character set, use the [`SHOW CHARACTER
  SET`](show-character-set.md "15.7.7.3 SHOW CHARACTER SET Statement") statement or query the
  `INFORMATION_SCHEMA`
  [`CHARACTER_SETS`](information-schema-character-sets-table.md "28.3.4 The INFORMATION_SCHEMA CHARACTER_SETS Table") table.
- If `COLLATE
  collation_name` is
  specified without `CHARACTER SET`, the
  character set associated with
  *`collation_name`* and collation
  *`collation_name`* are used.
- Otherwise (neither `CHARACTER SET` nor
  `COLLATE` is specified), the server
  character set and server collation are used.

The character set and collation for the default database can be
determined from the values of the
[`character_set_database`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_character_set_database) and
[`collation_database`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_collation_database) system
variables. The server sets these variables whenever the default
database changes. If there is no default database, the variables
have the same value as the corresponding server-level system
variables, [`character_set_server`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_character_set_server)
and [`collation_server`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_collation_server).

To see the default character set and collation for a given
database, use these statements:

```sql
USE db_name;
SELECT @@character_set_database, @@collation_database;
```

Alternatively, to display the values without changing the
default database:

```sql
SELECT DEFAULT_CHARACTER_SET_NAME, DEFAULT_COLLATION_NAME
FROM INFORMATION_SCHEMA.SCHEMATA WHERE SCHEMA_NAME = 'db_name';
```

The database character set and collation affect these aspects of
server operation:

- For [`CREATE TABLE`](create-table.md "15.1.20 CREATE TABLE Statement") statements,
  the database character set and collation are used as default
  values for table definitions if the table character set and
  collation are not specified. To override this, provide
  explicit `CHARACTER SET` and
  `COLLATE` table options.
- For [`LOAD DATA`](load-data.md "15.2.9 LOAD DATA Statement") statements that
  include no `CHARACTER SET` clause, the
  server uses the character set indicated by the
  [`character_set_database`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_character_set_database)
  system variable to interpret the information in the file. To
  override this, provide an explicit `CHARACTER
  SET` clause.
- For stored routines (procedures and functions), the database
  character set and collation in effect at routine creation
  time are used as the character set and collation of
  character data parameters for which the declaration includes
  no `CHARACTER SET` or a
  `COLLATE` attribute. To override this,
  provide `CHARACTER SET` and
  `COLLATE` explicitly.
