### 7.1.3 Server Configuration Validation

As of MySQL 8.0.16, MySQL Server supports a
[`--validate-config`](server-options.md#option_mysqld_validate-config) option that
enables the startup configuration to be checked for problems
without running the server in normal operational mode:

```terminal
mysqld --validate-config
```

If no errors are found, the server terminates with an exit code of
0. If an error is found, the server displays a diagnostic message
and terminates with an exit code of 1. For example:

```terminal
$> mysqld --validate-config --no-such-option
2018-11-05T17:50:12.738919Z 0 [ERROR] [MY-000068] [Server] unknown
option '--no-such-option'.
2018-11-05T17:50:12.738962Z 0 [ERROR] [MY-010119] [Server] Aborting
```

The server terminates as soon as any error is found. For
additional checks to occur, correct the initial problem and run
the server with [`--validate-config`](server-options.md#option_mysqld_validate-config)
again.

For the preceding example, where use of
[`--validate-config`](server-options.md#option_mysqld_validate-config) results in
display of an error message, the server exit code is 1. Warning
and information messages may also be displayed, depending on the
[`log_error_verbosity`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_log_error_verbosity) value, but do
not produce immediate validation termination or an exit code of 1.
For example, this command produces multiple warnings, both of
which are displayed. But no error occurs, so the exit code is 0:

```terminal
$> mysqld --validate-config --log_error_verbosity=2
         --read-only=s --transaction_read_only=s
2018-11-05T15:43:18.445863Z 0 [Warning] [MY-000076] [Server] option
'read_only': boolean value 's' was not recognized. Set to OFF.
2018-11-05T15:43:18.445882Z 0 [Warning] [MY-000076] [Server] option
'transaction-read-only': boolean value 's' was not recognized. Set to OFF.
```

This command produces the same warnings, but also an error, so the
error message is displayed along with the warnings and the exit
code is 1:

```terminal
$> mysqld --validate-config --log_error_verbosity=2
         --no-such-option --read-only=s --transaction_read_only=s
2018-11-05T15:43:53.152886Z 0 [Warning] [MY-000076] [Server] option
'read_only': boolean value 's' was not recognized. Set to OFF.
2018-11-05T15:43:53.152913Z 0 [Warning] [MY-000076] [Server] option
'transaction-read-only': boolean value 's' was not recognized. Set to OFF.
2018-11-05T15:43:53.164889Z 0 [ERROR] [MY-000068] [Server] unknown
option '--no-such-option'.
2018-11-05T15:43:53.165053Z 0 [ERROR] [MY-010119] [Server] Aborting
```

The scope of the [`--validate-config`](server-options.md#option_mysqld_validate-config)
option is limited to configuration checking that the server can
perform without undergoing its normal startup process. As such,
the configuration check does not initialize storage engines and
other plugins, components, and so forth, and does not validate
options associated with those uninitialized subsystems.

[`--validate-config`](server-options.md#option_mysqld_validate-config) can be used any
time, but is particularly useful after an upgrade, to check
whether any options previously used with the older server are
considered by the upgraded server to be deprecated or obsolete.
For example, the `tx_read_only` system variable
was deprecated in MySQL 5.7 and removed in 8.0. Suppose that a
MySQL 5.7 server was run using that system variable in its
`my.cnf` file and then upgraded to MySQL 8.0.
Running the upgraded server with
[`--validate-config`](server-options.md#option_mysqld_validate-config) to check the
configuration produces this result:

```terminal
$> mysqld --validate-config
2018-11-05T10:40:02.712141Z 0 [ERROR] [MY-000067] [Server] unknown variable
'tx_read_only=ON'.
2018-11-05T10:40:02.712178Z 0 [ERROR] [MY-010119] [Server] Aborting
```

[`--validate-config`](server-options.md#option_mysqld_validate-config) can be used with
the [`--defaults-file`](option-file-options.md#option_general_defaults-file) option to
validate only the options in a specific file:

```terminal
$> mysqld --defaults-file=./my.cnf-test --validate-config
2018-11-05T10:40:02.712141Z 0 [ERROR] [MY-000067] [Server] unknown variable
'tx_read_only=ON'.
2018-11-05T10:40:02.712178Z 0 [ERROR] [MY-010119] [Server] Aborting
```

Remember that [`--defaults-file`](option-file-options.md#option_general_defaults-file), if
specified, must be the first option on the command line.
(Executing the preceding example with the option order reversed
produces a message that
[`--defaults-file`](option-file-options.md#option_general_defaults-file) itself is
unknown.)
