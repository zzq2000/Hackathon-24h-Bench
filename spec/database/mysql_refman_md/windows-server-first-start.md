#### 2.3.4.5 Starting the Server for the First Time

This section gives a general overview of starting the MySQL
server. The following sections provide more specific information
for starting the MySQL server from the command line or as a
Windows service.

The information here applies primarily if you installed MySQL
using the `noinstall` version, or if you wish
to configure and test MySQL manually rather than with the MySQL Installer.

The examples in these sections assume that MySQL is installed
under the default location of `C:\Program
Files\MySQL\MySQL Server 8.0`. Adjust the
path names shown in the examples if you have MySQL installed in
a different location.

Clients have two options. They can use TCP/IP, or they can use a
named pipe if the server supports named-pipe connections.

MySQL for Windows also supports shared-memory connections if the
server is started with the
[`shared_memory`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_shared_memory) system variable
enabled. Clients can connect through shared memory by using the
[`--protocol=MEMORY`](connection-options.md#option_general_protocol) option.

For information about which server binary to run, see
[Section 2.3.4.3, “Selecting a MySQL Server Type”](windows-select-server.md "2.3.4.3 Selecting a MySQL Server Type").

Testing is best done from a command prompt in a console window
(or “DOS window”). In this way you can have the
server display status messages in the window where they are easy
to see. If something is wrong with your configuration, these
messages make it easier for you to identify and fix any
problems.

Note

The database must be initialized before MySQL can be started.
For additional information about the initialization process,
see [Section 2.9.1, “Initializing the Data Directory”](data-directory-initialization.md "2.9.1 Initializing the Data Directory").

To start the server, enter this command:

```terminal
C:\> "C:\Program Files\MySQL\MySQL Server 8.0\bin\mysqld" --console
```

You should see messages similar to those following as it starts
(the path names and sizes may differ). The `ready for
connections` messages indicate that the server is ready
to service client connections.

```none
[Server] C:\mysql\bin\mysqld.exe (mysqld 8.0.30) starting as process 21236
[InnoDB] InnoDB initialization has started.
[InnoDB] InnoDB initialization has ended.
[Server] CA certificate ca.pem is self signed.
[Server] Channel mysql_main configured to support TLS.
Encrypted connections are now supported for this channel.
[Server] X Plugin ready for connections. Bind-address: '::' port: 33060
[Server] C:\mysql\bin\mysqld.exe: ready for connections.
Version: '8.0.30'  socket: ''  port: 3306  MySQL Community Server - GPL.
```

You can now open a new console window in which to run client
programs.

If you omit the [`--console`](server-options.md#option_mysqld_console) option,
the server writes diagnostic output to the error log in the data
directory (`C:\Program Files\MySQL\MySQL Server
8.0\data` by default). The error log is
the file with the `.err` extension, and may
be set using the [`--log-error`](server-options.md#option_mysqld_log-error)
option.

Note

The initial `root` account in the MySQL grant
tables has no password. After starting the server, you should
set up a password for it using the instructions in
[Section 2.9.4, “Securing the Initial MySQL Account”](default-privileges.md "2.9.4 Securing the Initial MySQL Account").
