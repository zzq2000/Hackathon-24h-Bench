#### 29.12.11.13 The replication\_group\_configuration\_version Table

This table displays the version of the member actions
configuration for replication group members. The table is
available only when Group Replication is installed. Whenever a
member action is enabled or disabled using the
[`group_replication_enable_member_action()`](group-replication-functions-for-member-actions.md#function_group-replication-enable-member-action)
and
[`group_replication_disable_member_action()`](group-replication-functions-for-member-actions.md#function_group-replication-disable-member-action)
functions, the version number is incremented. You can reset
the member actions configuration using the
[`group_replication_reset_member_actions()`](group-replication-functions-for-member-actions.md#function_group-replication-reset-member-actions)
function, which resets the member actions configuration to the
default settings, and resets its version number to 1. For more
information, see
[Section 20.5.1.5, “Configuring Member Actions”](group-replication-member-actions.md "20.5.1.5 Configuring Member Actions").

The `replication_group_configuration_version`
table has these columns:

- `NAME`

  The name of the configuration.
- `VERSION`

  The version number of the configuration.

The `replication_group_configuration_version`
table has no indexes.

[`TRUNCATE TABLE`](truncate-table.md "15.1.37 TRUNCATE TABLE Statement") is not permitted
for the
`replication_group_configuration_version`
table.
