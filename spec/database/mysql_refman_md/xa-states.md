#### 15.3.8.2 XA Transaction States

An XA transaction progresses through the following states:

1. Use [`XA
   START`](xa-statements.md "15.3.8.1 XA Transaction SQL Statements") to start an XA transaction and put it in the
   `ACTIVE` state.
2. For an `ACTIVE` XA transaction, issue the
   SQL statements that make up the transaction, and then issue
   an [`XA
   END`](xa-statements.md "15.3.8.1 XA Transaction SQL Statements") statement.
   [`XA
   END`](xa-statements.md "15.3.8.1 XA Transaction SQL Statements") puts the transaction in the
   `IDLE` state.
3. For an `IDLE` XA transaction, you can issue
   either an [`XA
   PREPARE`](xa-statements.md "15.3.8.1 XA Transaction SQL Statements") statement or an `XA COMMIT ... ONE
   PHASE` statement:

   - [`XA
     PREPARE`](xa-statements.md "15.3.8.1 XA Transaction SQL Statements") puts the transaction in the
     `PREPARED` state. An
     [`XA
     RECOVER`](xa-statements.md "15.3.8.1 XA Transaction SQL Statements") statement at this point includes the
     transaction's *`xid`* value
     in its output, because
     [`XA
     RECOVER`](xa-statements.md "15.3.8.1 XA Transaction SQL Statements") lists all XA transactions that are in
     the `PREPARED` state.
   - `XA COMMIT ... ONE PHASE` prepares and
     commits the transaction. The
     *`xid`* value is not listed by
     [`XA
     RECOVER`](xa-statements.md "15.3.8.1 XA Transaction SQL Statements") because the transaction terminates.
4. For a `PREPARED` XA transaction, you can
   issue an [`XA
   COMMIT`](xa-statements.md "15.3.8.1 XA Transaction SQL Statements") statement to commit and terminate the
   transaction, or
   [`XA
   ROLLBACK`](xa-statements.md "15.3.8.1 XA Transaction SQL Statements") to roll back and terminate the
   transaction.

Here is a simple XA transaction that inserts a row into a table
as part of a global transaction:

```sql
mysql> XA START 'xatest';
Query OK, 0 rows affected (0.00 sec)

mysql> INSERT INTO mytable (i) VALUES(10);
Query OK, 1 row affected (0.04 sec)

mysql> XA END 'xatest';
Query OK, 0 rows affected (0.00 sec)

mysql> XA PREPARE 'xatest';
Query OK, 0 rows affected (0.00 sec)

mysql> XA COMMIT 'xatest';
Query OK, 0 rows affected (0.00 sec)
```

In MySQL 8.0.28 and earlier, within the context of a given
client connection, XA transactions and local (non-XA)
transactions are mutually exclusive. For example, if
[`XA
START`](xa-statements.md "15.3.8.1 XA Transaction SQL Statements") has been issued to begin an XA transaction, a
local transaction cannot be started until the XA transaction has
been committed or rolled back. Conversely, if a local
transaction has been started with
[`START
TRANSACTION`](commit.md "15.3.1 START TRANSACTION, COMMIT, and ROLLBACK Statements"), no XA statements can be used until the
transaction has been committed or rolled back.

MySQL 8.0.29 and later supports detached XA transactions,
enabled by the
[`xa_detach_on_prepare`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_xa_detach_on_prepare) system
variable (`ON` by default). Detached
transactions are disconnected from the current session following
execution of [`XA
PREPARE`](xa-statements.md "15.3.8.1 XA Transaction SQL Statements") (and can be committed or rolled back by
another connection). This means that the current session is free
to start a new local transaction or XA transaction without
having to wait for the prepared XA transaction to be committed
or rolled back.

When XA transactions are detached, a connection has no special
knowledge of any XA transaction that it has prepared. If the
current session tries to commit or roll back a given XA
transaction (even one which it prepared) after another
connection has already done so, the attempt is rejected with an
invalid XID error ([`ER_XAER_NOTA`](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/mysql-errors/8.0/en/server-error-reference.html#error_er_xaer_nota))
since the requested *`xid`* no longer
exists.

Note

Detached XA transactions cannot use temporary tables.

When detached XA transactions are disabled
(`xa_detach_on_prepare` set to
`OFF`), an XA transaction remains connected
until it is committed or rolled back by the originating
connection, as described previously for MySQL 8.0.28 and
earlier. Disabling detached XA transactions is not recommended
for a MySQL server instance used in group replication; see
[Server Instance Configuration](group-replication-requirements.md#group-replication-configuration "Server Instance Configuration"), for more
information.

If an XA transaction is in the `ACTIVE` state,
you cannot issue any statements that cause an implicit commit.
That would violate the XA contract because you could not roll
back the XA transaction. Trying to execute such a statement
raises the following error:

```none
ERROR 1399 (XAE07): XAER_RMFAIL: The command cannot be executed
when global transaction is in the ACTIVE state
```

Statements to which the preceding remark applies are listed at
[Section 15.3.3, “Statements That Cause an Implicit Commit”](implicit-commit.md "15.3.3 Statements That Cause an Implicit Commit").
