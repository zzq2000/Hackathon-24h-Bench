# Chapter 24 InnoDB ReplicaSet

This chapter introduces MySQL InnoDB ReplicaSet, which combines
MySQL technologies to enable you to deploy and administer
[Chapter 19, *Replication*](replication.md "Chapter 19 Replication"). This content is a high-level overview
of InnoDB ReplicaSet, for full documentation, see
[MySQL InnoDB ReplicaSet](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/mysql-shell/8.0/en/mysql-innodb-replicaset.html).

An InnoDB ReplicaSet consists of at least two MySQL Server
instances, and it provides all of the MySQL Replication features you
are familiar with, such as read scale-out and data security.
InnoDB ReplicaSet uses the following MySQL technologies:

- [MySQL Shell](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/mysql-shell/8.0/en/), which is an
  advanced client and code editor for MySQL.
- MySQL Server, and [Chapter 19, *Replication*](replication.md "Chapter 19 Replication"), which enables a
  set of MySQL instances to provide availability and asynchronous
  read scale-out. InnoDB ReplicaSet provides an alternative,
  easy to use programmatic way to work with Replication.
- [MySQL Router](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/mysql-router/8.0/en/), a lightweight
  middleware that provides transparent routing between your
  application and InnoDB ReplicaSet.

The interface to an InnoDB ReplicaSet is similar to
[MySQL InnoDB Cluster](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/mysql-shell/8.0/en/mysql-innodb-cluster.html), you use MySQL Shell to work
with MySQL Server instances as a ReplicaSet, and MySQL Router is also
tightly integrated in the same way as InnoDB Cluster.

Being based on MySQL Replication, an InnoDB ReplicaSet has a
single primary, which replicates to one or more secondary instances.
An InnoDB ReplicaSet does not provide all of the features which
InnoDB Cluster provides, such as automatic failover, or
multi-primary mode. But, it does support features such as
configuring, adding, and removing instances in a similar way. You
can manually switch over or fail over to a secondary instance, for
example in the event of a failure. You can even adopt an existing
Replication deployment and then administer it as an
InnoDB ReplicaSet.

You work with InnoDB ReplicaSet using the
[AdminAPI](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/mysql-shell/8.0/en/admin-api-overview.html), provided as
part of MySQL Shell. AdminAPI is available in JavaScript and
Python, and is well suited to scripting and automation of
deployments of MySQL to achieve high-availability and scalability.
By using MySQL Shell's AdminAPI, you can avoid the need to
configure many instances manually. Instead, AdminAPI provides an
effective modern interface to sets of MySQL instances and enables
you to provision, administer, and monitor your deployment from one
central tool.

To get started with InnoDB ReplicaSet you need to
[download](https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/shell/)
and [install](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/mysql-shell/8.0/en/mysql-shell-install.html) MySQL Shell.
You need some hosts with MySQL Server instances
[installed](installing.md "Chapter 2 Installing MySQL"), and you can also
[install](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/mysql-router/8.0/en/mysql-router-installation.html) MySQL Router.

InnoDB ReplicaSet supports [MySQL
Clone](clone-plugin.md "7.6.7 The Clone Plugin"), which enables you to provision instances simply. In
the past, to provision a new instance before it joined a MySQL
Replication deployment, you would need to somehow manually transfer
the transactions to the joining instance. This could involve making
file copies, manually copying them, and so on. You can simply
[add an instance](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/mysql-shell/8.0/en/add-instance-replicaset.html) to
the replica set and it is automatically provisioned.

Similarly, InnoDB ReplicaSet is tightly integrated with
[MySQL Router](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/mysql-router/8.0/en/), and you can use
AdminAPI to [work with](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/mysql-shell/8.0/en/registered-routers.html)
them together. MySQL Router can automatically configure itself based on
an InnoDB ReplicaSet, in a process called
[bootstrapping](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/mysql-shell/8.0/en/admin-api-bootstrapping-router.html),
which removes the need for you to configure routing manually.
MySQL Router then transparently connects client applications to the
InnoDB ReplicaSet, providing routing and load-balancing for client
connections. This integration also enables you to administer some
aspects of a MySQL Router bootstrapped against an InnoDB ReplicaSet
using AdminAPI. InnoDB ReplicaSet status information includes
details about MySQL Routers bootstrapped against the ReplicaSet.
Operations enable you to
[create MySQL Router users](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/mysql-shell/8.0/en/configuring-router-user.html)
at the ReplicaSet level, to work with the MySQL Routers bootstrapped
against the ReplicaSet, and so on.

For more information on these technologies, see the user
documentation linked in the descriptions. In addition to this user
documentation, there is developer documentation for all AdminAPI
methods in the MySQL Shell JavaScript API Reference or MySQL Shell
Python API Reference, available from
[Connectors and APIs](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/index-connectors.html).
