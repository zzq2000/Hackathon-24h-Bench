#### 8.4.4.18 Keyring Command Options

MySQL supports the following keyring-related command-line
options:

- [`--keyring-migration-destination=plugin`](keyring-options.md#option_mysqld_keyring-migration-destination)

  |  |  |
  | --- | --- |
  | Command-Line Format | `--keyring-migration-destination=plugin_name` |
  | Type | String |

  The destination keyring plugin for key migration. See
  [Section 8.4.4.14, “Migrating Keys Between Keyring Keystores”](keyring-key-migration.md "8.4.4.14 Migrating Keys Between Keyring Keystores"). The option value
  interpretation depends on whether
  [`--keyring-migration-to-component`](keyring-options.md#option_mysqld_keyring-migration-to-component)
  is specified:

  - If no, the option value is a keyring plugin, interpreted
    the same way as for
    [`--keyring-migration-source`](keyring-options.md#option_mysqld_keyring-migration-source).
  - If yes, the option value is a keyring component,
    specified as the component library name in the plugin
    directory, including any platform-specific extension
    such as `.so` or
    `.dll`.

  Note

  [`--keyring-migration-source`](keyring-options.md#option_mysqld_keyring-migration-source)
  and
  [`--keyring-migration-destination`](keyring-options.md#option_mysqld_keyring-migration-destination)
  are mandatory for all keyring migration operations. The
  source and destination plugins must differ, and the
  migration server must support both plugins.
- [`--keyring-migration-host=host_name`](keyring-options.md#option_mysqld_keyring-migration-host)

  |  |  |
  | --- | --- |
  | Command-Line Format | `--keyring-migration-host=host_name` |
  | Type | String |
  | Default Value | `localhost` |

  The host location of the running server that is currently
  using one of the key migration keystores. See
  [Section 8.4.4.14, “Migrating Keys Between Keyring Keystores”](keyring-key-migration.md "8.4.4.14 Migrating Keys Between Keyring Keystores"). Migration always
  occurs on the local host, so the option always specifies a
  value for connecting to a local server, such as
  `localhost`, `127.0.0.1`,
  `::1`, or the local host IP address or host
  name.
- [`--keyring-migration-password[=password]`](keyring-options.md#option_mysqld_keyring-migration-password)

  |  |  |
  | --- | --- |
  | Command-Line Format | `--keyring-migration-password[=password]` |
  | Type | String |

  The password of the MySQL account used for connecting to the
  running server that is currently using one of the key
  migration keystores. See
  [Section 8.4.4.14, “Migrating Keys Between Keyring Keystores”](keyring-key-migration.md "8.4.4.14 Migrating Keys Between Keyring Keystores").

  The password value is optional. If not given, the server
  prompts for one. If given, there must be *no
  space* between
  [`--keyring-migration-password=`](keyring-options.md#option_mysqld_keyring-migration-password)
  and the password following it. If no password option is
  specified, the default is to send no password.

  Specifying a password on the command line should be
  considered insecure. See
  [Section 8.1.2.1, “End-User Guidelines for Password Security”](password-security-user.md "8.1.2.1 End-User Guidelines for Password Security"). You can use an
  option file to avoid giving the password on the command
  line. In this case, the file should have a restrictive mode
  and be accessible only to the account used to run the
  migration server.
- [`--keyring-migration-port=port_num`](keyring-options.md#option_mysqld_keyring-migration-port)

  |  |  |
  | --- | --- |
  | Command-Line Format | `--keyring-migration-port=port_num` |
  | Type | Numeric |
  | Default Value | `3306` |

  For TCP/IP connections, the port number for connecting to
  the running server that is currently using one of the key
  migration keystores. See
  [Section 8.4.4.14, “Migrating Keys Between Keyring Keystores”](keyring-key-migration.md "8.4.4.14 Migrating Keys Between Keyring Keystores").
- [`--keyring-migration-socket=path`](keyring-options.md#option_mysqld_keyring-migration-socket)

  |  |  |
  | --- | --- |
  | Command-Line Format | `--keyring-migration-socket={file_name|pipe_name}` |
  | Type | String |

  For Unix socket file or Windows named pipe connections, the
  socket file or named pipe for connecting to the running
  server that is currently using one of the key migration
  keystores. See [Section 8.4.4.14, “Migrating Keys Between Keyring Keystores”](keyring-key-migration.md "8.4.4.14 Migrating Keys Between Keyring Keystores").
- [`--keyring-migration-source=plugin`](keyring-options.md#option_mysqld_keyring-migration-source)

  |  |  |
  | --- | --- |
  | Command-Line Format | `--keyring-migration-source=plugin_name` |
  | Type | String |

  The source keyring plugin for key migration. See
  [Section 8.4.4.14, “Migrating Keys Between Keyring Keystores”](keyring-key-migration.md "8.4.4.14 Migrating Keys Between Keyring Keystores").

  The option value is similar to that for
  [`--plugin-load`](server-options.md#option_mysqld_plugin-load), except that
  only one plugin library can be specified. The value is given
  as *`plugin_library`* or
  *`name`*`=`*`plugin_library`*,
  where *`plugin_library`* is the name
  of a library file that contains plugin code, and
  *`name`* is the name of a plugin to
  load. If a plugin library is named without any preceding
  plugin name, the server loads all plugins in the library.
  With a preceding plugin name, the server loads only the
  named plugin from the library. The server looks for plugin
  library files in the directory named by the
  [`plugin_dir`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_plugin_dir) system variable.

  Note

  [`--keyring-migration-source`](keyring-options.md#option_mysqld_keyring-migration-source)
  and
  [`--keyring-migration-destination`](keyring-options.md#option_mysqld_keyring-migration-destination)
  are mandatory for all keyring migration operations. The
  source and destination plugins must differ, and the
  migration server must support both plugins.
- [`--keyring-migration-to-component`](keyring-options.md#option_mysqld_keyring-migration-to-component)

  |  |  |
  | --- | --- |
  | Command-Line Format | `--keyring-migration-to-component[={OFF|ON}]` |
  | Introduced | 8.0.24 |
  | Type | Boolean |
  | Default Value | `OFF` |

  Indicates that a key migration is from a keyring plugin to a
  keyring component. This option makes it possible to migrate
  keys from any keyring plugin to any keyring component, which
  facilitates transitioning a MySQL installation from keyring
  plugins to keyring components.

  For key migration from one keyring component to another, use
  the [**mysql\_migrate\_keyring**](mysql-migrate-keyring.md "6.6.8 mysql_migrate_keyring — Keyring Key Migration Utility") utility.
  Migration from a keyring component to a keyring plugin is
  not supported. See [Section 8.4.4.14, “Migrating Keys Between Keyring Keystores”](keyring-key-migration.md "8.4.4.14 Migrating Keys Between Keyring Keystores").
- [`--keyring-migration-user=user_name`](keyring-options.md#option_mysqld_keyring-migration-user)

  |  |  |
  | --- | --- |
  | Command-Line Format | `--keyring-migration-user=user_name` |
  | Type | String |

  The user name of the MySQL account used for connecting to
  the running server that is currently using one of the key
  migration keystores. See
  [Section 8.4.4.14, “Migrating Keys Between Keyring Keystores”](keyring-key-migration.md "8.4.4.14 Migrating Keys Between Keyring Keystores").
