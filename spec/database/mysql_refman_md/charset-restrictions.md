## 12.11 Restrictions on Character Sets

- Identifiers are stored in `mysql` database
  tables (`user`, `db`, and so
  forth) using `utf8mb3`, but identifiers can
  contain only characters in the Basic Multilingual Plane (BMP).
  Supplementary characters are not permitted in identifiers.
- The `ucs2`, `utf16`,
  `utf16le`, and `utf32`
  character sets have the following restrictions:

  - None of them can be used as the client character set. See
    [Impermissible Client Character Sets](charset-connection.md#charset-connection-impermissible-client-charset "Impermissible Client Character Sets").
  - It is currently not possible to use
    [`LOAD DATA`](load-data.md "15.2.9 LOAD DATA Statement") to load data
    files that use these character sets.
  - `FULLTEXT` indexes cannot be created on a
    column that uses any of these character sets. However, you
    can perform `IN BOOLEAN MODE` searches on
    the column without an index.
- The [`REGEXP`](regexp.md#operator_regexp) and
  [`RLIKE`](regexp.md#operator_regexp)
  operators work in byte-wise fashion, so they are not multibyte
  safe and may produce unexpected results with multibyte
  character sets. In addition, these operators compare
  characters by their byte values and accented characters may
  not compare as equal even if a given collation treats them as
  equal.
