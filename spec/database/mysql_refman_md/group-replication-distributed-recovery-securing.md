### 20.6.3 Securing Distributed Recovery Connections

[20.6.3.1 Secure User Credentials for Distributed Recovery](group-replication-secure-user.md)

[20.6.3.2 Secure Socket Layer (SSL) Connections for Distributed Recovery](group-replication-configuring-ssl-for-recovery.md)

Important

When using the MySQL communication stack
([`group_replication_communication_stack=MYSQL`](group-replication-system-variables.md#sysvar_group_replication_communication_stack))
AND secure connections between members
([`group_replication_ssl_mode`](group-replication-system-variables.md#sysvar_group_replication_ssl_mode) is
not set to `DISABLED`), the security settings
discussed in this section are applied not just to distributed
recovery connections, but to group communications between
members in general.

When a member joins the group, distributed recovery is carried out
using a combination of a remote cloning operation, if available
and appropriate, and an asynchronous replication connection. For a
full description of distributed recovery, see
[Section 20.5.4, “Distributed Recovery”](group-replication-distributed-recovery.md "20.5.4 Distributed Recovery").

Up to MySQL 8.0.20, group members offer their standard SQL client
connection to joining members for distributed recovery, as
specified by MySQL Server's
[`hostname`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_hostname) and
[`port`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_port) system variables. From MySQL
8.0.21, group members may advertise an alternative list of
distributed recovery endpoints as dedicated client connections for
joining members. For more details, see
[Section 20.5.4.1, “Connections for Distributed Recovery”](group-replication-distributed-recovery-connections.md "20.5.4.1 Connections for Distributed Recovery").
Notice that such connections offered to a joining member for
distributed recovery is *not* the same
connections that are used by Group Replication for communication
between online members when the XCom communication stack is used
for group communications
([`group_replication_communication_stack=XCOM`](group-replication-system-variables.md#sysvar_group_replication_communication_stack)).

To secure distributed recovery connections in the group, ensure
that user credentials for the replication user are properly
secured, and use SSL for distributed recovery connections if
possible.
