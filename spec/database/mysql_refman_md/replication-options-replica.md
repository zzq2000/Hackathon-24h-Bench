#### 19.1.6.3 Replica Server Options and Variables

This section explains the server options and system variables that
apply to replica servers and contains the following:

- [Startup Options for Replica Servers](replication-options-replica.md#replication-optvars-slaves "Startup Options for Replica Servers")
- [System Variables Used on Replica Servers](replication-options-replica.md#replication-sysvars-slaves "System Variables Used on Replica Servers")

Specify the options either on the
[command line](command-line-options.md "6.2.2.1 Using Options on the Command Line") or in an
[option file](option-files.md "6.2.2.2 Using Option Files"). Many of the
options can be set while the server is running by using the
[`CHANGE REPLICATION SOURCE TO`](change-replication-source-to.md "15.4.2.3 CHANGE REPLICATION SOURCE TO Statement")
statement (from MySQL 8.0.23) or [`CHANGE
MASTER TO`](change-master-to.md "15.4.2.1 CHANGE MASTER TO Statement") statement (before MySQL 8.0.23). Specify
system variable values using
[`SET`](set-variable.md "15.7.6.1 SET Syntax for Variable Assignment").

**Server ID.**
On the source and each replica, you must set the
[`server_id`](replication-options.md#sysvar_server_id) system variable to
establish a unique replication ID in the range from 1 to
232 − 1. “Unique”
means that each ID must be different from every other ID in use
by any other source or replica in the replication topology.
Example `my.cnf` file:

```ini
[mysqld]
server-id=3
```

##### Startup Options for Replica Servers

This section explains startup options for controlling replica
servers. Many of these options can be set while the server is
running by using the [`CHANGE REPLICATION
SOURCE TO`](change-replication-source-to.md "15.4.2.3 CHANGE REPLICATION SOURCE TO Statement") statement (from MySQL 8.0.23) or
[`CHANGE MASTER TO`](change-master-to.md "15.4.2.1 CHANGE MASTER TO Statement") statement
(before MySQL 8.0.23). Others, such as the
`--replicate-*` options, can be set only when the
replica server starts. Replication-related system variables are
discussed later in this section.

- [`--master-info-file=file_name`](replication-options-replica.md#option_mysqld_master-info-file)

  |  |  |
  | --- | --- |
  | Command-Line Format | `--master-info-file=file_name` |
  | Deprecated | 8.0.18 |
  | Type | File name |
  | Default Value | `master.info` |

  The use of this option is now deprecated. It was used to set
  the file name for the replica's connection metadata
  repository if
  [`master_info_repository=FILE`](replication-options-replica.md#sysvar_master_info_repository)
  was set. [`--master-info-file`](replication-options-replica.md#option_mysqld_master-info-file)
  and the use of the
  [`master_info_repository`](replication-options-replica.md#sysvar_master_info_repository)
  system variable are deprecated because the use of a file for
  the connection metadata repository has been superseded by
  crash-safe tables. For information about the connection
  metadata repository, see
  [Section 19.2.4.2, “Replication Metadata Repositories”](replica-logs-status.md "19.2.4.2 Replication Metadata Repositories").
- [`--master-retry-count=count`](replication-options-replica.md#option_mysqld_master-retry-count)

  |  |  |
  | --- | --- |
  | Command-Line Format | `--master-retry-count=#` |
  | Deprecated | Yes |
  | Type | Integer |
  | Default Value | `86400` |
  | Minimum Value | `0` |
  | Maximum Value (64-bit platforms) | `18446744073709551615` |
  | Maximum Value (32-bit platforms) | `4294967295` |

  The number of times that the replica tries to reconnect to
  the source before giving up. The default value is 86400
  times. A value of 0 means “infinite”, and the
  replica attempts to connect forever. Reconnection attempts
  are triggered when the replica reaches its connection
  timeout (specified by the
  [`replica_net_timeout`](replication-options-replica.md#sysvar_replica_net_timeout) or
  [`slave_net_timeout`](replication-options-replica.md#sysvar_slave_net_timeout) system
  variable) without receiving data or a heartbeat signal from
  the source. Reconnection is attempted at intervals set by
  the `SOURCE_CONNECT_RETRY` |
  `MASTER_CONNECT_RETRY` option of the
  [`CHANGE REPLICATION SOURCE TO`](change-replication-source-to.md "15.4.2.3 CHANGE REPLICATION SOURCE TO Statement")
  | [`CHANGE MASTER TO`](change-master-to.md "15.4.2.1 CHANGE MASTER TO Statement") statement
  (which defaults to every 60 seconds).

  This option is deprecated; expect it to be removed in a
  future MySQL release. Use the
  `SOURCE_RETRY_COUNT` |
  `MASTER_RETRY_COUNT` option of the
  [`CHANGE REPLICATION SOURCE TO`](change-replication-source-to.md "15.4.2.3 CHANGE REPLICATION SOURCE TO Statement")
  | [`CHANGE MASTER TO`](change-master-to.md "15.4.2.1 CHANGE MASTER TO Statement") statement
  instead.
- [`--max-relay-log-size=size`](replication-options-replica.md#option_mysqld_max-relay-log-size)

  |  |  |
  | --- | --- |
  | Command-Line Format | `--max-relay-log-size=#` |
  | System Variable | `max_relay_log_size` |
  | Scope | Global |
  | Dynamic | Yes |
  | [`SET_VAR`](optimizer-hints.md#optimizer-hints-set-var "Variable-Setting Hint Syntax") Hint Applies | No |
  | Type | Integer |
  | Default Value | `0` |
  | Minimum Value | `0` |
  | Maximum Value | `1073741824` |
  | Unit | bytes |
  | [Block Size](server-system-variables.md#system-variables-block-size "Note") | `4096` |

  The size at which the server rotates relay log files
  automatically. If this value is nonzero, the relay log is
  rotated automatically when its size exceeds this value. If
  this value is zero (the default), the size at which relay
  log rotation occurs is determined by the value of
  [`max_binlog_size`](replication-options-binary-log.md#sysvar_max_binlog_size). For more
  information, see [Section 19.2.4.1, “The Relay Log”](replica-logs-relaylog.md "19.2.4.1 The Relay Log").
- [`--relay-log-purge={0|1}`](replication-options-replica.md#option_mysqld_relay-log-purge)

  |  |  |
  | --- | --- |
  | Command-Line Format | `--relay-log-purge[={OFF|ON}]` |
  | System Variable | `relay_log_purge` |
  | Scope | Global |
  | Dynamic | Yes |
  | [`SET_VAR`](optimizer-hints.md#optimizer-hints-set-var "Variable-Setting Hint Syntax") Hint Applies | No |
  | Type | Boolean |
  | Default Value | `ON` |

  Disable or enable automatic purging of relay logs as soon as
  they are no longer needed. The default value is 1 (enabled).
  This is a global variable that can be changed dynamically
  with `SET GLOBAL relay_log_purge =
  N`. Disabling purging of
  relay logs when enabling the
  [`--relay-log-recovery`](replication-options-replica.md#sysvar_relay_log_recovery) option
  risks data consistency and is therefore not crash-safe.
- [`--relay-log-space-limit=size`](replication-options-replica.md#option_mysqld_relay-log-space-limit)

  |  |  |
  | --- | --- |
  | Command-Line Format | `--relay-log-space-limit=#` |
  | System Variable | `relay_log_space_limit` |
  | Scope | Global |
  | Dynamic | No |
  | [`SET_VAR`](optimizer-hints.md#optimizer-hints-set-var "Variable-Setting Hint Syntax") Hint Applies | No |
  | Type | Integer |
  | Default Value | `0` |
  | Minimum Value | `0` |
  | Maximum Value | `18446744073709551615` |
  | Unit | bytes |

  This option places an upper limit on the total size in bytes
  of all relay logs on the replica. A value of 0 means
  “no limit”. This is useful for a replica server
  host that has limited disk space. When the limit is reached,
  the I/O (receiver) thread stops reading binary log events
  from the source server until the SQL thread has caught up
  and deleted some unused relay logs. Note that this limit is
  not absolute: There are cases where the SQL (applier) thread
  needs more events before it can delete relay logs. In that
  case, the receiver thread exceeds the limit until it becomes
  possible for the applier thread to delete some relay logs
  because not doing so would cause a deadlock. You should not
  set [`--relay-log-space-limit`](replication-options-replica.md#option_mysqld_relay-log-space-limit)
  to less than twice the value of
  [`--max-relay-log-size`](replication-options-replica.md#option_mysqld_max-relay-log-size) (or
  [`--max-binlog-size`](replication-options-binary-log.md#sysvar_max_binlog_size) if
  [`--max-relay-log-size`](replication-options-replica.md#option_mysqld_max-relay-log-size) is 0).
  In that case, there is a chance that the receiver thread
  waits for free space because
  [`--relay-log-space-limit`](replication-options-replica.md#option_mysqld_relay-log-space-limit) is
  exceeded, but the applier thread has no relay log to purge
  and is unable to satisfy the receiver thread. This forces
  the receiver thread to ignore
  [`--relay-log-space-limit`](replication-options-replica.md#option_mysqld_relay-log-space-limit)
  temporarily.
- [`--replicate-do-db=db_name`](replication-options-replica.md#option_mysqld_replicate-do-db)

  |  |  |
  | --- | --- |
  | Command-Line Format | `--replicate-do-db=name` |
  | Type | String |

  Creates a replication filter using the name of a database.
  Such filters can also be created using
  [`CHANGE
  REPLICATION FILTER REPLICATE_DO_DB`](change-replication-filter.md "15.4.2.2 CHANGE REPLICATION FILTER Statement").

  This option supports channel specific replication filters,
  enabling multi-source replicas to use specific filters for
  different sources. To configure a channel specific
  replication filter on a channel named
  *`channel_1`* use
  `--replicate-do-db:channel_1:db_name`.
  In this case, the first colon is interpreted as a separator
  and subsequent colons are literal colons. See
  [Section 19.2.5.4, “Replication Channel Based Filters”](replication-rules-channel-based-filters.md "19.2.5.4 Replication Channel Based Filters")
  for more information.

  Note

  Global replication filters cannot be used on a MySQL
  server instance that is configured for Group
  Replication, because filtering transactions on some
  servers would make the group unable to reach agreement
  on a consistent state. Channel specific replication
  filters can be used on replication channels that are not
  directly involved with Group Replication, such as where
  a group member also acts as a replica to a source that
  is outside the group. They cannot be used on the
  `group_replication_applier` or
  `group_replication_recovery` channels.

  The precise effect of this replication filter depends on
  whether statement-based or row-based replication is in use.

  **Statement-based replication.**
  Tell the replication SQL thread to restrict replication to
  statements where the default database (that is, the one
  selected by [`USE`](use.md "15.8.4 USE Statement")) is
  *`db_name`*. To specify more than
  one database, use this option multiple times, once for
  each database; however, doing so does
  *not* replicate cross-database
  statements such as `UPDATE
  some_db.some_table SET
  foo='bar'` while a different database (or no
  database) is selected.

  Warning

  To specify multiple databases you
  *must* use multiple instances of this
  option. Because database names can contain commas, if you
  supply a comma separated list then the list is treated as
  the name of a single database.

  An example of what does not work as you might expect when
  using statement-based replication: If the replica is started
  with [`--replicate-do-db=sales`](replication-options-replica.md#option_mysqld_replicate-do-db)
  and you issue the following statements on the source, the
  [`UPDATE`](update.md "15.2.17 UPDATE Statement") statement is
  *not* replicated:

  ```sql
  USE prices;
  UPDATE sales.january SET amount=amount+1000;
  ```

  The main reason for this “check just the default
  database” behavior is that it is difficult from the
  statement alone to know whether it should be replicated (for
  example, if you are using multiple-table
  [`DELETE`](delete.md "15.2.2 DELETE Statement") statements or
  multiple-table [`UPDATE`](update.md "15.2.17 UPDATE Statement")
  statements that act across multiple databases). It is also
  faster to check only the default database rather than all
  databases if there is no need.

  **Row-based replication.**
  Tells the replication SQL thread to restrict replication
  to database *`db_name`*. Only
  tables belonging to *`db_name`* are
  changed; the current database has no effect on this.
  Suppose that the replica is started with
  [`--replicate-do-db=sales`](replication-options-replica.md#option_mysqld_replicate-do-db) and
  row-based replication is in effect, and then the following
  statements are run on the source:

  ```sql
  USE prices;
  UPDATE sales.february SET amount=amount+100;
  ```

  The `february` table in the
  `sales` database on the replica is changed
  in accordance with the [`UPDATE`](update.md "15.2.17 UPDATE Statement")
  statement; this occurs whether or not the
  [`USE`](use.md "15.8.4 USE Statement") statement was issued.
  However, issuing the following statements on the source has
  no effect on the replica when using row-based replication
  and [`--replicate-do-db=sales`](replication-options-replica.md#option_mysqld_replicate-do-db):

  ```sql
  USE prices;
  UPDATE prices.march SET amount=amount-25;
  ```

  Even if the statement `USE prices` were
  changed to `USE sales`, the
  [`UPDATE`](update.md "15.2.17 UPDATE Statement") statement's
  effects would still not be replicated.

  Another important difference in how
  [`--replicate-do-db`](replication-options-replica.md#option_mysqld_replicate-do-db) is handled
  in statement-based replication as opposed to row-based
  replication occurs with regard to statements that refer to
  multiple databases. Suppose that the replica is started with
  [`--replicate-do-db=db1`](replication-options-replica.md#option_mysqld_replicate-do-db), and
  the following statements are executed on the source:

  ```sql
  USE db1;
  UPDATE db1.table1, db2.table2 SET db1.table1.col1 = 10, db2.table2.col2 = 20;
  ```

  If you are using statement-based replication, then both
  tables are updated on the replica. However, when using
  row-based replication, only `table1` is
  affected on the replica; since `table2` is
  in a different database, `table2` on the
  replica is not changed by the
  [`UPDATE`](update.md "15.2.17 UPDATE Statement"). Now suppose that,
  instead of the `USE db1` statement, a
  `USE db4` statement had been used:

  ```sql
  USE db4;
  UPDATE db1.table1, db2.table2 SET db1.table1.col1 = 10, db2.table2.col2 = 20;
  ```

  In this case, the [`UPDATE`](update.md "15.2.17 UPDATE Statement")
  statement would have no effect on the replica when using
  statement-based replication. However, if you are using
  row-based replication, the
  [`UPDATE`](update.md "15.2.17 UPDATE Statement") would change
  `table1` on the replica, but not
  `table2`—in other words, only tables
  in the database named by
  [`--replicate-do-db`](replication-options-replica.md#option_mysqld_replicate-do-db) are
  changed, and the choice of default database has no effect on
  this behavior.

  If you need cross-database updates to work, use
  [`--replicate-wild-do-table=db_name.%`](replication-options-replica.md#option_mysqld_replicate-wild-do-table)
  instead. See [Section 19.2.5, “How Servers Evaluate Replication Filtering Rules”](replication-rules.md "19.2.5 How Servers Evaluate Replication Filtering Rules").

  Note

  This option affects replication in the same manner that
  [`--binlog-do-db`](replication-options-binary-log.md#option_mysqld_binlog-do-db) affects
  binary logging, and the effects of the replication format
  on how [`--replicate-do-db`](replication-options-replica.md#option_mysqld_replicate-do-db)
  affects replication behavior are the same as those of the
  logging format on the behavior of
  [`--binlog-do-db`](replication-options-binary-log.md#option_mysqld_binlog-do-db).

  This option has no effect on
  [`BEGIN`](commit.md "15.3.1 START TRANSACTION, COMMIT, and ROLLBACK Statements"),
  [`COMMIT`](commit.md "15.3.1 START TRANSACTION, COMMIT, and ROLLBACK Statements"), or
  [`ROLLBACK`](commit.md "15.3.1 START TRANSACTION, COMMIT, and ROLLBACK Statements")
  statements.
- [`--replicate-ignore-db=db_name`](replication-options-replica.md#option_mysqld_replicate-ignore-db)

  |  |  |
  | --- | --- |
  | Command-Line Format | `--replicate-ignore-db=name` |
  | Type | String |

  Creates a replication filter using the name of a database.
  Such filters can also be created using
  [`CHANGE
  REPLICATION FILTER REPLICATE_IGNORE_DB`](change-replication-filter.md "15.4.2.2 CHANGE REPLICATION FILTER Statement").

  This option supports channel specific replication filters,
  enabling multi-source replicas to use specific filters for
  different sources. To configure a channel specific
  replication filter on a channel named
  *`channel_1`* use
  `--replicate-ignore-db:channel_1:db_name`.
  In this case, the first colon is interpreted as a separator
  and subsequent colons are literal colons. See
  [Section 19.2.5.4, “Replication Channel Based Filters”](replication-rules-channel-based-filters.md "19.2.5.4 Replication Channel Based Filters")
  for more information.

  Note

  Global replication filters cannot be used on a MySQL
  server instance that is configured for Group
  Replication, because filtering transactions on some
  servers would make the group unable to reach agreement
  on a consistent state. Channel specific replication
  filters can be used on replication channels that are not
  directly involved with Group Replication, such as where
  a group member also acts as a replica to a source that
  is outside the group. They cannot be used on the
  `group_replication_applier` or
  `group_replication_recovery` channels.

  To specify more than one database to ignore, use this option
  multiple times, once for each database. Because database
  names can contain commas, if you supply a comma-separated
  list, it is treated as the name of a single database.

  As with [`--replicate-do-db`](replication-options-replica.md#option_mysqld_replicate-do-db),
  the precise effect of this filtering depends on whether
  statement-based or row-based replication is in use, and are
  described in the next several paragraphs.

  **Statement-based replication.**
  Tells the replication SQL thread not to replicate any
  statement where the default database (that is, the one
  selected by [`USE`](use.md "15.8.4 USE Statement")) is
  *`db_name`*.

  **Row-based replication.**
  Tells the replication SQL thread not to update any tables
  in the database *`db_name`*. The
  default database has no effect.

  When using statement-based replication, the following
  example does not work as you might expect. Suppose that the
  replica is started with
  [`--replicate-ignore-db=sales`](replication-options-replica.md#option_mysqld_replicate-ignore-db)
  and you issue the following statements on the source:

  ```sql
  USE prices;
  UPDATE sales.january SET amount=amount+1000;
  ```

  The [`UPDATE`](update.md "15.2.17 UPDATE Statement") statement
  *is* replicated in such a case because
  [`--replicate-ignore-db`](replication-options-replica.md#option_mysqld_replicate-ignore-db) applies
  only to the default database (determined by the
  [`USE`](use.md "15.8.4 USE Statement") statement). Because the
  `sales` database was specified explicitly
  in the statement, the statement has not been filtered.
  However, when using row-based replication, the
  [`UPDATE`](update.md "15.2.17 UPDATE Statement") statement's
  effects are *not* propagated to the
  replica, and the replica's copy of the
  `sales.january` table is unchanged; in this
  instance,
  [`--replicate-ignore-db=sales`](replication-options-replica.md#option_mysqld_replicate-ignore-db)
  causes *all* changes made to tables in
  the source's copy of the `sales`
  database to be ignored by the replica.

  You should not use this option if you are using
  cross-database updates and you do not want these updates to
  be replicated. See [Section 19.2.5, “How Servers Evaluate Replication Filtering Rules”](replication-rules.md "19.2.5 How Servers Evaluate Replication Filtering Rules").

  If you need cross-database updates to work, use
  [`--replicate-wild-ignore-table=db_name.%`](replication-options-replica.md#option_mysqld_replicate-wild-ignore-table)
  instead. See [Section 19.2.5, “How Servers Evaluate Replication Filtering Rules”](replication-rules.md "19.2.5 How Servers Evaluate Replication Filtering Rules").

  Note

  This option affects replication in the same manner that
  [`--binlog-ignore-db`](replication-options-binary-log.md#option_mysqld_binlog-ignore-db) affects
  binary logging, and the effects of the replication format
  on how
  [`--replicate-ignore-db`](replication-options-replica.md#option_mysqld_replicate-ignore-db)
  affects replication behavior are the same as those of the
  logging format on the behavior of
  [`--binlog-ignore-db`](replication-options-binary-log.md#option_mysqld_binlog-ignore-db).

  This option has no effect on
  [`BEGIN`](commit.md "15.3.1 START TRANSACTION, COMMIT, and ROLLBACK Statements"),
  [`COMMIT`](commit.md "15.3.1 START TRANSACTION, COMMIT, and ROLLBACK Statements"), or
  [`ROLLBACK`](commit.md "15.3.1 START TRANSACTION, COMMIT, and ROLLBACK Statements")
  statements.

  | Command-Line Format | `--replicate-do-table=name` |
  | Type | String |

  Creates a replication filter by telling the replication SQL
  thread to restrict replication to a given table. To specify
  more than one table, use this option multiple times, once
  for each table. This works for both cross-database updates
  and default database updates, in contrast to
  [`--replicate-do-db`](replication-options-replica.md#option_mysqld_replicate-do-db). See
  [Section 19.2.5, “How Servers Evaluate Replication Filtering Rules”](replication-rules.md "19.2.5 How Servers Evaluate Replication Filtering Rules"). You can also create
  such a filter by issuing a
  [`CHANGE
  REPLICATION FILTER REPLICATE_DO_TABLE`](change-replication-filter.md "15.4.2.2 CHANGE REPLICATION FILTER Statement") statement.

  This option supports channel specific replication filters,
  enabling multi-source replicas to use specific filters for
  different sources. To configure a channel specific
  replication filter on a channel named
  *`channel_1`* use
  `--replicate-do-table:channel_1:db_name.tbl_name`.
  In this case, the first colon is interpreted as a separator
  and subsequent colons are literal colons. See
  [Section 19.2.5.4, “Replication Channel Based Filters”](replication-rules-channel-based-filters.md "19.2.5.4 Replication Channel Based Filters")

  This option affects only statements that apply to tables. It
  does not affect statements that apply only to other database
  objects, such as stored routines. To filter statements
  operating on stored routines, use one or more of the
  `--replicate-*-db` options.

  [`ALTER DATABASE`](alter-database.md "15.1.2 ALTER DATABASE Statement").

  To specify multiple rewrites, use this option multiple
  times. The server uses the first one with a
  *`from_name`* value that matches. The
  database name translation is done
  *before* the
  `--replicate-*` rules are tested. You can
  also create such a filter by issuing a
  [`CHANGE
  REPLICATION FILTER REPLICATE_REWRITE_DB`](change-replication-filter.md "15.4.2.2 CHANGE REPLICATION FILTER Statement") statement.

  If you use the
  [`--replicate-rewrite-db`](replication-options-replica.md#option_mysqld_replicate-rewrite-db) option
  on the command line and the `>`
  character is special to your command interpreter, quote the
  option value. For example:

  ```terminal
  $> mysqld --replicate-rewrite-db="olddb->newdb"
  ```

  The effect of the
  [`--replicate-rewrite-db`](replication-options-replica.md#option_mysqld_replicate-rewrite-db) option
  differs depending on whether statement-based or row-based
  binary logging format is used for the query. With
  statement-based format, DML statements are translated based
  on the current database, as specified by the
  [`USE`](use.md "15.8.4 USE Statement") statement. With row-based
  format, DML statements are translated based on the database
  where the modified table exists. DDL statements are always
  filtered based on the current database, as specified by the
  [`USE`](use.md "15.8.4 USE Statement") statement, regardless of
  the binary logging format.

  To ensure that rewriting produces the expected results,
  particularly in combination with other replication filtering
  options, follow these recommendations when you use the
  [`--replicate-rewrite-db`](replication-options-replica.md#option_mysqld_replicate-rewrite-db)
  option:

  - Create the *`from_name`* and
    *`to_name`* databases manually on
    the source and the replica with different names.
  - If you use statement-based or mixed binary logging
    format, do not use cross-database queries, and do not
    specify database names in queries. For both DDL and DML
    statements, rely on the
    [`USE`](use.md "15.8.4 USE Statement") statement to specify
    the current database, and use only the table name in
    queries.
  - If you use row-based binary logging format exclusively,
    for DDL statements, rely on the
    [`USE`](use.md "15.8.4 USE Statement") statement to specify
    the current database, and use only the table name in
    queries. For DML statements, you can use a fully
    qualified table name
    (*`db`*.*`table`*)
    if you want.

  If these recommendations are followed, it is safe to use the
  [`--replicate-rewrite-db`](replication-options-replica.md#option_mysqld_replicate-rewrite-db) option
  in combination with table-level replication filtering
  options such as
  [`--replicate-do-table`](replication-options-replica.md#option_mysqld_replicate-do-table).

  This option supports channel specific replication filters,
  enabling multi-source replicas to use specific filters for
  different sources. Specify the channel name followed by a
  colon, followed by the filter specification. The first colon
  is interpreted as a separator, and any subsequent colons are
  interpreted as literal colons. For example, to configure a
  channel specific replication filter on a channel named
  *`channel_1`*, use:

  ```terminal
  $> mysqld --replicate-rewrite-db=channel_1:db_name1->db_name2
  ```

  If you use a colon but do not specify a channel name, the
  option configures the replication filter for the default
  replication channel. See
  [Section 19.2.5.4, “Replication Channel Based Filters”](replication-rules-channel-based-filters.md "19.2.5.4 Replication Channel Based Filters")
  for more information.

  Note

  Global replication filters cannot be used on a MySQL
  server instance that is configured for Group
  Replication, because filtering transactions on some
  servers would make the group unable to reach agreement
  on a consistent state. Channel specific replication
  filters can be used on replication channels that are not
  directly involved with Group Replication, such as where
  a group member also acts as a replica to a source that
  is outside the group. They cannot be used on the
  `group_replication_applier` or
  `group_replication_recovery` channels.
- [`--replicate-same-server-id`](replication-options-replica.md#option_mysqld_replicate-same-server-id)

  |  |  |
  | --- | --- |
  | Command-Line Format | `--replicate-same-server-id[={OFF|ON}]` |
  | Type | Boolean |
  | Default Value | `OFF` |

  This option is for use on replicas. The default is 0
  (`FALSE`). With this option set to 1
  (`TRUE`), the replica does not skip events
  that have its own server ID. This setting is normally useful
  only in rare configurations.

  When binary logging is enabled on a replica, the combination
  of the
  [`--replicate-same-server-id`](replication-options-replica.md#option_mysqld_replicate-same-server-id)
  and [`--log-slave-updates`](replication-options-binary-log.md#sysvar_log_slave_updates)
  options on the replica can cause infinite loops in
  replication if the server is part of a circular replication
  topology. (In MySQL 8.0, binary logging is enabled by
  default, and replica update logging is the default when
  binary logging is enabled.) However, the use of global
  transaction identifiers (GTIDs) prevents this situation by
  skipping the execution of transactions that have already
  been applied. If
  [`gtid_mode=ON`](replication-options-gtids.md#sysvar_gtid_mode) is set on the
  replica, you can start the server with this combination of
  options, but you cannot change to any other GTID mode while
  the server is running. If any other GTID mode is set, the
  server does not start with this combination of options.

  By default, the replication I/O (receiver) thread does not
  write binary log events to the relay log if they have the
  replica's server ID (this optimization helps save disk
  usage). If you want to use
  [`--replicate-same-server-id`](replication-options-replica.md#option_mysqld_replicate-same-server-id),
  be sure to start the replica with this option before you
  make the replica read its own events that you want the
  replication SQL (applier) thread to execute.
- [`--replicate-wild-do-table=db_name.tbl_name`](replication-options-replica.md#option_mysqld_replicate-wild-do-table)

  |  |  |
  | --- | --- |
  | Command-Line Format | `--replicate-wild-do-table=name` |
  | Type | String |

  Creates a replication filter by telling the replication SQL
  (applier) thread to restrict replication to statements where
  any of the updated tables match the specified database and
  table name patterns. Patterns can contain the
  `%` and `_` wildcard
  characters, which have the same meaning as for the
  [`LIKE`](string-comparison-functions.md#operator_like) pattern-matching operator.
  To specify more than one table, use this option multiple
  times, once for each table. This works for cross-database
  updates. See [Section 19.2.5, “How Servers Evaluate Replication Filtering Rules”](replication-rules.md "19.2.5 How Servers Evaluate Replication Filtering Rules"). You can
  also create such a filter by issuing a
  [`CHANGE
  REPLICATION FILTER REPLICATE_WILD_DO_TABLE`](change-replication-filter.md "15.4.2.2 CHANGE REPLICATION FILTER Statement")
  statement.

  This option supports channel specific replication filters,
  enabling multi-source replicas to use specific filters for
  different sources. To configure a channel specific
  replication filter on a channel named
  *`channel_1`* use
  `--replicate-wild-do-table:channel_1:db_name.tbl_name`.
  In this case, the first colon is interpreted as a separator
  and subsequent colons are literal colons. See
  [Section 19.2.5.4, “Replication Channel Based Filters”](replication-rules-channel-based-filters.md "19.2.5.4 Replication Channel Based Filters")
  for more information.

  Important

  Global replication filters cannot be used on a MySQL
  server instance that is configured for Group Replication,
  because filtering transactions on some servers would make
  the group unable to reach agreement on a consistent state.
  Channel specific replication filters can be used on
  replication channels that are not directly involved with
  Group Replication, such as where a group member also acts
  as a replica to a source that is outside the group. They
  cannot be used on the
  `group_replication_applier` or
  `group_replication_recovery` channels.

  The replication filter specified by the
  [`--replicate-wild-do-table`](replication-options-replica.md#option_mysqld_replicate-wild-do-table)
  option applies to tables, views, and triggers. It does not
  apply to stored procedures and functions, or events. To
  filter statements operating on the latter objects, use one
  or more of the `--replicate-*-db` options.

  As an example,
  [`--replicate-wild-do-table=foo%.bar%`](replication-options-replica.md#option_mysqld_replicate-wild-do-table)
  replicates only updates that use a table where the database
  name starts with `foo` and the table name
  starts with `bar`.

  If the table name pattern is `%`, it
  matches any table name and the option also applies to
  database-level statements ([`CREATE
  DATABASE`](create-database.md "15.1.12 CREATE DATABASE Statement"), [`DROP
  DATABASE`](drop-database.md "15.1.24 DROP DATABASE Statement"), and [`ALTER
  DATABASE`](alter-database.md "15.1.2 ALTER DATABASE Statement")). For example, if you use
  [`--replicate-wild-do-table=foo%.%`](replication-options-replica.md#option_mysqld_replicate-wild-do-table),
  database-level statements are replicated if the database
  name matches the pattern `foo%`.

  Important

  Table-level replication filters are only applied to tables
  that are explicitly mentioned and operated on in the
  query. They do not apply to tables that are implicitly
  updated by the query. For example, a
  [`GRANT`](grant.md "15.7.1.6 GRANT Statement") statement, which
  updates the `mysql.user` system table but
  does not mention that table, is not affected by a filter
  that specifies `mysql.%` as the wildcard
  pattern.

  To include literal wildcard characters in the database or
  table name patterns, escape them with a backslash. For
  example, to replicate all tables of a database that is named
  `my_own%db`, but not replicate tables from
  the `my1ownAABCdb` database, you should
  escape the `_` and `%`
  characters like this:
  [`--replicate-wild-do-table=my\_own\%db`](replication-options-replica.md#option_mysqld_replicate-wild-do-table).
  If you use the option on the command line, you might need to
  double the backslashes or quote the option value, depending
  on your command interpreter. For example, with the
  **bash** shell, you would need to type
  [`--replicate-wild-do-table=my\\_own\\%db`](replication-options-replica.md#option_mysqld_replicate-wild-do-table).
- [`--replicate-wild-ignore-table=db_name.tbl_name`](replication-options-replica.md#option_mysqld_replicate-wild-ignore-table)

  |  |  |
  | --- | --- |
  | Command-Line Format | `--replicate-wild-ignore-table=name` |
  | Type | String |

  Creates a replication filter which keeps the replication SQL
  thread from replicating a statement in which any table
  matches the given wildcard pattern. To specify more than one
  table to ignore, use this option multiple times, once for
  each table. This works for cross-database updates. See
  [Section 19.2.5, “How Servers Evaluate Replication Filtering Rules”](replication-rules.md "19.2.5 How Servers Evaluate Replication Filtering Rules"). You can also create
  such a filter by issuing a
  [`CHANGE
  REPLICATION FILTER REPLICATE_WILD_IGNORE_TABLE`](change-replication-filter.md "15.4.2.2 CHANGE REPLICATION FILTER Statement")
  statement.

  This option supports channel specific replication filters,
  enabling multi-source replicas to use specific filters for
  different sources. To configure a channel specific
  replication filter on a channel named
  *`channel_1`* use
  `--replicate-wild-ignore:channel_1:db_name.tbl_name`.
  In this case, the first colon is interpreted as a separator
  and subsequent colons are literal colons. See
  [Section 19.2.5.4, “Replication Channel Based Filters”](replication-rules-channel-based-filters.md "19.2.5.4 Replication Channel Based Filters")
  for more information.

  Important

  Global replication filters cannot be used on a MySQL
  server instance that is configured for Group Replication,
  because filtering transactions on some servers would make
  the group unable to reach agreement on a consistent state.
  Channel specific replication filters can be used on
  replication channels that are not directly involved with
  Group Replication, such as where a group member also acts
  as a replica to a source that is outside the group. They
  cannot be used on the
  `group_replication_applier` or
  `group_replication_recovery` channels.

  As an example,
  [`--replicate-wild-ignore-table=foo%.bar%`](replication-options-replica.md#option_mysqld_replicate-wild-ignore-table)
  does not replicate updates that use a table where the
  database name starts with `foo` and the
  table name starts with `bar`. For
  information about how matching works, see the description of
  the [`--replicate-wild-do-table`](replication-options-replica.md#option_mysqld_replicate-wild-do-table)
  option. The rules for including literal wildcard characters
  in the option value are the same as for
  [`--replicate-wild-ignore-table`](replication-options-replica.md#option_mysqld_replicate-wild-ignore-table)
  as well.

  Important

  Table-level replication filters are only applied to tables
  that are explicitly mentioned and operated on in the
  query. They do not apply to tables that are implicitly
  updated by the query. For example, a
  [`GRANT`](grant.md "15.7.1.6 GRANT Statement") statement, which
  updates the `mysql.user` system table but
  does not mention that table, is not affected by a filter
  that specifies `mysql.%` as the wildcard
  pattern.

  If you need to filter out
  [`GRANT`](grant.md "15.7.1.6 GRANT Statement") statements or other
  administrative statements, a possible workaround is to use
  the [`--replicate-ignore-db`](replication-options-replica.md#option_mysqld_replicate-ignore-db)
  filter. This filter operates on the default database that is
  currently in effect, as determined by the
  [`USE`](use.md "15.8.4 USE Statement") statement. You can
  therefore create a filter to ignore statements for a
  database that is not replicated, then issue the
  [`USE`](use.md "15.8.4 USE Statement") statement
  to switch the default database to that one immediately
  before issuing any administrative statements that you want
  to ignore. In the administrative statement, name the actual
  database where the statement is applied.

  For example, if
  [`--replicate-ignore-db=nonreplicated`](replication-options-replica.md#option_mysqld_replicate-ignore-db)
  is configured on the replica server, the following sequence
  of statements causes the
  [`GRANT`](grant.md "15.7.1.6 GRANT Statement") statement to be
  ignored, because the default database
  `nonreplicated` is in effect:

  ```sql
  USE nonreplicated;
  GRANT SELECT, INSERT ON replicated.t1 TO 'someuser'@'somehost';
  ```

  | Dynamic | No |
  | [`SET_VAR`](optimizer-hints.md#optimizer-hints-set-var "Variable-Setting Hint Syntax") Hint Applies | No |
  | Type | Boolean |
  | Default Value | `OFF` |

  From MySQL 8.0.26, use
  [`--skip-replica-start`](replication-options-replica.md#option_mysqld_skip-replica-start) in place
  of [`--skip-slave-start`](replication-options-replica.md#option_mysqld_skip-slave-start), which
  is deprecated from that release. In releases before MySQL
  8.0.26, use
  [`--skip-slave-start`](replication-options-replica.md#option_mysqld_skip-slave-start).

  [`--skip-replica-start`](replication-options-replica.md#option_mysqld_skip-replica-start) tells
  the replica server not to start the replication I/O
  (receiver) and SQL (applier) threads when the server starts.
  To start the threads later, use a [`START
  REPLICA`](start-replica.md "15.4.2.6 START REPLICA Statement") statement.

  You can use the
  [`skip_replica_start`](replication-options-replica.md#sysvar_skip_replica_start) system
  variable in place of the command line option to allow access
  to this feature using MySQL Server’s privilege structure,
  so that database administrators do not need any privileged
  access to the operating system.

  | Dynamic | No |
  | [`SET_VAR`](optimizer-hints.md#optimizer-hints-set-var "Variable-Setting Hint Syntax") Hint Applies | No |
  | Type | Boolean |
  | Default Value | `OFF` |

  From MySQL 8.0.26,
  [`--skip-slave-start`](replication-options-replica.md#option_mysqld_skip-slave-start) is
  deprecated and the alias
  [`--skip-replica-start`](replication-options-replica.md#option_mysqld_skip-replica-start) should
  be used instead. In releases before MySQL 8.0.26, use
  [`--skip-slave-start`](replication-options-replica.md#option_mysqld_skip-slave-start).

  Tells the replica server not to start the replication I/O
  (receiver) and SQL (applier) threads when the server starts.
  To start the threads later, use a [`START
  REPLICA`](start-replica.md "15.4.2.6 START REPLICA Statement") statement.

  From MySQL 8.0.24, you can use the
  [`skip_slave_start`](replication-options-replica.md#sysvar_skip_slave_start) system
  variable in place of the command line option to allow access
  to this feature using MySQL Server’s privilege structure,
  so that database administrators do not need any privileged
  access to the operating system.
- [`--slave-skip-errors=[err_code1,err_code2,...|all|ddl_exist_errors]`](replication-options-replica.md#option_mysqld_slave-skip-errors)

  |  |  |
  | --- | --- |
  | Command-Line Format | `--slave-skip-errors=name` |
  | Deprecated | 8.0.26 |
  | System Variable | `slave_skip_errors` |
  | Scope | Global |
  | Dynamic | No |

  | Type | String |
  | Default Value | `OFF` |
  | Valid Values | `OFF`  `[list of error codes]`  `all`  `ddl_exist_errors` |

  Normally, replication stops when an error occurs on the
  replica, which gives you the opportunity to resolve the
  inconsistency in the data manually. This option causes the
  replication SQL thread to continue replication when a
  statement returns any of the errors listed in the option
  value.

  Do not use this option unless you fully understand why you
  are getting errors. If there are no bugs in your replication
  setup and client programs, and no bugs in MySQL itself, an
  error that stops replication should never occur.
  Indiscriminate use of this option results in replicas
  becoming hopelessly out of synchrony with the source, with
  you having no idea why this has occurred.

  For error codes, you should use the numbers provided by the
  error message in your replica's error log and in the output
  of [`SHOW REPLICA STATUS`](show-replica-status.md "15.7.7.35 SHOW REPLICA STATUS Statement").
  [Appendix B, *Error Messages and Common Problems*](error-handling.md "Appendix B Error Messages and Common Problems"), lists server error codes.

  The shorthand value `ddl_exist_errors` is
  equivalent to the error code list
  `1007,1008,1050,1051,1054,1060,1061,1068,1091,1146`.

  You can also (but should not) use the very nonrecommended
  value of `all` to cause the replica to
  ignore all error messages and keeps going regardless of what
  happens. Needless to say, if you use `all`,
  there are no guarantees regarding the integrity of your
  data. Please do not complain (or file bug reports) in this
  case if the replica's data is not anywhere close to what it
  is on the source. *You have been warned*.

  This option does not work in the same way when replicating
  between NDB Clusters, due to the internal
  [`NDB`](mysql-cluster.md "Chapter 25 MySQL NDB Cluster 8.0") mechanism for checking
  epoch sequence numbers; normally, as soon as
  `NDB` detects an epoch number that is
  missing or otherwise out of sequence, it immediately stops
  the replica applier thread. Beginning with NDB 8.0.28, you
  can override this behavior by also specifying
  [`--ndb-applier-allow-skip-epoch`](mysql-cluster-options-variables.md#option_mysqld_ndb-applier-allow-skip-epoch)
  together with `--slave-skip-errors`; doing so
  causes `NDB` to ignore skipped epoch
  transactions.

  Examples:

  ```terminal
  --slave-skip-errors=1062,1053
  --slave-skip-errors=all
  --slave-skip-errors=ddl_exist_errors
  ```
- [`--slave-sql-verify-checksum={0|1}`](replication-options-replica.md#option_mysqld_slave-sql-verify-checksum)

  |  |  |
  | --- | --- |
  | Command-Line Format | `--slave-sql-verify-checksum[={OFF|ON}]` |
  | Type | Boolean |
  | Default Value | `ON` |

  When this option is enabled, the replica examines checksums
  read from the relay log. In the event of a mismatch, the
  replica stops with an error.

The following options are used internally by the MySQL test
suite for replication testing and debugging. They are not
intended for use in a production setting.

- [`--abort-slave-event-count`](replication-options-replica.md#option_mysqld_abort-slave-event-count)

  |  |  |
  | --- | --- |
  | Command-Line Format | `--abort-slave-event-count=#` |
  | Deprecated | 8.0.29 |
  | Type | Integer |
  | Default Value | `0` |
  | Minimum Value | `0` |

  When this option is set to some positive integer
  *`value`* other than 0 (the default)
  it affects replication behavior as follows: After the
  replication SQL thread has started,
  *`value`* log events are permitted to
  be executed; after that, the replication SQL thread does not
  receive any more events, just as if the network connection
  from the source were cut. The replication SQL thread
  continues to run, and the output from
  [`SHOW REPLICA STATUS`](show-replica-status.md "15.7.7.35 SHOW REPLICA STATUS Statement") displays
  `Yes` in both the
  `Replica_IO_Running` and the
  `Replica_SQL_Running` columns, but no
  further events are read from the relay log.

  This option is used internally by the MySQL test suite for
  replication testing and debugging. It is not intended for
  use in a production setting. Beginning with MySQL 8.0.29, it
  is deprecated, and subject to removal in a future version of
  MySQL.

  This option is used internally by the MySQL test suite for
  replication testing and debugging. It is not intended for
  use in a production setting. Beginning with MySQL 8.0.29, it
  is deprecated, and subject to removal in a future version of
  MySQL.

##### System Variables Used on Replica Servers

The following list describes system variables for controlling
replica servers. They can be set at server startup and some of
them can be changed at runtime using
[`SET`](set-variable.md "15.7.6.1 SET Syntax for Variable Assignment").
Server options used with replicas are listed earlier in this
section.

- [`init_replica`](replication-options-replica.md#sysvar_init_replica)

  | --- | --- |
  | Command-Line Format | `--init-replica=name` |
  | Introduced | 8.0.26 |
  | System Variable | `init_replica` |
  | Scope | Global |
  | Dynamic | Yes |
  | [`SET_VAR`](optimizer-hints.md#optimizer-hints-set-var "Variable-Setting Hint Syntax") Hint Applies | No |
  | Type | String |

  From MySQL 8.0.26, use
  [`init_replica`](replication-options-replica.md#sysvar_init_replica) in place of
  [`init_slave`](replication-options-replica.md#sysvar_init_slave), which is
  deprecated from that release. In releases before MySQL
  8.0.26, use [`init_slave`](replication-options-replica.md#sysvar_init_slave).

  [`init_replica`](replication-options-replica.md#sysvar_init_replica) is similar to
  [`init_connect`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_init_connect), but is a
  string to be executed by a replica server each time the
  replication SQL thread starts. The format of the string is
  the same as for the
  [`init_connect`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_init_connect) variable. The
  setting of this variable takes effect for subsequent
  [`START REPLICA`](start-replica.md "15.4.2.6 START REPLICA Statement") statements.

  Note

  The replication SQL thread sends an acknowledgment to the
  client before it executes
  [`init_replica`](replication-options-replica.md#sysvar_init_replica). Therefore,
  it is not guaranteed that
  [`init_replica`](replication-options-replica.md#sysvar_init_replica) has been
  executed when [`START REPLICA`](start-replica.md "15.4.2.6 START REPLICA Statement")
  returns. See [Section 15.4.2.6, “START REPLICA Statement”](start-replica.md "15.4.2.6 START REPLICA Statement") for more
  information.

  | [`SET_VAR`](optimizer-hints.md#optimizer-hints-set-var "Variable-Setting Hint Syntax") Hint Applies | No |
  | Type | String |

  From MySQL 8.0.26,
  [`init_slave`](replication-options-replica.md#sysvar_init_slave) is deprecated
  and the alias [`init_replica`](replication-options-replica.md#sysvar_init_replica)
  should be used instead. In releases before MySQL 8.0.26, use
  [`init_slave`](replication-options-replica.md#sysvar_init_slave).

  [`init_slave`](replication-options-replica.md#sysvar_init_slave) is similar to
  [`init_connect`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_init_connect), but is a
  string to be executed by a replica server each time the
  replication SQL thread starts. The format of the string is
  the same as for the
  [`init_connect`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_init_connect) variable. The
  setting of this variable takes effect for subsequent
  [`START REPLICA`](start-replica.md "15.4.2.6 START REPLICA Statement") statements.

  Note

  The replication SQL thread sends an acknowledgment to the
  client before it executes
  [`init_slave`](replication-options-replica.md#sysvar_init_slave). Therefore, it
  is not guaranteed that
  [`init_slave`](replication-options-replica.md#sysvar_init_slave) has been
  executed when [`START REPLICA`](start-replica.md "15.4.2.6 START REPLICA Statement")
  returns. See [Section 15.4.2.6, “START REPLICA Statement”](start-replica.md "15.4.2.6 START REPLICA Statement") for more
  information.

  in place of
  [`log_slow_slave_statements`](replication-options-replica.md#sysvar_log_slow_slave_statements),

  MySQL 8.0.26, use
  [`log_slow_slave_statements`](replication-options-replica.md#sysvar_log_slow_slave_statements).

  When the slow query log is enabled,
  [`log_slow_replica_statements`](replication-options-replica.md#sysvar_log_slow_replica_statements)
  enables logging for queries that have taken more than
  [`long_query_time`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_long_query_time) seconds to

  [`log_slow_replica_statements`](replication-options-replica.md#sysvar_log_slow_replica_statements)
  has no effect. Queries are only added to the replica's slow
  query log when they are logged in statement format in the

  The use of this system variable is now deprecated. The
  setting `TABLE` is the default, and is

  The alternative setting `FILE` was
  previously deprecated.

  With the default setting, the replica records metadata about
  the source, consisting of status and connection information,
  to an `InnoDB` table in the
  `mysql` system database named
  `mysql.slave_master_info`. For more
  information on the connection metadata repository, see
  [Section 19.2.4, “Relay Log and Replication Metadata Repositories”](replica-logs.md "19.2.4 Relay Log and Replication Metadata Repositories").

  The `FILE` setting wrote the replica's
  connection metadata repository to a file, which was named
  `master.info` by default. The name could
  be changed using the
  [`--master-info-file`](replication-options-replica.md#option_mysqld_master-info-file) option.

  If a write by a replica to its relay log causes the current
  log file size to exceed the value of this variable, the
  replica rotates the relay logs (closes the current file and
  opens the next one). If
  [`max_relay_log_size`](replication-options-replica.md#sysvar_max_relay_log_size) is 0,
  the server uses
  [`max_binlog_size`](replication-options-binary-log.md#sysvar_max_binlog_size) for both
  the binary log and the relay log. If
  [`max_relay_log_size`](replication-options-replica.md#sysvar_max_relay_log_size) is
  greater than 0, it constrains the size of the relay log,
  which enables you to have different sizes for the two logs.
  You must set
  [`max_relay_log_size`](replication-options-replica.md#sysvar_max_relay_log_size) to
  between 4096 bytes and 1GB (inclusive), or to 0. The default
  value is 0. See [Section 19.2.3, “Replication Threads”](replication-threads.md "19.2.3 Replication Threads").
- [`relay_log`](replication-options-replica.md#sysvar_relay_log)

  | Scope | Global |
  | Dynamic | No |
  | [`SET_VAR`](optimizer-hints.md#optimizer-hints-set-var "Variable-Setting Hint Syntax") Hint Applies | No |
  | Type | File name |

  The base name for relay log files. For the default
  replication channel, the default base name for relay logs is
  `host_name-relay-bin`.
  For non-default replication channels, the default base name
  for relay logs is
  `host_name-relay-bin-channel`,
  where *`channel`* is the name of the
  replication channel recorded in this relay log.

  The server writes the file in the data directory unless the
  base name is given with a leading absolute path name to
  specify a different directory. The server creates relay log
  files in sequence by adding a numeric suffix to the base
  name.

  The relay log and relay log index on a replication server
  cannot be given the same names as the binary log and binary
  log index, whose names are specified by the
  [`--log-bin`](replication-options-binary-log.md#option_mysqld_log-bin) and
  [`--log-bin-index`](replication-options-binary-log.md#option_mysqld_log-bin-index) options. The
  server issues an error message and does not start if the
  binary log and relay log file base names would be the same.

  Due to the manner in which MySQL parses server options, if
  you specify this variable at server startup, you must supply
  a value; *the default base name is used only if the
  option is not actually specified*. If you specify
  the [`relay_log`](replication-options-replica.md#sysvar_relay_log) system
  variable at server startup without specifying a value,
  unexpected behavior is likely to result; this behavior
  depends on the other options used, the order in which they
  are specified, and whether they are specified on the command
  line or in an option file. For more information about how
  MySQL handles server options, see
  [Section 6.2.2, “Specifying Program Options”](program-options.md "6.2.2 Specifying Program Options").

  If you specify this variable, the value specified is also
  used as the base name for the relay log index file. You can
  override this behavior by specifying a different relay log
  index file base name using the
  [`relay_log_index`](replication-options-replica.md#sysvar_relay_log_index) system
  variable.

  When the server reads an entry from the index file, it
  checks whether the entry contains a relative path. If it
  does, the relative part of the path is replaced with the
  absolute path set using the
  [`relay_log`](replication-options-replica.md#sysvar_relay_log) system variable.
  An absolute path remains unchanged; in such a case, the
  index must be edited manually to enable the new path or
  paths to be used.

  You may find the [`relay_log`](replication-options-replica.md#sysvar_relay_log)
  system variable useful in performing the following tasks:

  - Creating relay logs whose names are independent of host
    names.
  - If you need to put the relay logs in some area other
    than the data directory because your relay logs tend to
    be very large and you do not want to decrease
    [`max_relay_log_size`](replication-options-replica.md#sysvar_max_relay_log_size).
  - To increase speed by using load-balancing between disks.

  You can obtain the relay log file name (and path) from the
  [`relay_log_basename`](replication-options-replica.md#sysvar_relay_log_basename) system
  variable.

  The name for the relay log index file. The maximum variable
  length is 256. If you do not specify this variable, but the
  [`relay_log`](replication-options-replica.md#sysvar_relay_log) system variable
  is specified, its value is used as the default base name for
  the relay log index file. If
  [`relay_log`](replication-options-replica.md#sysvar_relay_log) is also not
  specified, then for the default replication channel, the
  default name is
  `host_name-relay-bin.index`,
  using the name of the host machine. For non-default
  replication channels, the default name is
  `host_name-relay-bin-channel.index`,
  where *`channel`* is the name of the
  replication channel recorded in this relay log index.

  The default location for relay log files is the data
  directory, or any other location that was specified using
  the [`relay_log`](replication-options-replica.md#sysvar_relay_log) system
  variable. You can use the
  [`relay_log_index`](replication-options-replica.md#sysvar_relay_log_index) system
  variable to specify an alternative location, by adding a
  leading absolute path name to the base name to specify a
  different directory.

  The relay log and relay log index on a replication server
  cannot be given the same names as the binary log and binary
  log index, whose names are specified by the
  [`--log-bin`](replication-options-binary-log.md#option_mysqld_log-bin) and
  [`--log-bin-index`](replication-options-binary-log.md#option_mysqld_log-bin-index) options. The

  The use of this system variable is now deprecated. The
  setting `TABLE` is the default, and is
  required when multiple replication channels are configured.
  The `TABLE` setting for the replica's
  applier metadata repository is also required to make
  replication resilient to unexpected halts. See
  [Section 19.4.2, “Handling an Unexpected Halt of a Replica”](replication-solutions-unexpected-replica-halt.md "19.4.2 Handling an Unexpected Halt of a Replica")
  for more information. The alternative setting
  `FILE` was previously deprecated.

  With the default setting, the replica stores its applier
  metadata repository as an `InnoDB` table in
  the `mysql` system database named
  `mysql.slave_relay_log_info`. For more
  information on the applier metadata repository, see
  [Section 19.2.4, “Relay Log and Replication Metadata Repositories”](replica-logs.md "19.2.4 Relay Log and Replication Metadata Repositories").

  The `FILE` setting wrote the replica's
  applier metadata repository to a file, which was named
  `relay-log.info` by default. The name
  could be changed using the
  [`relay_log_info_file`](replication-options-replica.md#sysvar_relay_log_info_file) system

  | Type | Boolean |
  | Default Value | `OFF` |

  If enabled, this variable enables automatic relay log
  recovery immediately following server startup. The recovery
  process creates a new relay log file, initializes the SQL
  (applier) thread position to this new relay log, and
  initializes the I/O (receiver) thread to the applier thread
  position. Reading of the relay log from the source then
  continues. If `SOURCE_AUTO_POSITION=1` was
  set for the replication channel using the
  [`CHANGE REPLICATION
  SOURCE TO`](change-replication-source-to.md "15.4.2.3 CHANGE REPLICATION SOURCE TO Statement") option, the source position used to
  start replication might be the one received in the
  connection and not the ones assigned in this process.

  This global variable is read-only at runtime. Its value can
  be set with the
  [`--relay-log-recovery`](replication-options-replica.md#sysvar_relay_log_recovery) option
  at replica server startup, which should be used following an
  unexpected halt of a replica to ensure that no possibly
  corrupted relay logs are processed, and must be used in
  order to guarantee a crash-safe replica. The default value
  is 0 (disabled). For information on the combination of
  settings on a replica that is most resilient to unexpected
  halts, see
  [Section 19.4.2, “Handling an Unexpected Halt of a Replica”](replication-solutions-unexpected-replica-halt.md "19.4.2 Handling an Unexpected Halt of a Replica").

  For a multithreaded replica (where
  [`replica_parallel_workers`](replication-options-replica.md#sysvar_replica_parallel_workers) or
  [`slave_parallel_workers`](replication-options-replica.md#sysvar_slave_parallel_workers) is
  greater than 0), setting
  [`--relay-log-recovery`](replication-options-replica.md#sysvar_relay_log_recovery) at
  startup automatically handles any inconsistencies and gaps
  in the sequence of transactions that have been executed from
  the relay log. These gaps can occur when file position based
  replication is in use. (For more details, see
  [Section 19.5.1.34, “Replication and Transaction Inconsistencies”](replication-features-transaction-inconsistencies.md "19.5.1.34 Replication and Transaction Inconsistencies").)
  The relay log recovery process deals with gaps using the
  same method as the
  [`START REPLICA
  UNTIL SQL_AFTER_MTS_GAPS`](start-replica.md "15.4.2.6 START REPLICA Statement") statement would. When the
  replica reaches a consistent gap-free state, the relay log
  recovery process goes on to fetch further transactions from
  the source beginning at the SQL (applier) thread position.
  When GTID-based replication is in use, from MySQL 8.0.18 a
  multithreaded replica checks first whether
  `MASTER_AUTO_POSITION` is set to
  `ON`, and if it is, omits the step of
  calculating the transactions that should be skipped or not
  skipped, so that the old relay logs are not required for the
  recovery process.

  Note

  This variable does not affect the following Group
  Replication channels:

  - `group_replication_applier`
  - `group_replication_recovery`

  Any other channels running on a group are affected, such
  as a channel which is replicating from an outside source
  or another group.

  statements.

  Previously, multithreaded replicas were not supported by NDB
  Cluster, which silently ignored the setting for this
  variable. This restriction was lifted in MySQL 8.0.33.

  This variable works in combination with the
  [`replica_checkpoint_period`](replication-options-replica.md#sysvar_replica_checkpoint_period)
  system variable in such a way that, when either limit is
  exceeded, the checkpoint is executed and the counters
  tracking both the number of transactions and the time
  elapsed since the last checkpoint are reset.

  The minimum allowed value for this variable is 32, unless
  the server was built using
  [`-DWITH_DEBUG`](source-configuration-options.md#option_cmake_with_debug), in which case
  the minimum value is 1. The effective value is always a
  multiple of 8; you can set it to a value that is not such a
  multiple, but the server rounds it down to the next lower
  multiple of 8 before storing the value.
  (*Exception*: No such rounding is
  performed by the debug server.) Regardless of how the server
  was built, the default value is 512, and the maximum allowed
  value is 524280.

  | Maximum Value | `4294967295` |
  | Unit | milliseconds |

  In MySQL 8.0.26 and later, use
  [`replica_checkpoint_period`](replication-options-replica.md#sysvar_replica_checkpoint_period)
  in place of
  [`slave_checkpoint_period`](replication-options-replica.md#sysvar_slave_checkpoint_period),
  which is deprecated from that release; prior to MySQL
  8.0.26, use
  [`slave_checkpoint_period`](replication-options-replica.md#sysvar_slave_checkpoint_period).

  `replica_checkpoint_period` sets the
  maximum time (in milliseconds) that is allowed to pass
  before a checkpoint operation is called to update the status
  of a multithreaded replica as shown by
  [`SHOW REPLICA STATUS`](show-replica-status.md "15.7.7.35 SHOW REPLICA STATUS Statement"). Setting
  this variable has no effect on replicas for which
  multithreading is not enabled. Setting this variable takes
  effect for all replication channels immediately, including
  running channels.

  Previously, multithreaded replicas were not supported by NDB
  Cluster, which silently ignored the setting for this
  variable. This restriction was lifted in MySQL 8.0.33.

  This variable works in combination with the
  [`replica_checkpoint_group`](replication-options-replica.md#sysvar_replica_checkpoint_group)
  system variable in such a way that, when either limit is
  exceeded, the checkpoint is executed and the counters
  tracking both the number of transactions and the time
  elapsed since the last checkpoint are reset.

  The minimum allowed value for this variable is 1, unless the
  server was built using
  [`-DWITH_DEBUG`](source-configuration-options.md#option_cmake_with_debug), in which case
  the minimum value is 0. Regardless of how the server was
  built, the default value is 300 milliseconds, and the
  maximum possible value is 4294967295 milliseconds
  (approximately 49.7 days).

  | [`SET_VAR`](optimizer-hints.md#optimizer-hints-set-var "Variable-Setting Hint Syntax") Hint Applies | No |
  | Type | Boolean |
  | Default Value | `OFF` |

  From MySQL 8.0.26, use
  [`replica_compressed_protocol`](replication-options-replica.md#sysvar_replica_compressed_protocol)
  in place of
  [`slave_compressed_protocol`](replication-options-replica.md#sysvar_slave_compressed_protocol),
  which is deprecated. In releases before MySQL 8.0.26, use
  [`slave_compressed_protocol`](replication-options-replica.md#sysvar_slave_compressed_protocol).

  [`replica_compressed_protocol`](replication-options-replica.md#sysvar_replica_compressed_protocol)
  specifies whether to use compression of the source/replica
  connection protocol if both source and replica support it.
  If this variable is disabled (the default), connections are
  uncompressed. Changes to this variable take effect on
  subsequent connection attempts; this includes after issuing
  a [`START REPLICA`](start-replica.md "15.4.2.6 START REPLICA Statement") statement, as
  well as reconnections made by a running replication I/O
  (receiver) thread.

  Binary log transaction compression (available as of MySQL
  8.0.20), which is activated by the
  [`binlog_transaction_compression`](replication-options-binary-log.md#sysvar_binlog_transaction_compression)
  system variable, can also be used to save bandwidth. If you
  use binary log transaction compression in combination with
  protocol compression, protocol compression has less
  opportunity to act on the data, but can still compress
  headers and those events and transaction payloads that are
  uncompressed. For more information on binary log transaction
  compression, see
  [Section 7.4.4.5, “Binary Log Transaction Compression”](binary-log-transaction-compression.md "7.4.4.5 Binary Log Transaction Compression").

  If
  [`replica_compressed_protocol`](replication-options-replica.md#sysvar_replica_compressed_protocol)
  is enabled, it takes precedence over any
  `SOURCE_COMPRESSION_ALGORITHMS` option
  specified for the [`CHANGE REPLICATION
  SOURCE TO`](change-replication-source-to.md "15.4.2.3 CHANGE REPLICATION SOURCE TO Statement") statement. In this case, connections to
  the source use `zlib` compression if both
  the source and replica support that algorithm. If
  [`replica_compressed_protocol`](replication-options-replica.md#sysvar_replica_compressed_protocol)
  is disabled, the value of
  `SOURCE_COMPRESSION_ALGORITHMS` applies.
  For more information, see
  [Section 6.2.8, “Connection Compression Control”](connection-compression-control.md "6.2.8 Connection Compression Control").

  | Dynamic | Yes |
  | [`SET_VAR`](optimizer-hints.md#optimizer-hints-set-var "Variable-Setting Hint Syntax") Hint Applies | No |
  | Type | Enumeration |
  | Default Value | `IDEMPOTENT` (NDB)  `STRICT` (Other) |
  | Valid Values | `STRICT`  `IDEMPOTENT` |

  From MySQL 8.0.26, use
  [`replica_exec_mode`](replication-options-replica.md#sysvar_replica_exec_mode) in place
  of [`slave_exec_mode`](replication-options-replica.md#sysvar_slave_exec_mode), which
  is deprecated from that release. In releases before MySQL
  8.0.26, use
  [`slave_exec_mode`](replication-options-replica.md#sysvar_slave_exec_mode).

  [`replica_exec_mode`](replication-options-replica.md#sysvar_replica_exec_mode) controls
  how a replication thread resolves conflicts and errors
  during replication. `IDEMPOTENT` mode
  causes suppression of duplicate-key and no-key-found errors;
  `STRICT` means no such suppression takes
  place.

  `IDEMPOTENT` mode is intended for use in
  multi-source replication, circular replication, and some
  other special replication scenarios for NDB Cluster
  Replication. (See
  [Section 25.7.10, “NDB Cluster Replication: Bidirectional and Circular Replication”](mysql-cluster-replication-multi-source.md "25.7.10 NDB Cluster Replication: Bidirectional and Circular Replication"),
  and
  [Section 25.7.12, “NDB Cluster Replication Conflict Resolution”](mysql-cluster-replication-conflict-resolution.md "25.7.12 NDB Cluster Replication Conflict Resolution"),
  for more information.) NDB Cluster ignores any value
  explicitly set for
  [`replica_exec_mode`](replication-options-replica.md#sysvar_replica_exec_mode), and
  always treats it as `IDEMPOTENT`.

  In MySQL Server 8.0, `STRICT`
  mode is the default value.

  Setting this variable takes immediate effect for all
  replication channels, including running channels.

  For storage engines other than
  [`NDB`](mysql-cluster.md "Chapter 25 MySQL NDB Cluster 8.0"),
  *`IDEMPOTENT` mode should be used
  only when you are absolutely sure that duplicate-key errors
  and key-not-found errors can safely be ignored*.
  It is meant to be used in fail-over scenarios for NDB
  Cluster where multi-source replication or circular
  replication is employed, and is not recommended for use in
  other cases.
- [`replica_load_tmpdir`](replication-options-replica.md#sysvar_replica_load_tmpdir)

  |  |  |
  | --- | --- |
  | Command-Line Format | `--replica-load-tmpdir=dir_name` |
  | Introduced | 8.0.26 |
  | System Variable | `replica_load_tmpdir` |

  | [`SET_VAR`](optimizer-hints.md#optimizer-hints-set-var "Variable-Setting Hint Syntax") Hint Applies | No |
  | Type | Directory name |
  | Default Value | `Value of --tmpdir` |

  From MySQL 8.0.26, use
  [`replica_load_tmpdir`](replication-options-replica.md#sysvar_replica_load_tmpdir) in
  place of [`slave_load_tmpdir`](replication-options-replica.md#sysvar_slave_load_tmpdir),
  which is deprecated from that release. In releases before
  MySQL 8.0.26, use
  [`slave_load_tmpdir`](replication-options-replica.md#sysvar_slave_load_tmpdir).

  [`replica_load_tmpdir`](replication-options-replica.md#sysvar_replica_load_tmpdir)
  specifies the name of the directory where the replica
  creates temporary files. Setting this variable takes effect
  for all replication channels immediately, including running
  channels. The variable value is by default equal to the
  value of the [`tmpdir`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_tmpdir) system
  variable, or the default that applies when that system
  variable is not specified.

  When the replication SQL thread replicates a
  [`LOAD DATA`](load-data.md "15.2.9 LOAD DATA Statement") statement, it
  extracts the file to be loaded from the relay log into
  temporary files, and then loads these into the table. If the
  file loaded on the source is huge, the temporary files on
  the replica are huge, too. Therefore, it might be advisable
  to use this option to tell the replica to put temporary
  files in a directory located in some file system that has a
  lot of available space. In that case, the relay logs are
  huge as well, so you might also want to set the
  [`relay_log`](replication-options-replica.md#sysvar_relay_log) system variable
  to place the relay logs in that file system.

  The directory specified by this option should be located in
  a disk-based file system (not a memory-based file system) so
  that the temporary files used to replicate
  [`LOAD DATA`](load-data.md "15.2.9 LOAD DATA Statement") statements can
  survive machine restarts. The directory also should not be
  one that is cleared by the operating system during the
  system startup process. However, replication can now
  continue after a restart if the temporary files have been
  removed.

  | Unit | bytes |
  | [Block Size](server-system-variables.md#system-variables-block-size "Note") | `1024` |

  From MySQL 8.0.26, use
  [`replica_max_allowed_packet`](replication-options-replica.md#sysvar_replica_max_allowed_packet)
  in place of
  [`slave_max_allowed_packet`](replication-options-replica.md#sysvar_slave_max_allowed_packet),
  which is deprecated from that release. In releases before
  MySQL 8.0.26, use
  [`slave_max_allowed_packet`](replication-options-replica.md#sysvar_slave_max_allowed_packet).

  [`replica_max_allowed_packet`](replication-options-replica.md#sysvar_replica_max_allowed_packet)
  sets the maximum packet size in bytes that the replication
  SQL (applier)and I/O (receiver) threads can handle. Setting
  this variable takes effect for all replication channels
  immediately, including running channels. It is possible for
  a source to write binary log events longer than its
  [`max_allowed_packet`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_max_allowed_packet) setting
  once the event header is added. The setting for
  [`replica_max_allowed_packet`](replication-options-replica.md#sysvar_replica_max_allowed_packet)
  must be larger than the
  [`max_allowed_packet`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_max_allowed_packet) setting
  on the source, so that large updates using row-based
  replication do not cause replication to fail.

  This global variable always has a value that is a positive
  integer multiple of 1024; if you set it to some value that
  is not, the value is rounded down to the next highest
  multiple of 1024 for it is stored or used; setting
  `replica_max_allowed_packet` to 0 causes
  1024 to be used. (A truncation warning is issued in all such
  cases.) The default and maximum value is 1073741824 (1 GB);
  the minimum is 1024.

  From MySQL 8.0.26, use
  [`replica_net_timeout`](replication-options-replica.md#sysvar_replica_net_timeout) in
  place of [`slave_net_timeout`](replication-options-replica.md#sysvar_slave_net_timeout),
  which is deprecated from that release. In releases before
  MySQL 8.0.26, use
  [`slave_net_timeout`](replication-options-replica.md#sysvar_slave_net_timeout).

  [`replica_net_timeout`](replication-options-replica.md#sysvar_replica_net_timeout)
  specifies the number of seconds to wait for more data or a
  heartbeat signal from the source before the replica
  considers the connection broken, aborts the read, and tries
  to reconnect. Setting this variable has no immediate effect.
  The state of the variable applies on all subsequent
  [`START REPLICA`](start-replica.md "15.4.2.6 START REPLICA Statement") commands.

  The default value is 60 seconds (one minute). The first
  retry occurs immediately after the timeout. The interval
  between retries is controlled by the
  `SOURCE_CONNECT_RETRY` option for the
  [`CHANGE REPLICATION SOURCE TO`](change-replication-source-to.md "15.4.2.3 CHANGE REPLICATION SOURCE TO Statement")
  statement, and the number of reconnection attempts is
  limited by the `SOURCE_RETRY_COUNT` option.

  The heartbeat interval, which stops the connection timeout
  occurring in the absence of data if the connection is still
  good, is controlled by the
  `SOURCE_HEARTBEAT_PERIOD` option for the
  [`CHANGE REPLICATION SOURCE TO`](change-replication-source-to.md "15.4.2.3 CHANGE REPLICATION SOURCE TO Statement")
  statement. The heartbeat interval defaults to half the value
  of [`replica_net_timeout`](replication-options-replica.md#sysvar_replica_net_timeout), and
  it is recorded in the replica's connection metadata
  repository and shown in the
  [`replication_connection_configuration`](performance-schema-replication-connection-configuration-table.md "29.12.11.10 The replication_connection_configuration Table")
  Performance Schema table. Note that a change to the value or
  default setting of
  [`replica_net_timeout`](replication-options-replica.md#sysvar_replica_net_timeout) does
  not automatically change the heartbeat interval, whether
  that has been set explicitly or is using a previously
  calculated default. If the connection timeout is changed,
  you must also issue [`CHANGE REPLICATION
  SOURCE TO`](change-replication-source-to.md "15.4.2.3 CHANGE REPLICATION SOURCE TO Statement") to adjust the heartbeat interval to an
  appropriate value so that it occurs before the connection
  timeout.
- [`replica_parallel_type`](replication-options-replica.md#sysvar_replica_parallel_type)

  |  |  |
  | --- | --- |
  | Command-Line Format | `--replica-parallel-type=value` |

  | Default Value (≥ 8.0.27) | `LOGICAL_CLOCK` |
  | Default Value (8.0.26) | `DATABASE` |
  | Valid Values | `DATABASE`  `LOGICAL_CLOCK` |

  From MySQL 8.0.26, use
  [`replica_parallel_type`](replication-options-replica.md#sysvar_replica_parallel_type) in
  place of
  [`slave_parallel_type`](replication-options-replica.md#sysvar_slave_parallel_type), which
  is deprecated from that release. In releases before MySQL
  8.0.26, use
  [`slave_parallel_type`](replication-options-replica.md#sysvar_slave_parallel_type).

  For multithreaded replicas (replicas on which
  [`replica_parallel_workers`](replication-options-replica.md#sysvar_replica_parallel_workers) or
  [`slave_parallel_workers`](replication-options-replica.md#sysvar_slave_parallel_workers) is
  set to a value greater than 0),
  [`replica_parallel_type`](replication-options-replica.md#sysvar_replica_parallel_type)
  specifies the policy used to decide which transactions are
  allowed to execute in parallel on the replica. The variable
  has no effect on replicas for which multithreading is not
  enabled. The possible values are:

  - `LOGICAL_CLOCK`: Transactions are
    applied in parallel on the replica, based on timestamps
    which the replication source writes to the binary log.
    Dependencies between transactions are tracked based on
    their timestamps to provide additional parallelization
    where possible.
  - `DATABASE`: Transactions that update
    different databases are applied in parallel. This value
    is only appropriate if data is partitioned into multiple
    databases which are being updated independently and
    concurrently on the source. There must be no
    cross-database constraints, as such constraints may be
    violated on the replica.

  When
  [`replica_preserve_commit_order`](replication-options-replica.md#sysvar_replica_preserve_commit_order)
  or
  [`slave_preserve_commit_order`](replication-options-replica.md#sysvar_slave_preserve_commit_order)
  is enabled, you must use `LOGICAL_CLOCK`.
  Before MySQL 8.0.27, `DATABASE` is the
  default. From MySQL 8.0.27, multithreading is enabled by
  default for replica servers
  ([`replica_parallel_workers=4`](replication-options-replica.md#sysvar_replica_parallel_workers)
  by default), and `LOGICAL_CLOCK` is the
  default. (In MySQL 8.0.27 and later,
  [`replica_preserve_commit_order`](replication-options-replica.md#sysvar_replica_preserve_commit_order)
  is also enabled by default.)

  When the replication topology uses multiple levels of
  replicas, `LOGICAL_CLOCK` may achieve less
  parallelization for each level the replica is away from the
  source. To compensate for this effect, you should set
  `binlog_transaction_dependency_tracking` to
  `WRITESET` or
  `WRITESET_SESSION` on the source
  *as well as on every intermediate
  replica* to specify that write sets are used
  instead of timestamps for parallelization where possible.

  When binary log transaction compression is enabled using the
  [`binlog_transaction_compression`](replication-options-binary-log.md#sysvar_binlog_transaction_compression)
  system variable, if
  [`replica_parallel_type`](replication-options-replica.md#sysvar_replica_parallel_type) is
  set to `DATABASE`, all the databases
  affected by the transaction are mapped before the
  transaction is scheduled. The use of binary log transaction
  compression with the `DATABASE` policy can
  reduce parallelism compared to uncompressed transactions,
  which are mapped and scheduled for each event.

  `replica_parallel_type` is deprecated
  beginning with MySQL 8.0.29, as is support for
  parallelization of transactions using database partitioning.
  Expect support for these to be removed in a future release,
  and for `LOGICAL_CLOCK` to be used
  exclusively thereafter.
- [`replica_parallel_workers`](replication-options-replica.md#sysvar_replica_parallel_workers)

  |  |  |

  | Default Value (≥ 8.0.27) | `4` |
  | Default Value (8.0.26) | `0` |
  | Minimum Value | `0` |
  | Maximum Value | `1024` |

  Beginning with MySQL 8.0.26,
  [`slave_parallel_workers`](replication-options-replica.md#sysvar_slave_parallel_workers) is
  deprecated, and you should use
  `replica_parallel_workers` instead. (Prior
  to MySQL 8.0.26, you must use
  `slave_parallel_workers` to set the number
  of applier threads.)

  `replica_parallel_workers` enables
  multithreading on the replica and sets the number of applier
  threads for executing replication transactions in parallel.
  When the value is greater than or equal to 1, the replica
  uses the specified number of worker threads to execute
  transactions, plus a coordinator thread that reads
  transactions from the relay log and schedules them to
  workers. When the value is 0, there is only one thread that
  reads and applies transactions sequentially. If you are
  using multiple replication channels, the value of this
  variable applies to the threads used by each channel.

  Prior to MySQL 8.0.27, the default value of this system
  variable is 0, so replicas use a single worker thread by
  default. Beginning with MySQL 8.0.27, the default value is
  4, which means that replicas are multithreaded by default.

  As of MySQL 8.0.30, setting this variable to 0 is
  deprecated, raises a warning, and is subject to removal in a
  future MySQL release. For a single worker, set
  `replica_parallel_workers` to 1 instead.

  When
  [`replica_preserve_commit_order`](replication-options-replica.md#sysvar_replica_preserve_commit_order)
  (or
  [`slave_preserve_commit_order`](replication-options-replica.md#sysvar_slave_preserve_commit_order))
  is set to `ON` (the default in MySQL 8.0.27
  and later), transactions on a replica are externalized on
  the replica in the same order as they appear in the
  replica's relay log. The way in which transactions are
  distributed among applier threads is determined by
  [`replica_parallel_type`](replication-options-replica.md#sysvar_replica_parallel_type)
  (MySQL 8.0.26 and later) or
  [`slave_parallel_type`](replication-options-replica.md#sysvar_slave_parallel_type) (prior
  to MySQL 8.0.26). Starting with MySQL 8.0.27, these system
  variables also have appropriate defaults for multithreading.

  To disable parallel execution, set
  `replica_parallel_workers` to 1, in which
  case the replica uses one coordinator thread which reads
  transactions, and one worker thread which applies them,
  which means that transactions are applied sequentially. When
  `replica_parallel_workers` is equal to 1,
  the [`replica_parallel_type`](replication-options-replica.md#sysvar_replica_parallel_type)
  ([`slave_parallel_type`](replication-options-replica.md#sysvar_slave_parallel_type)) and
  [`replica_preserve_commit_order`](replication-options-replica.md#sysvar_replica_preserve_commit_order)
  ([`slave_preserve_commit_order`](replication-options-replica.md#sysvar_slave_preserve_commit_order))
  system variables have no effect and are ignored. If
  `replica_parallel_workers` is equal to 0
  while the [`CHANGE REPLICATION SOURCE
  TO`](change-replication-source-to.md "15.4.2.3 CHANGE REPLICATION SOURCE TO Statement") option
  [`GTID_ONLY`](change-replication-source-to.md#crs-opt-gtid_only) is enabled, the
  replica has one coordinator thread and one worker thread,
  exactly as if `replica_parallel_workers`
  had been set to 1. (`GTID_ONLY` is
  available in MySQL 8.0.27 and later.) With one parallel
  worker, the
  [`replica_preserve_commit_order`](replication-options-replica.md#sysvar_replica_preserve_commit_order)
  ([`slave_preserve_commit_order`](replication-options-replica.md#sysvar_slave_preserve_commit_order))
  system variable also has no effect.

  Setting
  [`replica_parallel_workers`](replication-options-replica.md#sysvar_replica_parallel_workers)
  has no immediate effect but rather applies to all subsequent
  [`START REPLICA`](start-replica.md "15.4.2.6 START REPLICA Statement") statements.

  Multithreaded replicas are supported by NDB Cluster
  beginning with NDB 8.0.33. (Previously,
  `NDB` silently ignored any setting for
  `replica_parallel_workers`.) See
  [Section 25.7.11, “NDB Cluster Replication Using the Multithreaded Applier”](mysql-cluster-replication-mta.md "25.7.11 NDB Cluster Replication Using the Multithreaded Applier"), for more
  information.

  Increasing the number of workers improves the potential for
  parallelism. Typically, this improves performance up to a
  certain point, beyond which increasing the number of workers
  reduces performance due to concurrency effects such as lock
  contention. The ideal number depends on both hardware and
  workload; it can be difficult to predict and typically has
  to be found by testing. Tables without primary keys, which
  always harm performance, may have even greater negative
  performance impact on replicas having
  `replica_parallel_workers` > 1; so make
  sure that all tables have primary keys before enabling this
  option.

  From MySQL 8.0.26, use
  [`replica_pending_jobs_size_max`](replication-options-replica.md#sysvar_replica_pending_jobs_size_max)
  in place of
  [`slave_pending_jobs_size_max`](replication-options-replica.md#sysvar_slave_pending_jobs_size_max),
  which is deprecated from that release. In releases before
  MySQL 8.0.26, use
  [`slave_pending_jobs_size_max`](replication-options-replica.md#sysvar_slave_pending_jobs_size_max).

  For multithreaded replicas, this variable sets the maximum
  amount of memory (in bytes) available to applier queues
  holding events not yet applied. Setting this variable has no
  effect on replicas for which multithreading is not enabled.
  Setting this variable has no immediate effect. The state of
  the variable applies on all subsequent
  [`START REPLICA`](start-replica.md "15.4.2.6 START REPLICA Statement") statements.

  The minimum possible value for this variable is 1024 bytes;
  the default is 128MB. The maximum possible value is
  18446744073709551615 (16 exbibytes). Values that are not
  exact multiples of 1024 bytes are rounded down to the next
  lower multiple of 1024 bytes prior to being stored.

  The value of this variable is a soft limit and can be set to
  match the normal workload. If an unusually large event
  exceeds this size, the transaction is held until all the
  worker threads have empty queues, and then processed. All
  subsequent transactions are held until the large transaction
  has been completed.

  From MySQL 8.0.26, use
  [`replica_preserve_commit_order`](replication-options-replica.md#sysvar_replica_preserve_commit_order)
  in place of
  [`slave_preserve_commit_order`](replication-options-replica.md#sysvar_slave_preserve_commit_order),
  which is deprecated from that release. In releases before
  MySQL 8.0.26, use
  [`slave_preserve_commit_order`](replication-options-replica.md#sysvar_slave_preserve_commit_order).

  For multithreaded replicas (replicas on which
  [`replica_parallel_workers`](replication-options-replica.md#sysvar_replica_parallel_workers) is
  set to a value greater than 0), setting
  [`replica_preserve_commit_order=ON`](replication-options-replica.md#sysvar_replica_preserve_commit_order)
  ensures that transactions are executed and committed on the
  replica in the same order as they appear in the
  replica's relay log. This prevents gaps in the sequence
  of transactions that have been executed from the
  replica's relay log, and preserves the same transaction
  history on the replica as on the source (with the
  limitations listed below). This variable has no effect on
  replicas for which multithreading is not enabled.

  Before MySQL 8.0.27, the default for this system variable is
  `OFF`, meaning that transactions may be
  committed out of order. From MySQL 8.0.27, multithreading is
  enabled by default for replica servers
  ([`replica_parallel_workers=4`](replication-options-replica.md#sysvar_replica_parallel_workers)
  by default), so
  [`replica_preserve_commit_order=ON`](replication-options-replica.md#sysvar_replica_preserve_commit_order)
  is the default, and the setting
  [`replica_parallel_type=LOGICAL_CLOCK`](replication-options-replica.md#sysvar_replica_parallel_type)
  is also the default. Also from MySQL 8.0.27, the setting for
  [`replica_preserve_commit_order`](replication-options-replica.md#sysvar_replica_preserve_commit_order)
  is ignored if
  [`replica_parallel_workers`](replication-options-replica.md#sysvar_replica_parallel_workers) is
  set to 1, because in that situation the order of
  transactions is preserved anyway.

  Binary logging and replica update logging are not required
  on the replica to set
  [`replica_preserve_commit_order=ON`](replication-options-replica.md#sysvar_replica_preserve_commit_order),
  and can be disabled if wanted. Setting
  [`replica_preserve_commit_order=ON`](replication-options-replica.md#sysvar_replica_preserve_commit_order)
  requires that
  [`replica_parallel_type`](replication-options-replica.md#sysvar_replica_parallel_type) is
  set to `LOGICAL_CLOCK`, which is
  *not* the default setting before MySQL
  8.0.27. Before changing the value of
  [`replica_preserve_commit_order`](replication-options-replica.md#sysvar_replica_preserve_commit_order)
  or [`replica_parallel_type`](replication-options-replica.md#sysvar_replica_parallel_type),
  the replication applier thread (for all replication channels
  if you are using multiple replication channels) must be
  stopped.

  When
  [`replica_preserve_commit_order=OFF`](replication-options-replica.md#sysvar_replica_preserve_commit_order)
  is set, the transactions that a multithreaded replica
  applies in parallel may commit out of order. Therefore,
  checking for the most recently executed transaction does not
  guarantee that all previous transactions from the source
  have been executed on the replica. There is a chance of gaps
  in the sequence of transactions that have been executed from
  the replica's relay log. This has implications for
  logging and recovery when using a multithreaded replica. See
  [Section 19.5.1.34, “Replication and Transaction Inconsistencies”](replication-features-transaction-inconsistencies.md "19.5.1.34 Replication and Transaction Inconsistencies")
  for more information.

  When
  [`replica_preserve_commit_order=ON`](replication-options-replica.md#sysvar_replica_preserve_commit_order)
  is set, the executing worker thread waits until all previous
  transactions are committed before committing. While a given
  thread is waiting for other worker threads to commit their
  transactions, it reports its status as `Waiting for
  preceding transaction to commit`. With this mode, a
  multithreaded replica never enters a state that the source
  was not in. This supports the use of replication for read
  scale-out. See
  [Section 19.4.5, “Using Replication for Scale-Out”](replication-solutions-scaleout.md "19.4.5 Using Replication for Scale-Out").

  Note

  - [`replica_preserve_commit_order=ON`](replication-options-replica.md#sysvar_replica_preserve_commit_order)
    does not prevent source binary log position lag, where
    `Exec_master_log_pos` is behind the
    position up to which transactions have been executed.
    See
    [Section 19.5.1.34, “Replication and Transaction Inconsistencies”](replication-features-transaction-inconsistencies.md "19.5.1.34 Replication and Transaction Inconsistencies").
  - [`replica_preserve_commit_order=ON`](replication-options-replica.md#sysvar_replica_preserve_commit_order)
    does not preserve the commit order and transaction
    history if the replica uses filters on its binary log,
    such as [`--binlog-do-db`](replication-options-binary-log.md#option_mysqld_binlog-do-db).
  - [`replica_preserve_commit_order=ON`](replication-options-replica.md#sysvar_replica_preserve_commit_order)
    does not preserve the order of non-transactional DML
    updates. These might commit before transactions that
    precede them in the relay log, which might result in
    gaps in the sequence of transactions that have been
    executed from the replica's relay log.
  - A limitation to preserving the commit order on the
    replica can occur if statement-based replication is in
    use, and both transactional and non-transactional
    storage engines participate in a non-XA transaction
    that is rolled back on the source. Normally, non-XA
    transactions that are rolled back on the source are
    not replicated to the replica, but in this particular
    situation, the transaction might be replicated to the
    replica. If this does happen, a multithreaded replica
    without binary logging does not handle the transaction
    rollback, so the commit order on the replica diverges
    from the relay log order of the transactions in that
    case.
  - *Group Replication—MySQL 9.2.0 and
    later*: When a group primary is receiving
    and applying transactions from an external source
    through an asynchronous channel and a new member joins
    the group,
    [`replica_preserve_commit_order=ON`](replication-options-replica.md#sysvar_replica_preserve_commit_order)
    is not guaranteed to respect the commit order of
    non-conflicting transactions. Because of this, there
    may be temporary states on the secondary that never
    existed on the source; since this occurs only with
    regard to non-conflicting transactions, there is no
    actual divergence.

  in place of
  [`slave_sql_verify_checksum`](replication-options-replica.md#sysvar_slave_sql_verify_checksum),
  which is deprecated from that release. In releases before

  [`slave_sql_verify_checksum`](replication-options-replica.md#sysvar_slave_sql_verify_checksum).

  [`slave_sql_verify_checksum`](replication-options-replica.md#sysvar_slave_sql_verify_checksum)
  causes the replication SQL (applier) thread to verify data
  using the checksums read from the relay log. In the event of
  a mismatch, the replica stops with an error. Setting this
  variable takes effect for all replication channels
  immediately, including running channels.

  Note

  The replication I/O (receiver)thread always reads

  [`slave_transaction_retries`](replication-options-replica.md#sysvar_slave_transaction_retries).

  [`replica_transaction_retries`](replication-options-replica.md#sysvar_replica_transaction_retries)
  sets the maximum number of times for replication SQL threads
  on a single-threaded or multithreaded replica to
  automatically retry failed transactions before stopping.
  Setting this variable takes effect for all replication
  channels immediately, including running channels. The
  default value is 10. Setting the variable to 0 disables
  automatic retrying of transactions.

  If a replication SQL thread fails to execute a transaction
  because of an [`InnoDB`](innodb-storage-engine.md "Chapter 17 The InnoDB Storage Engine") deadlock
  or because the transaction's execution time exceeded
  [`InnoDB`](innodb-storage-engine.md "Chapter 17 The InnoDB Storage Engine")'s
  [`innodb_lock_wait_timeout`](innodb-parameters.md#sysvar_innodb_lock_wait_timeout) or

  it automatically retries
  [`replica_transaction_retries`](replication-options-replica.md#sysvar_replica_transaction_retries)
  times before stopping with an error. Transactions with a
  non-temporary error are not retried.

  The Performance Schema table
  [`replication_applier_status`](performance-schema-replication-applier-status-table.md "29.12.11.3 The replication_applier_status Table")
  shows the number of retries that took place on each

  `COUNT_TRANSACTIONS_RETRIES` column. The
  Performance Schema table
  [`replication_applier_status_by_worker`](performance-schema-replication-applier-status-by-worker-table.md "29.12.11.5 The replication_applier_status_by_worker Table")
  shows detailed information on transaction retries by
  individual applier threads on a single-threaded or
  multithreaded replica, and identifies the errors that caused
  the last transaction and the transaction currently in
  progress to be reattempted.

  [`slave_type_conversions`](replication-options-replica.md#sysvar_slave_type_conversions).

  [`replica_type_conversions`](replication-options-replica.md#sysvar_replica_type_conversions)
  controls the type conversion mode in effect on the replica
  when using row-based replication. Its value is a
  comma-delimited set of zero or more elements from the list:
  `ALL_LOSSY`,
  `ALL_NON_LOSSY`,
  `ALL_SIGNED`,
  `ALL_UNSIGNED`. Set this variable to an
  empty string to disallow type conversions between the source
  and the replica. Setting this variable takes effect for all
  replication channels immediately, including running
  channels.

  Use shared locks, and avoid unnecessary lock acquisitions,
  to improve performance for semisynchronous replication. This
  setting and
  [`replication_sender_observe_commit_only`](replication-options-replica.md#sysvar_replication_sender_observe_commit_only)
  help as the number of replicas increases, because contention
  for locks can slow down performance. While this system
  variable is enabled, the semisynchronous replication plugin
  cannot be uninstalled, so you must disable the system
  variable before the uninstall can complete.

  This system variable can be enabled before or after
  installing the semisynchronous replication plugin, and can
  be enabled while replication is running. Semisynchronous
  replication source servers can also get performance benefits
  from enabling this system variable, because they use the
  same locking mechanisms as the replicas.

  [`replication_optimize_for_static_plugin_config`](replication-options-replica.md#sysvar_replication_optimize_for_static_plugin_config)
  can be enabled when Group Replication is in use on a server.
  In that scenario, it might benefit performance when there is
  contention for locks due to high workloads.

  in the output of [`SHOW
  REPLICAS`](show-replicas.md "15.7.7.33 SHOW REPLICAS Statement") on the source server. Leave the value
  unset if you do not want the replica to register itself with
  the source.

  Note

  It is not sufficient for the source to simply read the IP
  address of the replica server from the TCP/IP socket after
  the replica connects. Due to NAT and other routing issues,
  that IP may not be valid for connecting to the replica

  Although the name of this variable might imply otherwise,
  [`report_password`](replication-options-replica.md#sysvar_report_password) is not

  The [`rpl_read_size`](replication-options-replica.md#sysvar_rpl_read_size) system
  variable controls the minimum amount of data in bytes that
  is read from the binary log files and relay log files. If
  heavy disk I/O activity for these files is impeding
  performance for the database, increasing the read size might
  reduce file reads and I/O stalls when the file data is not
  currently cached by the operating system.

  The minimum and default value for
  [`rpl_read_size`](replication-options-replica.md#sysvar_rpl_read_size) is 8192
  bytes. The value must be a multiple of 4KB. Note that a
  buffer the size of this value is allocated for each thread
  that reads from the binary log and relay log files,
  including dump threads on sources and coordinator threads on
  replicas. Setting a large value might therefore have an
  impact on memory consumption for servers.

  should be used instead. In releases before MySQL 8.0.26, use
  [`slave_checkpoint_group`](replication-options-replica.md#sysvar_slave_checkpoint_group).

  [`slave_checkpoint_group`](replication-options-replica.md#sysvar_slave_checkpoint_group) sets
  the maximum number of transactions that can be processed by
  a multithreaded replica before a checkpoint operation is
  called to update its status as shown by
  [`SHOW REPLICA STATUS`](show-replica-status.md "15.7.7.35 SHOW REPLICA STATUS Statement"). Setting
  this variable has no effect on replicas for which
  multithreading is not enabled. Setting this variable has no
  immediate effect. The state of the variable applies on all
  subsequent [`START REPLICA`](start-replica.md "15.4.2.6 START REPLICA Statement")
  statements.

  Previously, multithreaded replicas were not supported by NDB
  Cluster, which silently ignored the setting for this
  variable. This restriction was lifted in MySQL 8.0.33.

  This variable works in combination with the
  [`slave_checkpoint_period`](replication-options-replica.md#sysvar_slave_checkpoint_period)
  system variable in such a way that, when either limit is
  exceeded, the checkpoint is executed and the counters
  tracking both the number of transactions and the time
  elapsed since the last checkpoint are reset.

  The minimum allowed value for this variable is 32, unless
  the server was built using
  [`-DWITH_DEBUG`](source-configuration-options.md#option_cmake_with_debug), in which case
  the minimum value is 1. The effective value is always a
  multiple of 8; you can set it to a value that is not such a
  multiple, but the server rounds it down to the next lower
  multiple of 8 before storing the value.
  (*Exception*: No such rounding is
  performed by the debug server.) Regardless of how the server
  was built, the default value is 512, and the maximum allowed
  value is 524280.

  should be used instead; prior to MySQL 8.0.26, use
  [`slave_checkpoint_period`](replication-options-replica.md#sysvar_slave_checkpoint_period).

  `slave_checkpoint_period` sets the maximum

  checkpoint operation is called to update the status of a
  multithreaded replica as shown by [`SHOW
  REPLICA STATUS`](show-replica-status.md "15.7.7.35 SHOW REPLICA STATUS Statement"). Setting this variable has no
  effect on replicas for which multithreading is not enabled.
  Setting this variable takes effect for all replication
  channels immediately, including running channels.

  Previously, multithreaded replicas were not supported by NDB

  should be used instead. In releases before MySQL 8.0.26, use
  [`slave_compressed_protocol`](replication-options-replica.md#sysvar_slave_compressed_protocol).

  [`slave_compressed_protocol`](replication-options-replica.md#sysvar_slave_compressed_protocol)
  controls whether to use compression of the source/replica
  connection protocol if both source and replica support it.
  If this variable is disabled (the default), connections are
  uncompressed. Changes to this variable take effect on
  subsequent connection attempts; this includes after issuing
  a [`START REPLICA`](start-replica.md "15.4.2.6 START REPLICA Statement") statement, as
  well as reconnections made by a running replication I/O
  (receiver) thread.

  Binary log transaction compression (available as of MySQL
  8.0.20), which is activated by the
  [`binlog_transaction_compression`](replication-options-binary-log.md#sysvar_binlog_transaction_compression)
  system variable, can also be used to save bandwidth. If you
  use binary log transaction compression in combination with
  protocol compression, protocol compression has less
  opportunity to act on the data, but can still compress
  headers and those events and transaction payloads that are
  uncompressed. For more information on binary log transaction
  compression, see
  [Section 7.4.4.5, “Binary Log Transaction Compression”](binary-log-transaction-compression.md "7.4.4.5 Binary Log Transaction Compression").

  As of MySQL 8.0.18, if
  [`slave_compressed_protocol`](replication-options-replica.md#sysvar_slave_compressed_protocol)
  is enabled, it takes precedence over any
  `SOURCE_COMPRESSION_ALGORITHMS` |
  `MASTER_COMPRESSION_ALGORITHMS` option

  TO`](change-master-to.md "15.4.2.1 CHANGE MASTER TO Statement") statement. In this case, connections to the
  source use `zlib` compression if both the
  source and replica support that algorithm. If
  [`slave_compressed_protocol`](replication-options-replica.md#sysvar_slave_compressed_protocol)
  is disabled, the value of
  `SOURCE_COMPRESSION_ALGORITHMS` |
  `MASTER_COMPRESSION_ALGORITHMS` applies.
  For more information, see
  [Section 6.2.8, “Connection Compression Control”](connection-compression-control.md "6.2.8 Connection Compression Control").

  As of MySQL 8.0.18, this system variable is deprecated. You
  should expect it to be removed in a future version of MySQL.

  [`replica_exec_mode`](replication-options-replica.md#sysvar_replica_exec_mode) should be
  used instead. In releases before MySQL 8.0.26, use
  [`slave_exec_mode`](replication-options-replica.md#sysvar_slave_exec_mode).

  [`slave_exec_mode`](replication-options-replica.md#sysvar_slave_exec_mode) controls
  how a replication thread resolves conflicts and errors
  during replication. `IDEMPOTENT` mode
  causes suppression of duplicate-key and no-key-found errors;
  `STRICT` means no such suppression takes
  place.

  `IDEMPOTENT` mode is intended for use in
  multi-source replication, circular replication, and some
  other special replication scenarios for NDB Cluster
  Replication. (See
  [Section 25.7.10, “NDB Cluster Replication: Bidirectional and Circular Replication”](mysql-cluster-replication-multi-source.md "25.7.10 NDB Cluster Replication: Bidirectional and Circular Replication"),
  and
  [Section 25.7.12, “NDB Cluster Replication Conflict Resolution”](mysql-cluster-replication-conflict-resolution.md "25.7.12 NDB Cluster Replication Conflict Resolution"),
  for more information.) NDB Cluster ignores any value
  explicitly set for
  [`slave_exec_mode`](replication-options-replica.md#sysvar_slave_exec_mode), and always
  treats it as `IDEMPOTENT`.

  In MySQL Server 8.0, `STRICT`
  mode is the default value.

  Setting this variable takes immediate effect for all
  replication channels, including running channels.

  For storage engines other than
  [`NDB`](mysql-cluster.md "Chapter 25 MySQL NDB Cluster 8.0"),
  *`IDEMPOTENT` mode should be used
  only when you are absolutely sure that duplicate-key errors
  and key-not-found errors can safely be ignored*.
  It is meant to be used in fail-over scenarios for NDB
  Cluster where multi-source replication or circular
  replication is employed, and is not recommended for use in
  other cases.

  From MySQL 8.0.26,
  [`slave_load_tmpdir`](replication-options-replica.md#sysvar_slave_load_tmpdir) is
  deprecated and the alias
  [`replica_load_tmpdir`](replication-options-replica.md#sysvar_replica_load_tmpdir) should
  be used instead. In releases before MySQL 8.0.26, use
  [`slave_load_tmpdir`](replication-options-replica.md#sysvar_slave_load_tmpdir).

  [`slave_load_tmpdir`](replication-options-replica.md#sysvar_slave_load_tmpdir) specifies
  the name of the directory where the replica creates
  temporary files. Setting this variable takes effect for all
  replication channels immediately, including running
  channels. The variable value is by default equal to the
  value of the [`tmpdir`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_tmpdir) system
  variable, or the default that applies when that system
  variable is not specified.

  When the replication SQL thread replicates a
  [`LOAD DATA`](load-data.md "15.2.9 LOAD DATA Statement") statement, it
  extracts the file to be loaded from the relay log into
  temporary files, and then loads these into the table. If the
  file loaded on the source is huge, the temporary files on
  the replica are huge, too. Therefore, it might be advisable
  to use this option to tell the replica to put temporary
  files in a directory located in some file system that has a
  lot of available space. In that case, the relay logs are
  huge as well, so you might also want to set the
  [`relay_log`](replication-options-replica.md#sysvar_relay_log) system variable
  to place the relay logs in that file system.

  The directory specified by this option should be located in
  a disk-based file system (not a memory-based file system) so
  that the temporary files used to replicate
  [`LOAD DATA`](load-data.md "15.2.9 LOAD DATA Statement") statements can
  survive machine restarts. The directory also should not be
  one that is cleared by the operating system during the
  system startup process. However, replication can now
  continue after a restart if the temporary files have been
  removed.

  From MySQL 8.0.26,
  [`slave_max_allowed_packet`](replication-options-replica.md#sysvar_slave_max_allowed_packet) is
  deprecated and the alias
  [`replica_max_allowed_packet`](replication-options-replica.md#sysvar_replica_max_allowed_packet)
  should be used instead. In releases before MySQL 8.0.26, use
  [`slave_max_allowed_packet`](replication-options-replica.md#sysvar_slave_max_allowed_packet).

  [`slave_max_allowed_packet`](replication-options-replica.md#sysvar_slave_max_allowed_packet)
  sets the maximum packet size in bytes that the replication
  SQL (applier) and I/O (receiver) threads can handle. Setting
  this variable takes effect for all replication channels
  immediately, including running channels. It is possible for
  a source to write binary log events longer than its
  [`max_allowed_packet`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_max_allowed_packet) setting
  once the event header is added. The setting for
  [`slave_max_allowed_packet`](replication-options-replica.md#sysvar_slave_max_allowed_packet)
  must be larger than the
  [`max_allowed_packet`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_max_allowed_packet) setting
  on the source, so that large updates using row-based
  replication do not cause replication to fail.

  This global variable always has a value that is a positive
  integer multiple of 1024; if you set it to some value that
  is not, the value is rounded down to the next highest
  multiple of 1024 for it is stored or used; setting
  `slave_max_allowed_packet` to 0 causes 1024
  to be used. (A truncation warning is issued in all such
  cases.) The default and maximum value is 1073741824 (1 GB);
  the minimum is 1024.

  From MySQL 8.0.26,
  [`slave_net_timeout`](replication-options-replica.md#sysvar_slave_net_timeout) is
  deprecated and the alias
  [`replica_net_timeout`](replication-options-replica.md#sysvar_replica_net_timeout) should
  be used instead. In releases before MySQL 8.0.26, use
  [`slave_net_timeout`](replication-options-replica.md#sysvar_slave_net_timeout).

  [`slave_net_timeout`](replication-options-replica.md#sysvar_slave_net_timeout) specifies
  the number of seconds to wait for more data or a heartbeat
  signal from the source before the replica considers the
  connection broken, aborts the read, and tries to reconnect.
  Setting this variable has no immediate effect. The state of
  the variable applies on all subsequent
  [`START REPLICA`](start-replica.md "15.4.2.6 START REPLICA Statement") commands.

  The default value is 60 seconds (one minute). The first
  retry occurs immediately after the timeout. The interval
  between retries is controlled by the
  `SOURCE_CONNECT_RETRY` |
  `MASTER_CONNECT_RETRY` option for the
  [`CHANGE REPLICATION SOURCE TO`](change-replication-source-to.md "15.4.2.3 CHANGE REPLICATION SOURCE TO Statement")
  | [`CHANGE MASTER TO`](change-master-to.md "15.4.2.1 CHANGE MASTER TO Statement") statement,
  and the number of reconnection attempts is limited by the
  `SOURCE_RETRY_COUNT` |
  `MASTER_RETRY_COUNT` option.

  The heartbeat interval, which stops the connection timeout
  occurring in the absence of data if the connection is still
  good, is controlled by the
  `SOURCE_HEARTBEAT_PERIOD` |
  `MASTER_HEARTBEAT_PERIOD` option for the
  [`CHANGE REPLICATION SOURCE TO`](change-replication-source-to.md "15.4.2.3 CHANGE REPLICATION SOURCE TO Statement")
  | [`CHANGE MASTER TO`](change-master-to.md "15.4.2.1 CHANGE MASTER TO Statement") statement.
  The heartbeat interval defaults to half the value of
  [`slave_net_timeout`](replication-options-replica.md#sysvar_slave_net_timeout), and it
  is recorded in the replica's connection metadata repository
  and shown in the
  [`replication_connection_configuration`](performance-schema-replication-connection-configuration-table.md "29.12.11.10 The replication_connection_configuration Table")
  Performance Schema table. Note that a change to the value or
  default setting of
  [`slave_net_timeout`](replication-options-replica.md#sysvar_slave_net_timeout) does not
  automatically change the heartbeat interval, whether that
  has been set explicitly or is using a previously calculated
  default. If the connection timeout is changed, you must also
  issue [`CHANGE REPLICATION SOURCE
  TO`](change-replication-source-to.md "15.4.2.3 CHANGE REPLICATION SOURCE TO Statement") | [`CHANGE MASTER
  TO`](change-master-to.md "15.4.2.1 CHANGE MASTER TO Statement") to adjust the heartbeat interval to an
  appropriate value so that it occurs before the connection
  timeout.

  From MySQL 8.0.26,
  [`slave_parallel_type`](replication-options-replica.md#sysvar_slave_parallel_type) is
  deprecated and the alias
  [`replica_parallel_type`](replication-options-replica.md#sysvar_replica_parallel_type)
  should be used instead. In releases before MySQL 8.0.26, use
  [`slave_parallel_type`](replication-options-replica.md#sysvar_slave_parallel_type).

  For multithreaded replicas (replicas on which
  [`replica_parallel_workers`](replication-options-replica.md#sysvar_replica_parallel_workers) or
  [`slave_parallel_workers`](replication-options-replica.md#sysvar_slave_parallel_workers) is
  set to a value greater than 0),
  [`slave_parallel_type`](replication-options-replica.md#sysvar_slave_parallel_type)
  specifies the policy used to decide which transactions are
  allowed to execute in parallel on the replica. The variable
  has no effect on replicas for which multithreading is not
  enabled. The possible values are:

  - `LOGICAL_CLOCK`: Transactions that are
    part of the same binary log group commit on a source are
    applied in parallel on a replica. The dependencies
    between transactions are tracked based on their
    timestamps to provide additional parallelization where
    possible. When this value is set, the
    [`binlog_transaction_dependency_tracking`](replication-options-binary-log.md#sysvar_binlog_transaction_dependency_tracking)
    system variable can be used on the source to specify
    that write sets are used for parallelization in place of
    timestamps, if a write set is available for the
    transaction and gives improved results compared to
    timestamps.
  - `DATABASE`: Transactions that update
    different databases are applied in parallel. This value
    is only appropriate if data is partitioned into multiple
    databases which are being updated independently and
    concurrently on the source. There must be no
    cross-database constraints, as such constraints may be
    violated on the replica.

  When
  [`replica_preserve_commit_order=ON`](replication-options-replica.md#sysvar_replica_preserve_commit_order)
  or
  [`slave_preserve_commit_order`](replication-options-replica.md#sysvar_slave_preserve_commit_order)
  is `ON`, you must use
  `LOGICAL_CLOCK`. Before MySQL 8.0.27,
  `DATABASE` is the default. From MySQL
  8.0.27, multithreading is enabled by default for replica
  servers
  ([`replica_parallel_workers=4`](replication-options-replica.md#sysvar_replica_parallel_workers)
  by default), so `LOGICAL_CLOCK` is the
  default, and the setting
  [`replica_preserve_commit_order=ON`](replication-options-replica.md#sysvar_replica_preserve_commit_order)
  is also the default.

  All replication applier threads must be stopped prior to
  setting
  [`slave_parallel_type`](replication-options-replica.md#sysvar_slave_parallel_type).

  When your replication topology uses multiple levels of
  replicas, `LOGICAL_CLOCK` may achieve less
  parallelization for each level the replica is away from the
  source. You can reduce this effect by using
  [`binlog_transaction_dependency_tracking`](replication-options-binary-log.md#sysvar_binlog_transaction_dependency_tracking)
  on the source to specify that write sets are used instead of
  timestamps for parallelization where possible.

  When binary log transaction compression is enabled using the
  [`binlog_transaction_compression`](replication-options-binary-log.md#sysvar_binlog_transaction_compression)
  system variable, if
  [`replica_parallel_type`](replication-options-replica.md#sysvar_replica_parallel_type) or
  [`slave_parallel_type`](replication-options-replica.md#sysvar_slave_parallel_type) is set
  to `DATABASE`, all the databases affected
  by the transaction are mapped before the transaction is
  scheduled. The use of binary log transaction compression
  with the `DATABASE` policy can reduce
  parallelism compared to uncompressed transactions, which are
  mapped and scheduled for each event.

  From MySQL 8.0.26,
  [`slave_parallel_workers`](replication-options-replica.md#sysvar_slave_parallel_workers) is
  deprecated and the alias
  [`replica_parallel_workers`](replication-options-replica.md#sysvar_replica_parallel_workers)
  should be used instead. In releases before MySQL 8.0.26, use
  [`slave_parallel_workers`](replication-options-replica.md#sysvar_slave_parallel_workers).

  [`slave_parallel_workers`](replication-options-replica.md#sysvar_slave_parallel_workers)
  enables multithreading on the replica and sets the number of
  applier threads for executing replication transactions in
  parallel. When the value is a number greater than 0, the
  replica is a multithreaded replica with the specified number
  of applier threads, plus a coordinator thread to manage
  them. If you are using multiple replication channels, each
  channel has this number of threads.

  Before MySQL 8.0.27, the default for this system variable is
  0, so replicas are not multithreaded by default. From MySQL
  8.0.27, the default is 4, so replicas are multithreaded by
  default.

  Retrying of transactions is supported when multithreading is
  enabled on a replica. When
  [`replica_preserve_commit_order=ON`](replication-options-replica.md#sysvar_replica_preserve_commit_order)
  or
  [`slave_preserve_commit_order=ON`](replication-options-replica.md#sysvar_slave_preserve_commit_order)
  is set,
  transactions on a replica are externalized on the replica in
  the same order as they appear in the replica's relay log.
  The way in which transactions are distributed among applier
  threads is configured by
  [`replica_parallel_type`](replication-options-replica.md#sysvar_replica_parallel_type) (from
  MySQL 8.0.26) or
  [`slave_parallel_type`](replication-options-replica.md#sysvar_slave_parallel_type) (before
  MySQL 8.0.26). From MySQL 8.0.27, these system variables
  also have appropriate defaults for multithreading.

  To disable parallel execution, set
  [`replica_parallel_workers`](replication-options-replica.md#sysvar_replica_parallel_workers) to
  0, which gives the replica a single applier thread and no
  coordinator thread. With this setting, the
  [`replica_parallel_type`](replication-options-replica.md#sysvar_replica_parallel_type) or
  [`slave_parallel_type`](replication-options-replica.md#sysvar_slave_parallel_type) and
  [`replica_preserve_commit_order`](replication-options-replica.md#sysvar_replica_preserve_commit_order)
  or
  [`slave_preserve_commit_order`](replication-options-replica.md#sysvar_slave_preserve_commit_order)
  system variables have no effect and are ignored. From MySQL
  8.0.27, if parallel execution is disabled when the
  [`CHANGE REPLICATION SOURCE TO`](change-replication-source-to.md "15.4.2.3 CHANGE REPLICATION SOURCE TO Statement")
  option `GTID_ONLY` is enabled on a replica,
  the replica actually uses one parallel worker to take
  advantage of the method for retrying transactions without
  accessing the file positions. With one parallel worker, the
  [`replica_preserve_commit_order`](replication-options-replica.md#sysvar_replica_preserve_commit_order)
  ([`slave_preserve_commit_order`](replication-options-replica.md#sysvar_slave_preserve_commit_order))
  system variable also has no effect.

  Setting
  [`replica_parallel_workers`](replication-options-replica.md#sysvar_replica_parallel_workers)
  has no immediate effect. The state of the variable applies
  on all subsequent [`START
  REPLICA`](start-replica.md "15.4.2.6 START REPLICA Statement") statements.

  Previously, multithreaded replicas were not supported by NDB
  Cluster, which silently ignored the setting for this
  variable. This restriction was lifted in MySQL 8.0.33.

  is deprecated and the alias
  [`replica_pending_jobs_size_max`](replication-options-replica.md#sysvar_replica_pending_jobs_size_max)
  should be used instead. In releases before MySQL 8.0.26, use
  [`slave_pending_jobs_size_max`](replication-options-replica.md#sysvar_slave_pending_jobs_size_max).

  For multithreaded replicas, this variable sets the maximum
  amount of memory (in bytes) available to applier queues
  holding events not yet applied. Setting this variable has no
  effect on replicas for which multithreading is not enabled.
  Setting this variable has no immediate effect. The state of
  the variable applies on all subsequent
  [`START REPLICA`](start-replica.md "15.4.2.6 START REPLICA Statement") commands.

  The minimum possible value for this variable is 1024 bytes;
  the default is 128MB. The maximum possible value is
  18446744073709551615 (16 exbibytes). Values that are not
  exact multiples of 1024 bytes are rounded down to the next
  lower multiple of 1024 bytes prior to being stored.

  The value of this variable is a soft limit and can be set to
  match the normal workload. If an unusually large event
  exceeds this size, the transaction is held until all the
  worker threads have empty queues, and then processed. All
  subsequent transactions are held until the large transaction
  has been completed.

  From MySQL 8.0.26,
  [`slave_preserve_commit_order`](replication-options-replica.md#sysvar_slave_preserve_commit_order)
  is deprecated and the alias
  [`replica_preserve_commit_order`](replication-options-replica.md#sysvar_replica_preserve_commit_order)
  should be used instead. In releases before MySQL 8.0.26, use
  [`slave_preserve_commit_order`](replication-options-replica.md#sysvar_slave_preserve_commit_order).

  For multithreaded replicas (replicas on which
  [`replica_parallel_workers`](replication-options-replica.md#sysvar_replica_parallel_workers) or
  [`slave_parallel_workers`](replication-options-replica.md#sysvar_slave_parallel_workers) is
  set to a value greater than 0), setting
  [`slave_preserve_commit_order=1`](replication-options-replica.md#sysvar_slave_preserve_commit_order)
  ensures that transactions are executed and committed on the
  replica in the same order as they appear in the
  replica's relay log. This prevents gaps in the sequence
  of transactions that have been executed from the replica's
  relay log, and preserves the same transaction history on the
  replica as on the source (with the limitations listed
  below). This variable has no effect on replicas for which
  multithreading is not enabled.

  Before MySQL 8.0.27, the default for this system variable is
  `OFF`, meaning that transactions may be
  committed out of order. From MySQL 8.0.27, multithreading is
  enabled by default for replica servers
  ([`replica_parallel_workers=4`](replication-options-replica.md#sysvar_replica_parallel_workers)
  by default), so
  [`slave_preserve_commit_order=ON`](replication-options-replica.md#sysvar_slave_preserve_commit_order)
  is the default, and the setting
  [`slave_parallel_type=LOGICAL_CLOCK`](replication-options-replica.md#sysvar_slave_parallel_type)
  is also the default. Also from MySQL 8.0.27, the setting for
  [`slave_preserve_commit_order`](replication-options-replica.md#sysvar_slave_preserve_commit_order)
  is ignored if
  [`slave_parallel_workers`](replication-options-replica.md#sysvar_slave_parallel_workers) is
  set to 1, because in that situation the order of
  transactions is preserved anyway.

  Up to and including MySQL 8.0.18, setting
  [`slave_preserve_commit_order=ON`](replication-options-replica.md#sysvar_slave_preserve_commit_order)
  requires that binary logging
  ([`log_bin`](replication-options-binary-log.md#sysvar_log_bin)) and replica
  update logging
  ([`log_slave_updates`](replication-options-binary-log.md#sysvar_log_slave_updates)) are
  enabled on the replica, which are the default settings from
  MySQL 8.0. From MySQL 8.0.19, binary logging and replica
  update logging are not required on the replica to set
  [`slave_preserve_commit_order=ON`](replication-options-replica.md#sysvar_slave_preserve_commit_order),
  and can be disabled if wanted. In all releases, setting
  [`slave_preserve_commit_order=ON`](replication-options-replica.md#sysvar_slave_preserve_commit_order)
  requires that
  [`slave_parallel_type`](replication-options-replica.md#sysvar_slave_parallel_type) is set
  to `LOGICAL_CLOCK`, which is
  *not* the default setting before MySQL
  8.0.27. Before changing the value of
  [`slave_preserve_commit_order`](replication-options-replica.md#sysvar_slave_preserve_commit_order)
  or [`slave_parallel_type`](replication-options-replica.md#sysvar_slave_parallel_type), the
  replication applier thread (for all replication channels if
  you are using multiple replication channels) must be
  stopped.

  When
  [`slave_preserve_commit_order=OFF`](replication-options-replica.md#sysvar_slave_preserve_commit_order)
  is set, which is the default, the transactions that a
  multithreaded replica applies in parallel may commit out of
  order. Therefore, checking for the most recently executed
  transaction does not guarantee that all previous
  transactions from the source have been executed on the
  replica. There is a chance of gaps in the sequence of
  transactions that have been executed from the replica's
  relay log. This has implications for logging and recovery
  when using a multithreaded replica. See
  [Section 19.5.1.34, “Replication and Transaction Inconsistencies”](replication-features-transaction-inconsistencies.md "19.5.1.34 Replication and Transaction Inconsistencies")
  for more information.

  When
  [`slave_preserve_commit_order`](replication-options-replica.md#sysvar_slave_preserve_commit_order)
  is `ON`, the executing worker thread waits
  until all previous transactions are committed before
  committing. While a given thread is waiting for other worker
  threads to commit their transactions, it reports its status
  as `Waiting for preceding transaction to
  commit`. With this mode, a multithreaded replica
  never enters a state that the source was not in. This
  supports the use of replication for read scale-out. See
  [Section 19.4.5, “Using Replication for Scale-Out”](replication-solutions-scaleout.md "19.4.5 Using Replication for Scale-Out").

  Note

  - [`slave_preserve_commit_order=ON`](replication-options-replica.md#sysvar_slave_preserve_commit_order)
    does not prevent source binary log position lag, where
    `Exec_master_log_pos` is behind the
    position up to which transactions have been executed.
    See
    [Section 19.5.1.34, “Replication and Transaction Inconsistencies”](replication-features-transaction-inconsistencies.md "19.5.1.34 Replication and Transaction Inconsistencies").
  - [`slave_preserve_commit_order=ON`](replication-options-replica.md#sysvar_slave_preserve_commit_order)
    does not preserve the commit order and transaction
    history if the replica uses filters on its binary log,
    such as [`--binlog-do-db`](replication-options-binary-log.md#option_mysqld_binlog-do-db).
  - [`slave_preserve_commit_order=ON`](replication-options-replica.md#sysvar_slave_preserve_commit_order)
    does not preserve the order of non-transactional DML
    updates. These might commit before transactions that
    precede them in the relay log, which might result in
    gaps in the sequence of transactions that have been
    executed from the replica's relay log.
  - In releases before MySQL 8.0.19,
    [`slave_preserve_commit_order=ON`](replication-options-replica.md#sysvar_slave_preserve_commit_order)
    does not preserve the order of statements with an
    `IF EXISTS` clause when the object
    concerned does not exist. These might commit before
    transactions that precede them in the relay log, which
    might result in gaps in the sequence of transactions
    that have been executed from the replica's relay log.
  - A limitation to preserving the commit order on the
    replica can occur if statement-based replication is in
    use, and both transactional and non-transactional
    storage engines participate in a non-XA transaction
    that is rolled back on the source. Normally, non-XA
    transactions that are rolled back on the source are
    not replicated to the replica, but in this particular
    situation, the transaction might be replicated to the
    replica. If this does happen, a multithreaded replica
    without binary logging does not handle the transaction
    rollback, so the commit order on the replica diverges
    from the relay log order of the transactions in that
    case.

  From MySQL 8.0.26, use
  [`replica_skip_errors`](replication-options-replica.md#sysvar_replica_skip_errors) in
  place of [`slave_skip_errors`](replication-options-replica.md#sysvar_slave_skip_errors),
  which is deprecated from that release. In releases before
  MySQL 8.0.26, use
  [`slave_skip_errors`](replication-options-replica.md#sysvar_slave_skip_errors).

  Normally, replication stops when an error occurs on the
  replica, which gives you the opportunity to resolve the
  inconsistency in the data manually. This variable causes the
  replication SQL thread to continue replication when a
  statement returns any of the errors listed in the variable
  value.

  From MySQL 8.0.26,
  [`slave_sql_verify_checksum`](replication-options-replica.md#sysvar_slave_sql_verify_checksum)
  is deprecated and the alias
  [`replica_sql_verify_checksum`](replication-options-replica.md#sysvar_replica_sql_verify_checksum)
  should be used instead. In releases before MySQL 8.0.26, use
  [`slave_sql_verify_checksum`](replication-options-replica.md#sysvar_slave_sql_verify_checksum).

  [`slave_sql_verify_checksum`](replication-options-replica.md#sysvar_slave_sql_verify_checksum)
  causes the replication SQL thread to verify data using the
  checksums read from the relay log. In the event of a
  mismatch, the replica stops with an error. Setting this
  variable takes effect for all replication channels
  immediately, including running channels.

  Note

  The replication I/O (receiver) thread always reads
  checksums if possible when accepting events from over the
  network.

  From MySQL 8.0.26,
  [`slave_transaction_retries`](replication-options-replica.md#sysvar_slave_transaction_retries)
  is deprecated and the alias
  [`replica_transaction_retries`](replication-options-replica.md#sysvar_replica_transaction_retries)
  should be used instead. In releases before MySQL 8.0.26, use
  [`slave_transaction_retries`](replication-options-replica.md#sysvar_slave_transaction_retries).

  [`slave_transaction_retries`](replication-options-replica.md#sysvar_slave_transaction_retries)
  sets the maximum number of times for replication SQL threads
  on a single-threaded or multithreaded replica to
  automatically retry failed transactions before stopping.
  Setting this variable takes effect for all replication
  channels immediately, including running channels. The
  default value is 10. Setting the variable to 0 disables
  automatic retrying of transactions.

  If a replication SQL thread fails to execute a transaction
  because of an [`InnoDB`](innodb-storage-engine.md "Chapter 17 The InnoDB Storage Engine") deadlock
  or because the transaction's execution time exceeded
  [`InnoDB`](innodb-storage-engine.md "Chapter 17 The InnoDB Storage Engine")'s
  [`innodb_lock_wait_timeout`](innodb-parameters.md#sysvar_innodb_lock_wait_timeout) or
  [`NDB`](mysql-cluster.md "Chapter 25 MySQL NDB Cluster 8.0")'s
  [`TransactionDeadlockDetectionTimeout`](mysql-cluster-ndbd-definition.md#ndbparam-ndbd-transactiondeadlockdetectiontimeout)
  or
  [`TransactionInactiveTimeout`](mysql-cluster-ndbd-definition.md#ndbparam-ndbd-transactioninactivetimeout),
  it automatically retries
  [`slave_transaction_retries`](replication-options-replica.md#sysvar_slave_transaction_retries)
  times before stopping with an error. Transactions with a
  non-temporary error are not retried.

  The Performance Schema table
  [`replication_applier_status`](performance-schema-replication-applier-status-table.md "29.12.11.3 The replication_applier_status Table")
  shows the number of retries that took place on each
  replication channel, in the
  `COUNT_TRANSACTIONS_RETRIES` column. The
  Performance Schema table
  [`replication_applier_status_by_worker`](performance-schema-replication-applier-status-by-worker-table.md "29.12.11.5 The replication_applier_status_by_worker Table")
  shows detailed information on transaction retries by
  individual applier threads on a single-threaded or
  multithreaded replica, and identifies the errors that caused
  the last transaction and the transaction currently in
  progress to be reattempted.

  From MySQL 8.0.26,
  [`slave_type_conversions`](replication-options-replica.md#sysvar_slave_type_conversions) is
  deprecated and the alias
  [`replica_type_conversions`](replication-options-replica.md#sysvar_replica_type_conversions)
  should be used instead. In releases before MySQL 8.0.26, use
  [`slave_type_conversions`](replication-options-replica.md#sysvar_slave_type_conversions).

  [`slave_type_conversions`](replication-options-replica.md#sysvar_slave_type_conversions)
  controls the type conversion mode in effect on the replica
  when using row-based replication. Its value is a
  comma-delimited set of zero or more elements from the list:
  `ALL_LOSSY`,
  `ALL_NON_LOSSY`,
  `ALL_SIGNED`,
  `ALL_UNSIGNED`. Set this variable to an
  empty string to disallow type conversions between the source
  and the replica. Setting this variable takes effect for all
  replication channels immediately, including running
  channels.

  For additional information on type conversion modes
  applicable to attribute promotion and demotion in row-based
  replication, see
  [Row-based replication: attribute promotion and demotion](replication-features-differing-tables.md#replication-features-attribute-promotion "Row-based replication: attribute promotion and demotion").

  which is deprecated from that release. In releases before
  MySQL 8.0.26, use
  [`sql_slave_skip_counter`](replication-options-replica.md#sysvar_sql_slave_skip_counter).

  [`sql_replica_skip_counter`](replication-options-replica.md#sysvar_sql_replica_skip_counter)
  specifies the number of events from the source that a
  replica should skip. Setting the option has no immediate
  effect. The variable applies to the next
  [`START REPLICA`](start-replica.md "15.4.2.6 START REPLICA Statement") statement; the
  next [`START REPLICA`](start-replica.md "15.4.2.6 START REPLICA Statement") statement
  also changes the value back to 0. When this variable is set
  to a nonzero value and there are multiple replication
  channels configured, the [`START
  REPLICA`](start-replica.md "15.4.2.6 START REPLICA Statement") statement can only be used with the
  `FOR CHANNEL
  channel` clause.

  This option is incompatible with GTID-based replication, and
  must not be set to a nonzero value when
  [`gtid_mode=ON`](replication-options-gtids.md#sysvar_gtid_mode) is set. If you
  need to skip transactions when employing GTIDs, use
  [`gtid_executed`](replication-options-gtids.md#sysvar_gtid_executed) from the
  source instead. If you have enabled GTID assignment on a
  replication channel using the
  `ASSIGN_GTIDS_TO_ANONYMOUS_TRANSACTIONS`
  option of the [`CHANGE REPLICATION SOURCE
  TO`](change-replication-source-to.md "15.4.2.3 CHANGE REPLICATION SOURCE TO Statement") statement,

  available. See
  [Section 19.1.7.3, “Skipping Transactions”](replication-administration-skip.md "19.1.7.3 Skipping Transactions").

  Important

  If skipping the number of events specified by setting this
  variable would cause the replica to begin in the middle of
  an event group, the replica continues to skip until it
  finds the beginning of the next event group and begins
  from that point. For more information, see
  [Section 19.1.7.3, “Skipping Transactions”](replication-administration-skip.md "19.1.7.3 Skipping Transactions").

  [`sync_source_info`](replication-options-replica.md#sysvar_sync_source_info) should be
  used instead. In releases before MySQL 8.0.26, use
  [`sync_master_info`](replication-options-replica.md#sysvar_sync_master_info).

  [`sync_master_info`](replication-options-replica.md#sysvar_sync_master_info) specifies
  the number of events after which the replica updates the
  connection metadata repository. When the connection metadata
  repository is stored as an
  [`InnoDB`](innodb-storage-engine.md "Chapter 17 The InnoDB Storage Engine") table, which is the
  default from MySQL 8.0, it is updated after this number of
  events. If the connection metadata repository is stored as a
  file, which is deprecated from MySQL 8.0, the replica
  synchronizes its `master.info` file to disk
  (using `fdatasync()`) after this number of
  events. The default value is 10000, and a zero value means
  that the repository is never updated. Setting this variable
  takes effect for all replication channels immediately,
  including running channels.

  | Maximum Value | `4294967295` |

  If the value of this variable is greater than 0, the MySQL
  server synchronizes its relay log to disk (using
  `fdatasync()`) after every
  `sync_relay_log` events are written to the
  relay log. Setting this variable takes effect for all
  replication channels immediately, including running
  channels.

  Setting `sync_relay_log` to 0 causes no
  synchronization to be done to disk; in this case, the server
  relies on the operating system to flush the relay log's
  contents from time to time as for any other file.

  A value of 1 is the safest choice because in the event of an
  unexpected halt you lose at most one event from the relay
  log. However, it is also the slowest choice (unless the disk
  has a battery-backed cache, which makes synchronization very
  fast). For information on the combination of settings on a
  replica that is most resilient to unexpected halts, see
  [Section 19.4.2, “Handling an Unexpected Halt of a Replica”](replication-solutions-unexpected-replica-halt.md "19.4.2 Handling an Unexpected Halt of a Replica").

  The number of transactions after which the replica updates
  the applier metadata repository. When the applier metadata
  repository is stored as an
  [`InnoDB`](innodb-storage-engine.md "Chapter 17 The InnoDB Storage Engine") table (the default in
  MySQL 8.0 and later), it is updated after every transaction
  and this system variable is ignored. If the applier metadata
  repository is stored as a file (deprecated in MySQL 8.0),
  the replica synchronizes its
  `relay-log.info` file to disk (using
  `fdatasync()`) after this many
  transactions. `0` (zero) means that the
  file contents are flushed by the operating system only.
  Setting this variable takes effect for all replication
  channels immediately, including running channels.

  Since storing applier metadata as a file is deprecated, this
  variable is also deprecated; as of MySQL 8.0.34, the server
  raises a warning whenever you set it or read its value. You
  should expect `sync_relay_log_info` to be
  removed in a future version of MySQL, and migrate
  applications now that may depend on it.

  In MySQL 8.0.26, incompatible changes were made to
  instrumentation names containing the terms
  `master`, `slave`, and
  `mts` (for “Multi-Threaded
  Slave”), which were changed respectively to
  `source`, `replica`, and
  `mta` (for “Multi-Threaded
  Applier”). If these incompatible changes impact your
  applications, set the
  [`terminology_use_previous`](replication-options-replica.md#sysvar_terminology_use_previous)
  system variable to `BEFORE_8_0_26` to make
  MySQL Server use the old versions of the names for the
  objects specified in the previous list. This enables
  monitoring tools that rely on the old names to continue
  working until they can be updated to use the new names.

  Set the
  [`terminology_use_previous`](replication-options-replica.md#sysvar_terminology_use_previous)
  system variable with session scope to support individual
  users, or with global scope to be the default for all new
  sessions. When global scope is used, the slow query log
  contains the old versions of the names.

  The affected instrumentation names are given in the
  following list. The
  [`terminology_use_previous`](replication-options-replica.md#sysvar_terminology_use_previous)
  system variable only affects these items. It does not affect
  the new aliases for system variables, status variables, and
  command-line options that were also introduced in MySQL
  8.0.26, and these can still be used when it is set.
