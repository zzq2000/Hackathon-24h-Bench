### 20.9.2 Group Replication Status Variables

MySQL 8.0 supports one status variable providing
information about Group Replication. This variable is described
here:

- [`group_replication_primary_member`](group-replication-status-variables.md#statvar_group_replication_primary_member)

  Shows the primary member's UUID when the group is
  operating in single-primary mode. If the group is operating in
  multi-primary mode, this is an empty string.

  Warning

  The `group_replication_primary_member`
  status variable has been deprecated and is scheduled to be
  removed in a future version.

  See [Section 20.1.3.1.2, “Finding the Primary”](group-replication-single-primary-mode.md#group-replication-find-primary "20.1.3.1.2 Finding the Primary").
