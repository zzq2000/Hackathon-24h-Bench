#### 19.2.2.4 Replication Channel Naming Conventions

This section describes how naming conventions are impacted by
replication channels.

Each replication channel has a unique name which is a string with
a maximum length of 64 characters and is case-insensitive. Because
channel names are used in the replica's applier metadata
repository table, the character set used for these is always
UTF-8. Although you are generally free to use any name for
channels, the following names are reserved:

- `group_replication_applier`
- `group_replication_recovery`

The name you choose for a replication channel also influences the
file names used by a multi-source replica. The relay log files and
index files for each channel are named
`relay_log_basename-channel.xxxxxx`,
where *`relay_log_basename`* is a base name
specified using the [`relay_log`](replication-options-replica.md#sysvar_relay_log)
system variable, and *`channel`* is the
name of the channel logged to this file. If you do not specify the
[`relay_log`](replication-options-replica.md#sysvar_relay_log) system variable, a
default file name is used that also includes the name of the
channel.
