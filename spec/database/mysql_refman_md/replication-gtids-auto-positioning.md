#### 19.1.3.3 GTID Auto-Positioning

GTIDs replace the file-offset pairs previously required to
determine points for starting, stopping, or resuming the flow of
data between source and replica. When GTIDs are in use, all the
information that the replica needs for synchronizing with the
source is obtained directly from the replication data stream.

To start a replica using GTID-based replication, you need to
enable the `SOURCE_AUTO_POSITION` |
`MASTER_AUTO_POSITION` option in the
[`CHANGE REPLICATION SOURCE TO`](change-replication-source-to.md "15.4.2.3 CHANGE REPLICATION SOURCE TO Statement")
statement (from MySQL 8.0.23) or [`CHANGE
MASTER TO`](change-master-to.md "15.4.2.1 CHANGE MASTER TO Statement") statement (before MySQL 8.0.23). The
alternative `SOURCE_LOG_FILE` |
`MASTER_LOG_FILE` and
`SOURCE_LOG_POS` |
`MASTER_LOG_POS` options specify the name of the
log file and the starting position within the file, but with GTIDs
the replica does not need this nonlocal data.. For full
instructions to configure and start sources and replicas using
GTID-based replication, see
[Section 19.1.3.4, “Setting Up Replication Using GTIDs”](replication-gtids-howto.md "19.1.3.4 Setting Up Replication Using GTIDs").

The `SOURCE_AUTO_POSITION` |
`MASTER_AUTO_POSITION` option is disabled by
default. If multi-source replication is enabled on the replica,
you need to set the option for each applicable replication
channel. Disabling the `SOURCE_AUTO_POSITION` |
`MASTER_AUTO_POSITION` option again causes the
replica to revert to position-based replication; this means that,
when `GTID_ONLY=ON`, some positions may be marked
as invalid, in which case you must also specify both
`SOURCE_LOG_FILE` |
`MASTER_LOG_FILE` and
`SOURCE_LOG_POS` |
`MASTER_LOG_POS` when disabling
`SOURCE_AUTO_POSITION` |
`MASTER_AUTO_POSITION`.

When a replica has GTIDs enabled
([`GTID_MODE=ON`](replication-options-gtids.md#sysvar_gtid_mode),
`ON_PERMISSIVE,` or
`OFF_PERMISSIVE` ) and the
`MASTER_AUTO_POSITION` option enabled,
auto-positioning is activated for connection to the source. The
source must have [`GTID_MODE=ON`](replication-options-gtids.md#sysvar_gtid_mode) set
in order for the connection to succeed. In the initial handshake,
the replica sends a GTID set containing the transactions that it
has already received, committed, or both. This GTID set is equal
to the union of the set of GTIDs in the
[`gtid_executed`](replication-options-gtids.md#sysvar_gtid_executed) system variable
(`@@GLOBAL.gtid_executed`), and the set of GTIDs
recorded in the Performance Schema
[`replication_connection_status`](performance-schema-replication-connection-status-table.md "29.12.11.11 The replication_connection_status Table") table
as received transactions (the result of the statement
`SELECT RECEIVED_TRANSACTION_SET FROM
PERFORMANCE_SCHEMA.replication_connection_status`).

The source responds by sending all transactions recorded in its
binary log whose GTID is not included in the GTID set sent by the
replica. To do this, the source first identifies the appropriate
binary log file to begin working with, by checking the
`Previous_gtids_log_event` in the header of each
of its binary log files, starting with the most recent. When the
source finds the first `Previous_gtids_log_event`
which contains no transactions that the replica is missing, it
begins with that binary log file. This method is efficient and
only takes a significant amount of time if the replica is behind
the source by a large number of binary log files. The source then
reads the transactions in that binary log file and subsequent
files up to the current one, sending the transactions with GTIDs
that the replica is missing, and skipping the transactions that
were in the GTID set sent by the replica. The elapsed time until
the replica receives the first missing transaction depends on its
offset in the binary log file. This exchange ensures that the
source only sends the transactions with a GTID that the replica
has not already received or committed. If the replica receives
transactions from more than one source, as in the case of a
diamond topology, the auto-skip function ensures that the
transactions are not applied twice.

If any of the transactions that should be sent by the source have
been purged from the source's binary log, or added to the set of
GTIDs in the [`gtid_purged`](replication-options-gtids.md#sysvar_gtid_purged) system
variable by another method, the source sends the error
[`ER_SOURCE_HAS_PURGED_REQUIRED_GTIDS`](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/mysql-errors/8.0/en/server-error-reference.html#error_er_source_has_purged_required_gtids)
to the replica, and replication does not start. The GTIDs of the
missing purged transactions are identified and listed in the
source's error log in the warning message
[`ER_FOUND_MISSING_GTIDS`](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/mysql-errors/8.0/en/server-error-reference.html#error_er_found_missing_gtids). The
replica cannot recover automatically from this error because parts
of the transaction history that are needed to catch up with the
source have been purged. Attempting to reconnect without the
`MASTER_AUTO_POSITION` option enabled only
results in the loss of the purged transactions on the replica. The
correct approach to recover from this situation is for the replica
to replicate the missing transactions listed in the
[`ER_FOUND_MISSING_GTIDS`](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/mysql-errors/8.0/en/server-error-reference.html#error_er_found_missing_gtids) message
from another source, or for the replica to be replaced by a new
replica created from a more recent backup. Consider revising the
binary log expiration period
([`binlog_expire_logs_seconds`](replication-options-binary-log.md#sysvar_binlog_expire_logs_seconds)) on
the source to ensure that the situation does not occur again.

If during the exchange of transactions it is found that the
replica has received or committed transactions with the source's
UUID in the GTID, but the source itself does not have a record of
them, the source sends the error
[`ER_REPLICA_HAS_MORE_GTIDS_THAN_SOURCE`](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/mysql-errors/8.0/en/server-error-reference.html#error_er_replica_has_more_gtids_than_source)
to the replica and replication does not start. This situation can
occur if a source that does not have
[`sync_binlog=1`](replication-options-binary-log.md#sysvar_sync_binlog) set experiences a
power failure or operating system crash, and loses committed
transactions that have not yet been synchronized to the binary log
file, but have been received by the replica. The source and
replica can diverge if any clients commit transactions on the
source after it is restarted, which can lead to the situation
where the source and replica are using the same GTID for different
transactions. The correct approach to recover from this situation
is to check manually whether the source and replica have diverged.
If the same GTID is now in use for different transactions, you
either need to perform manual conflict resolution for individual
transactions as required, or remove either the source or the
replica from the replication topology. If the issue is only
missing transactions on the source, you can make the source into a
replica instead, allow it to catch up with the other servers in
the replication topology, and then make it a source again if
needed.

For a multi-source replica in a diamond topology (where the
replica replicates from two or more sources, which in turn
replicate from a common source), when GTID-based replication is in
use, ensure that any replication filters or other channel
configuration are identical on all channels on the multi-source
replica. With GTID-based replication, filters are applied only to
the transaction data, and GTIDs are not filtered out. This happens
so that a replica’s GTID set stays consistent with the
source’s, meaning GTID auto-positioning can be used without
re-acquiring filtered out transactions each time. In the case
where the downstream replica is multi-source and receives the same
transaction from multiple sources in a diamond topology, the
downstream replica now has multiple versions of the transaction,
and the result depends on which channel applies the transaction
first. The second channel to attempt it skips the transaction
using GTID auto-skip, because the transaction’s GTID was added
to the [`gtid_executed`](replication-options-gtids.md#sysvar_gtid_executed) set by the
first channel. With identical filtering on the channels, there is
no problem because all versions of the transaction contain the
same data, so the results are the same. However, with different
filtering on the channels, the database can become inconsistent
and replication can hang.
