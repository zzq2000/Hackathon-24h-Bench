There are several ways to specify options for MySQL programs:

- List the options on the command line following the program
  name. This is common for options that apply to a specific
  invocation of the program.
- List the options in an option file that the program reads when
  it starts. This is common for options that you want the
  program to use each time it runs.
- List the options in environment variables (see
  [Section 6.2.9, “Setting Environment Variables”](setting-environment-variables.md "6.2.9 Setting Environment Variables")). This method
  is useful for options that you want to apply each time the
  program runs. In practice, option files are used more commonly
  for this purpose, but [Section 7.8.3, “Running Multiple MySQL Instances on Unix”](multiple-unix-servers.md "7.8.3 Running Multiple MySQL Instances on Unix"),
  discusses one situation in which environment variables can be
  very helpful. It describes a handy technique that uses such
  variables to specify the TCP/IP port number and Unix socket
  file for the server and for client programs.

Options are processed in order, so if an option is specified
multiple times, the last occurrence takes precedence. The
following command causes [**mysql**](mysql.md "6.5.1 mysql — The MySQL Command-Line Client") to connect to
the server running on `localhost`:

```terminal
mysql -h example.com -h localhost
```

There is one exception: For [**mysqld**](mysqld.md "6.3.1 mysqld — The MySQL Server"), the
*first* instance of the
[`--user`](server-options.md#option_mysqld_user) option is used as a security
precaution, to prevent a user specified in an option file from
being overridden on the command line.

If conflicting or related options are given, later options take
precedence over earlier options. The following command runs
[**mysql**](mysql.md "6.5.1 mysql — The MySQL Command-Line Client") in “no column names” mode:

```terminal
mysql --column-names --skip-column-names
```

MySQL programs determine which options are given first by
examining environment variables, then by processing option files,
and then by checking the command line. Because later options take
precedence over earlier ones, the processing order means that
environment variables have the lowest precedence and command-line
options the highest.

For the server, one exception applies: The
**mysqld-auto.cnf** option file in the data
directory is processed last, so it takes precedence even over
command-line options.

You can take advantage of the way that MySQL programs process
options by specifying default option values for a program in an
option file. That enables you to avoid typing them each time you
run the program while enabling you to override the defaults if
necessary by using command-line options.
