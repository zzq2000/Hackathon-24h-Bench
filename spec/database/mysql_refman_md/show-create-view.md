#### 15.7.7.13 SHOW CREATE VIEW Statement

```sql
SHOW CREATE VIEW view_name
```

This statement shows the [`CREATE
VIEW`](create-view.md "15.1.23 CREATE VIEW Statement") statement that creates the named view.

```sql
mysql> SHOW CREATE VIEW v\G
*************************** 1. row ***************************
                View: v
         Create View: CREATE ALGORITHM=UNDEFINED
                      DEFINER=`bob`@`localhost`
                      SQL SECURITY DEFINER VIEW
                      `v` AS select 1 AS `a`,2 AS `b`
character_set_client: utf8mb4
collation_connection: utf8mb4_0900_ai_ci
```

`character_set_client` is the session value of
the [`character_set_client`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_character_set_client) system
variable when the view was created.
`collation_connection` is the session value of
the [`collation_connection`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_collation_connection) system
variable when the view was created.

Use of [`SHOW CREATE VIEW`](show-create-view.md "15.7.7.13 SHOW CREATE VIEW Statement") requires
the [`SHOW VIEW`](privileges-provided.md#priv_show-view) privilege, and the
[`SELECT`](privileges-provided.md#priv_select) privilege for the view in
question.

View information is also available from the
`INFORMATION_SCHEMA`
[`VIEWS`](information-schema-views-table.md "28.3.48 The INFORMATION_SCHEMA VIEWS Table") table. See
[Section 28.3.48, “The INFORMATION\_SCHEMA VIEWS Table”](information-schema-views-table.md "28.3.48 The INFORMATION_SCHEMA VIEWS Table").

MySQL lets you use different
[`sql_mode`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_sql_mode) settings to tell the
server the type of SQL syntax to support. For example, you might
use the [`ANSI`](sql-mode.md#sqlmode_ansi) SQL mode to
ensure MySQL correctly interprets the standard SQL concatenation
operator, the double bar (`||`), in your
queries. If you then create a view that concatenates items, you
might worry that changing the
[`sql_mode`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_sql_mode) setting to a value
different from [`ANSI`](sql-mode.md#sqlmode_ansi) could
cause the view to become invalid. But this is not the case. No
matter how you write out a view definition, MySQL always stores
it the same way, in a canonical form. Here is an example that
shows how the server changes a double bar concatenation operator
to a [`CONCAT()`](string-functions.md#function_concat) function:

```sql
mysql> SET sql_mode = 'ANSI';
Query OK, 0 rows affected (0.00 sec)

mysql> CREATE VIEW test.v AS SELECT 'a' || 'b' as col1;
Query OK, 0 rows affected (0.01 sec)

mysql> SHOW CREATE VIEW test.v\G
*************************** 1. row ***************************
                View: v
         Create View: CREATE VIEW "v" AS select concat('a','b') AS "col1"
...
1 row in set (0.00 sec)
```

The advantage of storing a view definition in canonical form is
that changes made later to the value of
[`sql_mode`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_sql_mode) do not affect the
results from the view. However an additional consequence is that
comments prior to [`SELECT`](select.md "15.2.13 SELECT Statement") are
stripped from the definition by the server.
