### 7.1.17 Server-Side Help Support

MySQL Server supports a [`HELP`](help.md "15.8.3 HELP Statement")
statement that returns information from the MySQL Reference Manual
(see [Section 15.8.3, “HELP Statement”](help.md "15.8.3 HELP Statement")). This information is stored in
several tables in the `mysql` schema (see
[Section 7.3, “The mysql System Schema”](system-schema.md "7.3 The mysql System Schema")). Proper operation of the
[`HELP`](help.md "15.8.3 HELP Statement") statement requires that these
help tables be initialized.

For a new installation of MySQL using a binary or source
distribution on Unix, help-table content initialization occurs
when you initialize the data directory (see
[Section 2.9.1, “Initializing the Data Directory”](data-directory-initialization.md "2.9.1 Initializing the Data Directory")). For an RPM
distribution on Linux or binary distribution on Windows, content
initialization occurs as part of the MySQL installation process.

For a MySQL upgrade using a binary distribution, help-table
content is upgraded automatically by the server as of MySQL
8.0.16. Prior to MySQL 8.0.16, the content is not upgraded
automatically, but you can upgrade it manually. Locate the
`fill_help_tables.sql` file in the
`share` or `share/mysql`
directory. Change location into that directory and process the
file with the [**mysql**](mysql.md "6.5.1 mysql — The MySQL Command-Line Client") client as follows:

```terminal
mysql -u root -p mysql < fill_help_tables.sql
```

The command shown here assumes that you connect to the server
using an account such as `root` that has
privileges for modifying tables in the `mysql`
schema. Adjust the connection parameters as required.

Prior to MySQL 8.0.16, if you are working with Git and a MySQL
development source tree, the source tree contains only a
“stub” version of
`fill_help_tables.sql`. To obtain a non-stub
copy, use one from a source or binary distribution.

Note

Each MySQL series has its own series-specific reference manual,
so help-table content is series specific as well. This has
implications for replication because help-table content should
match the MySQL series. If you load MySQL 8.0 help
content into a MySQL 8.0 replication server, it
does not make sense to replicate that content to a replica
server from a different MySQL series and for which that content
is not appropriate. For this reason, as you upgrade individual
servers in a replication scenario, you should upgrade each
server's help tables, using the instructions given earlier.
(Manual help-content upgrade is necessary only for replication
servers from versions lower than 8.0.16. As mentioned in the
preceding instructions, content upgrades occur automatically as
of MySQL 8.0.16.)
