#### 19.1.7.2 Pausing Replication on the Replica

You can stop and start replication on the replica using the
[`STOP REPLICA`](stop-replica.md "15.4.2.8 STOP REPLICA Statement") and
[`START REPLICA`](start-replica.md "15.4.2.6 START REPLICA Statement") statements. From
MySQL 8.0.22, [`STOP SLAVE`](stop-slave.md "15.4.2.9 STOP SLAVE Statement") and
[`START SLAVE`](start-slave.md "15.4.2.7 START SLAVE Statement") are deprecated, and
[`STOP REPLICA`](stop-replica.md "15.4.2.8 STOP REPLICA Statement") and
[`START REPLICA`](start-replica.md "15.4.2.6 START REPLICA Statement") are available to
use instead.

To stop processing of the binary log from the source, use
[`STOP REPLICA`](stop-replica.md "15.4.2.8 STOP REPLICA Statement"):

```sql
mysql> STOP SLAVE;
Or from MySQL 8.0.22:
mysql> STOP REPLICA;
```

When replication is stopped, the replication I/O (receiver)
thread stops reading events from the source binary log and
writing them to the relay log, and the SQL thread stops reading
events from the relay log and executing them. You can pause the
I/O (receiver) or SQL (applier) thread individually by
specifying the thread type:

```sql
mysql> STOP SLAVE IO_THREAD;
mysql> STOP SLAVE SQL_THREAD;
Or from MySQL 8.0.22:
mysql> STOP REPLICA IO_THREAD;
mysql> STOP REPLICA SQL_THREAD;
```

To start execution again, use the [`START
REPLICA`](start-replica.md "15.4.2.6 START REPLICA Statement") statement:

```sql
mysql> START SLAVE;
Or from MySQL 8.0.22:
mysql> START REPLICA;
```

To start a particular thread, specify the thread type:

```sql
mysql> START SLAVE IO_THREAD;
mysql> START SLAVE SQL_THREAD;
Or from MySQL 8.0.22:
mysql> START REPLICA IO_THREAD;
mysql> START REPLICA SQL_THREAD;
```

For a replica that performs updates only by processing events
from the source, stopping only the SQL thread can be useful if
you want to perform a backup or other task. The I/O (receiver)
thread continues to read events from the source but they are not
executed. This makes it easier for the replica to catch up when
you restart the SQL (applier) thread.

Stopping only the receiver thread enables the events in the
relay log to be executed by the applier thread up to the point
where the relay log ends. This can be useful when you want to
pause execution to catch up with events already received from
the source, when you want to perform administration on the
replica but also ensure that it has processed all updates to a
specific point. This method can also be used to pause event
receipt on the replica while you conduct administration on the
source. Stopping the receiver thread but permitting the applier
thread to run helps ensure that there is not a massive backlog
of events to be executed when replication is started again.
