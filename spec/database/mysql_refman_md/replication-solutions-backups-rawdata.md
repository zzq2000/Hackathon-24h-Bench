#### 19.4.1.2 Backing Up Raw Data from a Replica

To guarantee the integrity of the files that are copied, backing
up the raw data files on your MySQL replica should take place
while your replica server is shut down. If the MySQL server is
still running, background tasks may still be updating the
database files, particularly those involving storage engines
with background processes such as `InnoDB`.
With `InnoDB`, these problems should be
resolved during crash recovery, but since the replica server can
be shut down during the backup process without affecting the
execution of the source it makes sense to take advantage of this
capability.

To shut down the server and back up the files:

1. Shut down the replica MySQL server:

   ```terminal
   $> mysqladmin shutdown
   ```
2. Copy the data files. You can use any suitable copying or
   archive utility, including **cp**,
   **tar** or **WinZip**. For
   example, assuming that the data directory is located under
   the current directory, you can archive the entire directory
   as follows:

   ```terminal
   $> tar cf /tmp/dbbackup.tar ./data
   ```
3. Start the MySQL server again. Under Unix:

   ```terminal
   $> mysqld_safe &
   ```

   Under Windows:

   ```terminal
   C:\> "C:\Program Files\MySQL\MySQL Server 8.0\bin\mysqld"
   ```

Normally you should back up the entire data directory for the
replica MySQL server. If you want to be able to restore the data
and operate as a replica (for example, in the event of failure
of the replica), in addition to the data, you need to have the
replica's connection metadata repository and applier metadata
repository, and the relay log files. These items are needed to
resume replication after you restore the replica's data.
Assuming tables have been used for the replica's connection
metadata repository and applier metadata repository (see
[Section 19.2.4, “Relay Log and Replication Metadata Repositories”](replica-logs.md "19.2.4 Relay Log and Replication Metadata Repositories")), which is the default in MySQL
8.0, these tables are backed up along with the data
directory. If files have been used for the repositories, which
is deprecated, you must back these up separately. The relay log
files must be backed up separately if they have been placed in a
different location to the data directory.

If you lose the relay logs but still have the
`relay-log.info` file, you can check it to
determine how far the replication SQL thread has executed in the
source's binary logs. Then you can use
[`CHANGE REPLICATION SOURCE TO`](change-replication-source-to.md "15.4.2.3 CHANGE REPLICATION SOURCE TO Statement")
statement (from MySQL 8.0.23) or [`CHANGE
MASTER TO`](change-master-to.md "15.4.2.1 CHANGE MASTER TO Statement") statement (before MySQL 8.0.23) with the
`SOURCE_LOG_FILE` |
`MASTER_LOG_FILE` and
`SOURCE_LOG_POS` |
`MASTER_LOG_POS` options to tell the replica to
re-read the binary logs from that point. This requires that the
binary logs still exist on the source server.

If your replica is replicating [`LOAD
DATA`](load-data.md "15.2.9 LOAD DATA Statement") statements, you should also back up any
`SQL_LOAD-*` files that exist in the
directory that the replica uses for this purpose. The replica
needs these files to resume replication of any interrupted
[`LOAD DATA`](load-data.md "15.2.9 LOAD DATA Statement") operations. The
location of this directory is the value of the system variable
[`replica_load_tmpdir`](replication-options-replica.md#sysvar_replica_load_tmpdir) (from MySQL
8.0.26) or [`slave_load_tmpdir`](replication-options-replica.md#sysvar_slave_load_tmpdir)
(before MySQL 8.0.26). If the server was not started with that
variable set, the directory location is the value of the
[`tmpdir`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_tmpdir) system variable.
