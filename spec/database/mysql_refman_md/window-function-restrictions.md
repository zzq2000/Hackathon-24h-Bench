### 14.20.5 Window Function Restrictions

The SQL standard imposes a constraint on window functions that
they cannot be used in [`UPDATE`](update.md "15.2.17 UPDATE Statement") or
[`DELETE`](delete.md "15.2.2 DELETE Statement") statements to update rows.
Using such functions in a subquery of these statements (to
select rows) is permitted.

MySQL does not support these window function features:

- `DISTINCT` syntax for aggregate window
  functions.
- Nested window functions.
- Dynamic frame endpoints that depend on the value of the
  current row.

The parser recognizes these window constructs which nevertheless
are not supported:

- The `GROUPS` frame units specifier is
  parsed, but produces an error. Only `ROWS`
  and `RANGE` are supported.
- The `EXCLUDE` clause for frame
  specification is parsed, but produces an error.
- `IGNORE NULLS` is parsed, but produces an
  error. Only `RESPECT NULLS` is supported.
- `FROM LAST` is parsed, but produces an
  error. Only `FROM FIRST` is supported.

As of MySQL 8.0.28, a maximum of 127 windows is supported for a
given [`SELECT`](select.md "15.2.13 SELECT Statement"). Note that a single
query may use multiple `SELECT` clauses, and
each of these clauses supports up to 127 windows. The number of
distinct windows is defined as the sum of the named windows and
any implicit windows specified as part of any window
function's `OVER` clause. You should also
be aware that queries using very large numbers of windows may
require increasing the default thread stack size
([`thread_stack`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_thread_stack) system variable).
