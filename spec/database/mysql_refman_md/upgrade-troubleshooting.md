## 3.13 Upgrade Troubleshooting

- A schema mismatch in a MySQL 5.7 instance
  between the `.frm` file of a table and the
  `InnoDB` data dictionary can cause an upgrade
  to MySQL 8.0 to fail. Such mismatches may be due
  to `.frm` file corruption. To address this
  issue, dump and restore affected tables before attempting the
  upgrade again.
- If problems occur, such as that the new
  [**mysqld**](mysqld.md "6.3.1 mysqld — The MySQL Server") server does not start, verify that
  you do not have an old `my.cnf` file from
  your previous installation. You can check this with the
  [`--print-defaults`](option-file-options.md#option_general_print-defaults) option (for
  example, [**mysqld --print-defaults**](mysqld.md "6.3.1 mysqld — The MySQL Server")). If this
  command displays anything other than the program name, you
  have an active `my.cnf` file that affects
  server or client operation.
- If, after an upgrade, you experience problems with compiled
  client programs, such as `Commands out of
  sync` or unexpected core dumps, you probably have
  used old header or library files when compiling your programs.
  In this case, check the date for your
  `mysql.h` file and
  `libmysqlclient.a` library to verify that
  they are from the new MySQL distribution. If not, recompile
  your programs with the new headers and libraries.
  Recompilation might also be necessary for programs compiled
  against the shared client library if the library major version
  number has changed (for example, from
  `libmysqlclient.so.20` to
  `libmysqlclient.so.21`).
- If you have created a loadable function with a given name and
  upgrade MySQL to a version that implements a new built-in
  function with the same name, the loadable function becomes
  inaccessible. To correct this, use [`DROP
  FUNCTION`](drop-function.md "15.1.26 DROP FUNCTION Statement") to drop the loadable function, and then use
  [`CREATE FUNCTION`](create-function.md "15.1.14 CREATE FUNCTION Statement") to re-create
  the loadable function with a different nonconflicting name.
  The same is true if the new version of MySQL implements a
  built-in function with the same name as an existing stored
  function. See [Section 11.2.5, “Function Name Parsing and Resolution”](function-resolution.md "11.2.5 Function Name Parsing and Resolution"), for the
  rules describing how the server interprets references to
  different kinds of functions.
- If upgrade to MySQL 8.0 fails due to any of the
  issues outlined in [Section 3.6, “Preparing Your Installation for Upgrade”](upgrade-prerequisites.md "3.6 Preparing Your Installation for Upgrade"),
  the server reverts all changes to the data directory. In this
  case, remove all redo log files and restart the MySQL
  5.7 server on the existing data directory to
  address the errors. The redo log files
  (`ib_logfile*`) reside in the MySQL data
  directory by default. After the errors are fixed, perform a
  slow shutdown (by setting
  [`innodb_fast_shutdown=0`](innodb-parameters.md#sysvar_innodb_fast_shutdown))
  before attempting the upgrade again.
