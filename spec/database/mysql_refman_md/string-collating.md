### 12.13.2 String Collating Support for Complex Character Sets

For a simple character set named
*`MYSET`*, sorting rules are specified in
the `MYSET.xml`
configuration file using `<map>` array
elements within `<collation>` elements.
If the sorting rules for your language are too complex to be
handled with simple arrays, you must define string collating
functions in the
`ctype-MYSET.c`
source file in the `strings` directory.

The existing character sets provide the best documentation and
examples to show how these functions are implemented. Look at
the `ctype-*.c` files in the
`strings` directory, such as the files for
the `big5`, `czech`,
`gbk`, `sjis`, and
`tis160` character sets. Take a look at the
`MY_COLLATION_HANDLER` structures to see how
they are used. See also the
`CHARSET_INFO.txt` file in the
`strings` directory for additional
information.
