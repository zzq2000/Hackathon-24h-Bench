#### 15.6.6.3 Cursor FETCH Statement

```sql
FETCH [[NEXT] FROM] cursor_name INTO var_name [, var_name] ...
```

This statement fetches the next row for the
[`SELECT`](select.md "15.2.13 SELECT Statement") statement associated with
the specified cursor (which must be open), and advances the
cursor pointer. If a row exists, the fetched columns are stored
in the named variables. The number of columns retrieved by the
[`SELECT`](select.md "15.2.13 SELECT Statement") statement must match the
number of output variables specified in the
[`FETCH`](fetch.md "15.6.6.3 Cursor FETCH Statement") statement.

If no more rows are available, a No Data condition occurs with
SQLSTATE value `'02000'`. To detect this
condition, you can set up a handler for it (or for a
`NOT FOUND` condition). For an example, see
[Section 15.6.6, “Cursors”](cursors.md "15.6.6 Cursors").

Be aware that another operation, such as a
`SELECT` or another `FETCH`,
may also cause the handler to execute by raising the same
condition. If it is necessary to distinguish which operation
raised the condition, place the operation within its own
[`BEGIN ...
END`](begin-end.md "15.6.1 BEGIN ... END Compound Statement") block so that it can be associated with its own
handler.
