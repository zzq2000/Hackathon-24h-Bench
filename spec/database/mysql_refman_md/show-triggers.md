#### 15.7.7.40 SHOW TRIGGERS Statement

```sql
SHOW TRIGGERS
    [{FROM | IN} db_name]
    [LIKE 'pattern' | WHERE expr]
```

[`SHOW TRIGGERS`](show-triggers.md "15.7.7.40 SHOW TRIGGERS Statement") lists the triggers
currently defined for tables in a database (the default database
unless a `FROM` clause is given). This
statement returns results only for databases and tables for
which you have the [`TRIGGER`](privileges-provided.md#priv_trigger)
privilege. The [`LIKE`](string-comparison-functions.md#operator_like) clause, if
present, indicates which table names (not trigger names) to
match and causes the statement to display triggers for those
tables. The `WHERE` clause can be given to
select rows using more general conditions, as discussed in
[Section 28.8, “Extensions to SHOW Statements”](extended-show.md "28.8 Extensions to SHOW Statements").

For the `ins_sum` trigger defined in
[Section 27.3, “Using Triggers”](triggers.md "27.3 Using Triggers"), the output of
[`SHOW TRIGGERS`](show-triggers.md "15.7.7.40 SHOW TRIGGERS Statement") is as shown here:

```sql
mysql> SHOW TRIGGERS LIKE 'acc%'\G
*************************** 1. row ***************************
             Trigger: ins_sum
               Event: INSERT
               Table: account
           Statement: SET @sum = @sum + NEW.amount
              Timing: BEFORE

[`SHOW TRIGGERS`](show-triggers.md "15.7.7.40 SHOW TRIGGERS Statement") output has these
columns:

- `Trigger`

  The name of the trigger.
- `Event`

  The trigger event. This is the type of operation on the
  associated table for which the trigger activates. The value
  is `INSERT` (a row was inserted),
  `DELETE` (a row was deleted), or
  `UPDATE` (a row was modified).
- `Table`

  The table for which the trigger is defined.
- `Statement`

  The trigger body; that is, the statement executed when the
  trigger activates.
- `Timing`

  Whether the trigger activates before or after the triggering
  event. The value is `BEFORE` or
  `AFTER`.
- `Created`

  The date and time when the trigger was created. This is a
  `TIMESTAMP(2)` value (with a fractional
  part in hundredths of seconds) for triggers.
- `sql_mode`

  The SQL mode in effect when the trigger was created, and
  under which the trigger executes. For the permitted values,
  see [Section 7.1.11, “Server SQL Modes”](sql-mode.md "7.1.11 Server SQL Modes").
- `Definer`

  The account of the user who created the trigger, in
  `'user_name'@'host_name'`
  format.
- `character_set_client`

  The session value of the
  [`character_set_client`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_character_set_client) system
  variable when the trigger was created.
- `collation_connection`

  The session value of the
  [`collation_connection`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_collation_connection) system
  variable when the trigger was created.
- `Database Collation`

  The collation of the database with which the trigger is
  associated.

Trigger information is also available from the
`INFORMATION_SCHEMA`
[`TRIGGERS`](information-schema-triggers-table.md "28.3.45 The INFORMATION_SCHEMA TRIGGERS Table") table. See
[Section 28.3.45, “The INFORMATION\_SCHEMA TRIGGERS Table”](information-schema-triggers-table.md "28.3.45 The INFORMATION_SCHEMA TRIGGERS Table").
