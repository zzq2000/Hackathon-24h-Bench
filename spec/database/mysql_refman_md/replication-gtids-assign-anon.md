#### 19.1.3.6 Replication From a Source Without GTIDs to a Replica With GTIDs

From MySQL 8.0.23, you can set up replication channels to assign a
GTID to replicated transactions that do not already have one. This
feature enables replication from a source server that does not
have GTIDs enabled and does not use GTID-based replication, to a
replica that has GTIDs enabled. If it is possible to enable GTIDs
on the replication source server, as described in
[Section 19.1.4, “Changing GTID Mode on Online Servers”](replication-mode-change-online.md "19.1.4 Changing GTID Mode on Online Servers"), use that
approach instead. This feature is designed for replication source
servers where you cannot enable GTIDs. Note that as is standard
for MySQL replication, this feature does not support replication
from MySQL source servers earlier than the previous release
series, so MySQL 5.7 is the earliest supported source for a MySQL
8.0 replica.

You can enable GTID assignment on a replication channel using the
`ASSIGN_GTIDS_TO_ANONYMOUS_TRANSACTIONS` option
of the [`CHANGE REPLICATION SOURCE TO`](change-replication-source-to.md "15.4.2.3 CHANGE REPLICATION SOURCE TO Statement")
statement. `LOCAL` assigns a GTID including the
replica's own UUID (the
[`server_uuid`](replication-options.md#sysvar_server_uuid) setting).
`uuid` assigns a GTID
including the specified UUID, such as the
[`server_uuid`](replication-options.md#sysvar_server_uuid) setting for the
replication source server. Using a nonlocal UUID lets you
differentiate between transactions that originated on the replica
and transactions that originated on the source, and for a
multi-source replica, between transactions that originated on
different sources. If any of the transactions sent by the source
do have a GTID already, that GTID is retained.

Important

A replica set up with
`ASSIGN_GTIDS_TO_ANONYMOUS_TRANSACTIONS` on any
channel cannot be promoted to replace the replication source
server in the event that a failover is required, and a backup
taken from the replica cannot be used to restore the replication
source server. The same restriction applies to replacing or
restoring other replicas that use
`ASSIGN_GTIDS_TO_ANONYMOUS_TRANSACTIONS` on any
channel.

The replica must have
[`gtid_mode=ON`](replication-options-gtids.md#sysvar_gtid_mode) set, and this cannot
be changed afterwards, unless you remove the
`ASSIGN_GTIDS_TO_ANONYMOUS_TRANSACTIONS=ON`
setting. If the replica server is started without GTIDs enabled
and with `ASSIGN_GTIDS_TO_ANONYMOUS_TRANSACTIONS`
set for any replication channels, the settings are not changed,
but a warning message is written to the error log explaining how
to change the situation.

For a multi-source replica, you can have a mix of channels that
use `ASSIGN_GTIDS_TO_ANONYMOUS_TRANSACTIONS`, and
channels that do not. Channels specific to Group Replication
cannot use
`ASSIGN_GTIDS_TO_ANONYMOUS_TRANSACTIONS`, but an
asynchronous replication channel for another source on a server
instance that is a Group Replication group member can do so. For a
channel on a Group Replication group member, do not specify the
Group Replication group name as the UUID for creating the GTIDs.

Using `ASSIGN_GTIDS_TO_ANONYMOUS_TRANSACTIONS` on
a replication channel is not the same as introducing GTID-based
replication for the channel. The GTID set
([`gtid_executed`](replication-options-gtids.md#sysvar_gtid_executed)) from a replica
set up with
`ASSIGN_GTIDS_TO_ANONYMOUS_TRANSACTIONS` should
not be transferred to another server or compared with another
server's [`gtid_executed`](replication-options-gtids.md#sysvar_gtid_executed) set. The
GTIDs that are assigned to the anonymous transactions, and the
UUID you choose for them, only have significance for that
replica's own use. The exception to this is any downstream
replicas of the replica where you enabled
`ASSIGN_GTIDS_TO_ANONYMOUS_TRANSACTIONS`, and any
servers that were created from a backup of that replica.

If you set up any downstream replicas, these servers do not have
`ASSIGN_GTIDS_TO_ANONYMOUS_TRANSACTIONS` enabled.
Only the replica that is receiving transactions directly from the
non-GTID source server needs to have
`ASSIGN_GTIDS_TO_ANONYMOUS_TRANSACTIONS` set on
the relevant replication channel. Among that replica and its
downstream replicas, you can compare GTID sets, fail over from one
replica to another, and use backups to create additional replicas,
as you would in any GTID-based replication topology.
`ASSIGN_GTIDS_TO_ANONYMOUS_TRANSACTIONS` is used
where transactions are received from a non-GTID server outside
this group.

A replication channel using
`ASSIGN_GTIDS_TO_ANONYMOUS_TRANSACTIONS` has the
following behavior differences to GTID-based replication:

- GTIDs are assigned to the replicated transactions when they
  are applied (unless they already had a GTID). A GTID would
  normally be assigned on the replication source server when the
  transaction is committed, and sent to the replica along with
  the transaction. On a multi-threaded replica, this means the
  order of the GTIDs does not necessarily match the order of the
  transactions, even if
  [`slave-preserve-commit-order=1`](replication-options-replica.md#sysvar_slave_preserve_commit_order)
  is set.
- The `SOURCE_LOG_FILE` and
  `SOURCE_LOG_POS` options of the
  [`CHANGE REPLICATION SOURCE TO`](change-replication-source-to.md "15.4.2.3 CHANGE REPLICATION SOURCE TO Statement")
  statement are used to position the replication I/O (receiver)
  thread, rather than the
  `SOURCE_AUTO_POSITION` option.
- The `SET GLOBAL sql_replica_skip_counter` or
  `SET GLOBAL sql_slave_skip_counter` statement
  is used to skip transactions on a replication channel set up
  with
  `ASSIGN_GTIDS_TO_ANONYMOUS_TRANSACTIONS`,
  rather than the method of committing empty transactions. For
  instructions, see
  [Section 19.1.7.3, “Skipping Transactions”](replication-administration-skip.md "19.1.7.3 Skipping Transactions").
- The `UNTIL SQL_BEFORE_GTIDS` and
  `UNTIL_SQL_AFTER_GTIDS` options of the
  [`START REPLICA`](start-replica.md "15.4.2.6 START REPLICA Statement") statement cannot
  be used for the channel.
- The function
  `WAIT_UNTIL_SQL_THREAD_AFTER_GTIDS()`, which
  is deprecated from MySQL 8.0.18, cannot be used with the
  channel. Its replacement
  `WAIT_FOR_EXECUTED_GTID_SET()`, which works
  across the server, can be used to wait for any downstream
  replicas of the server that has
  `ASSIGN_GTIDS_TO_ANONYMOUS_TRANSACTIONS`
  enabled. To wait for the channel with
  `ASSIGN_GTIDS_TO_ANONYMOUS_TRANSACTIONS`
  enabled to catch up with the source, which does not use GTIDs,
  use the `SOURCE_POS_WAIT()` function (from
  MySQL 8.0.26) or the `MASTER_POS_WAIT()`
  function.

The Performance Schema
[`replication_applier_configuration`](performance-schema-replication-applier-configuration-table.md "29.12.11.2 The replication_applier_configuration Table")
table shows whether GTIDs are assigned to anonymous transactions
on a replication channel, what the UUID is, and whether it is the
UUID of the replica server (`LOCAL`) or a
user-specified UUID (`UUID`). The information is
also recorded in the applier metadata repository. A
[`RESET REPLICA
ALL`](reset-replica.md "15.4.2.4 RESET REPLICA Statement") statement resets the
`ASSIGN_GTIDS_TO_ANONYMOUS_TRANSACTIONS` setting,
but a [`RESET REPLICA`](reset-replica.md "15.4.2.4 RESET REPLICA Statement") statement does
not.
