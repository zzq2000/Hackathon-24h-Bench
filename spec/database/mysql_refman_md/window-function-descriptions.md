### 14.20.1 Window Function Descriptions

This section describes nonaggregate window functions that, for
each row from a query, perform a calculation using rows related
to that row. Most aggregate functions also can be used as window
functions; see [Section 14.19.1, “Aggregate Function Descriptions”](aggregate-functions.md "14.19.1 Aggregate Function Descriptions").

For window function usage information and examples, and
definitions of terms such as the `OVER` clause,
window, partition, frame, and peer, see
[Section 14.20.2, “Window Function Concepts and Syntax”](window-functions-usage.md "14.20.2 Window Function Concepts and Syntax").

**Table 14.30 Window Functions**

| Name | Description |
| --- | --- |
| [`CUME_DIST()`](window-function-descriptions.md#function_cume-dist) | Cumulative distribution value |
| [`DENSE_RANK()`](window-function-descriptions.md#function_dense-rank) | Rank of current row within its partition, without gaps |
| [`FIRST_VALUE()`](window-function-descriptions.md#function_first-value) | Value of argument from first row of window frame |
| [`LAG()`](window-function-descriptions.md#function_lag) | Value of argument from row lagging current row within partition |
| [`LAST_VALUE()`](window-function-descriptions.md#function_last-value) | Value of argument from last row of window frame |
| [`LEAD()`](window-function-descriptions.md#function_lead) | Value of argument from row leading current row within partition |
| [`NTH_VALUE()`](window-function-descriptions.md#function_nth-value) | Value of argument from N-th row of window frame |
| [`NTILE()`](window-function-descriptions.md#function_ntile) | Bucket number of current row within its partition. |
| [`PERCENT_RANK()`](window-function-descriptions.md#function_percent-rank) | Percentage rank value |
| [`RANK()`](window-function-descriptions.md#function_rank) | Rank of current row within its partition, with gaps |
| [`ROW_NUMBER()`](window-function-descriptions.md#function_row-number) | Number of current row within its partition |

In the following function descriptions,
*`over_clause`* represents the
`OVER` clause, described in
[Section 14.20.2, “Window Function Concepts and Syntax”](window-functions-usage.md "14.20.2 Window Function Concepts and Syntax"). Some window functions
permit a *`null_treatment`* clause that
specifies how to handle `NULL` values when
calculating results. This clause is optional. It is part of the
SQL standard, but the MySQL implementation permits only
`RESPECT NULLS` (which is also the default).
This means that `NULL` values are considered
when calculating results. `IGNORE NULLS` is
parsed, but produces an error.

- [`CUME_DIST()`](window-function-descriptions.md#function_cume-dist)
  *`over_clause`*

  Returns the cumulative distribution of a value within a
  group of values; that is, the percentage of partition values
  less than or equal to the value in the current row. This
  represents the number of rows preceding or peer with the
  current row in the window ordering of the window partition
  divided by the total number of rows in the window partition.
  Return values range from 0 to 1.

  This function should be used with `ORDER
  BY` to sort partition rows into the desired order.
  Without `ORDER BY`, all rows are peers and
  have value
  *`N`*/*`N`* =
  1, where *`N`* is the partition size.

  *`over_clause`* is as described in
  [Section 14.20.2, “Window Function Concepts and Syntax”](window-functions-usage.md "14.20.2 Window Function Concepts and Syntax").

  The following query shows, for the set of values in the
  `val` column, the
  `CUME_DIST()` value for each row, as well
  as the percentage rank value returned by the similar
  `PERCENT_RANK()` function. For reference,
  the query also displays row numbers using
  [`ROW_NUMBER()`](window-function-descriptions.md#function_row-number):

  ```sql
  mysql> SELECT
           val,
           ROW_NUMBER()   OVER w AS 'row_number',
           CUME_DIST()    OVER w AS 'cume_dist',
           PERCENT_RANK() OVER w AS 'percent_rank'
         FROM numbers
         WINDOW w AS (ORDER BY val);
  +------+------------+--------------------+--------------+
  | val  | row_number | cume_dist          | percent_rank |
  +------+------------+--------------------+--------------+
  |    1 |          1 | 0.2222222222222222 |            0 |
  |    1 |          2 | 0.2222222222222222 |            0 |
  |    2 |          3 | 0.3333333333333333 |         0.25 |
  |    3 |          4 | 0.6666666666666666 |        0.375 |
  |    3 |          5 | 0.6666666666666666 |        0.375 |
  |    3 |          6 | 0.6666666666666666 |        0.375 |
  |    4 |          7 | 0.8888888888888888 |         0.75 |
  |    4 |          8 | 0.8888888888888888 |         0.75 |
  |    5 |          9 |                  1 |            1 |
  +------+------------+--------------------+--------------+
  ```
- [`DENSE_RANK()`](window-function-descriptions.md#function_dense-rank)
  *`over_clause`*

  Returns the rank of the current row within its partition,
  without gaps. Peers are considered ties and receive the same
  rank. This function assigns consecutive ranks to peer
  groups; the result is that groups of size greater than one
  do not produce noncontiguous rank numbers. For an example,
  see the [`RANK()`](window-function-descriptions.md#function_rank) function
  description.

  This function should be used with `ORDER
  BY` to sort partition rows into the desired order.
  Without `ORDER BY`, all rows are peers.

  *`over_clause`* is as described in
  [Section 14.20.2, “Window Function Concepts and Syntax”](window-functions-usage.md "14.20.2 Window Function Concepts and Syntax").
- [`FIRST_VALUE(expr)`](window-function-descriptions.md#function_first-value)
  [*`null_treatment`*]
  *`over_clause`*

  Returns the value of *`expr`* from
  the first row of the window frame.

  *`over_clause`* is as described in
  [Section 14.20.2, “Window Function Concepts and Syntax”](window-functions-usage.md "14.20.2 Window Function Concepts and Syntax").
  *`null_treatment`* is as described in
  the section introduction.

  The following query demonstrates
  [`FIRST_VALUE()`](window-function-descriptions.md#function_first-value),
  [`LAST_VALUE()`](window-function-descriptions.md#function_last-value), and two
  instances of [`NTH_VALUE()`](window-function-descriptions.md#function_nth-value):

  ```sql
  mysql> SELECT
           time, subject, val,
           FIRST_VALUE(val)  OVER w AS 'first',
           LAST_VALUE(val)   OVER w AS 'last',
           NTH_VALUE(val, 2) OVER w AS 'second',
           NTH_VALUE(val, 4) OVER w AS 'fourth'
         FROM observations
         WINDOW w AS (PARTITION BY subject ORDER BY time
                      ROWS UNBOUNDED PRECEDING);
  +----------+---------+------+-------+------+--------+--------+
  | time     | subject | val  | first | last | second | fourth |
  +----------+---------+------+-------+------+--------+--------+
  | 07:00:00 | st113   |   10 |    10 |   10 |   NULL |   NULL |
  | 07:15:00 | st113   |    9 |    10 |    9 |      9 |   NULL |
  | 07:30:00 | st113   |   25 |    10 |   25 |      9 |   NULL |
  | 07:45:00 | st113   |   20 |    10 |   20 |      9 |     20 |
  | 07:00:00 | xh458   |    0 |     0 |    0 |   NULL |   NULL |
  | 07:15:00 | xh458   |   10 |     0 |   10 |     10 |   NULL |
  | 07:30:00 | xh458   |    5 |     0 |    5 |     10 |   NULL |
  | 07:45:00 | xh458   |   30 |     0 |   30 |     10 |     30 |
  | 08:00:00 | xh458   |   25 |     0 |   25 |     10 |     30 |
  +----------+---------+------+-------+------+--------+--------+
  ```

  Each function uses the rows in the current frame, which, per
  the window definition shown, extends from the first
  partition row to the current row. For the
  [`NTH_VALUE()`](window-function-descriptions.md#function_nth-value) calls, the
  current frame does not always include the requested row; in
  such cases, the return value is `NULL`.
- [`LAG(expr [,
  N[,
  default]])`](window-function-descriptions.md#function_lag)
  [*`null_treatment`*]
  *`over_clause`*

  Returns the value of *`expr`* from
  the row that lags (precedes) the current row by
  *`N`* rows within its partition. If
  there is no such row, the return value is
  *`default`*. For example, if
  *`N`* is 3, the return value is
  *`default`* for the first three rows.
  If *`N`* or
  *`default`* are missing, the defaults
  are 1 and `NULL`, respectively.

  *`N`* must be a literal nonnegative
  integer. If *`N`* is 0,
  *`expr`* is evaluated for the current
  row.

  Beginning with MySQL 8.0.22, *`N`*
  cannot be `NULL`. In addition, it must now
  be an integer in the range `0` to
  `263`,
  inclusive, in any of the following forms:

  - an unsigned integer constant literal
  - a positional parameter marker (`?`)
  - a user-defined variable
  - a local variable in a stored routine

  *`over_clause`* is as described in
  [Section 14.20.2, “Window Function Concepts and Syntax”](window-functions-usage.md "14.20.2 Window Function Concepts and Syntax").
  *`null_treatment`* is as described in
  the section introduction.

  [`LAG()`](window-function-descriptions.md#function_lag) (and the similar
  [`LEAD()`](window-function-descriptions.md#function_lead) function) are often
  used to compute differences between rows. The following
  query shows a set of time-ordered observations and, for each
  one, the [`LAG()`](window-function-descriptions.md#function_lag) and
  [`LEAD()`](window-function-descriptions.md#function_lead) values from the
  adjoining rows, as well as the differences between the
  current and adjoining rows:

  ```sql
  mysql> SELECT
           t, val,
           LAG(val)        OVER w AS 'lag',
           LEAD(val)       OVER w AS 'lead',
           val - LAG(val)  OVER w AS 'lag diff',
           val - LEAD(val) OVER w AS 'lead diff'
         FROM series
         WINDOW w AS (ORDER BY t);
  +----------+------+------+------+----------+-----------+
  | t        | val  | lag  | lead | lag diff | lead diff |
  +----------+------+------+------+----------+-----------+
  | 12:00:00 |  100 | NULL |  125 |     NULL |       -25 |
  | 13:00:00 |  125 |  100 |  132 |       25 |        -7 |
  | 14:00:00 |  132 |  125 |  145 |        7 |       -13 |
  | 15:00:00 |  145 |  132 |  140 |       13 |         5 |
  | 16:00:00 |  140 |  145 |  150 |       -5 |       -10 |
  | 17:00:00 |  150 |  140 |  200 |       10 |       -50 |
  | 18:00:00 |  200 |  150 | NULL |       50 |      NULL |
  +----------+------+------+------+----------+-----------+
  ```

  In the example, the [`LAG()`](window-function-descriptions.md#function_lag) and
  [`LEAD()`](window-function-descriptions.md#function_lead) calls use the default
  *`N`* and
  *`default`* values of 1 and
  `NULL`, respectively.

  The first row shows what happens when there is no previous
  row for [`LAG()`](window-function-descriptions.md#function_lag): The function
  returns the *`default`* value (in
  this case, `NULL`). The last row shows the
  same thing when there is no next row for
  [`LEAD()`](window-function-descriptions.md#function_lead).

  [`LAG()`](window-function-descriptions.md#function_lag) and
  [`LEAD()`](window-function-descriptions.md#function_lead) also serve to compute
  sums rather than differences. Consider this data set, which
  contains the first few numbers of the Fibonacci series:

  ```sql
  mysql> SELECT n FROM fib ORDER BY n;
  +------+
  | n    |
  +------+
  |    1 |
  |    1 |
  |    2 |
  |    3 |
  |    5 |
  |    8 |
  +------+
  ```

  The following query shows the
  [`LAG()`](window-function-descriptions.md#function_lag) and
  [`LEAD()`](window-function-descriptions.md#function_lead) values for the rows
  adjacent to the current row. It also uses those functions to
  add to the current row value the values from the preceding
  and following rows. The effect is to generate the next
  number in the Fibonacci series, and the next number after
  that:

  ```sql
  mysql> SELECT
           n,
           LAG(n, 1, 0)      OVER w AS 'lag',
           LEAD(n, 1, 0)     OVER w AS 'lead',
           n + LAG(n, 1, 0)  OVER w AS 'next_n',
           n + LEAD(n, 1, 0) OVER w AS 'next_next_n'
         FROM fib
         WINDOW w AS (ORDER BY n);
  +------+------+------+--------+-------------+
  | n    | lag  | lead | next_n | next_next_n |
  +------+------+------+--------+-------------+
  |    1 |    0 |    1 |      1 |           2 |
  |    1 |    1 |    2 |      2 |           3 |
  |    2 |    1 |    3 |      3 |           5 |
  |    3 |    2 |    5 |      5 |           8 |
  |    5 |    3 |    8 |      8 |          13 |
  |    8 |    5 |    0 |     13 |           8 |
  +------+------+------+--------+-------------+
  ```

  One way to generate the initial set of Fibonacci numbers is
  to use a recursive common table expression. For an example,
  see
  [Fibonacci Series Generation](with.md#common-table-expressions-recursive-fibonacci-series "Fibonacci Series Generation").

  Beginning with MySQL 8.0.22, you cannot use a negative value
  for the rows argument of this function.
- [`LAST_VALUE(expr)`](window-function-descriptions.md#function_last-value)
  [*`null_treatment`*]
  *`over_clause`*

  Returns the value of *`expr`* from
  the last row of the window frame.

  *`over_clause`* is as described in
  [Section 14.20.2, “Window Function Concepts and Syntax”](window-functions-usage.md "14.20.2 Window Function Concepts and Syntax").
  *`null_treatment`* is as described in
  the section introduction.

  For an example, see the
  [`FIRST_VALUE()`](window-function-descriptions.md#function_first-value) function
  description.
- [`LEAD(expr [,
  N[,
  default]])`](window-function-descriptions.md#function_lead)
  [*`null_treatment`*]
  *`over_clause`*

  Returns the value of *`expr`* from
  the row that leads (follows) the current row by
  *`N`* rows within its partition. If
  there is no such row, the return value is
  *`default`*. For example, if
  *`N`* is 3, the return value is
  *`default`* for the last three rows.
  If *`N`* or
  *`default`* are missing, the defaults
  are 1 and `NULL`, respectively.

  *`N`* must be a literal nonnegative
  integer. If *`N`* is 0,
  *`expr`* is evaluated for the current
  row.

  Beginning with MySQL 8.0.22, *`N`*
  cannot be `NULL`. In addition, it must now
  be an integer in the range `0` to
  `263`,
  inclusive, in any of the following forms:

  - an unsigned integer constant literal
  - a positional parameter marker (`?`)
  - a user-defined variable
  - a local variable in a stored routine

  *`over_clause`* is as described in
  [Section 14.20.2, “Window Function Concepts and Syntax”](window-functions-usage.md "14.20.2 Window Function Concepts and Syntax").
  *`null_treatment`* is as described in
  the section introduction.

  For an example, see the [`LAG()`](window-function-descriptions.md#function_lag)
  function description.

  In MySQL 8.0.22 and later, use of a negative value for the
  rows argument of this function is not permitted.
- [`NTH_VALUE(expr,
  N)`](window-function-descriptions.md#function_nth-value)
  [*`from_first_last`*]
  [*`null_treatment`*]
  *`over_clause`*

  Returns the value of *`expr`* from
  the *`N`*-th row of the window frame.
  If there is no such row, the return value is
  `NULL`.

  *`N`* must be a literal positive
  integer.

  *`from_first_last`* is part of the
  SQL standard, but the MySQL implementation permits only
  `FROM FIRST` (which is also the default).
  This means that calculations begin at the first row of the
  window. `FROM LAST` is parsed, but produces
  an error. To obtain the same effect as `FROM
  LAST` (begin calculations at the last row of the
  window), use `ORDER BY` to sort in reverse
  order.

  *`over_clause`* is as described in
  [Section 14.20.2, “Window Function Concepts and Syntax”](window-functions-usage.md "14.20.2 Window Function Concepts and Syntax").
  *`null_treatment`* is as described in
  the section introduction.

  For an example, see the
  [`FIRST_VALUE()`](window-function-descriptions.md#function_first-value) function
  description.

  In MySQL 8.0.22 and later, you cannot use
  `NULL` for the row argument of this
  function.
- [`NTILE(N)`](window-function-descriptions.md#function_ntile)
  *`over_clause`*

  Divides a partition into *`N`* groups
  (buckets), assigns each row in the partition its bucket
  number, and returns the bucket number of the current row
  within its partition. For example, if
  *`N`* is 4,
  `NTILE()` divides rows into four buckets.
  If *`N`* is 100,
  `NTILE()` divides rows into 100 buckets.

  *`N`* must be a literal positive
  integer. Bucket number return values range from 1 to
  *`N`*.

  Beginning with MySQL 8.0.22, *`N`*
  cannot be `NULL`, and must be an integer in
  the range `0` to
  `263`,
  inclusive, in any of the following forms:

  - an unsigned integer constant literal
  - a positional parameter marker (`?`)
  - a user-defined variable
  - a local variable in a stored routine

  This function should be used with `ORDER
  BY` to sort partition rows into the desired order.

  *`over_clause`* is as described in
  [Section 14.20.2, “Window Function Concepts and Syntax”](window-functions-usage.md "14.20.2 Window Function Concepts and Syntax").

  The following query shows, for the set of values in the
  `val` column, the percentile values
  resulting from dividing the rows into two or four groups.
  For reference, the query also displays row numbers using
  [`ROW_NUMBER()`](window-function-descriptions.md#function_row-number):

  ```sql
  mysql> SELECT
           val,
           ROW_NUMBER() OVER w AS 'row_number',
           NTILE(2)     OVER w AS 'ntile2',
           NTILE(4)     OVER w AS 'ntile4'
         FROM numbers
         WINDOW w AS (ORDER BY val);
  +------+------------+--------+--------+
  | val  | row_number | ntile2 | ntile4 |
  +------+------------+--------+--------+
  |    1 |          1 |      1 |      1 |
  |    1 |          2 |      1 |      1 |
  |    2 |          3 |      1 |      1 |
  |    3 |          4 |      1 |      2 |
  |    3 |          5 |      1 |      2 |
  |    3 |          6 |      2 |      3 |
  |    4 |          7 |      2 |      3 |
  |    4 |          8 |      2 |      4 |
  |    5 |          9 |      2 |      4 |
  +------+------------+--------+--------+
  ```

  Beginning with MySQL 8.0.22, the construct
  `NTILE(NULL)` is no longer permitted.
- [`PERCENT_RANK()`](window-function-descriptions.md#function_percent-rank)
  *`over_clause`*

  Returns the percentage of partition values less than the
  value in the current row, excluding the highest value.
  Return values range from 0 to 1 and represent the row
  relative rank, calculated as the result of this formula,
  where *`rank`* is the row rank and
  *`rows`* is the number of partition
  rows:

  ```clike
  (rank - 1) / (rows - 1)
  ```

  This function should be used with `ORDER
  BY` to sort partition rows into the desired order.
  Without `ORDER BY`, all rows are peers.

  *`over_clause`* is as described in
  [Section 14.20.2, “Window Function Concepts and Syntax”](window-functions-usage.md "14.20.2 Window Function Concepts and Syntax").

  For an example, see the
  [`CUME_DIST()`](window-function-descriptions.md#function_cume-dist) function
  description.
- [`RANK()`](window-function-descriptions.md#function_rank)
  *`over_clause`*

  Returns the rank of the current row within its partition,
  with gaps. Peers are considered ties and receive the same
  rank. This function does not assign consecutive ranks to
  peer groups if groups of size greater than one exist; the
  result is noncontiguous rank numbers.

  This function should be used with `ORDER
  BY` to sort partition rows into the desired order.
  Without `ORDER BY`, all rows are peers.

  *`over_clause`* is as described in
  [Section 14.20.2, “Window Function Concepts and Syntax”](window-functions-usage.md "14.20.2 Window Function Concepts and Syntax").

  The following query shows the difference between
  [`RANK()`](window-function-descriptions.md#function_rank), which produces ranks
  with gaps, and [`DENSE_RANK()`](window-function-descriptions.md#function_dense-rank),
  which produces ranks without gaps. The query shows rank
  values for each member of a set of values in the
  `val` column, which contains some
  duplicates. [`RANK()`](window-function-descriptions.md#function_rank) assigns
  peers (the duplicates) the same rank value, and the next
  greater value has a rank higher by the number of peers minus
  one. [`DENSE_RANK()`](window-function-descriptions.md#function_dense-rank) also
  assigns peers the same rank value, but the next higher value
  has a rank one greater. For reference, the query also
  displays row numbers using
  [`ROW_NUMBER()`](window-function-descriptions.md#function_row-number):

  ```sql
  mysql> SELECT
           val,

- [`ROW_NUMBER()`](window-function-descriptions.md#function_row-number)
  *`over_clause`*

  Returns the number of the current row within its partition.
  Rows numbers range from 1 to the number of partition rows.

  `ORDER BY` affects the order in which rows
  are numbered. Without `ORDER BY`, row
  numbering is nondeterministic.

  [`ROW_NUMBER()`](window-function-descriptions.md#function_row-number) assigns peers
  different row numbers. To assign peers the same value, use
  [`RANK()`](window-function-descriptions.md#function_rank) or
  [`DENSE_RANK()`](window-function-descriptions.md#function_dense-rank). For an example,
  see the [`RANK()`](window-function-descriptions.md#function_rank) function
  description.

  *`over_clause`* is as described in
  [Section 14.20.2, “Window Function Concepts and Syntax”](window-functions-usage.md "14.20.2 Window Function Concepts and Syntax").
