### 19.2.4 Relay Log and Replication Metadata Repositories

[19.2.4.1 The Relay Log](replica-logs-relaylog.md)

[19.2.4.2 Replication Metadata Repositories](replica-logs-status.md)

A replica server creates several repositories of information to
use for the replication process:

- The replica's *relay log*, which is written
  by the replication I/O (receiver) thread, contains the
  transactions read from the replication source server's binary
  log. The transactions in the relay log are applied on the
  replica by the replication SQL (applier) thread. For
  information about the relay log, see
  [Section 19.2.4.1, “The Relay Log”](replica-logs-relaylog.md "19.2.4.1 The Relay Log").
- The replica's *connection metadata
  repository* contains information that the
  replication receiver thread needs to connect to the
  replication source server and retrieve transactions from the
  source's binary log. The connection metadata repository is
  written to the `mysql.slave_master_info`
  table.
- The replica's *applier metadata repository*
  contains information that the replication applier thread needs
  to read and apply transactions from the replica's relay log.
  The applier metadata repository is written to the
  `mysql.slave_relay_log_info` table.

The replica's connection metadata repository and applier metadata
repository are collectively known as the replication metadata
repositories. For information about these, see
[Section 19.2.4.2, “Replication Metadata Repositories”](replica-logs-status.md "19.2.4.2 Replication Metadata Repositories").

**Making replication resilient to unexpected halts.**
The `mysql.slave_master_info` and
`mysql.slave_relay_log_info` tables are created
using the transactional storage engine
[`InnoDB`](innodb-storage-engine.md "Chapter 17 The InnoDB Storage Engine"). Updates to the replica's
applier metadata repository table are committed together with
the transactions, meaning that the replica's progress
information recorded in that repository is always consistent
with what has been applied to the database, even in the event of
an unexpected server halt. For information on the combination of
settings on the replica that is most resilient to unexpected
halts, see
[Section 19.4.2, “Handling an Unexpected Halt of a Replica”](replication-solutions-unexpected-replica-halt.md "19.4.2 Handling an Unexpected Halt of a Replica").
