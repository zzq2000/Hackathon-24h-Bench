### 29.19.1 Query Profiling Using Performance Schema

The following example demonstrates how to use Performance Schema
statement events and stage events to retrieve data comparable to
profiling information provided by [`SHOW
PROFILES`](show-profiles.md "15.7.7.31 SHOW PROFILES Statement") and [`SHOW
PROFILE`](show-profile.md "15.7.7.30 SHOW PROFILE Statement") statements.

The [`setup_actors`](performance-schema-setup-actors-table.md "29.12.2.1 The setup_actors Table") table can be used
to limit the collection of historical events by host, user, or
account to reduce runtime overhead and the amount of data
collected in history tables. The first step of the example shows
how to limit collection of historical events to a specific user.

Performance Schema displays event timer information in
picoseconds (trillionths of a second) to normalize timing data
to a standard unit. In the following example,
`TIMER_WAIT` values are divided by
1000000000000 to show data in units of seconds. Values are also
truncated to 6 decimal places to display data in the same format
as [`SHOW PROFILES`](show-profiles.md "15.7.7.31 SHOW PROFILES Statement") and
[`SHOW PROFILE`](show-profile.md "15.7.7.30 SHOW PROFILE Statement") statements.

1. Limit the collection of historical events to the user that
   runs the query. By default,
   [`setup_actors`](performance-schema-setup-actors-table.md "29.12.2.1 The setup_actors Table") is configured to
   allow monitoring and historical event collection for all
   foreground threads:

   ```sql
   mysql> SELECT * FROM performance_schema.setup_actors;
   +------+------+------+---------+---------+
   | HOST | USER | ROLE | ENABLED | HISTORY |
   +------+------+------+---------+---------+
   | %    | %    | %    | YES     | YES     |
   +------+------+------+---------+---------+
   ```

   Update the default row in the
   [`setup_actors`](performance-schema-setup-actors-table.md "29.12.2.1 The setup_actors Table") table to disable
   historical event collection and monitoring for all
   foreground threads, and insert a new row that enables
   monitoring and historical event collection for the user that
   runs the query:

   ```sql
   mysql> UPDATE performance_schema.setup_actors
          SET ENABLED = 'NO', HISTORY = 'NO'
          WHERE HOST = '%' AND USER = '%';

   mysql> INSERT INTO performance_schema.setup_actors
          (HOST,USER,ROLE,ENABLED,HISTORY)
          VALUES('localhost','test_user','%','YES','YES');
   ```

   Data in the [`setup_actors`](performance-schema-setup-actors-table.md "29.12.2.1 The setup_actors Table") table
   should now appear similar to the following:

   ```sql
   mysql> SELECT * FROM performance_schema.setup_actors;
   +-----------+-----------+------+---------+---------+
   | HOST      | USER      | ROLE | ENABLED | HISTORY |
   +-----------+-----------+------+---------+---------+
   | %         | %         | %    | NO      | NO      |
   | localhost | test_user | %    | YES     | YES     |
   +-----------+-----------+------+---------+---------+
   ```
2. Ensure that statement and stage instrumentation is enabled
   by updating the
   [`setup_instruments`](performance-schema-setup-instruments-table.md "29.12.2.3 The setup_instruments Table") table. Some
   instruments may already be enabled by default.

   ```sql
   mysql> UPDATE performance_schema.setup_instruments
          SET ENABLED = 'YES', TIMED = 'YES'
          WHERE NAME LIKE '%statement/%';

   mysql> UPDATE performance_schema.setup_instruments
          SET ENABLED = 'YES', TIMED = 'YES'
          WHERE NAME LIKE '%stage/%';
   ```
3. Ensure that `events_statements_*` and
   `events_stages_*` consumers are enabled.
   Some consumers may already be enabled by default.

   ```sql
   mysql> UPDATE performance_schema.setup_consumers
          SET ENABLED = 'YES'
          WHERE NAME LIKE '%events_statements_%';

   mysql> UPDATE performance_schema.setup_consumers
          SET ENABLED = 'YES'
          WHERE NAME LIKE '%events_stages_%';
   ```
4. Under the user account you are monitoring, run the statement
   that you want to profile. For example:

   ```sql
   mysql> SELECT * FROM employees.employees WHERE emp_no = 10001;
   +--------+------------+------------+-----------+--------+------------+
   | emp_no | birth_date | first_name | last_name | gender | hire_date |
   +--------+------------+------------+-----------+--------+------------+
   |  10001 | 1953-09-02 | Georgi     | Facello   | M      | 1986-06-26 |
   +--------+------------+------------+-----------+--------+------------+
   ```
5. Identify the `EVENT_ID` of the statement by
   querying the
   [`events_statements_history_long`](performance-schema-events-statements-history-long-table.md "29.12.6.3 The events_statements_history_long Table")
   table. This step is similar to running
   [`SHOW PROFILES`](show-profiles.md "15.7.7.31 SHOW PROFILES Statement") to identify the
   `Query_ID`. The following query produces
   output similar to [`SHOW
   PROFILES`](show-profiles.md "15.7.7.31 SHOW PROFILES Statement"):

   ```sql
   mysql> SELECT EVENT_ID, TRUNCATE(TIMER_WAIT/1000000000000,6) as Duration, SQL_TEXT
          FROM performance_schema.events_statements_history_long WHERE SQL_TEXT like '%10001%';
   +----------+----------+--------------------------------------------------------+
   | event_id | duration | sql_text                                               |
   +----------+----------+--------------------------------------------------------+
   |       31 | 0.028310 | SELECT * FROM employees.employees WHERE emp_no = 10001 |
   +----------+----------+--------------------------------------------------------+
   ```
6. Query the
   [`events_stages_history_long`](performance-schema-events-stages-history-long-table.md "29.12.5.3 The events_stages_history_long Table")
   table to retrieve the statement's stage events. Stages are
   linked to statements using event nesting. Each stage event
   record has a `NESTING_EVENT_ID` column that
   contains the `EVENT_ID` of the parent
   statement.

   ```sql
   mysql> SELECT event_name AS Stage, TRUNCATE(TIMER_WAIT/1000000000000,6) AS Duration
          FROM performance_schema.events_stages_history_long WHERE NESTING_EVENT_ID=31;
   +--------------------------------+----------+
   | Stage                          | Duration |
   +--------------------------------+----------+
   | stage/sql/starting             | 0.000080 |
   | stage/sql/checking permissions | 0.000005 |
   | stage/sql/Opening tables       | 0.027759 |
   | stage/sql/init                 | 0.000052 |
   | stage/sql/System lock          | 0.000009 |
   | stage/sql/optimizing           | 0.000006 |
   | stage/sql/statistics           | 0.000082 |

   | stage/sql/executing            | 0.000000 |
   | stage/sql/Sending data         | 0.000017 |
   | stage/sql/end                  | 0.000001 |
   | stage/sql/query end            | 0.000004 |
   | stage/sql/closing tables       | 0.000006 |
   | stage/sql/freeing items        | 0.000272 |
   | stage/sql/cleaning up          | 0.000001 |
   +--------------------------------+----------+
   ```
