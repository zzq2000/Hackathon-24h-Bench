#### 15.7.7.38 SHOW TABLE STATUS Statement

```sql
SHOW TABLE STATUS
    [{FROM | IN} db_name]
    [LIKE 'pattern' | WHERE expr]
```

[`SHOW TABLE STATUS`](show-table-status.md "15.7.7.38 SHOW TABLE STATUS Statement") works likes
[`SHOW TABLES`](show-tables.md "15.7.7.39 SHOW TABLES Statement"), but provides a lot
of information about each non-`TEMPORARY`
table. You can also get this list using the [**mysqlshow
--status *`db_name`***](mysqlshow.md "6.5.7 mysqlshow — Display Database, Table, and Column Information") command.
The [`LIKE`](string-comparison-functions.md#operator_like) clause, if present,
indicates which table names to match. The
`WHERE` clause can be given to select rows
using more general conditions, as discussed in
[Section 28.8, “Extensions to SHOW Statements”](extended-show.md "28.8 Extensions to SHOW Statements").

This statement also displays information about views.

[`SHOW TABLE STATUS`](show-table-status.md "15.7.7.38 SHOW TABLE STATUS Statement") output has
these columns:

- `Name`

  The name of the table.
- `Engine`

  The storage engine for the table. See
  [Chapter 17, *The InnoDB Storage Engine*](innodb-storage-engine.md "Chapter 17 The InnoDB Storage Engine"), and
  [Chapter 18, *Alternative Storage Engines*](storage-engines.md "Chapter 18 Alternative Storage Engines").

  For partitioned tables, `Engine` shows the
  name of the storage engine used by all partitions.
- `Version`

  This column is unused. With the removal of
  `.frm` files in MySQL 8.0, this column
  now reports a hardcoded value of `10`,
  which is the last `.frm` file version
  used in MySQL 5.7.
- `Row_format`

  The row-storage format (`Fixed`,
  `Dynamic`, `Compressed`,
  `Redundant`, `Compact`).
  For `MyISAM` tables,
  `Dynamic` corresponds to what
  [**myisamchk -dvv**](myisamchk.md "6.6.4 myisamchk — MyISAM Table-Maintenance Utility") reports as
  `Packed`.
- `Rows`

  The number of rows. Some storage engines, such as
  `MyISAM`, store the exact count. For other
  storage engines, such as `InnoDB`, this
  value is an approximation, and may vary from the actual
  value by as much as 40% to 50%. In such cases, use
  `SELECT COUNT(*)` to obtain an accurate
  count.

  The `Rows` value is `NULL`
  for `INFORMATION_SCHEMA` tables.

  For [`InnoDB`](innodb-storage-engine.md "Chapter 17 The InnoDB Storage Engine") tables, the row
  count is only a rough estimate used in SQL optimization.
  (This is also true if the
  [`InnoDB`](innodb-storage-engine.md "Chapter 17 The InnoDB Storage Engine") table is partitioned.)
- `Avg_row_length`

  The average row length.
- `Data_length`

  For `MyISAM`,
  `Data_length` is the length of the data
  file, in bytes.

  For `InnoDB`,
  `Data_length` is the approximate amount of
  space allocated for the clustered index, in bytes.
  Specifically, it is the clustered index size, in pages,
  multiplied by the `InnoDB` page size.

  Refer to the notes at the end of this section for
  information regarding other storage engines.
- `Max_data_length`

  For `MyISAM`,
  `Max_data_length` is maximum length of the
  data file. This is the total number of bytes of data that
  can be stored in the table, given the data pointer size
  used.

  Unused for `InnoDB`.

  Refer to the notes at the end of this section for
  information regarding other storage engines.
- `Index_length`

  For `MyISAM`,
  `Index_length` is the length of the index
  file, in bytes.

  For `InnoDB`,
  `Index_length` is the approximate amount of
  space allocated for non-clustered indexes, in bytes.
  Specifically, it is the sum of non-clustered index sizes, in
  pages, multiplied by the `InnoDB` page
  size.

  Refer to the notes at the end of this section for
  information regarding other storage engines.
- `Data_free`

  The number of allocated but unused bytes.

  `InnoDB` tables report the free space of
  the tablespace to which the table belongs. For a table
  located in the shared tablespace, this is the free space of
  the shared tablespace. If you are using multiple tablespaces
  and the table has its own tablespace, the free space is for
  only that table. Free space means the number of bytes in
  completely free extents minus a safety margin. Even if free
  space displays as 0, it may be possible to insert rows as
  long as new extents need not be allocated.

  For NDB Cluster, `Data_free` shows the
  space allocated on disk for, but not used by, a Disk Data
  table or fragment on disk. (In-memory data resource usage is
  reported by the `Data_length` column.)

  For partitioned tables, this value is only an estimate and
  may not be absolutely correct. A more accurate method of
  obtaining this information in such cases is to query the
  `INFORMATION_SCHEMA`
  [`PARTITIONS`](information-schema-partitions-table.md "28.3.21 The INFORMATION_SCHEMA PARTITIONS Table") table, as shown in
  this example:

  ```sql
  SELECT SUM(DATA_FREE)
      FROM  INFORMATION_SCHEMA.PARTITIONS
      WHERE TABLE_SCHEMA = 'mydb'
      AND   TABLE_NAME   = 'mytable';
  ```

  For more information, see
  [Section 28.3.21, “The INFORMATION\_SCHEMA PARTITIONS Table”](information-schema-partitions-table.md "28.3.21 The INFORMATION_SCHEMA PARTITIONS Table").
- `Auto_increment`

  The next `AUTO_INCREMENT` value.
- `Create_time`

  When the table was created.
- `Update_time`

  When the data file was last updated. For some storage
  engines, this value is `NULL`. For example,
  `InnoDB` stores multiple tables in its
  [system
  tablespace](glossary.md#glos_system_tablespace "system tablespace") and the data file timestamp does not
  apply. Even with
  [file-per-table](glossary.md#glos_file_per_table "file-per-table")
  mode with each `InnoDB` table in a separate
  `.ibd` file,
  [change
  buffering](glossary.md#glos_change_buffering "change buffering") can delay the write to the data file, so
  the file modification time is different from the time of the
  last insert, update, or delete. For
  `MyISAM`, the data file timestamp is used;
  however, on Windows the timestamp is not updated by updates,
  so the value is inaccurate.

  `Update_time` displays a timestamp value
  for the last [`UPDATE`](update.md "15.2.17 UPDATE Statement"),
  [`INSERT`](insert.md "15.2.7 INSERT Statement"), or
  [`DELETE`](delete.md "15.2.2 DELETE Statement") performed on
  `InnoDB` tables that are not partitioned.
  For MVCC, the timestamp value reflects the
  [`COMMIT`](commit.md "15.3.1 START TRANSACTION, COMMIT, and ROLLBACK Statements") time, which is
  considered the last update time. Timestamps are not
  persisted when the server is restarted or when the table is
  evicted from the `InnoDB` data dictionary
  cache.
- `Check_time`

  When the table was last checked. Not all storage engines
  update this time, in which case, the value is always
  `NULL`.

  For partitioned [`InnoDB`](innodb-storage-engine.md "Chapter 17 The InnoDB Storage Engine") tables,
  `Check_time` is always
  `NULL`.
- `Collation`

  The table default collation. The output does not explicitly
  list the table default character set, but the collation name
  begins with the character set name.
- `Checksum`

  The live checksum value, if any.
- `Create_options`

  Extra options used with [`CREATE
  TABLE`](create-table.md "15.1.20 CREATE TABLE Statement").

  `Create_options` shows
  `partitioned` for a partitioned table.

  Prior to MySQL 8.0.16, `Create_options`
  shows the `ENCRYPTION` clause specified for
  tables created in file-per-table tablespaces. As of MySQL
  8.0.16, it shows the encryption clause for file-per-table
  tablespaces if the table is encrypted or if the specified
  encryption differs from the schema encryption. The
  encryption clause is not shown for tables created in general
  tablespaces. To identify encrypted file-per-table and
  general tablespaces, query the
  [`INNODB_TABLESPACES`](information-schema-innodb-tablespaces-table.md "28.4.24 The INFORMATION_SCHEMA INNODB_TABLESPACES Table")
  `ENCRYPTION` column.

  When creating a table with
  [strict mode](glossary.md#glos_strict_mode "strict mode")
  disabled, the storage engine's default row format is
  used if the specified row format is not supported. The
  actual row format of the table is reported in the
  `Row_format` column.
  `Create_options` shows the row format that
  was specified in the [`CREATE
  TABLE`](create-table.md "15.1.20 CREATE TABLE Statement") statement.

  When altering the storage engine of a table, table options
  that are not applicable to the new storage engine are
  retained in the table definition to enable reverting the
  table with its previously defined options to the original
  storage engine, if necessary.
  `Create_options` may show retained options.
- `Comment`

  The comment used when creating the table (or information as
  to why MySQL could not access the table information).

##### Notes

- For `InnoDB` tables,
  [`SHOW TABLE STATUS`](show-table-status.md "15.7.7.38 SHOW TABLE STATUS Statement") does not
  give accurate statistics except for the physical size
  reserved by the table. The row count is only a rough
  estimate used in SQL optimization.
- For [`NDB`](mysql-cluster.md "Chapter 25 MySQL NDB Cluster 8.0") tables, the output of
  this statement shows appropriate values for the
  `Avg_row_length` and
  `Data_length` columns, with the exception
  that [`BLOB`](blob.md "13.3.4 The BLOB and TEXT Types") columns are not
  taken into account.
- For [`NDB`](mysql-cluster.md "Chapter 25 MySQL NDB Cluster 8.0") tables,
  `Data_length` includes data stored in main
  memory only; the `Max_data_length` and
  `Data_free` columns apply to Disk Data.
- For NDB Cluster Disk Data tables,
  `Max_data_length` shows the space allocated
  for the disk part of a Disk Data table or fragment.
  (In-memory data resource usage is reported by the
  `Data_length` column.)
- For `MEMORY` tables, the
  `Data_length`,
  `Max_data_length`, and
  `Index_length` values approximate the
  actual amount of allocated memory. The allocation algorithm
  reserves memory in large amounts to reduce the number of
  allocation operations.
- For views, most columns displayed by
  [`SHOW TABLE STATUS`](show-table-status.md "15.7.7.38 SHOW TABLE STATUS Statement") are 0 or
  `NULL` except that `Name`
  indicates the view name, `Create_time`
  indicates the creation time, and `Comment`
  says `VIEW`.

Table information is also available from the
`INFORMATION_SCHEMA`
[`TABLES`](information-schema-tables-table.md "28.3.38 The INFORMATION_SCHEMA TABLES Table") table. See
[Section 28.3.38, “The INFORMATION\_SCHEMA TABLES Table”](information-schema-tables-table.md "28.3.38 The INFORMATION_SCHEMA TABLES Table").
