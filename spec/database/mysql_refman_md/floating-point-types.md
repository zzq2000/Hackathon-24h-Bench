### 13.1.4 Floating-Point Types (Approximate Value) - FLOAT, DOUBLE

The `FLOAT` and `DOUBLE` types
represent approximate numeric data values. MySQL uses four bytes
for single-precision values and eight bytes for double-precision
values.

For `FLOAT`, the SQL standard permits an
optional specification of the precision (but not the range of
the exponent) in bits following the keyword
`FLOAT` in parentheses, that is,
[`FLOAT(p)`](floating-point-types.md "13.1.4 Floating-Point Types (Approximate Value) - FLOAT, DOUBLE").
MySQL also supports this optional precision specification, but
the precision value in
[`FLOAT(p)`](floating-point-types.md "13.1.4 Floating-Point Types (Approximate Value) - FLOAT, DOUBLE")
is used only to determine storage size. A precision from 0 to 23
results in a 4-byte single-precision `FLOAT`
column. A precision from 24 to 53 results in an 8-byte
double-precision `DOUBLE` column.

MySQL permits a nonstandard syntax:
`FLOAT(M,D)`
or
`REAL(M,D)`
or `DOUBLE
PRECISION(M,D)`.
Here,
`(M,D)`
means than values can be stored with up to
*`M`* digits in total, of which
*`D`* digits may be after the decimal
point. For example, a column defined as
`FLOAT(7,4)` is displayed as
`-999.9999`. MySQL performs rounding when
storing values, so if you insert `999.00009`
into a `FLOAT(7,4)` column, the approximate
result is `999.0001`.

As of MySQL 8.0.17, the nonstandard
`FLOAT(M,D)`
and
`DOUBLE(M,D)`
syntax is deprecated and you should expect support for it to be
removed in a future version of MySQL.

Because floating-point values are approximate and not stored as
exact values, attempts to treat them as exact in comparisons may
lead to problems. They are also subject to platform or
implementation dependencies. For more information, see
[Section B.3.4.8, “Problems with Floating-Point Values”](problems-with-float.md "B.3.4.8 Problems with Floating-Point Values").

For maximum portability, code requiring storage of approximate
numeric data values should use `FLOAT` or
`DOUBLE PRECISION` with no specification of
precision or number of digits.
