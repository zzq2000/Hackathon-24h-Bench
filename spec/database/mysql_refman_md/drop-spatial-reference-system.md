### 15.1.31 DROP SPATIAL REFERENCE SYSTEM Statement

```sql
DROP SPATIAL REFERENCE SYSTEM
    [IF EXISTS]
    srid

srid: 32-bit unsigned integer
```

This statement removes a
[spatial reference
system](spatial-reference-systems.md "13.4.5 Spatial Reference System Support") (SRS) definition from the data dictionary. It
requires the [`SUPER`](privileges-provided.md#priv_super) privilege.

Example:

```sql
DROP SPATIAL REFERENCE SYSTEM 4120;
```

If no SRS definition with the SRID value exists, an error occurs
unless `IF EXISTS` is specified. In that case, a
warning occurs rather than an error.

If the SRID value is used by some column in an existing table, an
error occurs. For example:

```sql
mysql> DROP SPATIAL REFERENCE SYSTEM 4326;
ERROR 3716 (SR005): Can't modify SRID 4326. There is at
least one column depending on it.
```

To identify which column or columns use the SRID, use this query:

```sql
SELECT * FROM INFORMATION_SCHEMA.ST_GEOMETRY_COLUMNS WHERE SRS_ID=4326;
```

SRID values must be in the range of 32-bit unsigned integers, with
these restrictions:

- SRID 0 is a valid SRID but cannot be used with
  [`DROP SPATIAL REFERENCE SYSTEM`](drop-spatial-reference-system.md "15.1.31 DROP SPATIAL REFERENCE SYSTEM Statement").
- If the value is in a reserved SRID range, a warning occurs.
  Reserved ranges are [0, 32767] (reserved by EPSG),
  [60,000,000, 69,999,999] (reserved by EPSG), and
  [2,000,000,000, 2,147,483,647] (reserved by MySQL). EPSG
  stands for the [European Petroleum
  Survey Group](http://epsg.org).
- Users should not drop SRSs with SRIDs in the reserved ranges.
  If system-installed SRSs are dropped, the SRS definitions may
  be recreated for MySQL upgrades.
