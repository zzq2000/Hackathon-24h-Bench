### 12.14.1 Collation Implementation Types

MySQL implements several types of collations:

**Simple collations for 8-bit character
sets**

This kind of collation is implemented using an array of 256
weights that defines a one-to-one mapping from character codes
to weights. `latin1_swedish_ci` is an example.
It is a case-insensitive collation, so the uppercase and
lowercase versions of a character have the same weights and they
compare as equal.

```sql
mysql> SET NAMES 'latin1' COLLATE 'latin1_swedish_ci';
Query OK, 0 rows affected (0.01 sec)

mysql> SELECT HEX(WEIGHT_STRING('a')), HEX(WEIGHT_STRING('A'));
+-------------------------+-------------------------+
| HEX(WEIGHT_STRING('a')) | HEX(WEIGHT_STRING('A')) |
+-------------------------+-------------------------+
| 41                      | 41                      |
+-------------------------+-------------------------+
1 row in set (0.01 sec)

mysql> SELECT 'a' = 'A';
+-----------+
| 'a' = 'A' |
+-----------+
|         1 |
+-----------+
1 row in set (0.12 sec)
```

For implementation instructions, see
[Section 12.14.3, “Adding a Simple Collation to an 8-Bit Character Set”](adding-collation-simple-8bit.md "12.14.3 Adding a Simple Collation to an 8-Bit Character Set").

**Complex collations for 8-bit character
sets**

This kind of collation is implemented using functions in a C
source file that define how to order characters, as described in
[Section 12.13, “Adding a Character Set”](adding-character-set.md "12.13 Adding a Character Set").

**Collations for non-Unicode multibyte
character sets**

For this type of collation, 8-bit (single-byte) and multibyte
characters are handled differently. For 8-bit characters,
character codes map to weights in case-insensitive fashion. (For
example, the single-byte characters `'a'` and
`'A'` both have a weight of
`0x41`.) For multibyte characters, there are
two types of relationship between character codes and weights:

- Weights equal character codes.
  `sjis_japanese_ci` is an example of this
  kind of collation. The multibyte character
  `'ぢ'` has a character code of
  `0x82C0`, and the weight is also
  `0x82C0`.

  ```sql
  mysql> CREATE TABLE t1
         (c1 VARCHAR(2) CHARACTER SET sjis COLLATE sjis_japanese_ci);
  Query OK, 0 rows affected (0.01 sec)

  mysql> INSERT INTO t1 VALUES ('a'),('A'),(0x82C0);
  Query OK, 3 rows affected (0.00 sec)
  Records: 3  Duplicates: 0  Warnings: 0

  mysql> SELECT c1, HEX(c1), HEX(WEIGHT_STRING(c1)) FROM t1;
  +------+---------+------------------------+
  | c1   | HEX(c1) | HEX(WEIGHT_STRING(c1)) |
  +------+---------+------------------------+
  | a    | 61      | 41                     |
  | A    | 41      | 41                     |
  | ぢ    | 82C0    | 82C0                   |
  +------+---------+------------------------+
  3 rows in set (0.00 sec)
  ```
- Character codes map one-to-one to weights, but a code is not
  necessarily equal to the weight.
  `gbk_chinese_ci` is an example of this kind
  of collation. The multibyte character
  `'膰'` has a character code of
  `0x81B0` but a weight of
  `0xC286`.

  ```sql
  mysql> CREATE TABLE t1
         (c1 VARCHAR(2) CHARACTER SET gbk COLLATE gbk_chinese_ci);
  Query OK, 0 rows affected (0.33 sec)

  mysql> INSERT INTO t1 VALUES ('a'),('A'),(0x81B0);
  Query OK, 3 rows affected (0.00 sec)
  Records: 3  Duplicates: 0  Warnings: 0

  mysql> SELECT c1, HEX(c1), HEX(WEIGHT_STRING(c1)) FROM t1;
  +------+---------+------------------------+
  | c1   | HEX(c1) | HEX(WEIGHT_STRING(c1)) |
  +------+---------+------------------------+
  | a    | 61      | 41                     |
  | A    | 41      | 41                     |
  | 膰    | 81B0    | C286                   |
  +------+---------+------------------------+
  3 rows in set (0.00 sec)
  ```

For implementation instructions, see
[Section 12.13, “Adding a Character Set”](adding-character-set.md "12.13 Adding a Character Set").

**Collations for Unicode multibyte character
sets**

Some of these collations are based on the Unicode Collation
Algorithm (UCA), others are not.

Non-UCA collations have a one-to-one mapping from character code
to weight. In MySQL, such collations are case-insensitive and
accent-insensitive. `utf8mb4_general_ci` is an
example: `'a'`, `'A'`,
`'À'`, and `'á'` each have
different character codes but all have a weight of
`0x0041` and compare as equal.

```sql
mysql> SET NAMES 'utf8mb4' COLLATE 'utf8mb4_general_ci';
Query OK, 0 rows affected (0.00 sec)

mysql> CREATE TABLE t1
       (c1 CHAR(1) CHARACTER SET UTF8MB4 COLLATE utf8mb4_general_ci);
Query OK, 0 rows affected (0.01 sec)

mysql> INSERT INTO t1 VALUES ('a'),('A'),('À'),('á');
Query OK, 4 rows affected (0.00 sec)
Records: 4  Duplicates: 0  Warnings: 0

mysql> SELECT c1, HEX(c1), HEX(WEIGHT_STRING(c1)) FROM t1;
+------+---------+------------------------+
| c1   | HEX(c1) | HEX(WEIGHT_STRING(c1)) |
+------+---------+------------------------+
| a    | 61      | 0041                   |
| A    | 41      | 0041                   |
| À    | C380    | 0041                   |
| á    | C3A1    | 0041                   |
+------+---------+------------------------+
4 rows in set (0.00 sec)
```

UCA-based collations in MySQL have these properties:

- If a character has weights, each weight uses 2 bytes (16
  bits).
- A character may have zero weights (or an empty weight). In
  this case, the character is ignorable. Example: "U+0000
  NULL" does not have a weight and is ignorable.
- A character may have one weight. Example:
  `'a'` has a weight of
  `0x0E33`.

  ```sql
  mysql> SET NAMES 'utf8mb4' COLLATE 'utf8mb4_unicode_ci';
  Query OK, 0 rows affected (0.05 sec)

  mysql> SELECT HEX('a'), HEX(WEIGHT_STRING('a'));
  +----------+-------------------------+
  | HEX('a') | HEX(WEIGHT_STRING('a')) |
  +----------+-------------------------+
  | 61       | 0E33                    |
  +----------+-------------------------+
  1 row in set (0.02 sec)
  ```
- A character may have many weights. This is an expansion.
  Example: The German letter `'ß'` (SZ
  ligature, or SHARP S) has a weight of
  `0x0FEA0FEA`.

  ```sql
  mysql> SET NAMES 'utf8mb4' COLLATE 'utf8mb4_unicode_ci';
  Query OK, 0 rows affected (0.11 sec)

  mysql> SELECT HEX('ß'), HEX(WEIGHT_STRING('ß'));
  +-----------+--------------------------+
  | HEX('ß')  | HEX(WEIGHT_STRING('ß'))  |
  +-----------+--------------------------+
  | C39F      | 0FEA0FEA                 |
  +-----------+--------------------------+
  1 row in set (0.00 sec)
  ```
- Many characters may have one weight. This is a contraction.
  Example: `'ch'` is a single letter in Czech
  and has a weight of `0x0EE2`.

  ```sql
  mysql> SET NAMES 'utf8mb4' COLLATE 'utf8mb4_czech_ci';
  Query OK, 0 rows affected (0.09 sec)

  mysql> SELECT HEX('ch'), HEX(WEIGHT_STRING('ch'));
  +-----------+--------------------------+
  | HEX('ch') | HEX(WEIGHT_STRING('ch')) |
  +-----------+--------------------------+
  | 6368      | 0EE2                     |
  +-----------+--------------------------+
  1 row in set (0.00 sec)
  ```

A many-characters-to-many-weights mapping is also possible (this
is contraction with expansion), but is not supported by MySQL.

For implementation instructions, for a non-UCA collation, see
[Section 12.13, “Adding a Character Set”](adding-character-set.md "12.13 Adding a Character Set"). For a UCA collation, see
[Section 12.14.4, “Adding a UCA Collation to a Unicode Character Set”](adding-collation-unicode-uca.md "12.14.4 Adding a UCA Collation to a Unicode Character Set").

**Miscellaneous collations**

There are also a few collations that do not fall into any of the
previous categories.
