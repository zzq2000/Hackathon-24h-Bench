#### 19.5.1.31 Replication and Temporary Tables

In MySQL 8.0, when
[`binlog_format`](replication-options-binary-log.md#sysvar_binlog_format) is set to
`ROW` or `MIXED`, statements
that exclusively use temporary tables are not logged on the
source, and therefore the temporary tables are not replicated.
Statements that involve a mix of temporary and nontemporary
tables are logged on the source only for the operations on
nontemporary tables, and the operations on temporary tables are
not logged. This means that there are never any temporary tables
on the replica to be lost in the event of an unplanned shutdown
by the replica. For more information about row-based replication
and temporary tables, see
[Row-based logging of temporary tables](replication-rbr-usage.md#replication-rbr-usage-temptables "Row-based logging of temporary tables").

When [`binlog_format`](replication-options-binary-log.md#sysvar_binlog_format) is set to
`STATEMENT`, operations on temporary tables are
logged on the source and replicated on the replica, provided
that the statements involving temporary tables can be logged
safely using statement-based format. In this situation, loss of
replicated temporary tables on the replica can be an issue. In
statement-based replication mode,
[`CREATE TEMPORARY
TABLE`](create-table.md "15.1.20 CREATE TABLE Statement") and
[`DROP TEMPORARY
TABLE`](drop-table.md "15.1.32 DROP TABLE Statement") statements cannot be used inside a transaction,
procedure, function, or trigger when GTIDs are in use on the
server (that is, when the
[`enforce_gtid_consistency`](replication-options-gtids.md#sysvar_enforce_gtid_consistency) system
variable is set to `ON`). They can be used
outside these contexts when GTIDs are in use, provided that
[`autocommit=1`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_autocommit) is set.

Because of the differences in behavior between row-based or
mixed replication mode and statement-based replication mode
regarding temporary tables, you cannot switch the replication
format at runtime, if the change applies to a context (global or
session) that contains any open temporary tables. For more
details, see the description of the
[`binlog_format`](replication-options-binary-log.md#sysvar_binlog_format) option.

**Safe replica shutdown when using temporary tables.**
In statement-based replication mode, temporary tables are
replicated except in the case where you stop the replica
server (not just the replication threads) and you have
replicated temporary tables that are open for use in updates
that have not yet been executed on the replica. If you stop
the replica server, the temporary tables needed by those
updates are no longer available when the replica is restarted.
To avoid this problem, do not shut down the replica while it
has temporary tables open. Instead, use the following
procedure:

1. Issue a `STOP REPLICA
   SQL_THREAD` statement.
2. Use [`SHOW STATUS`](show-status.md "15.7.7.37 SHOW STATUS Statement") to check the
   value of the
   [`Replica_open_temp_tables`](server-status-variables.md#statvar_Replica_open_temp_tables)
   or [`Slave_open_temp_tables`](server-status-variables.md#statvar_Slave_open_temp_tables)
   status variable.
3. If the value is not 0, restart the replication SQL thread
   with `START REPLICA
   SQL_THREAD` and repeat the procedure later.
4. When the value is 0, issue a [**mysqladmin
   shutdown**](mysqladmin.md "6.5.2 mysqladmin — A MySQL Server Administration Program") command to stop the replica.

**Temporary tables and replication options.**
By default, with statement-based replication, all temporary
tables are replicated; this happens whether or not there are
any matching [`--replicate-do-db`](replication-options-replica.md#option_mysqld_replicate-do-db),
[`--replicate-do-table`](replication-options-replica.md#option_mysqld_replicate-do-table), or
[`--replicate-wild-do-table`](replication-options-replica.md#option_mysqld_replicate-wild-do-table)
options in effect. However, the
[`--replicate-ignore-table`](replication-options-replica.md#option_mysqld_replicate-ignore-table) and
[`--replicate-wild-ignore-table`](replication-options-replica.md#option_mysqld_replicate-wild-ignore-table)
options are honored for temporary tables. The exception is
that to enable correct removal of temporary tables at the end
of a session, a replica always replicates a `DROP
TEMPORARY TABLE IF EXISTS` statement, regardless of
any exclusion rules that would normally apply for the
specified table.

A recommended practice when using statement-based replication is
to designate a prefix for exclusive use in naming temporary
tables that you do not want replicated, then employ a
[`--replicate-wild-ignore-table`](replication-options-replica.md#option_mysqld_replicate-wild-ignore-table)
option to match that prefix. For example, you might give all
such tables names beginning with `norep` (such
as `norepmytable`,
`norepyourtable`, and so on), then use
[`--replicate-wild-ignore-table=norep%`](replication-options-replica.md#option_mysqld_replicate-wild-ignore-table)
to prevent them from being replicated.
