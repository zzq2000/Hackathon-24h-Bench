#### 30.4.3.13 The io\_global\_by\_wait\_by\_bytes and x$io\_global\_by\_wait\_by\_bytes Views

These views summarize global I/O consumers to display amount
of I/O and time waiting for I/O, grouped by event. By default,
rows are sorted by descending total I/O (bytes read and
written).

The [`io_global_by_wait_by_bytes`](sys-io-global-by-wait-by-bytes.md "30.4.3.13 The io_global_by_wait_by_bytes and x$io_global_by_wait_by_bytes Views")
and [`x$io_global_by_wait_by_bytes`](sys-io-global-by-wait-by-bytes.md "30.4.3.13 The io_global_by_wait_by_bytes and x$io_global_by_wait_by_bytes Views")
views have these columns:

- `event_name`

  The I/O event name, with the
  `wait/io/file/` prefix stripped.
- `total`

  The total number of occurrences of the I/O event.
- `total_latency`

  The total wait time of timed occurrences of the I/O event.
- `min_latency`

  The minimum single wait time of timed occurrences of the
  I/O event.
- `avg_latency`

  The average wait time per timed occurrence of the I/O
  event.
- `max_latency`

  The maximum single wait time of timed occurrences of the
  I/O event.
- `count_read`

  The number of read requests for the I/O event.
- `total_read`

  The number of bytes read for the I/O event.
- `avg_read`

  The average number of bytes per read for the I/O event.
- `count_write`

  The number of write requests for the I/O event.
- `total_written`

  The number of bytes written for the I/O event.
- `avg_written`

  The average number of bytes per write for the I/O event.
- `total_requested`

  The total number of bytes read and written for the I/O
  event.
