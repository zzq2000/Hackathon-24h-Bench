### 8.2.5 Specifying Role Names

MySQL role names refer to roles, which are named collections of
privileges. For role usage examples, see [Section 8.2.10, “Using Roles”](roles.md "8.2.10 Using Roles").

Role names have syntax and semantics similar to account names; see
[Section 8.2.4, “Specifying Account Names”](account-names.md "8.2.4 Specifying Account Names"). As stored in the grant tables,
they have the same properties as account names, which are
described in
[Grant Table Scope Column Properties](grant-tables.md#grant-tables-scope-column-properties "Grant Table Scope Column Properties").

Role names differ from account names in these respects:

- The user part of role names cannot be blank. Thus, there is no
  “anonymous role” analogous to the concept of
  “anonymous user.”
- As for an account name, omitting the host part of a role name
  results in a host part of `'%'`. But unlike
  `'%'` in an account name, a host part of
  `'%'` in a role name has no wildcard
  properties. For example, for a name
  `'me'@'%'` used as a role name, the host part
  (`'%'`) is just a literal value; it has no
  “any host” matching property.
- Netmask notation in the host part of a role name has no
  significance.
- An account name is permitted to be
  [`CURRENT_USER()`](information-functions.md#function_current-user) in several
  contexts. A role name is not.

It is possible for a row in the `mysql.user`
system table to serve as both an account and a role. In this case,
any special user or host name matching properties do not apply in
contexts for which the name is used as a role name. For example,
you cannot execute the following statement with the expectation
that it sets the current session roles using all roles that have a
user part of `myrole` and any host name:

```sql
SET ROLE 'myrole'@'%';
```

Instead, the statement sets the active role for the session to the
role with exactly the name `'myrole'@'%'`.

For this reason, role names are often specified using only the
user name part and letting the host name part implicitly be
`'%'`. Specifying a role with a
non-`'%'` host part can be useful if you intend
to create a name that works both as a role an as a user account
that is permitted to connect from the given host.
