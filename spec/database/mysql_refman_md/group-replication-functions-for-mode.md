#### 14.18.1.2 Functions which Configure the Group Replication Mode

The following functions enable you to control the mode which a
replication group is running in, either single-primary or
multi-primary mode.

- [`group_replication_switch_to_multi_primary_mode()`](group-replication-functions-for-mode.md#function_group-replication-switch-to-multi-primary-mode)

  Changes a group running in single-primary mode to
  multi-primary mode. Must be issued on a member of a
  replication group running in single-primary mode.

  Syntax:

  ```clike
  STRING group_replication_switch_to_multi_primary_mode()
  ```

  This function has no parameters.

  Return value:

  A string containing the result of the operation, for
  example whether it was successful or not.

  Example:

  ```sql
  SELECT group_replication_switch_to_multi_primary_mode()
  ```

  All members which belong to the group become primaries.

  For more information, see
  [Section 20.5.1.2, “Changing the Group Mode”](group-replication-changing-group-mode.md "20.5.1.2 Changing the Group Mode")
- [`group_replication_switch_to_single_primary_mode()`](group-replication-functions-for-mode.md#function_group-replication-switch-to-single-primary-mode)

  Changes a group running in multi-primary mode to
  single-primary mode, without the need to stop Group
  Replication. Must be issued on a member of a replication
  group running in multi-primary mode. When you change to
  single-primary mode, strict consistency checks are also
  disabled on all group members, as required in
  single-primary mode
  ([`group_replication_enforce_update_everywhere_checks=OFF`](group-replication-system-variables.md#sysvar_group_replication_enforce_update_everywhere_checks)).

  Syntax:

  ```clike
  STRING group_replication_switch_to_single_primary_mode([str])
  ```

  Arguments:

  - *`str`*: A string containing
    the UUID of a member of the group which should become
    the new single primary. Other members of the group
    become secondaries.

  Return value:

  A string containing the result of the operation, for
  example whether it was successful or not.

  Example:

  ```sql
  SELECT group_replication_switch_to_single_primary_mode(member_uuid);
  ```

  For more information, see
  [Section 20.5.1.2, “Changing the Group Mode”](group-replication-changing-group-mode.md "20.5.1.2 Changing the Group Mode")
