### 25.7.6 Starting NDB Cluster Replication (Single Replication Channel)

This section outlines the procedure for starting NDB Cluster
replication using a single replication channel.

1. Start the MySQL replication source server by issuing this
   command, where *`id`* is this
   server's unique ID (see
   [Section 25.7.2, “General Requirements for NDB Cluster Replication”](mysql-cluster-replication-general.md "25.7.2 General Requirements for NDB Cluster Replication")):

   ```terminal
   shellS> mysqld --ndbcluster --server-id=id \
           --log-bin --ndb-log-bin &
   ```

   This starts the server's [**mysqld**](mysqld.md "6.3.1 mysqld — The MySQL Server")
   process with binary logging enabled using the proper logging
   format. It is also necessary in NDB 8.0 to enable logging of
   updates to `NDB` tables explicitly, using the
   [`--ndb-log-bin`](mysql-cluster-options-variables.md#sysvar_ndb_log_bin) option; this is a
   change from previous versions of NDB Cluster, in which this
   option was enabled by default.

   Note

   You can also start the source with
   [`--binlog-format=MIXED`](replication-options-binary-log.md#sysvar_binlog_format), in
   which case row-based replication is used automatically when
   replicating between clusters. Statement-based binary logging
   is not supported for NDB Cluster Replication (see
   [Section 25.7.2, “General Requirements for NDB Cluster Replication”](mysql-cluster-replication-general.md "25.7.2 General Requirements for NDB Cluster Replication")).
2. Start the MySQL replica server as shown here:

   ```terminal
   shellR> mysqld --ndbcluster --server-id=id &
   ```

   In the command just shown, *`id`* is
   the replica server's unique ID. It is not necessary to
   enable logging on the replica.

   Note

   Unless you want replication to begin immediately, delay the
   start of the replication threads until the appropriate
   [`START REPLICA`](start-replica.md "15.4.2.6 START REPLICA Statement") statement has
   been issued, as explained in Step 4 below. You can do this
   by starting the replica with the
   [`--skip-slave-start`](replication-options-replica.md#option_mysqld_skip-slave-start) option on
   the command line, by including
   `skip-slave-start` in the replica's
   `my.cnf` file, or in NDB 8.0.24 and
   later, by setting the
   [`skip_slave_start`](replication-options-replica.md#sysvar_skip_slave_start) system
   variable. In NDB 8.0.26 and later, use
   [`--skip-replica-start`](replication-options-replica.md#option_mysqld_skip-replica-start) and
   [`skip_replica_start`](replication-options-replica.md#sysvar_skip_replica_start).
3. It is necessary to synchronize the replica server with the
   source server's replication binary log. If binary logging
   has not previously been running on the source, run the
   following statement on the replica:

   ```sql
   mysqlR> CHANGE MASTER TO
        -> MASTER_LOG_FILE='',
        -> MASTER_LOG_POS=4;
   ```

   Beginning with NDB 8.0.23, you can also use the following
   statement:

   ```sql
   mysqlR> CHANGE REPLICATION SOURCE TO
        -> SOURCE_LOG_FILE='',
        -> SOURCE_LOG_POS=4;
   ```

   This instructs the replica to begin reading the source
   server's binary log from the log's starting point.
   Otherwise—that is, if you are loading data from the
   source using a backup—see
   [Section 25.7.8, “Implementing Failover with NDB Cluster Replication”](mysql-cluster-replication-failover.md "25.7.8 Implementing Failover with NDB Cluster Replication"), for
   information on how to obtain the correct values to use for
   `SOURCE_LOG_FILE` |
   `MASTER_LOG_FILE` and
   `SOURCE_LOG_POS` |
   `MASTER_LOG_POS` in such cases.
4. Finally, instruct the replica to begin applying replication by
   issuing this command from the [**mysql**](mysql.md "6.5.1 mysql — The MySQL Command-Line Client") client
   on the replica:

   ```sql
   mysqlR> START SLAVE;
   ```

   In NDB 8.0.22 and later, you can also use the following
   statement:

   ```sql
   mysqlR> START REPLICA;
   ```

   This also initiates the transmission of data and changes from
   the source to the replica.

It is also possible to use two replication channels, in a manner
similar to the procedure described in the next section; the
differences between this and using a single replication channel
are covered in
[Section 25.7.7, “Using Two Replication Channels for NDB Cluster Replication”](mysql-cluster-replication-two-channels.md "25.7.7 Using Two Replication Channels for NDB Cluster Replication").

It is also possible to improve cluster replication performance by
enabling batched updates.
This can be accomplished by setting the system variable
[`replica_allow_batching`](mysql-cluster-options-variables.md#sysvar_replica_allow_batching) (NDB
8.0.26 and later) or
[`slave_allow_batching`](mysql-cluster-options-variables.md#sysvar_slave_allow_batching) (prior to
NDB 8.0.26) on the replicas' [**mysqld**](mysqld.md "6.3.1 mysqld — The MySQL Server")
processes. Normally, updates are applied as soon as they are
received. However, the use of batching causes updates to be
applied in batches of 32 KB each; this can result in higher
throughput and less CPU usage, particularly where individual
updates are relatively small.

Note

Batching works on a per-epoch basis; updates belonging to more
than one transaction can be sent as part of the same batch.

All outstanding updates are applied when the end of an epoch is
reached, even if the updates total less than 32 KB.

Batching can be turned on and off at runtime. To activate it at
runtime, you can use either of these two statements:

```sql
SET GLOBAL slave_allow_batching = 1;
SET GLOBAL slave_allow_batching = ON;
```

Beginning with NDB 8.0.26, you can (and should) use one of the
following statements:

```sql
SET GLOBAL replica_allow_batching = 1;
SET GLOBAL replica_allow_batching = ON;
```

If a particular batch causes problems (such as a statement whose
effects do not appear to be replicated correctly), batching can be
deactivated using either of the following statements:

```sql
SET GLOBAL slave_allow_batching = 0;
SET GLOBAL slave_allow_batching = OFF;
```

Beginning with NDB 8.0.26, you can (and should) use one of the
following statements instead:

```sql
SET GLOBAL replica_allow_batching = 0;
SET GLOBAL replica_allow_batching = OFF;
```

You can check whether batching is currently being used by means of
an appropriate [`SHOW VARIABLES`](show-variables.md "15.7.7.41 SHOW VARIABLES Statement")
statement, like this one:

```sql
mysql> SHOW VARIABLES LIKE 'slave%';
```

In ŃDB 8.0.26 and later, use the following statement:

```sql
mysql> SHOW VARIABLES LIKE 'replica%';
```
