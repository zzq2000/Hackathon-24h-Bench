#### 17.6.1.3 Importing InnoDB Tables

This section describes how to import tables using the
*Transportable Tablespaces* feature, which
permits importing tables, partitioned tables, or individual table
partitions that reside in file-per-table tablespaces. There are
many reasons why you might want to import tables:

- To run reports on a non-production MySQL server instance to
  avoid placing extra load on a production server.
- To copy data to a new replica server.
- To restore a table from a backed-up tablespace file.
- As a faster way of moving data than importing a dump file,
  which requires reinserting data and rebuilding indexes.
- To move a data to a server with storage media that is better
  suited to your storage requirements. For example, you might
  move busy tables to an SSD device, or move large tables to a
  high-capacity HDD device.

The *Transportable Tablespaces* feature is
described under the following topics in this section:

- [Prerequisites](innodb-table-import.md#innodb-table-import-prerequsites "Prerequisites")
- [Importing Tables](innodb-table-import.md#innodb-table-import-example "Importing Tables")
- [Importing Partitioned Tables](innodb-table-import.md#innodb-table-import-partitioned-table "Importing Partitioned Tables")
- [Importing Table Partitions](innodb-table-import.md#innodb-table-import-partitions "Importing Table Partitions")
- [Limitations](innodb-table-import.md#innodb-table-import-limitations "Limitations")
- [Usage Notes](innodb-table-import.md#innodb-table-import-usage-notes "Usage Notes")
- [Internals](innodb-table-import.md#innodb-table-import-internals "Internals")

##### Prerequisites

- The [`innodb_file_per_table`](innodb-parameters.md#sysvar_innodb_file_per_table)
  variable must be enabled, which it is by default.
- The page size of the tablespace must match the page size of
  the destination MySQL server instance.
  `InnoDB` page size is defined by the
  [`innodb_page_size`](innodb-parameters.md#sysvar_innodb_page_size) variable,
  which is configured when initializing a MySQL server
  instance.
- If the table has a foreign key relationship,
  [`foreign_key_checks`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_foreign_key_checks) must be
  disabled before executing `DISCARD
  TABLESPACE`. Also, you should export all foreign
  key related tables at the same logical point in time, as
  [`ALTER TABLE ...
  IMPORT TABLESPACE`](alter-table.md "15.1.9 ALTER TABLE Statement") does not enforce foreign key
  constraints on imported data. To do so, stop updating the
  related tables, commit all transactions, acquire shared
  locks on the tables, and perform the export operations.
- When importing a table from another MySQL server instance,
  both MySQL server instances must have General Availability
  (GA) status and must be the same version. Otherwise, the
  table must be created on the same MySQL server instance into
  which it is being imported.
- If the table was created in an external directory by
  specifying the `DATA DIRECTORY` clause in
  the [`CREATE TABLE`](create-table.md "15.1.20 CREATE TABLE Statement") statement,
  the table that you replace on the destination instance must
  be defined with the same `DATA DIRECTORY`
  clause. A schema mismatch error is reported if the clauses
  do not match. To determine if the source table was defined
  with a `DATA DIRECTORY` clause, use
  [`SHOW CREATE TABLE`](show-create-table.md "15.7.7.10 SHOW CREATE TABLE Statement") to view the
  table definition. For information about using the
  `DATA DIRECTORY` clause, see
  [Section 17.6.1.2, “Creating Tables Externally”](innodb-create-table-external.md "17.6.1.2 Creating Tables Externally").
- If a `ROW_FORMAT` option is not defined
  explicitly in the table definition or
  `ROW_FORMAT=DEFAULT` is used, the
  [`innodb_default_row_format`](innodb-parameters.md#sysvar_innodb_default_row_format)
  setting must be the same on the source and destination
  instances. Otherwise, a schema mismatch error is reported
  when you attempt the import operation. Use
  [`SHOW CREATE TABLE`](show-create-table.md "15.7.7.10 SHOW CREATE TABLE Statement") to check
  the table definition. Use [`SHOW
  VARIABLES`](show-variables.md "15.7.7.41 SHOW VARIABLES Statement") to check the
  [`innodb_default_row_format`](innodb-parameters.md#sysvar_innodb_default_row_format)
  setting. For related information, see
  [Defining the Row Format of a Table](innodb-row-format.md#innodb-row-format-defining "Defining the Row Format of a Table").

##### Importing Tables

This example demonstrates how to import a regular
non-partitioned table that resides in a file-per-table
tablespace.

1. On the destination instance, create a table with the same
   definition as the table you intend to import. (You can
   obtain the table definition using [`SHOW
   CREATE TABLE`](show-create-table.md "15.7.7.10 SHOW CREATE TABLE Statement") syntax.) If the table definition does
   not match, a schema mismatch error is reported when you
   attempt the import operation.

   ```sql
   mysql> USE test;
   mysql> CREATE TABLE t1 (c1 INT) ENGINE=INNODB;
   ```
2. On the destination instance, discard the tablespace of the
   table that you just created. (Before importing, you must
   discard the tablespace of the receiving table.)

   ```sql
   mysql> ALTER TABLE t1 DISCARD TABLESPACE;
   ```
3. On the source instance, run
   [`FLUSH
   TABLES ... FOR EXPORT`](flush.md#flush-tables-for-export-with-list) to quiesce the table you
   intend to import. When a table is quiesced, only read-only
   transactions are permitted on the table.

   ```sql
   mysql> USE test;
   mysql> FLUSH TABLES t1 FOR EXPORT;
   ```

   [`FLUSH
   TABLES ... FOR EXPORT`](flush.md#flush-tables-for-export-with-list) ensures that changes to the
   named table are flushed to disk so that a binary table copy
   can be made while the server is running. When
   [`FLUSH
   TABLES ... FOR EXPORT`](flush.md#flush-tables-for-export-with-list) is run,
   `InnoDB` generates a
   `.cfg` metadata file in the schema
   directory of the table. The `.cfg` file
   contains metadata that is used for schema verification
   during the import operation.

   Note

   The connection executing
   [`FLUSH
   TABLES ... FOR EXPORT`](flush.md#flush-tables-for-export-with-list) must remain open while the
   operation is running; otherwise, the
   `.cfg` file is removed as locks are
   released upon connection closure.
4. Copy the `.ibd` file and
   `.cfg` metadata file from the source
   instance to the destination instance. For example:

   ```terminal
   $> scp /path/to/datadir/test/t1.{ibd,cfg} destination-server:/path/to/datadir/test
   ```

   The `.ibd` file and
   `.cfg` file must be copied before
   releasing the shared locks, as described in the next step.

   Note

   If you are importing a table from an encrypted tablespace,
   `InnoDB` generates a
   `.cfp` file in addition to a
   `.cfg` metadata file. The
   `.cfp` file must be copied to the
   destination instance together with the
   `.cfg` file. The
   `.cfp` file contains a transfer key and
   an encrypted tablespace key. On import,
   `InnoDB` uses the transfer key to decrypt
   the tablespace key. For related information, see
   [Section 17.13, “InnoDB Data-at-Rest Encryption”](innodb-data-encryption.md "17.13 InnoDB Data-at-Rest Encryption").
5. On the source instance, use
   [`UNLOCK
   TABLES`](lock-tables.md "15.3.6 LOCK TABLES and UNLOCK TABLES Statements") to release the locks acquired by the
   [`FLUSH
   TABLES ... FOR EXPORT`](flush.md#flush-tables-for-export-with-list) statement:

   ```sql
   mysql> USE test;
   mysql> UNLOCK TABLES;
   ```

   The [`UNLOCK
   TABLES`](lock-tables.md "15.3.6 LOCK TABLES and UNLOCK TABLES Statements") operation also removes the
   `.cfg` file.
6. On the destination instance, import the tablespace:

   ```sql
   mysql> USE test;
   mysql> ALTER TABLE t1 IMPORT TABLESPACE;
   ```

##### Importing Partitioned Tables

This example demonstrates how to import a partitioned table,
where each table partition resides in a file-per-table
tablespace.

1. On the destination instance, create a partitioned table with
   the same definition as the partitioned table that you want
   to import. (You can obtain the table definition using
   [`SHOW CREATE TABLE`](show-create-table.md "15.7.7.10 SHOW CREATE TABLE Statement") syntax.) If
   the table definition does not match, a schema mismatch error
   is reported when you attempt the import operation.

   ```sql
   mysql> USE test;
   mysql> CREATE TABLE t1 (i int) ENGINE = InnoDB PARTITION BY KEY (i) PARTITIONS 3;
   ```

   In the
   `/datadir/test`
   directory, there is a tablespace `.ibd`
   file for each of the three partitions.

   ```terminal
   mysql> \! ls /path/to/datadir/test/
   t1#p#p0.ibd  t1#p#p1.ibd  t1#p#p2.ibd
   ```
2. On the destination instance, discard the tablespace for the
   partitioned table. (Before the import operation, you must
   discard the tablespace of the receiving table.)

   ```sql
   mysql> ALTER TABLE t1 DISCARD TABLESPACE;
   ```

   The three tablespace `.ibd` files of the
   partitioned table are discarded from the
   `/datadir/test`
   directory.
3. On the source instance, run
   [`FLUSH
   TABLES ... FOR EXPORT`](flush.md#flush-tables-for-export-with-list) to quiesce the partitioned
   table that you intend to import. When a table is quiesced,
   only read-only transactions are permitted on the table.

   ```sql
   mysql> USE test;
   mysql> FLUSH TABLES t1 FOR EXPORT;
   ```

   [`FLUSH
   TABLES ... FOR EXPORT`](flush.md#flush-tables-for-export-with-list) ensures that changes to the
   named table are flushed to disk so that binary table copy
   can be made while the server is running. When
   [`FLUSH
   TABLES ... FOR EXPORT`](flush.md#flush-tables-for-export-with-list) is run,
   `InnoDB` generates
   `.cfg` metadata files in the schema
   directory of the table for each of the table's tablespace
   files.

   ```terminal
   mysql> \! ls /path/to/datadir/test/
   t1#p#p0.ibd  t1#p#p1.ibd  t1#p#p2.ibd
   t1#p#p0.cfg  t1#p#p1.cfg  t1#p#p2.cfg
   ```

   The `.cfg` files contain metadata that is
   used for schema verification when importing the tablespace.
   [`FLUSH
   TABLES ... FOR EXPORT`](flush.md#flush-tables-for-export-with-list) can only be run on the
   table, not on individual table partitions.
4. Copy the `.ibd` and
   `.cfg` files from the source instance
   schema directory to the destination instance schema
   directory. For example:

   ```terminal
   $>scp /path/to/datadir/test/t1*.{ibd,cfg} destination-server:/path/to/datadir/test
   ```

   The `.ibd` and `.cfg`
   files must be copied before releasing the shared locks, as
   described in the next step.

   Note

   If you are importing a table from an encrypted tablespace,
   `InnoDB` generates a
   `.cfp` files in addition to a
   `.cfg` metadata files. The
   `.cfp` files must be copied to the
   destination instance together with the
   `.cfg` files. The
   `.cfp` files contain a transfer key and
   an encrypted tablespace key. On import,
   `InnoDB` uses the transfer key to decrypt
   the tablespace key. For related information, see
   [Section 17.13, “InnoDB Data-at-Rest Encryption”](innodb-data-encryption.md "17.13 InnoDB Data-at-Rest Encryption").
5. On the source instance, use
   [`UNLOCK
   TABLES`](lock-tables.md "15.3.6 LOCK TABLES and UNLOCK TABLES Statements") to release the locks acquired by
   [`FLUSH
   TABLES ... FOR EXPORT`](flush.md#flush-tables-for-export-with-list):

   ```sql
   mysql> USE test;
   mysql> UNLOCK TABLES;
   ```
6. On the destination instance, import the tablespace of the
   partitioned table:

   ```sql
   mysql> USE test;
   mysql> ALTER TABLE t1 IMPORT TABLESPACE;
   ```

##### Importing Table Partitions

This example demonstrates how to import individual table
partitions, where each partition resides in a file-per-table
tablespace file.

In the following example, two partitions (`p2`
and `p3`) of a four-partition table are
imported.

1. On the destination instance, create a partitioned table with
   the same definition as the partitioned table that you want
   to import partitions from. (You can obtain the table
   definition using [`SHOW CREATE
   TABLE`](show-create-table.md "15.7.7.10 SHOW CREATE TABLE Statement") syntax.) If the table definition does not
   match, a schema mismatch error is reported when you attempt
   the import operation.

   ```sql
   mysql> USE test;
   mysql> CREATE TABLE t1 (i int) ENGINE = InnoDB PARTITION BY KEY (i) PARTITIONS 4;
   ```

   In the
   `/datadir/test`
   directory, there is a tablespace `.ibd`
   file for each of the four partitions.

   ```terminal
   mysql> \! ls /path/to/datadir/test/
   t1#p#p0.ibd  t1#p#p1.ibd  t1#p#p2.ibd t1#p#p3.ibd
   ```
2. On the destination instance, discard the partitions that you
   intend to import from the source instance. (Before importing
   partitions, you must discard the corresponding partitions
   from the receiving partitioned table.)

   ```sql
   mysql> ALTER TABLE t1 DISCARD PARTITION p2, p3 TABLESPACE;
   ```

   The tablespace `.ibd` files for the two
   discarded partitions are removed from the
   `/datadir/test`
   directory on the destination instance, leaving the following
   files:

   ```terminal
   mysql> \! ls /path/to/datadir/test/
   t1#p#p0.ibd  t1#p#p1.ibd
   ```

   Note

   When [`ALTER
   TABLE ... DISCARD PARTITION ... TABLESPACE`](alter-table.md "15.1.9 ALTER TABLE Statement") is
   run on subpartitioned tables, both partition and
   subpartition table names are permitted. When a partition
   name is specified, subpartitions of that partition are
   included in the operation.
3. On the source instance, run
   [`FLUSH
   TABLES ... FOR EXPORT`](flush.md#flush-tables-for-export-with-list) to quiesce the partitioned
   table. When a table is quiesced, only read-only transactions
   are permitted on the table.

   ```sql
   mysql> USE test;
   mysql> FLUSH TABLES t1 FOR EXPORT;
   ```

   [`FLUSH
   TABLES ... FOR EXPORT`](flush.md#flush-tables-for-export-with-list) ensures that changes to the
   named table are flushed to disk so that binary table copy
   can be made while the instance is running. When
   [`FLUSH
   TABLES ... FOR EXPORT`](flush.md#flush-tables-for-export-with-list) is run,
   `InnoDB` generates a
   `.cfg` metadata file for each of the
   table's tablespace files in the schema directory of the
   table.

   ```terminal
   mysql> \! ls /path/to/datadir/test/
   t1#p#p0.ibd  t1#p#p1.ibd  t1#p#p2.ibd t1#p#p3.ibd
   t1#p#p0.cfg  t1#p#p1.cfg  t1#p#p2.cfg t1#p#p3.cfg
   ```

   The `.cfg` files contain metadata that
   used for schema verification during the import operation.
   [`FLUSH
   TABLES ... FOR EXPORT`](flush.md#flush-tables-for-export-with-list) can only be run on the
   table, not on individual table partitions.
4. Copy the `.ibd` and
   `.cfg` files for partition
   `p2` and partition `p3`
   from the source instance schema directory to the destination
   instance schema directory.

   ```terminal
   $> scp t1#p#p2.ibd t1#p#p2.cfg t1#p#p3.ibd t1#p#p3.cfg destination-server:/path/to/datadir/test
   ```

   The `.ibd` and `.cfg`
   files must be copied before releasing the shared locks, as
   described in the next step.

   Note

   If you are importing partitions from an encrypted
   tablespace, `InnoDB` generates a
   `.cfp` files in addition to a
   `.cfg` metadata files. The
   `.cfp` files must be copied to the
   destination instance together with the
   `.cfg` files. The
   `.cfp` files contain a transfer key and
   an encrypted tablespace key. On import,
   `InnoDB` uses the transfer key to decrypt
   the tablespace key. For related information, see
   [Section 17.13, “InnoDB Data-at-Rest Encryption”](innodb-data-encryption.md "17.13 InnoDB Data-at-Rest Encryption").
5. On the source instance, use
   [`UNLOCK
   TABLES`](lock-tables.md "15.3.6 LOCK TABLES and UNLOCK TABLES Statements") to release the locks acquired by
   [`FLUSH
   TABLES ... FOR EXPORT`](flush.md#flush-tables-for-export-with-list):

   ```sql
   mysql> USE test;
   mysql> UNLOCK TABLES;
   ```
6. On the destination instance, import table partitions
   `p2` and `p3`:

   ```sql
   mysql> USE test;
   mysql> ALTER TABLE t1 IMPORT PARTITION p2, p3 TABLESPACE;
   ```

   Note

   When [`ALTER
   TABLE ... IMPORT PARTITION ... TABLESPACE`](alter-table.md "15.1.9 ALTER TABLE Statement") is run
   on subpartitioned tables, both partition and subpartition
   table names are permitted. When a partition name is
   specified, subpartitions of that partition are included in
   the operation.

##### Limitations

- The *Transportable Tablespaces* feature
  is only supported for tables that reside in file-per-table
  tablespaces. It is not supported for the tables that reside
  in the system tablespace or general tablespaces. Tables in
  shared tablespaces cannot be quiesced.
- [`FLUSH
  TABLES ... FOR EXPORT`](flush.md#flush-tables-for-export-with-list) is not supported on tables
  with a `FULLTEXT` index, as full-text
  search auxiliary tables cannot be flushed. After importing a
  table with a `FULLTEXT` index, run
  [`OPTIMIZE TABLE`](optimize-table.md "15.7.3.4 OPTIMIZE TABLE Statement") to rebuild the
  `FULLTEXT` indexes. Alternatively, drop
  `FULLTEXT` indexes before the export
  operation and recreate the indexes after importing the table
  on the destination instance.
- Due to a `.cfg` metadata file limitation,
  schema mismatches are not reported for partition type or
  partition definition differences when importing a
  partitioned table. Column differences are reported.
- Prior to MySQL 8.0.19, index key part sort order information
  is not stored to the `.cfg` metadata file
  used during a tablespace import operation. The index key
  part sort order is therefore assumed to be ascending, which
  is the default. As a result, records could be sorted in an
  unintended order if one table involved in the import
  operation is defined with a DESC index key part sort order
  and the other table is not. The workaround is to drop and
  recreate affected indexes. For information about index key
  part sort order, see [Section 15.1.15, “CREATE INDEX Statement”](create-index.md "15.1.15 CREATE INDEX Statement").

  The `.cfg` file format was updated in MySQL
  8.0.19 to include index key part sort order information. The
  issue described above does not affect import operations
  between MySQL 8.0.19 server instances or higher.

##### Usage Notes

- With the exception of tables that contain instantly added or
  dropped columns,
  [`ALTER TABLE ...
  IMPORT TABLESPACE`](alter-table.md "15.1.9 ALTER TABLE Statement") does not require a
  `.cfg` metadata file to import a table.
  However, metadata checks are not performed when importing
  without a `.cfg` file, and a warning
  similar to the following is issued:

  ```none
  Message: InnoDB: IO Read error: (2, No such file or directory) Error opening '.\
  test\t.cfg', will attempt to import without schema verification
  1 row in set (0.00 sec)
  ```

  Importing a table without a `.cfg`
  metadata file should only be considered if no schema
  mismatches are expected and the table does not contain any
  instantly added or dropped columns. The ability to import
  without a `.cfg` file could be useful in
  crash recovery scenarios where metadata is not accessible.

  Attempting to import a table with columns that were added or
  dropped using `ALGORITHM=INSTANT` without
  using a `.cfg` file can result in
  undefined behavior.
- On Windows, `InnoDB` stores database,
  tablespace, and table names internally in lowercase. To
  avoid import problems on case-sensitive operating systems
  such as Linux and Unix, create all databases, tablespaces,
  and tables using lowercase names. A convenient way to ensure
  that names are created in lowercase is to set
  [`lower_case_table_names`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_lower_case_table_names) to 1
  before initializing the server. (It is prohibited to start
  the server with a
  [`lower_case_table_names`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_lower_case_table_names)
  setting that is different from the setting used when the
  server was initialized.)

  ```none
  [mysqld]
  lower_case_table_names=1
  ```
- When running
  [`ALTER TABLE ...
  DISCARD PARTITION ... TABLESPACE`](alter-table.md "15.1.9 ALTER TABLE Statement") and
  [`ALTER TABLE ...
  IMPORT PARTITION ... TABLESPACE`](alter-table.md "15.1.9 ALTER TABLE Statement") on subpartitioned
  tables, both partition and subpartition table names are
  permitted. When a partition name is specified, subpartitions
  of that partition are included in the operation.

##### Internals

The following information describes internals and messages
written to the error log during a table import procedure.

When [`ALTER TABLE
... DISCARD TABLESPACE`](alter-table.md "15.1.9 ALTER TABLE Statement") is run on the destination
instance:

- The table is locked in X mode.
- The tablespace is detached from the table.

When
[`FLUSH
TABLES ... FOR EXPORT`](flush.md#flush-tables-for-export-with-list) is run on the source instance:

- The table being flushed for export is locked in shared mode.
- The purge coordinator thread is stopped.
- Dirty pages are synchronized to disk.
- Table metadata is written to the binary
  `.cfg` file.

Expected error log messages for this operation:

```none
[Note] InnoDB: Sync to disk of '"test"."t1"' started.
[Note] InnoDB: Stopping purge
[Note] InnoDB: Writing table metadata to './test/t1.cfg'
[Note] InnoDB: Table '"test"."t1"' flushed to disk
```

When [`UNLOCK
TABLES`](lock-tables.md "15.3.6 LOCK TABLES and UNLOCK TABLES Statements") is run on the source instance:

- The binary `.cfg` file is deleted.
- The shared lock on the table or tables being imported is
  released and the purge coordinator thread is restarted.

Expected error log messages for this operation:

```none
[Note] InnoDB: Deleting the meta-data file './test/t1.cfg'
[Note] InnoDB: Resuming purge
```

When [`ALTER TABLE
... IMPORT TABLESPACE`](alter-table.md "15.1.9 ALTER TABLE Statement") is run on the destination
instance, the import algorithm performs the following operations
for each tablespace being imported:

- Each tablespace page is checked for corruption.
- The space ID and log sequence numbers (LSNs) on each page
  are updated.
- Flags are validated and LSN updated for the header page.
- Btree pages are updated.
- The page state is set to dirty so that it is written to
  disk.

Expected error log messages for this operation:

```none
[Note] InnoDB: Importing tablespace for table 'test/t1' that was exported
from host 'host_name'
[Note] InnoDB: Phase I - Update all pages
[Note] InnoDB: Sync to disk
[Note] InnoDB: Sync to disk - done!
[Note] InnoDB: Phase III - Flush changes to disk
[Note] InnoDB: Phase IV - Flush complete
```

Note

You may also receive a warning that a tablespace is discarded
(if you discarded the tablespace for the destination table)
and a message stating that statistics could not be calculated
due to a missing `.ibd` file:

```none
[Warning] InnoDB: Table "test"."t1" tablespace is set as discarded.
7f34d9a37700 InnoDB: cannot calculate statistics for table
"test"."t1" because the .ibd file is missing. For help, please refer to
http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/innodb-troubleshooting.html
```
