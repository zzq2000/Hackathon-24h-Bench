In addition to the built-in asynchronous replication, MySQL
8.0 supports an interface to semisynchronous
replication that is implemented by plugins. This section discusses
what semisynchronous replication is and how it works. The
following sections cover the administrative interface to
semisynchronous replication and how to install, configure, and
monitor it.

MySQL replication by default is asynchronous. The source writes
events to its binary log and replicas request them when they are
ready. The source does not know whether or when a replica has
retrieved and processed the transactions, and there is no
guarantee that any event ever reaches any replica. With
asynchronous replication, if the source crashes, transactions that
it has committed might not have been transmitted to any replica.
Failover from source to replica in this case might result in
failover to a server that is missing transactions relative to the
source.

With fully synchronous replication, when a source commits a
transaction, all replicas have also committed the transaction
before the source returns to the session that performed the
transaction. Fully synchronous replication means failover from the
source to any replica is possible at any time. The drawback of
fully synchronous replication is that there might be a lot of
delay to complete a transaction.

Semisynchronous replication falls between asynchronous and fully
synchronous replication. The source waits until at least one
replica has received and logged the events (the required number of
replicas is configurable), and then commits the transaction. The
source does not wait for all replicas to acknowledge receipt, and
it requires only an acknowledgement from the replicas, not that
the events have been fully executed and committed on the replica
side. Semisynchronous replication therefore guarantees that if the
source crashes, all the transactions that it has committed have
been transmitted to at least one replica.

Compared to asynchronous replication, semisynchronous replication
provides improved data integrity, because when a commit returns
successfully, it is known that the data exists in at least two
places. Until a semisynchronous source receives acknowledgment
from the required number of replicas, the transaction is on hold
and not committed.

Compared to fully synchronous replication, semisynchronous
replication is faster, because it can be configured to balance
your requirements for data integrity (the number of replicas
acknowledging receipt of the transaction) with the speed of
commits, which are slower due to the need to wait for replicas.

Important

With semisynchronous replication, if the source crashes and a
failover to a replica is carried out, the failed source should
not be reused as the replication source, and should be
discarded. It could have transactions that were not acknowledged
by any replica, which were therefore not committed before the
failover.

If your goal is to implement a fault-tolerant replication
topology where all the servers receive the same transactions in
the same order, and a server that crashes can rejoin the group
and be brought up to date automatically, you can use Group
Replication to achieve this. For information, see
[Chapter 20, *Group Replication*](group-replication.md "Chapter 20 Group Replication").

The performance impact of semisynchronous replication compared to
asynchronous replication is the tradeoff for increased data
integrity. The amount of slowdown is at least the TCP/IP roundtrip
time to send the commit to the replica and wait for the
acknowledgment of receipt by the replica. This means that
semisynchronous replication works best for close servers
communicating over fast networks, and worst for distant servers
communicating over slow networks. Semisynchronous replication also
places a rate limit on busy sessions by constraining the speed at
which binary log events can be sent from source to replica. When
one user is too busy, this slows it down, which can be useful in
some deployment situations.

Semisynchronous replication between a source and its replicas
operates as follows:

- A replica indicates whether it is semisynchronous-capable when
  it connects to the source.
- If semisynchronous replication is enabled on the source side
  and there is at least one semisynchronous replica, a thread
  that performs a transaction commit on the source blocks and
  waits until at least one semisynchronous replica acknowledges
  that it has received all events for the transaction, or until
  a timeout occurs.
- The replica acknowledges receipt of a transaction's events
  only after the events have been written to its relay log and
  flushed to disk.
- If a timeout occurs without any replica having acknowledged
  the transaction, the source reverts to asynchronous
  replication. When at least one semisynchronous replica catches
  up, the source returns to semisynchronous replication.
- Semisynchronous replication must be enabled on both the source
  and replica sides. If semisynchronous replication is disabled
  on the source, or enabled on the source but on no replicas,
  the source uses asynchronous replication.

While the source is blocking (waiting for acknowledgment from a
replica), it does not return to the session that performed the
transaction. When the block ends, the source returns to the
session, which then can proceed to execute other statements. At
this point, the transaction has committed on the source side, and
receipt of its events has been acknowledged by at least one
replica. The number of replica acknowledgments the source must
receive per transaction before returning to the session is
configurable, and defaults to one acknowledgement (see
[Section 19.4.10.2, “Configuring Semisynchronous Replication”](replication-semisync-interface.md "19.4.10.2 Configuring Semisynchronous Replication")).

Blocking also occurs after rollbacks that are written to the
binary log, which occurs when a transaction that modifies
nontransactional tables is rolled back. The rolled-back
transaction is logged even though it has no effect for
transactional tables because the modifications to the
nontransactional tables cannot be rolled back and must be sent to
replicas.

For statements that do not occur in transactional context (that
is, when no transaction has been started with
[`START
TRANSACTION`](commit.md "15.3.1 START TRANSACTION, COMMIT, and ROLLBACK Statements") or
[`SET autocommit =
0`](set-variable.md "15.7.6.1 SET Syntax for Variable Assignment")), autocommit is enabled and each statement commits
implicitly. With semisynchronous replication, the source blocks
for each such statement, just as it does for explicit transaction
commits.

By default, the source waits for replica acknowledgment of the
transaction receipt after syncing the binary log to disk, but
before committing the transaction to the storage engine. As an
alternative, you can configure the source so that the source waits
for replica acknowledgment after committing the transaction to the
storage engine, using the
[`rpl_semi_sync_source_wait_point`](replication-options-source.md#sysvar_rpl_semi_sync_source_wait_point)
or
[`rpl_semi_sync_master_wait_point`](replication-options-source.md#sysvar_rpl_semi_sync_master_wait_point)
system variable. This setting affects the replication
characteristics and the data that clients can see on the source.
For more information, see
[Section 19.4.10.2, “Configuring Semisynchronous Replication”](replication-semisync-interface.md "19.4.10.2 Configuring Semisynchronous Replication").

From MySQL 8.0.23, you can improve the performance of
semisynchronous replication by enabling the system variables
[`replication_sender_observe_commit_only`](replication-options-replica.md#sysvar_replication_sender_observe_commit_only),
which limits callbacks, and
[`replication_optimize_for_static_plugin_config`](replication-options-replica.md#sysvar_replication_optimize_for_static_plugin_config),
which adds shared locks and avoids unnecessary lock acquisitions.
These settings help as the number of replicas increases, because
contention for locks can slow down performance. Semisynchronous
replication source servers can also get performance benefits from
enabling these system variables, because they use the same locking
mechanisms as the replicas.
