### 7.9.2 Debugging a MySQL Client

To be able to debug a MySQL client with the integrated debug
package, you should configure MySQL with
[`-DWITH_DEBUG=1`](source-configuration-options.md#option_cmake_with_debug). See
[Section 2.8.7, “MySQL Source-Configuration Options”](source-configuration-options.md "2.8.7 MySQL Source-Configuration Options").

Before running a client, you should set the
`MYSQL_DEBUG` environment variable:

```terminal
$> MYSQL_DEBUG=d:t:O,/tmp/client.trace
$> export MYSQL_DEBUG
```

This causes clients to generate a trace file in
`/tmp/client.trace`.

If you have problems with your own client code, you should attempt
to connect to the server and run your query using a client that is
known to work. Do this by running [**mysql**](mysql.md "6.5.1 mysql — The MySQL Command-Line Client") in
debugging mode (assuming that you have compiled MySQL with
debugging on):

```terminal
$> mysql --debug=d:t:O,/tmp/client.trace
```

This provides useful information in case you mail a bug report.
See [Section 1.5, “How to Report Bugs or Problems”](bug-reports.md "1.5 How to Report Bugs or Problems").

If your client crashes at some 'legal' looking code, you should
check that your `mysql.h` include file matches
your MySQL library file. A very common mistake is to use an old
`mysql.h` file from an old MySQL installation
with new MySQL library.
