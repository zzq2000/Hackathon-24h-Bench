MySQL Installer is a standalone application designed to ease the complexity of
installing and configuring MySQL products that run on Microsoft
Windows. It is downloaded with and supports the following MySQL
products:

- MySQL Servers

  MySQL Installer can install and manage multiple, separate MySQL server
  instances on the same host at the same time. For example, MySQL Installer
  can install, configure, and upgrade separate instances of MySQL
  5.7 and MySQL 8.0 on the same host. MySQL Installer does not permit server
  upgrades between major and minor version numbers, but does
  permit upgrades within a release series (such as 8.0.36 to
  8.0.37).

  Note

  MySQL Installer cannot install both *Community* and
  *Commercial* releases of MySQL server on
  the same host. If you require both releases on the same host,
  consider using the
  [ZIP
  archive](windows-choosing-package.md#windows-choosing-package-no-zip "MySQL noinstall ZIP Archives") distribution to install one of the releases.
- MySQL Applications

  MySQL Workbench, MySQL Shell, and MySQL Router.
- MySQL Connectors

  These are not supported, instead install from
  <https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/>. These connectors include
  MySQL Connector/NET, MySQL Connector/Python, MySQL Connector/ODBC, MySQL Connector/J, MySQL Connector/Node.js, and MySQL Connector/C++.

  Note

  The connectors were bundled before MySQL Installer 1.6.7 (MySQL Server
  8.0.34), and MySQL Installer could install each connector up to version
  8.0.33 until MySQL Installer 1.6.11 (MySQL Server 8.0.37). MySQL Installer now only
  detects these old connector versions to uninstall them.

#### Installation Requirements

MySQL Installer requires Microsoft .NET Framework 4.5.2 or later. If this
version is not installed on the host computer, you can download it
by visiting the
[Microsoft
website](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=42643).

To invoke MySQL Installer after a successful installation:

1. Right-click Windows Start, select
   Run, and then click
   Browse. Navigate to `Program
   Files (x86) > MySQL > MySQL Installer for Windows` to
   open the program folder.
2. Select one of the following files:

   - `MySQLInstaller.exe` to open the
     graphical application.
   - `MySQLInstallerConsole.exe` to open the
     command-line application.
3. Click Open and then click
   OK in the Run window. If you are prompted
   to allow the application to make changes to the device, select
   `Yes`.

Each time you invoke MySQL Installer, the initialization process looks for the
presence of an internet connection and prompts you to enable offline
mode if it finds no internet access (and offline mode is disabled).
Select `Yes` to run MySQL Installer without
internet-connection capabilities. MySQL product availability is
limited to only those products currently in the product cache when
you enable offline mode. To download MySQL products, click the
offline mode Disable quick action shown on
the dashboard.

An internet connection is required to download a manifest containing
metadata for the latest MySQL products that are not part of a full
bundle. MySQL Installer attempts to download the manifest when you start the
application for the first time and then periodically in configurable
intervals (see [MySQL Installer
options](mysql-installer-catalog-dashboard.md#mysql-installer-options-icon)). Alternatively, you can retrieve an updated manifest
manually by clicking Catalog in the
[MySQL Installer dashboard](mysql-installer-catalog-dashboard.md#windows-product-dashboard "MySQL Installer Dashboard").

Note

If the first-time or subsequent manifest download is unsuccessful,
an error is logged and you may have limited access to MySQL
products during your session. MySQL Installer attempts to download the
manifest with each startup until the initial manifest structure is
updated. For help finding a product, see
[Locating Products to Install](mysql-installer-catalog-dashboard.md#locate-products "Locating Products to Install").

#### MySQL Installer Community Release

Download software from <https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/installer/>
to install the Community release of all MySQL products for Windows.
Select one of the following MySQL Installer package options:

- *Web*: Contains MySQL Installer and configuration files
  only. The web package option downloads only the MySQL products
  you select to install, but it requires an internet connection
  for each download. The size of this file is approximately 2 MB.
  The file name has the form
  `mysql-installer-community-web-VERSION.N.msi`
  in which *`VERSION`* is the MySQL server
  version number such as 8.0 and
  `N` is the package number, which begins at 0.
- *Full or Current Bundle*: Bundles all of the
  MySQL products for Windows (including the MySQL server). The
  file size is over 300 MB, and the name has the form
  `mysql-installer-community-VERSION.N.msi`
  in which *`VERSION`* is the MySQL Server
  version number such as 8.0 and
  `N` is the package number, which begins at 0.

#### MySQL Installer Commercial Release

Download software from <https://edelivery.oracle.com/>
to install the Commercial release (Standard or Enterprise Edition)
of MySQL products for Windows. If you are logged in to your My
Oracle Support (MOS) account, the Commercial release includes all of
the current and previous GA versions available in the Community
release, but it excludes development-milestone versions. When you
are not logged in, you see only the list of bundled products that
you downloaded already.

The Commercial release also includes the following products:

- Workbench SE/EE
- MySQL Enterprise Backup
- MySQL Enterprise Firewall

The Commercial release integrates with your MOS account. For
knowledge-base content and patches, see
[My Oracle Support](https://support.oracle.com/).
