#### 15.7.7.15 SHOW ENGINE Statement

```sql
SHOW ENGINE engine_name {STATUS | MUTEX}
```

[`SHOW ENGINE`](show-engine.md "15.7.7.15 SHOW ENGINE Statement") displays operational
information about a storage engine. It requires the
[`PROCESS`](privileges-provided.md#priv_process) privilege. The statement
has these variants:

```sql
SHOW ENGINE INNODB STATUS
SHOW ENGINE INNODB MUTEX
SHOW ENGINE PERFORMANCE_SCHEMA STATUS
```

[`SHOW ENGINE INNODB
STATUS`](show-engine.md "15.7.7.15 SHOW ENGINE Statement") displays extensive information from the
standard `InnoDB` Monitor about the state of
the `InnoDB` storage engine. For information
about the standard monitor and other `InnoDB`
Monitors that provide information about
`InnoDB` processing, see
[Section 17.17, “InnoDB Monitors”](innodb-monitors.md "17.17 InnoDB Monitors").

[`SHOW ENGINE INNODB
MUTEX`](show-engine.md "15.7.7.15 SHOW ENGINE Statement") displays `InnoDB`
[mutex](glossary.md#glos_mutex "mutex") and
[rw-lock](glossary.md#glos_rw_lock "rw-lock") statistics.

Note

`InnoDB` mutexes and rwlocks can also be
monitored using [Performance
Schema](performance-schema.md "Chapter 29 MySQL Performance Schema") tables. See
[Section 17.16.2, “Monitoring InnoDB Mutex Waits Using Performance Schema”](monitor-innodb-mutex-waits-performance-schema.md "17.16.2 Monitoring InnoDB Mutex Waits Using Performance Schema").

Mutex statistics collection is configured dynamically using the
following options:

- To enable the collection of mutex statistics, run:

  ```sql
  SET GLOBAL innodb_monitor_enable='latch';
  ```
- To reset mutex statistics, run:

  ```sql
  SET GLOBAL innodb_monitor_reset='latch';
  ```
- To disable the collection of mutex statistics, run:

  ```sql
  SET GLOBAL innodb_monitor_disable='latch';
  ```

Collection of mutex statistics for
[`SHOW ENGINE INNODB
MUTEX`](show-engine.md "15.7.7.15 SHOW ENGINE Statement") can also be enabled by setting
[`innodb_monitor_enable='all'`](innodb-parameters.md#sysvar_innodb_monitor_enable), or
disabled by setting
[`innodb_monitor_disable='all'`](innodb-parameters.md#sysvar_innodb_monitor_disable).

[`SHOW ENGINE INNODB
MUTEX`](show-engine.md "15.7.7.15 SHOW ENGINE Statement") output has these columns:

- `Type`

  Always `InnoDB`.
- `Name`

  For mutexes, the `Name` field reports only
  the mutex name. For rwlocks, the `Name`
  field reports the source file where the rwlock is
  implemented, and the line number in the file where the
  rwlock is created. The line number is specific to your
  version of MySQL.
- `Status`

  The mutex status. This field reports the number of spins,
  waits, and calls. Statistics for low-level operating system
  mutexes, which are implemented outside of
  `InnoDB`, are not reported.

  - `spins` indicates the number of spins.
  - `waits` indicates the number of mutex
    waits.
  - `calls` indicates how many times the
    mutex was requested.

`SHOW ENGINE INNODB MUTEX` does not list
mutexes and rw-locks for each buffer pool block, as the amount
of output would be overwhelming on systems with a large buffer
pool. `SHOW ENGINE INNODB MUTEX` does, however,
print aggregate `BUF_BLOCK_MUTEX` spin, wait,
and call values for buffer pool block mutexes and rw-locks.
`SHOW ENGINE INNODB MUTEX` also does not list
any mutexes or rw-locks that have never been waited on
(`os_waits=0`). Thus, `SHOW ENGINE
INNODB MUTEX` only displays information about mutexes
and rw-locks outside of the buffer pool that have caused at
least one OS-level [wait](glossary.md#glos_wait "wait").

Use [`SHOW ENGINE
PERFORMANCE_SCHEMA STATUS`](show-engine.md "15.7.7.15 SHOW ENGINE Statement") to inspect the internal
operation of the Performance Schema code:

```sql
mysql> SHOW ENGINE PERFORMANCE_SCHEMA STATUS\G
...
*************************** 3. row ***************************
  Type: performance_schema
  Name: events_waits_history.size
Status: 76
*************************** 4. row ***************************
  Type: performance_schema
  Name: events_waits_history.count
Status: 10000
*************************** 5. row ***************************
  Type: performance_schema
  Name: events_waits_history.memory
Status: 760000
...
*************************** 57. row ***************************
  Type: performance_schema
  Name: performance_schema.memory
Status: 26459600
...
```

This statement is intended to help the DBA understand the
effects that different Performance Schema options have on memory
requirements.

`Name` values consist of two parts, which name
an internal buffer and a buffer attribute, respectively.
Interpret buffer names as follows:

- An internal buffer that is not exposed as a table is named
  within parentheses. Examples:
  `(pfs_cond_class).size`,
  `(pfs_mutex_class).memory`.
- An internal buffer that is exposed as a table in the
  `performance_schema` database is named
  after the table, without parentheses. Examples:
  `events_waits_history.size`,
  `mutex_instances.count`.
- A value that applies to the Performance Schema as a whole
  begins with `performance_schema`. Example:
  `performance_schema.memory`.

Buffer attributes have these meanings:

- `size` is the size of the internal record
  used by the implementation, such as the size of a row in a
  table. `size` values cannot be changed.
- `count` is the number of internal records,
  such as the number of rows in a table.
  `count` values can be changed using
  Performance Schema configuration options.
- For a table,
  `tbl_name.memory`
  is the product of `size` and
  `count`. For the Performance Schema as a
  whole, `performance_schema.memory` is the
  sum of all the memory used (the sum of all other
  `memory` values).

In some cases, there is a direct relationship between a
Performance Schema configuration parameter and a `SHOW
ENGINE` value. For example,
`events_waits_history_long.count` corresponds
to
[`performance_schema_events_waits_history_long_size`](performance-schema-system-variables.md#sysvar_performance_schema_events_waits_history_long_size).
In other cases, the relationship is more complex. For example,
`events_waits_history.count` corresponds to
[`performance_schema_events_waits_history_size`](performance-schema-system-variables.md#sysvar_performance_schema_events_waits_history_size)
(the number of rows per thread) multiplied by
[`performance_schema_max_thread_instances`](performance-schema-system-variables.md#sysvar_performance_schema_max_thread_instances)
( the number of threads).

**SHOW ENGINE NDB STATUS.**
If the server has the [`NDB`](mysql-cluster.md "Chapter 25 MySQL NDB Cluster 8.0") storage
engine enabled, `SHOW ENGINE NDB STATUS`
displays cluster status information such as the number of
connected data nodes, the cluster connectstring, and cluster
binary log epochs, as well as counts of various Cluster API
objects created by the MySQL Server when connected to the
cluster. Sample output from this statement is shown here:

```sql
mysql> SHOW ENGINE NDB STATUS;

```

The `Status` column in each of these rows
provides information about the MySQL server's connection to
the cluster and about the cluster binary log's status,
respectively. The `Status` information is in
the form of comma-delimited set of name/value pairs.

The `connection` row's
`Status` column contains the name/value pairs
described in the following table.

| Name | Value |
| --- | --- |
| `cluster_node_id` | The node ID of the MySQL server in the cluster |
| `connected_host` | The host name or IP address of the cluster management server to which the MySQL server is connected |
| `connected_port` | The port used by the MySQL server to connect to the management server (`connected_host`) |
| `number_of_data_nodes` | The number of data nodes configured for the cluster (that is, the number of `[ndbd]` sections in the cluster `config.ini` file) |
| `number_of_ready_data_nodes` | The number of data nodes in the cluster that are actually running |
| `connect_count` | The number of times this [**mysqld**](mysqld.md "6.3.1 mysqld — The MySQL Server") has connected or reconnected to cluster data nodes |

The `binlog` row's
`Status` column contains information relating
to NDB Cluster Replication. The name/value pairs it contains are
described in the following table.

| Name | Value |
| --- | --- |
| `latest_epoch` | The most recent epoch most recently run on this MySQL server (that is, the sequence number of the most recent transaction run on the server) |
| `latest_trans_epoch` | The most recent epoch processed by the cluster's data nodes |
| `latest_received_binlog_epoch` | The most recent epoch received by the binary log thread |
| `latest_handled_binlog_epoch` | The most recent epoch processed by the binary log thread (for writing to the binary log) |
| `latest_applied_binlog_epoch` | The most recent epoch actually written to the binary log |

See [Section 25.7, “NDB Cluster Replication”](mysql-cluster-replication.md "25.7 NDB Cluster Replication"), for more
information.

The remaining rows from the output of `SHOW ENGINE NDB
STATUS` which are most likely to prove useful in
monitoring the cluster are listed here by
`Name`:

- `NdbTransaction`: The number and size of
  `NdbTransaction` objects that have been
  created. An `NdbTransaction` is created
  each time a table schema operation (such as
  [`CREATE TABLE`](create-table.md "15.1.20 CREATE TABLE Statement") or
  [`ALTER TABLE`](alter-table.md "15.1.9 ALTER TABLE Statement")) is performed on
  an [`NDB`](mysql-cluster.md "Chapter 25 MySQL NDB Cluster 8.0") table.
- `NdbOperation`: The number and size of
  `NdbOperation` objects that have been
  created.
- `NdbIndexScanOperation`: The number and
  size of `NdbIndexScanOperation` objects
  that have been created.
- `NdbIndexOperation`: The number and size of
  `NdbIndexOperation` objects that have been
  created.
- `NdbRecAttr`: The number and size of
  `NdbRecAttr` objects that have been
  created. In general, one of these is created each time a
  data manipulation statement is performed by an SQL node.
- `NdbBlob`: The number and size of
  `NdbBlob` objects that have been created.
  An `NdbBlob` is created for each new
  operation involving a [`BLOB`](blob.md "13.3.4 The BLOB and TEXT Types")
  column in an [`NDB`](mysql-cluster.md "Chapter 25 MySQL NDB Cluster 8.0") table.
- `NdbReceiver`: The number and size of any
  `NdbReceiver` object that have been
  created. The number in the `created` column
  is the same as the number of data nodes in the cluster to
  which the MySQL server has connected.

Note

`SHOW ENGINE NDB STATUS` returns an empty
result if no operations involving
[`NDB`](mysql-cluster.md "Chapter 25 MySQL NDB Cluster 8.0") tables have been performed
during the current session by the MySQL client accessing the
SQL node on which this statement is run.
