### 29.4.4 Pre-Filtering by Instrument

The [`setup_instruments`](performance-schema-setup-instruments-table.md "29.12.2.3 The setup_instruments Table") table lists
the available instruments:

```sql

       FROM performance_schema.setup_instruments;

To control whether an instrument is enabled, set its
`ENABLED` column to `YES` or
`NO`. To configure whether to collect timing
information for an enabled instrument, set its
`TIMED` value to `YES` or
`NO`. Setting the `TIMED`
column affects Performance Schema table contents as described in
[Section 29.4.1, “Performance Schema Event Timing”](performance-schema-timing.md "29.4.1 Performance Schema Event Timing").

Modifications to most
[`setup_instruments`](performance-schema-setup-instruments-table.md "29.12.2.3 The setup_instruments Table") rows affect
monitoring immediately. For some instruments, modifications are
effective only at server startup; changing them at runtime has
no effect. This affects primarily mutexes, conditions, and
rwlocks in the server, although there may be other instruments
for which this is true.

The [`setup_instruments`](performance-schema-setup-instruments-table.md "29.12.2.3 The setup_instruments Table") table
provides the most basic form of control over event production.
To further refine event production based on the type of object
or thread being monitored, other tables may be used as described
in [Section 29.4.3, “Event Pre-Filtering”](performance-schema-pre-filtering.md "29.4.3 Event Pre-Filtering").

The following examples demonstrate possible operations on the
[`setup_instruments`](performance-schema-setup-instruments-table.md "29.12.2.3 The setup_instruments Table") table. These
changes, like other pre-filtering operations, affect all users.
Some of these queries use the [`LIKE`](string-comparison-functions.md#operator_like)
operator and a pattern match instrument names. For additional
information about specifying patterns to select instruments, see
[Section 29.4.9, “Naming Instruments or Consumers for Filtering Operations”](performance-schema-filtering-names.md "29.4.9 Naming Instruments or Consumers for Filtering Operations").

- Disable all instruments:

  ```sql
  UPDATE performance_schema.setup_instruments
  SET ENABLED = 'NO';
  ```

  Now no events are collected.
- Disable all file instruments, adding them to the current set
  of disabled instruments:

  ```sql
  UPDATE performance_schema.setup_instruments
  SET ENABLED = 'NO'
  WHERE NAME LIKE 'wait/io/file/%';
  ```
- Disable only file instruments, enable all other instruments:

  ```sql
  UPDATE performance_schema.setup_instruments
  SET ENABLED = IF(NAME LIKE 'wait/io/file/%', 'NO', 'YES');
  ```
- Enable all but those instruments in the
  `mysys` library:

  ```sql
  UPDATE performance_schema.setup_instruments
  SET ENABLED = CASE WHEN NAME LIKE '%/mysys/%' THEN 'YES' ELSE 'NO' END;
  ```
- Disable a specific instrument:

  ```sql
  UPDATE performance_schema.setup_instruments
  SET ENABLED = 'NO'
  WHERE NAME = 'wait/synch/mutex/mysys/TMPDIR_mutex';
  ```
- To toggle the state of an instrument, “flip”
  its `ENABLED` value:

  ```sql
  UPDATE performance_schema.setup_instruments
  SET ENABLED = IF(ENABLED = 'YES', 'NO', 'YES')
  WHERE NAME = 'wait/synch/mutex/mysys/TMPDIR_mutex';
  ```
- Disable timing for all events:

  ```sql
  UPDATE performance_schema.setup_instruments
  SET TIMED = 'NO';
  ```
