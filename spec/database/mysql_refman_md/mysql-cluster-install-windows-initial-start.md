#### 25.3.2.3 Initial Startup of NDB Cluster on Windows

Once the NDB Cluster executables and needed configuration files
are in place, performing an initial start of the cluster is
simply a matter of starting the NDB Cluster executables for all
nodes in the cluster. Each cluster node process must be started
separately, and on the host computer where it resides. The
management node should be started first, followed by the data
nodes, and then finally by any SQL nodes.

1. On the management node host, issue the following command
   from the command line to start the management node process.
   The output should appear similar to what is shown here:

   ```terminal
   C:\mysql\bin> ndb_mgmd
   2010-06-23 07:53:34 [MgmtSrvr] INFO -- NDB Cluster Management Server. mysql-8.0.44-ndb-8.0.44
   2010-06-23 07:53:34 [MgmtSrvr] INFO -- Reading cluster configuration from 'config.ini'
   ```

   The management node process continues to print logging
   output to the console. This is normal, because the
   management node is not running as a Windows service. (If you
   have used NDB Cluster on a Unix-like platform such as Linux,
   you may notice that the management node's default
   behavior in this regard on Windows is effectively the
   opposite of its behavior on Unix systems, where it runs by
   default as a Unix daemon process. This behavior is also true
   of NDB Cluster data node processes running on Windows.) For
   this reason, do not close the window in which
   [**ndb\_mgmd.exe**](mysql-cluster-programs-ndb-mgmd.md "25.5.4 ndb_mgmd — The NDB Cluster Management Server Daemon") is running; doing so kills
   the management node process. (See
   [Section 25.3.2.4, “Installing NDB Cluster Processes as Windows Services”](mysql-cluster-install-windows-service.md "25.3.2.4 Installing NDB Cluster Processes as Windows Services"),
   where we show how to install and run NDB Cluster processes
   as Windows services.)

   The required `-f` option tells the management
   node where to find the global configuration file
   (`config.ini`). The long form of this
   option is [`--config-file`](mysql-cluster-programs-ndb-mgmd.md#option_ndb_mgmd_config-file).

   Important

   An NDB Cluster management node caches the configuration
   data that it reads from `config.ini`;
   once it has created a configuration cache, it ignores the
   `config.ini` file on subsequent starts
   unless forced to do otherwise. This means that, if the
   management node fails to start due to an error in this
   file, you must make the management node re-read
   `config.ini` after you have corrected
   any errors in it. You can do this by starting
   [**ndb\_mgmd.exe**](mysql-cluster-programs-ndb-mgmd.md "25.5.4 ndb_mgmd — The NDB Cluster Management Server Daemon") with the
   [`--reload`](mysql-cluster-programs-ndb-mgmd.md#option_ndb_mgmd_reload) or
   [`--initial`](mysql-cluster-programs-ndb-mgmd.md#option_ndb_mgmd_initial) option on the
   command line. Either of these options works to refresh the
   configuration cache.

   It is not necessary or advisable to use either of these
   options in the management node's
   `my.ini` file.
2. On each of the data node hosts, run the command shown here
   to start the data node processes:

   ```terminal
   C:\mysql\bin> ndbd
   2010-06-23 07:53:46 [ndbd] INFO -- Configuration fetched from 'localhost:1186', generation: 1
   ```

   In each case, the first line of output from the data node
   process should resemble what is shown in the preceding
   example, and is followed by additional lines of logging
   output. As with the management node process, this is normal,
   because the data node is not running as a Windows service.
   For this reason, do not close the console window in which
   the data node process is running; doing so kills
   [**ndbd.exe**](mysql-cluster-programs-ndbd.md "25.5.1 ndbd — The NDB Cluster Data Node Daemon"). (For more information, see
   [Section 25.3.2.4, “Installing NDB Cluster Processes as Windows Services”](mysql-cluster-install-windows-service.md "25.3.2.4 Installing NDB Cluster Processes as Windows Services").)
3. Do not start the SQL node yet; it cannot connect to the
   cluster until the data nodes have finished starting, which
   may take some time. Instead, in a new console window on the
   management node host, start the NDB Cluster management
   client [**ndb\_mgm.exe**](mysql-cluster-programs-ndb-mgm.md "25.5.5 ndb_mgm — The NDB Cluster Management Client"), which should be in
   `C:\mysql\bin` on the management node
   host. (Do not try to re-use the console window where
   [**ndb\_mgmd.exe**](mysql-cluster-programs-ndb-mgmd.md "25.5.4 ndb_mgmd — The NDB Cluster Management Server Daemon") is running by typing
   **CTRL**+**C**, as this kills the
   management node.) The resulting output should look like
   this:

   ```terminal
   C:\mysql\bin> ndb_mgm
   -- NDB Cluster -- Management Client --
   ndb_mgm>
   ```

   When the prompt `ndb_mgm>` appears, this
   indicates that the management client is ready to receive NDB
   Cluster management commands. You can observe the status of
   the data nodes as they start by entering
   [`ALL STATUS`](mysql-cluster-mgm-client-commands.md#ndbclient-status) at the
   management client prompt. This command causes a running
   report of the data nodes's startup sequence, which
   should look something like this:

   ```ndbmgm
   ndb_mgm> ALL STATUS
   Connected to Management Server at: localhost:1186
   Node 2: starting (Last completed phase 3) (mysql-8.0.44-ndb-8.0.44)
   Node 3: starting (Last completed phase 3) (mysql-8.0.44-ndb-8.0.44)

   Node 2: starting (Last completed phase 4) (mysql-8.0.44-ndb-8.0.44)
   Node 3: starting (Last completed phase 4) (mysql-8.0.44-ndb-8.0.44)

   Node 2: Started (version 8.0.44)
   Node 3: Started (version 8.0.44)

   ndb_mgm>
   ```

   Note

   Commands issued in the management client are not
   case-sensitive; we use uppercase as the canonical form of
   these commands, but you are not required to observe this
   convention when inputting them into the
   [**ndb\_mgm**](mysql-cluster-programs-ndb-mgm.md "25.5.5 ndb_mgm — The NDB Cluster Management Client") client. For more information,
   see [Section 25.6.1, “Commands in the NDB Cluster Management Client”](mysql-cluster-mgm-client-commands.md "25.6.1 Commands in the NDB Cluster Management Client").

   The output produced by [`ALL
   STATUS`](mysql-cluster-mgm-client-commands.md#ndbclient-status) is likely to vary from what is shown here,
   according to the speed at which the data nodes are able to
   start, the release version number of the NDB Cluster
   software you are using, and other factors. What is
   significant is that, when you see that both data nodes have
   started, you are ready to start the SQL node.

   You can leave [**ndb\_mgm.exe**](mysql-cluster-programs-ndb-mgm.md "25.5.5 ndb_mgm — The NDB Cluster Management Client") running; it has
   no negative impact on the performance of the NDB Cluster,
   and we use it in the next step to verify that the SQL node
   is connected to the cluster after you have started it.
4. On the computer designated as the SQL node host, open a
   console window and navigate to the directory where you
   unpacked the NDB Cluster binaries (if you are following our
   example, this is `C:\mysql\bin`).

   Start the SQL node by invoking [**mysqld.exe**](mysqld.md "6.3.1 mysqld — The MySQL Server")
   from the command line, as shown here:

   ```terminal
   C:\mysql\bin> mysqld --console
   ```

   The [`--console`](server-options.md#option_mysqld_console) option causes
   logging information to be written to the console, which can
   be helpful in the event of problems. (Once you are satisfied
   that the SQL node is running in a satisfactory manner, you
   can stop it and restart it out without the
   [`--console`](server-options.md#option_mysqld_console) option, so that
   logging is performed normally.)

   In the console window where the management client
   ([**ndb\_mgm.exe**](mysql-cluster-programs-ndb-mgm.md "25.5.5 ndb_mgm — The NDB Cluster Management Client")) is running on the
   management node host, enter the
   [`SHOW`](mysql-cluster-mgm-client-commands.md#ndbclient-show) command, which
   should produce output similar to what is shown here:

   ```ndbmgm
   ndb_mgm> SHOW
   Connected to Management Server at: localhost:1186
   Cluster Configuration
   ---------------------
   [ndbd(NDB)]     2 node(s)
   id=2    @198.51.100.30  (Version: 8.0.44-ndb-8.0.44, Nodegroup: 0, *)
   id=3    @198.51.100.40  (Version: 8.0.44-ndb-8.0.44, Nodegroup: 0)

   [ndb_mgmd(MGM)] 1 node(s)
   id=1    @198.51.100.10  (Version: 8.0.44-ndb-8.0.44)

   [mysqld(API)]   1 node(s)
   id=4    @198.51.100.20  (Version: 8.0.44-ndb-8.0.44)
   ```

   You can also verify that the SQL node is connected to the
   NDB Cluster in the [**mysql**](mysql.md "6.5.1 mysql — The MySQL Command-Line Client") client
   ([**mysql.exe**](mysql.md "6.5.1 mysql — The MySQL Command-Line Client")) using the
   [`SHOW ENGINE NDB STATUS`](show-engine.md#show-engine-ndb-status "SHOW ENGINE NDB STATUS")
   statement.

You should now be ready to work with database objects and data
using NDB Cluster 's
[`NDBCLUSTER`](mysql-cluster.md "Chapter 25 MySQL NDB Cluster 8.0") storage engine. See
[Section 25.3.5, “NDB Cluster Example with Tables and Data”](mysql-cluster-install-example-data.md "25.3.5 NDB Cluster Example with Tables and Data"), for more
information and examples.

You can also install [**ndb\_mgmd.exe**](mysql-cluster-programs-ndb-mgmd.md "25.5.4 ndb_mgmd — The NDB Cluster Management Server Daemon"),
[**ndbd.exe**](mysql-cluster-programs-ndbd.md "25.5.1 ndbd — The NDB Cluster Data Node Daemon"), and [**ndbmtd.exe**](mysql-cluster-programs-ndbmtd.md "25.5.3 ndbmtd — The NDB Cluster Data Node Daemon (Multi-Threaded)")
as Windows services. For information on how to do this, see
[Section 25.3.2.4, “Installing NDB Cluster Processes as Windows Services”](mysql-cluster-install-windows-service.md "25.3.2.4 Installing NDB Cluster Processes as Windows Services")).
