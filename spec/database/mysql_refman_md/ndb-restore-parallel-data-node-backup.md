#### 25.5.23.3 Restoring from a backup taken in parallel

NDB Cluster 8.0 supports parallel backups on each data node
using [**ndbmtd**](mysql-cluster-programs-ndbmtd.md "25.5.3 ndbmtd — The NDB Cluster Data Node Daemon (Multi-Threaded)") with multiple LDMs (see
[Section 25.6.8.5, “Taking an NDB Backup with Parallel Data Nodes”](mysql-cluster-backup-parallel-data-nodes.md "25.6.8.5 Taking an NDB Backup with Parallel Data Nodes")).
The next two sections describe how to restore backups that
were taken in this fashion.

##### 25.5.23.3.1 Restoring a parallel backup in parallel

Restoring a parallel backup in parallel requires an
[**ndb\_restore**](mysql-cluster-programs-ndb-restore.md "25.5.23 ndb_restore — Restore an NDB Cluster Backup") binary from an NDB 8.0
distribution. The process is not substantially different
from that outlined in the general usage section under the
description of the [**ndb\_restore**](mysql-cluster-programs-ndb-restore.md "25.5.23 ndb_restore — Restore an NDB Cluster Backup") program,
and consists of executing [**ndb\_restore**](mysql-cluster-programs-ndb-restore.md "25.5.23 ndb_restore — Restore an NDB Cluster Backup")
twice, similarly to what is shown here:

```simple
$> ndb_restore -n 1 -b 1 -m --backup-path=path/to/backup_dir/BACKUP/BACKUP-backup_id
$> ndb_restore -n 1 -b 1 -r --backup-path=path/to/backup_dir/BACKUP/BACKUP-backup_id
```

*`backup_id`* is the ID of the backup
to be restored. In the general case, no additional special
arguments are required; [**ndb\_restore**](mysql-cluster-programs-ndb-restore.md "25.5.23 ndb_restore — Restore an NDB Cluster Backup")
always checks for the existence of parallel subdirectories
under the directory indicated by the
[`--backup-path`](mysql-cluster-programs-ndb-restore.md#option_ndb_restore_backup-path) option and
restores the metadata (serially) and then the table data (in
parallel).

##### 25.5.23.3.2 Restoring a parallel backup serially

It is possible to restore a backup that was made using
parallelism on the data nodes in serial fashion. To do this,
invoke [**ndb\_restore**](mysql-cluster-programs-ndb-restore.md "25.5.23 ndb_restore — Restore an NDB Cluster Backup") with
[`--backup-path`](mysql-cluster-programs-ndb-restore.md#option_ndb_restore_backup-path) pointing
to the subdirectories created by each LDM under the main
backup directory, once to any one of the subdirectories to
restore the metadata (it does not matter which one, since
each subdirectory contains a complete copy of the metadata),
then to each of the subdirectories in turn to restore the
data. Suppose that we want to restore the backup having
backup ID 100 that was taken with four LDMs, and that the
[`BackupDataDir`](mysql-cluster-ndbd-definition.md#ndbparam-ndbd-backupdatadir) is
`/opt`. To restore the metadata in this
case, we can invoke [**ndb\_restore**](mysql-cluster-programs-ndb-restore.md "25.5.23 ndb_restore — Restore an NDB Cluster Backup") like
this:

```simple
$> ndb_restore -n 1 -b 1 -m --backup-path=opt/BACKUP/BACKUP-100/BACKUP-100-PART-1-OF-4
```

To restore the table data, execute
[**ndb\_restore**](mysql-cluster-programs-ndb-restore.md "25.5.23 ndb_restore — Restore an NDB Cluster Backup") four times, each time using
one of the subdirectories in turn, as shown here:

```simple
$> ndb_restore -n 1 -b 1 -r --backup-path=opt/BACKUP/BACKUP-100/BACKUP-100-PART-1-OF-4
$> ndb_restore -n 1 -b 1 -r --backup-path=opt/BACKUP/BACKUP-100/BACKUP-100-PART-2-OF-4
$> ndb_restore -n 1 -b 1 -r --backup-path=opt/BACKUP/BACKUP-100/BACKUP-100-PART-3-OF-4
$> ndb_restore -n 1 -b 1 -r --backup-path=opt/BACKUP/BACKUP-100/BACKUP-100-PART-4-OF-4
```

You can employ the same technique to restore a parallel
backup to an older version of NDB Cluster (7.6 or earlier)
that does not support parallel backups, using the
[**ndb\_restore**](mysql-cluster-programs-ndb-restore.md "25.5.23 ndb_restore — Restore an NDB Cluster Backup") binary supplied with the
older version of the NDB Cluster software.
