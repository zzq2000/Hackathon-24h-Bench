### 25.7.7 Using Two Replication Channels for NDB Cluster Replication

In a more complete example scenario, we envision two replication
channels to provide redundancy and thereby guard against possible
failure of a single replication channel. This requires a total of
four replication servers, two source servers on the source cluster
and two replica servers on the replica cluster. For purposes of
the discussion that follows, we assume that unique identifiers are
assigned as shown here:

**Table 25.73 NDB Cluster replication servers described in the text**

| Server ID | Description |
| --- | --- |
| 1 | Source - primary replication channel (*S*) |
| 2 | Source - secondary replication channel (*S'*) |
| 3 | Replica - primary replication channel (*R*) |
| 4 | replica - secondary replication channel (*R'*) |

Setting up replication with two channels is not radically
different from setting up a single replication channel. First, the
[**mysqld**](mysqld.md "6.3.1 mysqld — The MySQL Server") processes for the primary and secondary
replication source servers must be started, followed by those for
the primary and secondary replicas. The replication processes can
be initiated by issuing the [`START
REPLICA`](start-replica.md "15.4.2.6 START REPLICA Statement") statement on each of the replicas. The commands
and the order in which they need to be issued are shown here:

1. Start the primary replication source:

   ```terminal
   shellS> mysqld --ndbcluster --server-id=1 \
                  --log-bin &
   ```
2. Start the secondary replication source:

   ```terminal
   shellS'> mysqld --ndbcluster --server-id=2 \
                  --log-bin &
   ```
3. Start the primary replica server:

   ```terminal
   shellR> mysqld --ndbcluster --server-id=3 \
                  --skip-slave-start &
   ```
4. Start the secondary replica server:

   ```terminal
   shellR'> mysqld --ndbcluster --server-id=4 \
                   --skip-slave-start &
   ```
5. Finally, initiate replication on the primary channel by
   executing the [`START REPLICA`](start-replica.md "15.4.2.6 START REPLICA Statement")
   statement on the primary replica as shown here:

   ```sql
   mysqlR> START SLAVE;
   ```

   Beginning with NDB 8.0.22, you can also use the following
   statement:

   ```sql
   mysqlR> START REPLICA;
   ```

   Warning

   Only the primary channel must be started at this point. The
   secondary replication channel needs to be started only in
   the event that the primary replication channel fails, as
   described in
   [Section 25.7.8, “Implementing Failover with NDB Cluster Replication”](mysql-cluster-replication-failover.md "25.7.8 Implementing Failover with NDB Cluster Replication").
   Running multiple replication channels simultaneously can
   result in unwanted duplicate records being created on the
   replicas.

As mentioned previously, it is not necessary to enable binary
logging on the replicas.
