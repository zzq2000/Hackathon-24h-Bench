#### 22.4.3.4 Modify Documents

You can use the `modify()` method to update one
or more documents in a collection. The X DevAPI provides
additional methods for use with the `modify()`
method to:

- Set and unset fields within documents.
- Append, insert, and delete arrays.
- Bind, limit, and sort the documents to be modified.

##### Set and Unset Document Fields

The `modify()` method works by filtering a
collection to include only the documents to be modified and
then applying the operations that you specify to those
documents.

In the following example, the `modify()`
method uses the search condition to identify the document to
change and then the `set()` method replaces
two values within the nested demographics object.

```mysqlsh
mysql-py> db.countryinfo.modify("Code = 'SEA'").set(
"demographics", {"LifeExpectancy": 78, "Population": 28})
```

After you modify a document, use the `find()`
method to verify the change.

To remove content from a document, use the
`modify()` and `unset()`
methods. For example, the following query removes the GNP from
a document that matches the search condition.

```mysqlsh
mysql-py> db.countryinfo.modify("Name = 'Sealand'").unset("GNP")
```

Use the `find()` method to verify the change.

```mysqlsh
mysql-py> db.countryinfo.find("Name = 'Sealand'")
{
    "_id": "00005e2ff4af00000000000000f4",
    "Name": "Sealand",
    "Code:": "SEA",
    "IndepYear": 1967,
    "geography": {
        "Region": "British Islands",
        "Continent": "Europe",
        "SurfaceArea": 193
    },
    "government": {
        "HeadOfState": "Michael Bates",
        "GovernmentForm": "Monarchy"
    },
    "demographics": {
        "Population": 27,
        "LifeExpectancy": 79
    }
}
```

##### Append, Insert, and Delete Arrays

To append an element to an array field, or insert, or delete
elements in an array, use the
`array_append()`,
`array_insert()`, or
`array_delete()` methods. The following
examples modify the `countryinfo` collection
to enable tracking of international airports.

The first example uses the `modify()` and
`set()` methods to create a new Airports
field in all documents.

Caution

Use care when you modify documents without specifying a
search condition; doing so modifies all documents in the
collection.

```mysqlsh
mysql-py> db.countryinfo.modify("true").set("Airports", [])
```

With the Airports field added, the next example uses the
`array_append()` method to add a new airport
to one of the documents. *$.Airports* in
the following example represents the Airports field of the
current document.

```mysqlsh
mysql-py> db.countryinfo.modify("Name = 'France'").array_append("$.Airports", "ORY")
```

Use `find()` to see the change.

```mysqlsh
mysql-py> db.countryinfo.find("Name = 'France'")
{
    "GNP": 1424285,
    "_id": "00005de917d80000000000000048",
    "Code": "FRA",
    "Name": "France",
    "Airports": [
        "ORY"
    ],
    "IndepYear": 843,
    "geography": {
        "Region": "Western Europe",
        "Continent": "Europe",
        "SurfaceArea": 551500
    },
    "government": {
        "HeadOfState": "Jacques Chirac",
        "GovernmentForm": "Republic"
    },
    "demographics": {
        "Population": 59225700,
        "LifeExpectancy": 78.80000305175781
    }
}
```

To insert an element at a different position in the array, use
the `array_insert()` method to specify which
index to insert in the path expression. In this case, the
index is 0, or the first element in the array.

```mysqlsh
mysql-py> db.countryinfo.modify("Name = 'France'").array_insert("$.Airports[0]", "CDG")
```

To delete an element from the array, you must pass to the
`array_delete()` method the index of the
element to be deleted.

```mysqlsh
mysql-py> db.countryinfo.modify("Name = 'France'").array_delete("$.Airports[1]")
```
