The date and time data types for representing temporal values are
[`DATE`](datetime.md "13.2.2 The DATE, DATETIME, and TIMESTAMP Types"),
[`TIME`](time.md "13.2.3 The TIME Type"),
[`DATETIME`](datetime.md "13.2.2 The DATE, DATETIME, and TIMESTAMP Types"),
[`TIMESTAMP`](datetime.md "13.2.2 The DATE, DATETIME, and TIMESTAMP Types"), and
[`YEAR`](year.md "13.2.4 The YEAR Type"). Each temporal type has a
range of valid values, as well as a “zero” value that
may be used when you specify an invalid value that MySQL cannot
represent. The [`TIMESTAMP`](datetime.md "13.2.2 The DATE, DATETIME, and TIMESTAMP Types") and
[`DATETIME`](datetime.md "13.2.2 The DATE, DATETIME, and TIMESTAMP Types") types have special
automatic updating behavior, described in
[Section 13.2.5, “Automatic Initialization and Updating for TIMESTAMP and DATETIME”](timestamp-initialization.md "13.2.5 Automatic Initialization and Updating for TIMESTAMP and DATETIME").

For information about storage requirements of the temporal data
types, see [Section 13.7, “Data Type Storage Requirements”](storage-requirements.md "13.7 Data Type Storage Requirements").

For descriptions of functions that operate on temporal values, see
[Section 14.7, “Date and Time Functions”](date-and-time-functions.md "14.7 Date and Time Functions").

Keep in mind these general considerations when working with date
and time types:

- MySQL retrieves values for a given date or time type in a
  standard output format, but it attempts to interpret a variety
  of formats for input values that you supply (for example, when
  you specify a value to be assigned to or compared to a date or
  time type). For a description of the permitted formats for
  date and time types, see
  [Section 11.1.3, “Date and Time Literals”](date-and-time-literals.md "11.1.3 Date and Time Literals"). It is expected that
  you supply valid values. Unpredictable results may occur if
  you use values in other formats.
- Although MySQL tries to interpret values in several formats,
  date parts must always be given in year-month-day order (for
  example, `'98-09-04'`), rather than in the
  month-day-year or day-month-year orders commonly used
  elsewhere (for example, `'09-04-98'`,
  `'04-09-98'`). To convert strings in other
  orders to year-month-day order, the
  [`STR_TO_DATE()`](date-and-time-functions.md#function_str-to-date) function may be
  useful.
- Dates containing 2-digit year values are ambiguous because the
  century is unknown. MySQL interprets 2-digit year values using
  these rules:

  - Year values in the range `70-99` become
    `1970-1999`.
  - Year values in the range `00-69` become
    `2000-2069`.

  See also [Section 13.2.9, “2-Digit Years in Dates”](two-digit-years.md "13.2.9 2-Digit Years in Dates").
- Conversion of values from one temporal type to another occurs
  according to the rules in
  [Section 13.2.8, “Conversion Between Date and Time Types”](date-and-time-type-conversion.md "13.2.8 Conversion Between Date and Time Types").
- MySQL automatically converts a date or time value to a number
  if the value is used in numeric context and vice versa.
- By default, when MySQL encounters a value for a date or time
  type that is out of range or otherwise invalid for the type,
  it converts the value to the “zero” value for
  that type. The exception is that out-of-range
  [`TIME`](time.md "13.2.3 The TIME Type") values are clipped to the
  appropriate endpoint of the
  [`TIME`](time.md "13.2.3 The TIME Type") range.
- By setting the SQL mode to the appropriate value, you can
  specify more exactly what kind of dates you want MySQL to
  support. (See [Section 7.1.11, “Server SQL Modes”](sql-mode.md "7.1.11 Server SQL Modes").) You can get MySQL
  to accept certain dates, such as
  `'2009-11-31'`, by enabling the
  [`ALLOW_INVALID_DATES`](sql-mode.md#sqlmode_allow_invalid_dates) SQL
  mode. This is useful when you want to store a “possibly
  wrong” value which the user has specified (for example,
  in a web form) in the database for future processing. Under
  this mode, MySQL verifies only that the month is in the range
  from 1 to 12 and that the day is in the range from 1 to 31.
- MySQL permits you to store dates where the day or month and
  day are zero in a [`DATE`](datetime.md "13.2.2 The DATE, DATETIME, and TIMESTAMP Types") or
  [`DATETIME`](datetime.md "13.2.2 The DATE, DATETIME, and TIMESTAMP Types") column. This is useful
  for applications that need to store birthdates for which you
  may not know the exact date. In this case, you simply store
  the date as `'2009-00-00'` or
  `'2009-01-00'`. However, with dates such as
  these, you should not expect to get correct results for
  functions such as [`DATE_SUB()`](date-and-time-functions.md#function_date-sub) or
  [`DATE_ADD()`](date-and-time-functions.md#function_date-add) that require
  complete dates. To disallow zero month or day parts in dates,
  enable the [`NO_ZERO_IN_DATE`](sql-mode.md#sqlmode_no_zero_in_date)
  mode.
- MySQL permits you to store a “zero” value of
  `'0000-00-00'` as a “dummy
  date.” In some cases, this is more convenient than
  using `NULL` values, and uses less data and
  index space. To disallow `'0000-00-00'`,
  enable the [`NO_ZERO_DATE`](sql-mode.md#sqlmode_no_zero_date)
  mode.
- “Zero” date or time values used through
  Connector/ODBC are converted automatically to
  `NULL` because ODBC cannot handle such
  values.

The following table shows the format of the “zero”
value for each type. The “zero” values are special,
but you can store or refer to them explicitly using the values
shown in the table. You can also do this using the values
`'0'` or `0`, which are easier
to write. For temporal types that include a date part
([`DATE`](datetime.md "13.2.2 The DATE, DATETIME, and TIMESTAMP Types"),
[`DATETIME`](datetime.md "13.2.2 The DATE, DATETIME, and TIMESTAMP Types"), and
[`TIMESTAMP`](datetime.md "13.2.2 The DATE, DATETIME, and TIMESTAMP Types")), use of these values may
produce warning or errors. The precise behavior depends on which,
if any, of the strict and
[`NO_ZERO_DATE`](sql-mode.md#sqlmode_no_zero_date) SQL modes are
enabled; see [Section 7.1.11, “Server SQL Modes”](sql-mode.md "7.1.11 Server SQL Modes").

| Data Type | “Zero” Value |
| --- | --- |
| [`DATE`](datetime.md "13.2.2 The DATE, DATETIME, and TIMESTAMP Types") | `'0000-00-00'` |
| [`TIME`](time.md "13.2.3 The TIME Type") | `'00:00:00'` |
| [`DATETIME`](datetime.md "13.2.2 The DATE, DATETIME, and TIMESTAMP Types") | `'0000-00-00 00:00:00'` |
| [`TIMESTAMP`](datetime.md "13.2.2 The DATE, DATETIME, and TIMESTAMP Types") | `'0000-00-00 00:00:00'` |
| [`YEAR`](year.md "13.2.4 The YEAR Type") | `0000` |
