### 29.12.2 Performance Schema Setup Tables

[29.12.2.1 The setup\_actors Table](performance-schema-setup-actors-table.md)

[29.12.2.2 The setup\_consumers Table](performance-schema-setup-consumers-table.md)

[29.12.2.3 The setup\_instruments Table](performance-schema-setup-instruments-table.md)

[29.12.2.4 The setup\_objects Table](performance-schema-setup-objects-table.md)

[29.12.2.5 The setup\_threads Table](performance-schema-setup-threads-table.md)

The setup tables provide information about the current
instrumentation and enable the monitoring configuration to be
changed. For this reason, some columns in these tables can be
changed if you have the [`UPDATE`](privileges-provided.md#priv_update)
privilege.

The use of tables rather than individual variables for setup
information provides a high degree of flexibility in modifying
Performance Schema configuration. For example, you can use a
single statement with standard SQL syntax to make multiple
simultaneous configuration changes.

These setup tables are available:

- [`setup_actors`](performance-schema-setup-actors-table.md "29.12.2.1 The setup_actors Table"): How to initialize
  monitoring for new foreground threads
- [`setup_consumers`](performance-schema-setup-consumers-table.md "29.12.2.2 The setup_consumers Table"): The
  destinations to which event information can be sent and
  stored
- [`setup_instruments`](performance-schema-setup-instruments-table.md "29.12.2.3 The setup_instruments Table"): The classes
  of instrumented objects for which events can be collected
- [`setup_objects`](performance-schema-setup-objects-table.md "29.12.2.4 The setup_objects Table"): Which objects
  should be monitored
- [`setup_threads`](performance-schema-setup-threads-table.md "29.12.2.5 The setup_threads Table"): Instrumented
  thread names and attributes
