### 12.3.5 Column Character Set and Collation

Every “character” column (that is, a column of type
[`CHAR`](char.md "13.3.2 The CHAR and VARCHAR Types"),
[`VARCHAR`](char.md "13.3.2 The CHAR and VARCHAR Types"), a
[`TEXT`](blob.md "13.3.4 The BLOB and TEXT Types") type, or any synonym) has a
column character set and a column collation. Column definition
syntax for [`CREATE TABLE`](create-table.md "15.1.20 CREATE TABLE Statement") and
[`ALTER TABLE`](alter-table.md "15.1.9 ALTER TABLE Statement") has optional clauses
for specifying the column character set and collation:

```sql
col_name {CHAR | VARCHAR | TEXT} (col_length)
    [CHARACTER SET charset_name]
    [COLLATE collation_name]
```

These clauses can also be used for
[`ENUM`](enum.md "13.3.5 The ENUM Type") and
[`SET`](set.md "13.3.6 The SET Type") columns:

```sql
col_name {ENUM | SET} (val_list)
    [CHARACTER SET charset_name]
    [COLLATE collation_name]
```

Examples:

```sql
CREATE TABLE t1
(
    col1 VARCHAR(5)
      CHARACTER SET latin1
      COLLATE latin1_german1_ci
);

ALTER TABLE t1 MODIFY
    col1 VARCHAR(5)
      CHARACTER SET latin1
      COLLATE latin1_swedish_ci;
```

MySQL chooses the column character set and collation in the
following manner:

- If both `CHARACTER SET
  charset_name` and
  `COLLATE
  collation_name` are
  specified, character set
  *`charset_name`* and collation
  *`collation_name`* are used.

  ```sql
  CREATE TABLE t1
  (
      col1 CHAR(10) CHARACTER SET utf8mb4 COLLATE utf8mb4_unicode_ci
  ) CHARACTER SET latin1 COLLATE latin1_bin;
  ```

  The character set and collation are specified for the
  column, so they are used. The column has character set
  `utf8mb4` and collation
  `utf8mb4_unicode_ci`.
- If `CHARACTER SET
  charset_name` is
  specified without `COLLATE`, character set
  *`charset_name`* and its default
  collation are used.

  ```sql
  CREATE TABLE t1
  (
      col1 CHAR(10) CHARACTER SET utf8mb4
  ) CHARACTER SET latin1 COLLATE latin1_bin;
  ```

  The character set is specified for the column, but the
  collation is not. The column has character set
  `utf8mb4` and the default collation for
  `utf8mb4`, which is
  `utf8mb4_0900_ai_ci`. To see the default
  collation for each character set, use the
  [`SHOW CHARACTER SET`](show-character-set.md "15.7.7.3 SHOW CHARACTER SET Statement") statement
  or query the `INFORMATION_SCHEMA`
  [`CHARACTER_SETS`](information-schema-character-sets-table.md "28.3.4 The INFORMATION_SCHEMA CHARACTER_SETS Table") table.
- If `COLLATE
  collation_name` is
  specified without `CHARACTER SET`, the
  character set associated with
  *`collation_name`* and collation
  *`collation_name`* are used.

  ```sql
  CREATE TABLE t1
  (
      col1 CHAR(10) COLLATE utf8mb4_polish_ci
  ) CHARACTER SET latin1 COLLATE latin1_bin;
  ```

  The collation is specified for the column, but the character
  set is not. The column has collation
  `utf8mb4_polish_ci` and the character set
  is the one associated with the collation, which is
  `utf8mb4`.
- Otherwise (neither `CHARACTER SET` nor
  `COLLATE` is specified), the table
  character set and collation are used.

  ```sql
  CREATE TABLE t1
  (
      col1 CHAR(10)
  ) CHARACTER SET latin1 COLLATE latin1_bin;
  ```

  Neither the character set nor collation is specified for the
  column, so the table defaults are used. The column has
  character set `latin1` and collation
  `latin1_bin`.

The `CHARACTER SET` and
`COLLATE` clauses are standard SQL.

If you use [`ALTER TABLE`](alter-table.md "15.1.9 ALTER TABLE Statement") to convert
a column from one character set to another, MySQL attempts to
map the data values, but if the character sets are incompatible,
there may be data loss.
