#### 25.2.7.11 Previous NDB Cluster Issues Resolved in NDB Cluster 8.0

A number of limitations and related issues that existed in
earlier versions of NDB Cluster have been resolved in NDB
8.0. These are described briefly in the following
list:

- **Database and table names.**
  In NDB 7.6 and earlier, when using the
  `NDB` storage engine, the maximum allowed
  length both for database names and for table names was 63
  bytes, and a statement using a database name or table name
  longer than this limit failed with an appropriate error.
  In NDB 8.0, this restriction is lifted; identifiers for
  `NDB` databases and tables may now use up
  to 64 characters, as with other MySQL database and table
  names.
- **IPv6 support.**
  Prior to NDB 8.0.22, it was necessary for all network
  addresses used for connections between nodes within an NDB
  Cluster to use or to be resolvable to IPv4 addresses.
  Beginning with NDB 8.0.22, `NDB` supports
  IPv6 addresses for all types of cluster nodes, as well as
  for applications that use the NDB API or MGM API.

  [Known Issues When Upgrading or Downgrading NDB Cluster](mysql-cluster-upgrade-downgrade.md#mysql-cluster-updowngrade-issues "Known Issues When Upgrading or Downgrading NDB Cluster").
- **Multithreaded replicas.**
  In NDB 8.0.32 and earlier, multithreaded replicas were not
  supported for NDB Cluster Replication. This restriction is
  lifted in NDB Cluster 8.0.33.

  See [Section 25.7.3, “Known Issues in NDB Cluster Replication”](mysql-cluster-replication-issues.md "25.7.3 Known Issues in NDB Cluster Replication"), for
  more information.
