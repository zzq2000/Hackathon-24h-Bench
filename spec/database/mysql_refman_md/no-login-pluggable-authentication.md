#### 8.4.1.9 No-Login Pluggable Authentication

The `mysql_no_login` server-side authentication
plugin prevents all client connections to any account that uses
it. Use cases for this plugin include:

- Accounts that must be able to execute stored programs and
  views with elevated privileges without exposing those
  privileges to ordinary users.
- Proxied accounts that should never permit direct login but
  are intended to be accessed only through proxy accounts.

The following table shows the plugin and library file names. The
file name suffix might differ on your system. The file must be
located in the directory named by the
[`plugin_dir`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_plugin_dir) system variable.

**Table 8.25 Plugin and Library Names for No-Login Authentication**

| Plugin or File | Plugin or File Name |
| --- | --- |
| Server-side plugin | `mysql_no_login` |
| Client-side plugin | None |
| Library file | `mysql_no_login.so` |

For general information about pluggable authentication in MySQL,
see [Section 8.2.17, “Pluggable Authentication”](pluggable-authentication.md "8.2.17 Pluggable Authentication"). For proxy user
information, see [Section 8.2.19, “Proxy Users”](proxy-users.md "8.2.19 Proxy Users").

##### Installing No-Login Pluggable Authentication

This section describes how to install the no-login
authentication plugin. For general information about
installing plugins, see [Section 7.6.1, “Installing and Uninstalling Plugins”](plugin-loading.md "7.6.1 Installing and Uninstalling Plugins").

To be usable by the server, the plugin library file must be
located in the MySQL plugin directory (the directory named by
the [`plugin_dir`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_plugin_dir) system
variable). If necessary, configure the plugin directory
location by setting the value of
[`plugin_dir`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_plugin_dir) at server startup.

The plugin library file base name is
`mysql_no_login`. The file name suffix
differs per platform (for example, `.so`
for Unix and Unix-like systems, `.dll` for
Windows).

To load the plugin at server startup, use the
[`--plugin-load-add`](server-options.md#option_mysqld_plugin-load-add) option to
name the library file that contains it. With this
plugin-loading method, the option must be given each time the
server starts. For example, put these lines in the server
`my.cnf` file, adjusting the
`.so` suffix for your platform as
necessary:

```ini
[mysqld]
plugin-load-add=mysql_no_login.so
```

After modifying `my.cnf`, restart the
server to cause the new settings to take effect.

Alternatively, to load the plugin at runtime, use this
statement, adjusting the `.so` suffix for
your platform as necessary:

```sql
INSTALL PLUGIN mysql_no_login SONAME 'mysql_no_login.so';
```

[`INSTALL PLUGIN`](install-plugin.md "15.7.4.4 INSTALL PLUGIN Statement") loads the plugin
immediately, and also registers it in the
`mysql.plugins` system table to cause the
server to load it for each subsequent normal startup without
the need for [`--plugin-load-add`](server-options.md#option_mysqld_plugin-load-add).

To verify plugin installation, examine the Information Schema
[`PLUGINS`](information-schema-plugins-table.md "28.3.22 The INFORMATION_SCHEMA PLUGINS Table") table or use the
[`SHOW PLUGINS`](show-plugins.md "15.7.7.25 SHOW PLUGINS Statement") statement (see
[Section 7.6.2, “Obtaining Server Plugin Information”](obtaining-plugin-information.md "7.6.2 Obtaining Server Plugin Information")). For example:

```sql
mysql> SELECT PLUGIN_NAME, PLUGIN_STATUS
       FROM INFORMATION_SCHEMA.PLUGINS
       WHERE PLUGIN_NAME LIKE '%login%';
+----------------+---------------+
| PLUGIN_NAME    | PLUGIN_STATUS |
+----------------+---------------+
| mysql_no_login | ACTIVE        |
+----------------+---------------+
```

If the plugin fails to initialize, check the server error log
for diagnostic messages.

To associate MySQL accounts with the no-login plugin, see
[Using No-Login Pluggable Authentication](no-login-pluggable-authentication.md#no-login-pluggable-authentication-usage "Using No-Login Pluggable Authentication").

##### Uninstalling No-Login Pluggable Authentication

The method used to uninstall the no-login authentication
plugin depends on how you installed it:

- If you installed the plugin at server startup using a
  [`--plugin-load-add`](server-options.md#option_mysqld_plugin-load-add) option,
  restart the server without the option.
- If you installed the plugin at runtime using an
  [`INSTALL PLUGIN`](install-plugin.md "15.7.4.4 INSTALL PLUGIN Statement") statement,
  it remains installed across server restarts. To uninstall
  it, use [`UNINSTALL PLUGIN`](uninstall-plugin.md "15.7.4.6 UNINSTALL PLUGIN Statement"):

  ```sql
  UNINSTALL PLUGIN mysql_no_login;
  ```

##### Using No-Login Pluggable Authentication

This section describes how to use the no-login authentication
plugin to prevent accounts from being used for connecting from
MySQL client programs to the server. It is assumed that the
server is running with the no-login plugin enabled, as
described in
[Installing No-Login Pluggable Authentication](no-login-pluggable-authentication.md#no-login-pluggable-authentication-installation "Installing No-Login Pluggable Authentication").

To refer to the no-login authentication plugin in the
`IDENTIFIED WITH` clause of a
[`CREATE USER`](create-user.md "15.7.1.3 CREATE USER Statement") statement, use the
name `mysql_no_login`.

An account that authenticates using
`mysql_no_login` may be used as the
`DEFINER` for stored program and view
objects. If such an object definition also includes
`SQL SECURITY DEFINER`, it executes with that
account's privileges. DBAs can use this behavior to
provide access to confidential or sensitive data that is
exposed only through well-controlled interfaces.

The following example illustrates these principles. It defines
an account that does not permit client connections, and
associates with it a view that exposes only certain columns of
the `mysql.user` system table:

```sql
CREATE DATABASE nologindb;
CREATE USER 'nologin'@'localhost'
  IDENTIFIED WITH mysql_no_login;
GRANT ALL ON nologindb.*
  TO 'nologin'@'localhost';
GRANT SELECT ON mysql.user
  TO 'nologin'@'localhost';
CREATE DEFINER = 'nologin'@'localhost'
  SQL SECURITY DEFINER
  VIEW nologindb.myview
  AS SELECT User, Host FROM mysql.user;
```

To provide protected access to the view to an ordinary user,
do this:

```sql
GRANT SELECT ON nologindb.myview
  TO 'ordinaryuser'@'localhost';
```

Now the ordinary user can use the view to access the limited
information it presents:

```sql
SELECT * FROM nologindb.myview;
```

Attempts by the user to access columns other than those
exposed by the view result in an error, as do attempts to
select from the view by users not granted access to it.

Note

Because the `nologin` account cannot be
used directly, the operations required to set up objects
that it uses must be performed by `root` or
similar account that has the privileges required to create
the objects and set `DEFINER` values.

The `mysql_no_login` plugin is also useful in
proxying scenarios. (For a discussion of concepts involved in
proxying, see [Section 8.2.19, “Proxy Users”](proxy-users.md "8.2.19 Proxy Users").) An account that
authenticates using `mysql_no_login` may be
used as a proxied user for proxy accounts:

```sql
-- create proxied account
CREATE USER 'proxied_user'@'localhost'
  IDENTIFIED WITH mysql_no_login;
-- grant privileges to proxied account
GRANT ...
  ON ...
  TO 'proxied_user'@'localhost';
-- permit proxy_user to be a proxy account for proxied account
GRANT PROXY
  ON 'proxied_user'@'localhost'
  TO 'proxy_user'@'localhost';
```

This enables clients to access MySQL through the proxy account
(`proxy_user`) but not to bypass the proxy
mechanism by connecting directly as the proxied user
(`proxied_user`). A client who connects using
the `proxy_user` account has the privileges
of the `proxied_user` account, but
`proxied_user` itself cannot be used to
connect.

For alternative methods of protecting proxied accounts against
direct use, see
[Preventing Direct Login to Proxied Accounts](proxy-users.md#preventing-proxied-account-direct-login "Preventing Direct Login to Proxied Accounts").
