MySQL Server supports a keyring that enables internal server
components and plugins to securely store sensitive information for
later retrieval. The implementation comprises these elements:

- Keyring components and plugins that manage a backing store or
  communicate with a storage back end. Keyring use involves
  installing one from among the available components and
  plugins. Keyring components and plugins both manage keyring
  data but are configured differently and may have operational
  differences (see
  [Section 8.4.4.1, “Keyring Components Versus Keyring Plugins”](keyring-component-plugin-comparison.md "8.4.4.1 Keyring Components Versus Keyring Plugins")).

  These keyring components are available:

  - `component_keyring_file`: Stores keyring
    data in a file local to the server host. Available in
    MySQL Community Edition and MySQL Enterprise Edition distributions as of MySQL 8.0.24. See
    [Section 8.4.4.4, “Using the component\_keyring\_file File-Based Keyring Component”](keyring-file-component.md "8.4.4.4 Using the component_keyring_file File-Based Keyring Component").
  - `component_keyring_encrypted_file`:
    Stores keyring data in an encrypted, password-protected
    file local to the server host. Available in MySQL Enterprise Edition
    distributions as of MySQL 8.0.24. See
    [Section 8.4.4.5, “Using the component\_keyring\_encrypted\_file Encrypted File-Based Keyring
    Component”](keyring-encrypted-file-component.md "8.4.4.5 Using the component_keyring_encrypted_file Encrypted File-Based Keyring Component").
  - `component_keyring_oci`: Stores keyring
    data in the Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Vault. Available in MySQL Enterprise Edition distributions
    as of MySQL 8.0.31. See
    [Section 8.4.4.11, “Using the Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Vault Keyring Component”](keyring-oci-component.md "8.4.4.11 Using the Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Vault Keyring Component").

  These keyring plugins are available:

  - `keyring_file` (deprecated as of MySQL
    8.0.34): Stores keyring data in a file local to the server
    host. Available in MySQL Community Edition and MySQL Enterprise Edition distributions. See
    [Section 8.4.4.6, “Using the keyring\_file File-Based Keyring Plugin”](keyring-file-plugin.md "8.4.4.6 Using the keyring_file File-Based Keyring Plugin").
  - `keyring_encrypted_file` (deprecated as
    of MySQL 8.0.34): Stores keyring data in an encrypted,
    password-protected file local to the server host.
    Available in MySQL Enterprise Edition distributions. See
    [Section 8.4.4.7, “Using the keyring\_encrypted\_file Encrypted File-Based Keyring Plugin”](keyring-encrypted-file-plugin.md "8.4.4.7 Using the keyring_encrypted_file Encrypted File-Based Keyring Plugin").
  - `keyring_okv`: A KMIP 1.1 plugin for use
    with KMIP-compatible back end keyring storage products
    such as Oracle Key Vault and Gemalto SafeNet KeySecure
    Appliance. Available in MySQL Enterprise Edition distributions. See
    [Section 8.4.4.8, “Using the keyring\_okv KMIP Plugin”](keyring-okv-plugin.md "8.4.4.8 Using the keyring_okv KMIP Plugin").
  - `keyring_aws`: Communicates with the
    Amazon Web Services Key Management Service for key
    generation and uses a local file for key storage.
    Available in MySQL Enterprise Edition distributions. See
    [Section 8.4.4.9, “Using the keyring\_aws Amazon Web Services Keyring Plugin”](keyring-aws-plugin.md "8.4.4.9 Using the keyring_aws Amazon Web Services Keyring Plugin").
  - `keyring_hashicorp`: Communicates with
    HashiCorp Vault for back end storage. Available in MySQL Enterprise Edition
    distributions as of MySQL 8.0.18. See
    [Section 8.4.4.10, “Using the HashiCorp Vault Keyring Plugin”](keyring-hashicorp-plugin.md "8.4.4.10 Using the HashiCorp Vault Keyring Plugin").
  - `keyring_oci` (deprecated as of MySQL
    8.0.31): Communicates with Oracle Cloud Infrastructure
    Vault for back end storage. Available in MySQL Enterprise Edition
    distributions as of MySQL 8.0.22. See
    [Section 8.4.4.12, “Using the Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Vault Keyring Plugin”](keyring-oci-plugin.md "8.4.4.12 Using the Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Vault Keyring Plugin").
- A keyring service interface for keyring key management. This
  service is accessible at two levels:

  - SQL interface: In SQL statements, call the functions
    described in
    [Section 8.4.4.15, “General-Purpose Keyring Key-Management Functions”](keyring-functions-general-purpose.md "8.4.4.15 General-Purpose Keyring Key-Management Functions").
  - C interface: In C-language code, call the keyring service
    functions described in [Section 7.6.9.2, “The Keyring Service”](keyring-service.md "7.6.9.2 The Keyring Service").
- Key metadata access:

  - The Performance Schema
    [`keyring_keys`](performance-schema-keyring-keys-table.md "29.12.18.2 The keyring_keys table") table exposes
    metadata for keys in the keyring. Key metadata includes
    key IDs, key owners, and backend key IDs. The
    [`keyring_keys`](performance-schema-keyring-keys-table.md "29.12.18.2 The keyring_keys table") table does not
    expose any sensitive keyring data such as key contents.
    Available as of MySQL 8.0.16. See
    [Section 29.12.18.2, “The keyring\_keys table”](performance-schema-keyring-keys-table.md "29.12.18.2 The keyring_keys table").
  - The Performance Schema
    [`keyring_component_status`](performance-schema-keyring-component-status-table.md "29.12.18.1 The keyring_component_status Table")
    table provides status information about the keyring
    component in use, if one is installed. Available as of
    MySQL 8.0.24. See
    [Section 29.12.18.1, “The keyring\_component\_status Table”](performance-schema-keyring-component-status-table.md "29.12.18.1 The keyring_component_status Table").
- A key migration capability. MySQL supports migration of keys
  between keystores, enabling DBAs to switch a MySQL
  installation from one keystore to another. See
  [Section 8.4.4.14, “Migrating Keys Between Keyring Keystores”](keyring-key-migration.md "8.4.4.14 Migrating Keys Between Keyring Keystores").
- The implementation of keyring plugins is revised as of MySQL
  8.0.24 to use the component infrastructure. This is
  facilitated using the built-in plugin named
  `daemon_keyring_proxy_plugin` that acts as a
  bridge between the plugin and component service APIs. See
  [Section 7.6.8, “The Keyring Proxy Bridge Plugin”](daemon-keyring-proxy-plugin.md "7.6.8 The Keyring Proxy Bridge Plugin").

Warning

For encryption key management, the
`component_keyring_file` and
`component_keyring_encrypted_file` components,
and the `keyring_file` and
`keyring_encrypted_file` plugins are not
intended as a regulatory compliance solution. Security standards
such as PCI, FIPS, and others require use of key management
systems to secure, manage, and protect encryption keys in key
vaults or hardware security modules (HSMs).

Within MySQL, keyring service consumers include:

- The `InnoDB` storage engine uses the keyring
  to store its key for tablespace encryption. See
  [Section 17.13, “InnoDB Data-at-Rest Encryption”](innodb-data-encryption.md "17.13 InnoDB Data-at-Rest Encryption").
- MySQL Enterprise Audit uses the keyring to store the audit log file
  encryption password. See
  [Encrypting Audit Log Files](audit-log-logging-configuration.md#audit-log-file-encryption "Encrypting Audit Log Files").
- Binary log and relay log management supports keyring-based
  encryption of log files. With log file encryption activated,
  the keyring stores the keys used to encrypt passwords for the
  binary log files and relay log files. See
  [Section 19.3.2, “Encrypting Binary Log Files and Relay Log Files”](replication-binlog-encryption.md "19.3.2 Encrypting Binary Log Files and Relay Log Files").
- The master key to decrypt the file key that decrypts the
  persisted values of sensitive system variables is stored in
  the keyring. A keyring component must be enabled on the MySQL
  Server instance to support secure storage for persisted system
  variable values, rather than a keyring plugin, which do not
  support the function. See
  [Persisting Sensitive System Variables](persisted-system-variables.md#persisted-system-variables-sensitive "Persisting Sensitive System Variables").

For general keyring installation instructions, see
[Section 8.4.4.2, “Keyring Component Installation”](keyring-component-installation.md "8.4.4.2 Keyring Component Installation"), and
[Section 8.4.4.3, “Keyring Plugin Installation”](keyring-plugin-installation.md "8.4.4.3 Keyring Plugin Installation"). For installation
and configuration information specific to a given keyring
component or plugin, see the section describing it.

For information about using the keyring functions, see
[Section 8.4.4.15, “General-Purpose Keyring Key-Management Functions”](keyring-functions-general-purpose.md "8.4.4.15 General-Purpose Keyring Key-Management Functions").

Keyring components, plugins, and functions access a keyring
service that provides the interface to the keyring. For
information about accessing this service and writing keyring
plugins, see [Section 7.6.9.2, “The Keyring Service”](keyring-service.md "7.6.9.2 The Keyring Service"), and
[Writing Keyring Plugins](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/extending-mysql/8.0/en/writing-keyring-plugins.html).
