### 10.3.1 How MySQL Uses Indexes

Indexes are used to find rows with specific column values
quickly. Without an index, MySQL must begin with the first row
and then read through the entire table to find the relevant
rows. The larger the table, the more this costs. If the table
has an index for the columns in question, MySQL can quickly
determine the position to seek to in the middle of the data file
without having to look at all the data. This is much faster than
reading every row sequentially.

Most MySQL indexes (`PRIMARY KEY`,
`UNIQUE`, `INDEX`, and
`FULLTEXT`) are stored in
[B-trees](glossary.md#glos_b_tree "B-tree"). Exceptions: Indexes
on spatial data types use R-trees; `MEMORY`
tables also support [hash
indexes](glossary.md#glos_hash_index "hash index"); `InnoDB` uses inverted lists
for `FULLTEXT` indexes.

In general, indexes are used as described in the following
discussion. Characteristics specific to hash indexes (as used in
`MEMORY` tables) are described in
[Section 10.3.9, “Comparison of B-Tree and Hash Indexes”](index-btree-hash.md "10.3.9 Comparison of B-Tree and Hash Indexes").

MySQL uses indexes for these operations:

- To find the rows matching a `WHERE` clause
  quickly.
- To eliminate rows from consideration. If there is a choice
  between multiple indexes, MySQL normally uses the index that
  finds the smallest number of rows (the most
  [selective](glossary.md#glos_selectivity "selectivity") index).
- If the table has a multiple-column index, any leftmost
  prefix of the index can be used by the optimizer to look up
  rows. For example, if you have a three-column index on
  `(col1, col2, col3)`, you have indexed
  search capabilities on `(col1)`,
  `(col1, col2)`, and `(col1, col2,
  col3)`. For more information, see
  [Section 10.3.6, “Multiple-Column Indexes”](multiple-column-indexes.md "10.3.6 Multiple-Column Indexes").
- To retrieve rows from other tables when performing joins.
  MySQL can use indexes on columns more efficiently if they
  are declared as the same type and size. In this context,
  [`VARCHAR`](char.md "13.3.2 The CHAR and VARCHAR Types") and
  [`CHAR`](char.md "13.3.2 The CHAR and VARCHAR Types") are considered the same
  if they are declared as the same size. For example,
  `VARCHAR(10)` and
  `CHAR(10)` are the same size, but
  `VARCHAR(10)` and
  `CHAR(15)` are not.

  For comparisons between nonbinary string columns, both
  columns should use the same character set. For example,
  comparing a `utf8mb4` column with a
  `latin1` column precludes use of an index.

  Comparison of dissimilar columns (comparing a string column
  to a temporal or numeric column, for example) may prevent
  use of indexes if values cannot be compared directly without
  conversion. For a given value such as `1`
  in the numeric column, it might compare equal to any number
  of values in the string column such as
  `'1'`, `' 1'`,
  `'00001'`, or `'01.e1'`.
  This rules out use of any indexes for the string column.
- To find the [`MIN()`](aggregate-functions.md#function_min) or
  [`MAX()`](aggregate-functions.md#function_max) value for a specific
  indexed column *`key_col`*. This is
  optimized by a preprocessor that checks whether you are
  using `WHERE key_part_N =
  constant` on all key
  parts that occur before *`key_col`*
  in the index. In this case, MySQL does a single key lookup
  for each [`MIN()`](aggregate-functions.md#function_min) or
  [`MAX()`](aggregate-functions.md#function_max) expression and replaces
  it with a constant. If all expressions are replaced with
  constants, the query returns at once. For example:

  ```sql
  SELECT MIN(key_part2),MAX(key_part2)
    FROM tbl_name WHERE key_part1=10;
  ```
- To sort or group a table if the sorting or grouping is done
  on a leftmost prefix of a usable index (for example,
  `ORDER BY key_part1,
  key_part2`). If all key
  parts are followed by `DESC`, the key is
  read in reverse order. (Or, if the index is a descending
  index, the key is read in forward order.) See
  [Section 10.2.1.16, “ORDER BY Optimization”](order-by-optimization.md "10.2.1.16 ORDER BY Optimization"),
  [Section 10.2.1.17, “GROUP BY Optimization”](group-by-optimization.md "10.2.1.17 GROUP BY Optimization"), and
  [Section 10.3.13, “Descending Indexes”](descending-indexes.md "10.3.13 Descending Indexes").
- In some cases, a query can be optimized to retrieve values
  without consulting the data rows. (An index that provides
  all the necessary results for a query is called a
  [covering index](glossary.md#glos_covering_index "covering index").)
  If a query uses from a table only columns that are included
  in some index, the selected values can be retrieved from the
  index tree for greater speed:

  ```sql
  SELECT key_part3 FROM tbl_name
    WHERE key_part1=1
  ```

Indexes are less important for queries on small tables, or big
tables where report queries process most or all of the rows.
When a query needs to access most of the rows, reading
sequentially is faster than working through an index. Sequential
reads minimize disk seeks, even if not all the rows are needed
for the query. See [Section 10.2.1.23, “Avoiding Full Table Scans”](table-scan-avoidance.md "10.2.1.23 Avoiding Full Table Scans") for
details.
