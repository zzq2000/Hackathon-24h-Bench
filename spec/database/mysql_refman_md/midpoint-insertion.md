#### 10.10.2.3 Midpoint Insertion Strategy

By default, the key cache management system uses a simple LRU
strategy for choosing key cache blocks to be evicted, but it
also supports a more sophisticated method called the
midpoint insertion
strategy.

When using the midpoint insertion strategy, the LRU chain is
divided into two parts: a hot sublist and a warm sublist. The
division point between two parts is not fixed, but the key
cache management system takes care that the warm part is not
“too short,” always containing at least
[`key_cache_division_limit`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_key_cache_division_limit)
percent of the key cache blocks.
[`key_cache_division_limit`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_key_cache_division_limit) is a
component of structured key cache variables, so its value is a
parameter that can be set per cache.

When an index block is read from a table into the key cache,
it is placed at the end of the warm sublist. After a certain
number of hits (accesses of the block), it is promoted to the
hot sublist. At present, the number of hits required to
promote a block (3) is the same for all index blocks.

A block promoted into the hot sublist is placed at the end of
the list. The block then circulates within this sublist. If
the block stays at the beginning of the sublist for a long
enough time, it is demoted to the warm sublist. This time is
determined by the value of the
[`key_cache_age_threshold`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_key_cache_age_threshold)
component of the key cache.

The threshold value prescribes that, for a key cache
containing *`N`* blocks, the block at
the beginning of the hot sublist not accessed within the last
`N *
key_cache_age_threshold / 100` hits is to be moved to
the beginning of the warm sublist. It then becomes the first
candidate for eviction, because blocks for replacement always
are taken from the beginning of the warm sublist.

The midpoint insertion strategy enables you to keep
more-valued blocks always in the cache. If you prefer to use
the plain LRU strategy, leave the
[`key_cache_division_limit`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_key_cache_division_limit)
value set to its default of 100.

The midpoint insertion strategy helps to improve performance
when execution of a query that requires an index scan
effectively pushes out of the cache all the index blocks
corresponding to valuable high-level B-tree nodes. To avoid
this, you must use a midpoint insertion strategy with the
[`key_cache_division_limit`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_key_cache_division_limit) set
to much less than 100. Then valuable frequently hit nodes are
preserved in the hot sublist during an index scan operation as
well.
