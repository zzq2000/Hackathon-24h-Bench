### 27.5.4 The View WITH CHECK OPTION Clause

The `WITH CHECK OPTION` clause can be given for
an updatable view to prevent inserts to rows for which the
`WHERE` clause in the
*`select_statement`* is not true. It also
prevents updates to rows for which the `WHERE`
clause is true but the update would cause it to be not true (in
other words, it prevents visible rows from being updated to
nonvisible rows).

In a `WITH CHECK OPTION` clause for an updatable
view, the `LOCAL` and `CASCADED`
keywords determine the scope of check testing when the view is
defined in terms of another view. When neither keyword is given,
the default is `CASCADED`.

`WITH CHECK OPTION` testing is
standard-compliant:

- With `LOCAL`, the view
  `WHERE` clause is checked, then checking
  recurses to underlying views and applies the same rules.
- With `CASCADED`, the view
  `WHERE` clause is checked, then checking
  recurses to underlying views, adds `WITH CASCADED
  CHECK OPTION` to them (for purposes of the check;
  their definitions remain unchanged), and applies the same
  rules.
- With no check option, the view `WHERE` clause
  is not checked, then checking recurses to underlying views,
  and applies the same rules.

Consider the definitions for the following table and set of views:

```sql
CREATE TABLE t1 (a INT);
CREATE VIEW v1 AS SELECT * FROM t1 WHERE a < 2
WITH CHECK OPTION;
CREATE VIEW v2 AS SELECT * FROM v1 WHERE a > 0
WITH LOCAL CHECK OPTION;
CREATE VIEW v3 AS SELECT * FROM v1 WHERE a > 0
WITH CASCADED CHECK OPTION;
```

Here the `v2` and `v3` views are
defined in terms of another view, `v1`.

Inserts for `v2` are checked against its
`LOCAL` check option, then the check recurses to
`v1` and the rules are applied again. The rules
for `v1` cause a check failure. The check for
`v3` also fails:

```sql
mysql> INSERT INTO v2 VALUES (2);
ERROR 1369 (HY000): CHECK OPTION failed 'test.v2'
mysql> INSERT INTO v3 VALUES (2);
ERROR 1369 (HY000): CHECK OPTION failed 'test.v3'
```
