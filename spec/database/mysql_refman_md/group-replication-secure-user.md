#### 20.6.3.1 Secure User Credentials for Distributed Recovery

State transfer from the binary log requires a replication user
with the correct permissions so that Group Replication can
establish direct member-to-member replication channels. The same
replication user is used for distributed recovery on all the
group members. If group members have been set up to support the
use of a remote cloning operation as part of distributed
recovery, which is available from MySQL 8.0.17, this replication
user is also used as the clone user on the donor, and requires
the correct permissions for this role too. For detailed
instructions to set up this user, see
[Section 20.2.1.3, “User Credentials For Distributed Recovery”](group-replication-user-credentials.md "20.2.1.3 User Credentials For Distributed Recovery").

To secure the user credentials, you can require SSL for
connections with the user account, and (from MySQL 8.0.21) you
can provide the user credentials when Group Replication is
started, rather than storing them in the replica status tables.
Also, if you are using caching SHA-2 authentication, you must
set up RSA key-pairs on the group members.

Important

When using the MySQL communication stack
([`group_replication_communication_stack=MYSQL`](group-replication-system-variables.md#sysvar_group_replication_communication_stack))
AND secure connections between members
([`group_replication_ssl_mode`](group-replication-system-variables.md#sysvar_group_replication_ssl_mode)
is not set to `DISABLED`), the recovery users
must be properly set up, as they are also the users for group
communications. Follow the instructions in
[Section 20.6.3.1.2, “Replication User With SSL”](group-replication-secure-user.md#group-replication-secure-user-ssl "20.6.3.1.2 Replication User With SSL") and
[Section 20.6.3.1.3, “Providing Replication User Credentials Securely”](group-replication-secure-user.md#group-replication-secure-user-provide "20.6.3.1.3 Providing Replication User Credentials Securely").

##### 20.6.3.1.1 Replication User With The Caching SHA-2 Authentication Plugin

By default, users created in MySQL 8 use
[Section 8.4.1.2, “Caching SHA-2 Pluggable Authentication”](caching-sha2-pluggable-authentication.md "8.4.1.2 Caching SHA-2 Pluggable Authentication"). If
the replication user you configure for distributed recovery
uses the caching SHA-2 authentication plugin, and you are
*not* using SSL for distributed recovery
connections, RSA key-pairs are used for password exchange. For
more information on RSA key-pairs, see
[Section 8.3.3, “Creating SSL and RSA Certificates and Keys”](creating-ssl-rsa-files.md "8.3.3 Creating SSL and RSA Certificates and Keys").

In this situation, you can either copy the public key of the
`rpl_user` to the joining member, or
configure the donors to provide the public key when requested.
The more secure approach is to copy the public key of the
replication user account to the joining member. Then you need
to configure the
[`group_replication_recovery_public_key_path`](group-replication-system-variables.md#sysvar_group_replication_recovery_public_key_path)
system variable on the joining member with the path to the
public key for the replication user account.

The less secure approach is to set
[`group_replication_recovery_get_public_key=ON`](group-replication-system-variables.md#sysvar_group_replication_recovery_get_public_key)
on donors so that they provide the public key of the
replication user account to joining members. There is no way
to verify the identity of a server, therefore only set
[`group_replication_recovery_get_public_key=ON`](group-replication-system-variables.md#sysvar_group_replication_recovery_get_public_key)
when you are sure there is no risk of server identity being
compromised, for example by a man-in-the-middle attack.

##### 20.6.3.1.2 Replication User With SSL

A replication user that requires an SSL connection must be
created *before* the server joining the
group (the joining member) connects to the donor. Typically,
this is set up at the time you are provisioning a server to
join the group. To create a replication user for distributed
recovery that requires an SSL connection, issue these
statements on all servers that are going to participate in the
group:

```sql
mysql> SET SQL_LOG_BIN=0;
mysql> CREATE USER 'rec_ssl_user'@'%' IDENTIFIED BY 'password' REQUIRE SSL;
mysql> GRANT REPLICATION SLAVE ON *.* TO 'rec_ssl_user'@'%';
mysql> GRANT CONNECTION_ADMIN ON *.* TO 'rec_ssl_user'@'%';
mysql> GRANT BACKUP_ADMIN ON *.* TO 'rec_ssl_user'@'%';
mysql> GRANT GROUP_REPLICATION_STREAM ON *.* TO rec_ssl_user@'%';
mysql> FLUSH PRIVILEGES;
mysql> SET SQL_LOG_BIN=1;
```

Note

The [`GROUP_REPLICATION_STREAM`](privileges-provided.md#priv_group-replication-stream)
privilege is required when using both the MySQL
communication stack
([`group_replication_communication_stack=MYSQL`](group-replication-system-variables.md#sysvar_group_replication_communication_stack))
and secure connections between members
([`group_replication_ssl_mode`](group-replication-system-variables.md#sysvar_group_replication_ssl_mode)
not set to `DISABLED`). See
[Section 20.6.1, “Communication Stack for Connection Security Management”](group-replication-connection-security.md "20.6.1 Communication Stack for Connection Security Management").

##### 20.6.3.1.3 Providing Replication User Credentials Securely

To supply the user credentials for the replication user, you
can set them permanently as the credentials for the
`group_replication_recovery` channel, using a
[`CHANGE REPLICATION SOURCE TO`](change-replication-source-to.md "15.4.2.3 CHANGE REPLICATION SOURCE TO Statement") |
[`CHANGE MASTER TO`](change-master-to.md "15.4.2.1 CHANGE MASTER TO Statement") statement.
Alternatively, from MySQL 8.0.21, you can specify them on the
[`START GROUP_REPLICATION`](start-group-replication.md "15.4.3.1 START GROUP_REPLICATION Statement")
statement each time Group Replication is started. User
credentials specified on [`START
GROUP_REPLICATION`](start-group-replication.md "15.4.3.1 START GROUP_REPLICATION Statement") take precedence over any user
credentials that have been set using a
[`CHANGE REPLICATION SOURCE TO`](change-replication-source-to.md "15.4.2.3 CHANGE REPLICATION SOURCE TO Statement") |
[`CHANGE MASTER TO`](change-master-to.md "15.4.2.1 CHANGE MASTER TO Statement") statement.

User credentials set using [`CHANGE
REPLICATION SOURCE TO`](change-replication-source-to.md "15.4.2.3 CHANGE REPLICATION SOURCE TO Statement") | [`CHANGE
MASTER TO`](change-master-to.md "15.4.2.1 CHANGE MASTER TO Statement") are stored in plain text in the
replication metadata repositories on the server, but user
credentials specified on [`START
GROUP_REPLICATION`](start-group-replication.md "15.4.3.1 START GROUP_REPLICATION Statement") are saved in memory only, and are
removed by a [`STOP
GROUP_REPLICATION`](stop-group-replication.md "15.4.3.2 STOP GROUP_REPLICATION Statement") statement or server shutdown.
Using [`START GROUP_REPLICATION`](start-group-replication.md "15.4.3.1 START GROUP_REPLICATION Statement")
to specify the user credentials therefore helps to secure the
Group Replication servers against unauthorized access.
However, this method is not compatible with starting Group
Replication automatically, as specified by the
[`group_replication_start_on_boot`](group-replication-system-variables.md#sysvar_group_replication_start_on_boot)
system variable.

If you want to set the user credentials permanently using a
[`CHANGE REPLICATION SOURCE TO`](change-replication-source-to.md "15.4.2.3 CHANGE REPLICATION SOURCE TO Statement") |
[`CHANGE MASTER TO`](change-master-to.md "15.4.2.1 CHANGE MASTER TO Statement") statement,
issue this statement on the member that is going to join the
group:

```sql
mysql> CHANGE MASTER TO MASTER_USER='rec_ssl_user', MASTER_PASSWORD='password'
            FOR CHANNEL 'group_replication_recovery';

Or from MySQL 8.0.23:
mysql> CHANGE REPLICATION SOURCE TO SOURCE_USER='rec_ssl_user', SOURCE_PASSWORD='password'
            FOR CHANNEL 'group_replication_recovery';
```

To supply the user credentials on [`START
GROUP_REPLICATION`](start-group-replication.md "15.4.3.1 START GROUP_REPLICATION Statement"), issue this statement when
starting Group Replication for the first time, or after a
server restart:

```sql
mysql> START GROUP_REPLICATION USER='rec_ssl_user', PASSWORD='password';
```

Important

If you switch to using [`START
GROUP_REPLICATION`](start-group-replication.md "15.4.3.1 START GROUP_REPLICATION Statement") to specify user credentials on a
server that previously supplied the credentials using
[`CHANGE REPLICATION SOURCE TO`](change-replication-source-to.md "15.4.2.3 CHANGE REPLICATION SOURCE TO Statement")
| [`CHANGE MASTER TO`](change-master-to.md "15.4.2.1 CHANGE MASTER TO Statement"), you must
complete the following steps to get the security benefits of
this change.

1. Stop Group Replication on the group member using a
   [`STOP GROUP_REPLICATION`](stop-group-replication.md "15.4.3.2 STOP GROUP_REPLICATION Statement")
   statement. Although it is possible to take the following
   two steps while Group Replication is running, you need to
   restart Group Replication to implement the changes.
2. Set the value of the
   [`group_replication_start_on_boot`](group-replication-system-variables.md#sysvar_group_replication_start_on_boot)
   system variable to `OFF` (the default is
   `ON`).
3. Remove the distributed recovery credentials from the
   replica status tables by issuing this statement:

   ```sql
   mysql> CHANGE MASTER TO MASTER_USER='', MASTER_PASSWORD=''
               FOR CHANNEL 'group_replication_recovery';

   Or from MySQL 8.0.23:
   mysql> CHANGE REPLICATION SOURCE TO SOURCE_USER='', SOURCE_PASSWORD=''
               FOR CHANNEL 'group_replication_recovery';
   ```
4. Restart Group Replication on the group member using a
   [`START GROUP_REPLICATION`](start-group-replication.md "15.4.3.1 START GROUP_REPLICATION Statement")
   statement that specifies the distributed recovery user
   credentials.

Without these steps, the credentials remain stored in the
replica status tables, and can also be transferred to other
group members during remote cloning operations for distributed
recovery. The `group_replication_recovery`
channel could then be inadvertently started with the stored
credentials, on either the original member or members that
were cloned from it. An automatic start of Group Replication
on server boot (including after a remote cloning operation)
would use the stored user credentials, and they would also be
used if an operator did not specify the distributed recovery
credentials as part of [`START
GROUP_REPLICATION`](start-group-replication.md "15.4.3.1 START GROUP_REPLICATION Statement").
