#### 20.8.3.4 Group Replication Upgrade with mysqlbackup

As part of a provisioning approach you can use MySQL Enterprise Backup to copy and
restore the data from a group member to new members. However you
cannot use this technique to directly restore a backup taken
from a member running an older version of MySQL to a member
running a newer version of MySQL. The solution is to restore the
backup to a new server instance which is running the same
version of MySQL as the member which the backup was taken from,
and then upgrade the instance. This process consists of:

- Take a backup from a member of the older group using
  **mysqlbackup**. See
  [Section 20.5.6, “Using MySQL Enterprise Backup with Group Replication”](group-replication-enterprise-backup.md "20.5.6 Using MySQL Enterprise Backup with Group Replication").
- Deploy a new server instance, which must be running the same
  version of MySQL as the older member where the backup was
  taken.
- Restore the backup from the older member to the new instance
  using **mysqlbackup**.
- Upgrade MySQL on the new instance, see
  [Chapter 3, *Upgrading MySQL*](upgrading.md "Chapter 3 Upgrading MySQL").

Repeat this process to create a suitable number of new
instances, for example to be able to handle a failover. Then
join the instances to a group based on the
[Section 20.8.3.3, “Group Replication Online Upgrade Methods”](group-replication-online-upgrade-methods.md "20.8.3.3 Group Replication Online Upgrade Methods").`
