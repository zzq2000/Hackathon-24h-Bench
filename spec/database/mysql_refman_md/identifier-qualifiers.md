### 11.2.2 Identifier Qualifiers

Object names may be unqualified or qualified. An unqualified
name is permitted in contexts where interpretation of the name
is unambiguous. A qualified name includes at least one qualifier
to clarify the interpretive context by overriding a default
context or providing missing context.

For example, this statement creates a table using the
unqualified name `t1`:

```sql
CREATE TABLE t1 (i INT);
```

Because `t1` includes no qualifier to specify a
database, the statement creates the table in the default
database. If there is no default database, an error occurs.

This statement creates a table using the qualified name
`db1.t1`:

```sql
CREATE TABLE db1.t1 (i INT);
```

Because `db1.t1` includes a database qualifier
`db1`, the statement creates
`t1` in the database named
`db1`, regardless of the default database. The
qualifier *must* be specified if there is no
default database. The qualifier *may* be
specified if there is a default database, to specify a database
different from the default, or to make the database explicit if
the default is the same as the one specified.

Qualifiers have these characteristics:

- An unqualified name consists of a single identifier. A
  qualified name consists of multiple identifiers.
- The components of a multiple-part name must be separated by
  period (`.`) characters. The initial parts
  of a multiple-part name act as qualifiers that affect the
  context within which to interpret the final identifier.
- The qualifier character is a separate token and need not be
  contiguous with the associated identifiers. For example,
  *`tbl_name.col_name`* and
  *`tbl_name . col_name`* are
  equivalent.
- If any components of a multiple-part name require quoting,
  quote them individually rather than quoting the name as a
  whole. For example, write
  `` `my-table`.`my-column` ``, not
  `` `my-table.my-column` ``.
- A reserved word that follows a period in a qualified name
  must be an identifier, so in that context it need not be
  quoted.

The permitted qualifiers for object names depend on the object
type:

- A database name is fully qualified and takes no qualifier:

  ```sql
  CREATE DATABASE db1;
  ```
- A table, view, or stored program name may be given a
  database-name qualifier. Examples of unqualified and
  qualified names in `CREATE` statements:

  ```sql
  CREATE TABLE mytable ...;
  CREATE VIEW myview ...;
  CREATE PROCEDURE myproc ...;
  CREATE FUNCTION myfunc ...;
  CREATE EVENT myevent ...;

  CREATE TABLE mydb.mytable ...;
  CREATE VIEW mydb.myview ...;
  CREATE PROCEDURE mydb.myproc ...;
  CREATE FUNCTION mydb.myfunc ...;
  CREATE EVENT mydb.myevent ...;
  ```
- A trigger is associated with a table, so any qualifier
  applies to the table name:

  ```sql
  CREATE TRIGGER mytrigger ... ON mytable ...;

  CREATE TRIGGER mytrigger ... ON mydb.mytable ...;
  ```
- A column name may be given multiple qualifiers to indicate
  context in statements that reference it, as shown in the
  following table.

  | Column Reference | Meaning |
  | --- | --- |
  | *`col_name`* | Column *`col_name`* from whichever table used in the statement contains a column of that name |
  | *`tbl_name.col_name`* | Column *`col_name`* from table *`tbl_name`* of the default database |
  | *`db_name.tbl_name.col_name`* | Column *`col_name`* from table *`tbl_name`* of the database *`db_name`* |

  In other words, a column name may be given a table-name
  qualifier, which itself may be given a database-name
  qualifier. Examples of unqualified and qualified column
  references in `SELECT` statements:

  ```sql
  SELECT c1 FROM mytable
  WHERE c2 > 100;

  SELECT mytable.c1 FROM mytable
  WHERE mytable.c2 > 100;

  SELECT mydb.mytable.c1 FROM mydb.mytable
  WHERE mydb.mytable.c2 > 100;
  ```

You need not specify a qualifier for an object reference in a
statement unless the unqualified reference is ambiguous. Suppose
that column `c1` occurs only in table
`t1`, `c2` only in
`t2`, and `c` in both
`t1` and `t2`. Any unqualified
reference to `c` is ambiguous in a statement
that refers to both tables and must be qualified as
`t1.c` or `t2.c` to indicate
which table you mean:

```sql
SELECT c1, c2, t1.c FROM t1 INNER JOIN t2
WHERE t2.c > 100;
```

Similarly, to retrieve from a table `t` in
database `db1` and from a table
`t` in database `db2` in the
same statement, you must qualify the table references: For
references to columns in those tables, qualifiers are required
only for column names that appear in both tables. Suppose that
column `c1` occurs only in table
`db1.t`, `c2` only in
`db2.t`, and `c` in both
`db1.t` and `db2.t`. In this
case, `c` is ambiguous and must be qualified
but `c1` and `c2` need not be:

```sql
SELECT c1, c2, db1.t.c FROM db1.t INNER JOIN db2.t
WHERE db2.t.c > 100;
```

Table aliases enable qualified column references to be written
more simply:

```sql
SELECT c1, c2, t1.c FROM db1.t AS t1 INNER JOIN db2.t AS t2
WHERE t2.c > 100;
```
