#### B.3.2.4 Password Fails When Entered Interactively

MySQL client programs prompt for a password when invoked with
a [`--password`](connection-options.md#option_general_password) or
`-p` option that has no following password
value:

```terminal
$> mysql -u user_name -p
Enter password:
```

On some systems, you may find that your password works when
specified in an option file or on the command line, but not
when you enter it interactively at the `Enter
password:` prompt. This occurs when the library
provided by the system to read passwords limits password
values to a small number of characters (typically eight). That
is a problem with the system library, not with MySQL. To work
around it, change your MySQL password to a value that is eight
or fewer characters long, or put your password in an option
file.
