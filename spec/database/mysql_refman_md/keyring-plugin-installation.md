#### 8.4.4.3 Keyring Plugin Installation

Keyring service consumers require that a keyring component or
plugin be installed:

- To use a keyring plugin, begin with the instructions here.
  (Also, for general information about installing plugins, see
  [Section 7.6.1, “Installing and Uninstalling Plugins”](plugin-loading.md "7.6.1 Installing and Uninstalling Plugins").)
- To use a keyring component instead, begin with
  [Section 8.4.4.2, “Keyring Component Installation”](keyring-component-installation.md "8.4.4.2 Keyring Component Installation").
- If you intend to use keyring functions in conjunction with
  the chosen keyring component or plugin, install the
  functions after installing that component or plugin, using
  the instructions in
  [Section 8.4.4.15, “General-Purpose Keyring Key-Management Functions”](keyring-functions-general-purpose.md "8.4.4.15 General-Purpose Keyring Key-Management Functions").

Note

Only one keyring component or plugin should be enabled at a
time. Enabling multiple keyring components or plugins is
unsupported and results may not be as anticipated.

A keyring component must be enabled on the MySQL Server
instance if you need to support secure storage for persisted
system variable values, rather than a keyring plugin, which do
not support the function. See
[Persisting Sensitive System Variables](persisted-system-variables.md#persisted-system-variables-sensitive "Persisting Sensitive System Variables").

MySQL provides these keyring plugin choices:

- `keyring_file` (deprecated as of MySQL
  8.0.34): Stores keyring data in a file local to the server
  host. Available in MySQL Community Edition and MySQL Enterprise Edition distributions. For
  instructions about installing the component that replaces
  this plugin, see
  [Section 8.4.4.2, “Keyring Component Installation”](keyring-component-installation.md "8.4.4.2 Keyring Component Installation").
- `keyring_encrypted_file` (deprecated as of
  MySQL 8.0.34): Stores keyring data in an encrypted,
  password-protected file local to the server host. Available
  in MySQL Enterprise Edition distributions. For instructions about installing
  the component that replaces this plugin, see
  [Section 8.4.4.2, “Keyring Component Installation”](keyring-component-installation.md "8.4.4.2 Keyring Component Installation").
- `keyring_okv`: A KMIP 1.1 plugin for use
  with KMIP-compatible back end keyring storage products such
  as Oracle Key Vault and Gemalto SafeNet KeySecure Appliance.
  Available in MySQL Enterprise Edition distributions.
- `keyring_aws`: Communicates with the Amazon
  Web Services Key Management Service as a back end for key
  generation and uses a local file for key storage. Available
  in MySQL Enterprise Edition distributions.
- `keyring_hashicorp`: Communicates with
  HashiCorp Vault for back end storage. Available in MySQL Enterprise Edition
  distributions.
- `keyring_oci`(deprecated as of MySQL
  8.0.31): Communicates with Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Vault
  for back end storage. See
  [Section 8.4.4.12, “Using the Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Vault Keyring Plugin”](keyring-oci-plugin.md "8.4.4.12 Using the Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Vault Keyring Plugin").

To be usable by the server, the plugin library file must be
located in the MySQL plugin directory (the directory named by
the [`plugin_dir`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_plugin_dir) system
variable). If necessary, configure the plugin directory location
by setting the value of
[`plugin_dir`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_plugin_dir) at server startup.

A keyring component or plugin must be loaded early during the
server startup sequence so that other components can access it
as necessary during their own initialization. For example, the
`InnoDB` storage engine uses the keyring for
tablespace encryption, so a keyring component or plugin must be
loaded and available prior to `InnoDB`
initialization.

Installation for each keyring plugin is similar. The following
instructions describe how to install
`keyring_file`. To use a different keyring
plugin, substitute its name for `keyring_file`.

The `keyring_file` plugin library file base
name is `keyring_file`. The file name suffix
differs per platform (for example, `.so` for
Unix and Unix-like systems, `.dll` for
Windows).

To load the plugin, use the
[`--early-plugin-load`](server-options.md#option_mysqld_early-plugin-load) option to
name the plugin library file that contains it. For example, on
platforms where the plugin library file suffix is
`.so`, use these lines in the server
`my.cnf` file, adjusting the
`.so` suffix for your platform as necessary:

```ini
[mysqld]
early-plugin-load=keyring_file.so
```

Before starting the server, check the notes for your chosen
keyring plugin for configuration instructions specific to that
plugin:

- `keyring_file`:
  [Section 8.4.4.6, “Using the keyring\_file File-Based Keyring Plugin”](keyring-file-plugin.md "8.4.4.6 Using the keyring_file File-Based Keyring Plugin").
- `keyring_encrypted_file`:
  [Section 8.4.4.7, “Using the keyring\_encrypted\_file Encrypted File-Based Keyring Plugin”](keyring-encrypted-file-plugin.md "8.4.4.7 Using the keyring_encrypted_file Encrypted File-Based Keyring Plugin").
- `keyring_okv`:
  [Section 8.4.4.8, “Using the keyring\_okv KMIP Plugin”](keyring-okv-plugin.md "8.4.4.8 Using the keyring_okv KMIP Plugin").
- `keyring_aws`:
  [Section 8.4.4.9, “Using the keyring\_aws Amazon Web Services Keyring Plugin”](keyring-aws-plugin.md "8.4.4.9 Using the keyring_aws Amazon Web Services Keyring Plugin")
- `keyring_hashicorp`:
  [Section 8.4.4.10, “Using the HashiCorp Vault Keyring Plugin”](keyring-hashicorp-plugin.md "8.4.4.10 Using the HashiCorp Vault Keyring Plugin")
- `keyring_oci`:
  [Section 8.4.4.12, “Using the Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Vault Keyring Plugin”](keyring-oci-plugin.md "8.4.4.12 Using the Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Vault Keyring Plugin")

After performing any plugin-specific configuration, start the
server. Verify plugin installation by examining the Information
Schema [`PLUGINS`](information-schema-plugins-table.md "28.3.22 The INFORMATION_SCHEMA PLUGINS Table") table or use the
[`SHOW PLUGINS`](show-plugins.md "15.7.7.25 SHOW PLUGINS Statement") statement (see
[Section 7.6.2, “Obtaining Server Plugin Information”](obtaining-plugin-information.md "7.6.2 Obtaining Server Plugin Information")). For example:

```sql
mysql> SELECT PLUGIN_NAME, PLUGIN_STATUS
       FROM INFORMATION_SCHEMA.PLUGINS
       WHERE PLUGIN_NAME LIKE 'keyring%';
+--------------+---------------+
| PLUGIN_NAME  | PLUGIN_STATUS |
+--------------+---------------+
| keyring_file | ACTIVE        |
+--------------+---------------+
```

If the plugin fails to initialize, check the server error log
for diagnostic messages.

Plugins can be loaded by methods other than
[`--early-plugin-load`](server-options.md#option_mysqld_early-plugin-load), such as the
[`--plugin-load`](server-options.md#option_mysqld_plugin-load) or
[`--plugin-load-add`](server-options.md#option_mysqld_plugin-load-add) option or the
[`INSTALL PLUGIN`](install-plugin.md "15.7.4.4 INSTALL PLUGIN Statement") statement.
However, keyring plugins loaded using those methods may be
available too late in the server startup sequence for certain
components that use the keyring, such as
`InnoDB`:

- Plugin loading using
  [`--plugin-load`](server-options.md#option_mysqld_plugin-load) or
  [`--plugin-load-add`](server-options.md#option_mysqld_plugin-load-add) occurs
  after `InnoDB` initialization.
- Plugins installed using [`INSTALL
  PLUGIN`](install-plugin.md "15.7.4.4 INSTALL PLUGIN Statement") are registered in the
  `mysql.plugin` system table and loaded
  automatically for subsequent server restarts. However,
  because `mysql.plugin` is an
  `InnoDB` table, any plugins named in it can
  be loaded during startup only after
  `InnoDB` initialization.

If no keyring component or plugin is available when a component
tries to access the keyring service, the service cannot be used
by that component. As a result, the component may fail to
initialize or may initialize with limited functionality. For
example, if `InnoDB` finds that there are
encrypted tablespaces when it initializes, it attempts to access
the keyring. If the keyring is unavailable,
`InnoDB` can access only unencrypted
tablespaces. To ensure that `InnoDB` can access
encrypted tablespaces as well, use
[`--early-plugin-load`](server-options.md#option_mysqld_early-plugin-load) to load the
keyring plugin.
