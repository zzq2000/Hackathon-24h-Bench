#### 25.6.11.2 NDB Cluster Disk Data Storage Requirements

The following items apply to Disk Data storage requirements:

- Variable-length columns of Disk Data tables take up a fixed
  amount of space. For each row, this is equal to the space
  required to store the largest possible value for that
  column.

  For general information about calculating these values, see
  [Section 13.7, “Data Type Storage Requirements”](storage-requirements.md "13.7 Data Type Storage Requirements").

  You can obtain an estimate the amount of space available in
  data files and undo log files by querying the Information
  Schema [`FILES`](information-schema-files-table.md "28.3.15 The INFORMATION_SCHEMA FILES Table") table. For more
  information and examples, see
  [Section 28.3.15, “The INFORMATION\_SCHEMA FILES Table”](information-schema-files-table.md "28.3.15 The INFORMATION_SCHEMA FILES Table").

  Note

  The [`OPTIMIZE TABLE`](optimize-table.md "15.7.3.4 OPTIMIZE TABLE Statement")
  statement does not have any effect on Disk Data tables.
- In a Disk Data table, the first 256 bytes of a
  [`TEXT`](blob.md "13.3.4 The BLOB and TEXT Types") or
  [`BLOB`](blob.md "13.3.4 The BLOB and TEXT Types") column are stored in
  memory; only the remainder is stored on disk.
- Each row in a Disk Data table uses 8 bytes in memory to
  point to the data stored on disk. This means that, in some
  cases, converting an in-memory column to the disk-based
  format can actually result in greater memory usage. For
  example, converting a `CHAR(4)` column from
  memory-based to disk-based format increases the amount of
  [`DataMemory`](mysql-cluster-ndbd-definition.md#ndbparam-ndbd-datamemory) used per
  row from 4 to 8 bytes.

Important

Starting the cluster with the `--initial`
option does *not* remove Disk Data files.
You must remove these manually prior to performing an initial
restart of the cluster.

Performance of Disk Data tables can be improved by minimizing
the number of disk seeks by making sure that
[`DiskPageBufferMemory`](mysql-cluster-ndbd-definition.md#ndbparam-ndbd-diskpagebuffermemory) is
of sufficient size. You can query the
[`diskpagebuffer`](mysql-cluster-ndbinfo-diskpagebuffer.md "25.6.16.30 The ndbinfo diskpagebuffer Table") table to help
determine whether the value for this parameter needs to be
increased.
