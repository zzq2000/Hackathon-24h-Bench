#### 7.1.9.3 Persisted System Variables

The MySQL server maintains system variables that configure its
operation. A system variable can have a global value that
affects server operation as a whole, a session value that
affects the current session, or both. Many system variables are
dynamic and can be changed at runtime using the
[`SET`](set-variable.md "15.7.6.1 SET Syntax for Variable Assignment")
statement to affect operation of the current server instance.
[`SET`](set-variable.md "15.7.6.1 SET Syntax for Variable Assignment") can
also be used to persist certain global system variables to the
`mysqld-auto.cnf` file in the data directory,
to affect server operation for subsequent startups.
[`RESET PERSIST`](reset-persist.md "15.7.8.7 RESET PERSIST Statement") removes persisted
settings from `mysqld-auto.cnf`.

variables:

##### Overview of Persisted System Variables

The capability of persisting global system variables at
runtime enables server configuration that persists across
server startups. Although many system variables can be set at
startup from a `my.cnf` option file, or at
runtime using the
[`SET`](set-variable.md "15.7.6.1 SET Syntax for Variable Assignment")
statement, those methods of configuring the server either
require login access to the server host, or do not provide the
capability of persistently configuring the server at runtime
or remotely:

- Modifying an option file requires direct access to that
  file, which requires login access to the MySQL server
  host. This is not always convenient.
- Modifying system variables with
  [`SET
  GLOBAL`](set-variable.md "15.7.6.1 SET Syntax for Variable Assignment") is a runtime capability that can be done
  from clients run locally or from remote hosts, but the
  changes affect only the currently running server instance.
  The settings are not persistent and do not carry over to
  subsequent server startups.

To augment administrative capabilities for server
configuration beyond what is achievable by editing option
files or using
[`SET
GLOBAL`](set-variable.md "15.7.6.1 SET Syntax for Variable Assignment"), MySQL provides variants of
[`SET`](set-variable.md "15.7.6.1 SET Syntax for Variable Assignment")
syntax that persist system variable settings to a file named
`mysqld-auto.cnf` file in the data
directory. Examples:

```sql
SET PERSIST max_connections = 1000;
SET @@PERSIST.max_connections = 1000;

SET PERSIST_ONLY back_log = 100;
SET @@PERSIST_ONLY.back_log = 100;
```

MySQL also provides a [`RESET
PERSIST`](reset-persist.md "15.7.8.7 RESET PERSIST Statement") statement for removing persisted system
variables from `mysqld-auto.cnf`.

Server configuration performed by persisting system variables
has these characteristics:

- Persisted settings are made at runtime.
- Persisted settings are permanent. They apply across server
  restarts.
- Persisted settings can be made from local clients or
  clients who connect from a remote host. This provides the
  convenience of remotely configuring multiple MySQL servers
  from a central client host.
- To persist system variables, you need not have login
  access to the MySQL server host or file system access to
  option files. Ability to persist settings is controlled
  using the MySQL privilege system. See
  [Section 7.1.9.1, “System Variable Privileges”](system-variable-privileges.md "7.1.9.1 System Variable Privileges").
- An administrator with sufficient privileges can
  reconfigure a server by persisting system variables, then
  cause the server to use the changed settings immediately
  by executing a [`RESTART`](restart.md "15.7.8.8 RESTART Statement")
  statement.
- Persisted settings provide immediate feedback about
  errors. An error in a manually entered setting might not
  be discovered until much later.
  [`SET`](set-variable.md "15.7.6.1 SET Syntax for Variable Assignment")
  statements that persist system variables avoid the
  possibility of malformed settings because settings with
  syntax errors do not succeed and do not change server
  configuration.

##### Syntax for Persisting System Variables

These
[`SET`](set-variable.md "15.7.6.1 SET Syntax for Variable Assignment")
syntax options are available for persisting system variables:

- To persist a global system variable to the
  `mysqld-auto.cnf` option file in the
  data directory, precede the variable name by the
  `PERSIST` keyword or the
  `@@PERSIST.` qualifier:

  ```sql
  SET PERSIST max_connections = 1000;
  SET @@PERSIST.max_connections = 1000;
  ```

  Like [`SET
  GLOBAL`](set-variable.md "15.7.6.1 SET Syntax for Variable Assignment"),
  [`SET
  PERSIST`](set-variable.md "15.7.6.1 SET Syntax for Variable Assignment") sets the global variable runtime value,
  but also writes the variable setting to the
  `mysqld-auto.cnf` file (replacing any
  existing variable setting if there is one).
- To persist a global system variable to the
  `mysqld-auto.cnf` file without setting
  the global variable runtime value, precede the variable
  name by the `PERSIST_ONLY` keyword or the
  `@@PERSIST_ONLY.` qualifier:

  ```sql
  SET PERSIST_ONLY back_log = 1000;
  SET @@PERSIST_ONLY.back_log = 1000;
  ```

  Like `PERSIST`,
  `PERSIST_ONLY` writes the variable
  setting to `mysqld-auto.cnf`. However,
  unlike `PERSIST`,
  `PERSIST_ONLY` does not modify the global
  variable runtime value. This makes
  `PERSIST_ONLY` suitable for configuring
  read-only system variables that can be set only at server
  startup.

For more information about
[`SET`](set-variable.md "15.7.6.1 SET Syntax for Variable Assignment"),
see [Section 15.7.6.1, “SET Syntax for Variable Assignment”](set-variable.md "15.7.6.1 SET Syntax for Variable Assignment").

These [`RESET PERSIST`](reset-persist.md "15.7.8.7 RESET PERSIST Statement") syntax
options are available for removing persisted system variables:

- To remove all persisted variables from
  `mysqld-auto.cnf`, use
  [`RESET PERSIST`](reset-persist.md "15.7.8.7 RESET PERSIST Statement") without
  naming any system variable:

  ```sql
  RESET PERSIST;
  ```
- To remove a specific persisted variable from
  `mysqld-auto.cnf`, name it in the
  statement:

  ```sql
  RESET PERSIST system_var_name;
  ```

  This includes plugin system variables, even if the plugin
  is not currently installed. If the variable is not present
  in the file, an error occurs.
- To remove a specific persisted variable from
  `mysqld-auto.cnf`, but produce a
  warning rather than an error if the variable is not
  present in the file, add an `IF EXISTS`
  clause to the previous syntax:

  ```sql
  RESET PERSIST IF EXISTS system_var_name;
  ```

For more information about [`RESET
PERSIST`](reset-persist.md "15.7.8.7 RESET PERSIST Statement"), see [Section 15.7.8.7, “RESET PERSIST Statement”](reset-persist.md "15.7.8.7 RESET PERSIST Statement").

Using
[`SET`](set-variable.md "15.7.6.1 SET Syntax for Variable Assignment") to
persist a global system variable to a value of
`DEFAULT` or to its literal default value
assigns the variable its default value and adds a setting for
the variable to `mysqld-auto.cnf`. To
remove the variable from the file, use
[`RESET PERSIST`](reset-persist.md "15.7.8.7 RESET PERSIST Statement").

Some system variables cannot be persisted. See
[Section 7.1.9.4, “Nonpersistible and Persist-Restricted System Variables”](nonpersistible-system-variables.md "7.1.9.4 Nonpersistible and Persist-Restricted System Variables").

A system variable implemented by a plugin can be persisted if
the plugin is installed when the
[`SET`](set-variable.md "15.7.6.1 SET Syntax for Variable Assignment")
statement is executed. Assignment of the persisted plugin
variable takes effect for subsequent server restarts if the
plugin is still installed. If the plugin is no longer
installed, the plugin variable does not exist when the server
reads the `mysqld-auto.cnf` file. In this
case, the server writes a warning to the error log and
continues:

```simple
currently unknown variable 'var_name'
was read from the persisted config file
```

##### Obtaining Information About Persisted System Variables

The Performance Schema
[`persisted_variables`](performance-schema-persisted-variables-table.md "29.12.14.1 Performance Schema persisted_variables Table") table
provides an SQL interface to the
`mysqld-auto.cnf` file, enabling its
contents to be inspected at runtime using
[`SELECT`](select.md "15.2.13 SELECT Statement") statements. See
[Section 29.12.14.1, “Performance Schema persisted\_variables Table”](performance-schema-persisted-variables-table.md "29.12.14.1 Performance Schema persisted_variables Table").

The Performance Schema
[`variables_info`](performance-schema-variables-info-table.md "29.12.14.2 Performance Schema variables_info Table") table contains
information showing when and by which user each system
variable was most recently set. See
[Section 29.12.14.2, “Performance Schema variables\_info Table”](performance-schema-variables-info-table.md "29.12.14.2 Performance Schema variables_info Table").

[`RESET PERSIST`](reset-persist.md "15.7.8.7 RESET PERSIST Statement") affects the
contents of the
[`persisted_variables`](performance-schema-persisted-variables-table.md "29.12.14.1 Performance Schema persisted_variables Table") table because
the table contents correspond to the contents of the
`mysqld-auto.cnf` file. On the other hand,
because [`RESET PERSIST`](reset-persist.md "15.7.8.7 RESET PERSIST Statement") does not
change variable values, it has no effect on the contents of
the [`variables_info`](performance-schema-variables-info-table.md "29.12.14.2 Performance Schema variables_info Table") table until
the server is restarted.

##### Format and Server Handling of the mysqld-auto.cnf File

The `mysqld-auto.cnf` file uses a
`JSON` format like this (reformatted slightly
for readability):

```json
{
  "Version": 1,
  "mysql_server": {
    "max_connections": {
      "Value": "152",
      "Metadata": {
        "Timestamp": 1519921341372531,
        "User": "root",
        "Host": "localhost"
      }
    },
    "transaction_isolation": {
      "Value": "READ-COMMITTED",
      "Metadata": {
        "Timestamp": 1519921553880520,
        "User": "root",
        "Host": "localhost"
      }
    },
    "mysql_server_static_options": {
      "innodb_api_enable_mdl": {
        "Value": "0",
        "Metadata": {
          "Timestamp": 1519922873467872,
          "User": "root",
          "Host": "localhost"
        }
      },
      "log_slave_updates": {
        "Value": "1",
        "Metadata": {
          "Timestamp": 1519925628441588,
          "User": "root",
          "Host": "localhost"
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

At startup, the server processes the
`mysqld-auto.cnf` file after all other
option files (see [Section 6.2.2.2, “Using Option Files”](option-files.md "6.2.2.2 Using Option Files")). The server
handles the file contents as follows:

- If the
  [`persisted_globals_load`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_persisted_globals_load)
  system variable is disabled, the server ignores the
  `mysqld-auto.cnf` file.
- The `"mysql_server_static_options"`
  section contains read-only variables persisted using
  [`SET
  PERSIST_ONLY`](set-variable.md "15.7.6.1 SET Syntax for Variable Assignment"). The section may also (despite its
  name) contain certain dynamic variables that are not read
  only. All variables present inside this section are
  appended to the command line and processed with other
  command-line options.
- All remaining persisted variables are set by executing the
  equivalent of a
  [`SET
  GLOBAL`](set-variable.md "15.7.6.1 SET Syntax for Variable Assignment") statement later, just before the server
  starts listening for client connections. These settings
  therefore do not take effect until late in the startup
  process, which might be unsuitable for certain system
  variables. It may be preferable to set such variables in
  `my.cnf` rather than in
  `mysqld-auto.cnf`.

Management of the `mysqld-auto.cnf` file
should be left to the server. Manipulation of the file should
be performed only using
[`SET`](set-variable.md "15.7.6.1 SET Syntax for Variable Assignment")
and [`RESET PERSIST`](reset-persist.md "15.7.8.7 RESET PERSIST Statement") statements,
not manually:

- Removal of the file results in a loss of all persisted
  settings at the next server startup. (This is permissible
  if your intent is to reconfigure the server without these
  settings.) To remove all settings in the file without
  removing the file itself, use this statement:

  ```sql
  RESET PERSIST;
  ```
- Manual changes to the file may result in a parse error at
  server startup. In this case, the server reports an error
  and exits. If this issue occurs, start the server with the
  [`persisted_globals_load`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_persisted_globals_load)
  system variable disabled or with the
  [`--no-defaults`](server-options.md#option_mysqld_no-defaults) option.
  Alternatively, remove the
  `mysqld-auto.cnf` file. However, as
  noted previously, removing this file results in a loss of
  all persisted settings.

##### Persisting Sensitive System Variables

From MySQL 8.0.29, MySQL Server has the capability to securely
store persisted system variable values containing sensitive
data such as private keys or passwords, and restrict viewing
of the values. No MySQL Server system variables are currently
marked as sensitive, but the new capability allows system
variables containing sensitive data to be persisted securely
in the future. After upgrading to MySQL 8.0.29, the format of
the `mysqld-auto.cnf` option file remains
the same until the first time a
[`SET
PERSIST`](set-variable.md "15.7.6.1 SET Syntax for Variable Assignment") or
[`SET PERSIST
ONLY`](set-variable.md "15.7.6.1 SET Syntax for Variable Assignment") statement is issued, and at that point it is
changed to a new format, even if the system variable involved
is not sensitive. In the new format, the option file cannot be
read by older releases of MySQL Server.

Note

A keyring component must be enabled on the MySQL Server
instance to support secure storage for persisted system
variable values, rather than a keyring plugin, which do not
support the function. See [Section 8.4.4, “The MySQL Keyring”](keyring.md "8.4.4 The MySQL Keyring").

In the `mysqld-auto.cnf` option file, the
names and values of sensitive system variables are stored in
an encrypted format, along with a generated file key to
decrypt them. The generated file key is in turn encrypted
using a master key
(`persisted_variables_key`) that is stored in
a keyring. When the server starts up, the persisted sensitive
system variables are decrypted and used. By default, if
encrypted values are present in the option file but cannot be
successfully decrypted at startup, their default settings are
used. The optional most secure setting makes the server halt
startup if the encrypted values cannot be decrypted.

The system variable
[`persist_sensitive_variables_in_plaintext`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_persist_sensitive_variables_in_plaintext)
controls whether the server is permitted to store the values
of sensitive system variables in an unencrypted format, if
keyring component support is not available at the time when
[`SET
PERSIST`](set-variable.md "15.7.6.1 SET Syntax for Variable Assignment") is used to set the value. It also controls
whether or not the server can start if the encrypted values
cannot be decrypted.

- The default setting, `ON`, encrypts the
  values if keyring component support is available, and
  persists them unencrypted (with a warning) if it is not.
  The next time any persisted system variable is set, if
  keyring support is available at that time, the server
  encrypts the values of any unencrypted sensitive system
  variables. The `ON` setting also allows
  the server to start if encrypted system variable values
  cannot be decrypted, in which case a warning is issued and
  the default values for the system variables are used. In
  that situation, their values cannot be changed until they
  can be decrypted.
- The most secure setting, `OFF`, means
  sensitive system variable values cannot be persisted if
  keyring component support is unavailable. The
  `OFF` setting also means the server does
  not start if encrypted system variable values cannot be
  decrypted.

The privilege
[`SENSITIVE_VARIABLES_OBSERVER`](privileges-provided.md#priv_sensitive-variables-observer)
allows a holder to view the values of sensitive system
variables in the Performance Schema tables
[`global_variables`](performance-schema-system-variable-tables.md "29.12.14 Performance Schema System Variable Tables"),
[`session_variables`](performance-schema-system-variable-tables.md "29.12.14 Performance Schema System Variable Tables"),
[`variables_by_thread`](performance-schema-system-variable-tables.md "29.12.14 Performance Schema System Variable Tables"), and
[`persisted_variables`](performance-schema-persisted-variables-table.md "29.12.14.1 Performance Schema persisted_variables Table"),
to issue `SELECT` statements to return their
values, and to track changes to them in session trackers for
connections. Users without this privilege cannot view or track
those system variable values.

If a `SET` statement is issued for a
sensitive system variable, the query is rewritten to replace
the value with “`<redacted>`”
before it is logged to the general log and audit log. This
takes place even if secure storage through a keyring component
is not available on the server instance.
