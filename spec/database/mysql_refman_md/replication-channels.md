### 19.2.2 Replication Channels

In MySQL multi-source replication, a replica opens multiple
replication channels, one for each source server. The replication
channels represent the path of transactions flowing from a source to
the replica. Each replication channel has its own receiver (I/O)
thread, one or more applier (SQL) threads, and relay log. When
transactions from a source are received by a channel's receiver
thread, they are added to the channel's relay log file and
passed through to the channel's applier threads. This enables each
channel to function independently.

This section describes how channels can be used in a replication
topology, and the impact they have on single-source replication. For
instructions to configure sources and replicas for multi-source
replication, to start, stop and reset multi-source replicas, and to
monitor multi-source replication, see
[Section 19.1.5, “MySQL Multi-Source Replication”](replication-multi-source.md "19.1.5 MySQL Multi-Source Replication").

The maximum number of channels that can be created on one replica
server in a multi-source replication topology is 256. Each
replication channel must have a unique (nonempty) name, as explained
in [Section 19.2.2.4, “Replication Channel Naming Conventions”](channels-naming-conventions.md "19.2.2.4 Replication Channel Naming Conventions"). The error codes
and messages that are issued when multi-source replication is
enabled specify the channel that generated the error.

Note

Each channel on a multi-source replica must replicate from a
different source. You cannot set up multiple replication channels
from a single replica to a single source. This is because the
server IDs of replicas must be unique in a replication topology.
The source distinguishes replicas only by their server IDs, not by
the names of the replication channels, so it cannot recognize
different replication channels from the same replica.

A multi-source replica can also be set up as a multi-threaded
replica, by setting the system variable
[`replica_parallel_workers`](replication-options-replica.md#sysvar_replica_parallel_workers) (from
MySQL 8.0.26) or
[`slave_parallel_workers`](replication-options-replica.md#sysvar_slave_parallel_workers) (before
MySQL 8.0.26) to a value greater than 0. When you do this on a
multi-source replica, each channel on the replica has the specified
number of applier threads, plus a coordinator thread to manage them.
You cannot configure the number of applier threads for individual
channels.

From MySQL 8.0, multi-source replicas can be configured with
replication filters on specific replication channels. Channel
specific replication filters can be used when the same database or
table is present on multiple sources, and you only need the replica
to replicate it from one source. For GTID-based replication, if the
same transaction might arrive from multiple sources (such as in a
diamond topology), you must ensure the filtering setup is the same
on all channels. For more information, see
[Section 19.2.5.4, “Replication Channel Based Filters”](replication-rules-channel-based-filters.md "19.2.5.4 Replication Channel Based Filters").

To provide compatibility with previous versions, the MySQL server
automatically creates on startup a default channel whose name is the
empty string (`""`). This channel is always
present; it cannot be created or destroyed by the user. If no other
channels (having nonempty names) have been created, replication
statements act on the default channel only, so that all replication
statements from older replicas function as expected (see
[Section 19.2.2.2, “Compatibility with Previous Replication Statements”](channels-with-prev-replication.md "19.2.2.2 Compatibility with Previous Replication Statements"). Statements
applying to replication channels as described in this section can be
used only when there is at least one named channel.
