#### 7.6.7.5 Cloning Encrypted Data

Cloning of encrypted data is supported. The following
requirements apply:

- A secure connection is required when cloning remote data to
  ensure safe transfer of unencrypted tablespace keys over the
  network. Tablespace keys are decrypted at the donor before
  transport and re-encrypted at the recipient using the
  recipient master key. An error is reported if an encrypted
  connection is not available or the `REQUIRE NO
  SSL` clause is used in the
  [`CLONE
  INSTANCE`](clone.md "15.7.5 CLONE Statement") statement. For information about
  configuring an encrypted connection for cloning, see
  [Configuring an Encrypted Connection for Cloning](clone-plugin-remote.md#clone-plugin-remote-ssl "Configuring an Encrypted Connection for Cloning").
- When cloning data to a local data directory that uses a
  locally managed keyring, the same keyring must be used when
  starting the MySQL server on the clone directory.
- When cloning data to a remote data directory (the recipient
  directory) that uses a locally managed keyring, the
  recipient keyring must be used when starting the MySQL sever
  on the cloned directory.

Note

The [`innodb_redo_log_encrypt`](innodb-parameters.md#sysvar_innodb_redo_log_encrypt)
and [`innodb_undo_log_encrypt`](innodb-parameters.md#sysvar_innodb_undo_log_encrypt)
variable settings cannot be modified while a cloning operation
is in progress.

For information about the data encryption feature, see
[Section 17.13, “InnoDB Data-at-Rest Encryption”](innodb-data-encryption.md "17.13 InnoDB Data-at-Rest Encryption").
