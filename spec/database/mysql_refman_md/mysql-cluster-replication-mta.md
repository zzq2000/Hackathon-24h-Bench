Beginning with NDB 8.0.33, NDB replication supports the use of the
generic MySQL Server Multithreaded Applier mechanism (MTA), which
allows independent binary log transactions to be applied in
parallel on a replica, increasing peak replication throughput.

#### Requirements

The MySQL Server MTA implementation delegates the processing of
separate binary log transactions to a pool of worker threads
(whose size is configurable), and coordinates the worker threads
to ensure that transaction dependencies encoded in the binary log
are respected, and that commit ordering is maintained if required
(see [Section 19.2.3, “Replication Threads”](replication-threads.md "19.2.3 Replication Threads")). To use this
functionality with NDB Cluster, it is necessary that the following
three conditions be met:

1. *Binary log transaction dependencies are determined
   at the source*.

   For this to be true, the
   [`binlog_transaction_dependency_tracking`](replication-options-binary-log.md#sysvar_binlog_transaction_dependency_tracking)
   server system variable must be set to
   `WRITESET` on the source. This is supported
   by NDB 8.0.33 and later. (The default is
   `COMMIT_ORDER`.)

   Writeset maintenance work in `NDB` is
   performed by the MySQL binary log injector thread as part of
   preparing and committing each epoch transaction to the binary
   log. This requires extra resources, and may reduce peak
   throughput.
2. *Transaction dependencies are encoded into the binary
   log*.

   NDB 8.0.33 and later supports the
   [`--ndb-log-transaction-dependency`](mysql-cluster-options-variables.md#option_mysqld_ndb-log-transaction-dependency)
   startup option for [**mysqld**](mysqld.md "6.3.1 mysqld — The MySQL Server"); set this option
   to `ON` to enable writing of
   `NDB` transaction dependencies into the
   binary log.
3. *The replica is configured to use multiple worker
   threads*.

   NDB 8.0.33 and later supports setting
   [`replica_parallel_workers`](replication-options-replica.md#sysvar_replica_parallel_workers) to
   nonzero values to control the number of worker threads on the
   replica. The default is 4.

#### MTA Configuration: Source

Source [**mysqld**](mysqld.md "6.3.1 mysqld — The MySQL Server") configuration for the
`NDB` MTA must include the following explicit
settings:

- [`binlog_transaction_dependency_tracking`](replication-options-binary-log.md#sysvar_binlog_transaction_dependency_tracking)
  must be set to `WRITESET`.
- The replication source mysqld must be started with
  [`--ndb-log-transaction-dependency=ON`](mysql-cluster-options-variables.md#option_mysqld_ndb-log-transaction-dependency).

If set, [`replica_parallel_type`](replication-options-replica.md#sysvar_replica_parallel_type)
must be `LOGICAL_CLOCK` (the default value).

Note

`NDB` does not support
`replica_parallel_type=DATABASE`.

In addition, it is recommended that you set the amount of memory
used to track binary log transaction writesets on the source
([`binlog_transaction_dependency_history_size`](replication-options-binary-log.md#sysvar_binlog_transaction_dependency_history_size))
to `E *
P`, where
*`E`* is the average epoch size (as the
number of operations per epoch) and *`P`*
is the maximum expected parallelism. See
[Writeset Tracking Memory Usage](mysql-cluster-replication-mta.md#cluster-replication-mta-writeset-tracking "Writeset Tracking Memory Usage"), for
more information.

#### MTA Configuration: Replica

Replica [**mysqld**](mysqld.md "6.3.1 mysqld — The MySQL Server") configuration for the
`NDB` MTA requires that
[`replica_parallel_workers`](replication-options-replica.md#sysvar_replica_parallel_workers) is
greater than 1. The recommended starting value when first enabling
MTA is 4, which is the default.

In addition,
[`replica_preserve_commit_order`](replication-options-replica.md#sysvar_replica_preserve_commit_order)
must be `ON`. This is also the default value.

#### Transaction Dependency and Writeset Handling

Transaction dependencies are detected using analysis of each
transaction's writeset, that is, the set of rows (table, key
values) written by the transaction. Where two transactions modify
the same row they are considered to be dependent, and must be
applied in order (in other words, serially) to avoid deadlocks or
incorrect results. Where a table has secondary unique keys, these
values are also added to the transaction's writeset to detect
the case where there are transaction dependencies implied by
different transactions affecting the same unique key value, and so
requiring ordering. Where dependencies cannot be efficiently
determined, [**mysqld**](mysqld.md "6.3.1 mysqld — The MySQL Server") falls back to considering
transactions dependent for reasons of safety.

Transaction dependencies are encoded in the binary log by the
source [**mysqld**](mysqld.md "6.3.1 mysqld — The MySQL Server"). Dependencies are encoded in an
`ANONYMOUS_GTID` event using a scheme called
'Logical clock'. (See
[Section 19.1.4.1, “Replication Mode Concepts”](replication-mode-change-online-concepts.md "19.1.4.1 Replication Mode Concepts").)

The writeset implementation employed by MySQL (and NDB Cluster)
uses hash-based conflict detection based on matching 64-bit row
hashes of relevant table and index values. This detects reliably
when the same key is seen twice, but can also produce false
positives if different table and index values hash to the same
64-bit value; this may result in artificial dependencies which can
reduce the available parallelism.

Transaction dependencies are forced by any of the following:

- DDL statements
- Binary log rotation or encountering binary log file boundaries
- Writeset history size limitations
- Writes which reference parent foreign keys in the target table

  More specifically, transactions which perform inserts,
  updates, and deletes on foreign key
  *parent* tables are serialized relative to
  all preceding and following transactions, and not just to
  those transactions affecting tables involved in a constraint
  relationship. Conversely, transactions performing inserts,
  updates and deletes on foreign key *child*
  tables (referencing) are not especially serialized with regard
  to one another.

The MySQL MTA implementation attempts to apply independent binary
log transactions in parallel. `NDB` records all
changes occurring in all user transactions committing in an epoch
([`TimeBetweenEpochs`](mysql-cluster-ndbd-definition.md#ndbparam-ndbd-timebetweenepochs),
default 100 milliseconds), in one binary log transaction, referred
to as an epoch transaction. Therefore, for two consecutive epoch
transactions to be independent, and possible to apply in parallel,
it is required that no row is modified in both epochs. If any
single row is modified in both epochs, then they are dependent,
and are applied serially, which can limit the expolitable
parallelism available.

Epoch transactions are considered independent based on the set of
rows modified on the source cluster in the epoch, but not
including the generated `mysql.ndb_apply_status`
`WRITE_ROW` events that convey epoch metadata.
This avoids every epoch transaction being trivially dependent on
the preceding epoch, but does require that the binlog is applied
at the replica with the commit order preserved. This also implies
that an NDB binary log with writeset dependencies is not suitable
for use by a replica database using a different MySQL storage
engine.

It may be possible or desirable to modify application transaction
behavior to avoid patterns of repeated modifications to the same
rows, in separate transactions over a short time period, to
increase exploitable apply parallelism.

#### Writeset Tracking Memory Usage

The amount of memory used to track binary log transaction
writesets can be set using the
[`binlog_transaction_dependency_history_size`](replication-options-binary-log.md#sysvar_binlog_transaction_dependency_history_size)
server system variable, which defaults to 25000 row hashes.

If an average binary log transaction modifies
*`N`* rows, then to be able to identify
independent (parallelizable) transactions up to a parallelism
level of *`P`*, we need
`binlog_transaction_dependency_history_size` to
be at least `N *
P`. (The maximum is 1000000.)

The finite size of the history results in a finite maximum
dependency length that can be reliably determined, giving a finite
parallelism that can be expressed. Any row not found in the
history may be dependent on the last transaction purged from the
history.

Writeset history does not act like a sliding window over the last
*`N`* transactions; rather, it is a finite
buffer which is allowed to fill up completely, then its contents
entirely discarded when it becomes full. This means that the
history size follows a sawtooth pattern over time, and therefore
the maximum detectable dependency length also follows a sawtooth
pattern over time, such that independent transactions may still be
marked as dependent if the writeset history buffer has been reset
between their being processed.

In this scheme, each transaction in a binary log file is annotated
with a `sequence_number` (1, 2, 3, ...), and as
well as the sequence number of the most recent binary log
transaction that it depends on, to which we refer as
`last_committed`.

Within a given binary log file, the first transaction has
`sequence_number` 1 and
`last_committed` 0.

Where a binary log transaction depends on its immediate
predecessor, its application is serialized. If the dependency is
on an earlier transaction then it may be possible to apply the
transaction in parallel with the preceding independent
transactions.

The content of `ANONYMOUS_GTID` events, including
`sequence_number` and
`last_committed` (and thus the transaction
dependencies), can be seen using [**mysqlbinlog**](mysqlbinlog.md "6.6.9 mysqlbinlog — Utility for Processing Binary Log Files").

The `ANONYMOUS_GTID` events generated on the
source are handled separately from the compressed transaction
payload with bulk `BEGIN`,
`TABLE_MAP*`, `WRITE_ROW*`,
`UPDATE_ROW*`, `DELETE_ROW*`,
and `COMMIT` events, allowing dependencies to be
determined prior to decompression. This means that the replica
coordinator thread can delegate transaction payload decompression
to a worker thread, providing automatic parallel decompression of
independent transactions on the replica.

#### Known Limitations

**Secondary unique columns.**
Tables with secondary unique columns (that is, unique keys other
than the primary key) have all columns sent to the source so
that unique-key related conflicts can be detected.

Where the current binary logging mode does not include all
columns, but only changed columns
([`--ndb-log-updated-only=OFF`](mysql-cluster-options-variables.md#option_mysqld_ndb-log-updated-only),
[`--ndb-log-update-minimal=ON`](mysql-cluster-options-variables.md#option_mysqld_ndb-log-update-minimal),
[`--ndb-log-update-as-write=OFF`](mysql-cluster-options-variables.md#option_mysqld_ndb-log-update-as-write)),
this can increase the volume of data sent from data nodes to SQL
nodes.

The impact depends on both the rate of modification (update or
delete) of rows in such tables and the volume of data in columns
which are not actually modified.

**Replicating NDB to InnoDB.**
`NDB` binary log injector transaction
dependency tracking intentionally ignores the inter-transaction
dependencies created by generated
`mysql.ndb_apply_status` metadata events, which
are handled separately as part of the commit of the epoch
transaction on the replica applier. For replication to
[`InnoDB`](innodb-storage-engine.md "Chapter 17 The InnoDB Storage Engine"), there is no special
handling; this may result in reduced performance or other issues
when using an `InnoDB` multithreaded applier to
consume an `NDB` MTA binary log.
