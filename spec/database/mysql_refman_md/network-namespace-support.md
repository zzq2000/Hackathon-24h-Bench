### 7.1.14 Network Namespace Support

A network namespace is a logical copy of the network stack from
the host system. Network namespaces are useful for setting up
containers or virtual environments. Each namespace has its own IP
addresses, network interfaces, routing tables, and so forth. The
default or global namespace is the one in which the host system
physical interfaces exist.

Namespace-specific address spaces can lead to problems when MySQL
connections cross namespaces. For example, the network address
space for a MySQL instance running in a container or virtual
network may differ from the address space of the host machine.
This can produce phenomena such as a client connection from an
address in one namespace appearing to the MySQL server to be
coming from a different address, even for client and server
running on the same machine. Suppose that both processes run on a
host with IP address `203.0.113.10` but use
different namespaces. A connection may produce a result like this:

```simple
$> mysql --user=admin --host=203.0.113.10 --protocol=tcp

mysql> SELECT USER();
+--------------------+
| USER()             |
+--------------------+
| admin@198.51.100.2 |
+--------------------+
```

In this case, the expected [`USER()`](information-functions.md#function_user)
value is `admin@203.0.113.10`. Such behavior can
make it difficult to assign account permissions properly if the
address from which an connection originates is not what it
appears.

To address this issue, MySQL enables specifying the network
namespace to use for TCP/IP connections, so that both endpoints of
connections use an agreed-upon common address space.

MySQL 8.0.22 and higher supports network namespaces on platforms
that implement them. Support within MySQL applies to:

- The MySQL server, [**mysqld**](mysqld.md "6.3.1 mysqld — The MySQL Server").
- X Plugin.
- The [**mysql**](mysql.md "6.5.1 mysql — The MySQL Command-Line Client") client and the
  **mysqlxtest** test suite client. (Other
  clients are not supported. They must be invoked from within
  the network namespace of the server to which they are to
  connect.)
- Regular replication.
- Group Replication, only when using the MySQL communication
  stack to establish group communication connections (from MySQL
  8.0.27).

The following sections describe how to use network namespaces in
MySQL:

- [Host System Prerequisites](network-namespace-support.md#network-namespaces-host-prerequisites "Host System Prerequisites")
- [MySQL Configuration](network-namespace-support.md#network-namespaces-mysql-configuration "MySQL Configuration")
- [Network Namespace Monitoring](network-namespace-support.md#network-namespaces-monitoring "Network Namespace Monitoring")

#### Host System Prerequisites

Prior to using network namespace support in MySQL, these host
system prerequisites must be satisfied:

- The host operating system must support network namespaces.
  (For example, Linux.)
- Any network namespace to be used by MySQL must first be
  created on the host system.
- Host name resolution must be configured by the system
  administrator to support network namespaces.

  Note

  A known limitation is that, within MySQL, host name
  resolution does not work for names specified in network
  namespace-specific host files. For example, if the address
  for a host name in the `red` namespace is
  specified in the `/etc/netns/red/hosts`
  file, binding to the name fails on both the server and
  client sides. The workaround is to use the IP address
  rather than the host name.
- The system administrator must enable the
  `CAP_SYS_ADMIN` operating system privilege
  for the MySQL binaries that support network namespaces
  ([**mysqld**](mysqld.md "6.3.1 mysqld — The MySQL Server"), [**mysql**](mysql.md "6.5.1 mysql — The MySQL Command-Line Client"),
  **mysqlxtest**).

  Important

  Enabling `CAP_SYS_ADMIN` is a security
  sensitive operation because it enables a process to
  perform other privileged actions in addition to setting
  namespaces. For a description of its effects, see
  <https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man7/capabilities.7.html>.

  Because `CAP_SYS_ADMIN` must be enabled
  explicitly by the system administrator, MySQL binaries by
  default do not have network namespace support enabled. The
  system administrator should evaluate the security
  implications of running MySQL processes with
  `CAP_SYS_ADMIN` before enabling it.

The instructions in the following example set up network
namespaces named `red` and
`blue`. The names you choose may differ, as may
the network addresses and interfaces on your host system.

Invoke the commands shown here either as the
`root` operating system user or by prefixing
each command with **sudo**. For example, to
invoke the **ip** or **setcap**
command if you are not `root`, use
**sudo ip** or **sudo setcap**.

To configure network namespaces, use the **ip**
command. For some operations, the **ip** command
must execute within a particular namespace (which must already
exist). In such cases, begin the command like this:

```terminal
ip netns exec namespace_name
```

For example, this command executes within the
`red` namespace to bring up the loopback
interface:

```terminal
ip netns exec red ip link set lo up
```

To add namespaces named `red` and
`blue`, each with its own virtual Ethernet
device used as a link between namespaces and its own loopback
interface:

```terminal
ip netns add red
ip link add veth-red type veth peer name vpeer-red
ip link set vpeer-red netns red
ip addr add 192.0.2.1/24 dev veth-red
ip link set veth-red up
ip netns exec red ip addr add 192.0.2.2/24 dev vpeer-red
ip netns exec red ip link set vpeer-red up
ip netns exec red ip link set lo up

ip netns add blue
ip link add veth-blue type veth peer name vpeer-blue
ip link set vpeer-blue netns blue
ip addr add 198.51.100.1/24 dev veth-blue
ip link set veth-blue up
ip netns exec blue ip addr add 198.51.100.2/24 dev vpeer-blue
ip netns exec blue ip link set vpeer-blue up
ip netns exec blue ip link set lo up

# if you want to enable inter-subnet routing...
sysctl net.ipv4.ip_forward=1
ip netns exec red ip route add default via 192.0.2.1
ip netns exec blue ip route add default via 198.51.100.1
```

A diagram of the links between namespaces looks like this:

```none
red              global           blue

192.0.2.2   <=>  192.0.2.1
(vpeer-red)      (veth-red)

                 198.51.100.1 <=> 198.51.100.2
                 (veth-blue)      (vpeer-blue)
```

To check which namespaces and links exist:

```terminal
ip netns list
ip link list
```

To see the routing tables for the global and named namespaces:

```terminal
ip route show
ip netns exec red ip route show
ip netns exec blue ip route show
```

To remove the `red` and `blue`
links and namespaces:

```terminal
ip link del veth-red
ip link del veth-blue

ip netns del red
ip netns del blue

sysctl net.ipv4.ip_forward=0
```

So that the MySQL binaries that include network namespace
support can actually use namespaces, you must grant them the
`CAP_SYS_ADMIN` capability. The following
**setcap** commands assume that you have changed
location to the directory containing your MySQL binaries (adjust
the pathname for your system as necessary):

```terminal
cd /usr/local/mysql/bin
```

To grant `CAP_SYS_ADMIN` capability to the
appropriate binaries:

```terminal
setcap cap_sys_admin+ep ./mysqld
setcap cap_sys_admin+ep ./mysql
setcap cap_sys_admin+ep ./mysqlxtest
```

To check `CAP_SYS_ADMIN` capability:

```terminal
$> getcap ./mysqld ./mysql ./mysqlxtest
./mysqld = cap_sys_admin+ep
./mysql = cap_sys_admin+ep
./mysqlxtest = cap_sys_admin+ep
```

To remove `CAP_SYS_ADMIN` capability:

```terminal
setcap -r ./mysqld
setcap -r ./mysql
setcap -r ./mysqlxtest
```

Important

If you reinstall binaries to which you have previously applied
**setcap**, you must use
**setcap** again. For example, if you perform
an in-place MySQL upgrade, failure to grant the
`CAP_SYS_ADMIN` capability again results in
namespace-related failures. The server fails with this error
for attempts to bind to an address with a named namespace:

```none
[ERROR] [MY-013408] [Server] setns() failed with error 'Operation not permitted'
```

A client invoked with the
[`--network-namespace`](mysql-command-options.md#option_mysql_network-namespace) option fails
like this:

```none
ERROR: Network namespace error: Operation not permitted
```

#### MySQL Configuration

Assuming that the preceding host system prerequisites have been
satisfied, MySQL enables configuring the server-side namespace
for the listening (inbound) side of connections and the
client-side namespace for the outbound side of connections.

On the server side, the
[`bind_address`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_bind_address),
[`admin_address`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_admin_address), and
[`mysqlx_bind_address`](x-plugin-options-system-variables.md#sysvar_mysqlx_bind_address) system
variables have extended syntax for specifying the network
namespace to use for a given IP address or host name on which to
listen for incoming connections. To specify a namespace for an
address, add a slash and the namespace name. For example, a
server `my.cnf` file might contain these
lines:

```ini
[mysqld]
bind_address = 127.0.1.1,192.0.2.2/red,198.51.100.2/blue
admin_address = 102.0.2.2/red
mysqlx_bind_address = 102.0.2.2/red
```

These rules apply:

- A network namespace can be specified for an IP address or a
  host name.
- A network namespace cannot be specified for a wildcard IP
  address.
- For a given address, the network namespace is optional. If
  given, it must be specified as a
  `/ns` suffix
  immediately following the address.
- An address with no
  `/ns` suffix
  uses the host system global namespace. The global namespace
  is therefore the default.
- An address with a
  `/ns` suffix
  uses the namespace named *`ns`*.
- The host system must support network namespaces and each
  named namespace must previously have been set up. Naming a
  nonexistent namespace produces an error.
- [`bind_address`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_bind_address) and (as of
  MySQL 8.0.21)
  [`mysqlx_bind_address`](x-plugin-options-system-variables.md#sysvar_mysqlx_bind_address) accept
  a list of multiple comma-separated addresses, the variable
  value can specify addresses in the global namespace, in
  named namespaces, or a mix.

If an error occurs during server startup for attempts to use a
namespace, the server does not start. If errors occur for
X Plugin during plugin initialization such that it is unable to
bind to any address, the plugin fails its initialization
sequence and the server does not load it.

On the client side, a network namespace can be specified in
these contexts:

- For the [**mysql**](mysql.md "6.5.1 mysql — The MySQL Command-Line Client") client and the
  **mysqlxtest** test suite client, use the
  [`--network-namespace`](mysql-command-options.md#option_mysql_network-namespace) option.
  For example:

  ```terminal
  mysql --host=192.0.2.2 --network-namespace=red
  ```

  If the [`--network-namespace`](mysql-command-options.md#option_mysql_network-namespace)
  option is omitted, the connection uses the default (global)
  namespace.
- For replication connections from replica servers to source
  servers, use the [`CHANGE REPLICATION
  SOURCE TO`](change-replication-source-to.md "15.4.2.3 CHANGE REPLICATION SOURCE TO Statement") statement (from MySQL 8.0.23) or
  [`CHANGE MASTER TO`](change-master-to.md "15.4.2.1 CHANGE MASTER TO Statement") statement
  (before MySQL 8.0.23) and specify the
  `NETWORK_NAMESPACE` option. For example:

  ```sql
  CHANGE REPLICATION SOURCE TO
    SOURCE_HOST = '192.0.2.2',
    NETWORK_NAMESPACE = 'red';
  ```

  If the `NETWORK_NAMESPACE` option is
  omitted, replication connections use the default (global)
  namespace.

The following example sets up a MySQL server that listens for
connections in the global, `red`, and
`blue` namespaces, and shows how to configure
accounts that connect from the `red` and
`blue` namespaces. It is assumed that the
`red` and `blue` namespaces
have already been created as shown in
[Host System Prerequisites](network-namespace-support.md#network-namespaces-host-prerequisites "Host System Prerequisites").

1. Configure the server to listen on addresses in multiple
   namespaces. Put these lines in the server
   `my.cnf` file and start the server:

   ```ini
   [mysqld]
   bind_address = 127.0.1.1,192.0.2.2/red,198.51.100.2/blue
   ```

   The value tells the server to listen on the loopback address
   `127.0.0.1` in the global namespace, the
   address `192.0.2.2` in the
   `red` namespace, and the address
   `198.51.100.2` in the
   `blue` namespace.
2. Connect to the server in the global namespace and create
   accounts that have permission to connect from an address in
   the address space of each named namespace:

   ```terminal
   $> mysql -u root -h 127.0.0.1 -p
   Enter password: root_password

   mysql> CREATE USER 'red_user'@'192.0.2.2'
          IDENTIFIED BY 'red_user_password';
   mysql> CREATE USER 'blue_user'@'198.51.100.2'
          IDENTIFIED BY 'blue_user_password';
   ```
3. Verify that you can connect to the server in each named
   namespace:

   ```terminal
   $> mysql -u red_user -h 192.0.2.2 --network-namespace=red -p
   Enter password: red_user_password

   mysql> SELECT USER();
   +--------------------+
   | USER()             |
   +--------------------+
   | red_user@192.0.2.2 |
   +--------------------+
   ```

   ```terminal
   $> mysql -u blue_user -h 198.51.100.2 --network-namespace=blue -p
   Enter password: blue_user_password

   mysql> SELECT USER();
   +------------------------+
   | USER()                 |
   +------------------------+
   | blue_user@198.51.100.2 |
   +------------------------+
   ```

   Note

   You might see different results from
   [`USER()`](information-functions.md#function_user), which can return a
   value that includes a host name rather than an IP address
   if your DNS is configured to be able to resolve the
   address to the corresponding host name and the server is
   not run with the
   [`skip_name_resolve`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_skip_name_resolve) system
   variable enabled.

   You might also try invoking [**mysql**](mysql.md "6.5.1 mysql — The MySQL Command-Line Client") without
   the [`--network-namespace`](mysql-command-options.md#option_mysql_network-namespace) option
   to see whether the connection attempt succeeds, and, if so,
   how the [`USER()`](information-functions.md#function_user) value is
   affected.

#### Network Namespace Monitoring

For replication monitoring purposes, these information sources
have a column that displays the applicable network namespace for
connections:

- The Performance Schema
  `replication_connection_configuration`
  table. See
  [Section 29.12.11.10, “The replication\_connection\_configuration Table”](performance-schema-replication-connection-configuration-table.md "29.12.11.10 The replication_connection_configuration Table").
- The replica server connection metadata repository. See
  [Section 19.2.4.2, “Replication Metadata Repositories”](replica-logs-status.md "19.2.4.2 Replication Metadata Repositories").
- The
  [`SHOW
  REPLICA STATUS`](show-replica-status.md "15.7.7.35 SHOW REPLICA STATUS Statement") (or before MySQL 8.0.22,
  [`SHOW
  SLAVE STATUS`](show-slave-status.md "15.7.7.36 SHOW SLAVE | REPLICA STATUS Statement")) statement. See
  [Section 15.7.7.35, “SHOW REPLICA STATUS Statement”](show-replica-status.md "15.7.7.35 SHOW REPLICA STATUS Statement").
