### 10.3.5 Column Indexes

The most common type of index involves a single column, storing
copies of the values from that column in a data structure,
allowing fast lookups for the rows with the corresponding column
values. The B-tree data structure lets the index quickly find a
specific value, a set of values, or a range of values,
corresponding to operators such as `=`,
`>`, `≤`,
`BETWEEN`, `IN`, and so on, in
a `WHERE` clause.

The maximum number of indexes per table and the maximum index
length is defined per storage engine. See
[Chapter 17, *The InnoDB Storage Engine*](innodb-storage-engine.md "Chapter 17 The InnoDB Storage Engine"), and
[Chapter 18, *Alternative Storage Engines*](storage-engines.md "Chapter 18 Alternative Storage Engines"). All storage engines support
at least 16 indexes per table and a total index length of at
least 256 bytes. Most storage engines have higher limits.

For additional information about column indexes, see
[Section 15.1.15, “CREATE INDEX Statement”](create-index.md "15.1.15 CREATE INDEX Statement").

#### Index Prefixes

With
`col_name(N)`
syntax in an index specification for a string column, you can
create an index that uses only the first
*`N`* characters of the column.
Indexing only a prefix of column values in this way can make
the index file much smaller. When you index a
[`BLOB`](blob.md "13.3.4 The BLOB and TEXT Types") or
[`TEXT`](blob.md "13.3.4 The BLOB and TEXT Types") column, you
*must* specify a prefix length for the
index. For example:

```sql
CREATE TABLE test (blob_col BLOB, INDEX(blob_col(10)));
```

Prefixes can be up to 767 bytes long for
`InnoDB` tables that use the
`REDUNDANT`
or
`COMPACT`
row format. The prefix length limit is 3072 bytes for
`InnoDB` tables that use the
`DYNAMIC`
or
`COMPRESSED`
row format. For MyISAM tables, the prefix length limit is 1000
bytes.

Note

Prefix limits are measured in bytes, whereas the prefix
length in [`CREATE TABLE`](create-table.md "15.1.20 CREATE TABLE Statement"),
[`ALTER TABLE`](alter-table.md "15.1.9 ALTER TABLE Statement"), and
[`CREATE INDEX`](create-index.md "15.1.15 CREATE INDEX Statement") statements is
interpreted as number of characters for nonbinary string
types ([`CHAR`](char.md "13.3.2 The CHAR and VARCHAR Types"),
[`VARCHAR`](char.md "13.3.2 The CHAR and VARCHAR Types"),
[`TEXT`](blob.md "13.3.4 The BLOB and TEXT Types")) and number of bytes for
binary string types ([`BINARY`](binary-varbinary.md "13.3.3 The BINARY and VARBINARY Types"),
[`VARBINARY`](binary-varbinary.md "13.3.3 The BINARY and VARBINARY Types"),
[`BLOB`](blob.md "13.3.4 The BLOB and TEXT Types")). Take this into account
when specifying a prefix length for a nonbinary string
column that uses a multibyte character set.

If a search term exceeds the index prefix length, the index is
used to exclude non-matching rows, and the remaining rows are
examined for possible matches.

For additional information about index prefixes, see
[Section 15.1.15, “CREATE INDEX Statement”](create-index.md "15.1.15 CREATE INDEX Statement").

#### FULLTEXT Indexes

`FULLTEXT` indexes are used for full-text
searches. Only the [`InnoDB`](innodb-storage-engine.md "Chapter 17 The InnoDB Storage Engine") and
[`MyISAM`](myisam-storage-engine.md "18.2 The MyISAM Storage Engine") storage engines support
`FULLTEXT` indexes and only for
[`CHAR`](char.md "13.3.2 The CHAR and VARCHAR Types"),
[`VARCHAR`](char.md "13.3.2 The CHAR and VARCHAR Types"), and
[`TEXT`](blob.md "13.3.4 The BLOB and TEXT Types") columns. Indexing always
takes place over the entire column and column prefix indexing
is not supported. For details, see
[Section 14.9, “Full-Text Search Functions”](fulltext-search.md "14.9 Full-Text Search Functions").

Optimizations are applied to certain kinds of
`FULLTEXT` queries against single
`InnoDB` tables. Queries with these
characteristics are particularly efficient:

- `FULLTEXT` queries that only return the
  document ID, or the document ID and the search rank.
- `FULLTEXT` queries that sort the matching
  rows in descending order of score and apply a
  `LIMIT` clause to take the top N matching
  rows. For this optimization to apply, there must be no
  `WHERE` clauses and only a single
  `ORDER BY` clause in descending order.
- `FULLTEXT` queries that retrieve only the
  `COUNT(*)` value of rows matching a
  search term, with no additional `WHERE`
  clauses. Code the `WHERE` clause as
  `WHERE MATCH(text)
  AGAINST
  ('other_text')`,
  without any `> 0` comparison operator.

For queries that contain full-text expressions, MySQL
evaluates those expressions during the optimization phase of
query execution. The optimizer does not just look at full-text
expressions and make estimates, it actually evaluates them in
the process of developing an execution plan.

An implication of this behavior is that
[`EXPLAIN`](explain.md "15.8.2 EXPLAIN Statement") for full-text queries
is typically slower than for non-full-text queries for which
no expression evaluation occurs during the optimization phase.

[`EXPLAIN`](explain.md "15.8.2 EXPLAIN Statement") for full-text queries
may show `Select tables optimized away` in
the `Extra` column due to matching occurring
during optimization; in this case, no table access need occur
during later execution.

#### Spatial Indexes

You can create indexes on spatial data types.
`MyISAM` and `InnoDB`
support R-tree indexes on spatial types. Other storage engines
use B-trees for indexing spatial types (except for
`ARCHIVE`, which does not support spatial
type indexing).

#### Indexes in the MEMORY Storage Engine

The `MEMORY` storage engine uses
`HASH` indexes by default, but also supports
`BTREE` indexes.
