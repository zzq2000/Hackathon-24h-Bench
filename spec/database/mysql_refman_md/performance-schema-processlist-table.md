#### 29.12.21.7 The processlist Table

The MySQL process list indicates the operations currently
being performed by the set of threads executing within the
server. The [`processlist`](performance-schema-processlist-table.md "29.12.21.7 The processlist Table") table is
one source of process information. For a comparison of this
table with other sources, see
[Sources of Process Information](processlist-access.md#processlist-sources "Sources of Process Information").

The [`processlist`](performance-schema-processlist-table.md "29.12.21.7 The processlist Table") table can be
queried directly. If you have the
[`PROCESS`](privileges-provided.md#priv_process) privilege, you can see
all threads, even those belonging to other users. Otherwise
(without the [`PROCESS`](privileges-provided.md#priv_process)
privilege), nonanonymous users have access to information
about their own threads but not threads for other users, and
anonymous users have no access to thread information.

Note

If the
[`performance_schema_show_processlist`](performance-schema-system-variables.md#sysvar_performance_schema_show_processlist)
system variable is enabled, the
[`processlist`](performance-schema-processlist-table.md "29.12.21.7 The processlist Table") table also serves
as the basis for an alternative implementation underlying
the [`SHOW PROCESSLIST`](show-processlist.md "15.7.7.29 SHOW PROCESSLIST Statement")
statement. For details, see later in this section.

The [`processlist`](performance-schema-processlist-table.md "29.12.21.7 The processlist Table") table contains a
row for each server process:

```sql
mysql> SELECT * FROM performance_schema.processlist\G
*************************** 1. row ***************************
     ID: 5
   USER: event_scheduler
   HOST: localhost
     DB: NULL
COMMAND: Daemon
   TIME: 137
  STATE: Waiting on empty queue
   INFO: NULL
*************************** 2. row ***************************
     ID: 9
   USER: me
   HOST: localhost:58812
     DB: NULL
COMMAND: Sleep
   TIME: 95
  STATE:
   INFO: NULL
*************************** 3. row ***************************
     ID: 10
   USER: me
   HOST: localhost:58834
     DB: test
COMMAND: Query
   TIME: 0
  STATE: executing
   INFO: SELECT * FROM performance_schema.processlist
...
```

The [`processlist`](performance-schema-processlist-table.md "29.12.21.7 The processlist Table") table has these
columns:

- `ID`

  The connection identifier. This is the same value
  displayed in the `Id` column of the
  [`SHOW PROCESSLIST`](show-processlist.md "15.7.7.29 SHOW PROCESSLIST Statement") statement,
  displayed in the `PROCESSLIST_ID` column
  of the Performance Schema
  [`threads`](performance-schema-threads-table.md "29.12.21.8 The threads Table") table, and returned
  by the [`CONNECTION_ID()`](information-functions.md#function_connection-id)
  function within the thread.
- `USER`

  The MySQL user who issued the statement. A value of
  `system user` refers to a nonclient
  thread spawned by the server to handle tasks internally,
  for example, a delayed-row handler thread or an I/O or SQL
  thread used on replica hosts. For `system
  user`, there is no host specified in the
  `Host` column. `unauthenticated
  user` refers to a thread that has become
  associated with a client connection but for which
  authentication of the client user has not yet occurred.
  `event_scheduler` refers to the thread
  that monitors scheduled events (see
  [Section 27.4, “Using the Event Scheduler”](event-scheduler.md "27.4 Using the Event Scheduler")).

  Note

  A `USER` value of `system
  user` is distinct from the
  [`SYSTEM_USER`](privileges-provided.md#priv_system-user) privilege.
  The former designates internal threads. The latter
  distinguishes the system user and regular user account
  categories (see [Section 8.2.11, “Account Categories”](account-categories.md "8.2.11 Account Categories")).
- `HOST`

  The host name of the client issuing the statement (except
  for `system user`, for which there is no
  host). The host name for TCP/IP connections is reported in
  `host_name:client_port`
  format to make it easier to determine which client is
  doing what.
- `DB`

  The default database for the thread, or
  `NULL` if none has been selected.
- `COMMAND`

  The type of command the thread is executing on behalf of
  the client, or `Sleep` if the session is
  idle. For descriptions of thread commands, see
  [Section 10.14, “Examining Server Thread (Process) Information”](thread-information.md "10.14 Examining Server Thread (Process) Information"). The value of this
  column corresponds to the
  `COM_xxx`
  commands of the client/server protocol and
  `Com_xxx`
  status variables. See
  [Section 7.1.10, “Server Status Variables”](server-status-variables.md "7.1.10 Server Status Variables")
- `TIME`

  The time in seconds that the thread has been in its
  current state. For a replica SQL thread, the value is the
  number of seconds between the timestamp of the last
  replicated event and the real time of the replica host.
  See [Section 19.2.3, “Replication Threads”](replication-threads.md "19.2.3 Replication Threads").
- `STATE`

  An action, event, or state that indicates what the thread
  is doing. For descriptions of `STATE`
  values, see [Section 10.14, “Examining Server Thread (Process) Information”](thread-information.md "10.14 Examining Server Thread (Process) Information").

  Most states correspond to very quick operations. If a
  thread stays in a given state for many seconds, there
  might be a problem that needs to be investigated.
- `INFO`

  The statement the thread is executing, or
  `NULL` if it is executing no statement.
  The statement might be the one sent to the server, or an
  innermost statement if the statement executes other
  statements. For example, if a `CALL`
  statement executes a stored procedure that is executing a
  [`SELECT`](select.md "15.2.13 SELECT Statement") statement, the
  `INFO` value shows the
  [`SELECT`](select.md "15.2.13 SELECT Statement") statement.
- `EXECUTION_ENGINE`

  The query execution engine. The value is either
  `PRIMARY` or
  `SECONDARY`. For use with MySQL HeatWave Service and
  MySQL HeatWave, where the `PRIMARY` engine is
  `InnoDB` and the
  `SECONDARY` engine is MySQL HeatWave
  (`RAPID`). For MySQL Community Edition Server, MySQL Enterprise Edition Server
  (on-premise), and MySQL HeatWave Service without MySQL HeatWave, the value is
  always `PRIMARY`. This column was added
  in MySQL 8.0.29.

The [`processlist`](performance-schema-processlist-table.md "29.12.21.7 The processlist Table") table has these
indexes:

- Primary key on (`ID`)

[`TRUNCATE TABLE`](truncate-table.md "15.1.37 TRUNCATE TABLE Statement") is not permitted
for the [`processlist`](performance-schema-processlist-table.md "29.12.21.7 The processlist Table") table.

As mentioned previously, if the
[`performance_schema_show_processlist`](performance-schema-system-variables.md#sysvar_performance_schema_show_processlist)
system variable is enabled, the
[`processlist`](performance-schema-processlist-table.md "29.12.21.7 The processlist Table") table serves as the
basis for an alternative implementation of other process
information sources:

- The [`SHOW PROCESSLIST`](show-processlist.md "15.7.7.29 SHOW PROCESSLIST Statement")
  statement.
- The [**mysqladmin processlist**](mysqladmin.md "6.5.2 mysqladmin — A MySQL Server Administration Program") command
  (which uses [`SHOW
  PROCESSLIST`](show-processlist.md "15.7.7.29 SHOW PROCESSLIST Statement") statement).

The default [`SHOW PROCESSLIST`](show-processlist.md "15.7.7.29 SHOW PROCESSLIST Statement")
implementation iterates across active threads from within the
thread manager while holding a global mutex. This has negative
performance consequences, particularly on busy systems. The
alternative [`SHOW PROCESSLIST`](show-processlist.md "15.7.7.29 SHOW PROCESSLIST Statement")
implementation is based on the Performance Schema
[`processlist`](performance-schema-processlist-table.md "29.12.21.7 The processlist Table") table. This
implementation queries active thread data from the Performance
Schema rather than the thread manager and does not require a
mutex.

MySQL configuration affects
[`processlist`](performance-schema-processlist-table.md "29.12.21.7 The processlist Table") table contents as
follows:

- Minimum required configuration:

  - The MySQL server must be configured and built with
    thread instrumentation enabled. This is true by
    default; it is controlled using the
    [`DISABLE_PSI_THREAD`](source-configuration-options.md#option_cmake_disable_psi_thread)
    **CMake** option.
  - The Performance Schema must be enabled at server
    startup. This is true by default; it is controlled
    using the
    [`performance_schema`](performance-schema-system-variables.md#sysvar_performance_schema)
    system variable.

  With that configuration satisfied,
  [`performance_schema_show_processlist`](performance-schema-system-variables.md#sysvar_performance_schema_show_processlist)
  enables or disables the alternative
  [`SHOW PROCESSLIST`](show-processlist.md "15.7.7.29 SHOW PROCESSLIST Statement")
  implementation. If the minimum configuration is not
  satisfied, the [`processlist`](performance-schema-processlist-table.md "29.12.21.7 The processlist Table")
  table (and thus [`SHOW
  PROCESSLIST`](show-processlist.md "15.7.7.29 SHOW PROCESSLIST Statement")) may not return all data.
- Recommended configuration:

  - To avoid having some threads ignored:

    - Leave the
      [`performance_schema_max_thread_instances`](performance-schema-system-variables.md#sysvar_performance_schema_max_thread_instances)
      system variable set to its default or set it at
      least as great as the
      [`max_connections`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_max_connections)
      system variable.
    - Leave the
      [`performance_schema_max_thread_classes`](performance-schema-system-variables.md#sysvar_performance_schema_max_thread_classes)
      system variable set to its default.
  - To avoid having some `STATE` column
    values be empty, leave the
    [`performance_schema_max_stage_classes`](performance-schema-system-variables.md#sysvar_performance_schema_max_stage_classes)
    system variable set to its default.

  The default for those configuration parameters is
  `-1`, which causes the Performance Schema
  to autosize them at server startup. With the parameters
  set as indicated, the
  [`processlist`](performance-schema-processlist-table.md "29.12.21.7 The processlist Table") table (and thus
  [`SHOW PROCESSLIST`](show-processlist.md "15.7.7.29 SHOW PROCESSLIST Statement")) produce
  complete process information.

The preceding configuration parameters affect the contents of
the `processlist` table. For a given
configuration, however, the
[`processlist`](performance-schema-processlist-table.md "29.12.21.7 The processlist Table") contents are
unaffected by the
[`performance_schema_show_processlist`](performance-schema-system-variables.md#sysvar_performance_schema_show_processlist)
setting.

The alternative process list implementation does not apply to
the `INFORMATION_SCHEMA`
[`PROCESSLIST`](information-schema-processlist-table.md "28.3.23 The INFORMATION_SCHEMA PROCESSLIST Table") table or the
`COM_PROCESS_INFO` command of the MySQL
client/server protocol.
