[1.6.3 How MySQL Deals with Constraints](constraints.md)

This section describes how MySQL relates to the ANSI/ISO SQL
standards. MySQL Server has many extensions to the SQL standard,
and here you can find out what they are and how to use them. You
can also find information about functionality missing from MySQL
Server, and how to work around some of the differences.

The SQL standard has been evolving since 1986 and several versions
exist. In this manual, “SQL-92” refers to the
standard released in 1992. “SQL:1999”,
“SQL:2003”, “SQL:2008”, and
“SQL:2011” refer to the versions of the standard
released in the corresponding years, with the last being the most
recent version. We use the phrase “the SQL standard”
or “standard SQL” to mean the current version of the
SQL Standard at any time.

One of our main goals with the product is to continue to work
toward compliance with the SQL standard, but without sacrificing
speed or reliability. We are not afraid to add extensions to SQL
or support for non-SQL features if this greatly increases the
usability of MySQL Server for a large segment of our user base.
The [`HANDLER`](handler.md "15.2.5 HANDLER Statement") interface is an example
of this strategy. See [Section 15.2.5, “HANDLER Statement”](handler.md "15.2.5 HANDLER Statement").

We continue to support transactional and nontransactional
databases to satisfy both mission-critical 24/7 usage and heavy
Web or logging usage.

MySQL Server was originally designed to work with medium-sized
databases (10-100 million rows, or about 100MB per table) on small
computer systems. Today MySQL Server handles terabyte-sized
databases.

We are not targeting real-time support, although MySQL replication
capabilities offer significant functionality.

MySQL supports ODBC levels 0 to 3.51.

MySQL supports high-availability database clustering using the
[`NDBCLUSTER`](mysql-cluster.md "Chapter 25 MySQL NDB Cluster 8.0") storage engine. See
[Chapter 25, *MySQL NDB Cluster 8.0*](mysql-cluster.md "Chapter 25 MySQL NDB Cluster 8.0").

We implement XML functionality which supports most of the W3C
XPath standard. See [Section 14.11, “XML Functions”](xml-functions.md "14.11 XML Functions").

MySQL supports a native JSON data type as defined by RFC 7159, and
based on the ECMAScript standard (ECMA-262). See
[Section 13.5, “The JSON Data Type”](json.md "13.5 The JSON Data Type"). MySQL also implements a subset of the
SQL/JSON functions specified by a pre-publication draft of the
SQL:2016 standard; see [Section 14.17, “JSON Functions”](json-functions.md "14.17 JSON Functions"), for more
information.

### Selecting SQL Modes

The MySQL server can operate in different SQL modes, and can apply
these modes differently for different clients, depending on the
value of the [`sql_mode`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_sql_mode) system
variable. DBAs can set the global SQL mode to match site server
operating requirements, and each application can set its session
SQL mode to its own requirements.

Modes affect the SQL syntax MySQL supports and the data validation
checks it performs. This makes it easier to use MySQL in different
environments and to use MySQL together with other database
servers.

For more information on setting the SQL mode, see
[Section 7.1.11, “Server SQL Modes”](sql-mode.md "7.1.11 Server SQL Modes").

### Running MySQL in ANSI Mode

To run MySQL Server in ANSI mode, start [**mysqld**](mysqld.md "6.3.1 mysqld — The MySQL Server")
with the [`--ansi`](server-options.md#option_mysqld_ansi) option. Running the
server in ANSI mode is the same as starting it with the following
options:

```terminal
--transaction-isolation=SERIALIZABLE --sql-mode=ANSI
```

To achieve the same effect at runtime, execute these two
statements:

```sql
SET GLOBAL TRANSACTION ISOLATION LEVEL SERIALIZABLE;
SET GLOBAL sql_mode = 'ANSI';
```

You can see that setting the
[`sql_mode`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_sql_mode) system variable to
`'ANSI'` enables all SQL mode options that are
relevant for ANSI mode as follows:

```sql
mysql> SET GLOBAL sql_mode='ANSI';
mysql> SELECT @@GLOBAL.sql_mode;
        -> 'REAL_AS_FLOAT,PIPES_AS_CONCAT,ANSI_QUOTES,IGNORE_SPACE,ANSI'
```

Running the server in ANSI mode with
[`--ansi`](server-options.md#option_mysqld_ansi) is not quite the same as
setting the SQL mode to `'ANSI'` because the
[`--ansi`](server-options.md#option_mysqld_ansi) option also sets the
transaction isolation level.

See [Section 7.1.7, “Server Command Options”](server-options.md "7.1.7 Server Command Options").
