### 2.3.6 Windows Postinstallation Procedures

GUI tools exist that perform most of the tasks described in this
section, including:

- [MySQL Installer](mysql-installer.md "2.3.3 MySQL Installer for Windows"): Used to install
  and upgrade MySQL products.
- [MySQL Workbench](workbench.md "Chapter 33 MySQL Workbench"): Manages the
  MySQL server and edits SQL statements.

If necessary, initialize the data directory and create the MySQL
grant tables. Windows installation operations performed by MySQL Installer
initialize the data directory automatically. For installation from
a ZIP Archive package, initialize the data directory as described
at [Section 2.9.1, “Initializing the Data Directory”](data-directory-initialization.md "2.9.1 Initializing the Data Directory").

Regarding passwords, if you installed MySQL using the MySQL Installer, you
may have already assigned a password to the initial
`root` account. (See
[Section 2.3.3, “MySQL Installer for Windows”](mysql-installer.md "2.3.3 MySQL Installer for Windows").) Otherwise, use the
password-assignment procedure given in
[Section 2.9.4, “Securing the Initial MySQL Account”](default-privileges.md "2.9.4 Securing the Initial MySQL Account").

Before assigning a password, you might want to try running some
client programs to make sure that you can connect to the server
and that it is operating properly. Make sure that the server is
running (see [Section 2.3.4.5, “Starting the Server for the First Time”](windows-server-first-start.md "2.3.4.5 Starting the Server for the First Time")). You
can also set up a MySQL service that runs automatically when
Windows starts (see [Section 2.3.4.8, “Starting MySQL as a Windows Service”](windows-start-service.md "2.3.4.8 Starting MySQL as a Windows Service")).

These instructions assume that your current location is the MySQL
installation directory and that it has a `bin`
subdirectory containing the MySQL programs used here. If that is
not true, adjust the command path names accordingly.

If you installed MySQL using MySQL Installer (see
[Section 2.3.3, “MySQL Installer for Windows”](mysql-installer.md "2.3.3 MySQL Installer for Windows")), the default installation
directory is `C:\Program Files\MySQL\MySQL Server
8.0`:

```terminal
C:\> cd "C:\Program Files\MySQL\MySQL Server 8.0"
```

A common installation location for installation from a ZIP archive
is `C:\mysql`:

```terminal
C:\> cd C:\mysql
```

Alternatively, add the `bin` directory to your
`PATH` environment variable setting. That enables
your command interpreter to find MySQL programs properly, so that
you can run a program by typing only its name, not its path name.
See [Section 2.3.4.7, “Customizing the PATH for MySQL Tools”](mysql-installation-windows-path.md "2.3.4.7 Customizing the PATH for MySQL Tools").

With the server running, issue the following commands to verify
that you can retrieve information from the server. The output
should be similar to that shown here.

Use [**mysqlshow**](mysqlshow.md "6.5.7 mysqlshow — Display Database, Table, and Column Information") to see what databases exist:

```terminal
C:\> bin\mysqlshow
+--------------------+
|     Databases      |
+--------------------+
| information_schema |
| mysql              |
| performance_schema |
| sys                |
+--------------------+
```

The list of installed databases may vary, but always includes at
least `mysql` and
`information_schema`.

The preceding command (and commands for other MySQL programs such
as [**mysql**](mysql.md "6.5.1 mysql — The MySQL Command-Line Client")) may not work if the correct MySQL
account does not exist. For example, the program may fail with an
error, or you may not be able to view all databases. If you
install MySQL using MySQL Installer, the `root` user is
created automatically with the password you supplied. In this
case, you should use the `-u root` and
`-p` options. (You must use those options if you
have already secured the initial MySQL accounts.) With
`-p`, the client program prompts for the
`root` password. For example:

```terminal
C:\> bin\mysqlshow -u root -p
Enter password: (enter root password here)
+--------------------+
|     Databases      |
+--------------------+
| information_schema |
| mysql              |
| performance_schema |
| sys                |
+--------------------+
```

If you specify a database name, [**mysqlshow**](mysqlshow.md "6.5.7 mysqlshow — Display Database, Table, and Column Information")
displays a list of the tables within the database:

```terminal
C:\> bin\mysqlshow mysql
Database: mysql
+---------------------------+
|          Tables           |
+---------------------------+
| columns_priv              |
| component                 |
| db                        |
| default_roles             |
| engine_cost               |
| func                      |
| general_log               |
| global_grants             |
| gtid_executed             |
| help_category             |
| help_keyword              |

| role_edges                |

| servers                   |
| slave_master_info         |
| slave_relay_log_info      |
| slave_worker_info         |
| slow_log                  |
| tables_priv               |
| time_zone                 |
| time_zone_leap_second     |
| time_zone_name            |
| time_zone_transition      |
| time_zone_transition_type |
| user                      |
+---------------------------+
```

Use the [**mysql**](mysql.md "6.5.1 mysql — The MySQL Command-Line Client") program to select information
from a table in the `mysql` database:

```terminal
C:\> bin\mysql -e "SELECT User, Host, plugin FROM mysql.user" mysql
+------+-----------+-----------------------+
| User | Host      | plugin                |
+------+-----------+-----------------------+
| root | localhost | caching_sha2_password |
+------+-----------+-----------------------+
```
