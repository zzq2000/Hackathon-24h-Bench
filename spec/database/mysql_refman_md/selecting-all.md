#### 5.3.4.1 Selecting All Data

The simplest form of [`SELECT`](select.md "15.2.13 SELECT Statement")
retrieves everything from a table:

```sql
mysql> SELECT * FROM pet;
+----------+--------+---------+------+------------+------------+
| name     | owner  | species | sex  | birth      | death      |
+----------+--------+---------+------+------------+------------+
| Fluffy   | Harold | cat     | f    | 1993-02-04 | NULL       |
| Claws    | Gwen   | cat     | m    | 1994-03-17 | NULL       |
| Buffy    | Harold | dog     | f    | 1989-05-13 | NULL       |
| Fang     | Benny  | dog     | m    | 1990-08-27 | NULL       |
| Bowser   | Diane  | dog     | m    | 1979-08-31 | 1995-07-29 |
| Chirpy   | Gwen   | bird    | f    | 1998-09-11 | NULL       |
| Whistler | Gwen   | bird    | NULL | 1997-12-09 | NULL       |
| Slim     | Benny  | snake   | m    | 1996-04-29 | NULL       |
| Puffball | Diane  | hamster | f    | 1999-03-30 | NULL       |
+----------+--------+---------+------+------------+------------+
```

This form of [`SELECT`](select.md "15.2.13 SELECT Statement") uses
`*`, which is shorthand for “select all
columns.” This is useful if you want to review your
entire table, for example, after you've just loaded it with
your initial data set. For example, you may happen to think
that the birth date for Bowser doesn't seem quite right.
Consulting your original pedigree papers, you find that the
correct birth year should be 1989, not 1979.

There are at least two ways to fix this:

- Edit the file `pet.txt` to correct the
  error, then empty the table and reload it using
  [`DELETE`](delete.md "15.2.2 DELETE Statement") and
  [`LOAD DATA`](load-data.md "15.2.9 LOAD DATA Statement"):

  ```sql
  mysql> DELETE FROM pet;
  mysql> LOAD DATA LOCAL INFILE 'pet.txt' INTO TABLE pet;
  ```

  However, if you do this, you must also re-enter the record
  for Puffball.
- Fix only the erroneous record with an
  [`UPDATE`](update.md "15.2.17 UPDATE Statement") statement:

  ```sql
  mysql> UPDATE pet SET birth = '1989-08-31' WHERE name = 'Bowser';
  ```

  The [`UPDATE`](update.md "15.2.17 UPDATE Statement") changes only the
  record in question and does not require you to reload the
  table.

There is an exception to the principle that `SELECT
*` selects all columns. If a table contains invisible
columns, `*` does not include them. For more
information, see [Section 15.1.20.10, “Invisible Columns”](invisible-columns.md "15.1.20.10 Invisible Columns").
