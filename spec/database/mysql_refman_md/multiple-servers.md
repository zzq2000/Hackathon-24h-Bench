In some cases, you might want to run multiple instances of MySQL on
a single machine. You might want to test a new MySQL release while
leaving an existing production setup undisturbed. Or you might want
to give different users access to different
[**mysqld**](mysqld.md "6.3.1 mysqld — The MySQL Server") servers that they manage themselves. (For
example, you might be an Internet Service Provider that wants to
provide independent MySQL installations for different customers.)

It is possible to use a different MySQL server binary per instance,
or use the same binary for multiple instances, or any combination of
the two approaches. For example, you might run a server from MySQL
5.7 and one from MySQL 8.0, to see how
different versions handle a given workload. Or you might run
multiple instances of the current production version, each managing
a different set of databases.

Whether or not you use distinct server binaries, each instance that
you run must be configured with unique values for several operating
parameters. This eliminates the potential for conflict between
instances. Parameters can be set on the command line, in option
files, or by setting environment variables. See
[Section 6.2.2, “Specifying Program Options”](program-options.md "6.2.2 Specifying Program Options"). To see the values used by a given
instance, connect to it and execute a [`SHOW
VARIABLES`](show-variables.md "15.7.7.41 SHOW VARIABLES Statement") statement.

The primary resource managed by a MySQL instance is the data
directory. Each instance should use a different data directory, the
location of which is specified using the
[`--datadir=dir_name`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_datadir)
option. For methods of configuring each instance with its own data
directory, and warnings about the dangers of failing to do so, see
[Section 7.8.1, “Setting Up Multiple Data Directories”](multiple-data-directories.md "7.8.1 Setting Up Multiple Data Directories").

In addition to using different data directories, several other
options must have different values for each server instance:

- [`--port=port_num`](server-options.md#option_mysqld_port)

  [`--port`](server-options.md#option_mysqld_port) controls the port number
  for TCP/IP connections. Alternatively, if the host has multiple
  network addresses, you can set the
  [`bind_address`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_bind_address) system variable to
  cause each server to listen to a different address.
- [`--socket={file_name|pipe_name}`](server-options.md#option_mysqld_socket)

  [`--socket`](server-options.md#option_mysqld_socket) controls the Unix socket
  file path on Unix or the named-pipe name on Windows. On Windows,
  it is necessary to specify distinct pipe names only for those
  servers configured to permit named-pipe connections.
- [`--shared-memory-base-name=name`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_shared_memory_base_name)

  This option is used only on Windows. It designates the
  shared-memory name used by a Windows server to permit clients to
  connect using shared memory. It is necessary to specify distinct
  shared-memory names only for those servers configured to permit
  shared-memory connections.
- [`--pid-file=file_name`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_pid_file)

  This option indicates the path name of the file in which the
  server writes its process ID.

If you use the following log file options, their values must differ
for each server:

- [`--general_log_file=file_name`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_general_log_file)
- [`--log-bin[=file_name]`](replication-options-binary-log.md#option_mysqld_log-bin)
- [`--slow_query_log_file=file_name`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_slow_query_log_file)
- [`--log-error[=file_name]`](server-options.md#option_mysqld_log-error)

For further discussion of log file options, see
[Section 7.4, “MySQL Server Logs”](server-logs.md "7.4 MySQL Server Logs").

To achieve better performance, you can specify the following option
differently for each server, to spread the load between several
physical disks:

- [`--tmpdir=dir_name`](server-options.md#option_mysqld_tmpdir)

Having different temporary directories also makes it easier to
determine which MySQL server created any given temporary file.

If you have multiple MySQL installations in different locations, you
can specify the base directory for each installation with the
[`--basedir=dir_name`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_basedir)
option. This causes each instance to automatically use a different
data directory, log files, and PID file because the default for each
of those parameters is relative to the base directory. In that case,
the only other options you need to specify are the
[`--socket`](server-options.md#option_mysqld_socket) and
[`--port`](server-options.md#option_mysqld_port) options. Suppose that you
install different versions of MySQL using `tar`
file binary distributions. These install in different locations, so
you can start the server for each installation using the command
**bin/mysqld\_safe** under its corresponding base
directory. [**mysqld\_safe**](mysqld-safe.md "6.3.2 mysqld_safe — MySQL Server Startup Script") determines the proper
[`--basedir`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_basedir) option to pass to
[**mysqld**](mysqld.md "6.3.1 mysqld — The MySQL Server"), and you need specify only the
[`--socket`](mysqld-safe.md#option_mysqld_safe_socket) and
[`--port`](mysqld-safe.md#option_mysqld_safe_port) options to
[**mysqld\_safe**](mysqld-safe.md "6.3.2 mysqld_safe — MySQL Server Startup Script").

As discussed in the following sections, it is possible to start
additional servers by specifying appropriate command options or by
setting environment variables. However, if you need to run multiple
servers on a more permanent basis, it is more convenient to use
option files to specify for each server those option values that
must be unique to it. The
[`--defaults-file`](option-file-options.md#option_general_defaults-file) option is useful for
this purpose.
