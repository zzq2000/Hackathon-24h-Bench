#### 25.6.16.61 The ndbinfo threadblocks Table

The `threadblocks` table associates data nodes,
threads, and instances of `NDB` kernel blocks.

The `threadblocks` table contains the following
columns:

- `node_id`

  Node ID
- `thr_no`

  Thread ID
- `block_name`

  Block name
- `block_instance`

  Block instance number

##### Notes

The value of the `block_name` in this table is
one of the values found in the `block_name`
column when selecting from the
[`ndbinfo.blocks`](mysql-cluster-ndbinfo-blocks.md "25.6.16.5 The ndbinfo blocks Table") table. Although
the list of possible values is static for a given NDB Cluster
release, the list may vary between releases.

The `block_instance` column provides the kernel
block instance number.
