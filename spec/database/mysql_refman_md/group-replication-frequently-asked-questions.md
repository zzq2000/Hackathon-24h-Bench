## 20.10 Frequently Asked Questions

This section provides answers to frequently asked questions.

### What is the maximum number of MySQL servers in a group?

A group can consist of maximum 9 servers. Attempting to add
another server to a group with 9 members causes the request to
join to be refused. This limit has been identified from testing
and benchmarking as a safe boundary where the group performs
reliably on a stable local area network.

### How are servers in a group connected?

Servers in a group connect to the other servers in the group by
opening a peer-to-peer TCP connection. These connections are only
used for internal communication and message passing between
servers in the group. This address is configured by the
[`group_replication_local_address`](group-replication-system-variables.md#sysvar_group_replication_local_address)
variable.

### What is the group\_replication\_bootstrap\_group option used for?

The bootstrap flag instructs a member to
*create* a group and act as the initial seed
server. The second member joining the group needs to ask the
member that bootstrapped the group to dynamically change the
configuration in order for it to be added to the group.

A member needs to bootstrap the group in two scenarios. When the
group is originally created, or when shutting down and restarting
the entire group.

### How do I set credentials for the distributed recovery process?

You can set the user credentials permanently as the credentials
for the `group_replication_recovery` channel,
using a [`CHANGE REPLICATION SOURCE
TO`](change-replication-source-to.md "15.4.2.3 CHANGE REPLICATION SOURCE TO Statement") statement (from MySQL 8.0.23) or
[`CHANGE MASTER TO`](change-master-to.md "15.4.2.1 CHANGE MASTER TO Statement") statement (before
MySQL 8.0.23). Alternatively, from MySQL 8.0.21, you can specify
them on the [`START GROUP_REPLICATION`](start-group-replication.md "15.4.3.1 START GROUP_REPLICATION Statement")
statement each time Group Replication is started.

User credentials set using [`CHANGE REPLICATION
SOURCE TO`](change-replication-source-to.md "15.4.2.3 CHANGE REPLICATION SOURCE TO Statement") | [`CHANGE MASTER
TO`](change-master-to.md "15.4.2.1 CHANGE MASTER TO Statement") are stored in plain text in the replication metadata
repositories on the server, but user credentials specified on
[`START GROUP_REPLICATION`](start-group-replication.md "15.4.3.1 START GROUP_REPLICATION Statement") are saved
in memory only, and are removed by a [`STOP
GROUP_REPLICATION`](stop-group-replication.md "15.4.3.2 STOP GROUP_REPLICATION Statement") statement or server shutdown. Using
[`START GROUP_REPLICATION`](start-group-replication.md "15.4.3.1 START GROUP_REPLICATION Statement") to specify
the user credentials therefore helps to secure the Group
Replication servers against unauthorized access. However, this
method is not compatible with starting Group Replication
automatically, as specified by the
[`group_replication_start_on_boot`](group-replication-system-variables.md#sysvar_group_replication_start_on_boot)
system variable. For more information, see
[Section 20.6.3.1, “Secure User Credentials for Distributed Recovery”](group-replication-secure-user.md "20.6.3.1 Secure User Credentials for Distributed Recovery").

### Can I scale-out my write-load using Group Replication?

Not directly, but MySQL Group replication is a shared nothing full
replication solution, where all servers in the group replicate the
same amount of data. Therefore if one member in the group writes N
bytes to storage as the result of a transaction commit operation,
then roughly N bytes are written to storage on other members as
well, because the transaction is replicated everywhere.

However, given that other members do not have to do the same
amount of processing that the original member had to do when it
originally executed the transaction, they apply the changes
faster. Transactions are replicated in a format that is used to
apply row transformations only, without having to re-execute
transactions again (row-based format).

Furthermore, given that changes are propagated and applied in
row-based format, this means that they are received in an
optimized and compact format, and likely reducing the number of IO
operations required when compared to the originating member.

To summarize, you can scale-out processing, by spreading conflict
free transactions throughout different members in the group. And
you can likely scale-out a small fraction of your IO operations,
since remote servers receive only the necessary changes to
read-modify-write changes to stable storage.

### Does Group Replication require more network bandwidth and CPU, when compared to simple replication and under the same workload?

Some additional load is expected because servers need to be
constantly interacting with each other for synchronization
purposes. It is difficult to quantify how much more data. It also
depends on the size of the group (three servers puts less stress
on the bandwidth requirements than nine servers in the group).

Also the memory and CPU footprint are larger, because more complex
work is done for the server synchronization part and for the group
messaging.

### Can I deploy Group Replication across wide-area networks?

Yes, but the network connection between each member
*must* be reliable and have suitable
performance. Low latency, high bandwidth network connections are a
requirement for optimal performance.

If network bandwidth alone is an issue, then
[Section 20.7.4, “Message Compression”](group-replication-message-compression.md "20.7.4 Message Compression") can be
used to lower the bandwidth required. However, if the network
drops packets, leading to re-transmissions and higher end-to-end
latency, throughput and latency are both negatively affected.

Warning

When the network round-trip time (RTT) between any group members
is 5 seconds or more you could encounter problems as the
built-in failure detection mechanism could be incorrectly
triggered.

### Do members automatically rejoin a group in case of temporary connectivity problems?

This depends on the reason for the connectivity problem. If the
connectivity problem is transient and the reconnection is quick
enough that the failure detector is not aware of it, then the
server may not be removed from the group. If it is a
"long" connectivity problem, then the failure detector
eventually suspects a problem and the server is removed from the
group.

From MySQL 8.0, two settings are available to increase the chances
of a member remaining in or rejoining a group:

- [`group_replication_member_expel_timeout`](group-replication-system-variables.md#sysvar_group_replication_member_expel_timeout)
  increases the time between the creation of a suspicion (which
  happens after an initial 5-second detection period) and the
  expulsion of the member. You can set a waiting period of up to
  1 hour. From MySQL 8.0.21, a waiting period of 5 seconds is
  set by default.
- [`group_replication_autorejoin_tries`](group-replication-system-variables.md#sysvar_group_replication_autorejoin_tries)
  makes a member try to rejoin the group after an expulsion or
  unreachable majority timeout. The member makes the specified
  number of auto-rejoin attempts five minutes apart. From MySQL
  8.0.21, this feature is activated by default and the member
  makes three auto-rejoin attempts.

If a server is expelled from the group and any auto-rejoin
attempts do not succeed, you need to join it back again. In other
words, after a server is removed explicitly from the group you
need to rejoin it manually (or have a script doing it
automatically).

### When is a member excluded from a group?

If the member becomes silent, the other members remove it from the
group configuration. In practice this may happen when the member
has crashed or there is a network disconnection.

The failure is detected after a given timeout elapses for a given
member and a new configuration without the silent member in it is
created.

### What happens when one node is significantly lagging behind?

There is no method for defining policies for when to expel members
automatically from the group. You need to find out why a member is
lagging behind and fix that or remove the member from the group.
Otherwise, if the server is so slow that it triggers the flow
control, then the entire group slows down as well. The flow
control can be configured according to the your needs.

### Upon suspicion of a problem in the group, is there a special member responsible for triggering a reconfiguration?

No, there is no special member in the group in charge of
triggering a reconfiguration.

Any member can suspect that there is a problem. All members need
to (automatically) agree that a given member has failed. One
member is in charge of expelling it from the group, by triggering
a reconfiguration. Which member is responsible for expelling the
member is not something you can control or set.

### Can I use Group Replication for sharding?

Group Replication is designed to provide highly available replica
sets; data and writes are duplicated on each member in the group.
For scaling beyond what a single system can provide, you need an
orchestration and sharding framework built around a number of
Group Replication sets, where each replica set maintains and
manages a given shard or partition of your total dataset. This
type of setup, often called a “sharded cluster”,
allows you to scale reads and writes linearly and without limit.

### How do I use Group Replication with SELinux?

If SELinux is enabled, which you can verify using
**sestatus -v**, then you need to enable the use of
the Group Replication communication port. See
[Setting the TCP Port Context for Group Replication](selinux-context-mysql-feature-ports.md#selinux-context-group-replication-port "Setting the TCP Port Context for Group Replication").

### How do I use Group Replication with iptables?

If **iptables** is enabled, then you need to open
up the Group Replication port for communication between the
machines. To see the current rules in place on each machine, issue
**iptables -L**. Assuming the port configured is
33061, enable communication over the necessary port by issuing
**iptables -A INPUT -p tcp --dport 33061 -j
ACCEPT**.

### How do I recover the relay log for a replication channel used by a group member?

The replication channels used by Group Replication behave in the
same way as replication channels used in asynchronous source to
replica replication, and as such rely on the relay log. In the
event of a change of the
[`relay_log`](replication-options-replica.md#sysvar_relay_log) variable, or when the
option is not set and the host name changes, there is a chance of
errors. See [Section 19.2.4.1, “The Relay Log”](replica-logs-relaylog.md "19.2.4.1 The Relay Log") for a recovery
procedure in this situation. Alternatively, another way of fixing
the issue specifically in Group Replication is to issue a
[`STOP GROUP_REPLICATION`](stop-group-replication.md "15.4.3.2 STOP GROUP_REPLICATION Statement") statement
and then a [`START GROUP_REPLICATION`](start-group-replication.md "15.4.3.1 START GROUP_REPLICATION Statement")
statement to restart the instance. The Group Replication plugin
creates the `group_replication_applier` channel
again.

### Why does Group Replication use two bind addresses?

Group Replication uses two bind addresses in order to split
network traffic between the SQL address, used by clients to
communicate with the member, and the
[`group_replication_local_address`](group-replication-system-variables.md#sysvar_group_replication_local_address),
used internally by the group members to communicate. For example,
assume a server with two network interfaces assigned to the
network addresses `203.0.113.1` and
`198.51.100.179`. In such a situation you could
use `203.0.113.1:33061` for the internal group
network address by setting
[`group_replication_local_address=203.0.113.1:33061`](group-replication-system-variables.md#sysvar_group_replication_local_address).
Then you could use `198.51.100.179` for
[`hostname`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_hostname) and
`3306` for the
[`port`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_port). Client SQL applications
would then connect to the member at
`198.51.100.179:3306`. This enables you to
configure different rules on the different networks. Similarly,
the internal group communication can be separated from the network
connection used for client applications, for increased security.

### How does Group Replication use network addresses and hostnames?

Group Replication uses network connections between members and
therefore its functionality is directly impacted by how you
configure hostnames and ports. For example, Group Replication's
distributed recovery process creates a connection to an existing
group member using the server's hostname and port. When a member
joins a group it receives the group membership information, using
the network address information that is listed at
[`performance_schema.replication_group_members`](performance-schema-replication-group-members-table.md "29.12.11.16 The replication_group_members Table").
One of the members listed in that table is selected as the donor
of the missing data from the group to the joining member.

This means that any value you configure using a hostname, such as
the SQL network address or the group seeds address, must be a
fully qualified name and resolvable by each member of the group.
You can ensure this for example through DNS, or correctly
configured `/etc/hosts` files, or other local
processes. If a you want to configure the
`MEMBER_HOST` value on a server, specify it using
the [`--report-host`](replication-options-replica.md#sysvar_report_host) option on the
server before joining it to the group.

Important

The assigned value is used directly and is not affected by the
[`skip_name_resolve`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_skip_name_resolve) system
variable.

To configure `MEMBER_PORT` on a server, specify
it using the [`report_port`](replication-options-replica.md#sysvar_report_port) system
variable.

### Why did the auto increment setting on the server change?

When Group Replication is started on a server, the value of
[`auto_increment_increment`](replication-options-source.md#sysvar_auto_increment_increment) is
changed to the value of
[`group_replication_auto_increment_increment`](group-replication-system-variables.md#sysvar_group_replication_auto_increment_increment),
which defaults to 7, and the value of
[`auto_increment_offset`](replication-options-source.md#sysvar_auto_increment_offset) is changed
to the server ID. The changes are reverted when Group Replication
is stopped. These settings avoid the selection of duplicate
auto-increment values for writes on group members, which causes
rollback of transactions. The default auto increment value of 7
for Group Replication represents a balance between the number of
usable values and the permitted maximum size of a replication
group (9 members).

The changes are only made and reverted if
[`auto_increment_increment`](replication-options-source.md#sysvar_auto_increment_increment) and
[`auto_increment_offset`](replication-options-source.md#sysvar_auto_increment_offset) each have
their default value of 1. If their values have already been
modified from the default, Group Replication does not alter them.
From MySQL 8.0, the system variables are also not modified when
Group Replication is in single-primary mode, where only one server
writes.

### How do I find the primary?

If the group is operating in single-primary mode, it can be useful
to find out which member is the primary. See
[Section 20.1.3.1.2, “Finding the Primary”](group-replication-single-primary-mode.md#group-replication-find-primary "20.1.3.1.2 Finding the Primary")
