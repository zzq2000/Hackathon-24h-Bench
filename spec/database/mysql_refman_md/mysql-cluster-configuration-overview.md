### 25.4.2 Overview of NDB Cluster Configuration Parameters, Options, and Variables

[25.4.2.1 NDB Cluster Data Node Configuration Parameters](mysql-cluster-params-ndbd.md)

[25.4.2.2 NDB Cluster Management Node Configuration Parameters](mysql-cluster-params-mgmd.md)

[25.4.2.3 NDB Cluster SQL Node and API Node Configuration Parameters](mysql-cluster-params-api.md)

[25.4.2.4 Other NDB Cluster Configuration Parameters](mysql-cluster-params-other.md)

[25.4.2.5 NDB Cluster mysqld Option and Variable Reference](mysql-cluster-option-tables.md)

The next several sections provide summary tables of NDB Cluster
node configuration parameters used in the
`config.ini` file to govern various aspects of
node behavior, as well as of options and variables read by
[**mysqld**](mysqld.md "6.3.1 mysqld — The MySQL Server") from a `my.cnf` file
or from the command line when run as an NDB Cluster process. Each
of the node parameter tables lists the parameters for a given type
(`ndbd`, `ndb_mgmd`,
`mysqld`, `computer`,
`tcp`, or `shm`). All tables
include the data type for the parameter, option, or variable, as
well as its default, minimum, and maximum values as applicable.

**Considerations when restarting nodes.**
For node parameters, these tables also indicate what type of
restart is required (node restart or system restart)—and
whether the restart must be done with
`--initial`—to change the value of a given
configuration parameter. When performing a node restart or an
initial node restart, all of the cluster's data nodes must
be restarted in turn (also referred to as a
rolling restart). It is
possible to update cluster configuration parameters marked as
`node` online—that is, without shutting
down the cluster—in this fashion. An initial node restart
requires restarting each [**ndbd**](mysql-cluster-programs-ndbd.md "25.5.1 ndbd — The NDB Cluster Data Node Daemon") process with
the `--initial` option.

A system restart requires a complete shutdown and restart of the
entire cluster. An initial system restart requires taking a backup
of the cluster, wiping the cluster file system after shutdown, and
then restoring from the backup following the restart.

In any cluster restart, all of the cluster's management servers
must be restarted for them to read the updated configuration
parameter values.

Important

Values for numeric cluster parameters can generally be increased
without any problems, although it is advisable to do so
progressively, making such adjustments in relatively small
increments. Many of these can be increased online, using a
rolling restart.

However, decreasing the values of such parameters—whether
this is done using a node restart, node initial restart, or even
a complete system restart of the cluster—is not to be
undertaken lightly; it is recommended that you do so only after
careful planning and testing. This is especially true with
regard to those parameters that relate to memory usage and disk
space, such as
[`MaxNoOfTables`](mysql-cluster-ndbd-definition.md#ndbparam-ndbd-maxnooftables),
[`MaxNoOfOrderedIndexes`](mysql-cluster-ndbd-definition.md#ndbparam-ndbd-maxnooforderedindexes),
and
[`MaxNoOfUniqueHashIndexes`](mysql-cluster-ndbd-definition.md#ndbparam-ndbd-maxnoofuniquehashindexes).
In addition, it is the generally the case that configuration
parameters relating to memory and disk usage can be raised using
a simple node restart, but they require an initial node restart
to be lowered.

Because some of these parameters can be used for configuring more
than one type of cluster node, they may appear in more than one of
the tables.

Note

`4294967039` often appears as a maximum value
in these tables. This value is defined in the
[`NDBCLUSTER`](mysql-cluster.md "Chapter 25 MySQL NDB Cluster 8.0") sources as
`MAX_INT_RNIL` and is equal to
`0xFFFFFEFF`, or
`232 −
28 − 1`.
