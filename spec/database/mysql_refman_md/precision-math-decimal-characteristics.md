### 14.24.2 DECIMAL Data Type Characteristics

This section discusses the characteristics of the
[`DECIMAL`](fixed-point-types.md "13.1.3 Fixed-Point Types (Exact Value) - DECIMAL, NUMERIC") data type (and its
synonyms), with particular regard to the following topics:

- Maximum number of digits
- Storage format
- Storage requirements
- The nonstandard MySQL extension to the upper range of
  [`DECIMAL`](fixed-point-types.md "13.1.3 Fixed-Point Types (Exact Value) - DECIMAL, NUMERIC") columns

The declaration syntax for a
[`DECIMAL`](fixed-point-types.md "13.1.3 Fixed-Point Types (Exact Value) - DECIMAL, NUMERIC") column is
`DECIMAL(M,D)`.
The ranges of values for the arguments are as follows:

- *`M`* is the maximum number of digits
  (the precision). It has a range of 1 to 65.
- *`D`* is the number of digits to the
  right of the decimal point (the scale). It has a range of 0 to
  30 and must be no larger than *`M`*.

If *`D`* is omitted, the default is 0. If
*`M`* is omitted, the default is 10.

The maximum value of 65 for *`M`* means
that calculations on [`DECIMAL`](fixed-point-types.md "13.1.3 Fixed-Point Types (Exact Value) - DECIMAL, NUMERIC") values
are accurate up to 65 digits. This limit of 65 digits of precision
also applies to exact-value numeric literals, so the maximum range
of such literals differs from before. (There is also a limit on
how long the text of [`DECIMAL`](fixed-point-types.md "13.1.3 Fixed-Point Types (Exact Value) - DECIMAL, NUMERIC")
literals can be; see
[Section 14.24.3, “Expression Handling”](precision-math-expressions.md "14.24.3 Expression Handling").)

Values for [`DECIMAL`](fixed-point-types.md "13.1.3 Fixed-Point Types (Exact Value) - DECIMAL, NUMERIC") columns are
stored using a binary format that packs nine decimal digits into 4
bytes. The storage requirements for the integer and fractional
parts of each value are determined separately. Each multiple of
nine digits requires 4 bytes, and any remaining digits left over
require some fraction of 4 bytes. The storage required for
remaining digits is given by the following table.

| Leftover Digits | Number of Bytes |
| --- | --- |
| 0 | 0 |
| 1–2 | 1 |
| 3–4 | 2 |
| 5–6 | 3 |
| 7–9 | 4 |

For example, a `DECIMAL(18,9)` column has nine
digits on either side of the decimal point, so the integer part
and the fractional part each require 4 bytes. A
`DECIMAL(20,6)` column has fourteen integer
digits and six fractional digits. The integer digits require four
bytes for nine of the digits and 3 bytes for the remaining five
digits. The six fractional digits require 3 bytes.

[`DECIMAL`](fixed-point-types.md "13.1.3 Fixed-Point Types (Exact Value) - DECIMAL, NUMERIC") columns do not store a
leading `+` character or `-`
character or leading `0` digits. If you insert
`+0003.1` into a `DECIMAL(5,1)`
column, it is stored as `3.1`. For negative
numbers, a literal `-` character is not stored.

[`DECIMAL`](fixed-point-types.md "13.1.3 Fixed-Point Types (Exact Value) - DECIMAL, NUMERIC") columns do not permit
values larger than the range implied by the column definition. For
example, a `DECIMAL(3,0)` column supports a range
of `-999` to `999`. A
`DECIMAL(M,D)`
column permits up to *`M`* -
*`D`* digits to the left of the decimal
point.

The SQL standard requires that the precision of
`NUMERIC(M,D)`
be *exactly* *`M`*
digits. For
`DECIMAL(M,D)`,
the standard requires a precision of at least
*`M`* digits but permits more. In MySQL,
`DECIMAL(M,D)`
and
`NUMERIC(M,D)`
are the same, and both have a precision of exactly
*`M`* digits.

For a full explanation of the internal format of
`DECIMAL` values, see the file
`strings/decimal.c` in a MySQL source
distribution. The format is explained (with an example) in the
`decimal2bin()` function.
