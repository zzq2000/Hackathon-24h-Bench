#### 30.4.4.3 The execute\_prepared\_stmt() Procedure

Given an SQL statement as a string, executes it as a prepared
statement. The prepared statement is deallocated after
execution, so it is not subject to reuse. Thus, this procedure
is useful primarily for executing dynamic statements on a
one-time basis.

This procedure uses
`sys_execute_prepared_stmt` as the prepared
statement name. If that statement name exists when the
procedure is called, its previous content is destroyed.

##### Parameters

- `in_query LONGTEXT CHARACTER SET
  utf8mb3`: The statement string to execute.

##### Configuration Options

[`execute_prepared_stmt()`](sys-execute-prepared-stmt.md "30.4.4.3 The execute_prepared_stmt() Procedure")
operation can be modified using the following configuration
options or their corresponding user-defined variables (see
[Section 30.4.2.1, “The sys\_config Table”](sys-sys-config.md "30.4.2.1 The sys_config Table")):

- `debug`, `@sys.debug`

  If this option is `ON`, produce
  debugging output. The default is `OFF`.

##### Example

```sql
mysql> CALL sys.execute_prepared_stmt('SELECT COUNT(*) FROM mysql.user');
+----------+
| COUNT(*) |
+----------+
|       15 |
+----------+
```
