#### 29.12.19.2 The clone\_progress Table

Note

The Performance Schema table described here is available as
of MySQL 8.0.17.

The `clone_progress` table shows progress
information for the current or last executed cloning operation
only.

The stages of a cloning operation include `DROP
DATA`, `FILE COPY`,
`PAGE_COPY`, `REDO_COPY`,
`FILE_SYNC`, `RESTART`, and
`RECOVERY`. A cloning operation produces a
record for each stage. The table therefore only ever contains
seven rows of data, or is empty.

The `clone_progress` table has these columns:

- `ID`

  A unique cloning operation identifier in the current MySQL
  server instance.
- `STAGE`

  The name of the current cloning stage. Stages include
  `DROP DATA`, `FILE
  COPY`, `PAGE_COPY`,
  `REDO_COPY`,
  `FILE_SYNC`, `RESTART`,
  and `RECOVERY`.
- `STATE`

  The current state of the cloning stage. States include
  `Not Started`, `In
  Progress`, and `Completed`.
- `BEGIN_TIME`

  A timestamp in `'YYYY-MM-DD
  hh:mm:ss[.fraction]'`
  format that shows when the cloning stage started. Reports
  NULL if the stage has not started.
- `END_TIME`

  A timestamp in `'YYYY-MM-DD
  hh:mm:ss[.fraction]'`
  format that shows when the cloning stage finished. Reports
  NULL if the stage has not ended.
- `THREADS`

  The number of concurrent threads used in the stage.
- `ESTIMATE`

  The estimated amount of data for the current stage, in
  bytes.
- `DATA`

  The amount of data transferred in current state, in bytes.
- `NETWORK`

  The amount of network data transferred in the current
  state, in bytes.
- `DATA_SPEED`

  The current actual speed of data transfer, in bytes per
  second. This value may differ from the requested maximum
  data transfer rate defined by
  [`clone_max_data_bandwidth`](clone-plugin-options-variables.md#sysvar_clone_max_data_bandwidth).
- `NETWORK_SPEED`

  The current speed of network transfer in bytes per second.

The `clone_progress` table is read-only. DDL,
including [`TRUNCATE TABLE`](truncate-table.md "15.1.37 TRUNCATE TABLE Statement"), is
not permitted.
