#### 19.5.1.25 Replication and REPAIR TABLE

When used on a corrupted or otherwise damaged table, it is
possible for the [`REPAIR TABLE`](repair-table.md "15.7.3.5 REPAIR TABLE Statement")
statement to delete rows that cannot be recovered. However, any
such modifications of table data performed by this statement are
not replicated, which can cause source and replica to lose
synchronization. For this reason, in the event that a table on
the source becomes damaged and you use
[`REPAIR TABLE`](repair-table.md "15.7.3.5 REPAIR TABLE Statement") to repair it, you
should first stop replication (if it is still running) before
using [`REPAIR TABLE`](repair-table.md "15.7.3.5 REPAIR TABLE Statement"), then
afterward compare the source's and replica's copies of
the table and be prepared to correct any discrepancies manually,
before restarting replication.
