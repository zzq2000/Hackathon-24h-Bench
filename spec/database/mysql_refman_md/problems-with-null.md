#### B.3.4.3 Problems with NULL Values

The concept of the `NULL` value is a common
source of confusion for newcomers to SQL, who often think that
`NULL` is the same thing as an empty string
`''`. This is not the case. For example, the
following statements are completely different:

```sql
mysql> INSERT INTO my_table (phone) VALUES (NULL);
mysql> INSERT INTO my_table (phone) VALUES ('');
```

Both statements insert a value into the
`phone` column, but the first inserts a
`NULL` value and the second inserts an empty
string. The meaning of the first can be regarded as
“phone number is not known” and the meaning of
the second can be regarded as “the person is known to
have no phone, and thus no phone number.”

To help with `NULL` handling, you can use the
[`IS NULL`](comparison-operators.md#operator_is-null) and [`IS
NOT NULL`](comparison-operators.md#operator_is-not-null) operators and the
[`IFNULL()`](flow-control-functions.md#function_ifnull) function.

In SQL, the `NULL` value is never true in
comparison to any other value, even `NULL`.
An expression that contains `NULL` always
produces a `NULL` value unless otherwise
indicated in the documentation for the operators and functions
involved in the expression. All columns in the following
example return `NULL`:

```sql
mysql> SELECT NULL, 1+NULL, CONCAT('Invisible',NULL);
```

To search for column values that are `NULL`,
you cannot use an `expr = NULL` test. The
following statement returns no rows, because `expr =
NULL` is never true for any expression:

```sql
mysql> SELECT * FROM my_table WHERE phone = NULL;
```

To look for `NULL` values, you must use the
[`IS NULL`](comparison-operators.md#operator_is-null) test. The following
statements show how to find the `NULL` phone
number and the empty phone number:

```sql
mysql> SELECT * FROM my_table WHERE phone IS NULL;
mysql> SELECT * FROM my_table WHERE phone = '';
```

See [Section 5.3.4.6, “Working with NULL Values”](working-with-null.md "5.3.4.6 Working with NULL Values"), for additional
information and examples.

You can add an index on a column that can have
`NULL` values if you are using the
`MyISAM`, `InnoDB`, or
`MEMORY` storage engine. Otherwise, you must
declare an indexed column `NOT NULL`, and you
cannot insert `NULL` into the column.

When reading data with [`LOAD
DATA`](load-data.md "15.2.9 LOAD DATA Statement"), empty or missing columns are updated with
`''`. To load a `NULL` value
into a column, use `\N` in the data file. The
literal word `NULL` may also be used under
some circumstances. See [Section 15.2.9, “LOAD DATA Statement”](load-data.md "15.2.9 LOAD DATA Statement").

When using `DISTINCT`, `GROUP
BY`, or `ORDER BY`, all
`NULL` values are regarded as equal.

When using `ORDER BY`,
`NULL` values are presented first, or last if
you specify `DESC` to sort in descending
order.

Aggregate (group) functions such as
[`COUNT()`](aggregate-functions.md#function_count),
[`MIN()`](aggregate-functions.md#function_min), and
[`SUM()`](aggregate-functions.md#function_sum) ignore
`NULL` values. The exception to this is
[`COUNT(*)`](aggregate-functions.md#function_count), which counts rows and
not individual column values. For example, the following
statement produces two counts. The first is a count of the
number of rows in the table, and the second is a count of the
number of non-`NULL` values in the
`age` column:

```sql
mysql> SELECT COUNT(*), COUNT(age) FROM person;
```

For some data types, MySQL handles `NULL`
values in special ways. For example, if you insert
`NULL` into an integer or floating-point
column that has the `AUTO_INCREMENT`
attribute, the next number in the sequence is inserted. Under
certain conditions, if you insert `NULL` into
a [`TIMESTAMP`](datetime.md "13.2.2 The DATE, DATETIME, and TIMESTAMP Types") column, the current
date and time is inserted; this behavior depends in part on
the server SQL mode (see [Section 7.1.11, “Server SQL Modes”](sql-mode.md "7.1.11 Server SQL Modes")) as well
as the value of the
[`explicit_defaults_for_timestamp`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_explicit_defaults_for_timestamp)
system variable.
