### 13.2.4 The YEAR Type

The `YEAR` type is a 1-byte type used to
represent year values. It can be declared as
`YEAR` with an implicit display width of 4
characters, or equivalently as `YEAR(4)` with
an explicit display width.

Note

As of MySQL 8.0.19, the [`YEAR(4)`](year.md "13.2.4 The YEAR Type")
data type with an explicit display width is deprecated and you
should expect support for it to be removed in a future version
of MySQL. Instead, use [`YEAR`](year.md "13.2.4 The YEAR Type")
without a display width, which has the same meaning.

MySQL 8.0 does not support the 2-digit
[`YEAR(2)`](year.md "13.2.4 The YEAR Type") data type permitted in
older versions of MySQL. For instructions on converting to
4-digit [`YEAR`](year.md "13.2.4 The YEAR Type"), see
[2-Digit YEAR(2) Limitations and Migrating to 4-Digit YEAR](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/migrating-from-year2.html), in
[MySQL 5.7 Reference Manual](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/).

MySQL displays `YEAR` values in
*`YYYY`* format, with a range of
`1901` to `2155`, and
`0000`.

`YEAR` accepts input values in a variety of
formats:

- As 4-digit strings in the range `'1901'` to
  `'2155'`.
- As 4-digit numbers in the range `1901` to
  `2155`.
- As 1- or 2-digit strings in the range `'0'`
  to `'99'`. MySQL converts values in the
  ranges `'0'` to `'69'` and
  `'70'` to `'99'` to
  `YEAR` values in the ranges
  `2000` to `2069` and
  `1970` to `1999`.
- As 1- or 2-digit numbers in the range `0`
  to `99`. MySQL converts values in the
  ranges `1` to `69` and
  `70` to `99` to
  `YEAR` values in the ranges
  `2001` to `2069` and
  `1970` to `1999`.

  The result of inserting a numeric `0` has a
  display value of `0000` and an internal
  value of `0000`. To insert zero and have it
  be interpreted as `2000`, specify it as a
  string `'0'` or `'00'`.
- As the result of functions that return a value that is
  acceptable in `YEAR` context, such as
  [`NOW()`](date-and-time-functions.md#function_now).

If strict SQL mode is not enabled, MySQL converts invalid
`YEAR` values to `0000`. In
strict SQL mode, attempting to insert an invalid
`YEAR` value produces an error.
