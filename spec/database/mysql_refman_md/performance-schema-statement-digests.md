## 29.10 Performance Schema Statement Digests and Sampling

The MySQL server is capable of maintaining statement digest
information. The digesting process converts each SQL statement to
normalized form (the statement digest) and computes a SHA-256 hash
value (the digest hash value) from the normalized result.
Normalization permits statements that are similar to be grouped
and summarized to expose information about the types of statements
the server is executing and how often they occur. For each digest,
a representative statement that produces the digest is stored as a
sample. This section describes how statement digesting and
sampling occur and how they can be useful.

Digesting occurs in the parser regardless of whether the
Performance Schema is available, so that other features such as
MySQL Enterprise Firewall and query rewrite plugins have access to statement digests.

- [Statement Digests in the Performance Schema](performance-schema-statement-digests.md#statement-digests-performance-schema "Statement Digests in the Performance Schema")
- [Statement Digest Memory Use](performance-schema-statement-digests.md#statement-digests-memory-use "Statement Digest Memory Use")
- [Statement Sampling](performance-schema-statement-digests.md#statement-digests-sampling "Statement Sampling")

### Statement Digest General Concepts

When the parser receives an SQL statement, it computes a
statement digest if that digest is needed, which is true if any
of the following conditions are true:

- Performance Schema digest instrumentation is enabled
- MySQL Enterprise Firewall is enabled
- A query rewrite plugin is enabled

The parser is also used by the
[`STATEMENT_DIGEST_TEXT()`](encryption-functions.md#function_statement-digest-text) and
[`STATEMENT_DIGEST()`](encryption-functions.md#function_statement-digest) functions,
which applications can call to compute a normalized statement
digest and a digest hash value, respectively, from an SQL
statement.

The [`max_digest_length`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_max_digest_length) system
variable value determines the maximum number of bytes available
per session for computation of normalized statement digests.
Once that amount of space is used during digest computation,
truncation occurs: no further tokens from a parsed statement are
collected or figure into its digest value. Statements that
differ only after that many bytes of parsed tokens produce the
same normalized statement digest and are considered identical if
compared or if aggregated for digest statistics.

Warning

Setting the [`max_digest_length`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_max_digest_length)
system variable to zero disables digest production, which also
disables server functionality that requires digests.

After the normalized statement has been computed, a SHA-256 hash
value is computed from it. In addition:

- If MySQL Enterprise Firewall is enabled, it is called and the digest as
  computed is available to it.
- If any query rewrite plugin is enabled, it is called and the
  statement digest and digest value are available to it.
- If the Performance Schema has digest instrumentation
  enabled, it makes a copy of the normalized statement digest,
  allocating a maximum of
  [`performance_schema_max_digest_length`](performance-schema-system-variables.md#sysvar_performance_schema_max_digest_length)
  bytes for it. Consequently, if
  [`performance_schema_max_digest_length`](performance-schema-system-variables.md#sysvar_performance_schema_max_digest_length)
  is less than
  [`max_digest_length`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_max_digest_length), the copy
  is truncated relative to the original. The copy of the
  normalized statement digest is stored in the appropriate
  Performance Schema tables, along with the SHA-256 hash value
  computed from the original normalized statement. (If the
  Performance Schema truncates its copy of the normalized
  statement digest relative to the original, it does not
  recompute the SHA-256 hash value.)

Statement normalization transforms the statement text to a more
standardized digest string representation that preserves the
general statement structure while removing information not
essential to the structure:

- Object identifiers such as database and table names are
  preserved.
- Literal values are converted to parameter markers. A
  normalized statement does not retain information such as
  names, passwords, dates, and so forth.
- Comments are removed and whitespace is adjusted.

Consider these statements:

```sql
SELECT * FROM orders WHERE customer_id=10 AND quantity>20
SELECT * FROM orders WHERE customer_id = 20 AND quantity > 100
```

To normalize these statements, the parser replaces data values
by `?` and adjusts whitespace. Both statements
yield the same normalized form and thus are considered
“the same”:

```sql
SELECT * FROM orders WHERE customer_id = ? AND quantity > ?
```

The normalized statement contains less information but is still
representative of the original statement. Other similar
statements that have different data values have the same
normalized form.

Now consider these statements:

```sql
SELECT * FROM customers WHERE customer_id = 1000
SELECT * FROM orders WHERE customer_id = 1000
```

In this case, the normalized statements differ because the
object identifiers differ:

```sql
SELECT * FROM customers WHERE customer_id = ?
SELECT * FROM orders WHERE customer_id = ?
```

If normalization produces a statement that exceeds the space
available in the digest buffer (as determined by
[`max_digest_length`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_max_digest_length)), truncation
occurs and the text ends with “...”. Long
normalized statements that differ only in the part that occurs
following the “...” are considered the same.
Consider these statements:

```sql
SELECT * FROM mytable WHERE cola = 10 AND colb = 20
SELECT * FROM mytable WHERE cola = 10 AND colc = 20
```

If the cutoff happens to be right after the
`AND`, both statements have this normalized
form:

```sql
SELECT * FROM mytable WHERE cola = ? AND ...
```

In this case, the difference in the second column name is lost
and both statements are considered the same.

### Statement Digests in the Performance Schema

In the Performance Schema, statement digesting involves these
elements:

- A `statements_digest` consumer in the
  [`setup_consumers`](performance-schema-setup-consumers-table.md "29.12.2.2 The setup_consumers Table") table controls
  whether the Performance Schema maintains digest information.
  See
  [Statement Digest Consumer](performance-schema-consumer-filtering.md#performance-schema-consumer-filtering-statement-digest "Statement Digest Consumer").
- The statement event tables
  ([`events_statements_current`](performance-schema-events-statements-current-table.md "29.12.6.1 The events_statements_current Table"),
  [`events_statements_history`](performance-schema-events-statements-history-table.md "29.12.6.2 The events_statements_history Table"), and
  [`events_statements_history_long`](performance-schema-events-statements-history-long-table.md "29.12.6.3 The events_statements_history_long Table"))
  have columns for storing normalized statement digests and
  the corresponding digest SHA-256 hash values:

  - `DIGEST_TEXT` is the text of the
    normalized statement digest. This is a copy of the
    original normalized statement that was computed to a
    maximum of
    [`max_digest_length`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_max_digest_length)
    bytes, further truncated as necessary to
    [`performance_schema_max_digest_length`](performance-schema-system-variables.md#sysvar_performance_schema_max_digest_length)
    bytes.
  - `DIGEST` is the digest SHA-256 hash
    value computed from the original normalized statement.

  See [Section 29.12.6, “Performance Schema Statement Event Tables”](performance-schema-statement-tables.md "29.12.6 Performance Schema Statement Event Tables").
- The
  [`events_statements_summary_by_digest`](performance-schema-statement-summary-tables.md "29.12.20.3 Statement Summary Tables")
  summary table provides aggregated statement digest
  information. This table aggregates information for
  statements per `SCHEMA_NAME` and
  `DIGEST` combination. The Performance
  Schema uses SHA-256 hash values for aggregation because they
  are fast to compute and have a favorable statistical
  distribution that minimizes collisions. See
  [Section 29.12.20.3, “Statement Summary Tables”](performance-schema-statement-summary-tables.md "29.12.20.3 Statement Summary Tables").

Some Performance Tables have a column that stores original SQL
statements from which digests are computed:

- The `SQL_TEXT` column of the
  [`events_statements_current`](performance-schema-events-statements-current-table.md "29.12.6.1 The events_statements_current Table"),
  [`events_statements_history`](performance-schema-events-statements-history-table.md "29.12.6.2 The events_statements_history Table"), and
  [`events_statements_history_long`](performance-schema-events-statements-history-long-table.md "29.12.6.3 The events_statements_history_long Table")
  statement event tables.
- The `QUERY_SAMPLE_TEXT` column of the
  [`events_statements_summary_by_digest`](performance-schema-statement-summary-tables.md "29.12.20.3 Statement Summary Tables")
  summary table.

The maximum space available for statement display is 1024 bytes
by default. To change this value, set the
[`performance_schema_max_sql_text_length`](performance-schema-system-variables.md#sysvar_performance_schema_max_sql_text_length)
system variable at server startup. Changes affect the storage
required for all the columns just named.

The
[`performance_schema_max_digest_length`](performance-schema-system-variables.md#sysvar_performance_schema_max_digest_length)
system variable determines the maximum number of bytes available
per statement for digest value storage in the Performance
Schema. However, the display length of statement digests may be
longer than the available buffer size due to internal encoding
of statement elements such as keywords and literal values.
Consequently, values selected from the
`DIGEST_TEXT` column of statement event tables
may appear to exceed the
[`performance_schema_max_digest_length`](performance-schema-system-variables.md#sysvar_performance_schema_max_digest_length)
value.

The
[`events_statements_summary_by_digest`](performance-schema-statement-summary-tables.md "29.12.20.3 Statement Summary Tables")
summary table provides a profile of the statements executed by
the server. It shows what kinds of statements an application is
executing and how often. An application developer can use this
information together with other information in the table to
assess the application's performance characteristics. For
example, table columns that show wait times, lock times, or
index use may highlight types of queries that are inefficient.
This gives the developer insight into which parts of the
application need attention.

The
[`events_statements_summary_by_digest`](performance-schema-statement-summary-tables.md "29.12.20.3 Statement Summary Tables")
summary table has a fixed size. By default the Performance
Schema estimates the size to use at startup. To specify the
table size explicitly, set the
[`performance_schema_digests_size`](performance-schema-system-variables.md#sysvar_performance_schema_digests_size)
system variable at server startup. If the table becomes full,
the Performance Schema groups statements that have
`SCHEMA_NAME` and `DIGEST`
values not matching existing values in the table in a special
row with `SCHEMA_NAME` and
`DIGEST` set to `NULL`. This
permits all statements to be counted. However, if the special
row accounts for a significant percentage of the statements
executed, it might be desirable to increase the summary table
size by increasing
[`performance_schema_digests_size`](performance-schema-system-variables.md#sysvar_performance_schema_digests_size).

### Statement Digest Memory Use

For applications that generate very long statements that differ
only at the end, increasing
[`max_digest_length`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_max_digest_length) enables
computation of digests that distinguish statements that would
otherwise aggregate to the same digest. Conversely, decreasing
[`max_digest_length`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_max_digest_length) causes the
server to devote less memory to digest storage but increases the
likelihood of longer statements aggregating to the same digest.
Administrators should keep in mind that larger values result in
correspondingly increased memory requirements, particularly for
workloads that involve large numbers of simultaneous sessions
(the server allocates
[`max_digest_length`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_max_digest_length) bytes per
session).

As described previously, normalized statement digests as
computed by the parser are constrained to a maximum of
[`max_digest_length`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_max_digest_length) bytes,
whereas normalized statement digests stored in the Performance
Schema use
[`performance_schema_max_digest_length`](performance-schema-system-variables.md#sysvar_performance_schema_max_digest_length)
bytes. The following memory-use considerations apply regarding
the relative values of
[`max_digest_length`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_max_digest_length) and
[`performance_schema_max_digest_length`](performance-schema-system-variables.md#sysvar_performance_schema_max_digest_length):

- If [`max_digest_length`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_max_digest_length) is
  less than
  [`performance_schema_max_digest_length`](performance-schema-system-variables.md#sysvar_performance_schema_max_digest_length):

  - Server features other than the Performance Schema use
    normalized statement digests that take up to
    [`max_digest_length`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_max_digest_length)
    bytes.
  - The Performance Schema does not further truncate
    normalized statement digests that it stores, but
    allocates more memory than
    [`max_digest_length`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_max_digest_length) bytes
    per digest, which is unnecessary.
- If [`max_digest_length`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_max_digest_length) equals
  [`performance_schema_max_digest_length`](performance-schema-system-variables.md#sysvar_performance_schema_max_digest_length):

  - Server features other than the Performance Schema use
    normalized statement digests that take up to
    [`max_digest_length`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_max_digest_length)
    bytes.
  - The Performance Schema does not further truncate
    normalized statement digests that it stores, and
    allocates the same amount of memory as
    [`max_digest_length`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_max_digest_length) bytes
    per digest.
- If [`max_digest_length`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_max_digest_length) is
  greater than
  [`performance_schema_max_digest_length`](performance-schema-system-variables.md#sysvar_performance_schema_max_digest_length):

  - Server features other than the Performance Schema use
    normalized statement digests that take up to
    [`max_digest_length`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_max_digest_length)
    bytes.
  - The Performance Schema further truncates normalized
    statement digests that it stores, and allocates less
    memory than
    [`max_digest_length`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_max_digest_length) bytes
    per digest.

Because the Performance Schema statement event tables might
store many digests, setting
[`performance_schema_max_digest_length`](performance-schema-system-variables.md#sysvar_performance_schema_max_digest_length)
smaller than [`max_digest_length`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_max_digest_length)
enables administrators to balance these factors:

- The need to have long normalized statement digests available
  to server features outside the Performance Schema
- Many concurrent sessions, each of which allocates
  digest-computation memory
- The need to limit memory consumption by the Performance
  Schema statement event tables when storing many statement
  digests

The
[`performance_schema_max_digest_length`](performance-schema-system-variables.md#sysvar_performance_schema_max_digest_length)
setting is not per session, it is per statement, and a session
can store multiple statements in the
[`events_statements_history`](performance-schema-events-statements-history-table.md "29.12.6.2 The events_statements_history Table") table. A
typical number of statements in this table is 10 per session, so
each session consumes 10 times the memory indicated by the
[`performance_schema_max_digest_length`](performance-schema-system-variables.md#sysvar_performance_schema_max_digest_length)
value, for this table alone.

Also, there are many statements (and digests) collected
globally, most notably in the
[`events_statements_history_long`](performance-schema-events-statements-history-long-table.md "29.12.6.3 The events_statements_history_long Table")
table. Here, too, *`N`* statements stored
consumes *`N`* times the memory indicated
by the
[`performance_schema_max_digest_length`](performance-schema-system-variables.md#sysvar_performance_schema_max_digest_length)
value.

To assess the amount of memory used for SQL statement storage
and digest computation, use the
[`SHOW ENGINE
PERFORMANCE_SCHEMA STATUS`](show-engine.md "15.7.7.15 SHOW ENGINE Statement") statement, or monitor these
instruments:

```sql
mysql> SELECT NAME
       FROM performance_schema.setup_instruments
       WHERE NAME LIKE '%.sqltext';
+------------------------------------------------------------------+
| NAME                                                             |
+------------------------------------------------------------------+
| memory/performance_schema/events_statements_history.sqltext      |
| memory/performance_schema/events_statements_current.sqltext      |
| memory/performance_schema/events_statements_history_long.sqltext |
+------------------------------------------------------------------+

mysql> SELECT NAME
       FROM performance_schema.setup_instruments
       WHERE NAME LIKE 'memory/performance_schema/%.tokens';
+----------------------------------------------------------------------+
| NAME                                                                 |
+----------------------------------------------------------------------+
| memory/performance_schema/events_statements_history.tokens           |
| memory/performance_schema/events_statements_current.tokens           |
| memory/performance_schema/events_statements_summary_by_digest.tokens |
| memory/performance_schema/events_statements_history_long.tokens      |
+----------------------------------------------------------------------+
```

### Statement Sampling

The Performance Schema uses statement sampling to collect
representative statements that produce each digest value in the
[`events_statements_summary_by_digest`](performance-schema-statement-summary-tables.md "29.12.20.3 Statement Summary Tables")
table. These columns store sample statement information:
`QUERY_SAMPLE_TEXT` (the text of the
statement), `QUERY_SAMPLE_SEEN` (when the
statement was seen), and
`QUERY_SAMPLE_TIMER_WAIT` (the statement wait
or execution time). The Performance Schema updates all three
columns each time it chooses a sample statement.

When a new table row is inserted, the statement that produced
the row digest value is stored as the current sample statement
associated with the digest. Thereafter, when the server sees
other statements with the same digest value, it determines
whether to use the new statement to replace the current sample
statement (that is, whether to resample). Resampling policy is
based on the comparative wait times of the current sample
statement and new statement and, optionally, the age of the
current sample statement:

- Resampling based on wait times: If the new statement wait
  time has a wait time greater than that of the current sample
  statement, it becomes the current sample statement.
- Resampling based on age: If the
  [`performance_schema_max_digest_sample_age`](performance-schema-system-variables.md#sysvar_performance_schema_max_digest_sample_age)
  system variable has a value greater than zero and the
  current sample statement is more than that many seconds old,
  the current statement is considered “too old”
  and the new statement replaces it. This occurs even if the
  new statement wait time is less than that of the current
  sample statement.

By default,
[`performance_schema_max_digest_sample_age`](performance-schema-system-variables.md#sysvar_performance_schema_max_digest_sample_age)
is 60 seconds (1 minute). To change how quickly sample
statements “expire” due to age, increase or
decrease the value. To disable the age-based part of the
resampling policy, set
[`performance_schema_max_digest_sample_age`](performance-schema-system-variables.md#sysvar_performance_schema_max_digest_sample_age)
to 0.
