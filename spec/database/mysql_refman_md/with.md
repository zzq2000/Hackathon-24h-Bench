### 15.2.20 WITH (Common Table Expressions)

A common table expression (CTE) is a named temporary result set
that exists within the scope of a single statement and that can be
referred to later within that statement, possibly multiple times.
The following discussion describes how to write statements that
use CTEs.

#### Common Table Expressions

To specify common table expressions, use a
[`WITH`](with.md "15.2.20 WITH (Common Table Expressions)") clause that has one or more
comma-separated subclauses. Each subclause provides a subquery
that produces a result set, and associates a name with the
subquery. The following example defines CTEs named
`cte1` and `cte2` in the
[`WITH`](with.md "15.2.20 WITH (Common Table Expressions)") clause, and refers to them
in the top-level [`SELECT`](select.md "15.2.13 SELECT Statement") that
follows the [`WITH`](with.md "15.2.20 WITH (Common Table Expressions)") clause:

```sql
WITH
  cte1 AS (SELECT a, b FROM table1),
  cte2 AS (SELECT c, d FROM table2)
SELECT b, d FROM cte1 JOIN cte2
WHERE cte1.a = cte2.c;
```

In the statement containing the
[`WITH`](with.md "15.2.20 WITH (Common Table Expressions)") clause, each CTE name can be
referenced to access the corresponding CTE result set.

A CTE name can be referenced in other CTEs, enabling CTEs to be
defined based on other CTEs.

A CTE can refer to itself to define a recursive CTE. Common
applications of recursive CTEs include series generation and
traversal of hierarchical or tree-structured data.

Common table expressions are an optional part of the syntax for
DML statements. They are defined using a
[`WITH`](with.md "15.2.20 WITH (Common Table Expressions)") clause:

```sql
with_clause:
    WITH [RECURSIVE]
        cte_name [(col_name [, col_name] ...)] AS (subquery)
        [, cte_name [(col_name [, col_name] ...)] AS (subquery)] ...
```

*`cte_name`* names a single common table
expression and can be used as a table reference in the statement
containing the [`WITH`](with.md "15.2.20 WITH (Common Table Expressions)") clause.

The *`subquery`* part of `AS
(subquery)` is called the
“subquery of the CTE” and is what produces the CTE
result set. The parentheses following `AS` are
required.

A common table expression is recursive if its subquery refers to
its own name. The `RECURSIVE` keyword must be
included if any CTE in the [`WITH`](with.md "15.2.20 WITH (Common Table Expressions)")
clause is recursive. For more information, see
[Recursive Common Table Expressions](with.md#common-table-expressions-recursive "Recursive Common Table Expressions").

Determination of column names for a given CTE occurs as follows:

- If a parenthesized list of names follows the CTE name, those
  names are the column names:

  ```sql
  WITH cte (col1, col2) AS
  (
    SELECT 1, 2
    UNION ALL
    SELECT 3, 4
  )
  SELECT col1, col2 FROM cte;
  ```

  The number of names in the list must be the same as the
  number of columns in the result set.
- Otherwise, the column names come from the select list of the
  first [`SELECT`](select.md "15.2.13 SELECT Statement") within the
  `AS (subquery)`
  part:

  ```sql
  WITH cte AS
  (
    SELECT 1 AS col1, 2 AS col2
    UNION ALL
    SELECT 3, 4
  )
  SELECT col1, col2 FROM cte;
  ```

A [`WITH`](with.md "15.2.20 WITH (Common Table Expressions)") clause is permitted in
these contexts:

- At the beginning of [`SELECT`](select.md "15.2.13 SELECT Statement"),
  [`UPDATE`](update.md "15.2.17 UPDATE Statement"), and
  [`DELETE`](delete.md "15.2.2 DELETE Statement") statements.

  ```sql
  WITH ... SELECT ...
  WITH ... UPDATE ...
  WITH ... DELETE ...
  ```
- At the beginning of subqueries (including derived table
  subqueries):

  ```sql
  SELECT ... WHERE id IN (WITH ... SELECT ...) ...
  SELECT * FROM (WITH ... SELECT ...) AS dt ...
  ```
- Immediately preceding [`SELECT`](select.md "15.2.13 SELECT Statement")
  for statements that include a
  [`SELECT`](select.md "15.2.13 SELECT Statement") statement:

  ```sql
  INSERT ... WITH ... SELECT ...
  REPLACE ... WITH ... SELECT ...
  CREATE TABLE ... WITH ... SELECT ...
  CREATE VIEW ... WITH ... SELECT ...
  DECLARE CURSOR ... WITH ... SELECT ...
  EXPLAIN ... WITH ... SELECT ...
  ```

Only one [`WITH`](with.md "15.2.20 WITH (Common Table Expressions)") clause is permitted
at the same level. [`WITH`](with.md "15.2.20 WITH (Common Table Expressions)") followed
by [`WITH`](with.md "15.2.20 WITH (Common Table Expressions)") at the same level is not
permitted, so this is illegal:

```sql
WITH cte1 AS (...) WITH cte2 AS (...) SELECT ...
```

To make the statement legal, use a single
[`WITH`](with.md "15.2.20 WITH (Common Table Expressions)") clause that separates the
subclauses by a comma:

```sql
WITH cte1 AS (...), cte2 AS (...) SELECT ...
```

However, a statement can contain multiple
[`WITH`](with.md "15.2.20 WITH (Common Table Expressions)") clauses if they occur at
different levels:

```sql
WITH cte1 AS (SELECT 1)
SELECT * FROM (WITH cte2 AS (SELECT 2) SELECT * FROM cte2 JOIN cte1) AS dt;
```

A [`WITH`](with.md "15.2.20 WITH (Common Table Expressions)") clause can define one or
more common table expressions, but each CTE name must be unique
to the clause. This is illegal:

```sql
WITH cte1 AS (...), cte1 AS (...) SELECT ...
```

To make the statement legal, define the CTEs with unique names:

```sql
WITH cte1 AS (...), cte2 AS (...) SELECT ...
```

A CTE can refer to itself or to other CTEs:

- A self-referencing CTE is recursive.
- A CTE can refer to CTEs defined earlier in the same
  [`WITH`](with.md "15.2.20 WITH (Common Table Expressions)") clause, but not those
  defined later.

  This constraint rules out mutually-recursive CTEs, where
  `cte1` references `cte2`
  and `cte2` references
  `cte1`. One of those references must be to
  a CTE defined later, which is not permitted.
- A CTE in a given query block can refer to CTEs defined in
  query blocks at a more outer level, but not CTEs defined in
  query blocks at a more inner level.

For resolving references to objects with the same names, derived
tables hide CTEs; and CTEs hide base tables,
`TEMPORARY` tables, and views. Name resolution
occurs by searching for objects in the same query block, then
proceeding to outer blocks in turn while no object with the name
is found.

Like derived tables, a CTE cannot contain outer references prior
to MySQL 8.0.14. This is a MySQL restriction that is lifted in
MySQL 8.0.14, not a restriction of the SQL standard. For
additional syntax considerations specific to recursive CTEs, see
[Recursive Common Table Expressions](with.md#common-table-expressions-recursive "Recursive Common Table Expressions").

#### Recursive Common Table Expressions

A recursive common table expression is one having a subquery
that refers to its own name. For example:

```sql
WITH RECURSIVE cte (n) AS
(
  SELECT 1
  UNION ALL
  SELECT n + 1 FROM cte WHERE n < 5
)
SELECT * FROM cte;
```

When executed, the statement produces this result, a single
column containing a simple linear sequence:

```none
+------+
| n    |
+------+
|    1 |
|    2 |
|    3 |
|    4 |
|    5 |
+------+
```

A recursive CTE has this structure:

- The `WITH` clause must begin with
  `WITH RECURSIVE` if any CTE in the
  `WITH` clause refers to itself. (If no CTE
  refers to itself, `RECURSIVE` is permitted
  but not required.)

  If you forget `RECURSIVE` for a recursive
  CTE, this error is a likely result:

  ```none
  ERROR 1146 (42S02): Table 'cte_name' doesn't exist
  ```
- The recursive CTE subquery has two parts, separated by
  [`UNION ALL`](union.md "15.2.18 UNION Clause")
  or [`UNION
  [DISTINCT]`](union.md "15.2.18 UNION Clause"):

  ```sql
  SELECT ...      -- return initial row set
  UNION ALL
  SELECT ...      -- return additional row sets
  ```

  The first [`SELECT`](select.md "15.2.13 SELECT Statement") produces the
  initial row or rows for the CTE and does not refer to the
  CTE name. The second [`SELECT`](select.md "15.2.13 SELECT Statement")
  produces additional rows and recurses by referring to the
  CTE name in its `FROM` clause. Recursion
  ends when this part produces no new rows. Thus, a recursive
  CTE consists of a nonrecursive
  [`SELECT`](select.md "15.2.13 SELECT Statement") part followed by a
  recursive [`SELECT`](select.md "15.2.13 SELECT Statement") part.

  Each [`SELECT`](select.md "15.2.13 SELECT Statement") part can itself
  be a union of multiple [`SELECT`](select.md "15.2.13 SELECT Statement")
  statements.
- The types of the CTE result columns are inferred from the
  column types of the nonrecursive
  [`SELECT`](select.md "15.2.13 SELECT Statement") part only, and the
  columns are all nullable. For type determination, the
  recursive [`SELECT`](select.md "15.2.13 SELECT Statement") part is
  ignored.
- If the nonrecursive and recursive parts are separated by
  [`UNION
  DISTINCT`](union.md "15.2.18 UNION Clause"), duplicate rows are eliminated. This is
  useful for queries that perform transitive closures, to
  avoid infinite loops.
- Each iteration of the recursive part operates only on the
  rows produced by the previous iteration. If the recursive
  part has multiple query blocks, iterations of each query
  block are scheduled in unspecified order, and each query
  block operates on rows that have been produced either by its
  previous iteration or by other query blocks since that
  previous iteration's end.

The recursive CTE subquery shown earlier has this nonrecursive
part that retrieves a single row to produce the initial row set:

```sql
SELECT 1
```

The CTE subquery also has this recursive part:

```sql
SELECT n + 1 FROM cte WHERE n < 5
```

At each iteration, that [`SELECT`](select.md "15.2.13 SELECT Statement")
produces a row with a new value one greater than the value of
`n` from the previous row set. The first
iteration operates on the initial row set (`1`)
and produces `1+1=2`; the second iteration
operates on the first iteration's row set (`2`)
and produces `2+1=3`; and so forth. This
continues until recursion ends, which occurs when
`n` is no longer less than 5.

If the recursive part of a CTE produces wider values for a
column than the nonrecursive part, it may be necessary to widen
the column in the nonrecursive part to avoid data truncation.
Consider this statement:

```sql
WITH RECURSIVE cte AS
(
  SELECT 1 AS n, 'abc' AS str
  UNION ALL
  SELECT n + 1, CONCAT(str, str) FROM cte WHERE n < 3
)
SELECT * FROM cte;
```

In nonstrict SQL mode, the statement produces this output:

```none
+------+------+
| n    | str  |
+------+------+
|    1 | abc  |
|    2 | abc  |
|    3 | abc  |
+------+------+
```

The `str` column values are all
`'abc'` because the nonrecursive
[`SELECT`](select.md "15.2.13 SELECT Statement") determines the column
widths. Consequently, the wider `str` values
produced by the recursive [`SELECT`](select.md "15.2.13 SELECT Statement")
are truncated.

In strict SQL mode, the statement produces an error:

```none
ERROR 1406 (22001): Data too long for column 'str' at row 1
```

To address this issue, so that the statement does not produce
truncation or errors, use [`CAST()`](cast-functions.md#function_cast)
in the nonrecursive [`SELECT`](select.md "15.2.13 SELECT Statement") to
make the `str` column wider:

```sql
WITH RECURSIVE cte AS
(
  SELECT 1 AS n, CAST('abc' AS CHAR(20)) AS str
  UNION ALL
  SELECT n + 1, CONCAT(str, str) FROM cte WHERE n < 3
)
SELECT * FROM cte;
```

Now the statement produces this result, without truncation:

```none
+------+--------------+
| n    | str          |
+------+--------------+
|    1 | abc          |
|    2 | abcabc       |
|    3 | abcabcabcabc |
+------+--------------+
```

Columns are accessed by name, not position, which means that
columns in the recursive part can access columns in the
nonrecursive part that have a different position, as this CTE
illustrates:

```sql
WITH RECURSIVE cte AS
(
  SELECT 1 AS n, 1 AS p, -1 AS q
  UNION ALL
  SELECT n + 1, q * 2, p * 2 FROM cte WHERE n < 5
)
SELECT * FROM cte;
```

Because `p` in one row is derived from
`q` in the previous row, and vice versa, the
positive and negative values swap positions in each successive
row of the output:

```none
+------+------+------+
| n    | p    | q    |
+------+------+------+
|    1 |    1 |   -1 |
|    2 |   -2 |    2 |
|    3 |    4 |   -4 |
|    4 |   -8 |    8 |
|    5 |   16 |  -16 |
+------+------+------+
```

Some syntax constraints apply within recursive CTE subqueries:

- The recursive [`SELECT`](select.md "15.2.13 SELECT Statement") part
  must not contain these constructs:

  - Aggregate functions such as `SUM()`
  - Window functions
  - `GROUP BY`
  - `ORDER BY`
  - `DISTINCT`

  Prior to MySQL 8.0.19, the recursive
  [`SELECT`](select.md "15.2.13 SELECT Statement") part of a recursive
  CTE also could not use a `LIMIT` clause.
  This restriction is lifted in MySQL 8.0.19, and
  `LIMIT` is now supported in such cases,
  along with an optional `OFFSET` clause. The
  effect on the result set is the same as when using
  `LIMIT` in the outermost
  `SELECT`, but is also more efficient, since
  using it with the recursive `SELECT` stops
  the generation of rows as soon as the requested number of
  them has been produced.

  These constraints do not apply to the nonrecursive
  [`SELECT`](select.md "15.2.13 SELECT Statement") part of a recursive
  CTE. The prohibition on `DISTINCT` applies
  only to [`UNION`](union.md "15.2.18 UNION Clause") members;
  `UNION DISTINCT` is permitted.
- The recursive [`SELECT`](select.md "15.2.13 SELECT Statement") part
  must reference the CTE only once and only in its
  `FROM` clause, not in any subquery. It can
  reference tables other than the CTE and join them with the
  CTE. If used in a join like this, the CTE must not be on the
  right side of a `LEFT JOIN`.

These constraints come from the SQL standard, other than the
MySQL-specific exclusions of `ORDER BY`,
`LIMIT` (MySQL 8.0.18 and earlier), and
`DISTINCT`.

For recursive CTEs, [`EXPLAIN`](explain.md "15.8.2 EXPLAIN Statement")
output rows for recursive [`SELECT`](select.md "15.2.13 SELECT Statement")
parts display `Recursive` in the
`Extra` column.

Cost estimates displayed by
[`EXPLAIN`](explain.md "15.8.2 EXPLAIN Statement") represent cost per
iteration, which might differ considerably from total cost. The
optimizer cannot predict the number of iterations because it
cannot predict at what point the `WHERE` clause
becomes false.

CTE actual cost may also be affected by result set size. A CTE
that produces many rows may require an internal temporary table
large enough to be converted from in-memory to on-disk format
and may suffer a performance penalty. If so, increasing the
permitted in-memory temporary table size may improve
performance; see [Section 10.4.4, “Internal Temporary Table Use in MySQL”](internal-temporary-tables.md "10.4.4 Internal Temporary Table Use in MySQL").

#### Limiting Common Table Expression Recursion

It is important for recursive CTEs that the recursive
[`SELECT`](select.md "15.2.13 SELECT Statement") part include a condition
to terminate recursion. As a development technique to guard
against a runaway recursive CTE, you can force termination by
placing a limit on execution time:

- The [`cte_max_recursion_depth`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_cte_max_recursion_depth)
  system variable enforces a limit on the number of recursion
  levels for CTEs. The server terminates execution of any CTE
  that recurses more levels than the value of this variable.
- The [`max_execution_time`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_max_execution_time)
  system variable enforces an execution timeout for
  [`SELECT`](select.md "15.2.13 SELECT Statement") statements executed
  within the current session.
- The [`MAX_EXECUTION_TIME`](optimizer-hints.md#optimizer-hints-execution-time "Statement Execution Time Optimizer Hints")
  optimizer hint enforces a per-query execution timeout for
  the [`SELECT`](select.md "15.2.13 SELECT Statement") statement in which
  it appears.

Suppose that a recursive CTE is mistakenly written with no
recursion execution termination condition:

```sql
WITH RECURSIVE cte (n) AS
(
  SELECT 1
  UNION ALL
  SELECT n + 1 FROM cte
)
SELECT * FROM cte;
```

By default,
[`cte_max_recursion_depth`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_cte_max_recursion_depth) has a
value of 1000, causing the CTE to terminate when it recurses
past 1000 levels. Applications can change the session value to
adjust for their requirements:

```sql
SET SESSION cte_max_recursion_depth = 10;      -- permit only shallow recursion
SET SESSION cte_max_recursion_depth = 1000000; -- permit deeper recursion
```

You can also set the global
[`cte_max_recursion_depth`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_cte_max_recursion_depth) value
to affect all sessions that begin subsequently.

For queries that execute and thus recurse slowly or in contexts
for which there is reason to set the
[`cte_max_recursion_depth`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_cte_max_recursion_depth) value
very high, another way to guard against deep recursion is to set
a per-session timeout. To do so, execute a statement like this
prior to executing the CTE statement:

```sql
SET max_execution_time = 1000; -- impose one second timeout
```

Alternatively, include an optimizer hint within the CTE
statement itself:

```sql
WITH RECURSIVE cte (n) AS
(
  SELECT 1
  UNION ALL
  SELECT n + 1 FROM cte
)
SELECT /*+ SET_VAR(cte_max_recursion_depth = 1M) */ * FROM cte;

WITH RECURSIVE cte (n) AS
(
  SELECT 1
  UNION ALL
  SELECT n + 1 FROM cte
)
SELECT /*+ MAX_EXECUTION_TIME(1000) */ * FROM cte;
```

Beginning with MySQL 8.0.19, you can also use
`LIMIT` within the recursive query to impose a
maximum number of rows to be returned to the outermost
[`SELECT`](select.md "15.2.13 SELECT Statement"), for example:

```sql
WITH RECURSIVE cte (n) AS
(
  SELECT 1
  UNION ALL
  SELECT n + 1 FROM cte LIMIT 10000
)
SELECT * FROM cte;
```

You can do this in addition to or instead of setting a time
limit. Thus, the following CTE terminates after returning ten
thousand rows or running for one second (1000 milliseconds),
whichever occurs first:

```sql
WITH RECURSIVE cte (n) AS
(
  SELECT 1
  UNION ALL
  SELECT n + 1 FROM cte LIMIT 10000
)
SELECT /*+ MAX_EXECUTION_TIME(1000) */ * FROM cte;
```

If a recursive query without an execution time limit enters an
infinite loop, you can terminate it from another session using
[`KILL QUERY`](kill.md "15.7.8.4 KILL Statement").
Within the session itself, the client program used to run the
query might provide a way to kill the query. For example, in
[**mysql**](mysql.md "6.5.1 mysql — The MySQL Command-Line Client"), typing **Control+C**
interrupts the current statement.

#### Recursive Common Table Expression Examples

As mentioned previously, recursive common table expressions
(CTEs) are frequently used for series generation and traversing
hierarchical or tree-structured data. This section shows some
simple examples of these techniques.

- [Fibonacci Series Generation](with.md#common-table-expressions-recursive-fibonacci-series "Fibonacci Series Generation")
- [Date Series Generation](with.md#common-table-expressions-recursive-date-series "Date Series Generation")
- [Hierarchical Data Traversal](with.md#common-table-expressions-recursive-hierarchy-traversal "Hierarchical Data Traversal")

##### Fibonacci Series Generation

A Fibonacci series begins with the two numbers 0 and 1 (or 1 and
1) and each number after that is the sum of the previous two
numbers. A recursive common table expression can generate a
Fibonacci series if each row produced by the recursive
[`SELECT`](select.md "15.2.13 SELECT Statement") has access to the two
previous numbers from the series. The following CTE generates a
10-number series using 0 and 1 as the first two numbers:

```sql
WITH RECURSIVE fibonacci (n, fib_n, next_fib_n) AS
(
  SELECT 1, 0, 1
  UNION ALL
  SELECT n + 1, next_fib_n, fib_n + next_fib_n
    FROM fibonacci WHERE n < 10
)
SELECT * FROM fibonacci;
```

The CTE produces this result:

```none
+------+-------+------------+
| n    | fib_n | next_fib_n |
+------+-------+------------+
|    1 |     0 |          1 |
|    2 |     1 |          1 |
|    3 |     1 |          2 |
|    4 |     2 |          3 |
|    5 |     3 |          5 |
|    6 |     5 |          8 |
|    7 |     8 |         13 |
|    8 |    13 |         21 |
|    9 |    21 |         34 |
|   10 |    34 |         55 |
+------+-------+------------+
```

How the CTE works:

- `n` is a display column to indicate that
  the row contains the `n`-th Fibonacci
  number. For example, the 8th Fibonacci number is 13.
- The `fib_n` column displays Fibonacci
  number `n`.
- The `next_fib_n` column displays the next
  Fibonacci number after number `n`. This
  column provides the next series value to the next row, so
  that row can produce the sum of the two previous series
  values in its `fib_n` column.
- Recursion ends when `n` reaches 10. This is
  an arbitrary choice, to limit the output to a small set of
  rows.

The preceding output shows the entire CTE result. To select just
part of it, add an appropriate `WHERE` clause
to the top-level [`SELECT`](select.md "15.2.13 SELECT Statement"). For
example, to select the 8th Fibonacci number, do this:

```sql
mysql> WITH RECURSIVE fibonacci ...
       ...
       SELECT fib_n FROM fibonacci WHERE n = 8;
+-------+
| fib_n |
+-------+
|    13 |
+-------+
```

##### Date Series Generation

A common table expression can generate a series of successive
dates, which is useful for generating summaries that include a
row for all dates in the series, including dates not represented
in the summarized data.

Suppose that a table of sales numbers contains these rows:

```sql
mysql> SELECT * FROM sales ORDER BY date, price;
+------------+--------+
| date       | price  |
+------------+--------+
| 2017-01-03 | 100.00 |
| 2017-01-03 | 200.00 |
| 2017-01-06 |  50.00 |
| 2017-01-08 |  10.00 |
| 2017-01-08 |  20.00 |
| 2017-01-08 | 150.00 |
| 2017-01-10 |   5.00 |
+------------+--------+
```

This query summarizes the sales per day:

```sql
mysql> SELECT date, SUM(price) AS sum_price
       FROM sales
       GROUP BY date
       ORDER BY date;
+------------+-----------+
| date       | sum_price |
+------------+-----------+
| 2017-01-03 |    300.00 |
| 2017-01-06 |     50.00 |

However, that result contains “holes” for dates not
represented in the range of dates spanned by the table. A result
that represents all dates in the range can be produced using a
recursive CTE to generate that set of dates, joined with a
`LEFT JOIN` to the sales data.

Here is the CTE to generate the date range series:

```sql
WITH RECURSIVE dates (date) AS
(
  SELECT MIN(date) FROM sales
  UNION ALL
  SELECT date + INTERVAL 1 DAY FROM dates
  WHERE date + INTERVAL 1 DAY <= (SELECT MAX(date) FROM sales)
)
SELECT * FROM dates;
```

The CTE produces this result:

```none
+------------+
| date       |
+------------+
| 2017-01-03 |
| 2017-01-04 |
| 2017-01-05 |
| 2017-01-06 |
| 2017-01-07 |
| 2017-01-08 |
| 2017-01-09 |
| 2017-01-10 |
+------------+
```

How the CTE works:

- The nonrecursive [`SELECT`](select.md "15.2.13 SELECT Statement")
  produces the lowest date in the date range spanned by the
  `sales` table.
- Each row produced by the recursive
  [`SELECT`](select.md "15.2.13 SELECT Statement") adds one day to the
  date produced by the previous row.
- Recursion ends after the dates reach the highest date in the
  date range spanned by the `sales` table.

Joining the CTE with a `LEFT JOIN` against the
`sales` table produces the sales summary with a
row for each date in the range:

```sql
WITH RECURSIVE dates (date) AS
(
  SELECT MIN(date) FROM sales
  UNION ALL
  SELECT date + INTERVAL 1 DAY FROM dates
  WHERE date + INTERVAL 1 DAY <= (SELECT MAX(date) FROM sales)
)
SELECT dates.date, COALESCE(SUM(price), 0) AS sum_price
FROM dates LEFT JOIN sales ON dates.date = sales.date
GROUP BY dates.date
ORDER BY dates.date;
```

The output looks like this:

```none
+------------+-----------+
| date       | sum_price |
+------------+-----------+
| 2017-01-03 |    300.00 |
| 2017-01-04 |      0.00 |
| 2017-01-05 |      0.00 |
| 2017-01-06 |     50.00 |
| 2017-01-07 |      0.00 |
| 2017-01-08 |    180.00 |
| 2017-01-09 |      0.00 |
| 2017-01-10 |      5.00 |
+------------+-----------+
```

Some points to note:

- Are the queries inefficient, particularly the one with the
  [`MAX()`](aggregate-functions.md#function_max) subquery executed for
  each row in the recursive
  [`SELECT`](select.md "15.2.13 SELECT Statement")?
  [`EXPLAIN`](explain.md "15.8.2 EXPLAIN Statement") shows that the
  subquery containing [`MAX()`](aggregate-functions.md#function_max) is
  evaluated only once and the result is cached.
- The use of [`COALESCE()`](comparison-operators.md#function_coalesce) avoids
  displaying `NULL` in the
  `sum_price` column on days for which no
  sales data occur in the `sales` table.

##### Hierarchical Data Traversal

Recursive common table expressions are useful for traversing
data that forms a hierarchy. Consider these statements that
create a small data set that shows, for each employee in a
company, the employee name and ID number, and the ID of the
employee's manager. The top-level employee (the CEO), has a
manager ID of `NULL` (no manager).

```sql
CREATE TABLE employees (
  id         INT PRIMARY KEY NOT NULL,
  name       VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
  manager_id INT NULL,
  INDEX (manager_id),
FOREIGN KEY (manager_id) REFERENCES employees (id)
);
INSERT INTO employees VALUES
(333, "Yasmina", NULL),  # Yasmina is the CEO (manager_id is NULL)
(198, "John", 333),      # John has ID 198 and reports to 333 (Yasmina)
(692, "Tarek", 333),
(29, "Pedro", 198),
(4610, "Sarah", 29),
(72, "Pierre", 29),
(123, "Adil", 692);
```

The resulting data set looks like this:

```sql
mysql> SELECT * FROM employees ORDER BY id;
+------+---------+------------+
| id   | name    | manager_id |
+------+---------+------------+
|   29 | Pedro   |        198 |
|   72 | Pierre  |         29 |
|  123 | Adil    |        692 |
|  198 | John    |        333 |
|  333 | Yasmina |       NULL |
|  692 | Tarek   |        333 |
| 4610 | Sarah   |         29 |
+------+---------+------------+
```

To produce the organizational chart with the management chain
for each employee (that is, the path from CEO to employee), use
a recursive CTE:

```sql
WITH RECURSIVE employee_paths (id, name, path) AS
(
  SELECT id, name, CAST(id AS CHAR(200))
    FROM employees
    WHERE manager_id IS NULL
  UNION ALL
  SELECT e.id, e.name, CONCAT(ep.path, ',', e.id)
    FROM employee_paths AS ep JOIN employees AS e
      ON ep.id = e.manager_id
)
SELECT * FROM employee_paths ORDER BY path;
```

The CTE produces this output:

```none
+------+---------+-----------------+
| id   | name    | path            |
+------+---------+-----------------+
|  333 | Yasmina | 333             |
|  198 | John    | 333,198         |
|   29 | Pedro   | 333,198,29      |
| 4610 | Sarah   | 333,198,29,4610 |
|   72 | Pierre  | 333,198,29,72   |
|  692 | Tarek   | 333,692         |
|  123 | Adil    | 333,692,123     |
+------+---------+-----------------+
```

How the CTE works:

- The nonrecursive [`SELECT`](select.md "15.2.13 SELECT Statement")
  produces the row for the CEO (the row with a
  `NULL` manager ID).

  The `path` column is widened to
  `CHAR(200)` to ensure that there is room
  for the longer `path` values produced by
  the recursive [`SELECT`](select.md "15.2.13 SELECT Statement").
- Each row produced by the recursive
  [`SELECT`](select.md "15.2.13 SELECT Statement") finds all employees
  who report directly to an employee produced by a previous
  row. For each such employee, the row includes the employee
  ID and name, and the employee management chain. The chain is
  the manager's chain, with the employee ID added to the end.
- Recursion ends when employees have no others who report to
  them.

To find the path for a specific employee or employees, add a
`WHERE` clause to the top-level
[`SELECT`](select.md "15.2.13 SELECT Statement"). For example, to display
the results for Tarek and Sarah, modify that
[`SELECT`](select.md "15.2.13 SELECT Statement") like this:

```sql
mysql> WITH RECURSIVE ...
       ...
       SELECT * FROM employees_extended
       WHERE id IN (692, 4610)
       ORDER BY path;
+------+-------+-----------------+
| id   | name  | path            |
+------+-------+-----------------+
| 4610 | Sarah | 333,198,29,4610 |
|  692 | Tarek | 333,692         |
+------+-------+-----------------+
```

#### Common Table Expressions Compared to Similar Constructs

Common table expressions (CTEs) are similar to derived tables in
some ways:

- Both constructs are named.
- Both constructs exist for the scope of a single statement.

Because of these similarities, CTEs and derived tables often can
be used interchangeably. As a trivial example, these statements
are equivalent:

```sql
WITH cte AS (SELECT 1) SELECT * FROM cte;
SELECT * FROM (SELECT 1) AS dt;
```

However, CTEs have some advantages over derived tables:

- A derived table can be referenced only a single time within
  a query. A CTE can be referenced multiple times. To use
  multiple instances of a derived table result, you must
  derive the result multiple times.
- A CTE can be self-referencing (recursive).
- One CTE can refer to another.
- A CTE may be easier to read when its definition appears at
  the beginning of the statement rather than embedded within
  it.

CTEs are similar to tables created with
[`CREATE [TEMPORARY]
TABLE`](create-table.md "15.1.20 CREATE TABLE Statement") but need not be defined or dropped explicitly.
For a CTE, you need no privileges to create tables.
