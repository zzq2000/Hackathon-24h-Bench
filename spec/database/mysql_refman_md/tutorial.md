This chapter provides a tutorial introduction to MySQL by showing
how to use the [**mysql**](mysql.md "6.5.1 mysql — The MySQL Command-Line Client") client program to create and
use a simple database. [**mysql**](mysql.md "6.5.1 mysql — The MySQL Command-Line Client") (sometimes referred
to as the “terminal monitor” or just
“monitor”) is an interactive program that enables you
to connect to a MySQL server, run queries, and view the results.
[**mysql**](mysql.md "6.5.1 mysql — The MySQL Command-Line Client") may also be used in batch mode: you place
your queries in a file beforehand, then tell
[**mysql**](mysql.md "6.5.1 mysql — The MySQL Command-Line Client") to execute the contents of the file. Both
ways of using [**mysql**](mysql.md "6.5.1 mysql — The MySQL Command-Line Client") are covered here.

To see a list of options provided by [**mysql**](mysql.md "6.5.1 mysql — The MySQL Command-Line Client"),
invoke it with the [`--help`](mysql-command-options.md#option_mysql_help) option:

```terminal
$> mysql --help
```

This chapter assumes that [**mysql**](mysql.md "6.5.1 mysql — The MySQL Command-Line Client") is installed on
your machine and that a MySQL server is available to which you can
connect. If this is not true, contact your MySQL administrator. (If
*you* are the administrator, you need to consult
the relevant portions of this manual, such as
[Chapter 7, *MySQL Server Administration*](server-administration.md "Chapter 7 MySQL Server Administration").)

This chapter describes the entire process of setting up and using a
database. If you are interested only in accessing an existing
database, you may want to skip the sections that describe how to
create the database and the tables it contains.

Because this chapter is tutorial in nature, many details are
necessarily omitted. Consult the relevant sections of the manual for
more information on the topics covered here.
