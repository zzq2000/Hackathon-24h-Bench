#### 29.12.11.14 The replication\_group\_member\_actions Table

This table lists the member actions that are included in the
member actions configuration for replication group members.
The table is available only when Group Replication is
installed. You can reset the member actions configuration
using the
[`group_replication_reset_member_actions()`](group-replication-functions-for-member-actions.md#function_group-replication-reset-member-actions)
function. For more information, see
[Section 20.5.1.5, “Configuring Member Actions”](group-replication-member-actions.md "20.5.1.5 Configuring Member Actions").

The `replication_group_member_actions` table
has these columns:

- `NAME`

  The name of the member action.
- `EVENT`

  The event that triggers the member action.
- `ENABLED`

  Whether the member action is currently enabled. Member
  actions can be enabled using the
  [`group_replication_enable_member_action()`](group-replication-functions-for-member-actions.md#function_group-replication-enable-member-action)
  function and disabled using the
  [`group_replication_disable_member_action()`](group-replication-functions-for-member-actions.md#function_group-replication-disable-member-action)
  function.
- `TYPE`

  The type of member action. `INTERNAL` is
  an action that is provided by the Group Replication
  plugin.
- `PRIORITY`

  The priority of the member action. Actions with lower
  priority values are actioned first.
- `ERROR_HANDLING`

  The action that Group Replication takes if an error occurs
  when the member action is being carried out.
  `IGNORE` means that an error message is
  logged to say that the member action failed, but no
  further action is taken. `CRITICAL` means
  that the member moves into `ERROR` state,
  and takes the action specified by the
  [`group_replication_exit_state_action`](group-replication-system-variables.md#sysvar_group_replication_exit_state_action)
  system variable.

The `replication_group_member_actions` table
has no indexes.

[`TRUNCATE TABLE`](truncate-table.md "15.1.37 TRUNCATE TABLE Statement") is not permitted
for the `replication_group_member_actions`
table.
