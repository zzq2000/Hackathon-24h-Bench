#### 25.2.7.5 Limits Associated with Database Objects in NDB Cluster

Some database objects such as tables and indexes have different
limitations when using the
[`NDBCLUSTER`](mysql-cluster.md "Chapter 25 MySQL NDB Cluster 8.0") storage engine:

- **Number of database objects.**
  The maximum number of *all*
  [`NDB`](mysql-cluster.md "Chapter 25 MySQL NDB Cluster 8.0") database objects in a
  single NDB Cluster—including databases, tables, and
  indexes—is limited to 20320.
- **Attributes per table.**
  The maximum number of attributes (that is, columns and
  indexes) that can belong to a given table is 512.
- **Attributes per key.**
  The maximum number of attributes per key is 32.
- **Row size.**
  In NDB 8.0, the maximum permitted size of any one row is
  30000 bytes (increased from 14000 bytes in previous
  releases).

  Each [`BLOB`](blob.md "13.3.4 The BLOB and TEXT Types") or
  [`TEXT`](blob.md "13.3.4 The BLOB and TEXT Types") column contributes 256 +
  8 = 264 bytes to this total; this includes
  [`JSON`](json.md "13.5 The JSON Data Type") columns. See
  [String Type Storage Requirements](storage-requirements.md#data-types-storage-reqs-strings "String Type Storage Requirements"), as well
  as [JSON Storage Requirements](storage-requirements.md#data-types-storage-reqs-json "JSON Storage Requirements"), for more
  information relating to these types.

  In addition, the maximum offset for a fixed-width column of
  an `NDB` table is 8188 bytes; attempting to
  create a table that violates this limitation fails with NDB
  error 851 Maximum offset for fixed-size columns
  exceeded. For memory-based columns, you can work
  around this limitation by using a variable-width column type
  such as [`VARCHAR`](char.md "13.3.2 The CHAR and VARCHAR Types") or defining
  the column as `COLUMN_FORMAT=DYNAMIC`; this
  does not work with columns stored on disk. For disk-based
  columns, you may be able to do so by reordering one or more
  of the table's disk-based columns such that the
  combined width of all but the disk-based column defined last
  in the [`CREATE TABLE`](create-table.md "15.1.20 CREATE TABLE Statement") statement
  used to create the table does not exceed 8188 bytes, less
  any possible rounding performed for some data types such as
  [`CHAR`](char.md "13.3.2 The CHAR and VARCHAR Types") or
  `VARCHAR`; otherwise it is necessary to use
  memory-based storage for one or more of the offending column
  or columns instead.
- **BIT column storage per table.**
  The maximum combined width for all
  [`BIT`](bit-type.md "13.1.5 Bit-Value Type - BIT") columns used in a given
  `NDB` table is 4096.
- **FIXED column storage.**
  NDB Cluster 8.0 supports a maximum of 128 TB per fragment
  of data in `FIXED` columns.
