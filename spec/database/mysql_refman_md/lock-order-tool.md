### 7.9.3 The LOCK\_ORDER Tool

The MySQL server is a multithreaded application that uses numerous
internal locking and lock-related primitives, such as mutexes,
rwlocks (including prlocks and sxlocks), conditions, and files.
Within the server, the set of lock-related objects changes with
implementation of new features and code refactoring for
performance improvements. As with any multithreaded application
that uses locking primitives, there is always a risk of
encountering a deadlock during execution when multiple locks are
held at once. For MySQL, the effect of a deadlock is catastrophic,
causing a complete loss of service.

As of MySQL 8.0.17, to enable detection of lock-acquisition
deadlocks and enforcement that runtime execution is free of them,
MySQL supports `LOCK_ORDER` tooling. This enables
a lock-order dependency graph to be defined as part of server
design, and server runtime checking to ensure that lock
acquisition is acyclic and that execution paths comply with the
graph.

This section provides information about using the
`LOCK_ORDER` tool, but only at a basic level. For
complete details, see the Lock Order section of the MySQL Server
Doxygen documentation, available at
<https://dev.mysql.com/doc/index-other.html>.

The `LOCK_ORDER` tool is intended for debugging
the server, not for production use.

To use the `LOCK_ORDER` tool, follow this
procedure:

1. Build MySQL from source, configuring it with the
   [`-DWITH_LOCK_ORDER=ON`](source-configuration-options.md#option_cmake_with_lock_order)
   **CMake** option so that the build includes
   `LOCK_ORDER` tooling.

   Note

   With the [`WITH_LOCK_ORDER`](source-configuration-options.md#option_cmake_with_lock_order)
   option enabled, MySQL builds require the
   **flex** program.
2. To run the server with the `LOCK_ORDER` tool
   enabled, enable the
   [`lock_order`](lock-order-tool.md#sysvar_lock_order) system variable at
   server startup. Several other system variables for
   `LOCK_ORDER` configuration are available as
   well.
3. For MySQL test suite operation,
   **mysql-test-run.pl** has a
   `--lock-order` option that controls whether to
   enable the `LOCK_ORDER` tool during test case
   execution.

The system variables described following configure operation of
the `LOCK_ORDER` tool, assuming that MySQL has
been built to include `LOCK_ORDER` tooling. The
primary variable is [`lock_order`](lock-order-tool.md#sysvar_lock_order),
which indicates whether to enable the
`LOCK_ORDER` tool at runtime:

- If [`lock_order`](lock-order-tool.md#sysvar_lock_order) is disabled
  (the default), no other `LOCK_ORDER` system
  variables have any effect.
- If [`lock_order`](lock-order-tool.md#sysvar_lock_order) is enabled, the
  other system variables configure which
  `LOCK_ORDER` features to enable.

Note

In general, it is intended that the
`LOCK_ORDER` tool be configured by executing
**mysql-test-run.pl** with the
`--lock-order` option, and for
**mysql-test-run.pl** to set
`LOCK_ORDER` system variables to appropriate
values.

All `LOCK_ORDER` system variables must be set at
server startup. At runtime, their values are visible but cannot be
changed.

Some system variables exist in pairs, such as
[`lock_order_debug_loop`](lock-order-tool.md#sysvar_lock_order_debug_loop) and
[`lock_order_trace_loop`](lock-order-tool.md#sysvar_lock_order_trace_loop). For such
pairs, the variables are distinguished as follows when the
condition occurs with which they are associated:

- If the `_debug_` variable is enabled, a debug
  assertion is raised.
- If the `_trace_` variable is enabled, an
  error is printed to the logs.
