#### 15.6.7.6 Scope Rules for Handlers

A stored program may include handlers to be invoked when certain
conditions occur within the program. The applicability of each
handler depends on its location within the program definition
and on the condition or conditions that it handles:

- A handler declared in a
  [`BEGIN ...
  END`](begin-end.md "15.6.1 BEGIN ... END Compound Statement") block is in scope only for the SQL statements
  following the handler declarations in the block. If the
  handler itself raises a condition, it cannot handle that
  condition, nor can any other handlers declared in the block.
  In the following example, handlers `H1` and
  `H2` are in scope for conditions raised by
  statements *`stmt1`* and
  *`stmt2`*. But neither
  `H1` nor `H2` are in scope
  for conditions raised in the body of `H1`
  or `H2`.

  ```sql
  BEGIN -- outer block
    DECLARE EXIT HANDLER FOR ...;  -- handler H1
    DECLARE EXIT HANDLER FOR ...;  -- handler H2
    stmt1;
    stmt2;
  END;
  ```
- A handler is in scope only for the block in which it is
  declared, and cannot be activated for conditions occurring
  outside that block. In the following example, handler
  `H1` is in scope for
  *`stmt1`* in the inner block, but not
  for *`stmt2`* in the outer block:

  ```sql
  BEGIN -- outer block
    BEGIN -- inner block
      DECLARE EXIT HANDLER FOR ...;  -- handler H1
      stmt1;
    END;
    stmt2;
  END;
  ```
- A handler can be specific or general. A specific handler is
  for a MySQL error code, `SQLSTATE` value,
  or condition name. A general handler is for a condition in
  the `SQLWARNING`,
  `SQLEXCEPTION`, or `NOT
  FOUND` class. Condition specificity is related to
  condition precedence, as described later.

Multiple handlers can be declared in different scopes and with
different specificities. For example, there might be a specific
MySQL error code handler in an outer block, and a general
`SQLWARNING` handler in an inner block. Or
there might be handlers for a specific MySQL error code and the
general `SQLWARNING` class in the same block.

Whether a handler is activated depends not only on its own scope
and condition value, but on what other handlers are present.
When a condition occurs in a stored program, the server searches
for applicable handlers in the current scope (current
[`BEGIN ...
END`](begin-end.md "15.6.1 BEGIN ... END Compound Statement") block). If there are no applicable handlers, the
search continues outward with the handlers in each successive
containing scope (block). When the server finds one or more
applicable handlers at a given scope, it chooses among them
based on condition precedence:

- A MySQL error code handler takes precedence over an
  `SQLSTATE` value handler.
- An `SQLSTATE` value handler takes
  precedence over general `SQLWARNING`,
  `SQLEXCEPTION`, or `NOT
  FOUND` handlers.
- An `SQLEXCEPTION` handler takes precedence
  over an `SQLWARNING` handler.
- It is possible to have several applicable handlers with the
  same precedence. For example, a statement could generate
  multiple warnings with different error codes, for each of
  which an error-specific handler exists. In this case, the
  choice of which handler the server activates is
  nondeterministic, and may change depending on the
  circumstances under which the condition occurs.

One implication of the handler selection rules is that if
multiple applicable handlers occur in different scopes, handlers
with the most local scope take precedence over handlers in outer
scopes, even over those for more specific conditions.

If there is no appropriate handler when a condition occurs, the
action taken depends on the class of the condition:

- For `SQLEXCEPTION` conditions, the stored
  program terminates at the statement that raised the
  condition, as if there were an `EXIT`
  handler. If the program was called by another stored
  program, the calling program handles the condition using the
  handler selection rules applied to its own handlers.
- For `SQLWARNING` conditions, the program
  continues executing, as if there were a
  `CONTINUE` handler.
- For `NOT FOUND` conditions, if the
  condition was raised normally, the action is
  `CONTINUE`. If it was raised by
  [`SIGNAL`](signal.md "15.6.7.5 SIGNAL Statement") or
  [`RESIGNAL`](resignal.md "15.6.7.4 RESIGNAL Statement"), the action is
  `EXIT`.

The following examples demonstrate how MySQL applies the handler
selection rules.

This procedure contains two handlers, one for the specific
`SQLSTATE` value (`'42S02'`)
that occurs for attempts to drop a nonexistent table, and one
for the general `SQLEXCEPTION` class:

```sql
CREATE PROCEDURE p1()
BEGIN
  DECLARE CONTINUE HANDLER FOR SQLSTATE '42S02'
    SELECT 'SQLSTATE handler was activated' AS msg;
  DECLARE CONTINUE HANDLER FOR SQLEXCEPTION
    SELECT 'SQLEXCEPTION handler was activated' AS msg;

  DROP TABLE test.t;
END;
```

Both handlers are declared in the same block and have the same
scope. However, `SQLSTATE` handlers take
precedence over `SQLEXCEPTION` handlers, so if
the table `t` is nonexistent, the
[`DROP TABLE`](drop-table.md "15.1.32 DROP TABLE Statement") statement raises a
condition that activates the `SQLSTATE`
handler:

```sql
mysql> CALL p1();
+--------------------------------+
| msg                            |
+--------------------------------+
| SQLSTATE handler was activated |
+--------------------------------+
```

This procedure contains the same two handlers. But this time,
the [`DROP TABLE`](drop-table.md "15.1.32 DROP TABLE Statement") statement and
`SQLEXCEPTION` handler are in an inner block
relative to the `SQLSTATE` handler:

```sql
CREATE PROCEDURE p2()
BEGIN -- outer block
    DECLARE CONTINUE HANDLER FOR SQLSTATE '42S02'
      SELECT 'SQLSTATE handler was activated' AS msg;
  BEGIN -- inner block
    DECLARE CONTINUE HANDLER FOR SQLEXCEPTION
      SELECT 'SQLEXCEPTION handler was activated' AS msg;

    DROP TABLE test.t; -- occurs within inner block
  END;
END;
```

In this case, the handler that is more local to where the
condition occurs takes precedence. The
`SQLEXCEPTION` handler activates, even though
it is more general than the `SQLSTATE` handler:

```sql
mysql> CALL p2();
+------------------------------------+
| msg                                |
+------------------------------------+
| SQLEXCEPTION handler was activated |
+------------------------------------+
```

In this procedure, one of the handlers is declared in a block
inner to the scope of the [`DROP
TABLE`](drop-table.md "15.1.32 DROP TABLE Statement") statement:

```sql
CREATE PROCEDURE p3()
BEGIN -- outer block
  DECLARE CONTINUE HANDLER FOR SQLEXCEPTION
    SELECT 'SQLEXCEPTION handler was activated' AS msg;
  BEGIN -- inner block
    DECLARE CONTINUE HANDLER FOR SQLSTATE '42S02'
      SELECT 'SQLSTATE handler was activated' AS msg;
  END;

  DROP TABLE test.t; -- occurs within outer block
END;
```

Only the `SQLEXCEPTION` handler applies because
the other one is not in scope for the condition raised by the
[`DROP TABLE`](drop-table.md "15.1.32 DROP TABLE Statement"):

```sql
mysql> CALL p3();
+------------------------------------+
| msg                                |
+------------------------------------+
| SQLEXCEPTION handler was activated |
+------------------------------------+
```

In this procedure, both handlers are declared in a block inner
to the scope of the [`DROP TABLE`](drop-table.md "15.1.32 DROP TABLE Statement")
statement:

```sql
CREATE PROCEDURE p4()
BEGIN -- outer block
  BEGIN -- inner block
    DECLARE CONTINUE HANDLER FOR SQLEXCEPTION
      SELECT 'SQLEXCEPTION handler was activated' AS msg;
    DECLARE CONTINUE HANDLER FOR SQLSTATE '42S02'
      SELECT 'SQLSTATE handler was activated' AS msg;
  END;

  DROP TABLE test.t; -- occurs within outer block
END;
```

Neither handler applies because they are not in scope for the
[`DROP TABLE`](drop-table.md "15.1.32 DROP TABLE Statement"). The condition raised
by the statement goes unhandled and terminates the procedure
with an error:

```sql
mysql> CALL p4();
ERROR 1051 (42S02): Unknown table 'test.t'
```
