Each of the MySQL server instances in a group can run on an
independent physical host machine, which is the recommended way to
deploy Group Replication. This section explains how to create a
replication group with three MySQL Server instances, each running
on a different host machine. See
[Section 20.2.2, “Deploying Group Replication Locally”](group-replication-deploying-locally.md "20.2.2 Deploying Group Replication Locally") for
information about deploying multiple MySQL server instances
running Group Replication on the same host machine, for example
for testing purposes.

**Figure 20.7 Group Architecture**

![Three server instances, S1, S2, and S3, are deployed as an interconnected group, and clients communicate with each of the server instances.](images/gr-3-server-group.png)

This tutorial explains how to get and deploy MySQL Server with the
Group Replication plugin, how to configure each server instance
before creating a group, and how to use Performance Schema
monitoring to verify that everything is working correctly.
