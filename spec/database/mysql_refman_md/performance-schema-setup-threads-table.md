#### 29.12.2.5 The setup\_threads Table

The [`setup_threads`](performance-schema-setup-threads-table.md "29.12.2.5 The setup_threads Table") table lists
instrumented thread classes. It exposes thread class names and
attributes:

```sql
mysql> SELECT * FROM performance_schema.setup_threads\G
*************************** 1. row ***************************
         NAME: thread/performance_schema/setup
      ENABLED: YES
      HISTORY: YES
   PROPERTIES: singleton
   VOLATILITY: 0
DOCUMENTATION: NULL
...
*************************** 4. row ***************************
         NAME: thread/sql/main
      ENABLED: YES
      HISTORY: YES
   PROPERTIES: singleton
   VOLATILITY: 0
DOCUMENTATION: NULL
*************************** 5. row ***************************
         NAME: thread/sql/one_connection
      ENABLED: YES
      HISTORY: YES
   PROPERTIES: user
   VOLATILITY: 0
DOCUMENTATION: NULL
...
*************************** 10. row ***************************
         NAME: thread/sql/event_scheduler
      ENABLED: YES
      HISTORY: YES
   PROPERTIES: singleton
   VOLATILITY: 0
DOCUMENTATION: NULL
```

The [`setup_threads`](performance-schema-setup-threads-table.md "29.12.2.5 The setup_threads Table") table has these
columns:

- `NAME`

  The instrument name. Thread instruments begin with
  `thread` (for example,
  `thread/sql/parser_service` or
  `thread/performance_schema/setup`).
- `ENABLED`

  Whether the instrument is enabled. The value is
  `YES` or `NO`. This
  column can be modified, although setting
  `ENABLED` has no effect for threads that
  are already running.

  For background threads, setting the
  `ENABLED` value controls whether
  `INSTRUMENTED` is set to
  `YES` or `NO` for
  threads that are subsequently created for this instrument
  and listed in the [`threads`](performance-schema-threads-table.md "29.12.21.8 The threads Table")
  table. For foreground threads, this column has no effect;
  the [`setup_actors`](performance-schema-setup-actors-table.md "29.12.2.1 The setup_actors Table") table takes
  precedence.
- `HISTORY`

  Whether to log historical events for the instrument. The
  value is `YES` or `NO`.
  This column can be modified, although setting
  `HISTORY` has no effect for threads that
  are already running.

  For background threads, setting the
  `HISTORY` value controls whether
  `HISTORY` is set to
  `YES` or `NO` for
  threads that are subsequently created for this instrument
  and listed in the [`threads`](performance-schema-threads-table.md "29.12.21.8 The threads Table")
  table. For foreground threads, this column has no effect;
  the [`setup_actors`](performance-schema-setup-actors-table.md "29.12.2.1 The setup_actors Table") table takes
  precedence.
- `PROPERTIES`

  The instrument properties. This column uses the
  [`SET`](set.md "13.3.6 The SET Type") data type, so multiple
  flags from the following list can be set per instrument:

  - `singleton`: The instrument has a
    single instance. For example, there is only one thread
    for the `thread/sql/main` instrument.
  - `user`: The instrument is directly
    related to user workload (as opposed to system
    workload). For example, threads such as
    `thread/sql/one_connection` executing
    a user session have the `user`
    property to differentiate them from system threads.
- `VOLATILITY`

  The instrument volatility. This column has the same
  meaning as in the
  [`setup_instruments`](performance-schema-setup-instruments-table.md "29.12.2.3 The setup_instruments Table") table. See
  [Section 29.12.2.3, “The setup\_instruments Table”](performance-schema-setup-instruments-table.md "29.12.2.3 The setup_instruments Table").
- `DOCUMENTATION`

  A string describing the instrument purpose. The value is
  `NULL` if no description is available.

The [`setup_threads`](performance-schema-setup-threads-table.md "29.12.2.5 The setup_threads Table") table has these
indexes:

- Primary key on (`NAME`)

[`TRUNCATE TABLE`](truncate-table.md "15.1.37 TRUNCATE TABLE Statement") is not permitted
for the [`setup_threads`](performance-schema-setup-threads-table.md "29.12.2.5 The setup_threads Table") table.
