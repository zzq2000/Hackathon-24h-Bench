#### 19.5.1.12 Replication and Floating-Point Values

With statement-based replication, values are converted from
decimal to binary. Because conversions between decimal and
binary representations of them may be approximate, comparisons
involving floating-point values are inexact. This is true for
operations that use floating-point values explicitly, or that
use values that are converted to floating-point implicitly.
Comparisons of floating-point values might yield different
results on source and replica servers due to differences in
computer architecture, the compiler used to build MySQL, and so
forth. See [Section 14.3, “Type Conversion in Expression Evaluation”](type-conversion.md "14.3 Type Conversion in Expression Evaluation"), and
[Section B.3.4.8, “Problems with Floating-Point Values”](problems-with-float.md "B.3.4.8 Problems with Floating-Point Values").
