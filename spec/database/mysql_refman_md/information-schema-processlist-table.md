### 28.3.23 The INFORMATION\_SCHEMA PROCESSLIST Table

Important

[`INFORMATION_SCHEMA.PROCESSLIST`](information-schema-processlist-table.md "28.3.23 The INFORMATION_SCHEMA PROCESSLIST Table") is
deprecated and subject to removal in a future MySQL release. As
such, the implementation of [`SHOW
PROCESSLIST`](show-processlist.md "15.7.7.29 SHOW PROCESSLIST Statement") which uses this table is also deprecated.
It is recommended to use the Performance Schema implementation
of [`PROCESSLIST`](performance-schema-processlist-table.md "29.12.21.7 The processlist Table") instead.

The MySQL process list indicates the operations currently being
performed by the set of threads executing within the server. The
[`PROCESSLIST`](information-schema-processlist-table.md "28.3.23 The INFORMATION_SCHEMA PROCESSLIST Table") table is one source of
process information. For a comparison of this table with other
sources, see [Sources of Process Information](processlist-access.md#processlist-sources "Sources of Process Information").

The [`PROCESSLIST`](information-schema-processlist-table.md "28.3.23 The INFORMATION_SCHEMA PROCESSLIST Table") table has these
columns:

- `ID`

  The connection identifier. This is the same value displayed in
  the `Id` column of the
  [`SHOW PROCESSLIST`](show-processlist.md "15.7.7.29 SHOW PROCESSLIST Statement") statement,
  displayed in the `PROCESSLIST_ID` column of
  the Performance Schema [`threads`](performance-schema-threads-table.md "29.12.21.8 The threads Table")
  table, and returned by the
  [`CONNECTION_ID()`](information-functions.md#function_connection-id) function within
  the thread.
- `USER`

  The MySQL user who issued the statement. A value of
  `system user` refers to a nonclient thread
  spawned by the server to handle tasks internally, for example,
  a delayed-row handler thread or an I/O or SQL thread used on
  replica hosts. For `system user`, there is no
  host specified in the `Host` column.
  `unauthenticated user` refers to a thread
  that has become associated with a client connection but for
  which authentication of the client user has not yet occurred.
  `event_scheduler` refers to the thread that
  monitors scheduled events (see
  [Section 27.4, “Using the Event Scheduler”](event-scheduler.md "27.4 Using the Event Scheduler")).

  Note

  A `USER` value of `system
  user` is distinct from the
  [`SYSTEM_USER`](privileges-provided.md#priv_system-user) privilege. The
  former designates internal threads. The latter distinguishes
  the system user and regular user account categories (see
  [Section 8.2.11, “Account Categories”](account-categories.md "8.2.11 Account Categories")).
- `HOST`

  The host name of the client issuing the statement (except for
  `system user`, for which there is no host).
  The host name for TCP/IP connections is reported in
  `host_name:client_port`
  format to make it easier to determine which client is doing
  what.
- `DB`

  The default database for the thread, or
  `NULL` if none has been selected.
- `COMMAND`

  The type of command the thread is executing on behalf of the
  client, or `Sleep` if the session is idle.
  For descriptions of thread commands, see
  [Section 10.14, “Examining Server Thread (Process) Information”](thread-information.md "10.14 Examining Server Thread (Process) Information"). The value of this column
  corresponds to the
  `COM_xxx` commands
  of the client/server protocol and
  `Com_xxx` status
  variables. See [Section 7.1.10, “Server Status Variables”](server-status-variables.md "7.1.10 Server Status Variables").
- `TIME`

  The time in seconds that the thread has been in its current
  state. For a replica SQL thread, the value is the number of
  seconds between the timestamp of the last replicated event and
  the real time of the replica host. See
  [Section 19.2.3, “Replication Threads”](replication-threads.md "19.2.3 Replication Threads").
- `STATE`

  An action, event, or state that indicates what the thread is
  doing. For descriptions of `STATE` values,
  see [Section 10.14, “Examining Server Thread (Process) Information”](thread-information.md "10.14 Examining Server Thread (Process) Information").

  Most states correspond to very quick operations. If a thread
  stays in a given state for many seconds, there might be a
  problem that needs to be investigated.
- `INFO`

  The statement the thread is executing, or
  `NULL` if it is executing no statement. The
  statement might be the one sent to the server, or an innermost
  statement if the statement executes other statements. For
  example, if a `CALL` statement executes a
  stored procedure that is executing a
  [`SELECT`](select.md "15.2.13 SELECT Statement") statement, the
  `INFO` value shows the
  [`SELECT`](select.md "15.2.13 SELECT Statement") statement.

#### Notes

- [`PROCESSLIST`](information-schema-processlist-table.md "28.3.23 The INFORMATION_SCHEMA PROCESSLIST Table") is a nonstandard
  `INFORMATION_SCHEMA` table.
- Like the output from the [`SHOW
  PROCESSLIST`](show-processlist.md "15.7.7.29 SHOW PROCESSLIST Statement") statement, the
  [`PROCESSLIST`](information-schema-processlist-table.md "28.3.23 The INFORMATION_SCHEMA PROCESSLIST Table") table provides
  information about all threads, even those belonging to other
  users, if you have the [`PROCESS`](privileges-provided.md#priv_process)
  privilege. Otherwise (without the
  [`PROCESS`](privileges-provided.md#priv_process) privilege),
  nonanonymous users have access to information about their own
  threads but not threads for other users, and anonymous users
  have no access to thread information.
- If an SQL statement refers to the
  [`PROCESSLIST`](information-schema-processlist-table.md "28.3.23 The INFORMATION_SCHEMA PROCESSLIST Table") table, MySQL
  populates the entire table once, when statement execution
  begins, so there is read consistency during the statement.
  There is no read consistency for a multi-statement
  transaction.

The following statements are equivalent:

```sql
SELECT * FROM INFORMATION_SCHEMA.PROCESSLIST

SHOW FULL PROCESSLIST
```
