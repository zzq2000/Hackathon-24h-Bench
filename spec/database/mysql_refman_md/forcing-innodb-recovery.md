### 17.21.3 Forcing InnoDB Recovery

To investigate database page corruption, you might dump your
tables from the database with
[`SELECT ... INTO
OUTFILE`](select-into.md "15.2.13.1 SELECT ... INTO Statement"). Usually, most of the data obtained in this way
is intact. Serious corruption might cause `SELECT * FROM
tbl_name` statements or
`InnoDB` background operations to unexpectedly
exit or assert, or even cause `InnoDB`
roll-forward recovery to crash. In such cases, you can use the
[`innodb_force_recovery`](innodb-parameters.md#sysvar_innodb_force_recovery) option to
force the `InnoDB` storage engine to start up
while preventing background operations from running, so that you
can dump your tables. For example, you can add the following line
to the `[mysqld]` section of your option file
before restarting the server:

```ini
[mysqld]
innodb_force_recovery = 1
```

For information about using option files, see
[Section 6.2.2.2, “Using Option Files”](option-files.md "6.2.2.2 Using Option Files").

Warning

Only set [`innodb_force_recovery`](innodb-parameters.md#sysvar_innodb_force_recovery)
to a value greater than 0 in an emergency situation, so that you
can start `InnoDB` and dump your tables. Before
doing so, ensure that you have a backup copy of your database in
case you need to recreate it. Values of 4 or greater can
permanently corrupt data files. Only use an
[`innodb_force_recovery`](innodb-parameters.md#sysvar_innodb_force_recovery) setting
of 4 or greater on a production server instance after you have
successfully tested the setting on a separate physical copy of
your database. When forcing `InnoDB` recovery,
you should always start with
[`innodb_force_recovery=1`](innodb-parameters.md#sysvar_innodb_force_recovery) and
only increase the value incrementally, as necessary.

[`innodb_force_recovery`](innodb-parameters.md#sysvar_innodb_force_recovery) is 0 by
default (normal startup without forced recovery). The permissible
nonzero values for
[`innodb_force_recovery`](innodb-parameters.md#sysvar_innodb_force_recovery) are 1 to 6.
A larger value includes the functionality of lesser values. For
example, a value of 3 includes all of the functionality of values
1 and 2.

If you are able to dump your tables with an
[`innodb_force_recovery`](innodb-parameters.md#sysvar_innodb_force_recovery) value of 3
or less, then you are relatively safe that only some data on
corrupt individual pages is lost. A value of 4 or greater is
considered dangerous because data files can be permanently
corrupted. A value of 6 is considered drastic because database
pages are left in an obsolete state, which in turn may introduce
more corruption into [B-trees](glossary.md#glos_b_tree "B-tree")
and other database structures.

As a safety measure, `InnoDB` prevents
[`INSERT`](insert.md "15.2.7 INSERT Statement"),
[`UPDATE`](update.md "15.2.17 UPDATE Statement"), or
[`DELETE`](delete.md "15.2.2 DELETE Statement") operations when
[`innodb_force_recovery`](innodb-parameters.md#sysvar_innodb_force_recovery) is greater
than 0. An [`innodb_force_recovery`](innodb-parameters.md#sysvar_innodb_force_recovery)
setting of 4 or greater places `InnoDB` in
read-only mode.

- `1`
  (`SRV_FORCE_IGNORE_CORRUPT`)

  Lets the server run even if it detects a corrupt
  [page](glossary.md#glos_page "page"). Tries to make
  `SELECT * FROM
  tbl_name` jump over
  corrupt index records and pages, which helps in dumping
  tables.
- `2`
  (`SRV_FORCE_NO_BACKGROUND`)

  Prevents the [master
  thread](glossary.md#glos_master_thread "master thread") and any [purge
  threads](glossary.md#glos_purge_thread "purge thread") from running. If an unexpected exit would occur
  during the [purge](glossary.md#glos_purge "purge") operation,
  this recovery value prevents it.
- `3`
  (`SRV_FORCE_NO_TRX_UNDO`)

  Does not run transaction
  [rollbacks](glossary.md#glos_rollback "rollback") after
  [crash recovery](glossary.md#glos_crash_recovery "crash recovery").
- `4`
  (`SRV_FORCE_NO_IBUF_MERGE`)

  Prevents [insert
  buffer](glossary.md#glos_insert_buffer "insert buffer") merge operations. If they would cause a crash,
  does not do them. Does not calculate table
  [statistics](glossary.md#glos_statistics "statistics"). This value
  can permanently corrupt data files. After using this value, be
  prepared to drop and recreate all secondary indexes. Sets
  `InnoDB` to read-only.
- `5`
  (`SRV_FORCE_NO_UNDO_LOG_SCAN`)

  Does not look at [undo
  logs](glossary.md#glos_undo_log "undo log") when starting the database:
  `InnoDB` treats even incomplete transactions
  as committed. This value can permanently corrupt data files.
  Sets `InnoDB` to read-only.
- `6`
  (`SRV_FORCE_NO_LOG_REDO`)

  Does not do the [redo log](glossary.md#glos_redo_log "redo log")
  roll-forward in connection with recovery. This value can
  permanently corrupt data files. Leaves database pages in an
  obsolete state, which in turn may introduce more corruption
  into B-trees and other database structures. Sets
  `InnoDB` to read-only.

You can [`SELECT`](select.md "15.2.13 SELECT Statement") from tables to dump
them. With an
[`innodb_force_recovery`](innodb-parameters.md#sysvar_innodb_force_recovery) value of 3
or less you can `DROP` or
`CREATE` tables. [`DROP
TABLE`](drop-table.md "15.1.32 DROP TABLE Statement") is also supported with an
[`innodb_force_recovery`](innodb-parameters.md#sysvar_innodb_force_recovery) value
greater than 3. [`DROP TABLE`](drop-table.md "15.1.32 DROP TABLE Statement") is not
permitted with an
[`innodb_force_recovery`](innodb-parameters.md#sysvar_innodb_force_recovery) value
greater than 4.

If you know that a given table is causing an unexpected exit on
rollback, you can drop it. If you encounter a runaway rollback
caused by a failing mass import or [`ALTER
TABLE`](alter-table.md "15.1.9 ALTER TABLE Statement"), you can kill the [**mysqld**](mysqld.md "6.3.1 mysqld — The MySQL Server")
process and set
[`innodb_force_recovery`](innodb-parameters.md#sysvar_innodb_force_recovery) to
`3` to bring the database up without the
rollback, and then `DROP` the table that is
causing the runaway rollback.

If corruption within the table data prevents you from dumping the
entire table contents, a query with an `ORDER BY
primary_key DESC` clause might
be able to dump the portion of the table after the corrupted part.

If a high [`innodb_force_recovery`](innodb-parameters.md#sysvar_innodb_force_recovery)
value is required to start `InnoDB`, there may be
corrupted data structures that could cause complex queries
(queries containing `WHERE`, `ORDER
BY`, or other clauses) to fail. In this case, you may
only be able to run basic `SELECT * FROM t`
queries.
