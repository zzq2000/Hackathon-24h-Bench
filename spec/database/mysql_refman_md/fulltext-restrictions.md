### 14.9.5 Full-Text Restrictions

- Full-text searches are supported for
  [`InnoDB`](innodb-storage-engine.md "Chapter 17 The InnoDB Storage Engine") and
  [`MyISAM`](myisam-storage-engine.md "18.2 The MyISAM Storage Engine") tables only.
- Full-text searches are not supported for partitioned tables.
  See [Section 26.6, “Restrictions and Limitations on Partitioning”](partitioning-limitations.md "26.6 Restrictions and Limitations on Partitioning").
- Full-text searches can be used with most multibyte character
  sets. The exception is that for Unicode, the
  `utf8mb3` or `utf8mb4`
  character set can be used, but not the
  `ucs2` character set. Although
  `FULLTEXT` indexes on
  `ucs2` columns cannot be used, you can
  perform `IN BOOLEAN MODE` searches on a
  `ucs2` column that has no such index.

  The remarks for `utf8mb3` also apply to
  `utf8mb4`, and the remarks for
  `ucs2` also apply to
  `utf16`, `utf16le`, and
  `utf32`.
- Ideographic languages such as Chinese and Japanese do not
  have word delimiters. Therefore, the built-in full-text
  parser *cannot determine where words begin and end
  in these and other such languages*.

  A character-based ngram full-text parser that supports
  Chinese, Japanese, and Korean (CJK), and a word-based MeCab
  parser plugin that supports Japanese are provided for use
  with `InnoDB` and `MyISAM`
  tables.
- Although the use of multiple character sets within a single
  table is supported, all columns in a
  `FULLTEXT` index must use the same
  character set and collation.
- The [`MATCH()`](fulltext-search.md#function_match) column list must
  match exactly the column list in some
  `FULLTEXT` index definition for the table,
  unless this [`MATCH()`](fulltext-search.md#function_match) is
  `IN BOOLEAN MODE` on a
  `MyISAM` table. For
  `MyISAM` tables, boolean-mode searches can
  be done on nonindexed columns, although they are likely to
  be slow.
- The argument to `AGAINST()` must be a
  string value that is constant during query evaluation. This
  rules out, for example, a table column because that can
  differ for each row.

  As of MySQL 8.0.28, the argument to
  [`MATCH()`](fulltext-search.md#function_match) cannot use a rollup
  column.
- Index hints are more limited for `FULLTEXT`
  searches than for non-`FULLTEXT` searches.
  See [Section 10.9.4, “Index Hints”](index-hints.md "10.9.4 Index Hints").
- For `InnoDB`, all DML operations
  ([`INSERT`](insert.md "15.2.7 INSERT Statement"),
  [`UPDATE`](update.md "15.2.17 UPDATE Statement"),
  [`DELETE`](delete.md "15.2.2 DELETE Statement")) involving columns
  with full-text indexes are processed at transaction commit
  time. For example, for an `INSERT`
  operation, an inserted string is tokenized and decomposed
  into individual words. The individual words are then added
  to full-text index tables when the transaction is committed.
  As a result, full-text searches only return committed data.
- The '%' character is not a supported wildcard character for
  full-text searches.
