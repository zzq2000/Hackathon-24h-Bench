### 17.21.2 Troubleshooting Recovery Failures

From MySQL 8.0.26, checkpoints and advancing the checkpoint LSN
are not permitted until redo log recovery is complete and data
dictionary dynamic metadata (`srv_dict_metadata`)
is transferred to data dictionary table
(`dict_table_t`) objects. Should the redo log run
out of space during recovery or after recovery (but before data
dictionary dynamic metadata is transferred to data dictionary
table objects) as a result of this change, an
[`innodb_force_recovery`](innodb-parameters.md#sysvar_innodb_force_recovery) restart may
be required, starting with at least the
`SRV_FORCE_NO_IBUF_MERGE` setting or, in case
that fails, the `SRV_FORCE_NO_LOG_REDO` setting.
If an [`innodb_force_recovery`](innodb-parameters.md#sysvar_innodb_force_recovery)
restart fails in this scenario, recovery from backup may be
necessary. (Bug #32200595)
