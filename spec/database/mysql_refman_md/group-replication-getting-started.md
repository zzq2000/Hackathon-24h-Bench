[20.2.2 Deploying Group Replication Locally](group-replication-deploying-locally.md)

MySQL Group Replication is provided as a plugin for the MySQL
server; each server in a group requires configuration and
installation of the plugin. This section provides a detailed
tutorial with the steps required to create a replication group with
at least three members.

Tip

To deploy multiple instances of MySQL, you can use [InnoDB Cluster](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/mysql-shell/8.0/en/mysql-innodb-cluster.html) which enables you to easily administer a group of MySQL server instances in [MySQL Shell](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/mysql-shell/8.0/en/). InnoDB Cluster wraps MySQL Group Replication in a programmatic environment that enables you easily deploy a cluster of MySQL instances to achieve high availability. In addition, InnoDB Cluster interfaces seamlessly with [MySQL Router](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/mysql-router/8.0/en/), which enables your applications to connect to the cluster without writing your own failover process. For similar use cases that do not require high availability, however, you can use [InnoDB ReplicaSet](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/mysql-shell/8.0/en/mysql-innodb-replicaset.html). Installation instructions for MySQL Shell can be found [here](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/mysql-shell/8.0/en/mysql-shell-install.html).
