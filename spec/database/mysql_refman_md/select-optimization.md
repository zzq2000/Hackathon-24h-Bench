Queries, in the form of [`SELECT`](select.md "15.2.13 SELECT Statement")
statements, perform all the lookup operations in the database.
Tuning these statements is a top priority, whether to achieve
sub-second response times for dynamic web pages, or to chop
hours off the time to generate huge overnight reports.

Besides [`SELECT`](select.md "15.2.13 SELECT Statement") statements, the
tuning techniques for queries also apply to constructs such as
[`CREATE
TABLE...AS SELECT`](create-table-select.md "15.1.20.4 CREATE TABLE ... SELECT Statement"),
[`INSERT
INTO...SELECT`](insert-select.md "15.2.7.1 INSERT ... SELECT Statement"), and `WHERE` clauses in
[`DELETE`](delete.md "15.2.2 DELETE Statement") statements. Those
statements have additional performance considerations because
they combine write operations with the read-oriented query
operations.

NDB Cluster supports a join pushdown optimization whereby a
qualifying join is sent in its entirety to NDB Cluster data
nodes, where it can be distributed among them and executed in
parallel. For more information about this optimization, see
[Conditions for NDB pushdown joins](mysql-cluster-options-variables.md#ndb_join_pushdown-conditions "Conditions for NDB pushdown joins").

The main considerations for optimizing queries are:

- To make a slow `SELECT ... WHERE` query
  faster, the first thing to check is whether you can add an
  [index](glossary.md#glos_index "index"). Set up indexes on
  columns used in the `WHERE` clause, to
  speed up evaluation, filtering, and the final retrieval of
  results. To avoid wasted disk space, construct a small set
  of indexes that speed up many related queries used in your
  application.

  Indexes are especially important for queries that reference
  different tables, using features such as
  [joins](glossary.md#glos_join "join") and
  [foreign keys](glossary.md#glos_foreign_key "foreign key"). You
  can use the [`EXPLAIN`](explain.md "15.8.2 EXPLAIN Statement") statement
  to determine which indexes are used for a
  [`SELECT`](select.md "15.2.13 SELECT Statement"). See
  [Section 10.3.1, “How MySQL Uses Indexes”](mysql-indexes.md "10.3.1 How MySQL Uses Indexes") and
  [Section 10.8.1, “Optimizing Queries with EXPLAIN”](using-explain.md "10.8.1 Optimizing Queries with EXPLAIN").
- Isolate and tune any part of the query, such as a function
  call, that takes excessive time. Depending on how the query
  is structured, a function could be called once for every row
  in the result set, or even once for every row in the table,
  greatly magnifying any inefficiency.
- Minimize the number of
  [full table scans](glossary.md#glos_full_table_scan "full table scan")
  in your queries, particularly for big tables.
- Keep table statistics up to date by using the
  [`ANALYZE TABLE`](analyze-table.md "15.7.3.1 ANALYZE TABLE Statement") statement
  periodically, so the optimizer has the information needed to
  construct an efficient execution plan.
- Learn the tuning techniques, indexing techniques, and
  configuration parameters that are specific to the storage
  engine for each table. Both `InnoDB` and
  `MyISAM` have sets of guidelines for
  enabling and sustaining high performance in queries. For
  details, see [Section 10.5.6, “Optimizing InnoDB Queries”](optimizing-innodb-queries.md "10.5.6 Optimizing InnoDB Queries") and
  [Section 10.6.1, “Optimizing MyISAM Queries”](optimizing-queries-myisam.md "10.6.1 Optimizing MyISAM Queries").
- You can optimize single-query transactions for
  `InnoDB` tables, using the technique in
  [Section 10.5.3, “Optimizing InnoDB Read-Only Transactions”](innodb-performance-ro-txn.md "10.5.3 Optimizing InnoDB Read-Only Transactions").
- Avoid transforming the query in ways that make it hard to
  understand, especially if the optimizer does some of the
  same transformations automatically.
- If a performance issue is not easily solved by one of the
  basic guidelines, investigate the internal details of the
  specific query by reading the
  [`EXPLAIN`](explain.md "15.8.2 EXPLAIN Statement") plan and adjusting
  your indexes, `WHERE` clauses, join
  clauses, and so on. (When you reach a certain level of
  expertise, reading the
  [`EXPLAIN`](explain.md "15.8.2 EXPLAIN Statement") plan might be your
  first step for every query.)
- Adjust the size and properties of the memory areas that
  MySQL uses for caching. With efficient use of the
  `InnoDB`
  [buffer pool](glossary.md#glos_buffer_pool "buffer pool"),
  `MyISAM` key cache, and the MySQL query
  cache, repeated queries run faster because the results are
  retrieved from memory the second and subsequent times.
- Even for a query that runs fast using the cache memory
  areas, you might still optimize further so that they require
  less cache memory, making your application more scalable.
  Scalability means that your application can handle more
  simultaneous users, larger requests, and so on without
  experiencing a big drop in performance.
- Deal with locking issues, where the speed of your query
  might be affected by other sessions accessing the tables at
  the same time.
