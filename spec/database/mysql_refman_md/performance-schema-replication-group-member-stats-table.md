#### 29.12.11.15 The replication\_group\_member\_stats Table

This table shows statistical information for replication group
members. It is populated only when Group Replication is
running.

The `replication_group_member_stats` table
has these columns:

- `CHANNEL_NAME`

  Name of the Group Replication channel
- `VIEW_ID`

  Current view identifier for this group.
- `MEMBER_ID`

  The member server UUID. This has a different value for
  each member in the group. This also serves as a key
  because it is unique to each member.
- `COUNT_TRANSACTIONS_IN_QUEUE`

  The number of transactions in the queue pending conflict
  detection checks. Once the transactions have been checked
  for conflicts, if they pass the check, they are queued to
  be applied as well.
- `COUNT_TRANSACTIONS_CHECKED`

  The number of transactions that have been checked for
  conflicts.
- `COUNT_CONFLICTS_DETECTED`

  The number of transactions that have not passed the
  conflict detection check.
- `COUNT_TRANSACTIONS_ROWS_VALIDATING`

  Number of transaction rows which can be used for
  certification, but have not been garbage collected. Can be
  thought of as the current size of the conflict detection
  database against which each transaction is certified.
- `TRANSACTIONS_COMMITTED_ALL_MEMBERS`

  The transactions that have been successfully committed on
  all members of the replication group, shown as
  [GTID Sets](replication-gtids-concepts.md#replication-gtids-concepts-gtid-sets "GTID Sets").
  This is updated at a fixed time interval.
- `LAST_CONFLICT_FREE_TRANSACTION`

  The transaction identifier of the last conflict free
  transaction which was checked.
- `COUNT_TRANSACTIONS_REMOTE_IN_APPLIER_QUEUE`

  The number of transactions that this member has received
  from the replication group which are waiting to be
  applied.
- `COUNT_TRANSACTIONS_REMOTE_APPLIED`

  Number of transactions this member has received from the
  group and applied.
- `COUNT_TRANSACTIONS_LOCAL_PROPOSED`

  Number of transactions which originated on this member and
  were sent to the group.
- `COUNT_TRANSACTIONS_LOCAL_ROLLBACK`

  Number of transactions which originated on this member and
  were rolled back by the group.
