#### 13.4.2.7 Polygon Class

A `Polygon` is a planar
`Surface` representing a multisided geometry.
It is defined by a single exterior boundary and zero or more
interior boundaries, where each interior boundary defines a
hole in the `Polygon`.

**`Polygon`
Examples**

- On a region map, `Polygon` objects could
  represent forests, districts, and so on.

**`Polygon`
Assertions**

- The boundary of a `Polygon` consists of a
  set of `LinearRing` objects (that is,
  `LineString` objects that are both simple
  and closed) that make up its exterior and interior
  boundaries.
- A `Polygon` has no rings that cross. The
  rings in the boundary of a `Polygon` may
  intersect at a `Point`, but only as a
  tangent.
- A `Polygon` has no lines, spikes, or
  punctures.
- A `Polygon` has an interior that is a
  connected point set.
- A `Polygon` may have holes. The exterior
  of a `Polygon` with holes is not
  connected. Each hole defines a connected component of the
  exterior.

The preceding assertions make a `Polygon` a
simple geometry.
