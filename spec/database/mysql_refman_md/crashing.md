#### B.3.3.3 What to Do If MySQL Keeps Crashing

Each MySQL version is tested on many platforms before it is
released. This does not mean that there are no bugs in MySQL,
but if there are bugs, they should be very few and can be hard
to find. If you have a problem, it always helps if you try to
find out exactly what crashes your system, because you have a
much better chance of getting the problem fixed quickly.

First, you should try to find out whether the problem is that
the [**mysqld**](mysqld.md "6.3.1 mysqld — The MySQL Server") server dies or whether your
problem has to do with your client. You can check how long
your [**mysqld**](mysqld.md "6.3.1 mysqld — The MySQL Server") server has been up by executing
[**mysqladmin version**](mysqladmin.md "6.5.2 mysqladmin — A MySQL Server Administration Program"). If
[**mysqld**](mysqld.md "6.3.1 mysqld — The MySQL Server") has died and restarted, you may find
the reason by looking in the server's error log. See
[Section 7.4.2, “The Error Log”](error-log.md "7.4.2 The Error Log").

On some systems, you can find in the error log a stack trace
of where [**mysqld**](mysqld.md "6.3.1 mysqld — The MySQL Server") died. Note that the
variable values written in the error log may not always be
100% correct.

If you find that [**mysqld**](mysqld.md "6.3.1 mysqld — The MySQL Server") fails at startup
during `InnoDB` recovery, refer to
[Section 17.21.2, “Troubleshooting Recovery Failures”](innodb-troubleshooting-recovery.md "17.21.2 Troubleshooting Recovery Failures").

Many unexpected server exits are caused by corrupted data
files or index files. MySQL updates the files on disk with the
`write()` system call after every SQL
statement and before the client is notified about the result.
(This is not true if you are running with the
[`delay_key_write`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_delay_key_write) system
variable enabled, in which case data files are written but not
index files.) This means that data file contents are safe even
if [**mysqld**](mysqld.md "6.3.1 mysqld — The MySQL Server") crashes, because the operating
system ensures that the unflushed data is written to disk. You
can force MySQL to flush everything to disk after every SQL
statement by starting [**mysqld**](mysqld.md "6.3.1 mysqld — The MySQL Server") with the
[`--flush`](server-options.md#option_mysqld_flush) option.

The preceding means that normally you should not get corrupted
tables unless one of the following happens:

- The MySQL server or the server host was killed in the
  middle of an update.
- You have found a bug in [**mysqld**](mysqld.md "6.3.1 mysqld — The MySQL Server") that
  caused it to die in the middle of an update.
- Some external program is manipulating data files or index
  files at the same time as [**mysqld**](mysqld.md "6.3.1 mysqld — The MySQL Server")
  without locking the table properly.
- You are running many [**mysqld**](mysqld.md "6.3.1 mysqld — The MySQL Server") servers
  using the same data directory on a system that does not
  support good file system locks (normally handled by the
  `lockd` lock manager), or you are running
  multiple servers with external locking disabled.
- You have a crashed data file or index file that contains
  very corrupt data that confused [**mysqld**](mysqld.md "6.3.1 mysqld — The MySQL Server").
- You have found a bug in the data storage code. This is not
  likely, but it is at least possible. In this case, you can
  try to change the storage engine to another engine by
  using [`ALTER TABLE`](alter-table.md "15.1.9 ALTER TABLE Statement") on a
  repaired copy of the table.

Because it is very difficult to know why something is
crashing, first try to check whether things that work for
others result in an unexpected exit for you. Try the following
things:

- Stop the [**mysqld**](mysqld.md "6.3.1 mysqld — The MySQL Server") server with
  [**mysqladmin shutdown**](mysqladmin.md "6.5.2 mysqladmin — A MySQL Server Administration Program"), run
  [**myisamchk --silent --force \*/\*.MYI**](myisamchk.md "6.6.4 myisamchk — MyISAM Table-Maintenance Utility") from
  the data directory to check all `MyISAM`
  tables, and restart [**mysqld**](mysqld.md "6.3.1 mysqld — The MySQL Server"). This
  ensures that you are running from a clean state. See
  [Chapter 7, *MySQL Server Administration*](server-administration.md "Chapter 7 MySQL Server Administration").
- Start [**mysqld**](mysqld.md "6.3.1 mysqld — The MySQL Server") with the general query log
  enabled (see [Section 7.4.3, “The General Query Log”](query-log.md "7.4.3 The General Query Log")). Then try to
  determine from the information written to the log whether
  some specific query kills the server. About 95% of all
  bugs are related to a particular query. Normally, this is
  one of the last queries in the log file just before the
  server restarts. See [Section 7.4.3, “The General Query Log”](query-log.md "7.4.3 The General Query Log"). If you
  can repeatedly kill MySQL with a specific query, even when
  you have checked all tables just before issuing it, then
  you have isolated the bug and should submit a bug report
  for it. See [Section 1.5, “How to Report Bugs or Problems”](bug-reports.md "1.5 How to Report Bugs or Problems").
- Try to make a test case that we can use to repeat the
  problem. See [Section 7.9, “Debugging MySQL”](debugging-mysql.md "7.9 Debugging MySQL").
- Try the `fork_big.pl` script. (It is
  located in the `tests` directory of
  source distributions.)
- Configuring MySQL for debugging makes it much easier to
  gather information about possible errors if something goes
  wrong. Reconfigure MySQL with the
  [`-DWITH_DEBUG=1`](source-configuration-options.md#option_cmake_with_debug) option to
  **CMake** and then recompile. See
  [Section 7.9, “Debugging MySQL”](debugging-mysql.md "7.9 Debugging MySQL").
- Make sure that you have applied the latest patches for
  your operating system.
- Use the
  [`--skip-external-locking`](server-options.md#option_mysqld_external-locking)
  option to [**mysqld**](mysqld.md "6.3.1 mysqld — The MySQL Server"). On some systems, the
  `lockd` lock manager does not work
  properly; the
  [`--skip-external-locking`](server-options.md#option_mysqld_external-locking)
  option tells [**mysqld**](mysqld.md "6.3.1 mysqld — The MySQL Server") not to use external
  locking. (This means that you cannot run two
  [**mysqld**](mysqld.md "6.3.1 mysqld — The MySQL Server") servers on the same data
  directory and that you must be careful if you use
  [**myisamchk**](myisamchk.md "6.6.4 myisamchk — MyISAM Table-Maintenance Utility"). Nevertheless, it may be
  instructive to try the option as a test.)
- If [**mysqld**](mysqld.md "6.3.1 mysqld — The MySQL Server") appears to be running but not
  responding, try [**mysqladmin -u root
  processlist**](mysqladmin.md "6.5.2 mysqladmin — A MySQL Server Administration Program"). Sometimes [**mysqld**](mysqld.md "6.3.1 mysqld — The MySQL Server")
  is not hung even though it seems unresponsive. The problem
  may be that all connections are in use, or there may be
  some internal lock problem. [**mysqladmin -u root
  processlist**](mysqladmin.md "6.5.2 mysqladmin — A MySQL Server Administration Program") usually is able to make a connection
  even in these cases, and can provide useful information
  about the current number of connections and their status.
- Run the command [**mysqladmin -i 5 status**](mysqladmin.md "6.5.2 mysqladmin — A MySQL Server Administration Program")
  or [**mysqladmin -i 5 -r status**](mysqladmin.md "6.5.2 mysqladmin — A MySQL Server Administration Program") in a
  separate window to produce statistics while running other
  queries.
- Try the following:

  1. Start [**mysqld**](mysqld.md "6.3.1 mysqld — The MySQL Server") from
     **gdb** (or another debugger). See
     [Section 7.9, “Debugging MySQL”](debugging-mysql.md "7.9 Debugging MySQL").
  2. Run your test scripts.
  3. Print the backtrace and the local variables at the
     three lowest levels. In **gdb**, you
     can do this with the following commands when
     [**mysqld**](mysqld.md "6.3.1 mysqld — The MySQL Server") has crashed inside
     **gdb**:

     ```none
     backtrace
     info local
     up
     info local
     up
     info local
     ```

     With **gdb**, you can also examine
     which threads exist with `info
     threads` and switch to a specific thread with
     `thread
     N`, where
     *`N`* is the thread ID.
- Try to simulate your application with a Perl script to
  force MySQL to exit or misbehave.
- Send a normal bug report. See
  [Section 1.5, “How to Report Bugs or Problems”](bug-reports.md "1.5 How to Report Bugs or Problems"). Be even more detailed than
  usual. Because MySQL works for many people, the crash
  might result from something that exists only on your
  computer (for example, an error that is related to your
  particular system libraries).
- If you have a problem with tables containing
  dynamic-length rows and you are using only
  [`VARCHAR`](char.md "13.3.2 The CHAR and VARCHAR Types") columns (not
  [`BLOB`](blob.md "13.3.4 The BLOB and TEXT Types") or
  [`TEXT`](blob.md "13.3.4 The BLOB and TEXT Types") columns), you can try
  to change all [`VARCHAR`](char.md "13.3.2 The CHAR and VARCHAR Types") to
  [`CHAR`](char.md "13.3.2 The CHAR and VARCHAR Types") with
  [`ALTER TABLE`](alter-table.md "15.1.9 ALTER TABLE Statement"). This forces
  MySQL to use fixed-size rows. Fixed-size rows take a
  little extra space, but are much more tolerant to
  corruption.

  The current dynamic row code has been in use for several
  years with very few problems, but dynamic-length rows are
  by nature more prone to errors, so it may be a good idea
  to try this strategy to see whether it helps.
- Consider the possibility of hardware faults when
  diagnosing problems. Defective hardware can be the cause
  of data corruption. Pay particular attention to your
  memory and disk subsystems when troubleshooting hardware.
