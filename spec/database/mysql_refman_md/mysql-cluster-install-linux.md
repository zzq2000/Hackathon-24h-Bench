This section covers installation methods for NDB Cluster on Linux
and other Unix-like operating systems. While the next few sections
refer to a Linux operating system, the instructions and procedures
given there should be easily adaptable to other supported
Unix-like platforms. For manual installation and setup
instructions specific to Windows systems, see
[Section 25.3.2, “Installing NDB Cluster on Windows”](mysql-cluster-install-windows.md "25.3.2 Installing NDB Cluster on Windows").

Each NDB Cluster host computer must have the correct executable
programs installed. A host running an SQL node must have installed
on it a MySQL Server binary ([**mysqld**](mysqld.md "6.3.1 mysqld — The MySQL Server")).
Management nodes require the management server daemon
([**ndb\_mgmd**](mysql-cluster-programs-ndb-mgmd.md "25.5.4 ndb_mgmd — The NDB Cluster Management Server Daemon")); data nodes require the data node
daemon ([**ndbd**](mysql-cluster-programs-ndbd.md "25.5.1 ndbd — The NDB Cluster Data Node Daemon") or [**ndbmtd**](mysql-cluster-programs-ndbmtd.md "25.5.3 ndbmtd — The NDB Cluster Data Node Daemon (Multi-Threaded)")). It
is not necessary to install the MySQL Server binary on management
node hosts and data node hosts. It is recommended that you also
install the management client ([**ndb\_mgm**](mysql-cluster-programs-ndb-mgm.md "25.5.5 ndb_mgm — The NDB Cluster Management Client")) on the
management server host.

Installation of NDB Cluster on Linux can be done using precompiled
binaries from Oracle (downloaded as a .tar.gz archive), with RPM
packages (also available from Oracle), or from source code. All
three of these installation methods are described in the section
that follow.

Regardless of the method used, it is still necessary following
installation of the NDB Cluster binaries to create configuration
files for all cluster nodes, before you can start the cluster. See
[Section 25.3.3, “Initial Configuration of NDB Cluster”](mysql-cluster-install-configuration.md "25.3.3 Initial Configuration of NDB Cluster").
