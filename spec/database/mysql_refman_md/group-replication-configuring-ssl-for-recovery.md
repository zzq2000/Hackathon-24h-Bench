#### 20.6.3.2 Secure Socket Layer (SSL) Connections for Distributed Recovery

Important

When using the MySQL communication stack
([`group_replication_communication_stack=MYSQL`](group-replication-system-variables.md#sysvar_group_replication_communication_stack))
AND secure connections between members
([`group_replication_ssl_mode`](group-replication-system-variables.md#sysvar_group_replication_ssl_mode)
is not set to `DISABLED`), the security
settings discussed in this section are applied not just to
distributed recovery connections, but to group communications
between members in general. See
[Section 20.6.1, “Communication Stack for Connection Security Management”](group-replication-connection-security.md "20.6.1 Communication Stack for Connection Security Management").

Whether the distributed recovery connection is made using the
standard SQL client connection or a distributed recovery
endpoint, to configure the connection securely, you can use
Group Replication's dedicated distributed recovery SSL options.
These options correspond to the server SSL options that are used
for group communication connections, but they are only applied
for distributed recovery connections. By default, distributed
recovery connections do not use SSL, even if you activated SSL
for group communication connections, and the server SSL options
are not applied for distributed recovery connections. You must
configure these connections separately.

If a remote cloning operation is used as part of distributed
recovery, Group Replication automatically configures the clone
plugin's SSL options to match your settings for the distributed
recovery SSL options. (For details of how the clone plugin uses
SSL, see [Configuring an Encrypted Connection for Cloning](clone-plugin-remote.md#clone-plugin-remote-ssl "Configuring an Encrypted Connection for Cloning").)

The distributed recovery SSL options are as follows:

- [`group_replication_recovery_use_ssl`](group-replication-system-variables.md#sysvar_group_replication_recovery_use_ssl):
  Set to `ON` to make Group Replication use
  SSL for distributed recovery connections, including remote
  cloning operations and state transfer from a donor's
  binary log. If the server you connect to does not use the
  default configuration for this (see
  [Section 8.3.1, “Configuring MySQL to Use Encrypted Connections”](using-encrypted-connections.md "8.3.1 Configuring MySQL to Use Encrypted Connections")), use the
  other distributed recovery SSL options to determine which
  certificates and cipher suites to use.
- [`group_replication_recovery_ssl_ca`](group-replication-system-variables.md#sysvar_group_replication_recovery_ssl_ca):
  The path name of the Certificate Authority (CA) file to use
  for distributed recovery connections. Group Replication
  automatically configures the clone SSL option
  [`clone_ssl_ca`](clone-plugin-options-variables.md#sysvar_clone_ssl_ca) to match this.

  [`group_replication_recovery_ssl_capath`](group-replication-system-variables.md#sysvar_group_replication_recovery_ssl_capath):
  The path name of a directory that contains trusted SSL
  certificate authority (CA) certificate files.
- [`group_replication_recovery_ssl_cert`](group-replication-system-variables.md#sysvar_group_replication_recovery_ssl_cert):
  The path name of the SSL public key certificate file to use
  for distributed recovery connections. Group Replication
  automatically configures the clone SSL option
  [`clone_ssl_cert`](clone-plugin-options-variables.md#sysvar_clone_ssl_cert) to match
  this.
- [`group_replication_recovery_ssl_key`](group-replication-system-variables.md#sysvar_group_replication_recovery_ssl_key):
  The path name of the SSL private key file to use for
  distributed recovery connections. Group Replication
  automatically configures the clone SSL option
  [`clone_ssl_cert`](clone-plugin-options-variables.md#sysvar_clone_ssl_cert) to match
  this.
- [`group_replication_recovery_ssl_verify_server_cert`](group-replication-system-variables.md#sysvar_group_replication_recovery_ssl_verify_server_cert):
  Makes the distributed recovery connection check the server's
  Common Name value in the donor sent certificate. Setting
  this option to `ON` is the equivalent for
  distributed recovery connections of setting
  `VERIFY_IDENTITY` for the
  [`group_replication_ssl_mode`](group-replication-system-variables.md#sysvar_group_replication_ssl_mode)
  option for group communication connections.
- [`group_replication_recovery_ssl_crl`](group-replication-system-variables.md#sysvar_group_replication_recovery_ssl_crl):
  The path name of a file containing certificate revocation
  lists.
- [`group_replication_recovery_ssl_crlpath`](group-replication-system-variables.md#sysvar_group_replication_recovery_ssl_crlpath):
  The path name of a directory containing certificate
  revocation lists.
- [`group_replication_recovery_ssl_cipher`](group-replication-system-variables.md#sysvar_group_replication_recovery_ssl_cipher):
  A list of permissible ciphers for connection encryption for
  the distributed recovery connection. Specify a list of one
  or more cipher names, separated by colons. For information
  about which encryption ciphers MySQL supports, see
  [Section 8.3.2, “Encrypted Connection TLS Protocols and Ciphers”](encrypted-connection-protocols-ciphers.md "8.3.2 Encrypted Connection TLS Protocols and Ciphers").
- [`group_replication_recovery_tls_version`](group-replication-system-variables.md#sysvar_group_replication_recovery_tls_version):
  A comma-separated list of one or more permitted TLS
  protocols for connection encryption when this server
  instance is the client in the distributed recovery
  connection, that is, the joining member. The default for
  this system variable depends on the TLS protocol versions
  supported in the MySQL Server release. The group members
  involved in each distributed recovery connection as the
  client (joining member) and server (donor) negotiate the
  highest protocol version that they are both set up to
  support. This system variable is available from MySQL
  8.0.19.
- [`group_replication_recovery_tls_ciphersuites`](group-replication-system-variables.md#sysvar_group_replication_recovery_tls_ciphersuites):
  A colon-separated list of one or more permitted ciphersuites
  when TLSv1.3 is used for connection encryption for the
  distributed recovery connection, and this server instance is
  the client in the distributed recovery connection, that is,
  the joining member. If this system variable is set to
  `NULL` when TLSv1.3 is used (which is the
  default if you do not set the system variable), the
  ciphersuites that are enabled by default are allowed, as
  listed in
  [Section 8.3.2, “Encrypted Connection TLS Protocols and Ciphers”](encrypted-connection-protocols-ciphers.md "8.3.2 Encrypted Connection TLS Protocols and Ciphers"). If
  this system variable is set to the empty string, no cipher
  suites are allowed, and TLSv1.3 is therefore not used. This
  system variable is available beginning with MySQL 8.0.19.
