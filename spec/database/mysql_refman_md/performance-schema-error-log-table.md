#### 29.12.21.2 The error\_log Table

Of the logs the MySQL server maintains, one is the error log
to which it writes diagnostic messages (see
[Section 7.4.2, “The Error Log”](error-log.md "7.4.2 The Error Log")). Typically, the server writes
diagnostics to a file on the server host or to a system log
service. As of MySQL 8.0.22, depending on error log
configuration, the server can also write the most recent error
events to the Performance Schema
[`error_log`](performance-schema-error-log-table.md "29.12.21.2 The error_log Table") table. Granting the
[`SELECT`](privileges-provided.md#priv_select) privilege for the
[`error_log`](performance-schema-error-log-table.md "29.12.21.2 The error_log Table") table thus gives
clients and applications access to error log contents using
SQL queries, enabling DBAs to provide access to the log
without the need to permit direct file system access on the
server host.

The [`error_log`](performance-schema-error-log-table.md "29.12.21.2 The error_log Table") table supports
focused queries based on its more structured columns. It also
includes the full text of error messages to support more
free-form analysis.

The table implementation uses a fixed-size, in-memory ring
buffer, with old events automatically discarded as necessary
to make room for new ones.

Example [`error_log`](performance-schema-error-log-table.md "29.12.21.2 The error_log Table") contents:

```

The [`error_log`](performance-schema-error-log-table.md "29.12.21.2 The error_log Table") table has the
following columns. As indicated in the descriptions, all but
the `DATA` column correspond to fields of the
underlying error event structure, which is described in
[Section 7.4.2.3, “Error Event Fields”](error-log-event-fields.md "7.4.2.3 Error Event Fields").

- `LOGGED`

  The event timestamp, with microsecond precision.
  `LOGGED` corresponds to the
  `time` field of error events, although
  with certain potential differences:

  - `time` values in the error log are
    displayed according to the
    [`log_timestamps`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_log_timestamps) system
    variable setting; see
    [Early-Startup Logging Output Format](error-log-format.md#error-log-format-output-format-for-early-logging "Early-Startup Logging Output Format").
  - The `LOGGED` column stores values
    using the [`TIMESTAMP`](datetime.md "13.2.2 The DATE, DATETIME, and TIMESTAMP Types")
    data type, for which values are stored in UTC but
    displayed when retrieved in the current session time
    zone; see [Section 13.2.2, “The DATE, DATETIME, and TIMESTAMP Types”](datetime.md "13.2.2 The DATE, DATETIME, and TIMESTAMP Types").

  To display `LOGGED` values in the same
  time zone as displayed in the error log file, first set
  the session time zone as follows:

  ```sql
  SET @@session.time_zone = @@global.log_timestamps;
  ```

  If the [`log_timestamps`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_log_timestamps)
  value is `UTC` and your system does not
  have named time zone support installed (see
  [Section 7.1.15, “MySQL Server Time Zone Support”](time-zone-support.md "7.1.15 MySQL Server Time Zone Support")), set the time zone
  like this:

  ```sql
  SET @@session.time_zone = '+00:00';
  ```
- `THREAD_ID`

  The MySQL thread ID. `THREAD_ID`
  corresponds to the `thread` field of
  error events.

  Within the Performance Schema, the
  `THREAD_ID` column in the
  [`error_log`](performance-schema-error-log-table.md "29.12.21.2 The error_log Table") table is most
  similar to the `PROCESSLIST_ID` column of
  the [`threads`](performance-schema-threads-table.md "29.12.21.8 The threads Table") table:

  - For foreground threads, `THREAD_ID`
    and `PROCESSLIST_ID` represent a
    connection identifier. This is the same value
    displayed in the `ID` column of the
    `INFORMATION_SCHEMA`
    [`PROCESSLIST`](information-schema-processlist-table.md "28.3.23 The INFORMATION_SCHEMA PROCESSLIST Table") table,
    displayed in the `Id` column of
    [`SHOW PROCESSLIST`](show-processlist.md "15.7.7.29 SHOW PROCESSLIST Statement")
    output, and returned by the
    [`CONNECTION_ID()`](information-functions.md#function_connection-id)
    function within the thread.
  - For background threads, `THREAD_ID`
    is 0 and `PROCESSLIST_ID` is
    `NULL`.

  Many Performance Schema tables other than
  [`error_log`](performance-schema-error-log-table.md "29.12.21.2 The error_log Table") has a column named
  `THREAD_ID`, but in those tables, the
  `THREAD_ID` column is a value assigned
  internally by the Performance Schema.
- `PRIO`

  The event priority. Permitted values are
  `System`, `Error`,
  `Warning`, `Note`. The
  `PRIO` column is based on the
  `label` field of error events, which
  itself is based on the underlying numeric
  `prio` field value.
- `ERROR_CODE`

  The numeric event error code.
  `ERROR_CODE` corresponds to the
  `error_code` field of error events.
- `SUBSYSTEM`

  The subsystem in which the event occurred.
  `SUBSYSTEM` corresponds to the
  `subsystem` field of error events.
- `DATA`

  The text representation of the error event. The format of
  this value depends on the format produced by the log sink
  component that generates the
  [`error_log`](performance-schema-error-log-table.md "29.12.21.2 The error_log Table") row. For example,
  if the log sink is `log_sink_internal` or
  `log_sink_json`, `DATA`
  values represent error events in traditional or JSON
  format, respectively. (See
  [Section 7.4.2.9, “Error Log Output Format”](error-log-format.md "7.4.2.9 Error Log Output Format").)

  Because the error log can be reconfigured to change the
  log sink component that supplies rows to the
  [`error_log`](performance-schema-error-log-table.md "29.12.21.2 The error_log Table") table, and because
  different sinks produce different output formats, it is
  possible for rows written to the
  [`error_log`](performance-schema-error-log-table.md "29.12.21.2 The error_log Table") table at different
  times to have different `DATA` formats.

The [`error_log`](performance-schema-error-log-table.md "29.12.21.2 The error_log Table") table has these
indexes:

- Primary key on (`LOGGED`)
- Index on (`THREAD_ID`)
- Index on (`PRIO`)
- Index on (`ERROR_CODE`)
- Index on (`SUBSYSTEM`)

[`TRUNCATE TABLE`](truncate-table.md "15.1.37 TRUNCATE TABLE Statement") is not permitted
for the [`error_log`](performance-schema-error-log-table.md "29.12.21.2 The error_log Table") table.

##### Implementation and Configuration of the error\_log Table

The Performance Schema
[`error_log`](performance-schema-error-log-table.md "29.12.21.2 The error_log Table") table is populated by
error log sink components that write to the table in
addition to writing formatted error events to the error log.
Performance Schema support by log sinks has two parts:

- A log sink can write new error events to the
  [`error_log`](performance-schema-error-log-table.md "29.12.21.2 The error_log Table") table as they
  occur.
- A log sink can provide a parser for extraction of
  previously written error messages. This enables a server
  instance to read messages written to an error log file
  by the previous instance and store them in the
  [`error_log`](performance-schema-error-log-table.md "29.12.21.2 The error_log Table") table. Messages
  written during shutdown by the previous instance may be
  useful for diagnosing why shutdown occurred.

Currently, the traditional-format
`log_sink_internal` and JSON-format
`log_sink_json` sinks support writing new
events to the [`error_log`](performance-schema-error-log-table.md "29.12.21.2 The error_log Table") table
and provide a parser for reading previously written error
log files.

The [`log_error_services`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_log_error_services)
system variable controls which log components to enable for
error logging. Its value is a pipeline of log filter and log
sink components to be executed in left-to-right order when
error events occur. The
[`log_error_services`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_log_error_services) value
pertains to populating the
[`error_log`](performance-schema-error-log-table.md "29.12.21.2 The error_log Table") table as follows:

- At startup, the server examines the
  [`log_error_services`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_log_error_services)
  value and chooses from it the leftmost log sink that
  satisfies these conditions:

  - A sink that supports the
    [`error_log`](performance-schema-error-log-table.md "29.12.21.2 The error_log Table") table and
    provides a parser.
  - If none, a sink that supports the
    [`error_log`](performance-schema-error-log-table.md "29.12.21.2 The error_log Table") table but
    provides no parser.

  If no log sink satisfies those conditions, the
  [`error_log`](performance-schema-error-log-table.md "29.12.21.2 The error_log Table") table remains
  empty. Otherwise, if the sink provides a parser and log
  configuration enables a previously written error log
  file to be found, the server uses the sink parser to
  read the last part of the file and writes the old events
  it contains to the table. The sink then writes new error
  events to the table as they occur.
- At runtime, if the value of
  [`log_error_services`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_log_error_services)
  changes, the server again examines it, this time looking
  for the leftmost enabled log sink that supports the
  [`error_log`](performance-schema-error-log-table.md "29.12.21.2 The error_log Table") table, regardless
  of whether it provides a parser.

  If no such log sink exists, no additional error events
  are written to the
  [`error_log`](performance-schema-error-log-table.md "29.12.21.2 The error_log Table") table. Otherwise,
  the newly configured sink writes new error events to the
  table as they occur.

Any configuration that affects output written to the error
log affects [`error_log`](performance-schema-error-log-table.md "29.12.21.2 The error_log Table") table
contents. This includes settings such as those for
verbosity, message suppression, and message filtering. It
also applies to information read at startup from a previous
log file. For example, messages not written during a
previous server instance configured with low verbosity do
not become available if the file is read by a current
instance configured with higher verbosity.

The [`error_log`](performance-schema-error-log-table.md "29.12.21.2 The error_log Table") table is a view
on a fixed-size, in-memory ring buffer, with old events
automatically discarded as necessary to make room for new
ones. As shown in the following table, several status
variables provide information about ongoing
[`error_log`](performance-schema-error-log-table.md "29.12.21.2 The error_log Table") operation.

| Status Variable | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| [`Error_log_buffered_bytes`](server-status-variables.md#statvar_Error_log_buffered_bytes) | Bytes used in table |
| [`Error_log_buffered_events`](server-status-variables.md#statvar_Error_log_buffered_events) | Events present in table |
| [`Error_log_expired_events`](server-status-variables.md#statvar_Error_log_expired_events) | Events discarded from table |
| [`Error_log_latest_write`](server-status-variables.md#statvar_Error_log_latest_write) | Time of last write to table |
