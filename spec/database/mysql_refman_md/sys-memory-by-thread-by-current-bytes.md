#### 30.4.3.17 The memory\_by\_thread\_by\_current\_bytes and x$memory\_by\_thread\_by\_current\_bytes Views

These views summarize memory use, grouped by thread. By
default, rows are sorted by descending amount of memory used.

[`x$memory_by_thread_by_current_bytes`](sys-memory-by-thread-by-current-bytes.md "30.4.3.17 The memory_by_thread_by_current_bytes and x$memory_by_thread_by_current_bytes Views")
views have these columns:

- `thread_id`

  The thread ID.
- `user`

- `current_count_used`

  The current number of allocated memory blocks that have
  not been freed yet for the thread.
- `current_allocated`

  The current number of allocated bytes that have not been
  freed yet for the thread.
- `current_avg_alloc`

  The current number of allocated bytes per memory block for
  the thread.
