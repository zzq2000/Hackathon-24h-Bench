#### 17.20.6.5 Adapting DML Statements to memcached Operations

Benchmarks suggest that the `daemon_memcached`
plugin speeds up [DML](glossary.md#glos_dml "DML") operations
(inserts, updates, and deletes) more than it speeds up queries.
Therefore, consider focussing initial development efforts on
write-intensive applications that are I/O-bound, and look for
opportunities to use MySQL with the
`daemon_memcached` plugin for new
write-intensive applications.

Single-row DML statements are the easiest types of statements to
turn into `memcached` operations.
`INSERT` becomes `add`,
`UPDATE` becomes `set`,
`incr` or `decr`, and
`DELETE` becomes `delete`.
These operations are guaranteed to only affect one row when
issued through the **memcached** interface,
because the *`key`* is unique within the
table.

In the following SQL examples, `t1` refers to
the table used for **memcached** operations,
based on the configuration in the
`innodb_memcache.containers` table.
`key` refers to the column listed under
`key_columns`, and `val`
refers to the column listed under
`value_columns`.

```sql
INSERT INTO t1 (key,val) VALUES (some_key,some_value);
SELECT val FROM t1 WHERE key = some_key;
UPDATE t1 SET val = new_value WHERE key = some_key;
UPDATE t1 SET val = val + x WHERE key = some_key;
DELETE FROM t1 WHERE key = some_key;
```

The following [`TRUNCATE TABLE`](truncate-table.md "15.1.37 TRUNCATE TABLE Statement") and
[`DELETE`](delete.md "15.2.2 DELETE Statement") statements, which remove
all rows from the table, correspond to the
`flush_all` operation, where
`t1` is configured as the table for
**memcached** operations, as in the previous
example.

```sql
TRUNCATE TABLE t1;
DELETE FROM t1;
```
