[20.7.2.2 Group Replication Throttling](group-replication-throttling.md)

MySQL Group Replication ensures that a transaction commits only
after a majority of the members in a group have received it and
agreed on the relative order amongst all transactions sent
concurrently. This approach works well if the total number of
writes to the group does not exceed the write capacity of any
member in the group. If it does, and some members have less write
throughput than others—particularly less than the writer
members—these members may start lagging behind the writers.

When some members lag behind the rest of the group, reads on such
members may externalize very old data. Depending on why the member
is lagging behind, other members in the group may have to save
more or less of the replication context to be able to fulfil
potential data transfer requests from the slow member.

The replication protocol provides a mechanism to avoid having too
much distance, in terms of transactions applied, between fast and
slow members. This is known as the flow control mechanism, which
has the following objectives:

1. To keep members close, to minimize buffering and
   desynchronization between them
2. To adapt quickly to changing conditions like different
   workloads or more writers in the group
3. To give each member a share of the available write capacity
4. Not to reduce throughput more than strictly necessary to avoid
   wasting resources

Given the design of Group Replication, the decision whether to
throttle, or not, may be made taking into account two work queues,
the certification queue, and the binary log applier queue.
Whenever the size of one of these queues exceeds the user-defined
threshold, the throttling mechanism is triggered.

Flow control depends on two basic mechanisms:

1. Monitoring of members to collect statistics on throughput and
   queue sizes of all group members to make educated guesses
   concerning the maximum write pressure to which each member
   should be subjected
2. Throttling of members that are trying to write beyond their
   alloted shares of the available capacity at each moment in
   time
