### 25.3.6 Safe Shutdown and Restart of NDB Cluster

To shut down the cluster, enter the following command in a shell
on the machine hosting the management node:

```terminal
$> ndb_mgm -e shutdown
```

The `-e` option here is used to pass a command to
the [**ndb\_mgm**](mysql-cluster-programs-ndb-mgm.md "25.5.5 ndb_mgm — The NDB Cluster Management Client") client from the shell. The command
causes the [**ndb\_mgm**](mysql-cluster-programs-ndb-mgm.md "25.5.5 ndb_mgm — The NDB Cluster Management Client"),
[**ndb\_mgmd**](mysql-cluster-programs-ndb-mgmd.md "25.5.4 ndb_mgmd — The NDB Cluster Management Server Daemon"), and any [**ndbd**](mysql-cluster-programs-ndbd.md "25.5.1 ndbd — The NDB Cluster Data Node Daemon") or
[**ndbmtd**](mysql-cluster-programs-ndbmtd.md "25.5.3 ndbmtd — The NDB Cluster Data Node Daemon (Multi-Threaded)") processes to terminate gracefully. Any
SQL nodes can be terminated using [**mysqladmin
shutdown**](mysqladmin.md "6.5.2 mysqladmin — A MySQL Server Administration Program") and other means. On Windows platforms, assuming
that you have installed the SQL node as a Windows service, you can
use **SC STOP
*`service_name`*** or **NET
STOP *`service_name`***.

To restart the cluster on Unix platforms, run these commands:

- On the management host (`198.51.100.10` in
  our example setup):

  ```terminal
  $> ndb_mgmd -f /var/lib/mysql-cluster/config.ini
  ```
- On each of the data node hosts
  (`198.51.100.30` and
  `198.51.100.40`):

  ```terminal
  $> ndbd
  ```
- Use the [**ndb\_mgm**](mysql-cluster-programs-ndb-mgm.md "25.5.5 ndb_mgm — The NDB Cluster Management Client") client to verify that both
  data nodes have started successfully.
- On the SQL host (`198.51.100.20`):

  ```terminal
  $> mysqld_safe &
  ```

On Windows platforms, assuming that you have installed all NDB
Cluster processes as Windows services using the default service
names (see
[Section 25.3.2.4, “Installing NDB Cluster Processes as Windows Services”](mysql-cluster-install-windows-service.md "25.3.2.4 Installing NDB Cluster Processes as Windows Services")), you can
restart the cluster as follows:

- On the management host (`198.51.100.10` in
  our example setup), execute the following command:

  ```terminal
  C:\> SC START ndb_mgmd
  ```
- On each of the data node hosts
  (`198.51.100.30` and
  `198.51.100.40`), execute the following
  command:

  ```terminal
  C:\> SC START ndbd
  ```
- On the management node host, use the
  [**ndb\_mgm**](mysql-cluster-programs-ndb-mgm.md "25.5.5 ndb_mgm — The NDB Cluster Management Client") client to verify that the
  management node and both data nodes have started successfully
  (see
  [Section 25.3.2.3, “Initial Startup of NDB Cluster on Windows”](mysql-cluster-install-windows-initial-start.md "25.3.2.3 Initial Startup of NDB Cluster on Windows")).
- On the SQL node host (`198.51.100.20`),
  execute the following command:

  ```terminal
  C:\> SC START mysql
  ```

In a production setting, it is usually not desirable to shut down
the cluster completely. In many cases, even when making
configuration changes, or performing upgrades to the cluster
hardware or software (or both), which require shutting down
individual host machines, it is possible to do so without shutting
down the cluster as a whole by performing a
rolling restart of the
cluster. For more information about doing this, see
[Section 25.6.5, “Performing a Rolling Restart of an NDB Cluster”](mysql-cluster-rolling-restart.md "25.6.5 Performing a Rolling Restart of an NDB Cluster").
