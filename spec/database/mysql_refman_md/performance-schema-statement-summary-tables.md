#### 29.12.20.3 Statement Summary Tables

The Performance Schema maintains tables for collecting current
and recent statement events, and aggregates that information
in summary tables.
[Section 29.12.6, “Performance Schema Statement Event Tables”](performance-schema-statement-tables.md "29.12.6 Performance Schema Statement Event Tables")
describes the events on which statement summaries are based.
See that discussion for information about the content of
statement events, the current and historical statement event
tables, and how to control statement event collection, which
is partially disabled by default.

Example statement event summary information:

```sql

       FROM performance_schema.events_statements_summary_global_by_event_name\G

Each statement summary table has one or more grouping columns
to indicate how the table aggregates events. Event names refer
to names of event instruments in the
[`setup_instruments`](performance-schema-setup-instruments-table.md "29.12.2.3 The setup_instruments Table") table:

- [`events_statements_summary_by_account_by_event_name`](performance-schema-statement-summary-tables.md "29.12.20.3 Statement Summary Tables")
  has `EVENT_NAME`,
  `USER`, and `HOST`
  columns. Each row summarizes events for a given account
  (user and host combination) and event name.
- [`events_statements_summary_by_digest`](performance-schema-statement-summary-tables.md "29.12.20.3 Statement Summary Tables")
  has `SCHEMA_NAME` and
  `DIGEST` columns. Each row summarizes
  events per schema and digest value. (The
  `DIGEST_TEXT` column contains the
  corresponding normalized statement digest text, but is
  neither a grouping nor a summary column. The
  `QUERY_SAMPLE_TEXT`,
  `QUERY_SAMPLE_SEEN`, and
  `QUERY_SAMPLE_TIMER_WAIT` columns also
  are neither grouping nor summary columns; they support
  statement sampling.)

  The maximum number of rows in the table is autosized at
  server startup. To set this maximum explicitly, set the
  [`performance_schema_digests_size`](performance-schema-system-variables.md#sysvar_performance_schema_digests_size)
  system variable at server startup.
- [`events_statements_summary_by_host_by_event_name`](performance-schema-statement-summary-tables.md "29.12.20.3 Statement Summary Tables")
  has `EVENT_NAME` and
  `HOST` columns. Each row summarizes
  events for a given host and event name.
- [`events_statements_summary_by_program`](performance-schema-statement-summary-tables.md "29.12.20.3 Statement Summary Tables")
  has `OBJECT_TYPE`,
  `OBJECT_SCHEMA`, and
  `OBJECT_NAME` columns. Each row
  summarizes events for a given stored program (stored
  procedure or function, trigger, or event).
- [`events_statements_summary_by_thread_by_event_name`](performance-schema-statement-summary-tables.md "29.12.20.3 Statement Summary Tables")
  has `THREAD_ID` and
  `EVENT_NAME` columns. Each row summarizes
  events for a given thread and event name.
- [`events_statements_summary_by_user_by_event_name`](performance-schema-statement-summary-tables.md "29.12.20.3 Statement Summary Tables")
  has `EVENT_NAME` and
  `USER` columns. Each row summarizes
  events for a given user and event name.
- [`events_statements_summary_global_by_event_name`](performance-schema-statement-summary-tables.md "29.12.20.3 Statement Summary Tables")
  has an `EVENT_NAME` column. Each row
  summarizes events for a given event name.
- [`prepared_statements_instances`](performance-schema-prepared-statements-instances-table.md "29.12.6.4 The prepared_statements_instances Table")
  has an `OBJECT_INSTANCE_BEGIN` column.
  Each row summarizes events for a given prepared statement.

Each statement summary table has these summary columns
containing aggregated values (with exceptions as noted):

- `COUNT_STAR`,
  `SUM_TIMER_WAIT`,
  `MIN_TIMER_WAIT`,
  `AVG_TIMER_WAIT`,
  `MAX_TIMER_WAIT`

  These columns are analogous to the columns of the same
  names in the wait event summary tables (see
  [Section 29.12.20.1, “Wait Event Summary Tables”](performance-schema-wait-summary-tables.md "29.12.20.1 Wait Event Summary Tables")),
  except that the statement summary tables aggregate events
  from
  [`events_statements_current`](performance-schema-events-statements-current-table.md "29.12.6.1 The events_statements_current Table")
  rather than
  [`events_waits_current`](performance-schema-events-waits-current-table.md "29.12.4.1 The events_waits_current Table").

  The
  [`prepared_statements_instances`](performance-schema-prepared-statements-instances-table.md "29.12.6.4 The prepared_statements_instances Table")
  table does not have these columns.
- `SUM_xxx`

  The aggregate of the corresponding
  *`xxx`* column in the
  [`events_statements_current`](performance-schema-events-statements-current-table.md "29.12.6.1 The events_statements_current Table")
  table. For example, the `SUM_LOCK_TIME`
  and `SUM_ERRORS` columns in statement
  summary tables are the aggregates of the
  `LOCK_TIME` and `ERRORS`
  columns in
  [`events_statements_current`](performance-schema-events-statements-current-table.md "29.12.6.1 The events_statements_current Table")
  table.
- `MAX_CONTROLLED_MEMORY`

  Reports the maximum amount of controlled memory used by a
  statement during execution.

  This column was added in MySQL 8.0.31.
- `MAX_TOTAL_MEMORY`

  Reports the maximum amount of memory used by a statement
  during execution.

  This column was added in MySQL 8.0.31.
- `COUNT_SECONDARY`

  The number of times a query was processed on the
  `SECONDARY` engine. For use with MySQL HeatWave Service
  and MySQL HeatWave, where the `PRIMARY` engine
  is `InnoDB` and the
  `SECONDARY` engine is MySQL HeatWave
  (`RAPID`). For MySQL Community Edition Server, MySQL Enterprise Edition Server
  (on-premise), and MySQL HeatWave Service without MySQL HeatWave, queries are
  always processed on the `PRIMARY` engine,
  which means the value is always 0 on these MySQL Servers.
  The `COUNT_SECONDARY` column was added in
  MySQL 8.0.29.

The
[`events_statements_summary_by_digest`](performance-schema-statement-summary-tables.md "29.12.20.3 Statement Summary Tables")
table has these additional summary columns:

- `FIRST_SEEN`,
  `LAST_SEEN`

  Timestamps indicating when statements with the given
  digest value were first seen and most recently seen.
- `QUANTILE_95`: The 95th percentile of the
  statement latency, in picoseconds. This percentile is a
  high estimate, computed from the histogram data collected.
  In other words, for a given digest, 95% of the statements
  measured have a latency lower than
  `QUANTILE_95`.

  For access to the histogram data, use the tables described
  in
  [Section 29.12.20.4, “Statement Histogram Summary Tables”](performance-schema-statement-histogram-summary-tables.md "29.12.20.4 Statement Histogram Summary Tables").
- `QUANTILE_99`: Similar to
  `QUANTILE_95`, but for the 99th
  percentile.
- `QUANTILE_999`: Similar to
  `QUANTILE_95`, but for the 99.9th
  percentile.

The
[`events_statements_summary_by_digest`](performance-schema-statement-summary-tables.md "29.12.20.3 Statement Summary Tables")
table contains the following columns. These are neither
grouping nor summary columns; they support statement sampling:

- `QUERY_SAMPLE_TEXT`

  A sample SQL statement that produces the digest value in
  the row. This column enables applications to access, for a
  given digest value, a statement actually seen by the
  server that produces that digest. One use for this might
  be to run [`EXPLAIN`](explain.md "15.8.2 EXPLAIN Statement") on the
  statement to examine the execution plan for a
  representative statement associated with a frequently
  occurring digest.

  When the `QUERY_SAMPLE_TEXT` column is
  assigned a value, the `QUERY_SAMPLE_SEEN`
  and `QUERY_SAMPLE_TIMER_WAIT` columns are
  assigned values as well.

  The maximum space available for statement display is 1024
  bytes by default. To change this value, set the
  [`performance_schema_max_sql_text_length`](performance-schema-system-variables.md#sysvar_performance_schema_max_sql_text_length)
  system variable at server startup. (Changing this value
  affects columns in other Performance Schema tables as
  well. See
  [Section 29.10, “Performance Schema Statement Digests and Sampling”](performance-schema-statement-digests.md "29.10 Performance Schema Statement Digests and Sampling").)

  For information about statement sampling, see
  [Section 29.10, “Performance Schema Statement Digests and Sampling”](performance-schema-statement-digests.md "29.10 Performance Schema Statement Digests and Sampling").
- `QUERY_SAMPLE_SEEN`

  A timestamp indicating when the statement in the
  `QUERY_SAMPLE_TEXT` column was seen.
- `QUERY_SAMPLE_TIMER_WAIT`

  The wait time for the sample statement in the
  `QUERY_SAMPLE_TEXT` column.

The
[`events_statements_summary_by_program`](performance-schema-statement-summary-tables.md "29.12.20.3 Statement Summary Tables")
table has these additional summary columns:

- `COUNT_STATEMENTS`,
  `SUM_STATEMENTS_WAIT`,
  `MIN_STATEMENTS_WAIT`,
  `AVG_STATEMENTS_WAIT`,
  `MAX_STATEMENTS_WAIT`

  Statistics about nested statements invoked during stored
  program execution.

The [`prepared_statements_instances`](performance-schema-prepared-statements-instances-table.md "29.12.6.4 The prepared_statements_instances Table")
table has these additional summary columns:

- `COUNT_EXECUTE`,
  `SUM_TIMER_EXECUTE`,
  `MIN_TIMER_EXECUTE`,
  `AVG_TIMER_EXECUTE`,
  `MAX_TIMER_EXECUTE`

  Aggregated statistics for executions of the prepared
  statement.

The statement summary tables have these indexes:

- [`events_transactions_summary_by_account_by_event_name`](performance-schema-transaction-summary-tables.md "29.12.20.5 Transaction Summary Tables"):

  - Primary key on (`USER`,
    `HOST`,
    `EVENT_NAME`)
- [`events_statements_summary_by_digest`](performance-schema-statement-summary-tables.md "29.12.20.3 Statement Summary Tables"):

  - Primary key on (`SCHEMA_NAME`,
    `DIGEST`)
- [`events_transactions_summary_by_host_by_event_name`](performance-schema-transaction-summary-tables.md "29.12.20.5 Transaction Summary Tables"):

  - Primary key on (`HOST`,
    `EVENT_NAME`)
- [`events_statements_summary_by_program`](performance-schema-statement-summary-tables.md "29.12.20.3 Statement Summary Tables"):

  - Primary key on (`OBJECT_TYPE`,
    `OBJECT_SCHEMA`,
    `OBJECT_NAME`)
- [`events_statements_summary_by_thread_by_event_name`](performance-schema-statement-summary-tables.md "29.12.20.3 Statement Summary Tables"):

  - Primary key on (`THREAD_ID`,
    `EVENT_NAME`)
- [`events_transactions_summary_by_user_by_event_name`](performance-schema-transaction-summary-tables.md "29.12.20.5 Transaction Summary Tables"):

  - Primary key on (`USER`,
    `EVENT_NAME`)
- [`events_statements_summary_global_by_event_name`](performance-schema-statement-summary-tables.md "29.12.20.3 Statement Summary Tables"):

  - Primary key on (`EVENT_NAME`)

[`TRUNCATE TABLE`](truncate-table.md "15.1.37 TRUNCATE TABLE Statement") is permitted for
statement summary tables. It has these effects:

- For
  [`events_statements_summary_by_digest`](performance-schema-statement-summary-tables.md "29.12.20.3 Statement Summary Tables"),
  it removes the rows.
- For other summary tables not aggregated by account, host,
  or user, truncation resets the summary columns to zero
  rather than removing rows.
- For other summary tables aggregated by account, host, or
  user, truncation removes rows for accounts, hosts, or
  users with no connections, and resets the summary columns
  to zero for the remaining rows.

In addition, each statement summary table that is aggregated
by account, host, user, or thread is implicitly truncated by
truncation of the connection table on which it depends, or
truncation of
[`events_statements_summary_global_by_event_name`](performance-schema-statement-summary-tables.md "29.12.20.3 Statement Summary Tables").
For details, see
[Section 29.12.8, “Performance Schema Connection Tables”](performance-schema-connection-tables.md "29.12.8 Performance Schema Connection Tables").

In addition, truncating
[`events_statements_summary_by_digest`](performance-schema-statement-summary-tables.md "29.12.20.3 Statement Summary Tables")
implicitly truncates
[`events_statements_histogram_by_digest`](performance-schema-statement-histogram-summary-tables.md "29.12.20.4 Statement Histogram Summary Tables"),
and truncating
[`events_statements_summary_global_by_event_name`](performance-schema-statement-summary-tables.md "29.12.20.3 Statement Summary Tables")
implicitly truncates
[`events_statements_histogram_global`](performance-schema-statement-histogram-summary-tables.md "29.12.20.4 Statement Histogram Summary Tables").

##### Statement Digest Aggregation Rules

If the `statements_digest` consumer is
enabled, aggregation into
[`events_statements_summary_by_digest`](performance-schema-statement-summary-tables.md "29.12.20.3 Statement Summary Tables")
occurs as follows when a statement completes. Aggregation is
based on the `DIGEST` value computed for
the statement.

- If a
  [`events_statements_summary_by_digest`](performance-schema-statement-summary-tables.md "29.12.20.3 Statement Summary Tables")
  row already exists with the digest value for the
  statement that just completed, statistics for the
  statement are aggregated to that row. The
  `LAST_SEEN` column is updated to the
  current time.
- If no row has the digest value for the statement that
  just completed, and the table is not full, a new row is
  created for the statement. The
  `FIRST_SEEN` and
  `LAST_SEEN` columns are initialized
  with the current time.
- If no row has the statement digest value for the
  statement that just completed, and the table is full,
  the statistics for the statement that just completed are
  added to a special “catch-all” row with
  `DIGEST` = `NULL`,
  which is created if necessary. If the row is created,
  the `FIRST_SEEN` and
  `LAST_SEEN` columns are initialized
  with the current time. Otherwise, the
  `LAST_SEEN` column is updated with the
  current time.

The row with `DIGEST` =
`NULL` is maintained because Performance
Schema tables have a maximum size due to memory constraints.
The `DIGEST` = `NULL` row
permits digests that do not match other rows to be counted
even if the summary table is full, using a common
“other” bucket. This row helps you estimate
whether the digest summary is representative:

- A `DIGEST` = `NULL`
  row that has a `COUNT_STAR` value that
  represents 5% of all digests shows that the digest
  summary table is very representative; the other rows
  cover 95% of the statements seen.
- A `DIGEST` = `NULL`
  row that has a `COUNT_STAR` value that
  represents 50% of all digests shows that the digest
  summary table is not very representative; the other rows
  cover only half the statements seen. Most likely the DBA
  should increase the maximum table size so that more of
  the rows counted in the `DIGEST` =
  `NULL` row would be counted using more
  specific rows instead. By default, the table is
  autosized, but if this size is too small, set the
  [`performance_schema_digests_size`](performance-schema-system-variables.md#sysvar_performance_schema_digests_size)
  system variable to a larger value at server startup.

##### Stored Program Instrumentation Behavior

For stored program types for which instrumentation is
enabled in the [`setup_objects`](performance-schema-setup-objects-table.md "29.12.2.4 The setup_objects Table")
table,
[`events_statements_summary_by_program`](performance-schema-statement-summary-tables.md "29.12.20.3 Statement Summary Tables")
maintains statistics for stored programs as follows:

- A row is added for an object when it is first used in
  the server.
- The row for an object is removed when the object is
  dropped.
- Statistics are aggregated in the row for an object as it
  executes.
