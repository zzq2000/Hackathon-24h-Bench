#### 19.4.9.1 Asynchronous Connection Failover for Sources

To activate asynchronous connection failover for a replication
channel set `SOURCE_CONNECTION_AUTO_FAILOVER=1`
on the [`CHANGE REPLICATION SOURCE
TO`](change-replication-source-to.md "15.4.2.3 CHANGE REPLICATION SOURCE TO Statement") statement (from MySQL 8.0.23) or
[`CHANGE MASTER TO`](change-master-to.md "15.4.2.1 CHANGE MASTER TO Statement") statement
(before MySQL 8.0.23) for the channel. GTID auto-positioning
must be in use for the channel (`SOURCE_AUTO_POSITION =
1` | `MASTER_AUTO_POSITION = 1`).

Important

When the existing connection to a source fails, the replica
first retries the same connection the number of times
specified by the `SOURCE_RETRY_COUNT` |
`MASTER_RETRY_COUNT` option of the
[`CHANGE REPLICATION SOURCE TO`](change-replication-source-to.md "15.4.2.3 CHANGE REPLICATION SOURCE TO Statement") |
[`CHANGE MASTER TO`](change-master-to.md "15.4.2.1 CHANGE MASTER TO Statement") statement. The
interval between attempts is set by the
`SOURCE_CONNECT_RETRY` |
`MASTER_CONNECT_RETRY` option. When these
attempts are exhausted, the asynchronous connection failover
mechanism takes over. Note that the defaults for these
options, which were designed for a connection to a single
source, make the replica retry the same connection for 60
days. To ensure that the asynchronous connection failover
mechanism can be activated promptly, set
`SOURCE_RETRY_COUNT` |
`MASTER_RETRY_COUNT` and
`SOURCE_CONNECT_RETRY` |
`MASTER_CONNECT_RETRY` to minimal numbers
that just allow a few retry attempts with the same source, in
case the connection failure is caused by a transient network
outage. Suitable values are
`SOURCE_RETRY_COUNT=3` |
`MASTER_RETRY_COUNT=3` and
`SOURCE_CONNECT_RETRY=10` |
`MASTER_CONNECT_RETRY=10`, which make the
replica retry the connection 3 times with 10-second intervals
between.

You also need to set the source list for the replication
channel, to specify the sources that are available for failover.
You set and manage source lists using the
[`asynchronous_connection_failover_add_source`](replication-functions-async-failover.md#function_asynchronous-connection-failover-add-source)
and
[`asynchronous_connection_failover_delete_source`](replication-functions-async-failover.md#function_asynchronous-connection-failover-delete-source)
functions to add and remove single replication source servers.
To add and remove managed groups of servers, use the
[`asynchronous_connection_failover_add_managed`](replication-functions-async-failover.md#function_asynchronous-connection-failover-add-managed)
and
[`asynchronous_connection_failover_delete_managed`](replication-functions-async-failover.md#function_asynchronous-connection-failover-delete-managed)
functions instead.

The functions name the relevant replication channel and specify
the host name, port number, network namespace, and weighted
priority (1-100, with 100 being the highest priority) of a MySQL
instance to add to or delete from the channel's source list. For
a managed group, you also specify the type of managed service
(currently only Group Replication is available), and the
identifier of the managed group (for Group Replication, this is
the value of the
[`group_replication_group_name`](group-replication-system-variables.md#sysvar_group_replication_group_name)
system variable). When you add a managed group, you only need to
add one group member, and the replica automatically adds the
rest from the current group membership. When you delete a
managed group, you delete the entire group together.

In MySQL 8.0.22, the asynchronous connection failover mechanism
is activated following the failure of the replica's connection
to the source, and it issues a [`START
REPLICA`](start-replica.md "15.4.2.6 START REPLICA Statement") statement to attempt to connect to a new
source. In this release, the connection fails over if the
replication receiver thread stops due to the source stopping or
due to a network failure. The connection does not fail over in
any other situations, such as when the replication threads are
stopped by a [`STOP REPLICA`](stop-replica.md "15.4.2.8 STOP REPLICA Statement")
statement.

From MySQL 8.0.23, the asynchronous connection failover
mechanism also fails over the connection if another available
server on the source list has a higher priority (weight)
setting. This feature ensures that the replica stays connected
to the most suitable source server at all times, and it applies
to both managed groups and single (non-managed) servers. For a
managed group, a source’s weight is assigned depending on
whether it is a primary or a secondary server. So assuming that
you set up the managed group to give a higher weight to a
primary and a lower weight to a secondary, when the primary
changes, the higher weight is assigned to the new primary, so
the replica changes over the connection to it. The asynchronous
connection failover mechanism additionally changes connection if
the currently connected managed source server leaves the managed
group, or is no longer in the majority in the managed group.

When failing over a connection, the source with the highest
priority (weight) setting among the alternative sources listed
in the source list for the channel is chosen for the first
connection attempt.
The replica checks first that it can connect to the source
server, or in the case of a managed group, that the source
server has `ONLINE` status in the group (not
`RECOVERING` or unavailable). If the highest
weighted source is not available, the replica tries with all the
listed sources in descending order of weight, then starts again
from the highest weighted source. If multiple sources have the
same weight, the replica orders them randomly. If the replica
needs to start working through the list again, it includes and
retries the source to which the original connection failure
occurred.

The source lists are stored in the
`mysql.replication_asynchronous_connection_failover`
and
`mysql.replication_asynchronous_connection_failover_managed`
tables, and can be viewed in the Performance Schema
[`replication_asynchronous_connection_failover`](performance-schema-replication-asynchronous-connection-failover-table.md "29.12.11.8 The replication_asynchronous_connection_failover Table")
and
[`replication_asynchronous_connection_failover_managed`](performance-schema-replication-asynchronous-connection-failover-managed-table.md "29.12.11.9 The replication_asynchronous_connection_failover_managed Table")
tables. The replica uses a monitor thread to track the
membership of managed groups and update the source list
(`thread/sql/replica_monitor`). The setting for
the
[`SOURCE_CONNECTION_AUTO_FAILOVER`](change-replication-source-to.md#crs-opt-source_connection_auto_failover)
option of the [`CHANGE REPLICATION SOURCE
TO`](change-replication-source-to.md "15.4.2.3 CHANGE REPLICATION SOURCE TO Statement") | [`CHANGE MASTER TO`](change-master-to.md "15.4.2.1 CHANGE MASTER TO Statement")
statement, and the source list, are transferred to a clone of
the replica during a remote cloning operation.
