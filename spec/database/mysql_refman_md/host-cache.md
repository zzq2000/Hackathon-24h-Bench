#### 7.1.12.3 DNS Lookups and the Host Cache

The MySQL server maintains an in-memory host cache that contains
information about clients: IP address, host name, and error
information. The Performance Schema
[`host_cache`](performance-schema-host-cache-table.md "29.12.21.3 The host_cache Table") table exposes the
contents of the host cache so that it can be examined using
[`SELECT`](select.md "15.2.13 SELECT Statement") statements. This may help
you diagnose the causes of connection problems. See
[Section 29.12.21.3, “The host\_cache Table”](performance-schema-host-cache-table.md "29.12.21.3 The host_cache Table").

The following sections discuss how the host cache works, as well
as other topics such as how to configure and monitor the cache.

##### Host Cache Operation

The server uses the host cache only for non-localhost TCP
connections. It does not use the cache for TCP connections
established using a loopback interface address (for example,
`127.0.0.1` or `::1`), or
for connections established using a Unix socket file, named
pipe, or shared memory.

The server uses the host cache for several purposes:

- By caching the results of IP-to-host name lookups, the
  server avoids doing a Domain Name System (DNS) lookup for
  each client connection. Instead, for a given host, it
  needs to perform a lookup only for the first connection
  from that host.
- The cache contains information about errors that occur
  during the client connection process. Some errors are
  considered “blocking.” If too many of these
  occur successively from a given host without a successful
  connection, the server blocks further connections from
  that host. The
  [`max_connect_errors`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_max_connect_errors) system
  variable determines the permitted number of successive
  errors before blocking occurs.

For each applicable new client connection, the server uses the
client IP address to check whether the client host name is in
the host cache. If so, the server refuses or continues to
process the connection request depending on whether or not the
host is blocked. If the host is not in the cache, the server
attempts to resolve the host name. First, it resolves the IP
address to a host name and resolves that host name back to an
IP address. Then it compares the result to the original IP
address to ensure that they are the same. The server stores
information about the result of this operation in the host
cache. If the cache is full, the least recently used entry is
discarded.

The server performs host name resolution using the
`getaddrinfo()` system call.

The server handles entries in the host cache like this:

1. When the first TCP client connection reaches the server
   from a given IP address, a new cache entry is created to
   record the client IP, host name, and client lookup
   validation flag. Initially, the host name is set to
   `NULL` and the flag is false. This entry
   is also used for subsequent client TCP connections from
   the same originating IP.
2. If the validation flag for the client IP entry is false,
   the server attempts an IP-to-host name-to-IP DNS
   resolution. If that is successful, the host name is
   updated with the resolved host name and the validation
   flag is set to true. If resolution is unsuccessful, the
   action taken depends on whether the error is permanent or
   transient. For permanent failures, the host name remains
   `NULL` and the validation flag is set to
   true. For transient failures, the host name and validation
   flag remain unchanged. (In this case, another DNS
   resolution attempt occurs the next time a client connects
   from this IP.)
3. If an error occurs while processing an incoming client
   connection from a given IP address, the server updates the
   corresponding error counters in the entry for that IP. For
   a description of the errors recorded, see
   [Section 29.12.21.3, “The host\_cache Table”](performance-schema-host-cache-table.md "29.12.21.3 The host_cache Table").

To unblock blocked hosts, flush the host cache; see
[Dealing with Blocked Hosts](host-cache.md#blocked-host "Dealing with Blocked Hosts").

It is possible for a blocked host to become unblocked even
without flushing the host cache if activity from other hosts
occurs:

- If the cache is full when a connection arrives from a
  client IP not in the cache, the server discards the least
  recently used cache entry to make room for the new entry.
- If the discarded entry is for a blocked host, that host
  becomes unblocked.

Some connection errors are not associated with TCP
connections, occur very early in the connection process (even
before an IP address is known), or are not specific to any
particular IP address (such as out-of-memory conditions). For
information about these errors, check the
[`Connection_errors_xxx`](server-status-variables.md#statvar_Connection_errors_xxx)
status variables (see
[Section 7.1.10, “Server Status Variables”](server-status-variables.md "7.1.10 Server Status Variables")).

##### Configuring the Host Cache

The host cache is enabled by default. The
[`host_cache_size`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_host_cache_size) system
variable controls its size, as well as the size of the
Performance Schema [`host_cache`](performance-schema-host-cache-table.md "29.12.21.3 The host_cache Table")
table that exposes the cache contents. The cache size can be
set at server startup and changed at runtime. For example, to
set the size to 100 at startup, put these lines in the server
`my.cnf` file:

```ini
[mysqld]
host_cache_size=200
```

To change the size to 300 at runtime, do this:

```sql
SET GLOBAL host_cache_size=300;
```

Setting `host_cache_size` to 0, either at
server startup or at runtime, disables the host cache. With
the cache disabled, the server performs a DNS lookup every
time a client connects.

Changing the cache size at runtime causes an implicit host
cache flushing operation that clears the host cache, truncates
the [`host_cache`](performance-schema-host-cache-table.md "29.12.21.3 The host_cache Table") table, and
unblocks any blocked hosts; see
[Flushing the Host Cache](host-cache.md#host-cache-flushing "Flushing the Host Cache").

Using the [`--skip-host-cache`](server-options.md#option_mysqld_skip-host-cache)
option is similar to setting the
[`host_cache_size`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_host_cache_size) system
variable to 0, but
[`host_cache_size`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_host_cache_size) is more
flexible because it can also be used to resize, enable, and
disable the host cache at runtime, not just at server startup.
Starting the server with
[`--skip-host-cache`](server-options.md#option_mysqld_skip-host-cache) does not
prevent runtime changes to the value of
[`host_cache_size`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_host_cache_size), but such
changes have no effect and the cache is not re-enabled even if
[`host_cache_size`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_host_cache_size) is set larger
than 0.

To disable DNS host name lookups, start the server with the
[`skip_name_resolve`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_skip_name_resolve) system
variable enabled. In this case, the server uses only IP
addresses and not host names to match connecting hosts to rows
in the MySQL grant tables. Only accounts specified in those
tables using IP addresses can be used. (A client may not be
able to connect if no account exists that specifies the client
IP address.)

If you have a very slow DNS and many hosts, you might be able
to improve performance either by enabling
[`skip_name_resolve`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_skip_name_resolve) to disable
DNS lookups, or by increasing the value of
[`host_cache_size`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_host_cache_size) to make the
host cache larger.

To disallow TCP/IP connections entirely, start the server with
the [`skip_networking`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_skip_networking) system
variable enabled.

To adjust the permitted number of successive connection errors
before host blocking occurs, set the
[`max_connect_errors`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_max_connect_errors) system
variable. For example, to set the value at startup put these
lines in the server `my.cnf` file:

```ini
[mysqld]
max_connect_errors=10000
```

To change the value at runtime, do this:

```sql
SET GLOBAL max_connect_errors=10000;
```

##### Monitoring the Host Cache

The Performance Schema [`host_cache`](performance-schema-host-cache-table.md "29.12.21.3 The host_cache Table")
table exposes the contents of the host cache. This table can
be examined using [`SELECT`](select.md "15.2.13 SELECT Statement")
statements, which may help you diagnose the causes of
connection problems. For information about this table, see
[Section 29.12.21.3, “The host\_cache Table”](performance-schema-host-cache-table.md "29.12.21.3 The host_cache Table").

##### Flushing the Host Cache

Flushing the host cache might be advisable or desirable under
these conditions:

- Some of your client hosts change IP address.
- The error message `Host
  'host_name' is
  blocked` occurs for connections from legitimate
  hosts. (See [Dealing with Blocked Hosts](host-cache.md#blocked-host "Dealing with Blocked Hosts").)

Flushing the host cache has these effects:

- It clears the in-memory host cache.
- It removes all rows from the Performance Schema
  [`host_cache`](performance-schema-host-cache-table.md "29.12.21.3 The host_cache Table") table that exposes
  the cache contents.
- It unblocks any blocked hosts. This enables further
  connection attempts from those hosts.

To flush the host cache, use any of these methods:

- Change the value of the
  [`host_cache_size`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_host_cache_size) system
  variable. This requires the
  [`SYSTEM_VARIABLES_ADMIN`](privileges-provided.md#priv_system-variables-admin)
  privilege (or the deprecated
  [`SUPER`](privileges-provided.md#priv_super) privilege).
- Execute a [`TRUNCATE TABLE`](truncate-table.md "15.1.37 TRUNCATE TABLE Statement")
  statement that truncates the Performance Schema
  [`host_cache`](performance-schema-host-cache-table.md "29.12.21.3 The host_cache Table") table. This
  requires the [`DROP`](privileges-provided.md#priv_drop) privilege
  for the table.
- Execute a [`FLUSH HOSTS`](flush.md#flush-hosts)
  statement. This requires the
  [`RELOAD`](privileges-provided.md#priv_reload) privilege.

  Note

  `FLUSH HOSTS` is deprecated as of MySQL
  8.0.23, and is scheduled for removal in a future
  release.
- Execute a [**mysqladmin flush-hosts**](mysqladmin.md "6.5.2 mysqladmin — A MySQL Server Administration Program")
  command. This requires the
  [`DROP`](privileges-provided.md#priv_drop) privilege for the
  Performance Schema [`host_cache`](performance-schema-host-cache-table.md "29.12.21.3 The host_cache Table")
  table or the [`RELOAD`](privileges-provided.md#priv_reload)
  privilege.

##### Dealing with Blocked Hosts

The server uses the host cache to track errors that occur
during the client connection process. If the following error
occurs, it means that [**mysqld**](mysqld.md "6.3.1 mysqld — The MySQL Server") has received
many connection requests from the given host that were
interrupted in the middle:

```none
Host 'host_name' is blocked because of many connection errors.
Unblock with 'mysqladmin flush-hosts'
```

The value of the
[`max_connect_errors`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_max_connect_errors) system
variable determines how many successive interrupted connection
requests the server permits before blocking a host. After
[`max_connect_errors`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_max_connect_errors) failed
requests without a successful connection, the server assumes
that something is wrong (for example, that someone is trying
to break in), and blocks the host from further connection
requests.

To unblock blocked hosts, flush the host cache; see
[Flushing the Host Cache](host-cache.md#host-cache-flushing "Flushing the Host Cache").

Alternatively, to avoid having the error message occur, set
[`max_connect_errors`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_max_connect_errors) as
described in [Configuring the Host Cache](host-cache.md#host-cache-configuration "Configuring the Host Cache"). The
default value of
[`max_connect_errors`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_max_connect_errors) is 100.
Increasing [`max_connect_errors`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_max_connect_errors)
to a large value makes it less likely that a host reaches the
threshold and becomes blocked. However, if the `Host
'host_name' is blocked`
error message occurs, first verify that there is nothing wrong
with TCP/IP connections from the blocked hosts. It does no
good to increase the value of
[`max_connect_errors`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_max_connect_errors) if there
are network problems.
