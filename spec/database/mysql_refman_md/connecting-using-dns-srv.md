### 6.2.6 Connecting to the Server Using DNS SRV Records

In the Domain Name System (DNS), a SRV record (service location
record) is a type of resource record that enables a client to
specify a name that indicates a service, protocol, and domain. A
DNS lookup on the name returns a reply containing the names of
multiple available servers in the domain that provide the required
service. For information about DNS SRV, including how a record
defines the preference order of the listed servers, see
[RFC 2782](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2782).

MySQL supports the use of DNS SRV records for connecting to
servers. A client that receives a DNS SRV lookup result attempts
to connect to the MySQL server on each of the listed hosts in
order of preference, based on the priority and weighting assigned
to each host by the DNS administrator. A failure to connect occurs
only if the client cannot connect to any of the servers.

When multiple MySQL instances, such as a cluster of servers,
provide the same service for your applications, DNS SRV records
can be used to assist with failover, load balancing, and
replication services. It is cumbersome for applications to
directly manage the set of candidate servers for connection
attempts, and DNS SRV records provide an alternative:

- DNS SRV records enable a DNS administrator to map a single DNS
  domain to multiple servers. DNS SRV records also can be
  updated centrally by administrators when servers are added or
  removed from the configuration or when their host names are
  changed.
- Central management of DNS SRV records eliminates the need for
  individual clients to identify each possible host in
  connection requests, or for connections to be handled by an
  additional software component. An application can use the DNS
  SRV record to obtain information about candidate MySQL
  servers, instead of managing the server information itself.
- DNS SRV records can be used in combination with connection
  pooling, in which case connections to hosts that are no longer
  in the current list of DNS SRV records are removed from the
  pool when they become idle.

MySQL supports use of DNS SRV records to connect to servers in
these contexts:

- Several MySQL Connectors implement DNS SRV support;
  connector-specific options enable requesting DNS SRV record
  lookup both for X Protocol connections and for
  classic MySQL protocol connections. For general information, see
  [Connections Using DNS SRV Records](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/x-devapi-userguide/en/connecting-dns-srv.html). For details, see the
  documentation for individual MySQL Connectors.
- The C API provides a
  [`mysql_real_connect_dns_srv()`](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/c-api/8.0/en/mysql-real-connect-dns-srv.html)
  function that is similar to
  [`mysql_real_connect()`](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/c-api/8.0/en/mysql-real-connect.html), except
  that the argument list does not specify the particular host of
  the MySQL server to connect to. Instead, it names a DNS SRV
  record that specifies a group of servers. See
  [mysql\_real\_connect\_dns\_srv()](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/c-api/8.0/en/mysql-real-connect-dns-srv.html).
- The [**mysql**](mysql.md "6.5.1 mysql — The MySQL Command-Line Client") client has a
  [`--dns-srv-name`](mysql-command-options.md#option_mysql_dns-srv-name) option to
  indicate a DNS SRV record that specifies a group of servers.
  See [Section 6.5.1, “mysql — The MySQL Command-Line Client”](mysql.md "6.5.1 mysql — The MySQL Command-Line Client").

A DNS SRV name consists of a service, protocol, and domain, with
the service and protocol each prefixed by an underscore:

```simple
_service._protocol.domain
```

The following DNS SRV record identifies multiple candidate
servers, such as might be used by clients for establishing
X Protocol connections:

```simple
Name                      TTL   Class  Priority Weight Port  Target
_mysqlx._tcp.example.com. 86400 IN SRV 0        5      33060 server1.example.com.
_mysqlx._tcp.example.com. 86400 IN SRV 0        10     33060 server2.example.com.
_mysqlx._tcp.example.com. 86400 IN SRV 10       5      33060 server3.example.com.
_mysqlx._tcp.example.com. 86400 IN SRV 20       5      33060 server4.example.com.
```

Here, `mysqlx` indicates the X Protocol service
and `tcp` indicates the TCP protocol. A client
can request this DNS SRV record using the name
`_mysqlx._tcp.example.com`. The particular syntax
for specifying the name in the connection request depends on the
type of client. For example, a client might support specifying the
name within a URI-like connection string or as a key-value pair.

A DNS SRV record for classic protocol connections might look like
this:

```simple
Name                     TTL   Class  Priority Weight  Port Target
_mysql._tcp.example.com. 86400 IN SRV 0        5       3306 server1.example.com.
_mysql._tcp.example.com. 86400 IN SRV 0        10      3306 server2.example.com.
_mysql._tcp.example.com. 86400 IN SRV 10       5       3306 server3.example.com.
_mysql._tcp.example.com. 86400 IN SRV 20       5       3306 server4.example.com.
```

Here, the name `mysql` designates the
classic MySQL protocol service, and the port is 3306 (the default
classic MySQL protocol port) rather than 33060 (the default X Protocol
port).

When DNS SRV record lookup is used, clients generally must apply
these rules for connection requests (there may be client- or
connector-specific exceptions):

- The request must specify the full DNS SRV record name, with
  the service and protocol names prefixed by underscores.
- The request must not specify multiple host names.
- The request must not specify a port number.
- Only TCP connections are supported. Unix socket files, Windows
  named pipes, and shared memory cannot be used.

X DevAPI, see [Connections Using DNS SRV Records](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/x-devapi-userguide/en/connecting-dns-srv.html).
