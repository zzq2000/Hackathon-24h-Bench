### 12.9.4 The ucs2 Character Set (UCS-2 Unicode Encoding)

Note

The `ucs2` character set is deprecated in
MySQL 8.0.28; expect it to be removed in a future MySQL
release. Please use `utf8mb4` instead.

In UCS-2, every character is represented by a 2-byte Unicode
code with the most significant byte first. For example:
`LATIN CAPITAL LETTER A` has the code
`0x0041` and it is stored as a 2-byte sequence:
`0x00 0x41`. `CYRILLIC SMALL LETTER
YERU` (Unicode `0x044B`) is stored as
a 2-byte sequence: `0x04 0x4B`. For Unicode
characters and their codes, please refer to the
[Unicode Consortium
website](http://www.unicode.org/).

The `ucs2` character set has these
characteristics:

- Supports BMP characters only (no support for supplementary
  characters)
- Uses a fixed-length 16-bit encoding and requires two bytes
  per character.
