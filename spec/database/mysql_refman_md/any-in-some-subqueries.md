#### 15.2.15.3 Subqueries with ANY, IN, or SOME

Syntax:

```sql
operand comparison_operator ANY (subquery)
operand IN (subquery)
operand comparison_operator SOME (subquery)
```

Where *`comparison_operator`* is one of
these operators:

```sql
=  >  <  >=  <=  <>  !=
```

The `ANY` keyword, which must follow a
comparison operator, means “return `TRUE`
if the comparison is `TRUE` for
`ANY` of the values in the column that the
subquery returns.” For example:

```sql
SELECT s1 FROM t1 WHERE s1 > ANY (SELECT s1 FROM t2);
```

Suppose that there is a row in table `t1`
containing `(10)`. The expression is
`TRUE` if table `t2` contains
`(21,14,7)` because there is a value
`7` in `t2` that is less than
`10`. The expression is
`FALSE` if table `t2` contains
`(20,10)`, or if table `t2` is
empty. The expression is *unknown* (that is,
`NULL`) if table `t2` contains
`(NULL,NULL,NULL)`.

When used with a subquery, the word `IN` is an
alias for `= ANY`. Thus, these two statements
are the same:

```sql
SELECT s1 FROM t1 WHERE s1 = ANY (SELECT s1 FROM t2);
SELECT s1 FROM t1 WHERE s1 IN    (SELECT s1 FROM t2);
```

`IN` and `= ANY` are not
synonyms when used with an expression list.
`IN` can take an expression list, but
`= ANY` cannot. See
[Section 14.4.2, “Comparison Functions and Operators”](comparison-operators.md "14.4.2 Comparison Functions and Operators").

`NOT IN` is not an alias for `<>
ANY`, but for `<> ALL`. See
[Section 15.2.15.4, “Subqueries with ALL”](all-subqueries.md "15.2.15.4 Subqueries with ALL").

The word `SOME` is an alias for
`ANY`. Thus, these two statements are the same:

```sql
SELECT s1 FROM t1 WHERE s1 <> ANY  (SELECT s1 FROM t2);
SELECT s1 FROM t1 WHERE s1 <> SOME (SELECT s1 FROM t2);
```

Use of the word `SOME` is rare, but this
example shows why it might be useful. To most people, the
English phrase “a is not equal to any b” means
“there is no b which is equal to a,” but that is
not what is meant by the SQL syntax. The syntax means
“there is some b to which a is not equal.” Using
`<> SOME` instead helps ensure that
everyone understands the true meaning of the query.

Beginning with MySQL 8.0.19, you can use
[`TABLE`](table.md "15.2.16 TABLE Statement") in a scalar
`IN`, `ANY`, or
`SOME` subquery provided the table contains
only a single column. If `t2` has only one
column, the statements shown previously in this section can be
written as shown here, in each case substituting `TABLE
t2` for `SELECT s1 FROM t2`:

```sql
SELECT s1 FROM t1 WHERE s1 > ANY (TABLE t2);

SELECT s1 FROM t1 WHERE s1 = ANY (TABLE t2);

SELECT s1 FROM t1 WHERE s1 IN (TABLE t2);

SELECT s1 FROM t1 WHERE s1 <> ANY  (TABLE t2);

SELECT s1 FROM t1 WHERE s1 <> SOME (TABLE t2);
```
