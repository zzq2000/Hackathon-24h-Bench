##### Monitoring Cloning Operations using Performance Schema Clone Tables

A cloning operation may take some time to complete, depending
on the amount of data and other factors related to data
transfer. You can monitor the status and progress of a cloning
operation on the recipient MySQL server instance using the
[`clone_status`](performance-schema-clone-status-table.md "29.12.19.1 The clone_status Table") and
[`clone_progress`](performance-schema-clone-progress-table.md "29.12.19.2 The clone_progress Table") Performance Schema
tables.

Note

The [`clone_status`](performance-schema-clone-status-table.md "29.12.19.1 The clone_status Table") and
[`clone_progress`](performance-schema-clone-progress-table.md "29.12.19.2 The clone_progress Table") Performance
Schema tables can be used to monitor a cloning operation on
the recipient MySQL server instance only. To monitor a
cloning operation on the donor MySQL server instance, use
the clone stage events, as described in
[Monitoring Cloning Operations Using Performance Schema Stage Events](clone-plugin-monitoring.md#clone-plugin-monitoring-stage-events "Monitoring Cloning Operations Using Performance Schema Stage Events").

- The [`clone_status`](performance-schema-clone-status-table.md "29.12.19.1 The clone_status Table") table
  provides the state of the current or last executed cloning
  operation. A clone operation has four possible states:
  `Not Started`, `In
  Progress`, `Completed`, and
  `Failed`.
- The [`clone_progress`](performance-schema-clone-progress-table.md "29.12.19.2 The clone_progress Table") table
  provides progress information for the current or last
  executed clone operation, by stage. The stages of a
  cloning operation include `DROP DATA`,
  `FILE COPY`,
  `PAGE_COPY`,
  `REDO_COPY`,
  `FILE_SYNC`, `RESTART`,
  and `RECOVERY`.

The [`SELECT`](privileges-provided.md#priv_select) and
[`EXECUTE`](privileges-provided.md#priv_execute) privileges on the
Performance Schema is required to access the Performance
Schema clone tables.

To check the state of a cloning operation:

1. Connect to the recipient MySQL server instance.
2. Query the [`clone_status`](performance-schema-clone-status-table.md "29.12.19.1 The clone_status Table") table:

   ```sql
   mysql> SELECT STATE FROM performance_schema.clone_status;
   +-----------+
   | STATE     |
   +-----------+
   | Completed |
   +-----------+
   ```

Should a failure occur during a cloning operation, you can
query the [`clone_status`](performance-schema-clone-status-table.md "29.12.19.1 The clone_status Table") table for
error information:

```sql
mysql> SELECT STATE, ERROR_NO, ERROR_MESSAGE FROM performance_schema.clone_status;
+-----------+----------+---------------+
| STATE     | ERROR_NO | ERROR_MESSAGE |
+-----------+----------+---------------+
| Failed    |      xxx | "xxxxxxxxxxx" |
+-----------+----------+---------------+
```

To review the details of each stage of a cloning operation:

1. Connect to the recipient MySQL server instance.
2. Query the [`clone_progress`](performance-schema-clone-progress-table.md "29.12.19.2 The clone_progress Table")
   table. For example, the following query provides state and
   end time data for each stage of the cloning operation:

   ```sql
   mysql> SELECT STAGE, STATE, END_TIME FROM performance_schema.clone_progress;
   +-----------+-----------+----------------------------+
   | stage     | state     | end_time                   |
   +-----------+-----------+----------------------------+
   | DROP DATA | Completed | 2019-01-27 22:45:43.141261 |
   | FILE COPY | Completed | 2019-01-27 22:45:44.457572 |
   | PAGE COPY | Completed | 2019-01-27 22:45:44.577330 |
   | REDO COPY | Completed | 2019-01-27 22:45:44.679570 |
   | FILE SYNC | Completed | 2019-01-27 22:45:44.918547 |
   | RESTART   | Completed | 2019-01-27 22:45:48.583565 |
   | RECOVERY  | Completed | 2019-01-27 22:45:49.626595 |
   +-----------+-----------+----------------------------+
   ```

   For other clone status and progress data points that you
   can monitor, refer to
   [Section 29.12.19, “Performance Schema Clone Tables”](performance-schema-clone-tables.md "29.12.19 Performance Schema Clone Tables").

##### Monitoring Cloning Operations Using Performance Schema Stage Events

A cloning operation may take some time to complete, depending
on the amount of data and other factors related to data
transfer. There are three stage events for monitoring the
progress of a cloning operation. Each stage event reports
`WORK_COMPLETED` and
`WORK_ESTIMATED` values.
Reported values are revised as the operation progresses.

This method of monitoring a cloning operation can be used on
the donor or recipient MySQL server instance.

In order of occurrence, cloning operation stage events
include:

- `stage/innodb/clone (file copy)`:
  Indicates progress of the file copy phase of the cloning
  operation.
  `WORK_ESTIMATED` and
  `WORK_COMPLETED` units
  are file chunks. The number of files to be transferred is
  known at the start of the file copy phase, and the number
  of chunks is estimated based on the number of files.
  `WORK_ESTIMATED` is set to the number of
  estimated file chunks. `WORK_COMPLETED`
  is updated after each chunk is sent.
- `stage/innodb/clone (page copy)`:
  Indicates progress of the page copy phase of cloning
  operation. `WORK_ESTIMATED` and
  `WORK_COMPLETED` units are pages. Once
  the file copy phase is completed, the number of pages to
  be transferred is known, and
  `WORK_ESTIMATED` is set to this value.
  `WORK_COMPLETED` is updated after each
  page is sent.
- `stage/innodb/clone (redo copy)`:
  Indicates progress of the redo copy phase of cloning
  operation. `WORK_ESTIMATED` and
  `WORK_COMPLETED` units are redo chunks.
  Once the page copy phase is completed, the number of redo
  chunks to be transferred is known, and
  `WORK_ESTIMATED` is set to this value.
  `WORK_COMPLETED` is updated after each
  chunk is sent.

The following example demonstrates how to enable
`stage/innodb/clone%` event instruments and
related consumer tables to monitor a cloning operation. For
information about Performance Schema stage event instruments
and related consumers, see
[Section 29.12.5, “Performance Schema Stage Event Tables”](performance-schema-stage-tables.md "29.12.5 Performance Schema Stage Event Tables").

1. Enable the `stage/innodb/clone%`
   instruments:

   ```sql
   mysql> UPDATE performance_schema.setup_instruments SET ENABLED = 'YES'
          WHERE NAME LIKE 'stage/innodb/clone%';
   ```
2. Enable the stage event consumer tables, which include
   [`events_stages_current`](performance-schema-events-stages-current-table.md "29.12.5.1 The events_stages_current Table"),
   [`events_stages_history`](performance-schema-events-stages-history-table.md "29.12.5.2 The events_stages_history Table"), and
   [`events_stages_history_long`](performance-schema-events-stages-history-long-table.md "29.12.5.3 The events_stages_history_long Table").

   ```sql
   mysql> UPDATE performance_schema.setup_consumers SET ENABLED = 'YES'
          WHERE NAME LIKE '%stages%';
   ```
3. Run a cloning operation. In this example, a local data
   directory is cloned to a directory named
   `cloned_dir`.

   ```sql
   mysql> CLONE LOCAL DATA DIRECTORY = '/path/to/cloned_dir';
   ```
4. Check the progress of the cloning operation by querying
   the Performance Schema
   [`events_stages_current`](performance-schema-events-stages-current-table.md "29.12.5.1 The events_stages_current Table") table.
   The stage event shown differs depending on the cloning
   phase that is in progress. The
   `WORK_COMPLETED` column shows the work
   completed. The `WORK_ESTIMATED` column
   shows the work required in total.

   ```sql
   mysql> SELECT EVENT_NAME, WORK_COMPLETED, WORK_ESTIMATED FROM performance_schema.events_stages_current
          WHERE EVENT_NAME LIKE 'stage/innodb/clone%';
   +--------------------------------+----------------+----------------+
   | EVENT_NAME                     | WORK_COMPLETED | WORK_ESTIMATED |
   +--------------------------------+----------------+----------------+
   | stage/innodb/clone (redo copy) |              1 |              1 |
   +--------------------------------+----------------+----------------+
   ```

   The [`events_stages_current`](performance-schema-events-stages-current-table.md "29.12.5.1 The events_stages_current Table")
   table returns an empty set if the cloning operation has
   finished. In this case, you can check the
   [`events_stages_history`](performance-schema-events-stages-history-table.md "29.12.5.2 The events_stages_history Table") table
   to view event data for the completed operation. For
   example:

   ```sql
   mysql> SELECT EVENT_NAME, WORK_COMPLETED, WORK_ESTIMATED FROM events_stages_history
          WHERE EVENT_NAME LIKE 'stage/innodb/clone%';
   +--------------------------------+----------------+----------------+
   | EVENT_NAME                     | WORK_COMPLETED | WORK_ESTIMATED |
   +--------------------------------+----------------+----------------+
   | stage/innodb/clone (file copy) |            301 |            301 |
   | stage/innodb/clone (page copy) |              0 |              0 |
   | stage/innodb/clone (redo copy) |              1 |              1 |
   +--------------------------------+----------------+----------------+
   ```

##### Monitoring Cloning Operations Using Performance Schema Clone Instrumentation

[Performance Schema](performance-schema.md "Chapter 29 MySQL Performance Schema")
provides instrumentation for advanced performance monitoring
of clone operations. To view the available clone
instrumentation, and issue the following query:

```sql
mysql> SELECT NAME,ENABLED FROM performance_schema.setup_instruments
       WHERE NAME LIKE '%clone%';
+---------------------------------------------------+---------+
| NAME                                              | ENABLED |

| stage/innodb/clone (page copy)                    | YES     |
| statement/abstract/clone                          | YES     |
| statement/clone/local                             | YES     |
| statement/clone/client                            | YES     |
| statement/clone/server                            | YES     |

| memory/clone/data                                 | YES     |
+---------------------------------------------------+---------+
```

###### Wait Instruments

Performance schema wait instruments track events that take
time. Clone wait event instruments include:

- `wait/synch/mutex/innodb/clone_snapshot_mutex`:
  Tracks wait events for the clone snapshot mutex, which
  synchronizes access to the dynamic snapshot object (on the
  donor and recipient) between multiple clone threads.
- `wait/synch/mutex/innodb/clone_sys_mutex`:
  Tracks wait events for the clone sys mutex. There is one
  clone system object in a MySQL server instance. This mutex
  synchronizes access to the clone system object on the
  donor and recipient. It is acquired by clone threads and
  other foreground and background threads.
- `wait/synch/mutex/innodb/clone_task_mutex`:
  Tracks wait events for the clone task mutex, used for
  clone task management. The
  `clone_task_mutex` is acquired by clone
  threads.
- `wait/io/file/innodb/innodb_clone_file`:
  Tracks all I/O wait operations for files that clone
  operates on.

For information about monitoring `InnoDB`
mutex waits, see
[Section 17.16.2, “Monitoring InnoDB Mutex Waits Using Performance Schema”](monitor-innodb-mutex-waits-performance-schema.md "17.16.2 Monitoring InnoDB Mutex Waits Using Performance Schema").
For information about monitoring wait events in general, see
[Section 29.12.4, “Performance Schema Wait Event Tables”](performance-schema-wait-tables.md "29.12.4 Performance Schema Wait Event Tables").

###### Stage Instruments

Performance Schema stage events track steps that occur during
the statement-execution process. Clone stage event instruments
include:

- `stage/innodb/clone (file copy)`:
  Indicates progress of the file copy phase of the cloning
  operation.
- `stage/innodb/clone (redo copy)`:
  Indicates progress of the redo copy phase of cloning
  operation.
- `stage/innodb/clone (page copy)`:
  Indicates progress of the page copy phase of cloning
  operation.

For information about monitoring cloning operations using
stage events, see
[Monitoring Cloning Operations Using Performance Schema Stage Events](clone-plugin-monitoring.md#clone-plugin-monitoring-stage-events "Monitoring Cloning Operations Using Performance Schema Stage Events"). For
general information about monitoring stage events, see
[Section 29.12.5, “Performance Schema Stage Event Tables”](performance-schema-stage-tables.md "29.12.5 Performance Schema Stage Event Tables").

###### Statement Instruments

Performance Schema statement events track statement execution.
When a clone operation is initiated, the different statement
types tracked by clone statement instruments may be executed
in parallel. You can observe these statement events in the
Performance Schema statement event tables. The number of
statements that execute depends on the
[`clone_max_concurrency`](clone-plugin-options-variables.md#sysvar_clone_max_concurrency) and
[`clone_autotune_concurrency`](clone-plugin-options-variables.md#sysvar_clone_autotune_concurrency)
settings.

Clone statement event instruments include:

- `statement/abstract/clone`: Tracks
  statement events for any clone operation before it is
  classified as a local, client, or server operation type.
- `statement/clone/local`: Tracks clone
  statement events for local clone operations; generated
  when executing a
  [`CLONE
  LOCAL`](clone.md "15.7.5 CLONE Statement") statement.
- `statement/clone/client`: Tracks remote
  cloning statement events that occur on the recipient MySQL
  server instance; generated when executing a
  [`CLONE
  INSTANCE`](clone.md "15.7.5 CLONE Statement") statement on the recipient.
- `statement/clone/server`: Tracks remote
  cloning statement events that occur on the donor MySQL
  server instance; generated when executing a
  [`CLONE
  INSTANCE`](clone.md "15.7.5 CLONE Statement") statement on the recipient.

For information about monitoring Performance Schema statement
events, see
[Section 29.12.6, “Performance Schema Statement Event Tables”](performance-schema-statement-tables.md "29.12.6 Performance Schema Statement Event Tables").

###### Memory Instruments

Performance Schema memory instruments track memory usage.
Clone memory usage instruments include:

- `memory/innodb/clone`: Tracks memory
  allocated by `InnoDB` for the dynamic
  snapshot.
- `memory/clone/data`: Tracks memory
  allocated by the clone plugin during a clone operation.

For information about monitoring memory usage using
Performance Schema, see
[Section 29.12.20.10, “Memory Summary Tables”](performance-schema-memory-summary-tables.md "29.12.20.10 Memory Summary Tables").

##### The Com\_clone Status Variable

The
`Com_clone`
status variable provides a count of
[`CLONE`](clone.md "15.7.5 CLONE Statement") statement executions.

For more information, refer to the discussion about
`Com_xxx`
statement counter variables in
[Section 7.1.10, “Server Status Variables”](server-status-variables.md "7.1.10 Server Status Variables").
