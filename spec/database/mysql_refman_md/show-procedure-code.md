#### 15.7.7.27 SHOW PROCEDURE CODE Statement

```sql
SHOW PROCEDURE CODE proc_name
```

This statement is a MySQL extension that is available only for
servers that have been built with debugging support. It displays
a representation of the internal implementation of the named
stored procedure. A similar statement, [`SHOW
FUNCTION CODE`](show-function-code.md "15.7.7.19 SHOW FUNCTION CODE Statement"), displays information about stored
functions (see [Section 15.7.7.19, “SHOW FUNCTION CODE Statement”](show-function-code.md "15.7.7.19 SHOW FUNCTION CODE Statement")).

To use either statement, you must be the user named as the
routine `DEFINER`, have the
[`SHOW_ROUTINE`](privileges-provided.md#priv_show-routine) privilege, or have
the [`SELECT`](privileges-provided.md#priv_select) privilege at the
global level.

If the named routine is available, each statement produces a
result set. Each row in the result set corresponds to one
“instruction” in the routine. The first column is
`Pos`, which is an ordinal number beginning
with 0. The second column is `Instruction`,
which contains an SQL statement (usually changed from the
original source), or a directive which has meaning only to the
stored-routine handler.

```sql
mysql> DELIMITER //
mysql> CREATE PROCEDURE p1 ()
       BEGIN
         DECLARE fanta INT DEFAULT 55;
         DROP TABLE t2;
         LOOP
           INSERT INTO t3 VALUES (fanta);
           END LOOP;
         END//
Query OK, 0 rows affected (0.01 sec)

mysql> SHOW PROCEDURE CODE p1//
+-----+----------------------------------------+
| Pos | Instruction                            |
+-----+----------------------------------------+
|   0 | set fanta@0 55                         |
|   1 | stmt 9 "DROP TABLE t2"                 |
|   2 | stmt 5 "INSERT INTO t3 VALUES (fanta)" |
|   3 | jump 2                                 |
+-----+----------------------------------------+
4 rows in set (0.00 sec)

mysql> CREATE FUNCTION test.hello (s CHAR(20))
       RETURNS CHAR(50) DETERMINISTIC
       RETURN CONCAT('Hello, ',s,'!');
Query OK, 0 rows affected (0.00 sec)

mysql> SHOW FUNCTION CODE test.hello;
+-----+---------------------------------------+
| Pos | Instruction                           |
+-----+---------------------------------------+
|   0 | freturn 254 concat('Hello, ',s@0,'!') |
+-----+---------------------------------------+
1 row in set (0.00 sec)
```

In this example, the nonexecutable `BEGIN` and
`END` statements have disappeared, and for the
`DECLARE
variable_name` statement,
only the executable part appears (the part where the default is
assigned). For each statement that is taken from source, there
is a code word `stmt` followed by a type (9
means `DROP`, 5 means
[`INSERT`](insert.md "15.2.7 INSERT Statement"), and so on). The final row
contains an instruction `jump 2`, meaning
`GOTO instruction #2`.
