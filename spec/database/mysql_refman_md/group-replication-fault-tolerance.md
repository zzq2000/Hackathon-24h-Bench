#### 20.1.4.3 Fault-tolerance

MySQL Group Replication builds on an implementation of the Paxos
distributed algorithm to provide distributed coordination
between servers. As such, it requires a majority of servers to
be active to reach quorum and thus make a decision. This has
direct impact on the number of failures the system can tolerate
without compromising itself and its overall functionality. The
number of servers (n) needed to tolerate `f`
failures is then `n = 2 x f + 1`.

In practice this means that to tolerate one failure the group
must have three servers in it. As such if one server fails,
there are still two servers to form a majority (two out of
three) and allow the system to continue to make decisions
automatically and progress. However, if a second server fails
*involuntarily*, then the group (with one
server left) blocks, because there is no majority to reach a
decision.

The following is a small table illustrating the formula above.

| Group Size | Majority | Instant Failures Tolerated |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | 1 | 0 |
| 2 | 2 | 0 |
| 3 | 2 | 1 |
| 4 | 3 | 1 |
| 5 | 3 | 2 |
| 6 | 4 | 2 |
| 7 | 4 | 3 |
