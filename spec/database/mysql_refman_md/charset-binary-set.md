### 12.10.8 The Binary Character Set

The `binary` character set is the character set
for binary strings, which are sequences of bytes. The
`binary` character set has one collation, also
named `binary`. Comparison and sorting are
based on numeric byte values, rather than on numeric character
code values (which for multibyte characters differ from numeric
byte values). For information about the differences between the
`binary` collation of the
`binary` character set and the
`_bin` collations of nonbinary character sets,
see [Section 12.8.5, “The binary Collation Compared to \_bin Collations”](charset-binary-collations.md "12.8.5 The binary Collation Compared to _bin Collations").

For the `binary` character set, the concepts of
lettercase and accent equivalence do not apply:

- For single-byte characters stored as binary strings,
  character and byte boundaries are the same, so lettercase
  and accent differences are significant in comparisons. That
  is, the `binary` collation is
  case-sensitive and accent-sensitive.

  ```sql
  mysql> SET NAMES 'binary';
  mysql> SELECT CHARSET('abc'), COLLATION('abc');
  +----------------+------------------+
  | CHARSET('abc') | COLLATION('abc') |
  +----------------+------------------+
  | binary         | binary           |
  +----------------+------------------+
  mysql> SELECT 'abc' = 'ABC', 'a' = 'ä';
  +---------------+------------+
  | 'abc' = 'ABC' | 'a' = 'ä'  |
  +---------------+------------+
  |             0 |          0 |
  +---------------+------------+
  ```
- For multibyte characters stored as binary strings, character
  and byte boundaries differ. Character boundaries are lost,
  so comparisons that depend on them are not meaningful.

To perform lettercase conversion of a binary string, first
convert it to a nonbinary string using a character set
appropriate for the data stored in the string:

```sql
mysql> SET @str = BINARY 'New York';
mysql> SELECT LOWER(@str), LOWER(CONVERT(@str USING utf8mb4));
+-------------+------------------------------------+
| LOWER(@str) | LOWER(CONVERT(@str USING utf8mb4)) |
+-------------+------------------------------------+
| New York    | new york                           |
+-------------+------------------------------------+
```

To convert a string expression to a binary string, these
constructs are equivalent:

```sql
BINARY expr
CAST(expr AS BINARY)
CONVERT(expr USING BINARY)
```

If a value is a character string literal, the
`_binary` introducer may be used to designate
it as a binary string. For example:

```sql
_binary 'a'
```

The `_binary` introducer is permitted for
hexadecimal literals and bit-value literals as well, but
unnecessary; such literals are binary strings by default.

For more information about introducers, see
[Section 12.3.8, “Character Set Introducers”](charset-introducer.md "12.3.8 Character Set Introducers").

Note

Within the [**mysql**](mysql.md "6.5.1 mysql — The MySQL Command-Line Client") client, binary strings
display using hexadecimal notation, depending on the value of
the [`--binary-as-hex`](mysql-command-options.md#option_mysql_binary-as-hex). For more
information about that option, see [Section 6.5.1, “mysql — The MySQL Command-Line Client”](mysql.md "6.5.1 mysql — The MySQL Command-Line Client").
