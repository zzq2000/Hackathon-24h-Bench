### 15.1.37 TRUNCATE TABLE Statement

```sql
TRUNCATE [TABLE] tbl_name
```

[`TRUNCATE TABLE`](truncate-table.md "15.1.37 TRUNCATE TABLE Statement") empties a table
completely. It requires the [`DROP`](privileges-provided.md#priv_drop)
privilege. Logically, [`TRUNCATE
TABLE`](truncate-table.md "15.1.37 TRUNCATE TABLE Statement") is similar to a
[`DELETE`](delete.md "15.2.2 DELETE Statement") statement that deletes all
rows, or a sequence of [`DROP TABLE`](drop-table.md "15.1.32 DROP TABLE Statement")
and [`CREATE TABLE`](create-table.md "15.1.20 CREATE TABLE Statement") statements.

To achieve high performance, [`TRUNCATE
TABLE`](truncate-table.md "15.1.37 TRUNCATE TABLE Statement") bypasses the DML method of deleting data. Thus, it
does not cause `ON DELETE` triggers to fire, it
cannot be performed for `InnoDB` tables with
parent-child foreign key relationships, and it cannot be rolled
back like a DML operation. However, `TRUNCATE
TABLE` operations on tables that use a storage engine
which supports atomic DDL are either fully committed or rolled
back if the server halts during their operation. For more
information, see [Section 15.1.1, “Atomic Data Definition Statement Support”](atomic-ddl.md "15.1.1 Atomic Data Definition Statement Support").

Although [`TRUNCATE TABLE`](truncate-table.md "15.1.37 TRUNCATE TABLE Statement") is similar
to [`DELETE`](delete.md "15.2.2 DELETE Statement"), it is classified as a
DDL statement rather than a DML statement. It differs from
[`DELETE`](delete.md "15.2.2 DELETE Statement") in the following ways:

- Truncate operations drop and re-create the table, which is
  much faster than deleting rows one by one, particularly for
  large tables.
- Truncate operations cause an implicit commit, and so cannot be
  rolled back. See [Section 15.3.3, “Statements That Cause an Implicit Commit”](implicit-commit.md "15.3.3 Statements That Cause an Implicit Commit").
- Truncation operations cannot be performed if the session holds
  an active table lock.
- [`TRUNCATE TABLE`](truncate-table.md "15.1.37 TRUNCATE TABLE Statement") fails for an
  `InnoDB` table or
  [`NDB`](mysql-cluster.md "Chapter 25 MySQL NDB Cluster 8.0") table if there are any
  `FOREIGN KEY` constraints from other tables
  that reference the table. Foreign key constraints between
  columns of the same table are permitted.
- Truncation operations do not return a meaningful value for the
  number of deleted rows. The usual result is “0 rows
  affected,” which should be interpreted as “no
  information.”
- As long as the table definition is valid, the table can be
  re-created as an empty table with
  [`TRUNCATE TABLE`](truncate-table.md "15.1.37 TRUNCATE TABLE Statement"), even if the
  data or index files have become corrupted.
- Any `AUTO_INCREMENT` value is reset to its
  start value. This is true even for `MyISAM`
  and `InnoDB`, which normally do not reuse
  sequence values.
- When used with partitioned tables,
  [`TRUNCATE TABLE`](truncate-table.md "15.1.37 TRUNCATE TABLE Statement") preserves the
  partitioning; that is, the data and index files are dropped
  and re-created, while the partition definitions are
  unaffected.
- The [`TRUNCATE TABLE`](truncate-table.md "15.1.37 TRUNCATE TABLE Statement") statement
  does not invoke `ON DELETE` triggers.
- Truncating a corrupted `InnoDB` table is
  supported.

[`TRUNCATE TABLE`](truncate-table.md "15.1.37 TRUNCATE TABLE Statement") is treated for
purposes of binary logging and replication as DDL rather than DML,
and is always logged as a statement.

[`TRUNCATE TABLE`](truncate-table.md "15.1.37 TRUNCATE TABLE Statement") for a table closes
all handlers for the table that were opened with
[`HANDLER OPEN`](handler.md "15.2.5 HANDLER Statement").

In MySQL 5.7 and earlier, on a system with a large buffer pool and
[`innodb_adaptive_hash_index`](innodb-parameters.md#sysvar_innodb_adaptive_hash_index)
enabled, a `TRUNCATE TABLE` operation could cause
a temporary drop in system performance due to an LRU scan that
occurred when removing the table's adaptive hash index entries
(Bug #68184). The remapping of [`TRUNCATE
TABLE`](truncate-table.md "15.1.37 TRUNCATE TABLE Statement") to [`DROP TABLE`](drop-table.md "15.1.32 DROP TABLE Statement") and
[`CREATE TABLE`](create-table.md "15.1.20 CREATE TABLE Statement") in MySQL 8.0 avoids
the problematic LRU scan.

[`TRUNCATE TABLE`](truncate-table.md "15.1.37 TRUNCATE TABLE Statement") can be used with
Performance Schema summary tables, but the effect is to reset the
summary columns to 0 or `NULL`, not to remove
rows. See [Section 29.12.20, “Performance Schema Summary Tables”](performance-schema-summary-tables.md "29.12.20 Performance Schema Summary Tables").

Truncating an `InnoDB` table that resides in a
file-per-table tablespace drops the existing tablespace and
creates a new one. As of MySQL 8.0.21, if the tablespace was
created with an earlier version and resides in an unknown
directory, `InnoDB` creates the new tablespace in
the default location and writes the following warning to the error
log: The DATA DIRECTORY location must be in a known
directory. The DATA DIRECTORY location will be ignored and the
file will be put into the default datadir location.
Known directories are those defined by the
[`datadir`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_datadir),
[`innodb_data_home_dir`](innodb-parameters.md#sysvar_innodb_data_home_dir), and
[`innodb_directories`](innodb-parameters.md#sysvar_innodb_directories) variables. To
have [`TRUNCATE TABLE`](truncate-table.md "15.1.37 TRUNCATE TABLE Statement") create the
tablespace in its current location, add the directory to the
[`innodb_directories`](innodb-parameters.md#sysvar_innodb_directories) setting before
running [`TRUNCATE TABLE`](truncate-table.md "15.1.37 TRUNCATE TABLE Statement").
