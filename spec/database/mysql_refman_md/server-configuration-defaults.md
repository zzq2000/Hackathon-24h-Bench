### 7.1.2 Server Configuration Defaults

The MySQL server has many operating parameters, which you can
change at server startup using command-line options or
configuration files (option files). It is also possible to change
many parameters at runtime. For general instructions on setting
parameters at startup or runtime, see
[Section 7.1.7, “Server Command Options”](server-options.md "7.1.7 Server Command Options"), and
[Section 7.1.8, “Server System Variables”](server-system-variables.md "7.1.8 Server System Variables").

On Windows, MySQL Installer interacts with the user and creates a
file named `my.ini` in the base installation
directory as the default option file.

Note

On Windows, the `.ini` or
`.cnf` option file extension might not be
displayed.

After completing the installation process, you can edit the
default option file at any time to modify the parameters used by
the server. For example, to use a parameter setting in the file
that is commented with a `#` character at the
beginning of the line, remove the `#`, and modify
the parameter value if necessary. To disable a setting, either add
a `#` to the beginning of the line or remove it.

For non-Windows platforms, no default option file is created
during either the server installation or the data directory
initialization process. Create your option file by following the
instructions given in [Section 6.2.2.2, “Using Option Files”](option-files.md "6.2.2.2 Using Option Files"). Without an
option file, the server just starts with its default
settings—see [Section 7.1.2, “Server Configuration Defaults”](server-configuration-defaults.md "7.1.2 Server Configuration Defaults")
on how to check those settings.

For additional information about option file format and syntax,
see [Section 6.2.2.2, “Using Option Files”](option-files.md "6.2.2.2 Using Option Files").
