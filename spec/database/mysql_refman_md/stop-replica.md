#### 15.4.2.8 STOP REPLICA Statement

```sql
STOP REPLICA [thread_types] [channel_option]

thread_types:
    [thread_type [, thread_type] ... ]

thread_type: IO_THREAD | SQL_THREAD

channel_option:
    FOR CHANNEL channel
```

Stops the replication threads. From MySQL 8.0.22, use
[`STOP REPLICA`](stop-replica.md "15.4.2.8 STOP REPLICA Statement") in place of
[`STOP SLAVE`](stop-slave.md "15.4.2.9 STOP SLAVE Statement"), which is now
deprecated. In releases before MySQL 8.0.22, use
[`STOP SLAVE`](stop-slave.md "15.4.2.9 STOP SLAVE Statement").

`STOP REPLICA` requires the
[`REPLICATION_SLAVE_ADMIN`](privileges-provided.md#priv_replication-slave-admin) privilege
(or the deprecated [`SUPER`](privileges-provided.md#priv_super)
privilege). Recommended best practice is to execute
`STOP REPLICA` on the replica before stopping
the replica server (see [Section 7.1.19, “The Server Shutdown Process”](server-shutdown.md "7.1.19 The Server Shutdown Process"), for
more information).

Like [`START
REPLICA`](start-replica.md "15.4.2.6 START REPLICA Statement"), this statement may be used with the
`IO_THREAD` and `SQL_THREAD`
options to name the replication thread or threads to be stopped.
Note that the Group Replication applier channel
(`group_replication_applier`) has no
replication I/O (receiver) thread, only a replication SQL
(applier) thread. Using the `SQL_THREAD` option
therefore stops this channel completely.

`STOP REPLICA` causes an implicit commit of an
ongoing transaction. See [Section 15.3.3, “Statements That Cause an Implicit Commit”](implicit-commit.md "15.3.3 Statements That Cause an Implicit Commit").

[`gtid_next`](replication-options-gtids.md#sysvar_gtid_next) must be set to
`AUTOMATIC` before issuing this statement.

You can control how long `STOP REPLICA` waits
before timing out by setting the system variable
[`rpl_stop_replica_timeout`](replication-options-replica.md#sysvar_rpl_stop_replica_timeout) (from
MySQL 8.0.26) or
[`rpl_stop_slave_timeout`](replication-options-replica.md#sysvar_rpl_stop_slave_timeout) (before
MySQL 8.0.26). This can be used to avoid deadlocks between
`STOP REPLICA` and other SQL statements using
different client connections to the replica. When the timeout
value is reached, the issuing client returns an error message
and stops waiting, but the `STOP REPLICA`
instruction remains in effect. Once the replication threads are
no longer busy, the `STOP REPLICA` statement is
executed and the replica stops.

Some [`CHANGE REPLICATION SOURCE TO`](change-replication-source-to.md "15.4.2.3 CHANGE REPLICATION SOURCE TO Statement")
| [`CHANGE MASTER TO`](change-master-to.md "15.4.2.1 CHANGE MASTER TO Statement") statements are
allowed while the replica is running, depending on the states of
the replication threads. However, using `STOP
REPLICA` prior to executing a
[`CHANGE REPLICATION SOURCE TO`](change-replication-source-to.md "15.4.2.3 CHANGE REPLICATION SOURCE TO Statement") |
[`CHANGE MASTER TO`](change-master-to.md "15.4.2.1 CHANGE MASTER TO Statement") statement in
such cases is still supported. See
[Section 15.4.2.3, “CHANGE REPLICATION SOURCE TO Statement”](change-replication-source-to.md "15.4.2.3 CHANGE REPLICATION SOURCE TO Statement"),
[Section 15.4.2.1, “CHANGE MASTER TO Statement”](change-master-to.md "15.4.2.1 CHANGE MASTER TO Statement"), and
[Section 19.4.8, “Switching Sources During Failover”](replication-solutions-switch.md "19.4.8 Switching Sources During Failover"), for more
information.

The optional `FOR CHANNEL
channel` clause enables you
to name which replication channel the statement applies to.
Providing a `FOR CHANNEL
channel` clause applies the
`STOP REPLICA` statement to a specific
replication channel. If no channel is named and no extra
channels exist, the statement applies to the default channel. If
a `STOP REPLICA` statement does not name a
channel when using multiple channels, this statement stops the
specified threads for all channels. See
[Section 19.2.2, “Replication Channels”](replication-channels.md "19.2.2 Replication Channels") for more information.

The replication channels for Group Replication
(`group_replication_applier` and
`group_replication_recovery`) are managed
automatically by the server instance. `STOP
REPLICA` cannot be used at all with the
`group_replication_recovery` channel, and
should only be used with the
`group_replication_applier` channel when Group
Replication is not running. The
`group_replication_applier` channel only has an
applier thread and has no receiver thread, so it can be stopped
if required by using the `SQL_THREAD` option
without the `IO_THREAD` option.

When the replica is multithreaded
([`replica_parallel_workers`](replication-options-replica.md#sysvar_replica_parallel_workers) or
[`slave_parallel_workers`](replication-options-replica.md#sysvar_slave_parallel_workers) is a
nonzero value), any gaps in the sequence of transactions
executed from the relay log are closed as part of stopping the
worker threads. If the replica is stopped unexpectedly (for
example due to an error in a worker thread, or another thread
issuing [`KILL`](kill.md "15.7.8.4 KILL Statement")) while a
`STOP REPLICA` statement is executing, the
sequence of executed transactions from the relay log may become
inconsistent. See
[Section 19.5.1.34, “Replication and Transaction Inconsistencies”](replication-features-transaction-inconsistencies.md "19.5.1.34 Replication and Transaction Inconsistencies"),
for more information.

When the source is using the row-based binary logging format,
you should execute `STOP REPLICA` or
`STOP REPLICA SQL_THREAD` on the replica prior
to shutting down the replica server if you are replicating any
tables that use a nontransactional storage engine. If the
current replication event group has modified one or more
nontransactional tables, `STOP REPLICA` waits
for up to 60 seconds for the event group to complete, unless you
issue a [`KILL
QUERY`](kill.md "15.7.8.4 KILL Statement") or [`KILL
CONNECTION`](kill.md "15.7.8.4 KILL Statement") statement for the replication SQL thread.
If the event group remains incomplete after the timeout, an
error message is logged.

When the source is using the statement-based binary logging
format, changing the source while it has open temporary tables
is potentially unsafe. This is one of the reasons why
statement-based replication of temporary tables is not
recommended. You can find out whether there are any temporary
tables on the replica by checking the value of
[`Replica_open_temp_tables`](server-status-variables.md#statvar_Replica_open_temp_tables) or
[`Slave_open_temp_tables`](server-status-variables.md#statvar_Slave_open_temp_tables). When
using statement-based replication, this value should be 0 before
executing [`CHANGE REPLICATION SOURCE
TO`](change-replication-source-to.md "15.4.2.3 CHANGE REPLICATION SOURCE TO Statement") | [`CHANGE MASTER TO`](change-master-to.md "15.4.2.1 CHANGE MASTER TO Statement").
If there are any temporary tables open on the replica, issuing a
[`CHANGE REPLICATION SOURCE TO`](change-replication-source-to.md "15.4.2.3 CHANGE REPLICATION SOURCE TO Statement") |
[`CHANGE MASTER TO`](change-master-to.md "15.4.2.1 CHANGE MASTER TO Statement") statement after
issuing a `STOP REPLICA` causes an
[`ER_WARN_OPEN_TEMP_TABLES_MUST_BE_ZERO`](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/mysql-errors/8.0/en/server-error-reference.html#error_er_warn_open_temp_tables_must_be_zero)
warning.
