## 29.9 Performance Schema Tables for Current and Historical Events

For wait, stage, statement, and transaction events, the
Performance Schema can monitor and store current events. In
addition, when events end, the Performance Schema can store them
in history tables. For each event type, the Performance Schema
uses three tables for storing current and historical events. The
tables have names of the following forms, where
*`xxx`* indicates the event type
(`waits`, `stages`,
`statements`, `transactions`):

- `events_xxx_current`:
  The “current events” table stores the current
  monitored event for each thread (one row per thread).
- `events_xxx_history`:
  The “recent history” table stores the most recent
  events that have ended per thread (up to a maximum number of
  rows per thread).
- `events_xxx_history_long`:
  The “long history” table stores the most recent
  events that have ended globally (across all threads, up to a
  maximum number of rows per table).

The `_current` table for each event type contains
one row per thread, so there is no system variable for configuring
its maximum size. The Performance Schema autosizes the history
tables, or the sizes can be configured explicitly at server
startup using table-specific system variables, as indicated in the
sections that describe the individual history tables. Typical
autosized values are 10 rows per thread for
`_history` tables, and 10,000 rows total for
`_history_long` tables.

For each event type, the `_current`,
`_history`, and `_history_long`
tables have the same columns. The `_current` and
`_history` tables have the same indexing. The
`_history_long` table has no indexing.

The `_current` tables show what is currently
happening within the server. When a current event ends, it is
removed from its `_current` table.

The `_history` and
`_history_long` tables show what has happened in
the recent past. When the history tables become full, old events
are discarded as new events are added. Rows expire from the
`_history` and `_history_long`
tables in different ways because the tables serve different
purposes:

- `_history` is meant to investigate individual
  threads, independently of the global server load.
- `_history_long` is meant to investigate the
  server globally, not each thread.

The difference between the two types of history tables relates to
the data retention policy. Both tables contains the same data when
an event is first seen. However, data within each table expires
differently over time, so that data might be preserved for a
longer or shorter time in each table:

- For `_history`, when the table contains the
  maximum number of rows for a given thread, the oldest thread
  row is discarded when a new row for that thread is added.
- For `_history_long`, when the table becomes
  full, the oldest row is discarded when a new row is added,
  regardless of which thread generated either row.

When a thread ends, all its rows are discarded from the
`_history` table but not from the
`_history_long` table.

The following example illustrates the differences in how events
are added to and discarded from the two types of history tables.
The principles apply equally to all event types. The example is
based on these assumptions:

- The Performance Schema is configured to retain 10 rows per
  thread in the `_history` table and 10,000
  rows total in the `_history_long` table.
- Thread A generates 1 event per second.

  Thread B generates 100 events per second.
- No other threads are running.

After 5 seconds of execution:

- A and B have generated 5 and 500 events, respectively.
- `_history` contains 5 rows for A and 10 rows
  for B. Because storage per thread is limited to 10 rows, no
  rows have been discarded for A, whereas 490 rows have been
  discarded for B.
- `_history_long` contains 5 rows for A and 500
  rows for B. Because the table has a maximum size of 10,000
  rows, no rows have been discarded for either thread.

After 5 minutes (300 seconds) of execution:

- A and B have generated 300 and 30,000 events, respectively.
- `_history` contains 10 rows for A and 10 rows
  for B. Because storage per thread is limited to 10 rows, 290
  rows have been discarded for A, whereas 29,990 rows have been
  discarded for B. Rows for A include data up to 10 seconds old,
  whereas rows for B include data up to only .1 seconds old.
- `_history_long` contains 10,000 rows. Because
  A and B together generate 101 events per second, the table
  contains data up to approximately 10,000/101 = 99 seconds old,
  with a mix of rows approximately 100 to 1 from B as opposed to
  A.
