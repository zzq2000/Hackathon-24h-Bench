### 8.4.2 Connection Control Plugins

[8.4.2.1 Connection Control Plugin Installation](connection-control-plugin-installation.md)

[8.4.2.2 Connection Control Plugin System and Status Variables](connection-control-plugin-variables.md)

MySQL Server includes a plugin library that enables administrators
to introduce an increasing delay in server response to connection
attempts after a configurable number of consecutive failed
attempts. This capability provides a deterrent that slows down
brute force attacks against MySQL user accounts. The plugin
library contains two plugins:

- `CONNECTION_CONTROL` checks incoming
  connection attempts and adds a delay to server responses as
  necessary. This plugin also exposes system variables that
  enable its operation to be configured and a status variable
  that provides rudimentary monitoring information.

  The `CONNECTION_CONTROL` plugin uses the
  audit plugin interface (see
  [Writing Audit Plugins](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/extending-mysql/8.0/en/writing-audit-plugins.html)). To collect
  information, it subscribes to the
  `MYSQL_AUDIT_CONNECTION_CLASSMASK` event
  class, and processes
  `MYSQL_AUDIT_CONNECTION_CONNECT` and
  `MYSQL_AUDIT_CONNECTION_CHANGE_USER`
  subevents to check whether the server should introduce a delay
  before responding to connection attempts.
- `CONNECTION_CONTROL_FAILED_LOGIN_ATTEMPTS`
  implements an `INFORMATION_SCHEMA` table that
  exposes more detailed monitoring information for failed
  connection attempts. For more information about this table,
  see
  [Section 28.6.2, “The INFORMATION\_SCHEMA CONNECTION\_CONTROL\_FAILED\_LOGIN\_ATTEMPTS Table”](information-schema-connection-control-failed-login-attempts-table.md "28.6.2 The INFORMATION_SCHEMA CONNECTION_CONTROL_FAILED_LOGIN_ATTEMPTS Table").

The following sections provide information about connection
control plugin installation and configuration.
