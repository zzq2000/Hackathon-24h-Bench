#### 10.4.2.1 Optimizing for Numeric Data

- For unique IDs or other values that can be represented as
  either strings or numbers, prefer numeric columns to
  string columns. Since large numeric values can be stored
  in fewer bytes than the corresponding strings, it is
  faster and takes less memory to transfer and compare them.
- If you are using numeric data, it is faster in many cases
  to access information from a database (using a live
  connection) than to access a text file. Information in the
  database is likely to be stored in a more compact format
  than in the text file, so accessing it involves fewer disk
  accesses. You also save code in your application because
  you can avoid parsing the text file to find line and
  column boundaries.
