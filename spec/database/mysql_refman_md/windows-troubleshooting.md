### 2.3.5 Troubleshooting a Microsoft Windows MySQL Server Installation

When installing and running MySQL for the first time, you may
encounter certain errors that prevent the MySQL server from
starting. This section helps you diagnose and correct some of
these errors.

Your first resource when troubleshooting server issues is the
[error log](glossary.md#glos_error_log "error log"). The MySQL server
uses the error log to record information relevant to the error
that prevents the server from starting. The error log is located
in the [data directory](glossary.md#glos_data_directory "data directory")
specified in your `my.ini` file. The default
data directory location is `C:\Program Files\MySQL\MySQL
Server 8.0\data`, or
`C:\ProgramData\Mysql` on Windows 7 and Windows
Server 2008. The `C:\ProgramData` directory is
hidden by default. You need to change your folder options to see
the directory and contents. For more information on the error log
and understanding the content, see [Section 7.4.2, “The Error Log”](error-log.md "7.4.2 The Error Log").

For information regarding possible errors, also consult the
console messages displayed when the MySQL service is starting. Use
the **SC START
*`mysqld_service_name`*** or
**NET START
*`mysqld_service_name`*** command
from the command line after installing [**mysqld**](mysqld.md "6.3.1 mysqld — The MySQL Server")
as a service to see any error messages regarding the starting of
the MySQL server as a service. See
[Section 2.3.4.8, “Starting MySQL as a Windows Service”](windows-start-service.md "2.3.4.8 Starting MySQL as a Windows Service").

The following examples show other common error messages you might
encounter when installing MySQL and starting the server for the
first time:

- If the MySQL server cannot find the `mysql`
  privileges database or other critical files, it displays these
  messages:

  ```none
  System error 1067 has occurred.
  Fatal error: Can't open and lock privilege tables:
  Table 'mysql.user' doesn't exist
  ```

  These messages often occur when the MySQL base or data
  directories are installed in different locations than the
  default locations (`C:\Program Files\MySQL\MySQL
  Server 8.0` and `C:\Program
  Files\MySQL\MySQL Server 8.0\data`,
  respectively).

  This situation can occur when MySQL is upgraded and installed
  to a new location, but the configuration file is not updated
  to reflect the new location. In addition, old and new
  configuration files might conflict. Be sure to delete or
  rename any old configuration files when upgrading MySQL.

  If you have installed MySQL to a directory other than
  `C:\Program Files\MySQL\MySQL Server
  8.0`, ensure that the MySQL server is
  aware of this through the use of a configuration
  (`my.ini`) file. Put the
  `my.ini` file in your Windows directory,
  typically `C:\WINDOWS`. To determine its
  exact location from the value of the `WINDIR`
  environment variable, issue the following command from the
  command prompt:

  ```terminal
  C:\> echo %WINDIR%
  ```

  You can create or modify an option file with any text editor,
  such as Notepad. For example, if MySQL is installed in
  `E:\mysql` and the data directory is
  `D:\MySQLdata`, you can create the option
  file and set up a `[mysqld]` section to
  specify values for the `basedir` and
  `datadir` options:

  ```ini
  [mysqld]
  # set basedir to your installation path
  basedir=E:/mysql
  # set datadir to the location of your data directory
  datadir=D:/MySQLdata
  ```

  Microsoft Windows path names are specified in option files
  using (forward) slashes rather than backslashes. If you do use
  backslashes, double them:

  ```ini
  [mysqld]
  # set basedir to your installation path
  basedir=C:\\Program Files\\MySQL\\MySQL Server 8.0
  # set datadir to the location of your data directory
  datadir=D:\\MySQLdata
  ```

  The rules for use of backslash in option file values are given
  in [Section 6.2.2.2, “Using Option Files”](option-files.md "6.2.2.2 Using Option Files").

  If you change the `datadir` value in your MySQL
  configuration file, you must move the contents of the existing
  MySQL data directory before restarting the MySQL server.

  See [Section 2.3.4.2, “Creating an Option File”](windows-create-option-file.md "2.3.4.2 Creating an Option File").
- If you reinstall or upgrade MySQL without first stopping and
  removing the existing MySQL service and install MySQL using
  the MySQL Installer, you might see this error:

  ```none
  Error: Cannot create Windows service for MySql. Error: 0
  ```

  This occurs when the Configuration Wizard tries to install the
  service and finds an existing service with the same name.

  One solution to this problem is to choose a service name other
  than `mysql` when using the configuration
  wizard. This enables the new service to be installed
  correctly, but leaves the outdated service in place. Although
  this is harmless, it is best to remove old services that are
  no longer in use.

  To permanently remove the old `mysql`
  service, execute the following command as a user with
  administrative privileges, on the command line:

  ```terminal
  C:\> SC DELETE mysql
  [SC] DeleteService SUCCESS
  ```

  If the `SC` utility is not available for your
  version of Windows, download the `delsrv`
  utility from
  <http://www.microsoft.com/windows2000/techinfo/reskit/tools/existing/delsrv-o.asp>
  and use the `delsrv mysql` syntax.
