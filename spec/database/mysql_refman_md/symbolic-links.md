You can move databases or tables from the database directory to
other locations and replace them with symbolic links to the new
locations. You might want to do this, for example, to move a
database to a file system with more free space or increase the
speed of your system by spreading your tables to different
disks.

For `InnoDB` tables, use the `DATA
DIRECTORY` clause of the [`CREATE
TABLE`](create-table.md "15.1.20 CREATE TABLE Statement") statement instead of symbolic links, as
explained in [Section 17.6.1.2, “Creating Tables Externally”](innodb-create-table-external.md "17.6.1.2 Creating Tables Externally").
This new feature is a supported, cross-platform technique.

The recommended way to do this is to symlink entire database
directories to a different disk. Symlink
`MyISAM` tables only as a last resort.

To determine the location of your data directory, use this
statement:

```sql
SHOW VARIABLES LIKE 'datadir';
```
