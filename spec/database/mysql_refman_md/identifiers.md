Certain objects within MySQL, including database, table, index,
column, alias, view, stored procedure, partition, tablespace,
resource group and other object names are known as identifiers.
This section describes the permissible syntax for identifiers in
MySQL. [Section 11.2.1, “Identifier Length Limits”](identifier-length.md "11.2.1 Identifier Length Limits"), indicates the maximum
length of each type of identifier.
[Section 11.2.3, “Identifier Case Sensitivity”](identifier-case-sensitivity.md "11.2.3 Identifier Case Sensitivity"), describes which
types of identifiers are case-sensitive and under what conditions.

An identifier may be quoted or unquoted. If an identifier contains
special characters or is a reserved word, you
*must* quote it whenever you refer to it.
(Exception: A reserved word that follows a period in a qualified
name must be an identifier, so it need not be quoted.) Reserved
words are listed at [Section 11.3, “Keywords and Reserved Words”](keywords.md "11.3 Keywords and Reserved Words").

Internally, identifiers are converted to and are stored as Unicode
(UTF-8). The permissible Unicode characters in identifiers are
those in the Basic Multilingual Plane (BMP). Supplementary
characters are not permitted. Identifiers thus may contain these
characters:

- Permitted characters in unquoted identifiers:

  - ASCII: [0-9,a-z,A-Z$\_] (basic Latin letters, digits 0-9,
    dollar, underscore)
  - Extended: U+0080 .. U+FFFF
- Permitted characters in quoted identifiers include the full
  Unicode Basic Multilingual Plane (BMP), except U+0000:

  - ASCII: U+0001 .. U+007F
  - Extended: U+0080 .. U+FFFF
- ASCII NUL (U+0000) and supplementary characters (U+10000 and
  higher) are not permitted in quoted or unquoted identifiers.
- Identifiers may begin with a digit but unless quoted may not
  consist solely of digits.
- Database, table, and column names cannot end with space
  characters.
- Beginning with MySQL 8.0.32, use of the dollar sign as the
  first character in the unquoted name of a database, table,
  view, column, stored program, or alias is deprecated and
  produces a warning. This includes such names used with
  qualifiers (see [Section 11.2.2, “Identifier Qualifiers”](identifier-qualifiers.md "11.2.2 Identifier Qualifiers")). The
  dollar sign can still be used as the leading character of such
  an identifier when it is quoted according to the rules given
  later in this section.

The identifier quote character is the backtick
(`` ` ``):

```sql
mysql> SELECT * FROM `select` WHERE `select`.id > 100;
```

If the [`ANSI_QUOTES`](sql-mode.md#sqlmode_ansi_quotes) SQL mode is
enabled, it is also permissible to quote identifiers within double
quotation marks:

```sql
mysql> CREATE TABLE "test" (col INT);
ERROR 1064: You have an error in your SQL syntax...
mysql> SET sql_mode='ANSI_QUOTES';
mysql> CREATE TABLE "test" (col INT);
Query OK, 0 rows affected (0.00 sec)
```

The [`ANSI_QUOTES`](sql-mode.md#sqlmode_ansi_quotes) mode causes the
server to interpret double-quoted strings as identifiers.
Consequently, when this mode is enabled, string literals must be
enclosed within single quotation marks. They cannot be enclosed
within double quotation marks. The server SQL mode is controlled
as described in [Section 7.1.11, “Server SQL Modes”](sql-mode.md "7.1.11 Server SQL Modes").

Identifier quote characters can be included within an identifier
if you quote the identifier. If the character to be included
within the identifier is the same as that used to quote the
identifier itself, then you need to double the character. The
following statement creates a table named `` a`b ``
that contains a column named `c"d`:

```sql
mysql> CREATE TABLE `a``b` (`c"d` INT);
```

In the select list of a query, a quoted column alias can be
specified using identifier or string quoting characters:

```sql
mysql> SELECT 1 AS `one`, 2 AS 'two';
+-----+-----+
| one | two |
+-----+-----+
|   1 |   2 |
+-----+-----+
```

Elsewhere in the statement, quoted references to the alias must
use identifier quoting or the reference is treated as a string
literal.

It is recommended that you do not use names that begin with
`Me` or
`MeN`,
where *`M`* and
*`N`* are integers. For example, avoid
using `1e` as an identifier, because an
expression such as `1e+3` is ambiguous. Depending
on context, it might be interpreted as the expression `1e
+ 3` or as the number `1e+3`.

Be careful when using [`MD5()`](encryption-functions.md#function_md5) to
produce table names because it can produce names in illegal or
ambiguous formats such as those just described.

It is also recommended that you do not use column names that begin
with `!hidden!` to ensure that new names do not
collide with names used by existing hidden columns for functional
indexes.

A user variable cannot be used directly in an SQL statement as an
identifier or as part of an identifier. See
[Section 11.4, “User-Defined Variables”](user-variables.md "11.4 User-Defined Variables"), for more information and
examples of workarounds.

Special characters in database and table names are encoded in the
corresponding file system names as described in
[Section 11.2.4, “Mapping of Identifiers to File Names”](identifier-mapping.md "11.2.4 Mapping of Identifiers to File Names").
