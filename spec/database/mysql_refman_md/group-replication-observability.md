#### 20.1.4.4 Observability

There is a lot of automation built into the Group Replication
plugin. Nonetheless, you might sometimes need to understand what
is happening behind the scenes. This is where the
instrumentation of Group Replication and Performance Schema
becomes important. The entire state of the system (including the
view, conflict statistics and service states) can be queried
through Performance Schema tables. The distributed nature of the
replication protocol and the fact that server instances agree
and thus synchronize on transactions and metadata makes it
simpler to inspect the state of the group. For example, you can
connect to a single server in the group and obtain both local
and global information by issuing select statements on the Group
Replication related Performance Schema tables. For more
information, see [Section 20.4, “Monitoring Group Replication”](group-replication-monitoring.md "20.4 Monitoring Group Replication").
