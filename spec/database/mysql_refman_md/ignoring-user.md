#### B.3.2.13 Ignoring user

If you get the following error, it means that when
[**mysqld**](mysqld.md "6.3.1 mysqld — The MySQL Server") was started or when it reloaded the
grant tables, it found an account in the
`user` table that had an invalid password.

`Found wrong password for user
'some_user'@'some_host';
ignoring user`

As a result, the account is simply ignored by the permission
system. To fix this problem, assign a new, valid password to
the account.
