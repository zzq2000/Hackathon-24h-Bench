- [`ANY_VALUE(arg)`](miscellaneous-functions.md#function_any-value)

  This function is useful for `GROUP BY`
  queries when the
  [`ONLY_FULL_GROUP_BY`](sql-mode.md#sqlmode_only_full_group_by) SQL mode
  is enabled, for cases when MySQL rejects a query that you know
  is valid for reasons that MySQL cannot determine. The function
  return value and type are the same as the return value and
  type of its argument, but the function result is not checked
  for the [`ONLY_FULL_GROUP_BY`](sql-mode.md#sqlmode_only_full_group_by)
  SQL mode.

  For example, if `name` is a nonindexed
  column, the following query fails with
  [`ONLY_FULL_GROUP_BY`](sql-mode.md#sqlmode_only_full_group_by) enabled:

  ```sql
  mysql> SELECT name, address, MAX(age) FROM t GROUP BY name;
  ERROR 1055 (42000): Expression #2 of SELECT list is not in GROUP
  BY clause and contains nonaggregated column 'mydb.t.address' which
  is not functionally dependent on columns in GROUP BY clause; this
  is incompatible with sql_mode=only_full_group_by
  ```

  The failure occurs because `address` is a
  nonaggregated column that is neither named among
  `GROUP BY` columns nor functionally dependent
  on them. As a result, the `address` value for
  rows within each `name` group is
  nondeterministic. There are multiple ways to cause MySQL to
  accept the query:

  - Alter the table to make `name` a primary
    key or a unique `NOT NULL` column. This
    enables MySQL to determine that `address`
    is functionally dependent on `name`; that
    is, `address` is uniquely determined by
    `name`. (This technique is inapplicable
    if `NULL` must be permitted as a valid
    `name` value.)
  - Use [`ANY_VALUE()`](miscellaneous-functions.md#function_any-value) to refer to
    `address`:

    ```sql
    SELECT name, ANY_VALUE(address), MAX(age) FROM t GROUP BY name;
    ```

    In this case, MySQL ignores the nondeterminism of
    `address` values within each
    `name` group and accepts the query. This
    may be useful if you simply do not care which value of a
    nonaggregated column is chosen for each group.
    [`ANY_VALUE()`](miscellaneous-functions.md#function_any-value) is not an
    aggregate function, unlike functions such as
    [`SUM()`](aggregate-functions.md#function_sum) or
    [`COUNT()`](aggregate-functions.md#function_count). It simply acts to
    suppress the test for nondeterminism.
  - Disable
    [`ONLY_FULL_GROUP_BY`](sql-mode.md#sqlmode_only_full_group_by). This
    is equivalent to using
    [`ANY_VALUE()`](miscellaneous-functions.md#function_any-value) with
    [`ONLY_FULL_GROUP_BY`](sql-mode.md#sqlmode_only_full_group_by)
    enabled, as described in the previous item.

  [`ANY_VALUE()`](miscellaneous-functions.md#function_any-value) is also useful if
  functional dependence exists between columns but MySQL cannot
  determine it. The following query is valid because
  `age` is functionally dependent on the
  grouping column `age-1`, but MySQL cannot
  tell that and rejects the query with
  [`ONLY_FULL_GROUP_BY`](sql-mode.md#sqlmode_only_full_group_by) enabled:

  ```sql
  SELECT age FROM t GROUP BY age-1;
  ```

  To cause MySQL to accept the query, use
  [`ANY_VALUE()`](miscellaneous-functions.md#function_any-value):

  ```sql
  SELECT ANY_VALUE(age) FROM t GROUP BY age-1;
  ```

  [`ANY_VALUE()`](miscellaneous-functions.md#function_any-value) can be used for
  queries that refer to aggregate functions in the absence of a
  `GROUP BY` clause:

  ```sql
  mysql> SELECT name, MAX(age) FROM t;
  ERROR 1140 (42000): In aggregated query without GROUP BY, expression
  #1 of SELECT list contains nonaggregated column 'mydb.t.name'; this
  is incompatible with sql_mode=only_full_group_by
  ```

  Without `GROUP BY`, there is a single group
  and it is nondeterministic which `name` value
  to choose for the group.
  [`ANY_VALUE()`](miscellaneous-functions.md#function_any-value) tells MySQL to
  accept the query:

  ```sql
  SELECT ANY_VALUE(name), MAX(age) FROM t;
  ```

  It may be that, due to some property of a given data set, you
  know that a selected nonaggregated column is effectively
  functionally dependent on a `GROUP BY`
  column. For example, an application may enforce uniqueness of
  one column with respect to another. In this case, using
  [`ANY_VALUE()`](miscellaneous-functions.md#function_any-value) for the effectively
  functionally dependent column may make sense.

  For additional discussion, see
  [Section 14.19.3, “MySQL Handling of GROUP BY”](group-by-handling.md "14.19.3 MySQL Handling of GROUP BY").
- [`BIN_TO_UUID(binary_uuid)`](miscellaneous-functions.md#function_bin-to-uuid),
  [`BIN_TO_UUID(binary_uuid,
  swap_flag)`](miscellaneous-functions.md#function_bin-to-uuid)

  [`BIN_TO_UUID()`](miscellaneous-functions.md#function_bin-to-uuid) is the inverse of
  [`UUID_TO_BIN()`](miscellaneous-functions.md#function_uuid-to-bin). It converts a
  binary UUID to a string UUID and returns the result. The
  binary value should be a UUID as a
  [`VARBINARY(16)`](binary-varbinary.md "13.3.3 The BINARY and VARBINARY Types") value. The return
  value is a string of five hexadecimal numbers separated by
  dashes. (For details about this format, see the
  [`UUID()`](miscellaneous-functions.md#function_uuid) function description.)
  If the UUID argument is `NULL`, the return
  value is `NULL`. If any argument is invalid,
  an error occurs.

  [`BIN_TO_UUID()`](miscellaneous-functions.md#function_bin-to-uuid) takes one or two
  arguments:

  - The one-argument form takes a binary UUID value. The UUID
    value is assumed not to have its time-low and time-high
    parts swapped. The string result is in the same order as
    the binary argument.
  - The two-argument form takes a binary UUID value and a
    swap-flag value:

    - If *`swap_flag`* is 0, the
      two-argument form is equivalent to the one-argument
      form. The string result is in the same order as the
      binary argument.
    - If *`swap_flag`* is 1, the UUID
      value is assumed to have its time-low and time-high
      parts swapped. These parts are swapped back to their
      original position in the result value.

  For usage examples and information about time-part swapping,
  see the [`UUID_TO_BIN()`](miscellaneous-functions.md#function_uuid-to-bin) function
  description.
- [`DEFAULT(col_name)`](miscellaneous-functions.md#function_default)

  Returns the default value for a table column. An error results
  if the column has no default value.

  The use of
  [`DEFAULT(col_name)`](miscellaneous-functions.md#function_default)
  to specify the default value for a named column is permitted
  only for columns that have a literal default value, not for
  columns that have an expression default value.

  ```sql
  mysql> UPDATE t SET i = DEFAULT(i)+1 WHERE id < 100;
  ```
- [`FORMAT(X,D)`](string-functions.md#function_format)

  Formats the number *`X`* to a format
  like `'#,###,###.##'`, rounded to
  *`D`* decimal places, and returns the
  result as a string. For details, see
  [Section 14.8, “String Functions and Operators”](string-functions.md "14.8 String Functions and Operators").
- [`GROUPING(expr
  [, expr] ...)`](miscellaneous-functions.md#function_grouping)

  For `GROUP BY` queries that include a
  `WITH ROLLUP` modifier, the
  `ROLLUP` operation produces super-aggregate
  output rows where `NULL` represents the set
  of all values. The [`GROUPING()`](miscellaneous-functions.md#function_grouping)
  function enables you to distinguish `NULL`
  values for super-aggregate rows from `NULL`
  values in regular grouped rows.

  [`GROUPING()`](miscellaneous-functions.md#function_grouping) is permitted in the
  select list, `HAVING` clause, and (as of
  MySQL 8.0.12) `ORDER BY` clause.

  Each argument to [`GROUPING()`](miscellaneous-functions.md#function_grouping)
  must be an expression that exactly matches an expression in
  the `GROUP BY` clause. The expression cannot
  be a positional specifier. For each expression,
  [`GROUPING()`](miscellaneous-functions.md#function_grouping) produces 1 if the
  expression value in the current row is a
  `NULL` representing a super-aggregate value.
  Otherwise, [`GROUPING()`](miscellaneous-functions.md#function_grouping) produces
  0, indicating that the expression value is a
  `NULL` for a regular result row or is not
  `NULL`.

  Suppose that table `t1` contains these rows,
  where `NULL` indicates something like
  “other” or “unknown”:

  ```sql
  mysql> SELECT * FROM t1;
  +------+-------+----------+
  | name | size  | quantity |
  +------+-------+----------+
  | ball | small |       10 |
  | ball | large |       20 |
  | ball | NULL  |        5 |
  | hoop | small |       15 |
  | hoop | large |        5 |
  | hoop | NULL  |        3 |
  +------+-------+----------+
  ```

  A summary of the table without `WITH ROLLUP`
  looks like this:

  ```sql
  mysql> SELECT name, size, SUM(quantity) AS quantity
         FROM t1
         GROUP BY name, size;
  +------+-------+----------+
  | name | size  | quantity |
  +------+-------+----------+
  | ball | small |       10 |
  | ball | large |       20 |
  | ball | NULL  |        5 |
  | hoop | small |       15 |
  | hoop | large |        5 |
  | hoop | NULL  |        3 |
  +------+-------+----------+
  ```

  The result contains `NULL` values, but those
  do not represent super-aggregate rows because the query does
  not include `WITH ROLLUP`.

  Adding `WITH ROLLUP` produces super-aggregate
  summary rows containing additional `NULL`
  values. However, without comparing this result to the previous
  one, it is not easy to see which `NULL`
  values occur in super-aggregate rows and which occur in
  regular grouped rows:

  ```sql
  mysql> SELECT name, size, SUM(quantity) AS quantity
         FROM t1
         GROUP BY name, size WITH ROLLUP;
  +------+-------+----------+
  | name | size  | quantity |
  +------+-------+----------+
  | ball | NULL  |        5 |
  | ball | large |       20 |
  | ball | small |       10 |
  | ball | NULL  |       35 |
  | hoop | NULL  |        3 |
  | hoop | large |        5 |
  | hoop | small |       15 |
  | hoop | NULL  |       23 |
  | NULL | NULL  |       58 |
  +------+-------+----------+
  ```

  To distinguish `NULL` values in
  super-aggregate rows from those in regular grouped rows, use
  [`GROUPING()`](miscellaneous-functions.md#function_grouping), which returns 1
  only for super-aggregate `NULL` values:

  ```sql
  mysql> SELECT
           name, size, SUM(quantity) AS quantity,
           GROUPING(name) AS grp_name,
           GROUPING(size) AS grp_size
         FROM t1
         GROUP BY name, size WITH ROLLUP;
  +------+-------+----------+----------+----------+
  | name | size  | quantity | grp_name | grp_size |
  +------+-------+----------+----------+----------+
  | ball | NULL  |        5 |        0 |        0 |
  | ball | large |       20 |        0 |        0 |
  | ball | small |       10 |        0 |        0 |
  | ball | NULL  |       35 |        0 |        1 |
  | hoop | NULL  |        3 |        0 |        0 |
  | hoop | large |        5 |        0 |        0 |
  | hoop | small |       15 |        0 |        0 |
  | hoop | NULL  |       23 |        0 |        1 |
  | NULL | NULL  |       58 |        1 |        1 |
  +------+-------+----------+----------+----------+
  ```

  Common uses for [`GROUPING()`](miscellaneous-functions.md#function_grouping):

  - Substitute a label for super-aggregate
    `NULL` values:

    ```sql
    mysql> SELECT
             IF(GROUPING(name) = 1, 'All items', name) AS name,
             IF(GROUPING(size) = 1, 'All sizes', size) AS size,
             SUM(quantity) AS quantity
           FROM t1
           GROUP BY name, size WITH ROLLUP;
    +-----------+-----------+----------+
    | name      | size      | quantity |
    +-----------+-----------+----------+
    | ball      | NULL      |        5 |
    | ball      | large     |       20 |
    | ball      | small     |       10 |
    | ball      | All sizes |       35 |
    | hoop      | NULL      |        3 |
    | hoop      | large     |        5 |
    | hoop      | small     |       15 |
    | hoop      | All sizes |       23 |
    | All items | All sizes |       58 |
    +-----------+-----------+----------+
    ```
  - Return only super-aggregate lines by filtering out the
    regular grouped lines:

    ```sql
    mysql> SELECT name, size, SUM(quantity) AS quantity
           FROM t1
           GROUP BY name, size WITH ROLLUP
           HAVING GROUPING(name) = 1 OR GROUPING(size) = 1;
    +------+------+----------+
    | name | size | quantity |
    +------+------+----------+
    | ball | NULL |       35 |
    | hoop | NULL |       23 |
    | NULL | NULL |       58 |
    +------+------+----------+
    ```

  [`GROUPING()`](miscellaneous-functions.md#function_grouping) permits multiple
  expression arguments. In this case, the
  [`GROUPING()`](miscellaneous-functions.md#function_grouping) return value
  represents a bitmask combined from the results for each
  expression, where the lowest-order bit corresponds to the
  result for the rightmost expression. For example, with three
  expression arguments,
  [`GROUPING(expr1,
  expr2,
  expr3)`](miscellaneous-functions.md#function_grouping) is evaluated like
  this:

  ```clike
    result for GROUPING(expr3)
  + result for GROUPING(expr2) << 1
  + result for GROUPING(expr1) << 2
  ```

  The following query shows how
  [`GROUPING()`](miscellaneous-functions.md#function_grouping) results for single
  arguments combine for a multiple-argument call to produce a
  bitmask value:

  ```sql
  mysql> SELECT
           name, size, SUM(quantity) AS quantity,
           GROUPING(name) AS grp_name,
           GROUPING(size) AS grp_size,
         GROUPING(name, size) AS grp_all
         FROM t1
         GROUP BY name, size WITH ROLLUP;
  +------+-------+----------+----------+----------+---------+
  | name | size  | quantity | grp_name | grp_size | grp_all |
  +------+-------+----------+----------+----------+---------+
  | ball | NULL  |        5 |        0 |        0 |       0 |
  | ball | large |       20 |        0 |        0 |       0 |
  | ball | small |       10 |        0 |        0 |       0 |
  | ball | NULL  |       35 |        0 |        1 |       1 |
  | hoop | NULL  |        3 |        0 |        0 |       0 |
  | hoop | large |        5 |        0 |        0 |       0 |
  | hoop | small |       15 |        0 |        0 |       0 |
  | hoop | NULL  |       23 |        0 |        1 |       1 |
  | NULL | NULL  |       58 |        1 |        1 |       3 |
  +------+-------+----------+----------+----------+---------+
  ```

  With multiple expression arguments, the
  [`GROUPING()`](miscellaneous-functions.md#function_grouping) return value is
  nonzero if any expression represents a super-aggregate value.
  Multiple-argument [`GROUPING()`](miscellaneous-functions.md#function_grouping)
  syntax thus provides a simpler way to write the earlier query
  that returned only super-aggregate rows, by using a single
  multiple-argument [`GROUPING()`](miscellaneous-functions.md#function_grouping)
  call rather than multiple single-argument calls:

  ```sql
  mysql> SELECT name, size, SUM(quantity) AS quantity
         FROM t1
         GROUP BY name, size WITH ROLLUP
         HAVING GROUPING(name, size) <> 0;
  +------+------+----------+
  | name | size | quantity |
  +------+------+----------+
  | ball | NULL |       35 |
  | hoop | NULL |       23 |
  | NULL | NULL |       58 |
  +------+------+----------+
  ```

  Use of [`GROUPING()`](miscellaneous-functions.md#function_grouping) is subject to
  these limitations:

  - Do not use subquery `GROUP BY`
    expressions as [`GROUPING()`](miscellaneous-functions.md#function_grouping)
    arguments because matching might fail. For example,
    matching fails for this query:

    ```sql
    mysql> SELECT GROUPING((SELECT MAX(name) FROM t1))
           FROM t1
           GROUP BY (SELECT MAX(name) FROM t1) WITH ROLLUP;
    ERROR 3580 (HY000): Argument #1 of GROUPING function is not in GROUP BY
    ```
  - `GROUP BY` literal expressions should not
    be used within a `HAVING` clause as
    [`GROUPING()`](miscellaneous-functions.md#function_grouping) arguments. Due
    to differences between when the optimizer evaluates
    `GROUP BY` and `HAVING`,
    matching may succeed but
    [`GROUPING()`](miscellaneous-functions.md#function_grouping) evaluation does
    not produce the expected result. Consider this query:

    ```sql
    SELECT a AS f1, 'w' AS f2
    FROM t
    GROUP BY f1, f2 WITH ROLLUP
    HAVING GROUPING(f2) = 1;
    ```

    [`GROUPING()`](miscellaneous-functions.md#function_grouping) is evaluated
    earlier for the literal constant expression than for the
    `HAVING` clause as a whole and returns 0.
    To check whether a query such as this is affected, use
    [`EXPLAIN`](explain.md "15.8.2 EXPLAIN Statement") and look for
    `Impossible having` in the
    `Extra` column.

  For more information about `WITH ROLLUP` and
  [`GROUPING()`](miscellaneous-functions.md#function_grouping), see
  [Section 14.19.2, “GROUP BY Modifiers”](group-by-modifiers.md "14.19.2 GROUP BY Modifiers").
- [`INET_ATON(expr)`](miscellaneous-functions.md#function_inet-aton)

  Given the dotted-quad representation of an IPv4 network
  address as a string, returns an integer that represents the
  numeric value of the address in network byte order (big
  endian). [`INET_ATON()`](miscellaneous-functions.md#function_inet-aton) returns
  `NULL` if it does not understand its
  argument, or if *`expr`* is
  `NULL`.

  ```sql
  mysql> SELECT INET_ATON('10.0.5.9');
          -> 167773449
  ```

  For this example, the return value is calculated as
  10×2563 +
  0×2562 + 5×256 + 9.

  [`INET_ATON()`](miscellaneous-functions.md#function_inet-aton) may or may not
  return a non-`NULL` result for short-form IP
  addresses (such as `'127.1'` as a
  representation of `'127.0.0.1'`). Because of
  this, [`INET_ATON()`](miscellaneous-functions.md#function_inet-aton)a should not
  be used for such addresses.

  Note

  To store values generated by
  [`INET_ATON()`](miscellaneous-functions.md#function_inet-aton), use an
  `INT UNSIGNED` column rather than
  [`INT`](integer-types.md "13.1.2 Integer Types (Exact Value) - INTEGER, INT, SMALLINT, TINYINT, MEDIUMINT, BIGINT"), which is signed. If you
  use a signed column, values corresponding to IP addresses
  for which the first octet is greater than 127 cannot be
  stored correctly. See
  [Section 13.1.7, “Out-of-Range and Overflow Handling”](out-of-range-and-overflow.md "13.1.7 Out-of-Range and Overflow Handling").
- [`INET_NTOA(expr)`](miscellaneous-functions.md#function_inet-ntoa)

  Given a numeric IPv4 network address in network byte order,
  returns the dotted-quad string representation of the address
  as a string in the connection character set.
  [`INET_NTOA()`](miscellaneous-functions.md#function_inet-ntoa) returns
  `NULL` if it does not understand its
  argument.

  ```sql
  mysql> SELECT INET_NTOA(167773449);
          -> '10.0.5.9'
  ```
- [`INET6_ATON(expr)`](miscellaneous-functions.md#function_inet6-aton)

  Given an IPv6 or IPv4 network address as a string, returns a
  binary string that represents the numeric value of the address
  in network byte order (big endian). Because numeric-format
  IPv6 addresses require more bytes than the largest integer
  type, the representation returned by this function has the
  [`VARBINARY`](binary-varbinary.md "13.3.3 The BINARY and VARBINARY Types") data type:
  [`VARBINARY(16)`](binary-varbinary.md "13.3.3 The BINARY and VARBINARY Types") for IPv6
  addresses and [`VARBINARY(4)`](binary-varbinary.md "13.3.3 The BINARY and VARBINARY Types") for
  IPv4 addresses. If the argument is not a valid address, or if
  it is `NULL`,
  [`INET6_ATON()`](miscellaneous-functions.md#function_inet6-aton) returns
  `NULL`.

  The following examples use
  [`HEX()`](string-functions.md#function_hex) to display the
  [`INET6_ATON()`](miscellaneous-functions.md#function_inet6-aton) result in
  printable form:

  ```sql
  mysql> SELECT HEX(INET6_ATON('fdfe::5a55:caff:fefa:9089'));
          -> 'FDFE0000000000005A55CAFFFEFA9089'
  mysql> SELECT HEX(INET6_ATON('10.0.5.9'));
          -> '0A000509'
  ```

  `INET6_ATON()` observes several constraints
  on valid arguments. These are given in the following list
  along with examples.

  - A trailing zone ID is not permitted, as in
    `fe80::3%1` or
    `fe80::3%eth0`.
  - A trailing network mask is not permitted, as in
    `2001:45f:3:ba::/64` or
    `198.51.100.0/24`.
  - For values representing IPv4 addresses, only classless
    addresses are supported. Classful addresses such as
    `198.51.1` are rejected. A trailing port
    number is not permitted, as in
    `198.51.100.2:8080`. Hexadecimal numbers
    in address components are not permitted, as in
    `198.0xa0.1.2`. Octal numbers are not
    supported: `198.51.010.1` is treated as
    `198.51.10.1`, not
    `198.51.8.1`. These IPv4 constraints also
    apply to IPv6 addresses that have IPv4 address parts, such
    as IPv4-compatible or IPv4-mapped addresses.

  To convert an IPv4 address *`expr`*
  represented in numeric form as an
  [`INT`](integer-types.md "13.1.2 Integer Types (Exact Value) - INTEGER, INT, SMALLINT, TINYINT, MEDIUMINT, BIGINT") value to an IPv6 address
  represented in numeric form as a
  [`VARBINARY`](binary-varbinary.md "13.3.3 The BINARY and VARBINARY Types") value, use this
  expression:

  ```sql
  INET6_ATON(INET_NTOA(expr))
  ```

  For example:

  ```sql
  mysql> SELECT HEX(INET6_ATON(INET_NTOA(167773449)));
          -> '0A000509'
  ```

  If [`INET6_ATON()`](miscellaneous-functions.md#function_inet6-aton) is invoked from
  within the [**mysql**](mysql.md "6.5.1 mysql — The MySQL Command-Line Client") client, binary strings
  display using hexadecimal notation, depending on the value of
  the [`--binary-as-hex`](mysql-command-options.md#option_mysql_binary-as-hex). For more
  information about that option, see [Section 6.5.1, “mysql — The MySQL Command-Line Client”](mysql.md "6.5.1 mysql — The MySQL Command-Line Client").
- [`INET6_NTOA(expr)`](miscellaneous-functions.md#function_inet6-ntoa)

  Given an IPv6 or IPv4 network address represented in numeric
  form as a binary string, returns the string representation of
  the address as a string in the connection character set. If
  the argument is not a valid address, or if it is
  `NULL`,
  [`INET6_NTOA()`](miscellaneous-functions.md#function_inet6-ntoa) returns
  `NULL`.

  [`INET6_NTOA()`](miscellaneous-functions.md#function_inet6-ntoa) has these
  properties:

  - It does not use operating system functions to perform
    conversions, thus the output string is platform
    independent.
  - The return string has a maximum length of 39 (4 x 8 + 7).
    Given this statement:

    ```sql
    CREATE TABLE t AS SELECT INET6_NTOA(expr) AS c1;
    ```

    The resulting table would have this definition:

    ```sql
    CREATE TABLE t (c1 VARCHAR(39) CHARACTER SET utf8mb3 DEFAULT NULL);
    ```
  - The return string uses lowercase letters for IPv6
    addresses.

  ```sql
  mysql> SELECT INET6_NTOA(INET6_ATON('fdfe::5a55:caff:fefa:9089'));
          -> 'fdfe::5a55:caff:fefa:9089'
  mysql> SELECT INET6_NTOA(INET6_ATON('10.0.5.9'));
          -> '10.0.5.9'

  mysql> SELECT INET6_NTOA(UNHEX('FDFE0000000000005A55CAFFFEFA9089'));
          -> 'fdfe::5a55:caff:fefa:9089'
  mysql> SELECT INET6_NTOA(UNHEX('0A000509'));
          -> '10.0.5.9'
  ```

  If [`INET6_NTOA()`](miscellaneous-functions.md#function_inet6-ntoa) is invoked from
  within the [**mysql**](mysql.md "6.5.1 mysql — The MySQL Command-Line Client") client, binary strings
  display using hexadecimal notation, depending on the value of
  the [`--binary-as-hex`](mysql-command-options.md#option_mysql_binary-as-hex). For more
  information about that option, see [Section 6.5.1, “mysql — The MySQL Command-Line Client”](mysql.md "6.5.1 mysql — The MySQL Command-Line Client").
- [`IS_IPV4(expr)`](miscellaneous-functions.md#function_is-ipv4)

  Returns 1 if the argument is a valid IPv4 address specified as
  a string, 0 otherwise. Returns `NULL` if
  *`expr`* is `NULL`.

  ```sql
  mysql> SELECT IS_IPV4('10.0.5.9'), IS_IPV4('10.0.5.256');
          -> 1, 0
  ```

  For a given argument, if
  [`IS_IPV4()`](miscellaneous-functions.md#function_is-ipv4) returns 1,
  [`INET_ATON()`](miscellaneous-functions.md#function_inet-aton) (and
  [`INET6_ATON()`](miscellaneous-functions.md#function_inet6-aton)) returns
  non-`NULL`. The converse statement is not
  true: In some cases,
  [`INET_ATON()`](miscellaneous-functions.md#function_inet-aton) returns
  non-`NULL` when
  [`IS_IPV4()`](miscellaneous-functions.md#function_is-ipv4) returns 0.

  As implied by the preceding remarks,
  [`IS_IPV4()`](miscellaneous-functions.md#function_is-ipv4) is more strict than
  [`INET_ATON()`](miscellaneous-functions.md#function_inet-aton) about what
  constitutes a valid IPv4 address, so it may be useful for
  applications that need to perform strong checks against
  invalid values. Alternatively, use
  [`INET6_ATON()`](miscellaneous-functions.md#function_inet6-aton) to convert IPv4
  addresses to internal form and check for a
  `NULL` result (which indicates an invalid
  address). [`INET6_ATON()`](miscellaneous-functions.md#function_inet6-aton) is
  equally strong as [`IS_IPV4()`](miscellaneous-functions.md#function_is-ipv4)
  about checking IPv4 addresses.
- [`IS_IPV4_COMPAT(expr)`](miscellaneous-functions.md#function_is-ipv4-compat)

  This function takes an IPv6 address represented in numeric
  form as a binary string, as returned by
  [`INET6_ATON()`](miscellaneous-functions.md#function_inet6-aton). It returns 1 if
  the argument is a valid IPv4-compatible IPv6 address, 0
  otherwise (unless *`expr`* is
  `NULL`, in which case the function returns
  `NULL`). IPv4-compatible addresses have the
  form
  `::ipv4_address`.

  ```sql
  mysql> SELECT IS_IPV4_COMPAT(INET6_ATON('::10.0.5.9'));
          -> 1
  mysql> SELECT IS_IPV4_COMPAT(INET6_ATON('::ffff:10.0.5.9'));
          -> 0
  ```

  The IPv4 part of an IPv4-compatible address can also be
  represented using hexadecimal notation. For example,
  `198.51.100.1` has this raw hexadecimal
  value:

  ```sql
  mysql> SELECT HEX(INET6_ATON('198.51.100.1'));
          -> 'C6336401'
  ```

  Expressed in IPv4-compatible form,
  `::198.51.100.1` is equivalent to
  `::c0a8:0001` or (without leading zeros)
  `::c0a8:1`

  ```sql
  mysql> SELECT
      ->   IS_IPV4_COMPAT(INET6_ATON('::198.51.100.1')),
      ->   IS_IPV4_COMPAT(INET6_ATON('::c0a8:0001')),
      ->   IS_IPV4_COMPAT(INET6_ATON('::c0a8:1'));
          -> 1, 1, 1
  ```
- [`IS_IPV4_MAPPED(expr)`](miscellaneous-functions.md#function_is-ipv4-mapped)

  This function takes an IPv6 address represented in numeric
  form as a binary string, as returned by
  [`INET6_ATON()`](miscellaneous-functions.md#function_inet6-aton). It returns 1 if
  the argument is a valid IPv4-mapped IPv6 address, 0 otherwise,
  unless *`expr`* is
  `NULL`, in which case the function returns
  `NULL`. IPv4-mapped addresses have the form
  `::ffff:ipv4_address`.

  ```sql
  mysql> SELECT IS_IPV4_MAPPED(INET6_ATON('::10.0.5.9'));
          -> 0
  mysql> SELECT IS_IPV4_MAPPED(INET6_ATON('::ffff:10.0.5.9'));
          -> 1
  ```

  As with `IS_IPV4_COMPAT()` the IPv4 part of
  an IPv4-mapped address can also be represented using
  hexadecimal notation:

  ```sql
  mysql> SELECT
      ->   IS_IPV4_MAPPED(INET6_ATON('::ffff:198.51.100.1')),
      ->   IS_IPV4_MAPPED(INET6_ATON('::ffff:c0a8:0001')),
      ->   IS_IPV4_MAPPED(INET6_ATON('::ffff:c0a8:1'));
          -> 1, 1, 1
  ```
- [`IS_IPV6(expr)`](miscellaneous-functions.md#function_is-ipv6)

  Returns 1 if the argument is a valid IPv6 address specified as
  a string, 0 otherwise, unless *`expr`*
  is `NULL`, in which case the function returns
  `NULL`. This function does not consider IPv4
  addresses to be valid IPv6 addresses.

  ```sql
  mysql> SELECT IS_IPV6('10.0.5.9'), IS_IPV6('::1');
          -> 0, 1
  ```

  For a given argument, if
  [`IS_IPV6()`](miscellaneous-functions.md#function_is-ipv6) returns 1,
  [`INET6_ATON()`](miscellaneous-functions.md#function_inet6-aton) returns
  non-`NULL`.
- [`IS_UUID(string_uuid)`](miscellaneous-functions.md#function_is-uuid)

  Returns 1 if the argument is a valid string-format UUID, 0 if
  the argument is not a valid UUID, and `NULL`
  if the argument is `NULL`.

  “Valid” means that the value is in a format that
  can be parsed. That is, it has the correct length and contains
  only the permitted characters (hexadecimal digits in any
  lettercase and, optionally, dashes and curly braces). This
  format is most common:

  ```none
  aaaaaaaa-bbbb-cccc-dddd-eeeeeeeeeeee
  ```

  These other formats are also permitted:

  ```none
  aaaaaaaabbbbccccddddeeeeeeeeeeee
  {aaaaaaaa-bbbb-cccc-dddd-eeeeeeeeeeee}
  ```

  For the meanings of fields within the value, see the
  [`UUID()`](miscellaneous-functions.md#function_uuid) function description.

  ```sql
  mysql> SELECT IS_UUID('6ccd780c-baba-1026-9564-5b8c656024db');
  +-------------------------------------------------+
  | IS_UUID('6ccd780c-baba-1026-9564-5b8c656024db') |

  +---------------------------------------------+
  mysql> SELECT IS_UUID(RAND());
  +-----------------+
  | IS_UUID(RAND()) |
  +-----------------+
  |               0 |
  +-----------------+
  ```
- [`NAME_CONST(name,value)`](miscellaneous-functions.md#function_name-const)

  Returns the given value. When used to produce a result set
  column, [`NAME_CONST()`](miscellaneous-functions.md#function_name-const) causes the
  column to have the given name. The arguments should be
  constants.

  ```sql
  mysql> SELECT NAME_CONST('myname', 14);
  +--------+
  | myname |
  +--------+
  |     14 |
  +--------+
  ```

  This function is for internal use only. The server uses it
  when writing statements from stored programs that contain
  references to local program variables, as described in
  [Section 27.7, “Stored Program Binary Logging”](stored-programs-logging.md "27.7 Stored Program Binary Logging"). You might see this
  function in the output from [**mysqlbinlog**](mysqlbinlog.md "6.6.9 mysqlbinlog — Utility for Processing Binary Log Files").

  For your applications, you can obtain exactly the same result
  as in the example just shown by using simple aliasing, like
  this:

  ```sql
  mysql> SELECT 14 AS myname;
  +--------+
  | myname |
  +--------+
  |     14 |
  +--------+
  1 row in set (0.00 sec)
  ```

  See [Section 15.2.13, “SELECT Statement”](select.md "15.2.13 SELECT Statement"), for more information about
  column aliases.
- [`SLEEP(duration)`](miscellaneous-functions.md#function_sleep)

  Sleeps (pauses) for the number of seconds given by the
  *`duration`* argument, then returns 0.
  The duration may have a fractional part. If the argument is
  `NULL` or negative,
  [`SLEEP()`](miscellaneous-functions.md#function_sleep) produces a warning, or
  an error in strict SQL mode.

  When sleep returns normally (without interruption), it returns
  0:

  ```sql
  mysql> SELECT SLEEP(1000);
  +-------------+
  | SLEEP(1000) |
  +-------------+
  |           0 |
  +-------------+
  ```

  When [`SLEEP()`](miscellaneous-functions.md#function_sleep) is the only thing
  invoked by a query that is interrupted, it returns 1 and the
  query itself returns no error. This is true whether the query
  is killed or times out:

  - This statement is interrupted using
    [`KILL QUERY`](kill.md "15.7.8.4 KILL Statement")
    from another session:

    ```sql
    mysql> SELECT SLEEP(1000);
    +-------------+
    | SLEEP(1000) |
    +-------------+
    |           1 |
    +-------------+
    ```
  - This statement is interrupted by timing out:

    ```sql
    mysql> SELECT /*+ MAX_EXECUTION_TIME(1) */ SLEEP(1000);
    +-------------+
    | SLEEP(1000) |
    +-------------+
    |           1 |
    +-------------+
    ```

  When [`SLEEP()`](miscellaneous-functions.md#function_sleep) is only part of a
  query that is interrupted, the query returns an error:

  - This statement is interrupted using
    [`KILL QUERY`](kill.md "15.7.8.4 KILL Statement")
    from another session:

    ```sql
    mysql> SELECT 1 FROM t1 WHERE SLEEP(1000);
    ERROR 1317 (70100): Query execution was interrupted
    ```
  - This statement is interrupted by timing out:

    ```sql
    mysql> SELECT /*+ MAX_EXECUTION_TIME(1000) */ 1 FROM t1 WHERE SLEEP(1000);
    ERROR 3024 (HY000): Query execution was interrupted, maximum statement
    execution time exceeded
    ```

  This function is unsafe for statement-based replication. A
  warning is logged if you use this function when
  [`binlog_format`](replication-options-binary-log.md#sysvar_binlog_format) is set to
  `STATEMENT`.
- [`UUID()`](miscellaneous-functions.md#function_uuid)

  Returns a Universal Unique Identifier (UUID) generated
  according to RFC 4122, “A Universally Unique IDentifier
  (UUID) URN Namespace”
  (<http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc4122.txt>).

  A UUID is designed as a number that is globally unique in
  space and time. Two calls to
  [`UUID()`](miscellaneous-functions.md#function_uuid) are expected to generate
  two different values, even if these calls are performed on two
  separate devices not connected to each other.

  Warning

  Although [`UUID()`](miscellaneous-functions.md#function_uuid) values are
  intended to be unique, they are not necessarily unguessable
  or unpredictable. If unpredictability is required, UUID
  values should be generated some other way.

  [`UUID()`](miscellaneous-functions.md#function_uuid) returns a value that
  conforms to UUID version 1 as described in RFC 4122. The value
  is a 128-bit number represented as a
  `utf8mb3` string of five hexadecimal numbers
  in `aaaaaaaa-bbbb-cccc-dddd-eeeeeeeeeeee`
  format:

  - The first three numbers are generated from the low,
    middle, and high parts of a timestamp. The high part also
    includes the UUID version number.
  - The fourth number preserves temporal uniqueness in case
    the timestamp value loses monotonicity (for example, due
    to daylight saving time).
  - The fifth number is an IEEE 802 node number that provides
    spatial uniqueness. A random number is substituted if the
    latter is not available (for example, because the host
    device has no Ethernet card, or it is unknown how to find
    the hardware address of an interface on the host operating
    system). In this case, spatial uniqueness cannot be
    guaranteed. Nevertheless, a collision should have
    *very* low probability.

    The MAC address of an interface is taken into account only
    on FreeBSD, Linux, and Windows. On other operating
    systems, MySQL uses a randomly generated 48-bit number.

  ```sql
  mysql> SELECT UUID();
          -> '6ccd780c-baba-1026-9564-5b8c656024db'
  ```

  To convert between string and binary UUID values, use the
  [`UUID_TO_BIN()`](miscellaneous-functions.md#function_uuid-to-bin) and
  [`BIN_TO_UUID()`](miscellaneous-functions.md#function_bin-to-uuid) functions. To
  check whether a string is a valid UUID value, use the
  [`IS_UUID()`](miscellaneous-functions.md#function_is-uuid) function.

  This function is unsafe for statement-based replication. A
  warning is logged if you use this function when
  [`binlog_format`](replication-options-binary-log.md#sysvar_binlog_format) is set to
  `STATEMENT`.
- [`UUID_SHORT()`](miscellaneous-functions.md#function_uuid-short)

  Returns a “short” universal identifier as a
  64-bit unsigned integer. Values returned by
  [`UUID_SHORT()`](miscellaneous-functions.md#function_uuid-short) differ from the
  string-format 128-bit identifiers returned by the
  [`UUID()`](miscellaneous-functions.md#function_uuid) function and have
  different uniqueness properties. The value of
  [`UUID_SHORT()`](miscellaneous-functions.md#function_uuid-short) is guaranteed to
  be unique if the following conditions hold:

  - The [`server_id`](replication-options.md#sysvar_server_id) value of
    the current server is between 0 and 255 and is unique
    among your set of source and replica servers
  - You do not set back the system time for your server host
    between [**mysqld**](mysqld.md "6.3.1 mysqld — The MySQL Server") restarts
  - You invoke [`UUID_SHORT()`](miscellaneous-functions.md#function_uuid-short) on
    average fewer than 16 million times per second between
    [**mysqld**](mysqld.md "6.3.1 mysqld — The MySQL Server") restarts

  The [`UUID_SHORT()`](miscellaneous-functions.md#function_uuid-short) return value
  is constructed this way:

  ```clike
    (server_id & 255) << 56
  + (server_startup_time_in_seconds << 24)
  + incremented_variable++;
  ```

  ```sql
  mysql> SELECT UUID_SHORT();
          -> 92395783831158784
  ```

  Note

  [`UUID_SHORT()`](miscellaneous-functions.md#function_uuid-short) does not work
  with statement-based replication.
- [`UUID_TO_BIN(string_uuid)`](miscellaneous-functions.md#function_uuid-to-bin),
  [`UUID_TO_BIN(string_uuid,
  swap_flag)`](miscellaneous-functions.md#function_uuid-to-bin)

  Converts a string UUID to a binary UUID and returns the
  result. (The [`IS_UUID()`](miscellaneous-functions.md#function_is-uuid) function
  description lists the permitted string UUID formats.) The
  return binary UUID is a
  [`VARBINARY(16)`](binary-varbinary.md "13.3.3 The BINARY and VARBINARY Types") value. If the
  UUID argument is `NULL`, the return value is
  `NULL`. If any argument is invalid, an error
  occurs.

  [`UUID_TO_BIN()`](miscellaneous-functions.md#function_uuid-to-bin) takes one or two
  arguments:

  - The one-argument form takes a string UUID value. The
    binary result is in the same order as the string argument.
  - The two-argument form takes a string UUID value and a flag
    value:

    - If *`swap_flag`* is 0, the
      two-argument form is equivalent to the one-argument
      form. The binary result is in the same order as the
      string argument.
    - If *`swap_flag`* is 1, the
      format of the return value differs: The time-low and
      time-high parts (the first and third groups of
      hexadecimal digits, respectively) are swapped. This
      moves the more rapidly varying part to the right and
      can improve indexing efficiency if the result is
      stored in an indexed column.

  Time-part swapping assumes the use of UUID version 1 values,
  such as are generated by the
  [`UUID()`](miscellaneous-functions.md#function_uuid) function. For UUID
  values produced by other means that do not follow version 1
  format, time-part swapping provides no benefit. For details
  about version 1 format, see the
  [`UUID()`](miscellaneous-functions.md#function_uuid) function description.

  Suppose that you have the following string UUID value:

  ```sql
  mysql> SET @uuid = '6ccd780c-baba-1026-9564-5b8c656024db';
  ```

  To convert the string UUID to binary with or without time-part
  swapping, use [`UUID_TO_BIN()`](miscellaneous-functions.md#function_uuid-to-bin):

  ```sql
  mysql> SELECT HEX(UUID_TO_BIN(@uuid));
  +----------------------------------+
  | HEX(UUID_TO_BIN(@uuid))          |
  +----------------------------------+
  | 6CCD780CBABA102695645B8C656024DB |
  +----------------------------------+
  mysql> SELECT HEX(UUID_TO_BIN(@uuid, 0));
  +----------------------------------+
  | HEX(UUID_TO_BIN(@uuid, 0))       |
  +----------------------------------+
  | 6CCD780CBABA102695645B8C656024DB |
  +----------------------------------+
  mysql> SELECT HEX(UUID_TO_BIN(@uuid, 1));
  +----------------------------------+
  | HEX(UUID_TO_BIN(@uuid, 1))       |
  +----------------------------------+
  | 1026BABA6CCD780C95645B8C656024DB |
  +----------------------------------+
  ```

  To convert a binary UUID returned by
  [`UUID_TO_BIN()`](miscellaneous-functions.md#function_uuid-to-bin) to a string UUID,
  use [`BIN_TO_UUID()`](miscellaneous-functions.md#function_bin-to-uuid). If you
  produce a binary UUID by calling
  [`UUID_TO_BIN()`](miscellaneous-functions.md#function_uuid-to-bin) with a second
  argument of 1 to swap time parts, you should also pass a
  second argument of 1 to
  [`BIN_TO_UUID()`](miscellaneous-functions.md#function_bin-to-uuid) to unswap the
  time parts when converting the binary UUID back to a string
  UUID:

  ```sql
  mysql> SELECT BIN_TO_UUID(UUID_TO_BIN(@uuid));
  +--------------------------------------+
  | BIN_TO_UUID(UUID_TO_BIN(@uuid))      |
  +--------------------------------------+
  | 6ccd780c-baba-1026-9564-5b8c656024db |
  +--------------------------------------+
  mysql> SELECT BIN_TO_UUID(UUID_TO_BIN(@uuid,0),0);
  +--------------------------------------+
  | BIN_TO_UUID(UUID_TO_BIN(@uuid,0),0)  |
  +--------------------------------------+
  | 6ccd780c-baba-1026-9564-5b8c656024db |
  +--------------------------------------+
  mysql> SELECT BIN_TO_UUID(UUID_TO_BIN(@uuid,1),1);
  +--------------------------------------+
  | BIN_TO_UUID(UUID_TO_BIN(@uuid,1),1)  |
  +--------------------------------------+
  | 6ccd780c-baba-1026-9564-5b8c656024db |
  +--------------------------------------+
  ```

  If the use of time-part swapping is not the same for the
  conversion in both directions, the original UUID is not
  recovered properly:

  ```sql
  mysql> SELECT BIN_TO_UUID(UUID_TO_BIN(@uuid,0),1);
  +--------------------------------------+
  | BIN_TO_UUID(UUID_TO_BIN(@uuid,0),1)  |
  +--------------------------------------+
  | baba1026-780c-6ccd-9564-5b8c656024db |
  +--------------------------------------+
  mysql> SELECT BIN_TO_UUID(UUID_TO_BIN(@uuid,1),0);
  +--------------------------------------+
  | BIN_TO_UUID(UUID_TO_BIN(@uuid,1),0)  |
  +--------------------------------------+
  | 1026baba-6ccd-780c-9564-5b8c656024db |
  +--------------------------------------+
  ```

  If [`UUID_TO_BIN()`](miscellaneous-functions.md#function_uuid-to-bin) is invoked
  from within the [**mysql**](mysql.md "6.5.1 mysql — The MySQL Command-Line Client") client, binary
  strings display using hexadecimal notation, depending on the
  value of the [`--binary-as-hex`](mysql-command-options.md#option_mysql_binary-as-hex).
  For more information about that option, see
  [Section 6.5.1, “mysql — The MySQL Command-Line Client”](mysql.md "6.5.1 mysql — The MySQL Command-Line Client").
- [`VALUES(col_name)`](miscellaneous-functions.md#function_values)

  In an
  [`INSERT
  ... ON DUPLICATE KEY UPDATE`](insert-on-duplicate.md "15.2.7.2 INSERT ... ON DUPLICATE KEY UPDATE Statement") statement, you can use
  the
  `VALUES(col_name)`
  function in the [`UPDATE`](update.md "15.2.17 UPDATE Statement") clause
  to refer to column values from the
  [`INSERT`](insert.md "15.2.7 INSERT Statement") portion of the
  statement. In other words,
  `VALUES(col_name)`
  in the [`UPDATE`](update.md "15.2.17 UPDATE Statement") clause refers to
  the value of *`col_name`* that would be
  inserted, had no duplicate-key conflict occurred. This
  function is especially useful in multiple-row inserts. The
  [`VALUES()`](miscellaneous-functions.md#function_values) function is meaningful
  only in the `ON DUPLICATE KEY UPDATE` clause
  of [`INSERT`](insert.md "15.2.7 INSERT Statement") statements and
  returns `NULL` otherwise. See
  [Section 15.2.7.2, “INSERT ... ON DUPLICATE KEY UPDATE Statement”](insert-on-duplicate.md "15.2.7.2 INSERT ... ON DUPLICATE KEY UPDATE Statement").

  ```sql
  mysql> INSERT INTO table (a,b,c) VALUES (1,2,3),(4,5,6)
      -> ON DUPLICATE KEY UPDATE c=VALUES(a)+VALUES(b);
  ```

  Important

  This usage is deprecated in MySQL 8.0.20, and is subject to
  removal in a future release of MySQL. Use a row alias, or
  row and column aliases, instead. See
  [Section 15.2.7.2, “INSERT ... ON DUPLICATE KEY UPDATE Statement”](insert-on-duplicate.md "15.2.7.2 INSERT ... ON DUPLICATE KEY UPDATE Statement"), for more information
  and examples.
