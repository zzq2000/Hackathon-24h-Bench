## 29.5 Performance Schema Queries

Pre-filtering limits which event information is collected and is
independent of any particular user. By contrast, post-filtering is
performed by individual users through the use of queries with
appropriate `WHERE` clauses that restrict what
event information to select from the events available after
pre-filtering has been applied.

In [Section 29.4.3, “Event Pre-Filtering”](performance-schema-pre-filtering.md "29.4.3 Event Pre-Filtering"), an example
showed how to pre-filter for file instruments. If the event tables
contain both file and nonfile information, post-filtering is
another way to see information only for file events. Add a
`WHERE` clause to queries to restrict event
selection appropriately:

```sql
mysql> SELECT THREAD_ID, NUMBER_OF_BYTES
       FROM performance_schema.events_waits_history
       WHERE EVENT_NAME LIKE 'wait/io/file/%'
       AND NUMBER_OF_BYTES IS NOT NULL;
+-----------+-----------------+
| THREAD_ID | NUMBER_OF_BYTES |
+-----------+-----------------+
|        11 |              66 |
|        11 |              47 |
|        11 |             139 |
|         5 |              24 |
|         5 |             834 |
+-----------+-----------------+
```

Most Performance Schema tables have indexes, which gives the
optimizer access to execution plans other than full table scans.
These indexes also improve performance for related objects, such
as [`sys`](sys-schema.md "Chapter 30 MySQL sys Schema") schema views that use those
tables. For more information, see
[Section 10.2.4, “Optimizing Performance Schema Queries”](performance-schema-optimization.md "10.2.4 Optimizing Performance Schema Queries").
