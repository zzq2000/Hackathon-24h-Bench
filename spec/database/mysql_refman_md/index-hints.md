### 10.9.4 Index Hints

Index hints give the optimizer information about how to choose
indexes during query processing. Index hints, described here,
differ from optimizer hints, described in
[Section 10.9.3, “Optimizer Hints”](optimizer-hints.md "10.9.3 Optimizer Hints"). Index and optimizer hints may
be used separately or together.

Index hints apply to [`SELECT`](select.md "15.2.13 SELECT Statement") and
[`UPDATE`](update.md "15.2.17 UPDATE Statement") statements. They also work
with multi-table [`DELETE`](delete.md "15.2.2 DELETE Statement")
statements, but not with single-table `DELETE`,
as shown later in this section.

Index hints are specified following a table name. (For the
general syntax for specifying tables in a
[`SELECT`](select.md "15.2.13 SELECT Statement") statement, see
[Section 15.2.13.2, “JOIN Clause”](join.md "15.2.13.2 JOIN Clause").) The syntax for referring to an
individual table, including index hints, looks like this:

```sql
tbl_name [[AS] alias] [index_hint_list]

index_hint_list:
    index_hint [index_hint] ...

index_hint:
    USE {INDEX|KEY}
      [FOR {JOIN|ORDER BY|GROUP BY}] ([index_list])
  | {IGNORE|FORCE} {INDEX|KEY}
      [FOR {JOIN|ORDER BY|GROUP BY}] (index_list)

index_list:
    index_name [, index_name] ...
```

The `USE INDEX
(index_list)` hint tells
MySQL to use only one of the named indexes to find rows in the
table. The alternative syntax `IGNORE INDEX
(index_list)` tells MySQL to
not use some particular index or indexes. These hints are useful
if [`EXPLAIN`](explain.md "15.8.2 EXPLAIN Statement") shows that MySQL is
using the wrong index from the list of possible indexes.

The `FORCE INDEX` hint acts like `USE
INDEX (index_list)`, with
the addition that a table scan is assumed to be
*very* expensive. In other words, a table
scan is used only if there is no way to use one of the named
indexes to find rows in the table.

Note

As of MySQL 8.0.20, the server supports the index-level
optimizer hints [`JOIN_INDEX`](optimizer-hints.md#optimizer-hints-index-level "Index-Level Optimizer Hints"),
[`GROUP_INDEX`](optimizer-hints.md#optimizer-hints-index-level "Index-Level Optimizer Hints"),
[`ORDER_INDEX`](optimizer-hints.md#optimizer-hints-index-level "Index-Level Optimizer Hints"), and
[`INDEX`](optimizer-hints.md#optimizer-hints-index-level "Index-Level Optimizer Hints"), which are equivalent
to and intended to supersede `FORCE INDEX`
index hints, as well as the
[`NO_JOIN_INDEX`](optimizer-hints.md#optimizer-hints-index-level "Index-Level Optimizer Hints"),
[`NO_GROUP_INDEX`](optimizer-hints.md#optimizer-hints-index-level "Index-Level Optimizer Hints"),
[`NO_ORDER_INDEX`](optimizer-hints.md#optimizer-hints-index-level "Index-Level Optimizer Hints"), and
[`NO_INDEX`](optimizer-hints.md#optimizer-hints-index-level "Index-Level Optimizer Hints") optimizer hints,
which are equivalent to and intended to supersede
`IGNORE INDEX` index hints. Thus, you should
expect `USE INDEX`, `FORCE
INDEX`, and `IGNORE INDEX` to be
deprecated in a future release of MySQL, and at some time
thereafter to be removed altogether.

These index-level optimizer hints are supported with both
single-table and multi-table
[`DELETE`](delete.md "15.2.2 DELETE Statement") statements.

For more information, see
[Index-Level Optimizer Hints](optimizer-hints.md#optimizer-hints-index-level "Index-Level Optimizer Hints").

Each hint requires index names, not column names. To refer to a
primary key, use the name `PRIMARY`. To see the
index names for a table, use the [`SHOW
INDEX`](show-index.md "15.7.7.22 SHOW INDEX Statement") statement or the Information Schema
[`STATISTICS`](information-schema-statistics-table.md "28.3.34 The INFORMATION_SCHEMA STATISTICS Table") table.

An *`index_name`* value need not be a
full index name. It can be an unambiguous prefix of an index
name. If a prefix is ambiguous, an error occurs.

Examples:

```sql
SELECT * FROM table1 USE INDEX (col1_index,col2_index)
  WHERE col1=1 AND col2=2 AND col3=3;

SELECT * FROM table1 IGNORE INDEX (col3_index)
  WHERE col1=1 AND col2=2 AND col3=3;
```

The syntax for index hints has the following characteristics:

- It is syntactically valid to omit
  *`index_list`* for `USE
  INDEX`, which means “use no indexes.”
  Omitting *`index_list`* for
  `FORCE INDEX` or `IGNORE
  INDEX` is a syntax error.
- You can specify the scope of an index hint by adding a
  `FOR` clause to the hint. This provides
  more fine-grained control over optimizer selection of an
  execution plan for various phases of query processing. To
  affect only the indexes used when MySQL decides how to find
  rows in the table and how to process joins, use `FOR
  JOIN`. To influence index usage for sorting or
  grouping rows, use `FOR ORDER BY` or
  `FOR GROUP BY`.
- You can specify multiple index hints:

  ```sql
  SELECT * FROM t1 USE INDEX (i1) IGNORE INDEX FOR ORDER BY (i2) ORDER BY a;
  ```

  It is not an error to name the same index in several hints
  (even within the same hint):

  ```sql
  SELECT * FROM t1 USE INDEX (i1) USE INDEX (i1,i1);
  ```

  However, it is an error to mix `USE INDEX`
  and `FORCE INDEX` for the same table:

  ```sql
  SELECT * FROM t1 USE INDEX FOR JOIN (i1) FORCE INDEX FOR JOIN (i2);
  ```

If an index hint includes no `FOR` clause, the
scope of the hint is to apply to all parts of the statement. For
example, this hint:

```sql
IGNORE INDEX (i1)
```

is equivalent to this combination of hints:

```sql
IGNORE INDEX FOR JOIN (i1)
IGNORE INDEX FOR ORDER BY (i1)
IGNORE INDEX FOR GROUP BY (i1)
```

In MySQL 5.0, hint scope with no `FOR` clause
was to apply only to row retrieval. To cause the server to use
this older behavior when no `FOR` clause is
present, enable the [`old`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_old) system
variable at server startup. Take care about enabling this
variable in a replication setup. With statement-based binary
logging, having different modes for the source and replicas
might lead to replication errors.

When index hints are processed, they are collected in a single
list by type (`USE`, `FORCE`,
`IGNORE`) and by scope (`FOR
JOIN`, `FOR ORDER BY`, `FOR
GROUP BY`). For example:

```sql
SELECT * FROM t1
  USE INDEX () IGNORE INDEX (i2) USE INDEX (i1) USE INDEX (i2);
```

is equivalent to:

```sql
SELECT * FROM t1
   USE INDEX (i1,i2) IGNORE INDEX (i2);
```

The index hints then are applied for each scope in the following
order:

1. `{USE|FORCE} INDEX` is applied if present.
   (If not, the optimizer-determined set of indexes is used.)
2. `IGNORE INDEX` is applied over the result
   of the previous step. For example, the following two queries
   are equivalent:

   ```sql
   SELECT * FROM t1 USE INDEX (i1) IGNORE INDEX (i2) USE INDEX (i2);

   SELECT * FROM t1 USE INDEX (i1);
   ```

For `FULLTEXT` searches, index hints work as
follows:

- For natural language mode searches, index hints are silently
  ignored. For example, `IGNORE INDEX(i1)` is
  ignored with no warning and the index is still used.
- For boolean mode searches, index hints with `FOR
  ORDER BY` or `FOR GROUP BY` are
  silently ignored. Index hints with `FOR
  JOIN` or no `FOR` modifier are
  honored. In contrast to how hints apply for
  non-`FULLTEXT` searches, the hint is used
  for all phases of query execution (finding rows and
  retrieval, grouping, and ordering). This is true even if the
  hint is given for a non-`FULLTEXT` index.

  For example, the following two queries are equivalent:

  ```sql
  SELECT * FROM t
    USE INDEX (index1)
    IGNORE INDEX FOR ORDER BY (index1)
    IGNORE INDEX FOR GROUP BY (index1)
    WHERE ... IN BOOLEAN MODE ... ;

  SELECT * FROM t
    USE INDEX (index1)
    WHERE ... IN BOOLEAN MODE ... ;
  ```

Index hints work with [`DELETE`](delete.md "15.2.2 DELETE Statement")
statements, but only if you use multi-table
`DELETE` syntax, as shown here:

```sql
mysql> EXPLAIN DELETE FROM t1 USE INDEX(col2)
    -> WHERE col1 BETWEEN 1 AND 100 AND COL2 BETWEEN 1 AND 100\G
ERROR 1064 (42000): You have an error in your SQL syntax; check the manual that
corresponds to your MySQL server version for the right syntax to use near 'use
index(col2) where col1 between 1 and 100 and col2 between 1 and 100' at line 1
