#### 17.6.2.4 InnoDB Full-Text Indexes

Full-text indexes are created on text-based columns
([`CHAR`](char.md "13.3.2 The CHAR and VARCHAR Types"),
[`VARCHAR`](char.md "13.3.2 The CHAR and VARCHAR Types"), or
[`TEXT`](blob.md "13.3.4 The BLOB and TEXT Types") columns) to speed up queries
and DML operations on data contained within those columns.

A full-text index is defined as part of a
[`CREATE TABLE`](create-table.md "15.1.20 CREATE TABLE Statement") statement or added to
an existing table using [`ALTER TABLE`](alter-table.md "15.1.9 ALTER TABLE Statement")
or [`CREATE INDEX`](create-index.md "15.1.15 CREATE INDEX Statement").

Full-text search is performed using [`MATCH()
... AGAINST`](fulltext-search.md#function_match) syntax. For usage information, see
[Section 14.9, “Full-Text Search Functions”](fulltext-search.md "14.9 Full-Text Search Functions").

##### InnoDB Full-Text Index Design

`InnoDB` full-text indexes have an inverted
index design. Inverted indexes store a list of words, and for
each word, a list of documents that the word appears in. To
support proximity search, position information for each word is
also stored, as a byte offset.

##### InnoDB Full-Text Index Tables

When an `InnoDB` full-text index is created, a
set of index tables is created, as shown in the following
example:

```sql
mysql> CREATE TABLE opening_lines (
       id INT UNSIGNED AUTO_INCREMENT NOT NULL PRIMARY KEY,
       opening_line TEXT(500),
       author VARCHAR(200),
       title VARCHAR(200),
       FULLTEXT idx (opening_line)
       ) ENGINE=InnoDB;

mysql> SELECT table_id, name, space from INFORMATION_SCHEMA.INNODB_TABLES
       WHERE name LIKE 'test/%';
+----------+----------------------------------------------------+-------+
| table_id | name                                               | space |
+----------+----------------------------------------------------+-------+
|      333 | test/fts_0000000000000147_00000000000001c9_index_1 |   289 |
|      334 | test/fts_0000000000000147_00000000000001c9_index_2 |   290 |
|      335 | test/fts_0000000000000147_00000000000001c9_index_3 |   291 |
|      336 | test/fts_0000000000000147_00000000000001c9_index_4 |   292 |
|      337 | test/fts_0000000000000147_00000000000001c9_index_5 |   293 |
|      338 | test/fts_0000000000000147_00000000000001c9_index_6 |   294 |
|      330 | test/fts_0000000000000147_being_deleted            |   286 |
|      331 | test/fts_0000000000000147_being_deleted_cache      |   287 |
|      332 | test/fts_0000000000000147_config                   |   288 |
|      328 | test/fts_0000000000000147_deleted                  |   284 |
|      329 | test/fts_0000000000000147_deleted_cache            |   285 |
|      327 | test/opening_lines                                 |   283 |
+----------+----------------------------------------------------+-------+
```

The first six index tables comprise the inverted index and are
referred to as auxiliary index tables. When incoming documents
are tokenized, the individual words (also referred to as
“tokens”) are inserted into the index tables along
with position information and an associated
`DOC_ID`. The words are fully sorted and
partitioned among the six index tables based on the character
set sort weight of the word's first character.

The inverted index is partitioned into six auxiliary index
tables to support parallel index creation. By default, two
threads tokenize, sort, and insert words and associated data
into the index tables. The number of threads that perform this
work is configurable using the
[`innodb_ft_sort_pll_degree`](innodb-parameters.md#sysvar_innodb_ft_sort_pll_degree)
variable. Consider increasing the number of threads when
creating full-text indexes on large tables.

Auxiliary index table names are prefixed with
`fts_` and postfixed with
`index_#`. Each
auxiliary index table is associated with the indexed table by a
hex value in the auxiliary index table name that matches the
`table_id` of the indexed table. For example,
the `table_id` of the
`test/opening_lines` table is
`327`, for which the hex value is 0x147. As
shown in the preceding example, the “147” hex value
appears in the names of auxiliary index tables that are
associated with the `test/opening_lines` table.

A hex value representing the `index_id` of the
full-text index also appears in auxiliary index table names. For
example, in the auxiliary table name
`test/fts_0000000000000147_00000000000001c9_index_1`,
the hex value `1c9` has a decimal value of 457.
The index defined on the `opening_lines` table
(`idx`) can be identified by querying the
Information Schema [`INNODB_INDEXES`](information-schema-innodb-indexes-table.md "28.4.20 The INFORMATION_SCHEMA INNODB_INDEXES Table")
table for this value (457).

```sql
mysql> SELECT index_id, name, table_id, space from INFORMATION_SCHEMA.INNODB_INDEXES
       WHERE index_id=457;
+----------+------+----------+-------+
| index_id | name | table_id | space |
+----------+------+----------+-------+
|      457 | idx  |      327 |   283 |
+----------+------+----------+-------+
```

Index tables are stored in their own tablespace if the primary
table is created in a
[file-per-table](glossary.md#glos_file_per_table "file-per-table")
tablespace. Otherwise, index tables are stored in the tablespace
where the indexed table resides.

The other index tables shown in the preceding example are
referred to as common index tables and are used for deletion
handling and storing the internal state of full-text indexes.
Unlike the inverted index tables, which are created for each
full-text index, this set of tables is common to all full-text
indexes created on a particular table.

Common index tables are retained even if full-text indexes are
dropped. When a full-text index is dropped, the
`FTS_DOC_ID` column that was created for the
index is retained, as removing the `FTS_DOC_ID`
column would require rebuilding the previously indexed table.
Common index tables are required to manage the
`FTS_DOC_ID` column.

- `fts_*_deleted` and
  `fts_*_deleted_cache`

  Contain the document IDs (DOC\_ID) for documents that are
  deleted but whose data is not yet removed from the full-text
  index. The `fts_*_deleted_cache` is the
  in-memory version of the `fts_*_deleted`
  table.
- `fts_*_being_deleted` and
  `fts_*_being_deleted_cache`

  Contain the document IDs (DOC\_ID) for documents that are
  deleted and whose data is currently in the process of being
  removed from the full-text index. The
  `fts_*_being_deleted_cache` table is the
  in-memory version of the
  `fts_*_being_deleted` table.
- `fts_*_config`

  Stores information about the internal state of the full-text
  index. Most importantly, it stores the
  `FTS_SYNCED_DOC_ID`, which identifies
  documents that have been parsed and flushed to disk. In case
  of crash recovery, `FTS_SYNCED_DOC_ID`
  values are used to identify documents that have not been
  flushed to disk so that the documents can be re-parsed and
  added back to the full-text index cache. To view the data in
  this table, query the Information Schema
  [`INNODB_FT_CONFIG`](information-schema-innodb-ft-config-table.md "28.4.15 The INFORMATION_SCHEMA INNODB_FT_CONFIG Table") table.

##### InnoDB Full-Text Index Cache

When a document is inserted, it is tokenized, and the individual
words and associated data are inserted into the full-text index.
This process, even for small documents, can result in numerous
small insertions into the auxiliary index tables, making
concurrent access to these tables a point of contention. To
avoid this problem, `InnoDB` uses a full-text
index cache to temporarily cache index table insertions for
recently inserted rows. This in-memory cache structure holds
insertions until the cache is full and then batch flushes them
to disk (to the auxiliary index tables). You can query the
Information Schema
[`INNODB_FT_INDEX_CACHE`](information-schema-innodb-ft-index-cache-table.md "28.4.18 The INFORMATION_SCHEMA INNODB_FT_INDEX_CACHE Table") table to view
tokenized data for recently inserted rows.

The caching and batch flushing behavior avoids frequent updates
to auxiliary index tables, which could result in concurrent
access issues during busy insert and update times. The batching
technique also avoids multiple insertions for the same word, and
minimizes duplicate entries. Instead of flushing each word
individually, insertions for the same word are merged and
flushed to disk as a single entry, improving insertion
efficiency while keeping auxiliary index tables as small as
possible.

The [`innodb_ft_cache_size`](innodb-parameters.md#sysvar_innodb_ft_cache_size)
variable is used to configure the full-text index cache size (on
a per-table basis), which affects how often the full-text index
cache is flushed. You can also define a global full-text index
cache size limit for all tables in a given instance using the
[`innodb_ft_total_cache_size`](innodb-parameters.md#sysvar_innodb_ft_total_cache_size)
variable.

The full-text index cache stores the same information as
auxiliary index tables. However, the full-text index cache only
caches tokenized data for recently inserted rows. The data that
is already flushed to disk (to the auxiliary index tables) is
not brought back into the full-text index cache when queried.
The data in auxiliary index tables is queried directly, and
results from the auxiliary index tables are merged with results
from the full-text index cache before being returned.

##### InnoDB Full-Text Index DOC\_ID and FTS\_DOC\_ID Column

`InnoDB` uses a unique document identifier
referred to as the `DOC_ID` to map words in the
full-text index to document records where the word appears. The
mapping requires an `FTS_DOC_ID` column on the
indexed table. If an `FTS_DOC_ID` column is not
defined, `InnoDB` automatically adds a hidden
`FTS_DOC_ID` column when the full-text index is
created. The following example demonstrates this behavior.

The following table definition does not include an
`FTS_DOC_ID` column:

```sql
mysql> CREATE TABLE opening_lines (
       id INT UNSIGNED AUTO_INCREMENT NOT NULL PRIMARY KEY,
       opening_line TEXT(500),
       author VARCHAR(200),
       title VARCHAR(200)
       ) ENGINE=InnoDB;
```

When you create a full-text index on the table using
`CREATE FULLTEXT INDEX` syntax, a warning is
returned which reports that `InnoDB` is
rebuilding the table to add the `FTS_DOC_ID`
column.

```sql
mysql> CREATE FULLTEXT INDEX idx ON opening_lines(opening_line);
Query OK, 0 rows affected, 1 warning (0.19 sec)
Records: 0  Duplicates: 0  Warnings: 1

mysql> SHOW WARNINGS;
+---------+------+--------------------------------------------------+
| Level   | Code | Message                                          |
+---------+------+--------------------------------------------------+
| Warning |  124 | InnoDB rebuilding table to add column FTS_DOC_ID |
+---------+------+--------------------------------------------------+
```

The same warning is returned when using
[`ALTER TABLE`](alter-table.md "15.1.9 ALTER TABLE Statement") to add a full-text
index to a table that does not have an
`FTS_DOC_ID` column. If you create a full-text
index at [`CREATE TABLE`](create-table.md "15.1.20 CREATE TABLE Statement") time and do
not specify an `FTS_DOC_ID` column,
`InnoDB` adds a hidden
`FTS_DOC_ID` column, without warning.

Defining an `FTS_DOC_ID` column at
[`CREATE TABLE`](create-table.md "15.1.20 CREATE TABLE Statement") time is less
expensive than creating a full-text index on a table that is
already loaded with data. If an `FTS_DOC_ID`
column is defined on a table prior to loading data, the table
and its indexes do not have to be rebuilt to add the new column.
If you are not concerned with `CREATE FULLTEXT
INDEX` performance, leave out the
`FTS_DOC_ID` column to have
`InnoDB` create it for you.
`InnoDB` creates a hidden
`FTS_DOC_ID` column along with a unique index
(`FTS_DOC_ID_INDEX`) on the
`FTS_DOC_ID` column. If you want to create your
own `FTS_DOC_ID` column, the column must be
defined as `BIGINT UNSIGNED NOT NULL` and named
`FTS_DOC_ID` (all uppercase), as in the
following example:

Note

The `FTS_DOC_ID` column does not need to be
defined as an `AUTO_INCREMENT` column, but
doing so could make loading data easier.

```sql
mysql> CREATE TABLE opening_lines (
       FTS_DOC_ID BIGINT UNSIGNED AUTO_INCREMENT NOT NULL PRIMARY KEY,
       opening_line TEXT(500),
       author VARCHAR(200),
       title VARCHAR(200)
       ) ENGINE=InnoDB;
```

If you choose to define the `FTS_DOC_ID` column
yourself, you are responsible for managing the column to avoid
empty or duplicate values. `FTS_DOC_ID` values
cannot be reused, which means `FTS_DOC_ID`
values must be ever increasing.

Optionally, you can create the required unique
`FTS_DOC_ID_INDEX` (all uppercase) on the
`FTS_DOC_ID` column.

```sql
mysql> CREATE UNIQUE INDEX FTS_DOC_ID_INDEX on opening_lines(FTS_DOC_ID);
```

If you do not create the `FTS_DOC_ID_INDEX`,
`InnoDB` creates it automatically.

Note

`FTS_DOC_ID_INDEX` cannot be defined as a
descending index because the `InnoDB` SQL
parser does not use descending indexes.

The permitted gap between the largest used
`FTS_DOC_ID` value and new
`FTS_DOC_ID` value is 65535.

To avoid rebuilding the table, the `FTS_DOC_ID`
column is retained when dropping a full-text index.

##### InnoDB Full-Text Index Deletion Handling

Deleting a record that has a full-text index column could result
in numerous small deletions in the auxiliary index tables,
making concurrent access to these tables a point of contention.
To avoid this problem, the `DOC_ID` of a
deleted document is logged in a special
`FTS_*_DELETED` table whenever a record is
deleted from an indexed table, and the indexed record remains in
the full-text index. Before returning query results, information
in the `FTS_*_DELETED` table is used to filter
out deleted `DOC_ID`s. The benefit of this
design is that deletions are fast and inexpensive. The drawback
is that the size of the index is not immediately reduced after
deleting records. To remove full-text index entries for deleted
records, run `OPTIMIZE TABLE` on the indexed
table with
[`innodb_optimize_fulltext_only=ON`](innodb-parameters.md#sysvar_innodb_optimize_fulltext_only)
to rebuild the full-text index. For more information, see
[Optimizing InnoDB Full-Text Indexes](fulltext-fine-tuning.md#fulltext-optimize "Optimizing InnoDB Full-Text Indexes").

##### InnoDB Full-Text Index Transaction Handling

`InnoDB` full-text indexes have special
transaction handling characteristics due its caching and batch
processing behavior. Specifically, updates and insertions on a
full-text index are processed at transaction commit time, which
means that a full-text search can only see committed data. The
following example demonstrates this behavior. The full-text
search only returns a result after the inserted lines are
committed.

```sql
mysql> CREATE TABLE opening_lines (
       id INT UNSIGNED AUTO_INCREMENT NOT NULL PRIMARY KEY,
       opening_line TEXT(500),
       author VARCHAR(200),
       title VARCHAR(200),
       FULLTEXT idx (opening_line)
       ) ENGINE=InnoDB;

mysql> BEGIN;

mysql> INSERT INTO opening_lines(opening_line,author,title) VALUES
       ('Call me Ishmael.','Herman Melville','Moby-Dick'),
       ('A screaming comes across the sky.','Thomas Pynchon','Gravity\'s Rainbow'),
       ('I am an invisible man.','Ralph Ellison','Invisible Man'),
       ('Where now? Who now? When now?','Samuel Beckett','The Unnamable'),
       ('It was love at first sight.','Joseph Heller','Catch-22'),
       ('All this happened, more or less.','Kurt Vonnegut','Slaughterhouse-Five'),
       ('Mrs. Dalloway said she would buy the flowers herself.','Virginia Woolf','Mrs. Dalloway'),
       ('It was a pleasure to burn.','Ray Bradbury','Fahrenheit 451');

mysql> SELECT COUNT(*) FROM opening_lines WHERE MATCH(opening_line) AGAINST('Ishmael');
+----------+
| COUNT(*) |
+----------+
|        0 |
+----------+

mysql> COMMIT;

mysql> SELECT COUNT(*) FROM opening_lines WHERE MATCH(opening_line) AGAINST('Ishmael');
+----------+
| COUNT(*) |
+----------+
|        1 |
+----------+
```
