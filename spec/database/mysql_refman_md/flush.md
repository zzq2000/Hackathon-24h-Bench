#### 15.7.8.3 FLUSH Statement

```sql
FLUSH [NO_WRITE_TO_BINLOG | LOCAL] {
    flush_option [, flush_option] ...
  | tables_option
}

flush_option: {
    BINARY LOGS
  | ENGINE LOGS
  | ERROR LOGS
  | GENERAL LOGS
  | HOSTS
  | LOGS
  | PRIVILEGES
  | OPTIMIZER_COSTS
  | RELAY LOGS [FOR CHANNEL channel]
  | SLOW LOGS
  | STATUS

}

tables_option: {
    table_synonym
  | table_synonym tbl_name [, tbl_name] ...
  | table_synonym WITH READ LOCK
  | table_synonym tbl_name [, tbl_name] ... WITH READ LOCK

}

table_synonym: {
    TABLE
  | TABLES
}
```

The [`FLUSH`](flush.md "15.7.8.3 FLUSH Statement") statement has several
variant forms that clear or reload various internal caches,
flush tables, or acquire locks. Each
[`FLUSH`](flush.md "15.7.8.3 FLUSH Statement") operation requires the
privileges indicated in its description.

Note

It is not possible to issue
[`FLUSH`](flush.md "15.7.8.3 FLUSH Statement") statements within stored
functions or triggers. However, you may use
[`FLUSH`](flush.md "15.7.8.3 FLUSH Statement") in stored procedures, so
long as these are not called from stored functions or
triggers. See [Section 27.8, “Restrictions on Stored Programs”](stored-program-restrictions.md "27.8 Restrictions on Stored Programs").

By default, the server writes
[`FLUSH`](flush.md "15.7.8.3 FLUSH Statement") statements to the binary
log so that they replicate to replicas. To suppress logging,
specify the optional `NO_WRITE_TO_BINLOG`
keyword or its alias `LOCAL`.

Note

[`FLUSH LOGS`](flush.md#flush-logs),
[`FLUSH BINARY LOGS`](flush.md#flush-binary-logs),
[`FLUSH TABLES WITH READ LOCK`](flush.md#flush-tables-with-read-lock)
(with or without a table list), and
[`FLUSH
TABLES tbl_name ... FOR
EXPORT`](flush.md#flush-tables-for-export-with-list) are not written to the binary log in any case
because they would cause problems if replicated to a replica.

The [`FLUSH`](flush.md "15.7.8.3 FLUSH Statement") statement causes an
implicit commit. See [Section 15.3.3, “Statements That Cause an Implicit Commit”](implicit-commit.md "15.3.3 Statements That Cause an Implicit Commit").

The [**mysqladmin**](mysqladmin.md "6.5.2 mysqladmin — A MySQL Server Administration Program") utility provides a
command-line interface to some flush operations, using commands
such as `flush-hosts`,
`flush-logs`,
`flush-privileges`,
`flush-status`, and
`flush-tables`. See
[Section 6.5.2, “mysqladmin — A MySQL Server Administration Program”](mysqladmin.md "6.5.2 mysqladmin — A MySQL Server Administration Program").

Sending a `SIGHUP` or
`SIGUSR1` signal to the server causes several
flush operations to occur that are similar to various forms of
the [`FLUSH`](flush.md "15.7.8.3 FLUSH Statement") statement. Signals can
be sent by the `root` system account or the
system account that owns the server process. This enables the
flush operations to be performed without having to connect to
the server, which requires a MySQL account that has privileges
sufficient for those operations. See
[Section 6.10, “Unix Signal Handling in MySQL”](unix-signal-response.md "6.10 Unix Signal Handling in MySQL").

The [`RESET`](reset.md "15.7.8.6 RESET Statement") statement is similar to
[`FLUSH`](flush.md "15.7.8.3 FLUSH Statement"). See
[Section 15.7.8.6, “RESET Statement”](reset.md "15.7.8.6 RESET Statement"), for information about using
[`RESET`](reset.md "15.7.8.6 RESET Statement") with replication.

The following list describes the permitted
[`FLUSH`](flush.md "15.7.8.3 FLUSH Statement") statement
*`flush_option`* values. For descriptions
of the permitted *`tables_option`*
values, see [FLUSH TABLES Syntax](flush.md#flush-tables-variants "FLUSH TABLES Syntax").

- [`FLUSH BINARY LOGS`](flush.md#flush-binary-logs)

  Closes and reopens any binary log file to which the server
  is writing. If binary logging is enabled, the sequence
  number of the binary log file is incremented by one relative
  to the previous file.

  This operation requires the
  [`RELOAD`](privileges-provided.md#priv_reload) privilege.
- [`FLUSH ENGINE LOGS`](flush.md#flush-engine-logs)

  Closes and reopens any flushable logs for installed storage
  engines. This causes `InnoDB` to flush its
  logs to disk.

  This operation requires the
  [`RELOAD`](privileges-provided.md#priv_reload) privilege.
- [`FLUSH ERROR LOGS`](flush.md#flush-error-logs)

  Closes and reopens any error log file to which the server is
  writing.

  This operation requires the
  [`RELOAD`](privileges-provided.md#priv_reload) privilege.
- [`FLUSH GENERAL LOGS`](flush.md#flush-general-logs)

  Closes and reopens any general query log file to which the
  server is writing.

  This operation requires the
  [`RELOAD`](privileges-provided.md#priv_reload) privilege.

  This operation has no effect on tables used for the general
  query log (see [Section 7.4.1, “Selecting General Query Log and Slow Query Log Output Destinations”](log-destinations.md "7.4.1 Selecting General Query Log and Slow Query Log Output Destinations")).
- [`FLUSH HOSTS`](flush.md#flush-hosts)

  Empties the host cache and the Performance Schema
  [`host_cache`](performance-schema-host-cache-table.md "29.12.21.3 The host_cache Table") table that exposes
  the cache contents, and unblocks any blocked hosts.

  This operation requires the
  [`RELOAD`](privileges-provided.md#priv_reload) privilege.

  For information about why host cache flushing might be
  advisable or desirable, see [Section 7.1.12.3, “DNS Lookups and the Host Cache”](host-cache.md "7.1.12.3 DNS Lookups and the Host Cache").

  Note

  [`FLUSH HOSTS`](flush.md#flush-hosts) is deprecated
  as of MySQL 8.0.23; expect it to be removed in a future
  MySQL release. Instead, truncate the Performance Schema
  [`host_cache`](performance-schema-host-cache-table.md "29.12.21.3 The host_cache Table") table:

  ```sql
  TRUNCATE TABLE performance_schema.host_cache;
  ```

  The [`TRUNCATE TABLE`](truncate-table.md "15.1.37 TRUNCATE TABLE Statement")
  operation requires the [`DROP`](privileges-provided.md#priv_drop)
  privilege for the table rather than the
  [`RELOAD`](privileges-provided.md#priv_reload) privilege. You
  should be aware that the `TRUNCATE TABLE`
  statement is not written to the binary log. To obtain the
  same behavior from `FLUSH HOSTS`, specify
  `NO_WRITE_TO_BINLOG` or
  `LOCAL` as part of the statement.
- [`FLUSH LOGS`](flush.md#flush-logs)

  Closes and reopens any log file to which the server is
  writing.

  This operation requires the
  [`RELOAD`](privileges-provided.md#priv_reload) privilege.

  The effect of this operation is equivalent to the combined
  effects of these operations:

  ```sql
  FLUSH BINARY LOGS
  FLUSH ENGINE LOGS
  FLUSH ERROR LOGS
  FLUSH GENERAL LOGS
  FLUSH RELAY LOGS
  FLUSH SLOW LOGS
  ```
- [`FLUSH OPTIMIZER_COSTS`](flush.md#flush-optimizer-costs)

  Re-reads the cost model tables so that the optimizer starts
  using the current cost estimates stored in them.

  This operation requires the
  [`FLUSH_OPTIMIZER_COSTS`](privileges-provided.md#priv_flush-optimizer-costs) or
  [`RELOAD`](privileges-provided.md#priv_reload) privilege.

  The server writes a warning to the error log for any
  unrecognized cost model table entries. For information about
  these tables, see [Section 10.9.5, “The Optimizer Cost Model”](cost-model.md "10.9.5 The Optimizer Cost Model"). This
  operation affects only sessions that begin subsequent to the
  flush. Existing sessions continue to use the cost estimates
  that were current when they began.
- [`FLUSH PRIVILEGES`](flush.md#flush-privileges)

  Re-reads the privileges from the grant tables in the
  `mysql` system schema. As part of this
  operation, the server reads the
  `global_grants` table containing dynamic
  privilege assignments and registers any unregistered
  privileges found there.

  Reloading the grant tables is necessary to enable updates to
  MySQL privileges and users only if you make such changes
  directly to the grant tables; it is not needed for account
  management statements such as
  [`GRANT`](grant.md "15.7.1.6 GRANT Statement") or
  [`REVOKE`](revoke.md "15.7.1.8 REVOKE Statement"), which take effect
  immediately. See [Section 8.2.13, “When Privilege Changes Take Effect”](privilege-changes.md "8.2.13 When Privilege Changes Take Effect"), for
  more information.

  This operation requires the
  [`RELOAD`](privileges-provided.md#priv_reload) privilege.

  If the [`--skip-grant-tables`](server-options.md#option_mysqld_skip-grant-tables)
  option was specified at server startup to disable the MySQL
  privilege system, [`FLUSH
  PRIVILEGES`](flush.md#flush-privileges) provides a way to enable the privilege
  system at runtime.

  Resets failed-login tracking (or enables it if the server
  was started with
  [`--skip-grant-tables`](server-options.md#option_mysqld_skip-grant-tables)) and
  unlocks any temporarily locked accounts. See
  [Section 8.2.15, “Password Management”](password-management.md "8.2.15 Password Management").

  Frees memory cached by the server as a result of
  [`GRANT`](grant.md "15.7.1.6 GRANT Statement"),
  [`CREATE USER`](create-user.md "15.7.1.3 CREATE USER Statement"),
  [`CREATE SERVER`](create-server.md "15.1.18 CREATE SERVER Statement"), and
  [`INSTALL PLUGIN`](install-plugin.md "15.7.4.4 INSTALL PLUGIN Statement") statements.
  This memory is not released by the corresponding
  [`REVOKE`](revoke.md "15.7.1.8 REVOKE Statement"),
  [`DROP USER`](drop-user.md "15.7.1.5 DROP USER Statement"),
  [`DROP SERVER`](drop-server.md "15.1.30 DROP SERVER Statement"), and
  [`UNINSTALL PLUGIN`](uninstall-plugin.md "15.7.4.6 UNINSTALL PLUGIN Statement") statements,
  so for a server that executes many instances of the
  statements that cause caching, there is an increase in
  cached memory use unless it is freed with
  [`FLUSH PRIVILEGES`](flush.md#flush-privileges).

  Clears the in-memory cache used by the
  `caching_sha2_password` authentication
  plugin. See
  [Cache Operation for SHA-2 Pluggable Authentication](caching-sha2-pluggable-authentication.md#caching-sha2-pluggable-authentication-cache-operation "Cache Operation for SHA-2 Pluggable Authentication").
- [`FLUSH
  RELAY LOGS [FOR CHANNEL
  channel]`](flush.md#flush-relay-logs)

  Closes and reopens any relay log file to which the server is
  writing. If relay logging is enabled, the sequence number of
  the relay log file is incremented by one relative to the
  previous file.

  This operation requires the
  [`RELOAD`](privileges-provided.md#priv_reload) privilege.

  The `FOR CHANNEL
  channel` clause enables
  you to name which replication channel the operation applies
  to. Execute
  [`FLUSH
  RELAY LOGS FOR CHANNEL
  channel`](flush.md#flush-relay-logs) to flush the
  relay log for a specific replication channel. If no channel
  is named and no extra replication channels exist, the
  operation applies to the default channel. If no channel is
  named and multiple replication channels exist, the operation
  applies to all replication channels. For more information,
  see [Section 19.2.2, “Replication Channels”](replication-channels.md "19.2.2 Replication Channels").
- [`FLUSH SLOW LOGS`](flush.md#flush-slow-logs)

  Closes and reopens any slow query log file to which the
  server is writing.

  This operation requires the
  [`RELOAD`](privileges-provided.md#priv_reload) privilege.

  This operation has no effect on tables used for the slow
  query log (see [Section 7.4.1, “Selecting General Query Log and Slow Query Log Output Destinations”](log-destinations.md "7.4.1 Selecting General Query Log and Slow Query Log Output Destinations")).
- [`FLUSH STATUS`](flush.md#flush-status)

  Flushes status indicators.

  This operation adds the current thread's session status
  variable values to the global values and resets the session
  values to zero. Some global variables may be reset to zero
  as well. It also resets the counters for key caches (default
  and named) to zero and sets
  [`Max_used_connections`](server-status-variables.md#statvar_Max_used_connections) to
  the current number of open connections. This information may
  be of use when debugging a query. See
  [Section 1.5, “How to Report Bugs or Problems”](bug-reports.md "1.5 How to Report Bugs or Problems").

  `FLUSH STATUS` is unaffected by
  [`read_only`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_read_only) or
  [`super_read_only`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_super_read_only), and is
  always written to the binary log.

  This operation requires the
  [`FLUSH_STATUS`](privileges-provided.md#priv_flush-status) or
  [`RELOAD`](privileges-provided.md#priv_reload) privilege.
- [`FLUSH USER_RESOURCES`](flush.md#flush-user-resources)

  Resets all per-hour user resource indicators to zero.

  This operation requires the
  [`FLUSH_USER_RESOURCES`](privileges-provided.md#priv_flush-user-resources) or
  [`RELOAD`](privileges-provided.md#priv_reload) privilege.

  Resetting resource indicators enables clients that have
  reached their hourly connection, query, or update limits to
  resume activity immediately. [`FLUSH
  USER_RESOURCES`](flush.md#flush-user-resources) does not apply to the limit on
  maximum simultaneous connections that is controlled by the
  [`max_user_connections`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_max_user_connections) system
  variable. See [Section 8.2.21, “Setting Account Resource Limits”](user-resources.md "8.2.21 Setting Account Resource Limits").

##### FLUSH TABLES Syntax

[`FLUSH TABLES`](flush.md#flush-tables) flushes tables, and,
depending on the variant used, acquires locks. Any
`TABLES` variant used in a
[`FLUSH`](flush.md "15.7.8.3 FLUSH Statement") statement must be the only
option used. [`FLUSH
TABLE`](flush.md#flush-tables) is a synonym for [`FLUSH
TABLES`](flush.md#flush-tables).

Note

The descriptions here that indicate tables are flushed by
closing them apply differently for `InnoDB`,
which flushes table contents to disk but leaves them open.
This still permits table files to be copied while the tables
are open, as long as other activity does not modify them.

- [`FLUSH TABLES`](flush.md#flush-tables)

  Closes all open tables, forces all tables in use to be
  closed, and flushes the prepared statement cache.

  This operation requires the
  [`FLUSH_TABLES`](privileges-provided.md#priv_flush-tables) or
  [`RELOAD`](privileges-provided.md#priv_reload) privilege.

  For information about prepared statement caching, see
  [Section 10.10.3, “Caching of Prepared Statements and Stored Programs”](statement-caching.md "10.10.3 Caching of Prepared Statements and Stored Programs").

  [`FLUSH TABLES`](flush.md#flush-tables) is not permitted
  when there is an active
  [`LOCK TABLES ...
  READ`](lock-tables.md "15.3.6 LOCK TABLES and UNLOCK TABLES Statements"). To flush and lock tables, use
  [`FLUSH
  TABLES tbl_name ... WITH READ
  LOCK`](flush.md#flush-tables-with-read-lock-with-list) instead.
- [`FLUSH
  TABLES tbl_name [,
  tbl_name] ...`](flush.md#flush-tables-with-list)

  With a list of one or more comma-separated table names, this
  operation is like [`FLUSH
  TABLES`](flush.md#flush-tables) with no names except that the server
  flushes only the named tables. If a named table does not
  exist, no error occurs.

  This operation requires the
  [`FLUSH_TABLES`](privileges-provided.md#priv_flush-tables) or
  [`RELOAD`](privileges-provided.md#priv_reload) privilege.
- [`FLUSH
  TABLES WITH READ LOCK`](flush.md#flush-tables-with-read-lock)

  Closes all open tables and locks all tables for all
  databases with a global read lock.

  This operation requires the
  [`FLUSH_TABLES`](privileges-provided.md#priv_flush-tables) or
  [`RELOAD`](privileges-provided.md#priv_reload) privilege.

  This operation is a very convenient way to get backups if
  you have a file system such as Veritas or ZFS that can take
  snapshots in time. Use
  [`UNLOCK
  TABLES`](lock-tables.md "15.3.6 LOCK TABLES and UNLOCK TABLES Statements") to release the lock.

  [`FLUSH TABLES WITH READ LOCK`](flush.md#flush-tables-with-read-lock)
  acquires a global read lock rather than table locks, so it
  is not subject to the same behavior as
  [`LOCK TABLES`](lock-tables.md "15.3.6 LOCK TABLES and UNLOCK TABLES Statements") and
  [`UNLOCK
  TABLES`](lock-tables.md "15.3.6 LOCK TABLES and UNLOCK TABLES Statements") with respect to table locking and implicit
  commits:

  - [`UNLOCK
    TABLES`](lock-tables.md "15.3.6 LOCK TABLES and UNLOCK TABLES Statements") implicitly commits any active
    transaction only if any tables currently have been
    locked with [`LOCK TABLES`](lock-tables.md "15.3.6 LOCK TABLES and UNLOCK TABLES Statements").
    The commit does not occur for
    [`UNLOCK
    TABLES`](lock-tables.md "15.3.6 LOCK TABLES and UNLOCK TABLES Statements") following [`FLUSH
    TABLES WITH READ LOCK`](flush.md#flush-tables-with-read-lock) because the latter
    statement does not acquire table locks.
  - Beginning a transaction causes table locks acquired with
    [`LOCK TABLES`](lock-tables.md "15.3.6 LOCK TABLES and UNLOCK TABLES Statements") to be
    released, as though you had executed
    [`UNLOCK
    TABLES`](lock-tables.md "15.3.6 LOCK TABLES and UNLOCK TABLES Statements"). Beginning a transaction does not
    release a global read lock acquired with
    [`FLUSH TABLES WITH READ
    LOCK`](flush.md#flush-tables-with-read-lock).

  [`FLUSH TABLES WITH READ LOCK`](flush.md#flush-tables-with-read-lock)
  does not prevent the server from inserting rows into the log
  tables (see [Section 7.4.1, “Selecting General Query Log and Slow Query Log Output Destinations”](log-destinations.md "7.4.1 Selecting General Query Log and Slow Query Log Output Destinations")).
- [`FLUSH
  TABLES tbl_name [,
  tbl_name] ... WITH READ
  LOCK`](flush.md#flush-tables-with-read-lock-with-list)

  Flushes and acquires read locks for the named tables.

  This operation requires the
  [`FLUSH_TABLES`](privileges-provided.md#priv_flush-tables) or
  [`RELOAD`](privileges-provided.md#priv_reload) privilege. Because it
  acquires table locks, it also requires the
  [`LOCK TABLES`](privileges-provided.md#priv_lock-tables) privilege for
  each table.

  The operation first acquires exclusive metadata locks for
  the tables, so it waits for transactions that have those
  tables open to complete. Then the operation flushes the
  tables from the table cache, reopens the tables, acquires
  table locks (like
  [`LOCK TABLES ...
  READ`](lock-tables.md "15.3.6 LOCK TABLES and UNLOCK TABLES Statements")), and downgrades the metadata locks from
  exclusive to shared. After the operation acquires locks and
  downgrades the metadata locks, other sessions can read but
  not modify the tables.

  This operation applies only to existing base
  (non-`TEMPORARY)` tables. If a name refers
  to a base table, that table is used. If it refers to a
  `TEMPORARY` table, it is ignored. If a name
  applies to a view, an
  [`ER_WRONG_OBJECT`](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/mysql-errors/8.0/en/server-error-reference.html#error_er_wrong_object) error
  occurs. Otherwise, an
  [`ER_NO_SUCH_TABLE`](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/mysql-errors/8.0/en/server-error-reference.html#error_er_no_such_table) error
  occurs.

  Use [`UNLOCK
  TABLES`](lock-tables.md "15.3.6 LOCK TABLES and UNLOCK TABLES Statements") to release the locks,
  [`LOCK TABLES`](lock-tables.md "15.3.6 LOCK TABLES and UNLOCK TABLES Statements") to release the
  locks and acquire other locks, or
  [`START
  TRANSACTION`](commit.md "15.3.1 START TRANSACTION, COMMIT, and ROLLBACK Statements") to release the locks and begin a new
  transaction.

  This [`FLUSH TABLES`](flush.md#flush-tables) variant
  enables tables to be flushed and locked in a single
  operation. It provides a workaround for the restriction that
  [`FLUSH TABLES`](flush.md#flush-tables) is not permitted
  when there is an active
  [`LOCK TABLES ...
  READ`](lock-tables.md "15.3.6 LOCK TABLES and UNLOCK TABLES Statements").

  This operation does not perform an implicit
  [`UNLOCK
  TABLES`](lock-tables.md "15.3.6 LOCK TABLES and UNLOCK TABLES Statements"), so an error results if you perform the
  operation while there is any active
  [`LOCK TABLES`](lock-tables.md "15.3.6 LOCK TABLES and UNLOCK TABLES Statements") or use it a
  second time without first releasing the locks acquired.

  If a flushed table was opened with
  [`HANDLER`](handler.md "15.2.5 HANDLER Statement"), the handler is
  implicitly flushed and loses its position.
- [`FLUSH
  TABLES tbl_name [,
  tbl_name] ... FOR
  EXPORT`](flush.md#flush-tables-for-export-with-list)

  This [`FLUSH TABLES`](flush.md#flush-tables) variant
  applies to `InnoDB` tables. It ensures that
  changes to the named tables have been flushed to disk so
  that binary table copies can be made while the server is
  running.

  This operation requires the
  [`FLUSH_TABLES`](privileges-provided.md#priv_flush-tables) or
  [`RELOAD`](privileges-provided.md#priv_reload) privilege. Because it
  acquires locks on tables in preparation for exporting them,
  it also requires the [`LOCK
  TABLES`](privileges-provided.md#priv_lock-tables) and [`SELECT`](privileges-provided.md#priv_select)
  privileges for each table.

  The operation works like this:

  1. It acquires shared metadata locks for the named tables.
     The operation blocks as long as other sessions have
     active transactions that have modified those tables or
     hold table locks for them. When the locks have been
     acquired, the operation blocks transactions that attempt
     to update the tables, while permitting read-only
     operations to continue.
  2. It checks whether all storage engines for the tables
     support `FOR EXPORT`. If any do not, an
     [`ER_ILLEGAL_HA`](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/mysql-errors/8.0/en/server-error-reference.html#error_er_illegal_ha) error
     occurs and the operation fails.
  3. The operation notifies the storage engine for each table
     to make the table ready for export. The storage engine
     must ensure that any pending changes are written to
     disk.
  4. The operation puts the session in lock-tables mode so
     that the metadata locks acquired earlier are not
     released when the `FOR EXPORT`
     operation completes.

  This operation applies only to existing base
  (non-`TEMPORARY`) tables. If a name refers
  to a base table, that table is used. If it refers to a
  `TEMPORARY` table, it is ignored. If a name
  applies to a view, an
  [`ER_WRONG_OBJECT`](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/mysql-errors/8.0/en/server-error-reference.html#error_er_wrong_object) error
  occurs. Otherwise, an
  [`ER_NO_SUCH_TABLE`](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/mysql-errors/8.0/en/server-error-reference.html#error_er_no_such_table) error
  occurs.

  `InnoDB` supports `FOR
  EXPORT` for tables that have their own
  [`.ibd`
  file](glossary.md#glos_ibd_file ".ibd file") file (that is, tables created with the
  [`innodb_file_per_table`](innodb-parameters.md#sysvar_innodb_file_per_table)
  setting enabled). `InnoDB` ensures when
  notified by the `FOR EXPORT` operation that
  any changes have been flushed to disk. This permits a binary
  copy of table contents to be made while the `FOR
  EXPORT` operation is in effect because the
  `.ibd` file is transaction consistent and
  can be copied while the server is running. `FOR
  EXPORT` does not apply to `InnoDB`
  system tablespace files, or to `InnoDB`
  tables that have `FULLTEXT` indexes.

  [`FLUSH
  TABLES ...FOR EXPORT`](flush.md#flush-tables-for-export-with-list) is supported for partitioned
  `InnoDB` tables.

  When notified by `FOR EXPORT`,
  `InnoDB` writes to disk certain kinds of
  data that is normally held in memory or in separate disk
  buffers outside the tablespace files. For each table,
  `InnoDB` also produces a file named
  `table_name.cfg`
  in the same database directory as the table. The
  `.cfg` file contains metadata needed to
  reimport the tablespace files later, into the same or
  different server.

  When the `FOR EXPORT` operation completes,
  `InnoDB` has flushed all
  [dirty pages](glossary.md#glos_dirty_page "dirty page") to the
  table data files. Any
  [change buffer](glossary.md#glos_change_buffer "change buffer")
  entries are merged prior to flushing. At this point, the
  tables are locked and quiescent: The tables are in a
  transactionally consistent state on disk and you can copy
  the `.ibd` tablespace files along with
  the corresponding `.cfg` files to get a
  consistent snapshot of those tables.

  For the procedure to reimport the copied table data into a
  MySQL instance, see [Section 17.6.1.3, “Importing InnoDB Tables”](innodb-table-import.md "17.6.1.3 Importing InnoDB Tables").

  After you are done with the tables, use
  [`UNLOCK
  TABLES`](lock-tables.md "15.3.6 LOCK TABLES and UNLOCK TABLES Statements") to release the locks,
  [`LOCK TABLES`](lock-tables.md "15.3.6 LOCK TABLES and UNLOCK TABLES Statements") to release the
  locks and acquire other locks, or
  [`START
  TRANSACTION`](commit.md "15.3.1 START TRANSACTION, COMMIT, and ROLLBACK Statements") to release the locks and begin a new
  transaction.

  While any of these statements is in effect within the
  session, attempts to use
  [`FLUSH
  TABLES ... FOR EXPORT`](flush.md#flush-tables-for-export-with-list) produce an error:

  ```sql
  FLUSH TABLES ... WITH READ LOCK
  FLUSH TABLES ... FOR EXPORT
  LOCK TABLES ... READ
  LOCK TABLES ... WRITE
  ```

  While
  [`FLUSH
  TABLES ... FOR EXPORT`](flush.md#flush-tables-for-export-with-list) is in effect within the
  session, attempts to use any of these statements produce an
  error:

  ```sql
  FLUSH TABLES WITH READ LOCK
  FLUSH TABLES ... WITH READ LOCK
  FLUSH TABLES ... FOR EXPORT
  ```
