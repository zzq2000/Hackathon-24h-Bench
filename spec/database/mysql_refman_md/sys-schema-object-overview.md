#### 30.4.3.26 The schema\_object\_overview View

This view summarizes the types of objects within each schema.
By default, rows are sorted by schema and object type.

Note

For MySQL instances with a large number of objects, this
view might take a long time to execute.

has these columns:

- `db`

  The schema name.
- `object_type`

  The object type: `BASE TABLE`,
  `INDEX
  (index_type)`,
  `EVENT`, `FUNCTION`,
  `PROCEDURE`, `TRIGGER`,
  `VIEW`.
- `count`

  The number of objects in the schema of the given type.
