### 7.1.19 The Server Shutdown Process

The server shutdown process takes place as follows:

1. The shutdown process is initiated.

   This can occur initiated several ways. For example, a user
   with the [`SHUTDOWN`](privileges-provided.md#priv_shutdown) privilege can
   execute a [**mysqladmin shutdown**](mysqladmin.md "6.5.2 mysqladmin — A MySQL Server Administration Program") command.
   [**mysqladmin**](mysqladmin.md "6.5.2 mysqladmin — A MySQL Server Administration Program") can be used on any platform
   supported by MySQL. Other operating system-specific shutdown
   initiation methods are possible as well: The server shuts down
   on Unix when it receives a `SIGTERM` signal.
   A server running as a service on Windows shuts down when the
   services manager tells it to.
2. The server creates a shutdown thread if necessary.

   Depending on how shutdown was initiated, the server might
   create a thread to handle the shutdown process. If shutdown
   was requested by a client, a shutdown thread is created. If
   shutdown is the result of receiving a
   `SIGTERM` signal, the signal thread might
   handle shutdown itself, or it might create a separate thread
   to do so. If the server tries to create a shutdown thread and
   cannot (for example, if memory is exhausted), it issues a
   diagnostic message that appears in the error log:

   ```simple
   Error: Can't create thread to kill server
   ```
3. The server stops accepting new connections.

   To prevent new activity from being initiated during shutdown,
   the server stops accepting new client connections by closing
   the handlers for the network interfaces to which it normally
   listens for connections: the TCP/IP port, the Unix socket
   file, the Windows named pipe, and shared memory on Windows.
4. The server terminates current activity.

   For each thread associated with a client connection, the
   server breaks the connection to the client and marks the
   thread as killed. Threads die when they notice that they are
   so marked. Threads for idle connections die quickly. Threads
   that currently are processing statements check their state
   periodically and take longer to die. For additional
   information about thread termination, see
   [Section 15.7.8.4, “KILL Statement”](kill.md "15.7.8.4 KILL Statement"), in particular for the instructions
   about killed [`REPAIR TABLE`](repair-table.md "15.7.3.5 REPAIR TABLE Statement") or
   [`OPTIMIZE TABLE`](optimize-table.md "15.7.3.4 OPTIMIZE TABLE Statement") operations on
   `MyISAM` tables.

   For threads that have an open transaction, the transaction is
   rolled back. If a thread is updating a nontransactional table,
   an operation such as a multiple-row
   [`UPDATE`](update.md "15.2.17 UPDATE Statement") or
   [`INSERT`](insert.md "15.2.7 INSERT Statement") may leave the table
   partially updated because the operation can terminate before
   completion.

   If the server is a replication source server, it treats
   threads associated with currently connected replicas like
   other client threads. That is, each one is marked as killed
   and exits when it next checks its state.

   If the server is a replica server, it stops the replication
   I/O and SQL threads, if they are active, before marking client
   threads as killed. The SQL thread is permitted to finish its
   current statement (to avoid causing replication problems), and
   then stops. If the SQL thread is in the middle of a
   transaction at this point, the server waits until the current
   replication event group (if any) has finished executing, or
   until the user issues a
   [`KILL QUERY`](kill.md "15.7.8.4 KILL Statement") or
   [`KILL
   CONNECTION`](kill.md "15.7.8.4 KILL Statement") statement. See also
   [Section 15.4.2.9, “STOP SLAVE Statement”](stop-slave.md "15.4.2.9 STOP SLAVE Statement"). Since nontransactional
   statements cannot be rolled back, in order to guarantee
   crash-safe replication, only transactional tables should be
   used.

   Note

   To guarantee crash safety on the replica, you must run the
   replica with
   [`--relay-log-recovery`](replication-options-replica.md#sysvar_relay_log_recovery) enabled.

   See also [Section 19.2.4, “Relay Log and Replication Metadata Repositories”](replica-logs.md "19.2.4 Relay Log and Replication Metadata Repositories")).
5. The server shuts down or closes storage engines.

   At this stage, the server flushes the table cache and closes
   all open tables.

   Each storage engine performs any actions necessary for tables
   that it manages.
   `InnoDB` flushes its buffer pool to disk
   (unless [`innodb_fast_shutdown`](innodb-parameters.md#sysvar_innodb_fast_shutdown)
   is 2), writes the current LSN to the tablespace, and
   terminates its own internal threads. `MyISAM`
   flushes any pending index writes for a table.
6. The server exits.

To provide information to management processes, the server returns
one of the exit codes described in the following list. The phrase
in parentheses indicates the action taken by systemd in response
to the code, for platforms on which systemd is used to manage the
server.

- 0 = successful termination (no restart done)
- 1 = unsuccessful termination (no restart done)
- 2 = unsuccessful termination (restart done)
