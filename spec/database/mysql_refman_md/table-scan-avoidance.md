#### 10.2.1.23 Avoiding Full Table Scans

The output from [`EXPLAIN`](explain.md "15.8.2 EXPLAIN Statement") shows
[`ALL`](explain-output.md#jointype_all) in the
`type` column when MySQL uses a
[full table scan](glossary.md#glos_full_table_scan "full table scan") to
resolve a query. This usually happens under the following
conditions:

- The table is so small that it is faster to perform a table
  scan than to bother with a key lookup. This is common for
  tables with fewer than 10 rows and a short row length.
- There are no usable restrictions in the
  `ON` or `WHERE` clause
  for indexed columns.
- You are comparing indexed columns with constant values and
  MySQL has calculated (based on the index tree) that the
  constants cover too large a part of the table and that a
  table scan would be faster. See
  [Section 10.2.1.1, “WHERE Clause Optimization”](where-optimization.md "10.2.1.1 WHERE Clause Optimization").
- You are using a key with low cardinality (many rows match
  the key value) through another column. In this case, MySQL
  assumes that by using the key probably requires many key
  lookups and that a table scan would be faster.

For small tables, a table scan often is appropriate and the
performance impact is negligible. For large tables, try the
following techniques to avoid having the optimizer incorrectly
choose a table scan:

- Use `ANALYZE TABLE
  tbl_name` to update
  the key distributions for the scanned table. See
  [Section 15.7.3.1, “ANALYZE TABLE Statement”](analyze-table.md "15.7.3.1 ANALYZE TABLE Statement").
- Use `FORCE INDEX` for the scanned table
  to tell MySQL that table scans are very expensive compared
  to using the given index:

  ```sql
  SELECT * FROM t1, t2 FORCE INDEX (index_for_column)
    WHERE t1.col_name=t2.col_name;
  ```

  See [Section 10.9.4, “Index Hints”](index-hints.md "10.9.4 Index Hints").
- Start [**mysqld**](mysqld.md "6.3.1 mysqld — The MySQL Server") with the
  [`--max-seeks-for-key=1000`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_max_seeks_for_key)
  option or use `SET
  max_seeks_for_key=1000` to tell the optimizer to
  assume that no key scan causes more than 1,000 key seeks.
