### 17.12.3 Online DDL Space Requirements

Disk space requirements for online DDL operations are outlined
below. The requirements do not apply to operations that are
performed instantly.

- Temporary log files:

  A temporary log file records concurrent DML when an online DDL
  operation creates an index or alters a table. The temporary
  log file is extended as required by the value of
  [`innodb_sort_buffer_size`](innodb-parameters.md#sysvar_innodb_sort_buffer_size) up to
  a maximum specified by
  [`innodb_online_alter_log_max_size`](innodb-parameters.md#sysvar_innodb_online_alter_log_max_size).
  If the operation takes a long time and concurrent DML modifies
  the table so much that the size of the temporary log file
  exceeds the value of
  [`innodb_online_alter_log_max_size`](innodb-parameters.md#sysvar_innodb_online_alter_log_max_size),
  the online DDL operation fails with a
  `DB_ONLINE_LOG_TOO_BIG` error, and
  uncommitted concurrent DML operations are rolled back. A large
  [`innodb_online_alter_log_max_size`](innodb-parameters.md#sysvar_innodb_online_alter_log_max_size)
  setting permits more DML during an online DDL operation, but
  it also extends the period of time at the end of the DDL
  operation when the table is locked to apply logged DML.

  The [`innodb_sort_buffer_size`](innodb-parameters.md#sysvar_innodb_sort_buffer_size)
  variable also defines the size of the temporary log file read
  buffer and write buffer.
- Temporary sort files:

  Online DDL operations that rebuild the table write temporary
  sort files to the MySQL temporary directory
  (`$TMPDIR` on Unix, `%TEMP%`
  on Windows, or the directory specified by
  [`--tmpdir`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_tmpdir)) during index
  creation. Temporary sort files are not created in the
  directory that contains the original table. Each temporary
  sort file is large enough to hold one column of data, and each
  sort file is removed when its data is merged into the final
  table or index. Operations involving temporary sort files may
  require temporary space equal to the amount of data in the
  table plus indexes. An error is reported if online DDL
  operation uses all of the available disk space on the file
  system where the data directory resides.

  If the MySQL temporary directory is not large enough to hold
  the sort files, set [`tmpdir`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_tmpdir) to
  a different directory. Alternatively, define a separate
  temporary directory for online DDL operations using
  [`innodb_tmpdir`](innodb-parameters.md#sysvar_innodb_tmpdir). This option
  was introduced to help avoid temporary directory overflows
  that could occur as a result of large temporary sort files.
- Intermediate table files:

  Some online DDL operations that rebuild the table create a
  temporary intermediate table file in the same directory as the
  original table. An intermediate table file may require space
  equal to the size of the original table. Intermediate table
  file names begin with `#sql-ib` prefix and
  only appear briefly during the online DDL operation.

  The [`innodb_tmpdir`](innodb-parameters.md#sysvar_innodb_tmpdir) option is
  not applicable to intermediate table files.
