### 15.2.5 HANDLER Statement

```sql
HANDLER tbl_name OPEN [ [AS] alias]

HANDLER tbl_name READ index_name { = | <= | >= | < | > } (value1,value2,...)
    [ WHERE where_condition ] [LIMIT ... ]
HANDLER tbl_name READ index_name { FIRST | NEXT | PREV | LAST }
    [ WHERE where_condition ] [LIMIT ... ]
HANDLER tbl_name READ { FIRST | NEXT }
    [ WHERE where_condition ] [LIMIT ... ]

HANDLER tbl_name CLOSE
```

The `HANDLER` statement provides direct access to
table storage engine interfaces. It is available for
`InnoDB` and `MyISAM` tables.

The `HANDLER ... OPEN` statement opens a table,
making it accessible using subsequent `HANDLER ...
READ` statements. This table object is not shared by
other sessions and is not closed until the session calls
`HANDLER ... CLOSE` or the session terminates.

If you open the table using an alias, further references to the
open table with other `HANDLER` statements must
use the alias rather than the table name. If you do not use an
alias, but open the table using a table name qualified by the
database name, further references must use the unqualified table
name. For example, for a table opened using
`mydb.mytable`, further references must use
`mytable`.

The first `HANDLER ... READ` syntax fetches a row
where the index specified satisfies the given values and the
`WHERE` condition is met. If you have a
multiple-column index, specify the index column values as a
comma-separated list. Either specify values for all the columns in
the index, or specify values for a leftmost prefix of the index
columns. Suppose that an index `my_idx` includes
three columns named `col_a`,
`col_b`, and `col_c`, in that
order. The `HANDLER` statement can specify values
for all three columns in the index, or for the columns in a
leftmost prefix. For example:

```sql
HANDLER ... READ my_idx = (col_a_val,col_b_val,col_c_val) ...
HANDLER ... READ my_idx = (col_a_val,col_b_val) ...
HANDLER ... READ my_idx = (col_a_val) ...
```

To employ the `HANDLER` interface to refer to a
table's `PRIMARY KEY`, use the quoted identifier
`` `PRIMARY` ``:

```sql
HANDLER tbl_name READ `PRIMARY` ...
```

The second `HANDLER ... READ` syntax fetches a
row from the table in index order that matches the
`WHERE` condition.

The third `HANDLER ... READ` syntax fetches a row
from the table in natural row order that matches the
`WHERE` condition. It is faster than
`HANDLER tbl_name READ
index_name` when a full table
scan is desired. Natural row order is the order in which rows are
stored in a `MyISAM` table data file. This
statement works for `InnoDB` tables as well, but
there is no such concept because there is no separate data file.

Without a `LIMIT` clause, all forms of
`HANDLER ... READ` fetch a single row if one is
available. To return a specific number of rows, include a
`LIMIT` clause. It has the same syntax as for the
[`SELECT`](select.md "15.2.13 SELECT Statement") statement. See
[Section 15.2.13, “SELECT Statement”](select.md "15.2.13 SELECT Statement").

`HANDLER ... CLOSE` closes a table that was
opened with `HANDLER ... OPEN`.

There are several reasons to use the `HANDLER`
interface instead of normal [`SELECT`](select.md "15.2.13 SELECT Statement")
statements:

- `HANDLER` is faster than
  [`SELECT`](select.md "15.2.13 SELECT Statement"):

  - A designated storage engine handler object is allocated
    for the `HANDLER ... OPEN`. The object is
    reused for subsequent `HANDLER`
    statements for that table; it need not be reinitialized
    for each one.
  - There is less parsing involved.
  - There is no optimizer or query-checking overhead.
  - The handler interface does not have to provide a
    consistent look of the data (for example,
    [dirty reads](glossary.md#glos_dirty_read "dirty read") are
    permitted), so the storage engine can use optimizations
    that [`SELECT`](select.md "15.2.13 SELECT Statement") does not
    normally permit.
- `HANDLER` makes it easier to port to MySQL
  applications that use a low-level `ISAM`-like
  interface. (See [Section 17.20, “InnoDB memcached Plugin”](innodb-memcached.md "17.20 InnoDB memcached Plugin") for an
  alternative way to adapt applications that use the key-value
  store paradigm.)
- `HANDLER` enables you to traverse a database
  in a manner that is difficult (or even impossible) to
  accomplish with [`SELECT`](select.md "15.2.13 SELECT Statement"). The
  `HANDLER` interface is a more natural way to
  look at data when working with applications that provide an
  interactive user interface to the database.

`HANDLER` is a somewhat low-level statement. For
example, it does not provide consistency. That is,
`HANDLER ... OPEN` does *not*
take a snapshot of the table, and does *not*
lock the table. This means that after a `HANDLER ...
OPEN` statement is issued, table data can be modified (by
the current session or other sessions) and these modifications
might be only partially visible to `HANDLER ...
NEXT` or `HANDLER ... PREV` scans.

An open handler can be closed and marked for reopen, in which case
the handler loses its position in the table. This occurs when both
of the following circumstances are true:

- Any session executes [`FLUSH
  TABLES`](flush.md#flush-tables) or DDL statements on the handler's table.
- The session in which the handler is open executes
  non-`HANDLER` statements that use tables.

[`TRUNCATE TABLE`](truncate-table.md "15.1.37 TRUNCATE TABLE Statement") for a table closes
all handlers for the table that were opened with
[`HANDLER OPEN`](handler.md "15.2.5 HANDLER Statement").

If a table is flushed with
[`FLUSH
TABLES tbl_name WITH READ
LOCK`](flush.md#flush-tables-with-read-lock-with-list) was opened with `HANDLER`, the
handler is implicitly flushed and loses its position.
