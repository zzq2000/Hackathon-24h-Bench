### 8.2.10 Using Roles

A MySQL role is a named collection of privileges. Like user
accounts, roles can have privileges granted to and revoked from
them.

A user account can be granted roles, which grants to the account
the privileges associated with each role. This enables assignment
of sets of privileges to accounts and provides a convenient
alternative to granting individual privileges, both for
conceptualizing desired privilege assignments and implementing
them.

The following list summarizes role-management capabilities
provided by MySQL:

- [`CREATE ROLE`](create-role.md "15.7.1.2 CREATE ROLE Statement") and
  [`DROP ROLE`](drop-role.md "15.7.1.4 DROP ROLE Statement") create and remove
  roles.
- [`GRANT`](grant.md "15.7.1.6 GRANT Statement") and
  [`REVOKE`](revoke.md "15.7.1.8 REVOKE Statement") assign privileges to
  revoke privileges from user accounts and roles.
- [`SHOW GRANTS`](show-grants.md "15.7.7.21 SHOW GRANTS Statement") displays privilege
  and role assignments for user accounts and roles.
- [`SET DEFAULT ROLE`](set-default-role.md "15.7.1.9 SET DEFAULT ROLE Statement") specifies
  which account roles are active by default.
- [`SET ROLE`](set-role.md "15.7.1.11 SET ROLE Statement") changes the active
  roles within the current session.
- The [`CURRENT_ROLE()`](information-functions.md#function_current-role) function
  displays the active roles within the current session.
- The [`mandatory_roles`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_mandatory_roles) and
  [`activate_all_roles_on_login`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_activate_all_roles_on_login)
  system variables enable defining mandatory roles and automatic
  activation of granted roles when users log in to the server.

For descriptions of individual role-manipulation statements
(including the privileges required to use them), see
[Section 15.7.1, “Account Management Statements”](account-management-statements.md "15.7.1 Account Management Statements"). The following
discussion provides examples of role usage. Unless otherwise
specified, SQL statements shown here should be executed using a
MySQL account with sufficient administrative privileges, such as
the `root` account.

#### Creating Roles and Granting Privileges to Them

Consider this scenario:

- An application uses a database named
  `app_db`.
- Associated with the application, there can be accounts for
  developers who create and maintain the application, and for
  users who interact with it.
- Developers need full access to the database. Some users need
  only read access, others need read/write access.

To avoid granting privileges individually to possibly many user
accounts, create roles as names for the required privilege sets.
This makes it easy to grant the required privileges to user
accounts, by granting the appropriate roles.

To create the roles, use the [`CREATE
ROLE`](create-role.md "15.7.1.2 CREATE ROLE Statement") statement:

```sql
CREATE ROLE 'app_developer', 'app_read', 'app_write';
```

Role names are much like user account names and consist of a
user part and host part in
`'user_name'@'host_name'`
format. The host part, if omitted, defaults to
`'%'`. The user and host parts can be unquoted
unless they contain special characters such as
`-` or `%`. Unlike account
names, the user part of role names cannot be blank. For
additional information, see [Section 8.2.5, “Specifying Role Names”](role-names.md "8.2.5 Specifying Role Names").

To assign privileges to the roles, execute
[`GRANT`](grant.md "15.7.1.6 GRANT Statement") statements using the same
syntax as for assigning privileges to user accounts:

```sql
GRANT ALL ON app_db.* TO 'app_developer';
GRANT SELECT ON app_db.* TO 'app_read';
GRANT INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE ON app_db.* TO 'app_write';
```

Now suppose that initially you require one developer account,
two user accounts that need read-only access, and one user
account that needs read/write access. Use
[`CREATE USER`](create-user.md "15.7.1.3 CREATE USER Statement") to create the
accounts:

```sql
CREATE USER 'dev1'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'dev1pass';
CREATE USER 'read_user1'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'read_user1pass';
CREATE USER 'read_user2'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'read_user2pass';
CREATE USER 'rw_user1'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'rw_user1pass';
```

To assign each user account its required privileges, you could
use [`GRANT`](grant.md "15.7.1.6 GRANT Statement") statements of the same
form as just shown, but that requires enumerating individual
privileges for each user. Instead, use an alternative
[`GRANT`](grant.md "15.7.1.6 GRANT Statement") syntax that permits
granting roles rather than privileges:

```sql
GRANT 'app_developer' TO 'dev1'@'localhost';
GRANT 'app_read' TO 'read_user1'@'localhost', 'read_user2'@'localhost';
GRANT 'app_read', 'app_write' TO 'rw_user1'@'localhost';
```

The [`GRANT`](grant.md "15.7.1.6 GRANT Statement") statement for the
`rw_user1` account grants the read and write
roles, which combine to provide the required read and write
privileges.

The [`GRANT`](grant.md "15.7.1.6 GRANT Statement") syntax for granting
roles to an account differs from the syntax for granting
privileges: There is an `ON` clause to assign
privileges, whereas there is no `ON` clause to
assign roles. Because the syntaxes are distinct, you cannot mix
assigning privileges and roles in the same statement. (It is
permitted to assign both privileges and roles to an account, but
you must use separate [`GRANT`](grant.md "15.7.1.6 GRANT Statement")
statements, each with syntax appropriate to what is to be
granted.) As of MySQL 8.0.16, roles cannot be granted to
anonymous users.

A role when created is locked, has no password, and is assigned
the default authentication plugin. (These role attributes can be
changed later with the [`ALTER USER`](alter-user.md "15.7.1.1 ALTER USER Statement")
statement, by users who have the global
[`CREATE USER`](privileges-provided.md#priv_create-user) privilege.)

While locked, a role cannot be used to authenticate to the
server. If unlocked, a role can be used to authenticate. This is
because roles and users are both authorization identifiers with
much in common and little to distinguish them. See also
[User and Role Interchangeability](roles.md#role-user-interchangeability "User and Role Interchangeability").

#### Defining Mandatory Roles

It is possible to specify roles as mandatory by naming them in
the value of the
[`mandatory_roles`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_mandatory_roles) system
variable. The server treats a mandatory role as granted to all
users, so that it need not be granted explicitly to any account.

To specify mandatory roles at server startup, define
[`mandatory_roles`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_mandatory_roles) in your server
`my.cnf` file:

```ini
[mysqld]
mandatory_roles='role1,role2@localhost,r3@%.example.com'
```

To set and persist
[`mandatory_roles`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_mandatory_roles) at runtime, use
a statement like this:

```sql
SET PERSIST mandatory_roles = 'role1,role2@localhost,r3@%.example.com';
```

[`SET
PERSIST`](set-variable.md "15.7.6.1 SET Syntax for Variable Assignment") sets a value for the running MySQL instance.
It also saves the value, causing it to carry over to subsequent
server restarts. To change the value for the running MySQL
instance without having it carry over to subsequent restarts,
use the `GLOBAL` keyword rather than
`PERSIST`. See [Section 15.7.6.1, “SET Syntax for Variable Assignment”](set-variable.md "15.7.6.1 SET Syntax for Variable Assignment").

Setting [`mandatory_roles`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_mandatory_roles)
requires the [`ROLE_ADMIN`](privileges-provided.md#priv_role-admin)
privilege, in addition to the
[`SYSTEM_VARIABLES_ADMIN`](privileges-provided.md#priv_system-variables-admin) privilege
(or the deprecated [`SUPER`](privileges-provided.md#priv_super)
privilege) normally required to set a global system variable.

Mandatory roles, like explicitly granted roles, do not take
effect until activated (see [Activating Roles](roles.md#roles-activating "Activating Roles")).
At login time, role activation occurs for all granted roles if
the [`activate_all_roles_on_login`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_activate_all_roles_on_login)
system variable is enabled, or for roles that are set as default
roles otherwise. At runtime, [`SET
ROLE`](set-role.md "15.7.1.11 SET ROLE Statement") activates roles.

Roles named in the value of
[`mandatory_roles`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_mandatory_roles) cannot be
revoked with [`REVOKE`](revoke.md "15.7.1.8 REVOKE Statement") or dropped
with [`DROP ROLE`](drop-role.md "15.7.1.4 DROP ROLE Statement") or
[`DROP USER`](drop-user.md "15.7.1.5 DROP USER Statement").

To prevent sessions from being made system sessions by default,
a role that has the [`SYSTEM_USER`](privileges-provided.md#priv_system-user)
privilege cannot be listed in the value of the
[`mandatory_roles`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_mandatory_roles) system
variable:

- If [`mandatory_roles`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_mandatory_roles) is
  assigned a role at startup that has the
  [`SYSTEM_USER`](privileges-provided.md#priv_system-user) privilege, the
  server writes a message to the error log and exits.
- If [`mandatory_roles`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_mandatory_roles) is
  assigned a role at runtime that has the
  [`SYSTEM_USER`](privileges-provided.md#priv_system-user) privilege, an
  error occurs and the
  [`mandatory_roles`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_mandatory_roles) value
  remains unchanged.

Even with this safeguard, it is better to avoid granting the
[`SYSTEM_USER`](privileges-provided.md#priv_system-user) privilege through a
role in order to guard against the possibility of privilege
escalation.

If a role named in
[`mandatory_roles`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_mandatory_roles) is not present
in the `mysql.user` system table, the role is
not granted to users. When the server attempts role activation
for a user, it does not treat the nonexistent role as mandatory
and writes a warning to the error log. If the role is created
later and thus becomes valid, [`FLUSH
PRIVILEGES`](flush.md#flush-privileges) may be necessary to cause the server to
treat it as mandatory.

[`SHOW GRANTS`](show-grants.md "15.7.7.21 SHOW GRANTS Statement") displays mandatory
roles according to the rules described in
[Section 15.7.7.21, “SHOW GRANTS Statement”](show-grants.md "15.7.7.21 SHOW GRANTS Statement").

#### Checking Role Privileges

To verify the privileges assigned to an account, use
[`SHOW GRANTS`](show-grants.md "15.7.7.21 SHOW GRANTS Statement"). For example:

```sql
mysql> SHOW GRANTS FOR 'dev1'@'localhost';
+-------------------------------------------------+
| Grants for dev1@localhost                       |
+-------------------------------------------------+
| GRANT USAGE ON *.* TO `dev1`@`localhost`        |
| GRANT `app_developer`@`%` TO `dev1`@`localhost` |
+-------------------------------------------------+
```

However, that shows each granted role without
“expanding” it to the privileges the role
represents. To show role privileges as well, add a
`USING` clause naming the granted roles for
which to display privileges:

```sql
mysql> SHOW GRANTS FOR 'dev1'@'localhost' USING 'app_developer';
+----------------------------------------------------------+
| Grants for dev1@localhost                                |
+----------------------------------------------------------+
| GRANT USAGE ON *.* TO `dev1`@`localhost`                 |
| GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON `app_db`.* TO `dev1`@`localhost` |
| GRANT `app_developer`@`%` TO `dev1`@`localhost`          |
+----------------------------------------------------------+
```

Verify each other type of user similarly:

```sql
mysql> SHOW GRANTS FOR 'read_user1'@'localhost' USING 'app_read';
+--------------------------------------------------------+
| Grants for read_user1@localhost                        |
+--------------------------------------------------------+
| GRANT USAGE ON *.* TO `read_user1`@`localhost`         |
| GRANT SELECT ON `app_db`.* TO `read_user1`@`localhost` |
| GRANT `app_read`@`%` TO `read_user1`@`localhost`       |
+--------------------------------------------------------+
mysql> SHOW GRANTS FOR 'rw_user1'@'localhost' USING 'app_read', 'app_write';
+------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| Grants for rw_user1@localhost                                                |
+------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| GRANT USAGE ON *.* TO `rw_user1`@`localhost`                                 |
| GRANT SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE ON `app_db`.* TO `rw_user1`@`localhost` |
| GRANT `app_read`@`%`,`app_write`@`%` TO `rw_user1`@`localhost`               |
+------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
```

[`SHOW GRANTS`](show-grants.md "15.7.7.21 SHOW GRANTS Statement") displays mandatory
roles according to the rules described in
[Section 15.7.7.21, “SHOW GRANTS Statement”](show-grants.md "15.7.7.21 SHOW GRANTS Statement").

#### Activating Roles

Roles granted to a user account can be active or inactive within
account sessions. If a granted role is active within a session,
its privileges apply; otherwise, they do not. To determine which
roles are active within the current session, use the
[`CURRENT_ROLE()`](information-functions.md#function_current-role) function.

By default, granting a role to an account or naming it in the
[`mandatory_roles`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_mandatory_roles) system variable
value does not automatically cause the role to become active
within account sessions. For example, because thus far in the
preceding discussion no `rw_user1` roles have
been activated, if you connect to the server as
`rw_user1` and invoke the
[`CURRENT_ROLE()`](information-functions.md#function_current-role) function, the
result is `NONE` (no active roles):

```sql
mysql> SELECT CURRENT_ROLE();
+----------------+
| CURRENT_ROLE() |
+----------------+
| NONE           |
+----------------+
```

To specify which roles should become active each time a user
connects to the server and authenticates, use
[`SET DEFAULT ROLE`](set-default-role.md "15.7.1.9 SET DEFAULT ROLE Statement"). To set the
default to all assigned roles for each account created earlier,
use this statement:

```sql
SET DEFAULT ROLE ALL TO
  'dev1'@'localhost',
  'read_user1'@'localhost',
  'read_user2'@'localhost',
  'rw_user1'@'localhost';
```

Now if you connect as `rw_user1`, the initial
value of [`CURRENT_ROLE()`](information-functions.md#function_current-role) reflects
the new default role assignments:

```sql
mysql> SELECT CURRENT_ROLE();
+--------------------------------+
| CURRENT_ROLE()                 |
+--------------------------------+
| `app_read`@`%`,`app_write`@`%` |
+--------------------------------+
```

To cause all explicitly granted and mandatory roles to be
automatically activated when users connect to the server, enable
the [`activate_all_roles_on_login`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_activate_all_roles_on_login)
system variable. By default, automatic role activation is
disabled.

Within a session, a user can execute [`SET
ROLE`](set-role.md "15.7.1.11 SET ROLE Statement") to change the set of active roles. For example,
for `rw_user1`:

```sql
mysql> SET ROLE NONE; SELECT CURRENT_ROLE();
+----------------+
| CURRENT_ROLE() |
+----------------+
| NONE           |
+----------------+
mysql> SET ROLE ALL EXCEPT 'app_write'; SELECT CURRENT_ROLE();
+----------------+
| CURRENT_ROLE() |
+----------------+
| `app_read`@`%` |
+----------------+
mysql> SET ROLE DEFAULT; SELECT CURRENT_ROLE();
+--------------------------------+
| CURRENT_ROLE()                 |
+--------------------------------+
| `app_read`@`%`,`app_write`@`%` |
+--------------------------------+
```

The first [`SET ROLE`](set-role.md "15.7.1.11 SET ROLE Statement") statement
deactivates all roles. The second makes
`rw_user1` effectively read only. The third
restores the default roles.

The effective user for stored program and view objects is
subject to the `DEFINER` and `SQL
SECURITY` attributes, which determine whether execution
occurs in invoker or definer context (see
[Section 27.6, “Stored Object Access Control”](stored-objects-security.md "27.6 Stored Object Access Control")):

- Stored program and view objects that execute in invoker
  context execute with the roles that are active within the
  current session.
- Stored program and view objects that execute in definer
  context execute with the default roles of the user named in
  their `DEFINER` attribute. If
  [`activate_all_roles_on_login`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_activate_all_roles_on_login)
  is enabled, such objects execute with all roles granted to
  the `DEFINER` user, including mandatory
  roles. For stored programs, if execution should occur with
  roles different from the default, the program body can
  execute [`SET
  ROLE`](set-role.md "15.7.1.11 SET ROLE Statement") to activate the required roles. This must be
  done with caution since the privileges assigned to roles can
  be changed.

#### Revoking Roles or Role Privileges

Just as roles can be granted to an account, they can be revoked
from an account:

```sql
REVOKE role FROM user;
```

Roles named in the
[`mandatory_roles`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_mandatory_roles) system variable
value cannot be revoked.

[`REVOKE`](revoke.md "15.7.1.8 REVOKE Statement") can also be applied to a
role to modify the privileges granted to it. This affects not
only the role itself, but any account granted that role. Suppose
that you want to temporarily make all application users read
only. To do this, use [`REVOKE`](revoke.md "15.7.1.8 REVOKE Statement") to
revoke the modification privileges from the
`app_write` role:

```sql
REVOKE INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE ON app_db.* FROM 'app_write';
```

As it happens, that leaves the role with no privileges at all,
as can be seen using [`SHOW GRANTS`](show-grants.md "15.7.7.21 SHOW GRANTS Statement")
(which demonstrates that this statement can be used with roles,
not just users):

```sql
mysql> SHOW GRANTS FOR 'app_write';
+---------------------------------------+
| Grants for app_write@%                |
+---------------------------------------+
| GRANT USAGE ON *.* TO `app_write`@`%` |
+---------------------------------------+
```

Because revoking privileges from a role affects the privileges
for any user who is assigned the modified role,
`rw_user1` now has no table modification
privileges ([`INSERT`](privileges-provided.md#priv_insert),
[`UPDATE`](privileges-provided.md#priv_update), and
[`DELETE`](privileges-provided.md#priv_delete) are no longer present):

```sql
mysql> SHOW GRANTS FOR 'rw_user1'@'localhost'
       USING 'app_read', 'app_write';
+----------------------------------------------------------------+
| Grants for rw_user1@localhost                                  |
+----------------------------------------------------------------+
| GRANT USAGE ON *.* TO `rw_user1`@`localhost`                   |
| GRANT SELECT ON `app_db`.* TO `rw_user1`@`localhost`           |
| GRANT `app_read`@`%`,`app_write`@`%` TO `rw_user1`@`localhost` |
+----------------------------------------------------------------+
```

In effect, the `rw_user1` read/write user has
become a read-only user. This also occurs for any other accounts
that are granted the `app_write` role,
illustrating how use of roles makes it unnecessary to modify
privileges for individual accounts.

To restore modification privileges to the role, simply re-grant
them:

```sql
GRANT INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE ON app_db.* TO 'app_write';
```

Now `rw_user1` again has modification
privileges, as do any other accounts granted the
`app_write` role.

#### Dropping Roles

To drop roles, use [`DROP ROLE`](drop-role.md "15.7.1.4 DROP ROLE Statement"):

```sql
DROP ROLE 'app_read', 'app_write';
```

Dropping a role revokes it from every account to which it was
granted.

Roles named in the
[`mandatory_roles`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_mandatory_roles) system variable
value cannot be dropped.

#### User and Role Interchangeability

As has been hinted at earlier for [`SHOW
GRANTS`](show-grants.md "15.7.7.21 SHOW GRANTS Statement"), which displays grants for user accounts or
roles, accounts and roles can be used interchangeably.

One difference between roles and users is that
[`CREATE ROLE`](create-role.md "15.7.1.2 CREATE ROLE Statement") creates an
authorization identifier that is locked by default, whereas
[`CREATE USER`](create-user.md "15.7.1.3 CREATE USER Statement") creates an
authorization identifier that is unlocked by default. You should
keep in mind that this distinction is not immutable; a user with
appropriate privileges can lock or unlock roles or (other) users
after they have been created.

If a database administrator has a preference that a specific
authorization identifier must be a role, a name scheme can be
used to communicate this intention. For example, you could use a
`r_` prefix for all authorization identifiers
that you intend to be roles and nothing else.

Another difference between roles and users lies in the
privileges available for administering them:

- The [`CREATE ROLE`](privileges-provided.md#priv_create-role) and
  [`DROP ROLE`](privileges-provided.md#priv_drop-role) privileges enable
  only use of the [`CREATE ROLE`](create-role.md "15.7.1.2 CREATE ROLE Statement")
  and [`DROP ROLE`](drop-role.md "15.7.1.4 DROP ROLE Statement") statements,
  respectively.
- The [`CREATE USER`](privileges-provided.md#priv_create-user) privilege
  enables use of the [`ALTER
  USER`](alter-user.md "15.7.1.1 ALTER USER Statement"), [`CREATE ROLE`](create-role.md "15.7.1.2 CREATE ROLE Statement"),
  [`CREATE USER`](create-user.md "15.7.1.3 CREATE USER Statement"),
  [`DROP ROLE`](drop-role.md "15.7.1.4 DROP ROLE Statement"),
  [`DROP USER`](drop-user.md "15.7.1.5 DROP USER Statement"),
  [`RENAME USER`](rename-user.md "15.7.1.7 RENAME USER Statement"), and
  [`REVOKE ALL
  PRIVILEGES`](revoke.md "15.7.1.8 REVOKE Statement") statements.

Thus, the [`CREATE ROLE`](privileges-provided.md#priv_create-role) and
[`DROP ROLE`](privileges-provided.md#priv_drop-role) privileges are not as
powerful as [`CREATE USER`](privileges-provided.md#priv_create-user) and may
be granted to users who should only be permitted to create and
drop roles, and not perform more general account manipulation.

With regard to privileges and interchangeability of users and
roles, you can treat a user account like a role and grant that
account to another user or a role. The effect is to grant the
account's privileges and roles to the other user or role.

This set of statements demonstrates that you can grant a user to
a user, a role to a user, a user to a role, or a role to a role:

```sql
CREATE USER 'u1';
CREATE ROLE 'r1';
GRANT SELECT ON db1.* TO 'u1';
GRANT SELECT ON db2.* TO 'r1';
CREATE USER 'u2';
CREATE ROLE 'r2';
GRANT 'u1', 'r1' TO 'u2';
GRANT 'u1', 'r1' TO 'r2';
```

The result in each case is to grant to the grantee object the
privileges associated with the granted object. After executing
those statements, each of `u2` and
`r2` have been granted privileges from a user
(`u1`) and a role (`r1`):

```sql
mysql> SHOW GRANTS FOR 'u2' USING 'u1', 'r1';
+-------------------------------------+
| Grants for u2@%                     |
+-------------------------------------+
| GRANT USAGE ON *.* TO `u2`@`%`      |
| GRANT SELECT ON `db1`.* TO `u2`@`%` |
| GRANT SELECT ON `db2`.* TO `u2`@`%` |
| GRANT `u1`@`%`,`r1`@`%` TO `u2`@`%` |
+-------------------------------------+
mysql> SHOW GRANTS FOR 'r2' USING 'u1', 'r1';
+-------------------------------------+
| Grants for r2@%                     |
+-------------------------------------+
| GRANT USAGE ON *.* TO `r2`@`%`      |
| GRANT SELECT ON `db1`.* TO `r2`@`%` |
| GRANT SELECT ON `db2`.* TO `r2`@`%` |
| GRANT `u1`@`%`,`r1`@`%` TO `r2`@`%` |
+-------------------------------------+
```

The preceding example is illustrative only, but
interchangeability of user accounts and roles has practical
application, such as in the following situation: Suppose that a
legacy application development project began before the advent
of roles in MySQL, so all user accounts associated with the
project are granted privileges directly (rather than granted
privileges by virtue of being granted roles). One of these
accounts is a developer account that was originally granted
privileges as follows:

```sql
CREATE USER 'old_app_dev'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'old_app_devpass';
GRANT ALL ON old_app.* TO 'old_app_dev'@'localhost';
```

If this developer leaves the project, it becomes necessary to
assign the privileges to another user, or perhaps multiple users
if development activities have expanded. Here are some ways to
deal with the issue:

- Without using roles: Change the account password so the
  original developer cannot use it, and have a new developer
  use the account instead:

  ```sql
  ALTER USER 'old_app_dev'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'new_password';
  ```
- Using roles: Lock the account to prevent anyone from using
  it to connect to the server:

  ```sql
  ALTER USER 'old_app_dev'@'localhost' ACCOUNT LOCK;
  ```

  Then treat the account as a role. For each developer new to
  the project, create a new account and grant to it the
  original developer account:

  ```sql
  CREATE USER 'new_app_dev1'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'new_password';
  GRANT 'old_app_dev'@'localhost' TO 'new_app_dev1'@'localhost';
  ```

  The effect is to assign the original developer account
  privileges to the new account.
