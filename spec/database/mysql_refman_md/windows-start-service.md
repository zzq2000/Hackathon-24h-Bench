#### 2.3.4.8 Starting MySQL as a Windows Service

On Windows, the recommended way to run MySQL is to install it as
a Windows service, so that MySQL starts and stops automatically
when Windows starts and stops. A MySQL server installed as a
service can also be controlled from the command line using
**NET** commands, or with the graphical
**Services** utility. Generally, to install MySQL
as a Windows service you should be logged in using an account
that has administrator rights.

The **Services** utility (the Windows
**Service Control Manager**) can be found in the
Windows Control Panel. To avoid conflicts, it is advisable to
close the **Services** utility while performing
server installation or removal operations from the command line.

##### Installing the service

Before installing MySQL as a Windows service, you should first
stop the current server if it is running by using the following
command:

```terminal
C:\> "C:\Program Files\MySQL\MySQL Server 8.0\bin\mysqladmin"
          -u root shutdown
```

Note

If the MySQL `root` user account has a
password, you need to invoke [**mysqladmin**](mysqladmin.md "6.5.2 mysqladmin — A MySQL Server Administration Program")
with the `-p` option and supply the password
when prompted.

This command invokes the MySQL administrative utility
[**mysqladmin**](mysqladmin.md "6.5.2 mysqladmin — A MySQL Server Administration Program") to connect to the server and tell
it to shut down. The command connects as the MySQL
`root` user, which is the default
administrative account in the MySQL grant system.

Note

Users in the MySQL grant system are wholly independent from
any operating system users under Windows.

Install the server as a service using this command:

```terminal
C:\> "C:\Program Files\MySQL\MySQL Server 8.0\bin\mysqld" --install
```

The service-installation command does not start the server.
Instructions for that are given later in this section.

To make it easier to invoke MySQL programs, you can add the path
name of the MySQL `bin` directory to your
Windows system `PATH` environment variable:

- On the Windows desktop, right-click the My
  Computer icon, and select
  Properties.
- Next select the Advanced tab from
  the System Properties menu that appears,
  and click the Environment Variables
  button.
- Under System Variables, select
  Path, and then click the
  Edit button. The Edit System
  Variable dialogue should appear.
- Place your cursor at the end of the text appearing in the
  space marked Variable Value. (Use the
  **End** key to ensure that your cursor is
  positioned at the very end of the text in this space.) Then
  enter the complete path name of your MySQL
  `bin` directory (for example,
  `C:\Program Files\MySQL\MySQL Server
  8.0\bin`), and there should be a
  semicolon separating this path from any values present in
  this field. Dismiss this dialogue, and each dialogue in
  turn, by clicking OK until all of the
  dialogues that were opened have been dismissed. You should
  now be able to invoke any MySQL executable program by typing
  its name at the DOS prompt from any directory on the system,
  without having to supply the path. This includes the
  servers, the [**mysql**](mysql.md "6.5.1 mysql — The MySQL Command-Line Client") client, and all MySQL
  command-line utilities such as [**mysqladmin**](mysqladmin.md "6.5.2 mysqladmin — A MySQL Server Administration Program")
  and [**mysqldump**](mysqldump.md "6.5.4 mysqldump — A Database Backup Program").

  You should not add the MySQL `bin`
  directory to your Windows `PATH` if you are
  running multiple MySQL servers on the same machine.

Warning

You must exercise great care when editing your system
`PATH` by hand; accidental deletion or
modification of any portion of the existing
`PATH` value can leave you with a
malfunctioning or even unusable system.

The following additional arguments can be used when installing
the service:

- You can specify a service name immediately following the
  `--install` option. The default service name
  is `MySQL`.
- If a service name is given, it can be followed by a single
  option. By convention, this should be
  [`--defaults-file=file_name`](option-file-options.md#option_general_defaults-file)
  to specify the name of an option file from which the server
  should read options when it starts.

  The use of a single option other than
  [`--defaults-file`](option-file-options.md#option_general_defaults-file) is possible
  but discouraged.
  [`--defaults-file`](option-file-options.md#option_general_defaults-file) is more
  flexible because it enables you to specify multiple startup
  options for the server by placing them in the named option
  file.
- You can also specify a `--local-service`
  option following the service name. This causes the server to
  run using the `LocalService` Windows
  account that has limited system privileges. If both
  [`--defaults-file`](option-file-options.md#option_general_defaults-file) and
  `--local-service` are given following the
  service name, they can be in any order.

For a MySQL server that is installed as a Windows service, the
following rules determine the service name and option files that
the server uses:

- If the service-installation command specifies no service
  name or the default service name (`MySQL`)
  following the `--install` option, the server
  uses the service name of `MySQL` and reads
  options from the `[mysqld]` group in the
  standard option files.
- If the service-installation command specifies a service name
  other than `MySQL` following the
  `--install` option, the server uses that
  service name. It reads options from the
  `[mysqld]` group and the group that has the
  same name as the service in the standard option files. This
  enables you to use the `[mysqld]` group for
  options that should be used by all MySQL services, and an
  option group with the service name for use by the server
  installed with that service name.
- If the service-installation command specifies a
  [`--defaults-file`](option-file-options.md#option_general_defaults-file) option after
  the service name, the server reads options the same way as
  described in the previous item, except that it reads options
  only from the named file and ignores the standard option
  files.

As a more complex example, consider the following command:

```terminal
C:\> "C:\Program Files\MySQL\MySQL Server 8.0\bin\mysqld"
          --install MySQL --defaults-file=C:\my-opts.cnf
```

Here, the default service name (`MySQL`) is
given after the `--install` option. If no
[`--defaults-file`](option-file-options.md#option_general_defaults-file) option had been
given, this command would have the effect of causing the server
to read the `[mysqld]` group from the standard
option files. However, because the
[`--defaults-file`](option-file-options.md#option_general_defaults-file) option is
present, the server reads options from the
`[mysqld]` option group, and only from the
named file.

Note

On Windows, if the server is started with the
[`--defaults-file`](option-file-options.md#option_general_defaults-file) and
[`--install`](server-options.md#option_mysqld_install) options,
[`--install`](server-options.md#option_mysqld_install) must be first.
Otherwise, `mysqld.exe` attempts to start the
MySQL server.

You can also specify options as Start parameters in the Windows
**Services** utility before you start the MySQL
service.

Finally, before trying to start the MySQL service, make sure the
user variables `%TEMP%` and
`%TMP%` (and also `%TMPDIR%`,
if it has ever been set) for the operating system user who is to
run the service are pointing to a folder to which the user has
write access. The default user for running the MySQL service is
`LocalSystem`, and the default value for its
`%TEMP%` and `%TMP%` is
`C:\Windows\Temp`, a directory
`LocalSystem` has write access to by default.
However, if there are any changes to that default setup (for
example, changes to the user who runs the service or to the
mentioned user variables, or the
[`--tmpdir`](server-options.md#option_mysqld_tmpdir) option has been used to
put the temporary directory somewhere else), the MySQL service
might fail to run because write access to the temporary
directory has not been granted to the proper user.

##### Starting the service

After a MySQL server instance has been installed as a service,
Windows starts the service automatically whenever Windows
starts. The service also can be started immediately from the
**Services** utility, or by using an **sc
start *`mysqld_service_name`***
or **NET START
*`mysqld_service_name`***
command. **SC** and **NET**
commands are not case-sensitive.

When run as a service, [**mysqld**](mysqld.md "6.3.1 mysqld — The MySQL Server") has no access
to a console window, so no messages can be seen there. If
[**mysqld**](mysqld.md "6.3.1 mysqld — The MySQL Server") does not start, check the error log to
see whether the server wrote any messages there to indicate the
cause of the problem. The error log is located in the MySQL data
directory (for example, `C:\Program Files\MySQL\MySQL
Server 8.0\data`). It is the file with a
suffix of `.err`.

When a MySQL server has been installed as a service, and the
service is running, Windows stops the service automatically when
Windows shuts down. The server also can be stopped manually
using the `Services` utility, the **sc
stop *`mysqld_service_name`***
command, the **NET STOP
*`mysqld_service_name`***
command, or the [**mysqladmin shutdown**](mysqladmin.md "6.5.2 mysqladmin — A MySQL Server Administration Program") command.

You also have the choice of installing the server as a manual
service if you do not wish for the service to be started
automatically during the boot process. To do this, use the
`--install-manual` option rather than the
`--install` option:

```terminal
C:\> "C:\Program Files\MySQL\MySQL Server 8.0\bin\mysqld" --install-manual
```

##### Removing the service

To remove a server that is installed as a service, first stop it
if it is running by executing **SC STOP
*`mysqld_service_name`*** or
**NET STOP
*`mysqld_service_name`***. Then
use **SC DELETE
*`mysqld_service_name`*** to
remove it:

```terminal
C:\> SC DELETE mysql
```

Alternatively, use the [**mysqld**](mysqld.md "6.3.1 mysqld — The MySQL Server")
[`--remove`](server-options.md#option_mysqld_remove) option to remove the
service.

```terminal
C:\> "C:\Program Files\MySQL\MySQL Server 8.0\bin\mysqld" --remove
```

If [**mysqld**](mysqld.md "6.3.1 mysqld — The MySQL Server") is not running as a service, you
can start it from the command line. For instructions, see
[Section 2.3.4.6, “Starting MySQL from the Windows Command Line”](windows-start-command-line.md "2.3.4.6 Starting MySQL from the Windows Command Line").

If you encounter difficulties during installation, see
[Section 2.3.5, “Troubleshooting a Microsoft Windows MySQL Server Installation”](windows-troubleshooting.md "2.3.5 Troubleshooting a Microsoft Windows MySQL Server Installation").

For more information about stopping or removing a Windows
service, see [Section 7.8.2.2, “Starting Multiple MySQL Instances as Windows Services”](multiple-windows-services.md "7.8.2.2 Starting Multiple MySQL Instances as Windows Services").
