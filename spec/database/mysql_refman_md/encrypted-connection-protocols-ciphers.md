### 8.3.2 Encrypted Connection TLS Protocols and Ciphers

MySQL supports multiple TLS protocols and ciphers, and enables
configuring which protocols and ciphers to permit for encrypted
connections. It is also possible to determine which protocol and
cipher the current session uses.

#### Supported TLS Protocols

The set of protocols permitted for connections to a given MySQL
server instance is subject to multiple factors as follows:

MySQL Server release
:   - Up to and including MySQL 8.0.15, MySQL supports the
      TLSv1, TLSv1.1, and TLSv1.2 protocols.
    - As of MySQL 8.0.16, MySQL also supports the TLSv1.3
      protocol. To use TLSv1.3, both the MySQL server and
      the client application must be compiled using OpenSSL
      1.1.1 or higher. The Group Replication component
      supports TLSv1.3 from MySQL 8.0.18 (for details, see
      [Section 20.6.2, “Securing Group Communication Connections with Secure Socket Layer (SSL)”](group-replication-secure-socket-layer-support-ssl.md "20.6.2 Securing Group Communication Connections with Secure Socket Layer (SSL)")).
    - As of MySQL 8.0.26, the TLSv1 and TLSv1.1 protocols
      are deprecated. These protocol versions are old,
      released in 1996 and 2006, respectively, and the
      algorithms used are weak and outdated. For background,
      refer to the IETF memo
      [Deprecating
      TLSv1.0 and TLSv1.1](https://tools.ietf.org/id/draft-ietf-tls-oldversions-deprecate-02.html).
    - As of MySQL 8.0.28, MySQL no longer supports the TLSv1
      and TLSv1.1 protocols. From this release, clients
      cannot make a TLS/SSL connection with the protocol set
      to TLSv1 or TLSv1.1. For more details, see
      [Removal of Support for the TLSv1 and TLSv1.1 Protocols](encrypted-connection-protocols-ciphers.md#encrypted-connection-deprecated-protocols "Removal of Support for the TLSv1 and TLSv1.1 Protocols").

    **Table 8.13 MySQL Server TLS Protocol Support**

    | MySQL Server Release | TLS Protocols Supported |
    | --- | --- |
    | MySQL 8.0.15 and below | TLSv1, TLSv1.1, TLSv1.2 |
    | MySQL 8.0.16 and MySQL 8.0.17 | TLSv1, TLSv1.1, TLSv1.2, TLSv1.3 (except Group Replication) |
    | MySQL 8.0.18 through MySQL 8.0.25 | TLSv1, TLSv1.1, TLSv1.2, TLSv1.3 (including Group Replication) |
    | MySQL 8.0.26 and MySQL 8.0.27 | TLSv1 (deprecated), TLSv1.1 (deprecated), TLSv1.2, TLSv1.3 |
    | MySQL 8.0.28 and above | TLSv1.2, TLSv1.3 |

SSL library
:   If the SSL library does not support a particular protocol,
    neither does MySQL, and any parts of the following
    discussion that specify that protocol do not apply. In
    particular, note that to use TLSv1.3, both the MySQL
    server and the client application must be compiled using
    OpenSSL 1.1.1 or higher. MySQL Server checks the version
    of OpenSSL at startup, and if it is lower than 1.1.1,
    TLSv1.3 is removed from the default value for the server
    system variables relating to TLS versions
    ([`tls_version`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_tls_version),
    [`admin_tls_version`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_admin_tls_version), and
    [`group_replication_recovery_tls_version`](group-replication-system-variables.md#sysvar_group_replication_recovery_tls_version)).

MySQL instance configuration
:   Permitted TLS protocols can be configured on both the
    server side and client side to include only a subset of
    the supported TLS protocols. The configuration on both
    sides must include at least one protocol in common or
    connection attempts cannot negotiate a protocol to use.
    For details, see
    [Connection TLS Protocol Negotiation](encrypted-connection-protocols-ciphers.md#encrypted-connection-protocol-negotiation "Connection TLS Protocol Negotiation").

System-wide host configuration
:   The host system may permit only certain TLS protocols,
    which means that MySQL connections cannot use nonpermitted
    protocols even if MySQL itself permits them:

    - Suppose that MySQL configuration permits TLSv1,
      TLSv1.1, and TLSv1.2, but your host system
      configuration permits only connections that use
      TLSv1.2 or higher. In this case, you cannot establish
      MySQL connections that use TLSv1 or TLSv1.1, even
      though MySQL is configured to permit them, because the
      host system does not permit them.
    - If MySQL configuration permits TLSv1, TLSv1.1, and
      TLSv1.2, but your host system configuration permits
      only connections that use TLSv1.3 or higher, you
      cannot establish MySQL connections at all, because no
      protocol permitted by MySQL is permitted by the host
      system.

    Workarounds for this issue include:

    - Change the system-wide host configuration to permit
      additional TLS protocols. Consult your operating
      system documentation for instructions. For example,
      your system may have an
      `/etc/ssl/openssl.cnf` file that
      contains these lines to restrict TLS protocols to
      TLSv1.2 or higher:

      ```ini
      [system_default_sect]
      MinProtocol = TLSv1.2
      ```

      Changing the value to a lower protocol version or
      `None` makes the system more
      permissive. This workaround has the disadvantage that
      permitting lower (less secure) protocols may have
      adverse security consequences.
    - If you cannot or prefer not to change the host system
      TLS configuration, change MySQL applications to use
      higher (more secure) TLS protocols that are permitted
      by the host system. This may not be possible for older
      versions of MySQL that support only lower protocol
      versions. For example, TLSv1 is the only supported
      protocol prior to MySQL 5.6.46, so attempts to connect
      to a pre-5.6.46 server fail even if the client is from
      a newer MySQL version that supports higher protocol
      versions. In such cases, an upgrade to a version of
      MySQL that supports additional TLS versions may be
      required.

#### Removal of Support for the TLSv1 and TLSv1.1 Protocols

Support for the TLSv1 and TLSv1.1 connection protocols is
removed as of MySQL 8.0.28. The protocols were deprecated from
MySQL 8.0.26. For background information, refer to
[RFC
8996](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc8996) (Deprecating TLS 1.0 and TLS 1.1). It is
recommended that connections be made using the more-secure
TLSv1.2 and TLSv1.3 protocols. TLSv1.3 requires that both the
MySQL server and the client application are compiled with
OpenSSL 1.1.1.

Support for TLSv1 and TLSv1.1 is removed because those protocol
versions are old, released in 1996 and 2006, respectively. The
algorithms used are weak and outdated. Unless you are using very
old versions of MySQL Server or connectors, you are unlikely to
have connections using TLSv1.0 or TLSv1.1. MySQL connectors and
clients select the highest TLS version available by default.

In the releases where the TLSv1 and TLSv1.1 connection protocols
are unsupported (from MySQL 8.0.28 onwards), clients, including
MySQL Shell, that support a
[`--tls-version`](connection-options.md#option_general_tls-version) option
for specifying TLS protocols for connections to the MySQL server
cannot make a TLS/SSL connection with the protocol set to TLSv1
or TLSv1.1. If a client attempts to connect using these
protocols, for TCP connections, the connection fails, and an
error is returned to the client. For socket connections, if
[`--ssl-mode`](connection-options.md#option_general_ssl-mode) is set to
`REQUIRED`, the connection fails, otherwise the
connection is made but with TLS/SSL disabled.

On the server side, the following settings are changed from
MySQL 8.0.28:

- The default values of the server’s
  [`tls_version`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_tls_version) and
  [`admin_tls_version`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_admin_tls_version) system
  variables no longer include TLSv1 and TLSv1.1.
- The default value of the Group Replication system variable
  [`group_replication_recovery_tls_version`](group-replication-system-variables.md#sysvar_group_replication_recovery_tls_version)
  no longer includes TLSv1 and TLSv1.1.
- For asynchronous replication, replicas cannot set the
  protocol for connections to the source server to TLSv1 or
  TLSv1.1 (the `SOURCE_TLS_VERSION` option of
  the [`CHANGE REPLICATION SOURCE
  TO`](change-replication-source-to.md "15.4.2.3 CHANGE REPLICATION SOURCE TO Statement") statement).

In the releases where the TLSv1 and TLSv1.1 connection protocols
are deprecated (MySQL 8.0.26 and MySQL 8.0.27), the server
writes a warning to the error log if they are included in the
values of the [`tls_version`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_tls_version) or
[`admin_tls_version`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_admin_tls_version) system
variable, and if a client successfully connects using them. A
warning is also returned if you set the deprecated protocols at
runtime and implement them using the `ALTER INSTANCE
RELOAD TLS` statement. Clients, including replicas that
specify TLS protocols for connections to the source server and
Group Replication group members that specify TLS protocols for
distributed recovery connections, do not issue warnings if they
are configured to permit a deprecated TLS protocol.

For more information, see
[Does MySQL 8.0 support
TLS 1.0 and 1.1?](faqs-security.md#faq-mysql-tls-versions "A.9.7.")

#### Connection TLS Protocol Configuration

On the server side, the value of the
[`tls_version`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_tls_version) system variable
determines which TLS protocols a MySQL server permits for
encrypted connections. The
[`tls_version`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_tls_version) value applies to
connections from clients, regular source/replica replication
connections where this server instance is the source, Group
Replication group communication connections, and Group
Replication distributed recovery connections where this server
instance is the donor. The administrative connection interface
is configured similarly, but uses the
[`admin_tls_version`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_admin_tls_version) system
variable (see
[Section 7.1.12.2, “Administrative Connection Management”](administrative-connection-interface.md "7.1.12.2 Administrative Connection Management")). This
discussion applies to
[`admin_tls_version`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_admin_tls_version) as well.

The [`tls_version`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_tls_version) value is a list
of one or more comma-separated TLS protocol versions, which is
not case-sensitive. By default, this variable lists all
protocols that are supported by the SSL library used to compile
MySQL and by the MySQL Server release. The default settings are
therefore as shown in [Table 8.14, “MySQL Server TLS Protocol Default Settings”](encrypted-connection-protocols-ciphers.md#tls-support-defaults "Table 8.14 MySQL Server TLS Protocol Default Settings").

**Table 8.14 MySQL Server TLS Protocol Default Settings**

| MySQL Server Release | `tls_version` Default Setting |
| --- | --- |
| MySQL 8.0.15 and below | `TLSv1,TLSv1.1,TLSv1.2` |
| MySQL 8.0.16 and MySQL 8.0.17 | `TLSv1,TLSv1.1,TLSv1.2,TLSv1.3 (with OpenSSL 1.1.1)`  `TLSv1,TLSv1.1,TLSv1.2 (otherwise)`  Group Replication does not support TLSv1.3 |
| MySQL 8.0.18 through MySQL 8.0.25 | `TLSv1,TLSv1.1,TLSv1.2,TLSv1.3 (with OpenSSL 1.1.1)`  `TLSv1,TLSv1.1,TLSv1.2 (otherwise)`  Group Replication supports TLSv1.3 |
| MySQL 8.0.26 and MySQL 8.0.27 | `TLSv1,TLSv1.1,TLSv1.2,TLSv1.3 (with OpenSSL 1.1.1)`  `TLSv1,TLSv1.1,TLSv1.2 (otherwise)`  TLSv1 and TLSv1.1 are deprecated |
| MySQL 8.0.28 and above | `TLSv1.2,TLSv1.3` |

To determine the value of
[`tls_version`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_tls_version) at runtime, use
this statement:

```sql
mysql> SHOW GLOBAL VARIABLES LIKE 'tls_version';
+---------------+-----------------------+
| Variable_name | Value                 |
+---------------+-----------------------+
| tls_version   | TLSv1.2,TLSv1.3       |
+---------------+-----------------------+
```

To change the value of
[`tls_version`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_tls_version), set it at server
startup. For example, to permit connections that use the TLSv1.2
or TLSv1.3 protocol, but prohibit connections that use the
less-secure TLSv1 and TLSv1.1 protocols, use these lines in the
server `my.cnf` file:

```ini
[mysqld]
tls_version=TLSv1.2,TLSv1.3
```

To be even more restrictive and permit only TLSv1.3 connections,
set [`tls_version`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_tls_version) like this:

```ini
[mysqld]
tls_version=TLSv1.3
```

As of MySQL 8.0.16, `tls_version` can be
changed at runtime. See
[Server-Side Runtime Configuration and Monitoring for Encrypted
Connections](using-encrypted-connections.md#using-encrypted-connections-server-side-runtime-configuration "Server-Side Runtime Configuration and Monitoring for Encrypted Connections").

On the client side, the
[`--tls-version`](connection-options.md#option_general_tls-version) option specifies
which TLS protocols a client program permits for connections to
the server. The format of the option value is the same as for
the [`tls_version`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_tls_version) system variable
described previously (a list of one or more comma-separated
protocol versions).

For source/replica replication connections where this server
instance is the replica, the
`SOURCE_TLS_VERSION` |
`MASTER_TLS_VERSION` option for the
[`CHANGE REPLICATION SOURCE TO`](change-replication-source-to.md "15.4.2.3 CHANGE REPLICATION SOURCE TO Statement")
statement (from MySQL 8.0.23) or [`CHANGE
MASTER TO`](change-master-to.md "15.4.2.1 CHANGE MASTER TO Statement") statement (before MySQL 8.0.23) specifies
which TLS protocols the replica permits for connections to the
source. The format of the option value is the same as for the
[`tls_version`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_tls_version) system variable
described previously. See
[Section 19.3.1, “Setting Up Replication to Use Encrypted Connections”](replication-encrypted-connections.md "19.3.1 Setting Up Replication to Use Encrypted Connections").

The protocols that can be specified for
`SOURCE_TLS_VERSION` |
`MASTER_TLS_VERSION` depend on the SSL library.
This option is independent of and not affected by the server
[`tls_version`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_tls_version) value. For example,
a server that acts as a replica can be configured with
[`tls_version`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_tls_version) set to TLSv1.3 to
permit only incoming connections that use TLSv1.3, but also
configured with `SOURCE_TLS_VERSION` |
`MASTER_TLS_VERSION` set to TLSv1.2 to permit
only TLSv1.2 for outgoing replica connections to the source.

For Group Replication distributed recovery connections where
this server instance is the joining member that initiates
distributed recovery (that is, the client), the
[`group_replication_recovery_tls_version`](group-replication-system-variables.md#sysvar_group_replication_recovery_tls_version)
system variable specifies which protocols are permitted by the
client. Again, this option is independent of and not affected by
the server [`tls_version`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_tls_version) value,
which applies when this server instance is the donor. A Group
Replication server generally participates in distributed
recovery both as a donor and as a joining member over the course
of its group membership, so both these system variables should
be set. See
[Section 20.6.2, “Securing Group Communication Connections with Secure Socket Layer (SSL)”](group-replication-secure-socket-layer-support-ssl.md "20.6.2 Securing Group Communication Connections with Secure Socket Layer (SSL)").

TLS protocol configuration affects which protocol a given
connection uses, as described in
[Connection TLS Protocol Negotiation](encrypted-connection-protocols-ciphers.md#encrypted-connection-protocol-negotiation "Connection TLS Protocol Negotiation").

Permitted protocols should be chosen such as not to leave
“holes” in the list. For example, these server
configuration values do not have holes:

```terminal
tls_version=TLSv1,TLSv1.1,TLSv1.2,TLSv1.3
tls_version=TLSv1.1,TLSv1.2,TLSv1.3
tls_version=TLSv1.2,TLSv1.3
tls_version=TLSv1.3
```

These values do have holes and should not be used:

```terminal
tls_version=TLSv1,TLSv1.2       (TLSv1.1 is missing)
tls_version=TLSv1.1,TLSv1.3     (TLSv1.2 is missing)
```

The prohibition on holes also applies in other configuration
contexts, such as for clients or replicas.

Unless you intend to disable encrypted connections, the list of
permitted protocols should not be empty. If you set a TLS
version parameter to the empty string, encrypted connections
cannot be established:

- [`tls_version`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_tls_version): The server
  does not permit encrypted incoming connections.
- [`--tls-version`](connection-options.md#option_general_tls-version): The client
  does not permit encrypted outgoing connections to the
  server.
- `SOURCE_TLS_VERSION` |
  `MASTER_TLS_VERSION`: The replica does not
  permit encrypted outgoing connections to the source.
- [`group_replication_recovery_tls_version`](group-replication-system-variables.md#sysvar_group_replication_recovery_tls_version):
  The joining member does not permit encrypted connections to
  the distributed recovery connection.

#### Connection Cipher Configuration

A default set of ciphers applies to encrypted connections, which
can be overridden by explicitly configuring the permitted
ciphers. During connection establishment, both sides of a
connection must permit some cipher in common or the connection
fails. Of the permitted ciphers common to both sides, the SSL
library chooses the one supported by the provided certificate
that has the highest priority.

To specify a cipher or ciphers applicable for encrypted
connections that use TLS protocols up through TLSv1.2:

- Set the [`ssl_cipher`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_ssl_cipher) system
  variable on the server side, and use the
  [`--ssl-cipher`](connection-options.md#option_general_ssl-cipher) option for
  client programs.
- For regular source/replica replication connections, where
  this server instance is the source, set the
  [`ssl_cipher`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_ssl_cipher) system variable.
  Where this server instance is the replica, use the
  `SOURCE_SSL_CIPHER` |
  `MASTER_SSL_CIPHER` option for the
  [`CHANGE REPLICATION SOURCE TO`](change-replication-source-to.md "15.4.2.3 CHANGE REPLICATION SOURCE TO Statement")
  statement (from MySQL 8.0.23) or [`CHANGE
  MASTER TO`](change-master-to.md "15.4.2.1 CHANGE MASTER TO Statement") statement (before MySQL 8.0.23). See
  [Section 19.3.1, “Setting Up Replication to Use Encrypted Connections”](replication-encrypted-connections.md "19.3.1 Setting Up Replication to Use Encrypted Connections").
- For a Group Replication group member, for Group Replication
  group communication connections and also for Group
  Replication distributed recovery connections where this
  server instance is the donor, set the
  [`ssl_cipher`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_ssl_cipher) system variable.
  For Group Replication distributed recovery connections where
  this server instance is the joining member, use the
  [`group_replication_recovery_ssl_cipher`](group-replication-system-variables.md#sysvar_group_replication_recovery_ssl_cipher)
  system variable. See
  [Section 20.6.2, “Securing Group Communication Connections with Secure Socket Layer (SSL)”](group-replication-secure-socket-layer-support-ssl.md "20.6.2 Securing Group Communication Connections with Secure Socket Layer (SSL)").

For encrypted connections that use TLSv1.3, OpenSSL 1.1.1 and
higher supports the following ciphersuites, the first three of
which are enabled by default:

```none
TLS_AES_128_GCM_SHA256
TLS_AES_256_GCM_SHA384
TLS_CHACHA20_POLY1305_SHA256
TLS_AES_128_CCM_SHA256
```

Note

Prior to MySQL 8.0.35,
`TLS_AES_128_CCM_8_SHA256` was supported for
use with server system variables
[`--tls-ciphersuites`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_tls_ciphersuites) or
[`--admin-tls-ciphersuites`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_admin_tls_ciphersuites).
`TLS_AES_128_CCM_8_SHA256` generates a
deprecation warning if configured for MySQL 8.0.35 and higher.

To configure the permitted TLSv1.3 ciphersuites explicitly, set
the following parameters. In each case, the configuration value
is a list of zero or more colon-separated ciphersuite names.

- On the server side, use the
  [`tls_ciphersuites`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_tls_ciphersuites) system
  variable. If this variable is not set, its default value is
  `NULL`, which means that the server permits
  the default set of ciphersuites. If the variable is set to
  the empty string, no ciphersuites are enabled and encrypted
  connections cannot be established.
- On the client side, use the
  [`--tls-ciphersuites`](connection-options.md#option_general_tls-ciphersuites) option.
  If this option is not set, the client permits the default
  set of ciphersuites. If the option is set to the empty
  string, no ciphersuites are enabled and encrypted
  connections cannot be established.
- For regular source/replica replication connections, where
  this server instance is the source, use the
  [`tls_ciphersuites`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_tls_ciphersuites) system
  variable. Where this server instance is the replica, use the
  `SOURCE_TLS_CIPHERSUITES` |
  `MASTER_TLS_CIPHERSUITES` option for the
  [`CHANGE REPLICATION SOURCE TO`](change-replication-source-to.md "15.4.2.3 CHANGE REPLICATION SOURCE TO Statement")
  statement (from MySQL 8.0.23) or [`CHANGE
  MASTER TO`](change-master-to.md "15.4.2.1 CHANGE MASTER TO Statement") statement (before MySQL 8.0.23). See
  [Section 19.3.1, “Setting Up Replication to Use Encrypted Connections”](replication-encrypted-connections.md "19.3.1 Setting Up Replication to Use Encrypted Connections").
- For a Group Replication group member, for Group Replication
  group communication connections and also for Group
  Replication distributed recovery connections where this
  server instance is the donor, use the
  [`tls_ciphersuites`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_tls_ciphersuites) system
  variable. For Group Replication distributed recovery
  connections where this server instance is the joining
  member, use the
  [`group_replication_recovery_tls_ciphersuites`](group-replication-system-variables.md#sysvar_group_replication_recovery_tls_ciphersuites)
  system variable. See
  [Section 20.6.2, “Securing Group Communication Connections with Secure Socket Layer (SSL)”](group-replication-secure-socket-layer-support-ssl.md "20.6.2 Securing Group Communication Connections with Secure Socket Layer (SSL)").

Note

Ciphersuite support is available as of MySQL 8.0.16, but
requires that both the MySQL server and the client application
be compiled using OpenSSL 1.1.1 or higher.

In MySQL 8.0.16 through 8.0.18, the
[`group_replication_recovery_tls_ciphersuites`](group-replication-system-variables.md#sysvar_group_replication_recovery_tls_ciphersuites)
system variable and the
`SOURCE_TLS_CIPHERSUITES` |
`MASTER_TLS_CIPHERSUITES` option for the
[`CHANGE REPLICATION SOURCE TO`](change-replication-source-to.md "15.4.2.3 CHANGE REPLICATION SOURCE TO Statement")
statement (from MySQL 8.0.23) or [`CHANGE
MASTER TO`](change-master-to.md "15.4.2.1 CHANGE MASTER TO Statement") statement (before MySQL 8.0.23) are not
available. In these releases, if TLSv1.3 is used for
source/replica replication connections, or in Group
Replication for distributed recovery (supported from MySQL
8.0.18), the replication source or Group Replication donor
servers must permit the use of at least one TLSv1.3
ciphersuite that is enabled by default. From MySQL 8.0.19, you
can use the options to configure client support for any
selection of ciphersuites, including only non-default
ciphersuites if you want.

A given cipher may work only with particular TLS protocols,
which affects the TLS protocol negotiation process. See
[Connection TLS Protocol Negotiation](encrypted-connection-protocols-ciphers.md#encrypted-connection-protocol-negotiation "Connection TLS Protocol Negotiation").

To determine which ciphers a given server supports, check the
session value of the
[`Ssl_cipher_list`](server-status-variables.md#statvar_Ssl_cipher_list) status
variable:

```sql
SHOW SESSION STATUS LIKE 'Ssl_cipher_list';
```

The [`Ssl_cipher_list`](server-status-variables.md#statvar_Ssl_cipher_list) status
variable lists the possible SSL ciphers (empty for non-SSL
connections). If MySQL supports TLSv1.3, the value includes the
possible TLSv1.3 ciphersuites.

Note

ECDSA ciphers only work in combination with an SSL certificate
that uses ECDSA for the digital signature, and they do not
work with certificates that use RSA. MySQL Server’s
automatic generation process for SSL certificates does not
generate ECDSA signed certificates, it generates only RSA
signed certificates. Do not select ECDSA ciphers unless you
have an ECDSA certificate available to you.

For encrypted connections that use TLS.v1.3, MySQL uses the SSL
library default ciphersuite list.

For encrypted connections that use TLS protocols up through
TLSv1.2, MySQL passes the following default cipher list to the
SSL library.

```none
ECDHE-ECDSA-AES128-GCM-SHA256
ECDHE-ECDSA-AES256-GCM-SHA384
ECDHE-RSA-AES128-GCM-SHA256
ECDHE-RSA-AES256-GCM-SHA384
ECDHE-ECDSA-CHACHA20-POLY1305
ECDHE-RSA-CHACHA20-POLY1305
ECDHE-ECDSA-AES256-CCM
ECDHE-ECDSA-AES128-CCM
DHE-RSA-AES128-GCM-SHA256
DHE-RSA-AES256-GCM-SHA384
DHE-RSA-AES256-CCM
DHE-RSA-AES128-CCM

a certificate that uses any of the preceding restricted ciphers
or cipher categories, the server starts with support for
encrypted connections disabled.

#### Connection TLS Protocol Negotiation

Connection attempts in MySQL negotiate use of the highest TLS
protocol version available on both sides for which a
protocol-compatible encryption cipher is available on both
sides. The negotiation process depends on factors such as the
SSL library used to compile the server and client, the TLS
protocol and encryption cipher configuration, and which key size
is used:

- For a connection attempt to succeed, the server and client
  TLS protocol configuration must permit some protocol in
  common.
- Similarly, the server and client encryption cipher
  configuration must permit some cipher in common. A given
  cipher may work only with particular TLS protocols, so a
  protocol available to the negotiation process is not chosen
  unless there is also a compatible cipher.
- If TLSv1.3 is available, it is used if possible. (This means
  that server and client configuration both must permit
  TLSv1.3, and both must also permit some TLSv1.3-compatible
  encryption cipher.) Otherwise, MySQL continues through the
  list of available protocols, using TLSv1.2 if possible, and
  so forth. Negotiation proceeds from more secure protocols to
  less secure. Negotiation order is independent of the order
  in which protocols are configured. For example, negotiation
  order is the same regardless of whether
  [`tls_version`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_tls_version) has a value of
  `TLSv1,TLSv1.1,TLSv1.2,TLSv1.3` or
  `TLSv1.3,TLSv1.2,TLSv1.1,TLSv1`.
- TLSv1.2 does not work with all ciphers that have a key size
  of 512 bits or less. To use this protocol with such a key,
  set the [`ssl_cipher`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_ssl_cipher) system
  variable on the server side or use the
  [`--ssl-cipher`](connection-options.md#option_general_ssl-cipher) client option
  to specify the cipher name explicitly:

  ```none
  AES128-SHA
  AES128-SHA256
  AES256-SHA
  AES256-SHA256
  CAMELLIA128-SHA
  CAMELLIA256-SHA
  DES-CBC3-SHA
  DHE-RSA-AES256-SHA
  RC4-MD5
  RC4-SHA
  SEED-SHA
  ```
- For better security, use a certificate with an RSA key size
  of at least 2048 bits.

If the server and client do not have a permitted protocol in
common, and a protocol-compatible cipher in common, the server
terminates the connection request. Examples:

- If the server is configured with
  [`tls_version=TLSv1.1,TLSv1.2`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_tls_version):

  - Connection attempts fail for clients invoked with
    [`--tls-version=TLSv1`](connection-options.md#option_general_tls-version), and
    for older clients that support only TLSv1.
  - Similarly, connection attempts fail for replicas
    configured with `MASTER_TLS_VERSION =
    'TLSv1'`, and for older replicas that support
    only TLSv1.
- If the server is configured with
  [`tls_version=TLSv1`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_tls_version) or is an
  older server that supports only TLSv1:

  - Connection attempts fail for clients invoked with
    [`--tls-version=TLSv1.1,TLSv1.2`](connection-options.md#option_general_tls-version).
  - Similarly, connection attempts fail for replicas
    configured with `MASTER_TLS_VERSION =
    'TLSv1.1,TLSv1.2'`.

MySQL permits specifying a list of protocols to support. This
list is passed directly down to the underlying SSL library and
is ultimately up to that library what protocols it actually
enables from the supplied list. Please refer to the MySQL source
code and the OpenSSL
[`SSL_CTX_new()`](https://www.openssl.org/docs/man1.1.0/ssl/SSL_CTX_new.html)
documentation for information about how the SSL library handles
this.

#### Monitoring Current Client Session TLS Protocol and Cipher

To determine which encryption TLS protocol and cipher the
current client session uses, check the session values of the
[`Ssl_version`](server-status-variables.md#statvar_Ssl_version) and
[`Ssl_cipher`](server-status-variables.md#statvar_Ssl_cipher) status variables:

```sql
mysql> SELECT * FROM performance_schema.session_status
       WHERE VARIABLE_NAME IN ('Ssl_version','Ssl_cipher');
+---------------+---------------------------+
| VARIABLE_NAME | VARIABLE_VALUE            |
+---------------+---------------------------+
| Ssl_cipher    | DHE-RSA-AES128-GCM-SHA256 |
| Ssl_version   | TLSv1.2                   |
+---------------+---------------------------+
```

If the connection is not encrypted, both variables have an empty
value.
