#### 30.4.3.38 The statements\_with\_runtimes\_in\_95th\_percentile and x$statements\_with\_runtimes\_in\_95th\_percentile Views

These views list statements with runtimes in the 95th
percentile. By default, rows are sorted by descending average
latency.

Both views use two helper views,
`x$ps_digest_avg_latency_distribution` and
`x$ps_digest_95th_percentile_by_avg_us`.
