#### 7.4.4.5 Binary Log Transaction Compression

Beginning with MySQL 8.0.20, you can enable binary log
transaction compression on a MySQL server instance. When binary
log transaction compression is enabled, transaction payloads are
compressed using the zstd algorithm, and then written to the
server's binary log file as a single event (a
`Transaction_payload_event`).

Compressed transaction payloads remain in a compressed state
while they are sent in the replication stream to replicas, other
Group Replication group members, or clients such as
[**mysqlbinlog**](mysqlbinlog.md "6.6.9 mysqlbinlog — Utility for Processing Binary Log Files"). They are not decompressed by
receiver threads, and are written to the relay log still in
their compressed state. Binary log transaction compression
therefore saves storage space both on the originator of the
transaction and on the recipient (and for their backups), and
saves network bandwidth when the transactions are sent between
server instances.

Compressed transaction payloads are decompressed when the
individual events contained in them need to be inspected. For
example, the `Transaction_payload_event` is
decompressed by an applier thread in order to apply the events
it contains on the recipient. Decompression is also carried out
during recovery, by [**mysqlbinlog**](mysqlbinlog.md "6.6.9 mysqlbinlog — Utility for Processing Binary Log Files") when
replaying transactions, and by the [`SHOW
BINLOG EVENTS`](show-binlog-events.md "15.7.7.2 SHOW BINLOG EVENTS Statement") and [`SHOW RELAYLOG
EVENTS`](show-relaylog-events.md "15.7.7.32 SHOW RELAYLOG EVENTS Statement") statements.

You can enable binary log transaction compression on a MySQL
server instance using the
[`binlog_transaction_compression`](replication-options-binary-log.md#sysvar_binlog_transaction_compression)
system variable, which defaults to `OFF`. You
can also use the
[`binlog_transaction_compression_level_zstd`](replication-options-binary-log.md#sysvar_binlog_transaction_compression_level_zstd)
system variable to set the level for the zstd algorithm that is
used for compression. This value determines the compression
effort, from 1 (the lowest effort) to 22 (the highest effort).
As the compression level increases, the compression ratio
increases, which reduces the storage space and network bandwidth
required for the transaction payload. However, the effort
required for data compression also increases, taking time and
CPU and memory resources on the originating server. Increases in
the compression effort do not have a linear relationship to
increases in the compression ratio.

Setting
[`binlog_transaction_compression`](replication-options-binary-log.md#sysvar_binlog_transaction_compression)
or
[`binlog_transaction_compression_level_zstd`](replication-options-binary-log.md#sysvar_binlog_transaction_compression_level_zstd)
(or both) has no immediate effect but rather applies to all
subsequent [`START REPLICA`](start-replica.md "15.4.2.6 START REPLICA Statement")
([`START SLAVE`](start-slave.md "15.4.2.7 START SLAVE Statement")) statements.

In NDB 8.0.31 and later, you can enable binary logging of
compressed transactions for tables using the
`NDB` storage engine at run time using the
[`ndb_log_transaction_compression`](mysql-cluster-options-variables.md#sysvar_ndb_log_transaction_compression)
system variable introduced in that release, and control the
level of compression using
[`ndb_log_transaction_compression_level_zstd`](mysql-cluster-options-variables.md#sysvar_ndb_log_transaction_compression_level_zstd).
Starting [**mysqld**](mysqld.md "6.3.1 mysqld — The MySQL Server") with
`--binlog-transaction-compression` on the command
line or in a `my.cnf` file causes
`ndb_log_transaction_compression` to be enabled
automatically and any setting for the
`--ndb-log-transaction-compression` option to be
ignored; to disable binary log transaction compression for the
`NDB` storage engine *only*,
set `ndb_log_transaction_compression=OFF` in a
client session after starting [**mysqld**](mysqld.md "6.3.1 mysqld — The MySQL Server").

(*Prior to NDB 8.0.31*: Binary log
transaction compression can be enabled in NDB Cluster, but only
when starting the server using the
--binlog-transaction-compression option (and possibly
--binlog-transaction-compression-level-zstd as well); changing
the value of either or both of the system variables
[`binlog_transaction_compression`](replication-options-binary-log.md#sysvar_binlog_transaction_compression)
and
[`binlog_transaction_compression_level_zstd`](replication-options-binary-log.md#sysvar_binlog_transaction_compression_level_zstd)
at run time has no effect on the logging of
[`NDB`](mysql-cluster.md "Chapter 25 MySQL NDB Cluster 8.0") tables.)

The following types of event are excluded from binary log
transaction compression, so are always written uncompressed to
the binary log:

- Events relating to the GTID for the transaction (including
  anonymous GTID events).
- Other types of control event, such as view change events and
  heartbeat events.
- Incident events and the whole of any transactions that
  contain them.
- Non-transactional events and the whole of any transactions
  that contain them. A transaction involving a mix of
  non-transactional and transactional storage engines does not
  have its payload compressed.
- Events that are logged using statement-based binary logging.
  Binary log transaction compression is only applied for the
  row-based binary logging format.

Binary log encryption can be used on binary log files that
contain compressed transactions.

##### 7.4.4.5.1 Behaviors When Binary Log Transaction Compression is Enabled

Transactions with payloads that are compressed can be rolled
back like any other transaction, and they can also be filtered
out on a replica by the usual filtering options. Binary log
transaction compression can be applied to XA transactions.

When binary log transaction compression is enabled, the
[`max_allowed_packet`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_max_allowed_packet) and
[`replica_max_allowed_packet`](replication-options-replica.md#sysvar_replica_max_allowed_packet) or
[`slave_max_allowed_packet`](replication-options-replica.md#sysvar_slave_max_allowed_packet)
limits for the server still apply, and are measured on the
compressed size of the
`Transaction_payload_event`, plus the bytes
used for the event header.

Important

Compressed transaction payloads are sent as a single packet,
rather than each event of the transaction being sent in an
individual packet, as is the case when binary log
transaction compression is not in use. If your replication
topology handles large transactions, be aware that a large
transaction which can be replicated successfully when binary
log transaction compression is not in use, might stop
replication due to its size when binary log transaction
compression is in use.

For multithreaded workers, each transaction (including its
GTID event and `Transaction_payload_event`)
is assigned to a worker thread. The worker thread decompresses
the transaction payload and applies the individual events in
it one by one. If an error is found applying any event within
the `Transaction_payload_event`, the complete
transaction is reported to the co-ordinator as having failed.
When [`replica_parallel_type`](replication-options-replica.md#sysvar_replica_parallel_type) or
[`slave_parallel_type`](replication-options-replica.md#sysvar_slave_parallel_type) is set to
`DATABASE`, all the databases affected by the
transaction are mapped before the transaction is scheduled.
The use of binary log transaction compression with the
`DATABASE` policy can reduce parallelism
compared to uncompressed transactions, which are mapped and
scheduled for each event.

For semisynchronous replication (see
[Section 19.4.10, “Semisynchronous Replication”](replication-semisync.md "19.4.10 Semisynchronous Replication")), the replica
acknowledges the transaction when the complete
`Transaction_payload_event` has been
received.

When binary log checksums are enabled (which is the default),
the replication source server does not write checksums for
individual events in a compressed transaction payload.
Instead, a checksum is written for the complete
`Transaction_payload_event`, and individual
checksums are written for any events that were not compressed,
such as events relating to GTIDs.

For the [`SHOW BINLOG EVENTS`](show-binlog-events.md "15.7.7.2 SHOW BINLOG EVENTS Statement") and
[`SHOW RELAYLOG EVENTS`](show-relaylog-events.md "15.7.7.32 SHOW RELAYLOG EVENTS Statement")
statements, the `Transaction_payload_event`
is first printed as a single unit, then it is unpacked and
each event inside it is printed.

For operations that reference the end position of an event,
such as [`START
REPLICA`](start-replica.md "15.4.2.6 START REPLICA Statement") (or before MySQL 8.0.22,
[`START
SLAVE`](start-slave.md "15.4.2.7 START SLAVE Statement")) with the `UNTIL` clause,
[`SOURCE_POS_WAIT()`](replication-functions-synchronization.md#function_source-pos-wait) or
[`MASTER_POS_WAIT()`](replication-functions-synchronization.md#function_master-pos-wait), and
[`sql_replica_skip_counter`](replication-options-replica.md#sysvar_sql_replica_skip_counter) or
[`sql_slave_skip_counter`](replication-options-replica.md#sysvar_sql_slave_skip_counter), you
must specify the end position of the compressed transaction
payload (the `Transaction_payload_event`).
When skipping events using
[`sql_replica_skip_counter`](replication-options-replica.md#sysvar_sql_replica_skip_counter) or
[`sql_slave_skip_counter`](replication-options-replica.md#sysvar_sql_slave_skip_counter), a
compressed transaction payload is counted as a single counter
value, so all the events inside it are skipped as a unit.

##### 7.4.4.5.2 Combining Compressed and Uncompressed Transaction Payloads

MySQL Server releases that support binary log transaction
compression can handle a mix of compressed and uncompressed
transaction payloads.

- The system variables relating to binary log transaction
  compression do not need to be set the same on all Group
  Replication group members, and are not replicated from
  sources to replicas in a replication topology. You can
  decide whether or not binary log transaction compression
  is appropriate for each MySQL Server instance that has a
  binary log.
- If transaction compression is enabled then disabled on a
  server, compression is not applied to future transactions
  originated on that server, but transaction payloads that
  have been compressed can still be handled and displayed.
- If transaction compression is specified for individual
  sessions by setting the session value of
  [`binlog_transaction_compression`](replication-options-binary-log.md#sysvar_binlog_transaction_compression),
  the binary log can contain a mix of compressed and
  uncompressed transaction payloads.

When a source in a replication topology and its replica both
have binary log transaction compression enabled, the replica
receives compressed transaction payloads and writes them
compressed to its relay log. It decompresses the transaction
payloads to apply the transactions, and then compresses them
again after applying for writing to its binary log. Any
downstream replicas receive the compressed transaction
payloads.

When a source in a replication topology has binary log
transaction compression enabled but its replica does not, the
replica receives compressed transaction payloads and writes
them compressed to its relay log. It decompresses the
transaction payloads to apply the transactions, and then
writes them uncompressed to its own binary log, if it has one.
Any downstream replicas receive the uncompressed transaction
payloads.

When a source in a replication topology does not have binary
log transaction compression enabled but its replica does, if
the replica has a binary log, it compresses the transaction
payloads after applying them, and writes the compressed
transaction payloads to its binary log. Any downstream
replicas receive the compressed transaction payloads.

When a MySQL server instance has no binary log, if it is at a
release from MySQL 8.0.20, it can receive, handle, and display
compressed transaction payloads regardless of its value for
[`binlog_transaction_compression`](replication-options-binary-log.md#sysvar_binlog_transaction_compression).
Compressed transaction payloads received by such server
instances are written in their compressed state to the relay
log, so they benefit indirectly from compression that was
carried out by other servers in the replication topology.

A replica at a release before MySQL 8.0.20 cannot replicate
from a source with binary log transaction compression enabled.
A replica at or above MySQL 8.0.20 can replicate from a source
at an earlier release that does not support binary log
transaction compression, and can carry out its own compression
on transactions received from that source when writing them to
its own binary log.

##### 7.4.4.5.3 Monitoring Binary Log Transaction Compression

You can monitor the effects of binary log transaction
compression using the Performance Schema table
[`binary_log_transaction_compression_stats`](performance-schema-binary-log-transaction-compression-stats-table.md "29.12.11.1 The binary_log_transaction_compression_stats Table").
The statistics include the data compression ratio for the
monitored period, and you can also view the effect of
compression on the last transaction on the server. You can
reset the statistics by truncating the table. Statistics for
binary logs and relay logs are split out so you can see the
impact of compression for each log type. The MySQL server
instance must have a binary log to produce these statistics.

The Performance Schema table
[`events_stages_current`](performance-schema-events-stages-current-table.md "29.12.5.1 The events_stages_current Table") shows when
a transaction is in the stage of decompression or compression
for its transaction payload, and displays its progress for
this stage. Compression is carried out by the worker thread
handling the transaction, just before the transaction is
committed, provided that there are no events in the finalized
capture cache that exclude the transaction from binary log
transaction compression (for example, incident events). When
decompression is required, it is carried out for one event
from the payload at a time.

[**mysqlbinlog**](mysqlbinlog.md "6.6.9 mysqlbinlog — Utility for Processing Binary Log Files") with the
[`--verbose`](mysqlbinlog.md#option_mysqlbinlog_verbose) option includes
comments stating the compressed size and the uncompressed size
for compressed transaction payloads, and the compression
algorithm that was used.

You can enable connection compression at the protocol level
for replication connections, using the
`SOURCE_COMPRESSION_ALGORITHMS` |
`MASTER_COMPRESSION_ALGORITHMS` and
`SOURCE_ZSTD_COMPRESSION_LEVEL` |
`MASTER_ZSTD_COMPRESSION_LEVEL`options of the
[`CHANGE REPLICATION SOURCE TO`](change-replication-source-to.md "15.4.2.3 CHANGE REPLICATION SOURCE TO Statement")
statement (from MySQL 8.0.23) or [`CHANGE
MASTER TO`](change-master-to.md "15.4.2.1 CHANGE MASTER TO Statement") statement (before MySQL 8.0.23), or the
[`replica_compressed_protocol`](replication-options-replica.md#sysvar_replica_compressed_protocol)
or [`slave_compressed_protocol`](replication-options-replica.md#sysvar_slave_compressed_protocol)
system variable. If you enable binary log transaction
compression in a system where connection compression is also
enabled, the impact of connection compression is reduced, as
there might be little opportunity to further compress the
compressed transaction payloads. However, connection
compression can still operate on uncompressed events and on
message headers. Binary log transaction compression can be
enabled in combination with connection compression if you need
to save storage space as well as network bandwidth. For more
information on connection compression for replication
connections, see
[Section 6.2.8, “Connection Compression Control”](connection-compression-control.md "6.2.8 Connection Compression Control").

For Group Replication, compression is enabled by default for
messages that exceed the threshold set by the
[`group_replication_compression_threshold`](group-replication-system-variables.md#sysvar_group_replication_compression_threshold)
system variable. You can also configure compression for
messages sent for distributed recovery by the method of state
transfer from a donor's binary log, using the
[`group_replication_recovery_compression_algorithms`](group-replication-system-variables.md#sysvar_group_replication_recovery_compression_algorithms)
and
[`group_replication_recovery_zstd_compression_level`](group-replication-system-variables.md#sysvar_group_replication_recovery_zstd_compression_level)
system variables. If you enable binary log transaction
compression in a system where these are configured, Group
Replication's message compression can still operate on
uncompressed events and on message headers, but its impact is
reduced. For more information on message compression for Group
Replication, see
[Section 20.7.4, “Message Compression”](group-replication-message-compression.md "20.7.4 Message Compression").
