After downloading the MySQL package that suits your needs and
before attempting to install it, make sure that it is intact and
has not been tampered with. There are three means of integrity
checking:

- MD5 checksums
- Cryptographic signatures using `GnuPG`, the
  GNU Privacy Guard
- For RPM packages, the built-in RPM integrity verification
  mechanism

The following sections describe how to use these methods.

If you notice that the MD5 checksum or GPG signatures do not
match, first try to download the respective package one more time,
perhaps from another mirror site.
