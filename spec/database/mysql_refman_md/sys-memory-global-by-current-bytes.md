#### 30.4.3.19 The memory\_global\_by\_current\_bytes and x$memory\_global\_by\_current\_bytes Views

These views summarize memory use, grouped by allocation type
(that is, by event). By default, rows are sorted by descending
amount of memory used.

The
[`memory_global_by_current_bytes`](sys-memory-global-by-current-bytes.md "30.4.3.19 The memory_global_by_current_bytes and x$memory_global_by_current_bytes Views")
and
[`x$memory_global_by_current_bytes`](sys-memory-global-by-current-bytes.md "30.4.3.19 The memory_global_by_current_bytes and x$memory_global_by_current_bytes Views")
views have these columns:

- `event_name`

  The memory event name.
- `current_count`

  The total number of occurrences of the event.
- `current_alloc`

  The current number of allocated bytes that have not been
  freed yet for the event.
- `current_avg_alloc`

  The current number of allocated bytes per memory block for
  the event.
- `high_count`

  The high-water mark for number of memory blocks allocated
  for the event.
- `high_alloc`

  The high-water mark for number of bytes allocated for the
  event.
- `high_avg_alloc`

  The high-water mark for average number of bytes per memory
  block allocated for the event.
