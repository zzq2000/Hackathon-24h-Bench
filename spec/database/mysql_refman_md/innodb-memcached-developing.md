Typically, writing an application for the
`InnoDB` **memcached** plugin
involves some degree of rewriting or adapting existing code that
uses MySQL or the **memcached** API.

- With the `daemon_memcached` plugin, instead
  of many traditional **memcached** servers
  running on low-powered machines, you have the same number of
  **memcached** servers as MySQL servers, running
  on relatively high-powered machines with substantial disk
  storage and memory. You might reuse some existing code that
  works with the **memcached** API, but
  adaptation is likely required due to the different server
  configuration.
- The data stored through the
  `daemon_memcached` plugin goes into
  [`VARCHAR`](char.md "13.3.2 The CHAR and VARCHAR Types"),
  [`TEXT`](blob.md "13.3.4 The BLOB and TEXT Types"), or
  [`BLOB`](blob.md "13.3.4 The BLOB and TEXT Types") columns, and must be
  converted to do numeric operations. You can perform the
  conversion on the application side, or by using the
  `CAST()` function in queries.
- Coming from a database background, you might be used to
  general-purpose SQL tables with many columns. The tables
  accessed by **memcached** code likely have only
  a few or even a single column holding data values.
- You might adapt parts of your application that perform
  single-row queries, inserts, updates, or deletes, to improve
  performance in critical sections of code. Both
  [queries](glossary.md#glos_query "query") (read) and
  [DML](glossary.md#glos_dml "DML") (write) operations can be
  substantially faster when performed through the
  `InnoDB` **memcached**
  interface. The performance improvement for writes is typically
  greater than the performance improvement for reads, so you
  might focus on adapting code that performs logging or records
  interactive choices on a website.

The following sections explore these points in more detail.
