#### 19.3.2.1 Scope of Binary Log Encryption

When binary log encryption is active for a MySQL server
instance, the encryption coverage is as follows:

- Data at rest that is written to the binary log files and
  relay log files is encrypted from the point in time where
  encryption is started, using the two tier encryption
  architecture described above. Existing binary log files and
  relay log files that were present on the server when you
  started encryption are not encrypted. You can purge these
  files when they are no longer needed.
- Data in motion in the replication event stream, which is
  sent to MySQL clients including
  [**mysqlbinlog**](mysqlbinlog.md "6.6.9 mysqlbinlog — Utility for Processing Binary Log Files"), is decrypted for
  transmission, and should therefore be protected in transit
  by the use of connection encryption (see
  [Section 8.3, “Using Encrypted Connections”](encrypted-connections.md "8.3 Using Encrypted Connections") and
  [Section 19.3.1, “Setting Up Replication to Use Encrypted Connections”](replication-encrypted-connections.md "19.3.1 Setting Up Replication to Use Encrypted Connections")).
- Data in use that is held in the binary log transaction and
  statement caches during a transaction is in unencrypted
  format in the memory buffer that stores the cache. The data
  is written to a temporary file on disk if it exceeds the
  space available in the memory buffer. From MySQL 8.0.17,
  when binary log encryption is active on the server,
  temporary files used to hold the binary log cache are
  encrypted using AES-CTR (AES Counter mode) for stream
  encryption. Because the temporary files are volatile and
  tied to a single process, they are encrypted using
  single-tier encryption, using a randomly generated file
  password and initialization vector that exist only in memory
  and are never stored on disk or in the keyring. After each
  transaction is committed, the binary log cache is reset: the
  memory buffer is cleared, any temporary file used to hold
  the binary log cache is truncated, and a new file password
  and initialization vector are randomly generated for use
  with the next transaction. This reset also takes place when
  the server is restarted after a normal shutdown or an
  unexpected halt.

Note

If you use [`LOAD DATA`](load-data.md "15.2.9 LOAD DATA Statement") when
[`binlog_format=STATEMENT`](replication-options-binary-log.md#sysvar_binlog_format) is
set, which is not recommended as the statement is considered
unsafe for statement-based replication, a temporary file
containing the data is created on the replica where the
changes are applied. These temporary files are not encrypted
when binary log encryption is active on the server. Use
row-based or mixed binary logging format instead, which do not
create the temporary files.
