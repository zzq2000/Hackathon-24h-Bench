## 3.1 Before You Begin

Review the information in this section before upgrading. Perform
any recommended actions.

- Understand what may occur during an upgrade. See
  [Section 3.4, “What the MySQL Upgrade Process Upgrades”](upgrading-what-is-upgraded.md "3.4 What the MySQL Upgrade Process Upgrades").
- Protect your data by creating a backup. The backup should
  include the `mysql` system database, which
  contains the MySQL data dictionary tables and system tables.
  See [Section 9.2, “Database Backup Methods”](backup-methods.md "9.2 Database Backup Methods").

  Important

  Downgrade from MySQL 8.0 to MySQL
  5.7, or from a MySQL 8.0 release
  to a previous MySQL 8.0 release, is not
  supported. The only supported alternative is to restore a
  backup taken *before* upgrading. It is
  therefore imperative that you back up your data before
  starting the upgrade process.
- Review [Section 3.2, “Upgrade Paths”](upgrade-paths.md "3.2 Upgrade Paths") to ensure that your
  intended upgrade path is supported.
- Review [Section 3.5, “Changes in MySQL 8.0”](upgrading-from-previous-series.md "3.5 Changes in MySQL 8.0") for
  changes that you should be aware of before upgrading. Some
  changes may require action.
- Review [Section 1.3, “What Is New in MySQL 8.0”](mysql-nutshell.md "1.3 What Is New in MySQL 8.0") for deprecated and
  removed features. An upgrade may require changes with respect
  to those features if you use any of them.
- Review [Section 1.4, “Server and Status Variables and Options Added, Deprecated, or Removed in
  MySQL 8.0”](added-deprecated-removed.md "1.4 Server and Status Variables and Options Added, Deprecated, or Removed in MySQL 8.0"). If you use
  deprecated or removed variables, an upgrade may require
  configuration changes.
- Review the
  [Release
  Notes](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/relnotes/mysql/8.0/en/) for information about fixes, changes, and new
  features.
- If you use replication, review
  [Section 19.5.3, “Upgrading a Replication Topology”](replication-upgrade.md "19.5.3 Upgrading a Replication Topology").
- Review [Section 3.3, “Upgrade Best Practices”](upgrade-best-practices.md "3.3 Upgrade Best Practices") and plan
  accordingly.
- Upgrade procedures vary by platform and how the initial
  installation was performed. Use the procedure that applies to
  your current MySQL installation:

  - For binary and package-based installations on non-Windows
    platforms, refer to
    [Section 3.7, “Upgrading MySQL Binary or Package-based Installations on Unix/Linux”](upgrade-binary-package.md "3.7 Upgrading MySQL Binary or Package-based Installations on Unix/Linux").

    Note

    For supported Linux distributions, the preferred method
    for upgrading package-based installations is to use the
    MySQL software repositories (MySQL Yum Repository, MySQL
    APT Repository, and MySQL SLES Repository).
  - For installations on an Enterprise Linux platform or
    Fedora using the MySQL Yum Repository, refer to
    [Section 3.8, “Upgrading MySQL with the MySQL Yum Repository”](updating-yum-repo.md "3.8 Upgrading MySQL with the MySQL Yum Repository").
  - For installations on Ubuntu using the MySQL APT
    repository, refer to [Section 3.9, “Upgrading MySQL with the MySQL APT Repository”](updating-apt-repo.md "3.9 Upgrading MySQL with the MySQL APT Repository").
  - For installations on SLES using the MySQL SLES repository,
    refer to [Section 3.10, “Upgrading MySQL with the MySQL SLES Repository”](updating-sles-repo.md "3.10 Upgrading MySQL with the MySQL SLES Repository").
  - For installations performed using Docker, refer to
    [Section 3.12, “Upgrading a Docker Installation of MySQL”](upgrade-docker-mysql.md "3.12 Upgrading a Docker Installation of MySQL").
  - For installations on Windows, refer to
    [Section 3.11, “Upgrading MySQL on Windows”](windows-upgrading.md "3.11 Upgrading MySQL on Windows").
- If your MySQL installation contains a large amount of data
  that might take a long time to convert after an in-place
  upgrade, it may be useful to create a test instance for
  assessing the conversions that are required and the work
  involved to perform them. To create a test instance, make a
  copy of your MySQL instance that contains the
  `mysql` database and other databases without
  the data. Run the upgrade procedure on the test instance to
  assess the work involved to perform the actual data
  conversion.
- Rebuilding and reinstalling MySQL language interfaces is
  recommended when you install or upgrade to a new release of
  MySQL. This applies to MySQL interfaces such as PHP
  `mysql` extensions and the Perl
  `DBD::mysql` module.
