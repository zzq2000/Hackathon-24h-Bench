#### 14.18.1.3 Functions to Inspect and Configure the Maximum Consensus Instances of a Group

The following functions enable you to inspect and configure
the maximum number of consensus instances that a group can
execute in parallel.

- [`group_replication_get_write_concurrency()`](group-replication-functions-for-maximum-consensus.md#function_group-replication-get-write-concurrency)

  Check the maximum number of consensus instances that a
  group can execute in parallel.

  Syntax:

  ```clike
  INT group_replication_get_write_concurrency()
  ```

  This function has no parameters.

  Return value:

  The maximum number of consensus instances currently set
  for the group.

  Example:

  ```sql
  SELECT group_replication_get_write_concurrency()
  ```

  For more information, see
  [Section 20.5.1.3, “Using Group Replication Group Write Consensus”](group-replication-group-write-consensus.md "20.5.1.3 Using Group Replication Group Write Consensus").
- [`group_replication_set_write_concurrency()`](group-replication-functions-for-maximum-consensus.md#function_group-replication-set-write-concurrency)

  Configures the maximum number of consensus instances that
  a group can execute in parallel. The
  [`GROUP_REPLICATION_ADMIN`](privileges-provided.md#priv_group-replication-admin)
  privilege is required to use this function.

  Syntax:

  ```clike
  STRING group_replication_set_write_concurrency(instances)
  ```

  Arguments:

  - *`members`*: Sets the maximum
    number of consensus instances that a group can execute
    in parallel. Default value is 10, valid values are
    integers in the range of 10 to 200.

  Return value:

  Any resulting error as a string.

  Example:

  ```sql
  SELECT group_replication_set_write_concurrency(instances);
  ```

  For more information, see
  [Section 20.5.1.3, “Using Group Replication Group Write Consensus”](group-replication-group-write-consensus.md "20.5.1.3 Using Group Replication Group Write Consensus").
