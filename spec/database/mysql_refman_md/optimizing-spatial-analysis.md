### 13.4.9 Optimizing Spatial Analysis

For [`MyISAM`](myisam-storage-engine.md "18.2 The MyISAM Storage Engine") and
`InnoDB` tables, search operations in columns
containing spatial data can be optimized using
`SPATIAL` indexes. The most typical operations
are:

- Point queries that search for all objects that contain a
  given point
- Region queries that search for all objects that overlap a
  given region

MySQL uses **R-Trees with quadratic
splitting** for `SPATIAL` indexes on
spatial columns. A `SPATIAL` index is built
using the minimum bounding rectangle (MBR) of a geometry. For
most geometries, the MBR is a minimum rectangle that surrounds
the geometries. For a horizontal or a vertical linestring, the
MBR is a rectangle degenerated into the linestring. For a point,
the MBR is a rectangle degenerated into the point.

It is also possible to create normal indexes on spatial columns.
In a non-`SPATIAL` index, you must declare a
prefix for any spatial column except for
`POINT` columns.

`MyISAM` and `InnoDB` support
both `SPATIAL` and
non-`SPATIAL` indexes. Other storage engines
support non-`SPATIAL` indexes, as described in
[Section 15.1.15, “CREATE INDEX Statement”](create-index.md "15.1.15 CREATE INDEX Statement").
