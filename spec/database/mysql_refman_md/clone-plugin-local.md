#### 7.6.7.2 Cloning Data Locally

The clone plugin supports the following syntax for cloning data
locally; that is, cloning data from the local MySQL data
directory to another directory on the same server or node where
the MySQL server instance runs:

```sql
CLONE LOCAL DATA DIRECTORY [=] 'clone_dir';
```

To use [`CLONE`](clone.md "15.7.5 CLONE Statement") syntax, the clone
plugin must be installed. For installation instructions, see
[Section 7.6.7.1, “Installing the Clone Plugin”](clone-plugin-installation.md "7.6.7.1 Installing the Clone Plugin").

The [`BACKUP_ADMIN`](privileges-provided.md#priv_backup-admin) privilege is
required to execute [`CLONE
LOCAL DATA DIRECTORY`](clone.md "15.7.5 CLONE Statement") statements.

```sql
mysql> GRANT BACKUP_ADMIN ON *.* TO 'clone_user';
```

where `clone_user`
is the MySQL user that performs the cloning operation. The user
you select to perform the cloning operation can be any MySQL
user with the [`BACKUP_ADMIN`](privileges-provided.md#priv_backup-admin)
privilege on \*.\*.

The following example demonstrates cloning data locally:

```sql
mysql> CLONE LOCAL DATA DIRECTORY = '/path/to/clone_dir';
```

where *`/path/to/clone_dir`* is the full
path of the local directory that data is cloned to. An absolute
path is required, and the specified directory
(“*`clone_dir`*”) must not
exist, but the specified path must be an existent path. The
MySQL server must have the necessary write access to create the
directory.

Note

A local cloning operation does not support cloning of
user-created tables or tablespaces that reside outside of the
data directory. Attempting to clone such tables or tablespaces
causes the following error: ERROR 1086 (HY000):
File '*`/path/to/tablespace_name.ibd`*'
already exists. Cloning a tablespace with the same
path as the source tablespace would cause a conflict and is
therefore prohibited.

All other user-created `InnoDB` tables and
tablespaces, the `InnoDB` system tablespace,
redo logs, and undo tablespaces are cloned to the specified
directory.

If desired, you can start the MySQL server on the cloned
directory after the cloning operation is complete.

```terminal
$> mysqld_safe --datadir=clone_dir
```

where *`clone_dir`* is the directory that
data was cloned to.

For information about monitoring cloning operation status and
progress, see [Section 7.6.7.10, “Monitoring Cloning Operations”](clone-plugin-monitoring.md "7.6.7.10 Monitoring Cloning Operations").
