### 8.2.22 Troubleshooting Problems Connecting to MySQL

If you encounter problems when you try to connect to the MySQL
server, the following items describe some courses of action you
can take to correct the problem.

- Make sure that the server is running. If it is not, clients
  cannot connect to it. For example, if an attempt to connect to
  the server fails with a message such as one of those
  following, one cause might be that the server is not running:

  ```terminal
  $> mysql
  ERROR 2003: Can't connect to MySQL server on 'host_name' (111)
  $> mysql
  ERROR 2002: Can't connect to local MySQL server through socket
  '/tmp/mysql.sock' (111)
  ```
- It might be that the server is running, but you are trying to
  connect using a TCP/IP port, named pipe, or Unix socket file
  different from the one on which the server is listening. To
  correct this when you invoke a client program, specify a
  [`--port`](connection-options.md#option_general_port) option to indicate the
  proper port number, or a
  [`--socket`](connection-options.md#option_general_socket) option to indicate
  the proper named pipe or Unix socket file. To find out where
  the socket file is, you can use this command:

  ```terminal
  $> netstat -ln | grep mysql
  ```
- Make sure that the server has not been configured to ignore
  network connections or (if you are attempting to connect
  remotely) that it has not been configured to listen only
  locally on its network interfaces. If the server was started
  with the [`skip_networking`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_skip_networking)
  system variable enabled, no TCP/IP connections are accepted.
  If the server was started with the
  [`bind_address`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_bind_address) system variable
  set to `127.0.0.1`, it listens for TCP/IP
  connections only locally on the loopback interface and does
  not accept remote connections.
- Check to make sure that there is no firewall blocking access
  to MySQL. Your firewall may be configured on the basis of the
  application being executed, or the port number used by MySQL
  for communication (3306 by default). Under Linux or Unix,
  check your IP tables (or similar) configuration to ensure that
  the port has not been blocked. Under Windows, applications
  such as ZoneAlarm or Windows Firewall may need to be
  configured not to block the MySQL port.
- The grant tables must be properly set up so that the server
  can use them for access control. For some distribution types
  (such as binary distributions on Windows, or RPM and DEB
  distributions on Linux), the installation process initializes
  the MySQL data directory, including the
  `mysql` system database containing the grant
  tables. For distributions that do not do this, you must
  initialize the data directory manually. For details, see
  [Section 2.9, “Postinstallation Setup and Testing”](postinstallation.md "2.9 Postinstallation Setup and Testing").

  To determine whether you need to initialize the grant tables,
  look for a `mysql` directory under the data
  directory. (The data directory normally is named
  `data` or `var` and is
  located under your MySQL installation directory.) Make sure
  that you have a file named `user.MYD` in
  the `mysql` database directory. If not,
  initialize the data directory. After doing so and starting the
  server, you should be able to connect to the server.
- After a fresh installation, if you try to log on to the server
  as `root` without using a password, you might
  get the following error message.

  ```terminal
  $> mysql -u root
  ERROR 1045 (28000): Access denied for user 'root'@'localhost' (using password: NO)
  ```

  It means a root password has already been assigned during
  installation and it has to be supplied. See
  [Section 2.9.4, “Securing the Initial MySQL Account”](default-privileges.md "2.9.4 Securing the Initial MySQL Account") on the different ways the
  password could have been assigned and, in some cases, how to
  find it. If you need to reset the root password, see
  instructions in [Section B.3.3.2, “How to Reset the Root Password”](resetting-permissions.md "B.3.3.2 How to Reset the Root Password"). After
  you have found or reset your password, log on again as
  `root` using the
  [`--password`](connection-options.md#option_general_password) (or
  [`-p`](connection-options.md#option_general_password))
  option:

  ```terminal
  $> mysql -u root -p
  Enter password:
  ```

  However, the server is going to let you connect as
  `root` without using a password if you have
  initialized MySQL using [**mysqld
  --initialize-insecure**](mysqld.md "6.3.1 mysqld — The MySQL Server") (see
  [Section 2.9.1, “Initializing the Data Directory”](data-directory-initialization.md "2.9.1 Initializing the Data Directory") for details).
  That is a security risk, so you should set a password for the
  `root` account; see
  [Section 2.9.4, “Securing the Initial MySQL Account”](default-privileges.md "2.9.4 Securing the Initial MySQL Account") for instructions.
- If you have updated an existing MySQL installation to a newer
  version, did you perform the MySQL upgrade procedure? If not,
  do so. The structure of the grant tables changes occasionally
  when new capabilities are added, so after an upgrade you
  should always make sure that your tables have the current
  structure. For instructions, see [Chapter 3, *Upgrading MySQL*](upgrading.md "Chapter 3 Upgrading MySQL").
- If a client program receives the following error message when
  it tries to connect, it means that the server expects
  passwords in a newer format than the client is capable of
  generating:

  ```terminal
  $> mysql
  Client does not support authentication protocol requested
  by server; consider upgrading MySQL client
  ```
- Remember that client programs use connection parameters
  specified in option files or environment variables. If a
  client program seems to be sending incorrect default
  connection parameters when you have not specified them on the
  command line, check any applicable option files and your
  environment. For example, if you get `Access
  denied` when you run a client without any options,
  make sure that you have not specified an old password in any
  of your option files!

  You can suppress the use of option files by a client program
  by invoking it with the
  [`--no-defaults`](option-file-options.md#option_general_no-defaults) option. For
  example:

  ```terminal
  $> mysqladmin --no-defaults -u root version
  ```

  The option files that clients use are listed in
  [Section 6.2.2.2, “Using Option Files”](option-files.md "6.2.2.2 Using Option Files"). Environment variables are
  listed in [Section 6.9, “Environment Variables”](environment-variables.md "6.9 Environment Variables").
- If you get the following error, it means that you are using an
  incorrect `root` password:

  ```terminal
  $> mysqladmin -u root -pxxxx ver
  Access denied for user 'root'@'localhost' (using password: YES)
  ```

  If the preceding error occurs even when you have not specified
  a password, it means that you have an incorrect password
  listed in some option file. Try the
  [`--no-defaults`](option-file-options.md#option_general_no-defaults) option as
  described in the previous item.

  For information on changing passwords, see
  [Section 8.2.14, “Assigning Account Passwords”](assigning-passwords.md "8.2.14 Assigning Account Passwords").

  If you have lost or forgotten the `root`
  password, see [Section B.3.3.2, “How to Reset the Root Password”](resetting-permissions.md "B.3.3.2 How to Reset the Root Password").
- `localhost` is a synonym for your local host
  name, and is also the default host to which clients try to
  connect if you specify no host explicitly.

  You can use a [`--host=127.0.0.1`](connection-options.md#option_general_host)
  option to name the server host explicitly. This causes a
  TCP/IP connection to the local [**mysqld**](mysqld.md "6.3.1 mysqld — The MySQL Server")
  server. You can also use TCP/IP by specifying a
  [`--host`](connection-options.md#option_general_host) option that uses the
  actual host name of the local host. In this case, the host
  name must be specified in a `user` table row
  on the server host, even though you are running the client
  program on the same host as the server.
- The `Access denied` error message tells you
  who you are trying to log in as, the client host from which
  you are trying to connect, and whether you were using a
  password. Normally, you should have one row in the
  `user` table that exactly matches the host
  name and user name that were given in the error message. For
  example, if you get an error message that contains
  `using password: NO`, it means that you tried
  to log in without a password.
- If you get an `Access denied` error when
  trying to connect to the database with `mysql -u
  user_name`, you may have a
  problem with the `user` table. Check this by
  executing `mysql -u root mysql` and issuing
  this SQL statement:

  ```sql
  SELECT * FROM user;
  ```

  The result should include a row with the
  `Host` and `User` columns
  matching your client's host name and your MySQL user name.
- If the following error occurs when you try to connect from a
  host other than the one on which the MySQL server is running,
  it means that there is no row in the `user`
  table with a `Host` value that matches the
  client host:

  ```none
  Host ... is not allowed to connect to this MySQL server
  ```

  You can fix this by setting up an account for the combination
  of client host name and user name that you are using when
  trying to connect.

  If you do not know the IP address or host name of the machine
  from which you are connecting, you should put a row with
  `'%'` as the `Host` column
  value in the `user` table. After trying to
  connect from the client machine, use a `SELECT
  USER()` query to see how you really did connect. Then
  change the `'%'` in the
  `user` table row to the actual host name that
  shows up in the log. Otherwise, your system is left insecure
  because it permits connections from any host for the given
  user name.

  On Linux, another reason that this error might occur is that
  you are using a binary MySQL version that is compiled with a
  different version of the `glibc` library than
  the one you are using. In this case, you should either upgrade
  your operating system or `glibc`, or download
  a source distribution of MySQL version and compile it
  yourself. A source RPM is normally trivial to compile and
  install, so this is not a big problem.
- If you specify a host name when trying to connect, but get an
  error message where the host name is not shown or is an IP
  address, it means that the MySQL server got an error when
  trying to resolve the IP address of the client host to a name:

  ```terminal
  $> mysqladmin -u root -pxxxx -h some_hostname ver
  Access denied for user 'root'@'' (using password: YES)
  ```

  If you try to connect as `root` and get the
  following error, it means that you do not have a row in the
  `user` table with a `User`
  column value of `'root'` and that
  [**mysqld**](mysqld.md "6.3.1 mysqld — The MySQL Server") cannot resolve the host name for
  your client:

  ```none
  Access denied for user ''@'unknown'
  ```

  These errors indicate a DNS problem. To fix it, execute
  [**mysqladmin flush-hosts**](mysqladmin.md "6.5.2 mysqladmin — A MySQL Server Administration Program") to reset the
  internal DNS host cache. See [Section 7.1.12.3, “DNS Lookups and the Host Cache”](host-cache.md "7.1.12.3 DNS Lookups and the Host Cache").

  Some permanent solutions are:

  - Determine what is wrong with your DNS server and fix it.
  - Specify IP addresses rather than host names in the MySQL
    grant tables.
  - Put an entry for the client machine name in
    `/etc/hosts` on Unix or
    `\windows\hosts` on Windows.
  - Start [**mysqld**](mysqld.md "6.3.1 mysqld — The MySQL Server") with the
    [`skip_name_resolve`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_skip_name_resolve) system
    variable enabled.
  - Start [**mysqld**](mysqld.md "6.3.1 mysqld — The MySQL Server") with the
    [`--skip-host-cache`](server-options.md#option_mysqld_skip-host-cache) option.
  - On Unix, if you are running the server and the client on
    the same machine, connect to `localhost`.
    For connections to `localhost`, MySQL
    programs attempt to connect to the local server by using a
    Unix socket file, unless there are connection parameters
    specified to ensure that the client makes a TCP/IP
    connection. For more information, see
    [Section 6.2.4, “Connecting to the MySQL Server Using Command Options”](connecting.md "6.2.4 Connecting to the MySQL Server Using Command Options").
  - On Windows, if you are running the server and the client
    on the same machine and the server supports named pipe
    connections, connect to the host name `.`
    (period). Connections to `.` use a named
    pipe rather than TCP/IP.
- If `mysql -u root` works but `mysql
  -h your_hostname -u root`
  results in `Access denied` (where
  *`your_hostname`* is the actual host
  name of the local host), you may not have the correct name for
  your host in the `user` table. A common
  problem here is that the `Host` value in the
  `user` table row specifies an unqualified
  host name, but your system's name resolution routines return a
  fully qualified domain name (or vice versa). For example, if
  you have a row with host `'pluto'` in the
  `user` table, but your DNS tells MySQL that
  your host name is `'pluto.example.com'`, the
  row does not work. Try adding a row to the
  `user` table that contains the IP address of
  your host as the `Host` column value.
  (Alternatively, you could add a row to the
  `user` table with a `Host`
  value that contains a wildcard (for example,
  `'pluto.%'`). However, use of
  `Host` values ending with
  `%` is *insecure* and is
  *not* recommended!)
- If `mysql -u
  user_name` works but
  `mysql -u user_name
  some_db` does not, you
  have not granted access to the given user for the database
  named *`some_db`*.
- If `mysql -u
  user_name` works when
  executed on the server host, but `mysql -h
  host_name -u
  user_name` does not work
  when executed on a remote client host, you have not enabled
  access to the server for the given user name from the remote
  host.
- If you cannot figure out why you get `Access
  denied`, remove from the `user`
  table all rows that have `Host` values
  containing wildcards (rows that contain `'%'`
  or `'_'` characters). A very common error is
  to insert a new row with
  `Host`=`'%'` and
  `User`=`'some_user'`,
  thinking that this enables you to specify
  `localhost` to connect from the same machine.
  The reason that this does not work is that the default
  privileges include a row with
  `Host`=`'localhost'` and
  `User`=`''`. Because that
  row has a `Host` value
  `'localhost'` that is more specific than
  `'%'`, it is used in preference to the new
  row when connecting from `localhost`! The
  correct procedure is to insert a second row with
  `Host`=`'localhost'` and
  `User`=`'some_user'`,
  or to delete the row with
  `Host`=`'localhost'` and
  `User`=`''`. After deleting
  the row, remember to issue a [`FLUSH
  PRIVILEGES`](flush.md#flush-privileges) statement to reload the grant tables. See
  also [Section 8.2.6, “Access Control, Stage 1: Connection Verification”](connection-access.md "8.2.6 Access Control, Stage 1: Connection Verification").
- If you are able to connect to the MySQL server, but get an
  `Access denied` message whenever you issue a
  [`SELECT ... INTO
  OUTFILE`](select-into.md "15.2.13.1 SELECT ... INTO Statement") or [`LOAD DATA`](load-data.md "15.2.9 LOAD DATA Statement")
  statement, your row in the `user` table does
  not have the [`FILE`](privileges-provided.md#priv_file) privilege
  enabled.
- If you change the grant tables directly (for example, by using
  [`INSERT`](insert.md "15.2.7 INSERT Statement"),
  [`UPDATE`](update.md "15.2.17 UPDATE Statement"), or
  [`DELETE`](delete.md "15.2.2 DELETE Statement") statements) and your
  changes seem to be ignored, remember that you must execute a
  [`FLUSH PRIVILEGES`](flush.md#flush-privileges) statement or a
  [**mysqladmin flush-privileges**](mysqladmin.md "6.5.2 mysqladmin — A MySQL Server Administration Program") command to
  cause the server to reload the privilege tables. Otherwise,
  your changes have no effect until the next time the server is
  restarted. Remember that after you change the
  `root` password with an
  [`UPDATE`](update.md "15.2.17 UPDATE Statement") statement, you do not
  need to specify the new password until after you flush the
  privileges, because the server does not know until then that
  you have changed the password.
- If your privileges seem to have changed in the middle of a
  session, it may be that a MySQL administrator has changed
  them. Reloading the grant tables affects new client
  connections, but it also affects existing connections as
  indicated in [Section 8.2.13, “When Privilege Changes Take Effect”](privilege-changes.md "8.2.13 When Privilege Changes Take Effect").
- If you have access problems with a Perl, PHP, Python, or ODBC
  program, try to connect to the server with `mysql -u
  user_name
  db_name` or `mysql
  -u user_name
  -ppassword
  db_name`. If you are able
  to connect using the [**mysql**](mysql.md "6.5.1 mysql — The MySQL Command-Line Client") client, the
  problem lies with your program, not with the access
  privileges. (There is no space between `-p` and
  the password; you can also use the
  [`--password=password`](connection-options.md#option_general_password)
  syntax to specify the password. If you use the
  `-p` or
  [`--password`](connection-options.md#option_general_password) option with no
  password value, MySQL prompts you for the password.)
- For testing purposes, start the [**mysqld**](mysqld.md "6.3.1 mysqld — The MySQL Server")
  server with the
  [`--skip-grant-tables`](server-options.md#option_mysqld_skip-grant-tables) option.
  Then you can change the MySQL grant tables and use the
  [`SHOW GRANTS`](show-grants.md "15.7.7.21 SHOW GRANTS Statement") statement to check
  whether your modifications have the desired effect. When you
  are satisfied with your changes, execute [**mysqladmin
  flush-privileges**](mysqladmin.md "6.5.2 mysqladmin — A MySQL Server Administration Program") to tell the
  [**mysqld**](mysqld.md "6.3.1 mysqld — The MySQL Server") server to reload the privileges.
  This enables you to begin using the new grant table contents
  without stopping and restarting the server.
- If everything else fails, start the [**mysqld**](mysqld.md "6.3.1 mysqld — The MySQL Server")
  server with a debugging option (for example,
  [`--debug=d,general,query`](server-options.md#option_mysqld_debug)). This
  prints host and user information about attempted connections,
  as well as information about each command issued. See
  [Section 7.9.4, “The DBUG Package”](dbug-package.md "7.9.4 The DBUG Package").
- If you have any other problems with the MySQL grant tables and
  ask on the
  [MySQL Community
  Slack](https://mysqlcommunity.slack.com/), always provide a dump of the MySQL grant
  tables. You can dump the tables with the [**mysqldump
  mysql**](mysqldump.md "6.5.4 mysqldump — A Database Backup Program") command. To file a bug report, see the
  instructions at [Section 1.5, “How to Report Bugs or Problems”](bug-reports.md "1.5 How to Report Bugs or Problems"). In some cases,
  you may need to restart [**mysqld**](mysqld.md "6.3.1 mysqld — The MySQL Server") with
  [`--skip-grant-tables`](server-options.md#option_mysqld_skip-grant-tables) to run
  [**mysqldump**](mysqldump.md "6.5.4 mysqldump — A Database Backup Program").
