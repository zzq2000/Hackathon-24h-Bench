#### 15.2.13.1 SELECT ... INTO Statement

The [`SELECT ...
INTO`](select-into.md "15.2.13.1 SELECT ... INTO Statement") form of [`SELECT`](select.md "15.2.13 SELECT Statement")
enables a query result to be stored in variables or written to a
file:

- `SELECT ... INTO
  var_list` selects column
  values and stores them into variables.
- `SELECT ... INTO OUTFILE` writes the
  selected rows to a file. Column and line terminators can be
  specified to produce a specific output format.
- `SELECT ... INTO DUMPFILE` writes a single
  row to a file without any formatting.

A given [`SELECT`](select.md "15.2.13 SELECT Statement") statement can
contain at most one `INTO` clause, although as
shown by the [`SELECT`](select.md "15.2.13 SELECT Statement") syntax
description (see [Section 15.2.13, “SELECT Statement”](select.md "15.2.13 SELECT Statement")), the
`INTO` can appear in different positions:

- Before `FROM`. Example:

  ```sql
  SELECT * INTO @myvar FROM t1;
  ```
- Before a trailing locking clause. Example:

  ```sql
  SELECT * FROM t1 INTO @myvar FOR UPDATE;
  ```
- At the end of the [`SELECT`](select.md "15.2.13 SELECT Statement").
  Example:

  ```sql
  SELECT * FROM t1 FOR UPDATE INTO @myvar;
  ```

The `INTO` position at the end of the statement
is supported as of MySQL 8.0.20, and is the preferred position.
The position before a locking clause is deprecated as of MySQL
8.0.20; expect support for it to be removed in a future version
of MySQL. In other words, `INTO` after
`FROM` but not at the end of the
[`SELECT`](select.md "15.2.13 SELECT Statement") produces a warning.

An `INTO` clause should not be used in a nested
[`SELECT`](select.md "15.2.13 SELECT Statement") because such a
[`SELECT`](select.md "15.2.13 SELECT Statement") must return its result to
the outer context. There are also constraints on the use of
`INTO` within
[`UNION`](union.md "15.2.18 UNION Clause") statements; see
[Section 15.2.18, “UNION Clause”](union.md "15.2.18 UNION Clause").

For the `INTO
var_list` variant:

- *`var_list`* names a list of one or
  more variables, each of which can be a user-defined
  variable, stored procedure or function parameter, or stored
  program local variable. (Within a prepared `SELECT
  ... INTO var_list`
  statement, only user-defined variables are permitted; see
  [Section 15.6.4.2, “Local Variable Scope and Resolution”](local-variable-scope.md "15.6.4.2 Local Variable Scope and Resolution").)
- The selected values are assigned to the variables. The
  number of variables must match the number of columns. The
  query should return a single row. If the query returns no
  rows, a warning with error code 1329 occurs (`No
  data`), and the variable values remain unchanged.
  If the query returns multiple rows, error 1172 occurs
  (`Result consisted of more than one row`).
  If it is possible that the statement may retrieve multiple
  rows, you can use `LIMIT 1` to limit the
  result set to a single row.

  ```sql
  SELECT id, data INTO @x, @y FROM test.t1 LIMIT 1;
  ```

`INTO var_list` can
also be used with a [`TABLE`](table.md "15.2.16 TABLE Statement")
statement, subject to these restrictions:

- The number of variables must match the number of columns in
  the table.
- If the table contains more than one row, you must use
  `LIMIT 1` to limit the result set to a
  single row. `LIMIT 1` must precede the
  `INTO` keyword.

An example of such a statement is shown here:

```sql
TABLE employees ORDER BY lname DESC LIMIT 1
    INTO @id, @fname, @lname, @hired, @separated, @job_code, @store_id;
```

You can also select values from a
[`VALUES`](values.md "15.2.19 VALUES Statement") statement that generates a
single row into a set of user variables. In this case, you must
employ a table alias, and you must assign each value from the
value list to a variable. Each of the two statements shown here
is equivalent to
[`SET @x=2, @y=4,
@z=8`](set-variable.md "15.7.6.1 SET Syntax for Variable Assignment"):

```sql
SELECT * FROM (VALUES ROW(2,4,8)) AS t INTO @x,@y,@z;

SELECT * FROM (VALUES ROW(2,4,8)) AS t(a,b,c) INTO @x,@y,@z;
```

User variable names are not case-sensitive. See
[Section 11.4, “User-Defined Variables”](user-variables.md "11.4 User-Defined Variables").

The [`SELECT ... INTO
OUTFILE 'file_name'`](select-into.md "15.2.13.1 SELECT ... INTO Statement") form of
[`SELECT`](select.md "15.2.13 SELECT Statement") writes the selected rows
to a file. The file is created on the server host, so you must
have the [`FILE`](privileges-provided.md#priv_file) privilege to use
this syntax. *`file_name`* cannot be an
existing file, which among other things prevents files such as
`/etc/passwd` and database tables from being
modified. The
[`character_set_filesystem`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_character_set_filesystem) system
variable controls the interpretation of the file name.

The [`SELECT ... INTO
OUTFILE`](select-into.md "15.2.13.1 SELECT ... INTO Statement") statement is intended to enable dumping a
table to a text file on the server host. To create the resulting
file on some other host,
[`SELECT ... INTO
OUTFILE`](select-into.md "15.2.13.1 SELECT ... INTO Statement") normally is unsuitable because there is no way
to write a path to the file relative to the server host file
system, unless the location of the file on the remote host can
be accessed using a network-mapped path on the server host file
system.

Alternatively, if the MySQL client software is installed on the
remote host, you can use a client command such as `mysql
-e "SELECT ..." >
file_name` to generate the
file on that host.

[`SELECT ... INTO
OUTFILE`](select-into.md "15.2.13.1 SELECT ... INTO Statement") is the complement of [`LOAD
DATA`](load-data.md "15.2.9 LOAD DATA Statement"). Column values are written converted to the
character set specified in the `CHARACTER SET`
clause. If no such clause is present, values are dumped using
the `binary` character set. In effect, there is
no character set conversion. If a result set contains columns in
several character sets, so is the output data file, and it may
not be possible to reload the file correctly.

The syntax for the *`export_options`*
part of the statement consists of the same
`FIELDS` and `LINES` clauses
that are used with the [`LOAD DATA`](load-data.md "15.2.9 LOAD DATA Statement")
statement. For more detailed information about the
`FIELDS` and `LINES` clauses,
including their default values and permissible values, see
[Section 15.2.9, “LOAD DATA Statement”](load-data.md "15.2.9 LOAD DATA Statement").

`FIELDS ESCAPED BY` controls how to write
special characters. If the `FIELDS ESCAPED BY`
character is not empty, it is used when necessary to avoid
ambiguity as a prefix that precedes following characters on
output:

- The `FIELDS ESCAPED BY` character
- The `FIELDS [OPTIONALLY] ENCLOSED BY`
  character
- The first character of the `FIELDS TERMINATED
  BY` and `LINES TERMINATED BY`
  values
- ASCII `NUL` (the zero-valued byte; what is
  actually written following the escape character is ASCII
  `0`, not a zero-valued byte)

The `FIELDS TERMINATED BY`, `ENCLOSED
BY`, `ESCAPED BY`, or `LINES
TERMINATED BY` characters *must* be
escaped so that you can read the file back in reliably. ASCII
`NUL` is escaped to make it easier to view with
some pagers.

The resulting file need not conform to SQL syntax, so nothing
else need be escaped.

If the `FIELDS ESCAPED BY` character is empty,
no characters are escaped and `NULL` is output
as `NULL`, not `\N`. It is
probably not a good idea to specify an empty escape character,
particularly if field values in your data contain any of the
characters in the list just given.

`INTO OUTFILE` can also be used with a
[`TABLE`](table.md "15.2.16 TABLE Statement") statement when you want to
dump all columns of a table into a text file. In this case, the
ordering and number of rows can be controlled using
`ORDER BY` and `LIMIT`; these
clauses must precede `INTO OUTFILE`.
`TABLE ... INTO OUTFILE` supports the same
*`export_options`* as does
`SELECT ... INTO OUTFILE`, and it is subject to
the same restrictions on writing to the file system. An example
of such a statement is shown here:

```sql
TABLE employees ORDER BY lname LIMIT 1000
    INTO OUTFILE '/tmp/employee_data_1.txt'
    FIELDS TERMINATED BY ',' OPTIONALLY ENCLOSED BY '"', ESCAPED BY '\'
    LINES TERMINATED BY '\n';
```

You can also use `SELECT ... INTO OUTFILE` with
a [`VALUES`](values.md "15.2.19 VALUES Statement") statement to write
values directly into a file. An example is shown here:

```sql
SELECT * FROM (VALUES ROW(1,2,3),ROW(4,5,6),ROW(7,8,9)) AS t
    INTO OUTFILE '/tmp/select-values.txt';
```

You must use a table alias; column aliases are also supported,
and can optionally be used to write values only from desired
columns. You can also use any or all of the export options
supported by `SELECT ... INTO OUTFILE` to
format the output to the file.

Here is an example that produces a file in the comma-separated
values (CSV) format used by many programs:

```sql
SELECT a,b,a+b INTO OUTFILE '/tmp/result.txt'
  FIELDS TERMINATED BY ',' OPTIONALLY ENCLOSED BY '"'
  LINES TERMINATED BY '\n'
  FROM test_table;
```

If you use `INTO DUMPFILE` instead of
`INTO OUTFILE`, MySQL writes only one row into
the file, without any column or line termination and without
performing any escape processing. This is useful for selecting a
[`BLOB`](blob.md "13.3.4 The BLOB and TEXT Types") value and storing it in a
file.

[`TABLE`](table.md "15.2.16 TABLE Statement") also supports `INTO
DUMPFILE`. If the table contains more than one row, you
must also use `LIMIT 1` to limit the output to
a single row. `INTO DUMPFILE` can also be used
with `SELECT * FROM (VALUES ROW()[, ...]) AS
table_alias [LIMIT 1]`. See
[Section 15.2.19, “VALUES Statement”](values.md "15.2.19 VALUES Statement").

Note

Any file created by `INTO OUTFILE` or
`INTO DUMPFILE` is owned by the operating
system user under whose account [**mysqld**](mysqld.md "6.3.1 mysqld — The MySQL Server")
runs. (You should *never* run
[**mysqld**](mysqld.md "6.3.1 mysqld — The MySQL Server") as `root` for this
and other reasons.) As of MySQL 8.0.17, the umask for file
creation is 0640; you must have sufficient access privileges
to manipulate the file contents. Prior to MySQL 8.0.17, the
umask is 0666 and the file is writable by all users on the
server host.

If the [`secure_file_priv`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_secure_file_priv)
system variable is set to a nonempty directory name, the file
to be written must be located in that directory.

In the context of
[`SELECT ...
INTO`](select-into.md "15.2.13.1 SELECT ... INTO Statement") statements that occur as part of events executed
by the Event Scheduler, diagnostics messages (not only errors,
but also warnings) are written to the error log, and, on
Windows, to the application event log. For additional
information, see [Section 27.4.5, “Event Scheduler Status”](events-status-info.md "27.4.5 Event Scheduler Status").

As of MySQL 8.0.22, support is provided for periodic
synchronization of output files written to by `SELECT
INTO OUTFILE` and `SELECT INTO
DUMPFILE`, enabled by setting the
[`select_into_disk_sync`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_select_into_disk_sync) server
system variable introduced in that version. Output buffer size
and optional delay can be set using, respectively,
[`select_into_buffer_size`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_select_into_buffer_size) and
[`select_into_disk_sync_delay`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_select_into_disk_sync_delay).
For more information, see the descriptions of these system
variables.
