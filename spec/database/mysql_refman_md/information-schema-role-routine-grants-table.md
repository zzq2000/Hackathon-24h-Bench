### 28.3.28 The INFORMATION\_SCHEMA ROLE\_ROUTINE\_GRANTS Table

The [`ROLE_ROUTINE_GRANTS`](information-schema-role-routine-grants-table.md "28.3.28 The INFORMATION_SCHEMA ROLE_ROUTINE_GRANTS Table") table
(available as of MySQL 8.0.19) provides information about the
routine privileges for roles that are available to or granted by
the currently enabled roles.

The [`ROLE_ROUTINE_GRANTS`](information-schema-role-routine-grants-table.md "28.3.28 The INFORMATION_SCHEMA ROLE_ROUTINE_GRANTS Table") table has
these columns:

- `GRANTOR`

  The user name part of the account that granted the role.
- `GRANTOR_HOST`

  The host name part of the account that granted the role.
- `GRANTEE`

  The user name part of the account to which the role is
  granted.
- `GRANTEE_HOST`

  The host name part of the account to which the role is
  granted.
- `SPECIFIC_CATALOG`

  The name of the catalog to which the routine belongs. This
  value is always `def`.
- `SPECIFIC_SCHEMA`

  The name of the schema (database) to which the routine
  belongs.
- `SPECIFIC_NAME`

  The name of the routine.
- `ROUTINE_CATALOG`

  The name of the catalog to which the routine belongs. This
  value is always `def`.
- `ROUTINE_SCHEMA`

  The name of the schema (database) to which the routine
  belongs.
- `ROUTINE_NAME`

  The name of the routine.
- `PRIVILEGE_TYPE`

  The privilege granted. The value can be any privilege that can
  be granted at the routine level; see [Section 15.7.1.6, “GRANT Statement”](grant.md "15.7.1.6 GRANT Statement").
  Each row lists a single privilege, so there is one row per
  column privilege held by the grantee.
- `IS_GRANTABLE`

  `YES` or `NO`, depending on
  whether the role is grantable to other accounts.
