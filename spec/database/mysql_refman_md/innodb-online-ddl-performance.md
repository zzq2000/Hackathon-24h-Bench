### 17.12.2 Online DDL Performance and Concurrency

Online DDL improves several aspects of MySQL operation:

- Applications that access the table are more responsive because
  queries and DML operations on the table can proceed while the
  DDL operation is in progress. Reduced locking and waiting for
  MySQL server resources leads to greater scalability, even for
  operations that are not involved in the DDL operation.
- Instant operations only modify metadata in the data
  dictionary. An exclusive metadata lock on the table may be
  taken briefly during the execution phase of the operation.
  Table data is unaffected, making operations instantaneous.
  Concurrent DML is permitted.
- Online operations avoid the disk I/O and CPU cycles associated
  with the table-copy method, which minimizes overall load on
  the database. Minimizing load helps maintain good performance
  and high throughput during the DDL operation.
- Online operations read less data into the buffer pool than
  table-copy operations, which reduces purging of frequently
  accessed data from memory. Purging of frequently accessed data
  can cause a temporary performance dip after a DDL operation.

#### The LOCK clause

By default, MySQL uses as little locking as possible during a
DDL operation. The `LOCK` clause can be
specified for in-place operations and some copy operations to
enforce more restrictive locking, if required. If the
`LOCK` clause specifies a less restrictive
level of locking than is permitted for a particular DDL
operation, the statement fails with an error.
`LOCK` clauses are described below, in order of
least to most restrictive:

- `LOCK=NONE`:

  Permits concurrent queries and DML.

  For example, use this clause for tables involving customer
  signups or purchases, to avoid making the tables unavailable
  during lengthy DDL operations.
- `LOCK=SHARED`:

  Permits concurrent queries but blocks DML.

  For example, use this clause on data warehouse tables, where
  you can delay data load operations until the DDL operation
  is finished, but queries cannot be delayed for long periods.
- `LOCK=DEFAULT`:

  Permits as much concurrency as possible (concurrent queries,
  DML, or both). Omitting the `LOCK` clause
  is the same as specifying `LOCK=DEFAULT`.

  Use this clause when you do not expect the default locking
  level of the DDL statement to cause any availability
  problems for the table.
- `LOCK=EXCLUSIVE`:

  Blocks concurrent queries and DML.

  Use this clause if the primary concern is finishing the DDL
  operation in the shortest amount of time possible, and
  concurrent query and DML access is not necessary. You might
  also use this clause if the server is supposed to be idle,
  to avoid unexpected table accesses.

#### Online DDL and Metadata Locks

Online DDL operations can be viewed as having three phases:

- *Phase 1: Initialization*

  In the initialization phase, the server determines how much
  concurrency is permitted during the operation, taking into
  account storage engine capabilities, operations specified in
  the statement, and user-specified
  `ALGORITHM` and `LOCK`
  options. During this phase, a shared upgradeable metadata
  lock is taken to protect the current table definition.
- *Phase 2: Execution*

  In this phase, the statement is prepared and executed.
  Whether the metadata lock is upgraded to exclusive depends
  on the factors assessed in the initialization phase. If an
  exclusive metadata lock is required, it is only taken
  briefly during statement preparation.
- *Phase 3: Commit Table Definition*

  In the commit table definition phase, the metadata lock is
  upgraded to exclusive to evict the old table definition and
  commit the new one. Once granted, the duration of the
  exclusive metadata lock is brief.

Due to the exclusive metadata lock requirements outlined above,
an online DDL operation may have to wait for concurrent
transactions that hold metadata locks on the table to commit or
rollback. Transactions started before or during the DDL
operation can hold metadata locks on the table being altered. In
the case of a long running or inactive transaction, an online
DDL operation can time out waiting for an exclusive metadata
lock. Additionally, a pending exclusive metadata lock requested
by an online DDL operation blocks subsequent transactions on the
table.

The following example demonstrates an online DDL operation
waiting for an exclusive metadata lock, and how a pending
metadata lock blocks subsequent transactions on the table.

Session 1:

```sql
mysql> CREATE TABLE t1 (c1 INT) ENGINE=InnoDB;
mysql> START TRANSACTION;
mysql> SELECT * FROM t1;
```

The session 1 [`SELECT`](select.md "15.2.13 SELECT Statement") statement
takes a shared metadata lock on table t1.

Session 2:

```sql
mysql> ALTER TABLE t1 ADD COLUMN x INT, ALGORITHM=INPLACE, LOCK=NONE;
```

The online DDL operation in session 2, which requires an
exclusive metadata lock on table t1 to commit table definition
changes, must wait for the session 1 transaction to commit or
roll back.

Session 3:

```sql
mysql> SELECT * FROM t1;
```

The [`SELECT`](select.md "15.2.13 SELECT Statement") statement issued in
session 3 is blocked waiting for the exclusive metadata lock
requested by the [`ALTER TABLE`](alter-table.md "15.1.9 ALTER TABLE Statement")
operation in session 2 to be granted.

You can use
[`SHOW FULL
PROCESSLIST`](show-processlist.md "15.7.7.29 SHOW PROCESSLIST Statement") to determine if transactions are waiting
for a metadata lock.

```sql
mysql> SHOW FULL PROCESSLIST\G
...
*************************** 2. row ***************************
     Id: 5
   User: root
   Host: localhost
     db: test
Command: Query
   Time: 44
  State: Waiting for table metadata lock
   Info: ALTER TABLE t1 ADD COLUMN x INT, ALGORITHM=INPLACE, LOCK=NONE
...
*************************** 4. row ***************************
     Id: 7
   User: root
   Host: localhost
     db: test
Command: Query
   Time: 5
  State: Waiting for table metadata lock
   Info: SELECT * FROM t1
4 rows in set (0.00 sec)
```

Metadata lock information is also exposed through the
Performance Schema [`metadata_locks`](performance-schema-metadata-locks-table.md "29.12.13.3 The metadata_locks Table")
table, which provides information about metadata lock
dependencies between sessions, the metadata lock a session is
waiting for, and the session that currently holds the metadata
lock. For more information, see
[Section 29.12.13.3, “The metadata\_locks Table”](performance-schema-metadata-locks-table.md "29.12.13.3 The metadata_locks Table").

#### Online DDL Performance

The performance of a DDL operation is largely determined by
whether the operation is performed instantly, in place, and
whether it rebuilds the table.

To assess the relative performance of a DDL operation, you can
compare results using `ALGORITHM=INSTANT`,
`ALGORITHM=INPLACE`, and
`ALGORITHM=COPY`. A statement can also be run
with [`old_alter_table`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_old_alter_table) enabled to
force the use of `ALGORITHM=COPY`.

For DDL operations that modify table data, you can determine
whether a DDL operation performs changes in place or performs a
table copy by looking at the “rows affected” value
displayed after the command finishes. For example:

- Changing the default value of a column (fast, does not
  affect the table data):

  ```sql
  Query OK, 0 rows affected (0.07 sec)
  ```
- Adding an index (takes time, but `0 rows
  affected` shows that the table is not copied):

  ```sql
  Query OK, 0 rows affected (21.42 sec)
  ```
- Changing the data type of a column (takes substantial time
  and requires rebuilding all the rows of the table):

  ```sql
  Query OK, 1671168 rows affected (1 min 35.54 sec)
  ```

Before running a DDL operation on a large table, check whether
the operation is fast or slow as follows:

1. Clone the table structure.
2. Populate the cloned table with a small amount of data.
3. Run the DDL operation on the cloned table.
4. Check whether the “rows affected” value is zero
   or not. A nonzero value means the operation copies table
   data, which might require special planning. For example, you
   might do the DDL operation during a period of scheduled
   downtime, or on each replica server one at a time.

Note

For a greater understanding of the MySQL processing associated
with a DDL operation, examine Performance Schema and
`INFORMATION_SCHEMA` tables related to
`InnoDB` before and after DDL operations to
see the number of physical reads, writes, memory allocations,
and so on.

Performance Schema stage events can be used to monitor
[`ALTER TABLE`](alter-table.md "15.1.9 ALTER TABLE Statement") progress. See
[Section 17.16.1, “Monitoring ALTER TABLE Progress for InnoDB Tables Using Performance
Schema”](monitor-alter-table-performance-schema.md "17.16.1 Monitoring ALTER TABLE Progress for InnoDB Tables Using Performance Schema").

Because there is some processing work involved with recording
the changes made by concurrent DML operations, then applying
those changes at the end, an online DDL operation could take
longer overall than the table-copy mechanism that blocks table
access from other sessions. The reduction in raw performance is
balanced against better responsiveness for applications that use
the table. When evaluating the techniques for changing table
structure, consider end-user perception of performance, based on
factors such as load times for web pages.
