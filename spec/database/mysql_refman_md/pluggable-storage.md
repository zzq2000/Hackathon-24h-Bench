### 18.11.1 Pluggable Storage Engine Architecture

MySQL Server uses a pluggable storage engine architecture that
enables storage engines to be loaded into and unloaded from a
running MySQL server.

**Plugging in a Storage Engine**

Before a storage engine can be used, the storage engine plugin
shared library must be loaded into MySQL using the
[`INSTALL PLUGIN`](install-plugin.md "15.7.4.4 INSTALL PLUGIN Statement") statement. For
example, if the `EXAMPLE` engine plugin is
named `example` and the shared library is named
`ha_example.so`, you load it with the
following statement:

```sql
INSTALL PLUGIN example SONAME 'ha_example.so';
```

To install a pluggable storage engine, the plugin file must be
located in the MySQL plugin directory, and the user issuing the
[`INSTALL PLUGIN`](install-plugin.md "15.7.4.4 INSTALL PLUGIN Statement") statement must
have [`INSERT`](privileges-provided.md#priv_insert) privilege for the
`mysql.plugin` table.

The shared library must be located in the MySQL server plugin
directory, the location of which is given by the
[`plugin_dir`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_plugin_dir) system variable.

**Unplugging a Storage Engine**

To unplug a storage engine, use the
[`UNINSTALL PLUGIN`](uninstall-plugin.md "15.7.4.6 UNINSTALL PLUGIN Statement") statement:

```sql
UNINSTALL PLUGIN example;
```

If you unplug a storage engine that is needed by existing
tables, those tables become inaccessible, but are still present
on disk (where applicable). Ensure that there are no tables
using a storage engine before you unplug the storage engine.
