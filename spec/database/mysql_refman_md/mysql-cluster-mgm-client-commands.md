### 25.6.1 Commands in the NDB Cluster Management Client

In addition to the central configuration file, a cluster may also
be controlled through a command-line interface available through
the management client [**ndb\_mgm**](mysql-cluster-programs-ndb-mgm.md "25.5.5 ndb_mgm — The NDB Cluster Management Client"). This is the
primary administrative interface to a running cluster.

Commands for the event logs are given in
[Section 25.6.3, “Event Reports Generated in NDB Cluster”](mysql-cluster-event-reports.md "25.6.3 Event Reports Generated in NDB Cluster"); commands for
creating backups and restoring from them are provided in
[Section 25.6.8, “Online Backup of NDB Cluster”](mysql-cluster-backup.md "25.6.8 Online Backup of NDB Cluster").

**Using ndb\_mgm with MySQL Cluster Manager.**

MySQL Cluster Manager 1.4.8 provides experimental support for NDB 8.0. MySQL Cluster Manager
handles starting and stopping processes and tracks their states
internally, so it is not necessary to use
[**ndb\_mgm**](mysql-cluster-programs-ndb-mgm.md "25.5.5 ndb_mgm — The NDB Cluster Management Client") for these tasks for an NDB Cluster
that is under MySQL Cluster Manager control. It is recommended
*not* to use the [**ndb\_mgm**](mysql-cluster-programs-ndb-mgm.md "25.5.5 ndb_mgm — The NDB Cluster Management Client")
command-line client that comes with the NDB Cluster distribution
to perform operations that involve starting or stopping nodes.
These include but are not limited to the
[`START`](mysql-cluster-mgm-client-commands.md#ndbclient-start),
[`STOP`](mysql-cluster-mgm-client-commands.md#ndbclient-stop),
[`RESTART`](mysql-cluster-mgm-client-commands.md#ndbclient-restart), and
[`SHUTDOWN`](mysql-cluster-mgm-client-commands.md#ndbclient-shutdown) commands. For more
information, see [MySQL Cluster Manager Process Commands](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/mysql-cluster-manager/8.0/en/mcm-process-commands.html).

The management client has the following basic commands. In the
listing that follows, *`node_id`* denotes
either a data node ID or the keyword `ALL`, which
indicates that the command should be applied to all of the
cluster's data nodes.

- [`CONNECT
  connection-string`](mysql-cluster-mgm-client-commands.md#ndbclient-connect)

  Connects to the management server indicated by the connection
  string. If the client is already connected to this server, the
  client reconnects.
- [`CREATE NODEGROUP
  nodeid[,
  nodeid, ...]`](mysql-cluster-mgm-client-commands.md#ndbclient-create-nodegroup)

  Creates a new NDB Cluster node group and causes data nodes to
  join it.

  This command is used after adding new data nodes online to an
  NDB Cluster, and causes them to join a new node group and thus
  to begin participating fully in the cluster. The command takes
  as its sole parameter a comma-separated list of node
  IDs—these are the IDs of the nodes just added and
  started, and that are to join the new node group. The list
  must contain no duplicate IDs; beginning with NDB 8.0.26, the
  presence of any duplicates causes the command to return an
  error. The number of nodes in the list must be the same as the
  number of nodes in each node group that is already part of the
  cluster (each NDB Cluster node group must have the same number
  of nodes). In other words, if the NDB Cluster consists of 2
  node groups having 2 data nodes each, then the new node group
  must also have 2 data nodes.

  The node group ID of the new node group created by this
  command is determined automatically, and always the next
  highest unused node group ID in the cluster; it is not
  possible to set it manually.

  For more information, see
  [Section 25.6.7, “Adding NDB Cluster Data Nodes Online”](mysql-cluster-online-add-node.md "25.6.7 Adding NDB Cluster Data Nodes Online").
- [`DROP NODEGROUP
  nodegroup_id`](mysql-cluster-mgm-client-commands.md#ndbclient-drop-nodegroup)

  Drops the NDB Cluster node group with the given
  *`nodegroup_id`*.

  This command can be used to drop a node group from an NDB
  Cluster. `DROP NODEGROUP` takes as its sole
  argument the node group ID of the node group to be dropped.

  `DROP NODEGROUP` acts only to remove the data
  nodes in the effected node group from that node group. It does
  not stop data nodes, assign them to a different node group, or
  remove them from the cluster's configuration. A data node
  that does not belong to a node group is indicated in the
  output of the management client
  [`SHOW`](mysql-cluster-mgm-client-commands.md#ndbclient-show) command with
  `no nodegroup` in place of the node group ID,
  like this (indicated using bold text):

  ```simple
  id=3    @10.100.2.67  (8.0.44-ndb-8.0.44, no nodegroup)
  ```

  `DROP NODEGROUP` works only when all data
  nodes in the node group to be dropped are completely empty of
  any table data and table definitions. Since there is currently
  no way using [**ndb\_mgm**](mysql-cluster-programs-ndb-mgm.md "25.5.5 ndb_mgm — The NDB Cluster Management Client") or the
  [**mysql**](mysql.md "6.5.1 mysql — The MySQL Command-Line Client") client to remove all data from a
  specific data node or node group, this means that the command
  succeeds only in the two following cases:

  1. After issuing [`CREATE
     NODEGROUP`](mysql-cluster-mgm-client-commands.md#ndbclient-create-nodegroup) in the [**ndb\_mgm**](mysql-cluster-programs-ndb-mgm.md "25.5.5 ndb_mgm — The NDB Cluster Management Client")
     client, but before issuing any
     [`ALTER TABLE
     ... REORGANIZE PARTITION`](alter-table.md "15.1.9 ALTER TABLE Statement") statements in the
     [**mysql**](mysql.md "6.5.1 mysql — The MySQL Command-Line Client") client.
  2. After dropping all [`NDBCLUSTER`](mysql-cluster.md "Chapter 25 MySQL NDB Cluster 8.0")
     tables using [`DROP TABLE`](drop-table.md "15.1.32 DROP TABLE Statement").

     [`TRUNCATE TABLE`](truncate-table.md "15.1.37 TRUNCATE TABLE Statement") does not
     work for this purpose because this removes only the table
     data; the data nodes continue to store an
     [`NDBCLUSTER`](mysql-cluster.md "Chapter 25 MySQL NDB Cluster 8.0") table's
     definition until a [`DROP
     TABLE`](drop-table.md "15.1.32 DROP TABLE Statement") statement is issued that causes the table
     metadata to be dropped.

  For more information about `DROP NODEGROUP`,
  see [Section 25.6.7, “Adding NDB Cluster Data Nodes Online”](mysql-cluster-online-add-node.md "25.6.7 Adding NDB Cluster Data Nodes Online").
- [`ENTER SINGLE USER MODE
  node_id`](mysql-cluster-mgm-client-commands.md#ndbclient-enter-single-user-mode)

  Enters single user mode, whereby only the MySQL server
  identified by the node ID *`node_id`*
  is permitted to access the database.

  The [**ndb\_mgm**](mysql-cluster-programs-ndb-mgm.md "25.5.5 ndb_mgm — The NDB Cluster Management Client") client provides a clear
  acknowledgement that this command has been issued and has
  taken effect, as shown here:

  ```ndbmgm
  ndb_mgm> ENTER SINGLE USER MODE 100
  Single user mode entered
  Access is granted for API node 100 only.
  ```

  In addition, the API or SQL node having exclusive access when
  in single user mode is indicated in the output of the
  [`SHOW`](mysql-cluster-mgm-client-commands.md#ndbclient-show) command, like this:

  ```ndbmgm
  ndb_mgm> SHOW
  Cluster Configuration
  ---------------------
  [ndbd(NDB)]     2 node(s)
  id=5    @127.0.0.1  (mysql-8.0.44 ndb-8.0.44, single user mode, Nodegroup: 0, *)
  id=6    @127.0.0.1  (mysql-8.0.44 ndb-8.0.44, single user mode, Nodegroup: 0)

  [ndb_mgmd(MGM)] 1 node(s)
  id=50   @127.0.0.1  (mysql-8.0.44 ndb-8.0.44)

  [mysqld(API)]   2 node(s)
  id=100  @127.0.0.1  (mysql-8.0.44 ndb-8.0.44, allowed single user)
  id=101 (not connected, accepting connect from any host)
  ```
- [`EXIT SINGLE USER MODE`](mysql-cluster-mgm-client-commands.md#ndbclient-exit-single-user-mode)

  Exits single user mode, enabling all SQL nodes (that is, all
  running [**mysqld**](mysqld.md "6.3.1 mysqld — The MySQL Server") processes) to access the
  database.

  Note

  It is possible to use `EXIT SINGLE USER
  MODE` even when not in single user mode, although
  the command has no effect in this case.
- [`HELP`](mysql-cluster-mgm-client-commands.md#ndbclient-help)

  Displays information on all available commands.
- [`node_id
  NODELOG DEBUG {ON|OFF}`](mysql-cluster-mgm-client-commands.md#ndbclient-nodelog-debug)

  Toggles debug logging in the node log, as though the effected
  data node or nodes had been started with the
  [`--verbose`](mysql-cluster-programs-ndbd.md#option_ndbd_verbose) option.
  `NODELOG DEBUG ON` starts debug logging;
  `NODELOG DEBUG OFF` switches debug logging
  off.
- [`PROMPT
  [prompt]`](mysql-cluster-mgm-client-commands.md#ndbclient-prompt)

  Changes the prompt shown by [**ndb\_mgm**](mysql-cluster-programs-ndb-mgm.md "25.5.5 ndb_mgm — The NDB Cluster Management Client") to the
  string literal *`prompt`*.

  *`prompt`* should not be quoted (unless
  you want the prompt to include the quotation marks). Unlike
  the case with the [**mysql**](mysql.md "6.5.1 mysql — The MySQL Command-Line Client") client, special
  character sequences and escapes are not recognized. If called
  without an argument, the command resets the prompt to the
  default value (`ndb_mgm>`).

  Some examples are shown here:

  ```ndbmgm
  ndb_mgm> PROMPT mgm#1:
  mgm#1: SHOW
  Cluster Configuration
  ...
  mgm#1: PROMPT mymgm >
  mymgm > PROMPT 'mymgm:'
  'mymgm:' PROMPT  mymgm:
  mymgm: PROMPT
  ndb_mgm> EXIT
  $>
  ```

  Note that leading spaces and spaces within the
  *`prompt`* string are not trimmed.
  Trailing spaces are removed.
- [`QUIT`](mysql-cluster-mgm-client-commands.md#ndbclient-quit),
  [`EXIT`](mysql-cluster-mgm-client-commands.md#ndbclient-quit)

  Terminates the management client.

  This command does not affect any nodes connected to the
  cluster.
- [`node_id
  REPORT report-type`](mysql-cluster-mgm-client-commands.md#ndbclient-report)

  Displays a report of type
  *`report-type`* for the data node
  identified by *`node_id`*, or for all
  data nodes using `ALL`.

  Currently, there are three accepted values for
  *`report-type`*:

  - `BackupStatus` provides a status report
    on a cluster backup in progress
  - `MemoryUsage` displays how much data
    memory and index memory is being used by each data node as
    shown in this example:

    ```ndbmgm
    ndb_mgm> ALL REPORT MEMORY

    Node 1: Data usage is 5%(177 32K pages of total 3200)
    Node 1: Index usage is 0%(108 8K pages of total 12832)
    Node 2: Data usage is 5%(177 32K pages of total 3200)
    Node 2: Index usage is 0%(108 8K pages of total 12832)
    ```

    This information is also available from the
    [`ndbinfo.memoryusage`](mysql-cluster-ndbinfo-memoryusage.md "25.6.16.45 The ndbinfo memoryusage Table")
    table.
  - `EventLog` reports events from the event
    log buffers of one or more data nodes.

  *`report-type`* is case-insensitive and
  “fuzzy”; for `MemoryUsage`, you
  can use `MEMORY` (as shown in the prior
  example), `memory`, or even simply
  `MEM` (or `mem`). You can
  abbreviate `BackupStatus` in a similar
  fashion.
- [`node_id
  RESTART [-n] [-i] [-a] [-f]`](mysql-cluster-mgm-client-commands.md#ndbclient-restart)

  Restarts the data node identified by
  *`node_id`* (or all data nodes).

  Using the `-i` option with
  `RESTART` causes the data node to perform an
  initial restart; that is, the node's file system is
  deleted and recreated. The effect is the same as that obtained
  from stopping the data node process and then starting it again
  using [**ndbd**](mysql-cluster-programs-ndbd.md "25.5.1 ndbd — The NDB Cluster Data Node Daemon")
  [`--initial`](mysql-cluster-programs-ndbd.md#option_ndbd_initial) from the system shell.

  Note

  Backup files and Disk Data files are not removed when this
  option is used.

  Using the `-n` option causes the data node
  process to be restarted, but the data node is not actually
  brought online until the appropriate
  [`START`](mysql-cluster-mgm-client-commands.md#ndbclient-start) command is issued.
  The effect of this option is the same as that obtained from
  stopping the data node and then starting it again using
  [**ndbd**](mysql-cluster-programs-ndbd.md "25.5.1 ndbd — The NDB Cluster Data Node Daemon") [`--nostart`](mysql-cluster-programs-ndbd.md#option_ndbd_nostart)
  or [**ndbd**](mysql-cluster-programs-ndbd.md "25.5.1 ndbd — The NDB Cluster Data Node Daemon") `-n` from the system
  shell.

  Using the `-a` causes all current transactions
  relying on this node to be aborted. No GCP check is done when
  the node rejoins the cluster.

  Normally, `RESTART` fails if taking the node
  offline would result in an incomplete cluster. The
  `-f` option forces the node to restart without
  checking for this. If this option is used and the result is an
  incomplete cluster, the entire cluster is restarted.
- [`SHOW`](mysql-cluster-mgm-client-commands.md#ndbclient-show)

  Displays basic information about the cluster and cluster
  nodes. For all nodes, the output includes the node's ID,
  type, and `NDB` software version. If the node
  is connected, its IP address is also shown; otherwise the
  output shows `not connected, accepting connect from
  ip_address`, with
  `any host` used for nodes that are permitted
  to connect from any address.

  In addition, for data nodes, the output includes
  `starting` if the node has not yet started,
  and shows the node group of which the node is a member. If the
  data node is acting as the master node, this is indicated with
  an asterisk (`*`).

  Consider a cluster whose configuration file includes the
  information shown here (possible additional settings are
  omitted for clarity):

  ```ini
  [ndbd default]
  DataMemory= 128G
  NoOfReplicas= 2

  [ndb_mgmd]
  NodeId=50
  HostName=198.51.100.150

  [ndbd]
  NodeId=5
  HostName=198.51.100.10
  DataDir=/var/lib/mysql-cluster

  [ndbd]
  NodeId=6
  HostName=198.51.100.20
  DataDir=/var/lib/mysql-cluster

  [ndbd]
  NodeId=7
  HostName=198.51.100.30
  DataDir=/var/lib/mysql-cluster

  [ndbd]
  NodeId=8
  HostName=198.51.100.40
  DataDir=/var/lib/mysql-cluster

  [mysqld]
  NodeId=100
  HostName=198.51.100.100

  [api]
  NodeId=101
  ```

  After this cluster (including one SQL node) has been started,
  `SHOW` displays the following output:

  ```ndbmgm
  ndb_mgm> SHOW
  Connected to Management Server at: localhost:1186
  Cluster Configuration
  ---------------------
  [ndbd(NDB)]     4 node(s)
  id=5    @198.51.100.10  (mysql-8.0.44 ndb-8.0.44, Nodegroup: 0, *)
  id=6    @198.51.100.20  (mysql-8.0.44 ndb-8.0.44, Nodegroup: 0)
  id=7    @198.51.100.30  (mysql-8.0.44 ndb-8.0.44, Nodegroup: 1)
  id=8    @198.51.100.40  (mysql-8.0.44 ndb-8.0.44, Nodegroup: 1)

  [ndb_mgmd(MGM)] 1 node(s)
  id=50   @198.51.100.150  (mysql-8.0.44 ndb-8.0.44)

  [mysqld(API)]   2 node(s)
  id=100  @198.51.100.100  (mysql-8.0.44 ndb-8.0.44)
  id=101 (not connected, accepting connect from any host)
  ```

  The output from this command also indicates when the cluster
  is in single user mode (see the description of the
  [`ENTER SINGLE USER MODE`](mysql-cluster-mgm-client-commands.md#ndbclient-enter-single-user-mode)
  command, as well as
  [Section 25.6.6, “NDB Cluster Single User Mode”](mysql-cluster-single-user-mode.md "25.6.6 NDB Cluster Single User Mode")). In NDB 8.0,
  it also indicates which API or SQL node has exclusive access
  when this mode is in effect; this works only when all data
  nodes and management nodes connected to the cluster are
  running NDB 8.0.
- [`SHUTDOWN`](mysql-cluster-mgm-client-commands.md#ndbclient-shutdown)

  Shuts down all cluster data nodes and management nodes. To
  exit the management client after this has been done, use
  [`EXIT`](mysql-cluster-mgm-client-commands.md#ndbclient-quit) or
  [`QUIT`](mysql-cluster-mgm-client-commands.md#ndbclient-quit).

  This command does *not* shut down any SQL
  nodes or API nodes that are connected to the cluster.
- [`node_id
  START`](mysql-cluster-mgm-client-commands.md#ndbclient-start)

  Brings online the data node identified by
  *`node_id`* (or all data nodes).

  `ALL START` works on all data nodes only, and
  does not affect management nodes.

  Important

  To use this command to bring a data node online, the data
  node must have been started using
  [`--nostart`](mysql-cluster-programs-ndbd.md#option_ndbd_nostart) or
  `-n`.
- [`node_id
  STATUS`](mysql-cluster-mgm-client-commands.md#ndbclient-status)

  Displays status information for the data node identified by
  *`node_id`* (or for all data nodes).

  Possible node status values include
  `UNKNOWN`, `NO_CONTACT`,
  `NOT_STARTED`, `STARTING`,
  `STARTED`, `SHUTTING_DOWN`,
  and `RESTARTING`.

  The output from this command also indicates when the cluster
  is in single user mode.
- [`node_id
  STOP [-a] [-f]`](mysql-cluster-mgm-client-commands.md#ndbclient-stop)

  Stops the data or management node identified by
  *`node_id`*.

  Note

  `ALL STOP` works to stop all data nodes
  only, and does not affect management nodes.

  A node affected by this command disconnects from the cluster,
  and its associated [**ndbd**](mysql-cluster-programs-ndbd.md "25.5.1 ndbd — The NDB Cluster Data Node Daemon") or
  [**ndb\_mgmd**](mysql-cluster-programs-ndb-mgmd.md "25.5.4 ndb_mgmd — The NDB Cluster Management Server Daemon") process terminates.

  The `-a` option causes the node to be stopped
  immediately, without waiting for the completion of any pending
  transactions.

  Normally, `STOP` fails if the result would
  cause an incomplete cluster. The `-f` option
  forces the node to shut down without checking for this. If
  this option is used and the result is an incomplete cluster,
  the cluster immediately shuts down.

  Warning

  Use of the `-a` option also disables the
  safety check otherwise performed when
  `STOP` is invoked to insure that stopping
  the node does not cause an incomplete cluster. In other
  words, you should exercise extreme care when using the
  `-a` option with the `STOP`
  command, due to the fact that this option makes it possible
  for the cluster to undergo a forced shutdown because it no
  longer has a complete copy of all data stored in
  [`NDB`](mysql-cluster.md "Chapter 25 MySQL NDB Cluster 8.0").

**Additional commands.**
A number of other commands available in the
[**ndb\_mgm**](mysql-cluster-programs-ndb-mgm.md "25.5.5 ndb_mgm — The NDB Cluster Management Client") client are described elsewhere, as
shown in the following list:

- [`START BACKUP`](mysql-cluster-backup-using-management-client.md "25.6.8.2 Using The NDB Cluster Management Client to Create a Backup") is used to
  perform an online backup in the [**ndb\_mgm**](mysql-cluster-programs-ndb-mgm.md "25.5.5 ndb_mgm — The NDB Cluster Management Client")
  client; the [`ABORT BACKUP`](mysql-cluster-backup-using-management-client.md#ndbclient-abort-backup "Cancelling backups")
  command is used to cancel a backup already in progress. For
  more information, see [Section 25.6.8, “Online Backup of NDB Cluster”](mysql-cluster-backup.md "25.6.8 Online Backup of NDB Cluster").
- The [`CLUSTERLOG`](mysql-cluster-logging-management-commands.md "25.6.3.1 NDB Cluster Logging Management Commands") command is
  used to perform various logging functions. See
  [Section 25.6.3, “Event Reports Generated in NDB Cluster”](mysql-cluster-event-reports.md "25.6.3 Event Reports Generated in NDB Cluster"), for more
  information and examples. `NODELOG DEBUG`
  activates or deactivates debug printouts in node logs, as
  described previously in this section.
- For testing and diagnostics work, the client supports a
  [`DUMP`](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/ndb-internals/en/dump-commands.html) command which can be
  used to execute internal commands on the cluster. It should
  never be used in a production setting unless directed to do so
  by MySQL Support. For more information, see
  [NDB Cluster Management Client DUMP Commands](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/ndb-internals/en/dump-commands.html).
