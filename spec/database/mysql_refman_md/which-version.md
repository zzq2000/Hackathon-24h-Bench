### 2.1.2 Which MySQL Version and Distribution to Install

When preparing to install MySQL, decide which version and
distribution format (binary or source) to use.

First, decide whether to install from a bugfix series like MySQL
8.4, or use an innovation release like MySQL
9.6. Both tracks include bug fixes while
an innovation release includes the newest features. Both bugfix
and innovation releases are meant for production use.

The naming scheme in MySQL 8.0 uses release names
that consist of three numbers and an optional suffix (for example,
**mysql-8.0.34**). The numbers within
the release name are interpreted as follows:

- The first number (**8**) is the
  major version number.
- The second number (**0**) is the
  minor version number. Taken together, the major and minor
  numbers constitute the release series number. The series
  number describes the stable feature set.
- The third number (**34**) is the
  version number within the release series. This is incremented
  for each new bugfix release; for an innovation release, it
  will likely always be 0. For a bugfix series such as MySQL
  8.0, the most recent version within the series is
  the best choice.

After choosing which MySQL version to install, decide which
distribution format to install for your operating system. For most
use cases, a binary distribution is the right choice. Binary
distributions are available in native format for many platforms,
such as RPM packages for Linux or DMG packages for macOS.
Distributions are also available in more generic formats such as
Zip archives or compressed **tar** files. On
Windows, you can use [the MySQL
Installer](mysql-installer.md "2.3.3 MySQL Installer for Windows") to install a binary distribution.

Under some circumstances, it may be preferable to install MySQL
from a source distribution:

- You want to install MySQL at some explicit location. The
  standard binary distributions are ready to run at any
  installation location, but you might require even more
  flexibility to place MySQL components where you want.
- You want to configure [**mysqld**](mysqld.md "6.3.1 mysqld — The MySQL Server") with features
  that might not be included in the standard binary
  distributions. Here is a list of the most common extra options
  used to ensure feature availability:

  - [`-DWITH_LIBWRAP=1`](source-configuration-options.md#option_cmake_with_libwrap) for TCP
    wrappers support.
  - [`-DWITH_ZLIB={system|bundled}`](source-configuration-options.md#option_cmake_with_zlib)
    for features that depend on compression
  - [`-DWITH_DEBUG=1`](source-configuration-options.md#option_cmake_with_debug) for debugging
    support

  For additional information, see
  [Section 2.8.7, “MySQL Source-Configuration Options”](source-configuration-options.md "2.8.7 MySQL Source-Configuration Options").
- You want to configure [**mysqld**](mysqld.md "6.3.1 mysqld — The MySQL Server") without some
  features that are included in the standard binary
  distributions.
- You want to read or modify the C and C++ code that makes up
  MySQL. For this purpose, obtain a source distribution.
- Source distributions contain more tests and examples than
  binary distributions.
