#### 30.4.3.40 The statements\_with\_temp\_tables and x$statements\_with\_temp\_tables Views

These views list normalized statements that have used
temporary tables. By default, rows are sorted by descending
number of on-disk temporary tables used and descending number
of in-memory temporary tables used.
