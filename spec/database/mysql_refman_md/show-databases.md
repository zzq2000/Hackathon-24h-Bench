#### 15.7.7.14 SHOW DATABASES Statement

```sql
SHOW {DATABASES | SCHEMAS}
    [LIKE 'pattern' | WHERE expr]
```

[`SHOW DATABASES`](show-databases.md "15.7.7.14 SHOW DATABASES Statement") lists the
databases on the MySQL server host.
[`SHOW
SCHEMAS`](show-databases.md "15.7.7.14 SHOW DATABASES Statement") is a synonym for [`SHOW
DATABASES`](show-databases.md "15.7.7.14 SHOW DATABASES Statement"). The [`LIKE`](string-comparison-functions.md#operator_like)
clause, if present, indicates which database names to match. The
`WHERE` clause can be given to select rows
using more general conditions, as discussed in
[Section 28.8, “Extensions to SHOW Statements”](extended-show.md "28.8 Extensions to SHOW Statements").

You see only those databases for which you have some kind of
privilege, unless you have the global [`SHOW
DATABASES`](show-databases.md "15.7.7.14 SHOW DATABASES Statement") privilege. You can also get this list using
the [**mysqlshow**](mysqlshow.md "6.5.7 mysqlshow — Display Database, Table, and Column Information") command.

If the server was started with the
[`--skip-show-database`](server-options.md#option_mysqld_skip-show-database) option, you
cannot use this statement at all unless you have the
[`SHOW DATABASES`](privileges-provided.md#priv_show-databases) privilege.

MySQL implements databases as directories in the data directory,
so this statement simply lists directories in that location.
However, the output may include names of directories that do not
correspond to actual databases.

Database information is also available from the
`INFORMATION_SCHEMA`
[`SCHEMATA`](information-schema-schemata-table.md "28.3.31 The INFORMATION_SCHEMA SCHEMATA Table") table. See
[Section 28.3.31, “The INFORMATION\_SCHEMA SCHEMATA Table”](information-schema-schemata-table.md "28.3.31 The INFORMATION_SCHEMA SCHEMATA Table").

Caution

Because any static global privilege is considered a privilege
for all databases, any static global privilege enables a user
to see all database names with [`SHOW
DATABASES`](show-databases.md "15.7.7.14 SHOW DATABASES Statement") or by examining the
[`SCHEMATA`](information-schema-schemata-table.md "28.3.31 The INFORMATION_SCHEMA SCHEMATA Table") table of
`INFORMATION_SCHEMA`, except databases that
have been restricted at the database level by partial revokes.
