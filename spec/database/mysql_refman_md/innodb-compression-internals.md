#### 17.9.1.5 How Compression Works for InnoDB Tables

This section describes some internal implementation details
about [compression](glossary.md#glos_compression "compression") for
InnoDB tables. The information presented here may be helpful in
tuning for performance, but is not necessary to know for basic
use of compression.

##### Compression Algorithms

Some operating systems implement compression at the file system
level. Files are typically divided into fixed-size blocks that
are compressed into variable-size blocks, which easily leads
into fragmentation. Every time something inside a block is
modified, the whole block is recompressed before it is written
to disk. These properties make this compression technique
unsuitable for use in an update-intensive database system.

MySQL implements compression with the help of the well-known
[zlib library](http://www.zlib.net/), which
implements the LZ77 compression algorithm. This compression
algorithm is mature, robust, and efficient in both CPU
utilization and in reduction of data size. The algorithm is
“lossless”, so that the original uncompressed data
can always be reconstructed from the compressed form. LZ77
compression works by finding sequences of data that are repeated
within the data to be compressed. The patterns of values in your
data determine how well it compresses, but typical user data
often compresses by 50% or more.

Unlike compression performed by an application, or compression
features of some other database management systems, InnoDB
compression applies both to user data and to indexes. In many
cases, indexes can constitute 40-50% or more of the total
database size, so this difference is significant. When
compression is working well for a data set, the size of the
InnoDB data files (the
[file-per-table](glossary.md#glos_file_per_table "file-per-table")
tablespace or [general
tablespace](glossary.md#glos_general_tablespace "general tablespace") `.ibd` files) is 25% to 50%
of the uncompressed size or possibly smaller. Depending on the
[workload](glossary.md#glos_workload "workload"), this smaller
database can in turn lead to a reduction in I/O, and an increase
in throughput, at a modest cost in terms of increased CPU
utilization. You can adjust the balance between compression
level and CPU overhead by modifying the
[`innodb_compression_level`](innodb-parameters.md#sysvar_innodb_compression_level)
configuration option.

##### InnoDB Data Storage and Compression

All user data in InnoDB tables is stored in pages comprising a
[B-tree](glossary.md#glos_b_tree "B-tree") index (the
[clustered index](glossary.md#glos_clustered_index "clustered index")). In
some other database systems, this type of index is called an
“index-organized table”. Each row in the index node
contains the values of the (user-specified or system-generated)
[primary key](glossary.md#glos_primary_key "primary key") and all the
other columns of the table.

[Secondary indexes](glossary.md#glos_secondary_index "secondary index") in
InnoDB tables are also B-trees, containing pairs of values: the
index key and a pointer to a row in the clustered index. The
pointer is in fact the value of the primary key of the table,
which is used to access the clustered index if columns other
than the index key and primary key are required. Secondary index
records must always fit on a single B-tree page.

The compression of B-tree nodes (of both clustered and secondary
indexes) is handled differently from compression of
[overflow pages](glossary.md#glos_overflow_page "overflow page") used to
store long `VARCHAR`, `BLOB`,
or `TEXT` columns, as explained in the
following sections.

##### Compression of B-Tree Pages

Because they are frequently updated, B-tree pages require
special treatment. It is important to minimize the number of
times B-tree nodes are split, as well as to minimize the need to
uncompress and recompress their content.

One technique MySQL uses is to maintain some system information
in the B-tree node in uncompressed form, thus facilitating
certain in-place updates. For example, this allows rows to be
delete-marked and deleted without any compression operation.

In addition, MySQL attempts to avoid unnecessary uncompression
and recompression of index pages when they are changed. Within
each B-tree page, the system keeps an uncompressed
“modification log” to record changes made to the
page. Updates and inserts of small records may be written to
this modification log without requiring the entire page to be
completely reconstructed.

When the space for the modification log runs out, InnoDB
uncompresses the page, applies the changes and recompresses the
page. If recompression fails (a situation known as a
[compression
failure](glossary.md#glos_compression_failure "compression failure")), the B-tree nodes are split and the process is
repeated until the update or insert succeeds.

To avoid frequent compression failures in write-intensive
workloads, such as for [OLTP](glossary.md#glos_oltp "OLTP")
applications, MySQL sometimes reserves some empty space
(padding) in the page, so that the modification log fills up
sooner and the page is recompressed while there is still enough
room to avoid splitting it. The amount of padding space left in
each page varies as the system keeps track of the frequency of
page splits. On a busy server doing frequent writes to
compressed tables, you can adjust the
[`innodb_compression_failure_threshold_pct`](innodb-parameters.md#sysvar_innodb_compression_failure_threshold_pct),
and
[`innodb_compression_pad_pct_max`](innodb-parameters.md#sysvar_innodb_compression_pad_pct_max)
configuration options to fine-tune this mechanism.

Generally, MySQL requires that each B-tree page in an InnoDB
table can accommodate at least two records. For compressed
tables, this requirement has been relaxed. Leaf pages of B-tree
nodes (whether of the primary key or secondary indexes) only
need to accommodate one record, but that record must fit, in
uncompressed form, in the per-page modification log. If
[`innodb_strict_mode`](innodb-parameters.md#sysvar_innodb_strict_mode) is
`ON`, MySQL checks the maximum row size during
[`CREATE TABLE`](create-table.md "15.1.20 CREATE TABLE Statement") or
[`CREATE INDEX`](create-index.md "15.1.15 CREATE INDEX Statement"). If the row does not
fit, the following error message is issued: `ERROR
HY000: Too big row`.

If you create a table when
[`innodb_strict_mode`](innodb-parameters.md#sysvar_innodb_strict_mode) is OFF, and
a subsequent `INSERT` or
`UPDATE` statement attempts to create an index
entry that does not fit in the size of the compressed page, the
operation fails with `ERROR 42000: Row size too
large`. (This error message does not name the index for
which the record is too large, or mention the length of the
index record or the maximum record size on that particular index
page.) To solve this problem, rebuild the table with
[`ALTER TABLE`](alter-table.md "15.1.9 ALTER TABLE Statement") and select a larger
compressed page size (`KEY_BLOCK_SIZE`),
shorten any column prefix indexes, or disable compression
entirely with `ROW_FORMAT=DYNAMIC` or
`ROW_FORMAT=COMPACT`.

[`innodb_strict_mode`](innodb-parameters.md#sysvar_innodb_strict_mode) is not
applicable to general tablespaces, which also support compressed
tables. Tablespace management rules for general tablespaces are
strictly enforced independently of
[`innodb_strict_mode`](innodb-parameters.md#sysvar_innodb_strict_mode). For more
information, see [Section 15.1.21, “CREATE TABLESPACE Statement”](create-tablespace.md "15.1.21 CREATE TABLESPACE Statement").

##### Compressing BLOB, VARCHAR, and TEXT Columns

In an InnoDB table, [`BLOB`](blob.md "13.3.4 The BLOB and TEXT Types"),
[`VARCHAR`](char.md "13.3.2 The CHAR and VARCHAR Types"), and
[`TEXT`](blob.md "13.3.4 The BLOB and TEXT Types") columns that are not part of
the primary key may be stored on separately allocated
[overflow pages](glossary.md#glos_overflow_page "overflow page"). We
refer to these columns as
[off-page columns](glossary.md#glos_off_page_column "off-page column").
Their values are stored on singly-linked lists of overflow
pages.

For tables created in `ROW_FORMAT=DYNAMIC` or
`ROW_FORMAT=COMPRESSED`, the values of
[`BLOB`](blob.md "13.3.4 The BLOB and TEXT Types"),
[`TEXT`](blob.md "13.3.4 The BLOB and TEXT Types"), or
[`VARCHAR`](char.md "13.3.2 The CHAR and VARCHAR Types") columns may be stored
fully off-page, depending on their length and the length of the
entire row. For columns that are stored off-page, the clustered
index record only contains 20-byte pointers to the overflow
pages, one per column. Whether any columns are stored off-page
depends on the page size and the total size of the row. When the
row is too long to fit entirely within the page of the clustered
index, MySQL chooses the longest columns for off-page storage
until the row fits on the clustered index page. As noted above,
if a row does not fit by itself on a compressed page, an error
occurs.

Note

For tables created in `ROW_FORMAT=DYNAMIC` or
`ROW_FORMAT=COMPRESSED`,
[`TEXT`](blob.md "13.3.4 The BLOB and TEXT Types") and
[`BLOB`](blob.md "13.3.4 The BLOB and TEXT Types") columns that are less than
or equal to 40 bytes are always stored in-line.

Tables that use `ROW_FORMAT=REDUNDANT` and
`ROW_FORMAT=COMPACT` store the first 768 bytes
of [`BLOB`](blob.md "13.3.4 The BLOB and TEXT Types"),
[`VARCHAR`](char.md "13.3.2 The CHAR and VARCHAR Types"), and
[`TEXT`](blob.md "13.3.4 The BLOB and TEXT Types") columns in the clustered
index record along with the primary key. The 768-byte prefix is
followed by a 20-byte pointer to the overflow pages that contain
the rest of the column value.

When a table is in `COMPRESSED` format, all
data written to overflow pages is compressed “as
is”; that is, MySQL applies the zlib compression
algorithm to the entire data item. Other than the data,
compressed overflow pages contain an uncompressed header and
trailer comprising a page checksum and a link to the next
overflow page, among other things. Therefore, very significant
storage savings can be obtained for longer
`BLOB`, `TEXT`, or
`VARCHAR` columns if the data is highly
compressible, as is often the case with text data. Image data,
such as `JPEG`, is typically already compressed
and so does not benefit much from being stored in a compressed
table; the double compression can waste CPU cycles for little or
no space savings.

The overflow pages are of the same size as other pages. A row
containing ten columns stored off-page occupies ten overflow
pages, even if the total length of the columns is only 8K bytes.
In an uncompressed table, ten uncompressed overflow pages occupy
160K bytes. In a compressed table with an 8K page size, they
occupy only 80K bytes. Thus, it is often more efficient to use
compressed table format for tables with long column values.

For [file-per-table](glossary.md#glos_file_per_table "file-per-table")
tablespaces, using a 16K compressed page size can reduce storage
and I/O costs for [`BLOB`](blob.md "13.3.4 The BLOB and TEXT Types"),
[`VARCHAR`](char.md "13.3.2 The CHAR and VARCHAR Types"), or
[`TEXT`](blob.md "13.3.4 The BLOB and TEXT Types") columns, because such data
often compress well, and might therefore require fewer overflow
pages, even though the B-tree nodes themselves take as many
pages as in the uncompressed form. General tablespaces do not
support a 16K compressed page size
(`KEY_BLOCK_SIZE`). For more information, see
[Section 17.6.3.3, “General Tablespaces”](general-tablespaces.md "17.6.3.3 General Tablespaces").

##### Compression and the InnoDB Buffer Pool

In a compressed `InnoDB` table, every
compressed page (whether 1K, 2K, 4K or 8K) corresponds to an
uncompressed page of 16K bytes (or a smaller size if
[`innodb_page_size`](innodb-parameters.md#sysvar_innodb_page_size) is set). To
access the data in a page, MySQL reads the compressed page from
disk if it is not already in the
[buffer pool](glossary.md#glos_buffer_pool "buffer pool"), then
uncompresses the page to its original form. This section
describes how `InnoDB` manages the buffer pool
with respect to pages of compressed tables.

To minimize I/O and to reduce the need to uncompress a page, at
times the buffer pool contains both the compressed and
uncompressed form of a database page. To make room for other
required database pages, MySQL can
[evict](glossary.md#glos_eviction "eviction") from the buffer pool
an uncompressed page, while leaving the compressed page in
memory. Or, if a page has not been accessed in a while, the
compressed form of the page might be written to disk, to free
space for other data. Thus, at any given time, the buffer pool
might contain both the compressed and uncompressed forms of the
page, or only the compressed form of the page, or neither.

MySQL keeps track of which pages to keep in memory and which to
evict using a least-recently-used
([LRU](glossary.md#glos_lru "LRU")) list, so that
[hot](glossary.md#glos_hot "hot") (frequently accessed) data
tends to stay in memory. When compressed tables are accessed,
MySQL uses an adaptive LRU algorithm to achieve an appropriate
balance of compressed and uncompressed pages in memory. This
adaptive algorithm is sensitive to whether the system is running
in an [I/O-bound](glossary.md#glos_io_bound "I/O-bound") or
[CPU-bound](glossary.md#glos_cpu_bound "CPU-bound") manner. The goal
is to avoid spending too much processing time uncompressing
pages when the CPU is busy, and to avoid doing excess I/O when
the CPU has spare cycles that can be used for uncompressing
compressed pages (that may already be in memory). When the
system is I/O-bound, the algorithm prefers to evict the
uncompressed copy of a page rather than both copies, to make
more room for other disk pages to become memory resident. When
the system is CPU-bound, MySQL prefers to evict both the
compressed and uncompressed page, so that more memory can be
used for “hot” pages and reducing the need to
uncompress data in memory only in compressed form.

##### Compression and the InnoDB Redo Log Files

Before a compressed page is written to a
[data file](glossary.md#glos_data_files "data files"), MySQL writes a
copy of the page to the redo log (if it has been recompressed
since the last time it was written to the database). This is
done to ensure that redo logs are usable for
[crash recovery](glossary.md#glos_crash_recovery "crash recovery"), even
in the unlikely case that the `zlib` library is
upgraded and that change introduces a compatibility problem with
the compressed data. Therefore, some increase in the size of
[log files](glossary.md#glos_log_file "log file"), or a need for
more frequent
[checkpoints](glossary.md#glos_checkpoint "checkpoint"), can be
expected when using compression. The amount of increase in the
log file size or checkpoint frequency depends on the number of
times compressed pages are modified in a way that requires
reorganization and recompression.

To create a compressed table in a file-per-table tablespace,
[`innodb_file_per_table`](innodb-parameters.md#sysvar_innodb_file_per_table) must be
enabled. There is no dependence on the
[`innodb_file_per_table`](innodb-parameters.md#sysvar_innodb_file_per_table) setting
when creating a compressed table in a general tablespace. For
more information, see [Section 17.6.3.3, “General Tablespaces”](general-tablespaces.md "17.6.3.3 General Tablespaces").
