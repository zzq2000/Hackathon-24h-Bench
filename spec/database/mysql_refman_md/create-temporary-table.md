#### 15.1.20.2 CREATE TEMPORARY TABLE Statement

You can use the `TEMPORARY` keyword when
creating a table. A `TEMPORARY` table is
visible only within the current session, and is dropped
automatically when the session is closed. This means that two
different sessions can use the same temporary table name without
conflicting with each other or with an existing
non-`TEMPORARY` table of the same name. (The
existing table is hidden until the temporary table is dropped.)

`InnoDB` does not support compressed temporary
tables. When [`innodb_strict_mode`](innodb-parameters.md#sysvar_innodb_strict_mode)
is enabled (the default),
[`CREATE TEMPORARY
TABLE`](create-table.md "15.1.20 CREATE TABLE Statement") returns an error if
`ROW_FORMAT=COMPRESSED` or
`KEY_BLOCK_SIZE` is specified. If
[`innodb_strict_mode`](innodb-parameters.md#sysvar_innodb_strict_mode) is disabled,
warnings are issued and the temporary table is created using a
non-compressed row format. The
[`innodb_file_per-table`](innodb-parameters.md#sysvar_innodb_file_per_table) option
does not affect the creation of `InnoDB`
temporary tables.

[`CREATE TABLE`](create-table.md "15.1.20 CREATE TABLE Statement") causes an implicit
commit, except when used with the `TEMPORARY`
keyword. See [Section 15.3.3, “Statements That Cause an Implicit Commit”](implicit-commit.md "15.3.3 Statements That Cause an Implicit Commit").

`TEMPORARY` tables have a very loose
relationship with databases (schemas). Dropping a database does
not automatically drop any `TEMPORARY` tables
created within that database.

To create a temporary table, you must have the
[`CREATE TEMPORARY TABLES`](privileges-provided.md#priv_create-temporary-tables)
privilege. After a session has created a temporary table, the
server performs no further privilege checks on the table. The
creating session can perform any operation on the table, such as
[`DROP TABLE`](drop-table.md "15.1.32 DROP TABLE Statement"),
[`INSERT`](insert.md "15.2.7 INSERT Statement"),
[`UPDATE`](update.md "15.2.17 UPDATE Statement"), or
[`SELECT`](select.md "15.2.13 SELECT Statement").

One implication of this behavior is that a session can
manipulate its temporary tables even if the current user has no
privilege to create them. Suppose that the current user does not
have the [`CREATE TEMPORARY TABLES`](privileges-provided.md#priv_create-temporary-tables)
privilege but is able to execute a definer-context stored
procedure that executes with the privileges of a user who does
have [`CREATE TEMPORARY TABLES`](privileges-provided.md#priv_create-temporary-tables) and
that creates a temporary table. While the procedure executes,
the session uses the privileges of the defining user. After the
procedure returns, the effective privileges revert to those of
the current user, which can still see the temporary table and
perform any operation on it.

You cannot use `CREATE TEMPORARY TABLE ...
LIKE` to create an empty table based on the definition
of a table that resides in the `mysql`
tablespace, `InnoDB` system tablespace
(`innodb_system`), or a general tablespace. The
tablespace definition for such a table includes a
`TABLESPACE` attribute that defines the
tablespace where the table resides, and the aforementioned
tablespaces do not support temporary tables. To create a
temporary table based on the definition of such a table, use
this syntax instead:

```sql
CREATE TEMPORARY TABLE new_tbl SELECT * FROM orig_tbl LIMIT 0;
```

Note

Support for `TABLESPACE =
innodb_file_per_table` and `TABLESPACE =
innodb_temporary` clauses with
[`CREATE TEMPORARY
TABLE`](create-table.md "15.1.20 CREATE TABLE Statement") is deprecated as of MySQL 8.0.13; expect it to
be removed in a future version of MySQL.
