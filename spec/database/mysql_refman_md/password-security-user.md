#### 8.1.2.1 End-User Guidelines for Password Security

MySQL users should use the following guidelines to keep
passwords secure.

When you run a client program to connect to the MySQL server, it
is inadvisable to specify your password in a way that exposes it
to discovery by other users. The methods you can use to specify
your password when you run client programs are listed here,
along with an assessment of the risks of each method. In short,
the safest methods are to have the client program prompt for the
password or to specify the password in a properly protected
option file.

- Use the [**mysql\_config\_editor**](mysql-config-editor.md "6.6.7 mysql_config_editor — MySQL Configuration Utility") utility,
  which enables you to store authentication credentials in an
  encrypted login path file named
  `.mylogin.cnf`. The file can be read
  later by MySQL client programs to obtain authentication
  credentials for connecting to MySQL Server. See
  [Section 6.6.7, “mysql\_config\_editor — MySQL Configuration Utility”](mysql-config-editor.md "6.6.7 mysql_config_editor — MySQL Configuration Utility").
- Use a
  `--password=password`
  or `-ppassword`
  option on the command line. For example:

  ```terminal
  $> mysql -u francis -pfrank db_name
  ```

  Warning

  This is convenient *but insecure*. On
  some systems, your password becomes visible to system
  status programs such as **ps** that may be
  invoked by other users to display command lines. MySQL
  clients typically overwrite the command-line password
  argument with zeros during their initialization sequence.
  However, there is still a brief interval during which the
  value is visible. Also, on some systems this overwriting
  strategy is ineffective and the password remains visible
  to **ps**. (SystemV Unix systems and
  perhaps others are subject to this problem.)

  If your operating environment is set up to display your
  current command in the title bar of your terminal window,
  the password remains visible as long as the command is
  running, even if the command has scrolled out of view in the
  window content area.
- Use the [`--password`](connection-options.md#option_general_password) or
  `-p` option on the command line with no
  password value specified. In this case, the client program
  solicits the password interactively:

  ```terminal
  $> mysql -u francis -p db_name
  Enter password: ********
  ```

  The `*` characters indicate where you enter
  your password. The password is not displayed as you enter
  it.

  It is more secure to enter your password this way than to
  specify it on the command line because it is not visible to
  other users. However, this method of entering a password is
  suitable only for programs that you run interactively. If
  you want to invoke a client from a script that runs
  noninteractively, there is no opportunity to enter the
  password from the keyboard. On some systems, you may even
  find that the first line of your script is read and
  interpreted (incorrectly) as your password.
- Store your password in an option file. For example, on Unix,
  you can list your password in the
  `[client]` section of the
  `.my.cnf` file in your home directory:

  ```ini
  [client]
  password=password
  ```

  To keep the password safe, the file should not be accessible
  to anyone but yourself. To ensure this, set the file access
  mode to `400` or `600`.
  For example:

  ```terminal
  $> chmod 600 .my.cnf
  ```

  To name from the command line a specific option file
  containing the password, use the
  [`--defaults-file=file_name`](option-file-options.md#option_general_defaults-file)
  option, where `file_name` is the full
  path name to the file. For example:

  ```terminal
  $> mysql --defaults-file=/home/francis/mysql-opts
  ```

  [Section 6.2.2.2, “Using Option Files”](option-files.md "6.2.2.2 Using Option Files"), discusses option files in
  more detail.

On Unix, the [**mysql**](mysql.md "6.5.1 mysql — The MySQL Command-Line Client") client writes a record of
executed statements to a history file (see
[Section 6.5.1.3, “mysql Client Logging”](mysql-logging.md "6.5.1.3 mysql Client Logging")). By default, this file is named
`.mysql_history` and is created in your home
directory. Passwords can be written as plain text in SQL
statements such as [`CREATE USER`](create-user.md "15.7.1.3 CREATE USER Statement")
and [`ALTER USER`](alter-user.md "15.7.1.1 ALTER USER Statement"), so if you use
these statements, they are logged in the history file. To keep
this file safe, use a restrictive access mode, the same way as
described earlier for the `.my.cnf` file.

If your command interpreter maintains a history, any file in
which the commands are saved contains MySQL passwords entered on
the command line. For example, **bash** uses
`~/.bash_history`. Any such file should have
a restrictive access mode.
