#### 15.7.7.32 SHOW RELAYLOG EVENTS Statement

```sql
SHOW RELAYLOG EVENTS
    [IN 'log_name']
    [FROM pos]
    [LIMIT [offset,] row_count]
    [channel_option]

channel_option:
    FOR CHANNEL channel
```

Shows the events in the relay log of a replica. If you do not
specify
`'log_name'`, the
first relay log is displayed. This statement has no effect on
the source. `SHOW RELAYLOG EVENTS` requires the
[`REPLICATION SLAVE`](privileges-provided.md#priv_replication-slave) privilege.

The `LIMIT` clause has the same syntax as for
the [`SELECT`](select.md "15.2.13 SELECT Statement") statement. See
[Section 15.2.13, “SELECT Statement”](select.md "15.2.13 SELECT Statement").

Note

Issuing a [`SHOW RELAYLOG EVENTS`](show-relaylog-events.md "15.7.7.32 SHOW RELAYLOG EVENTS Statement")
with no `LIMIT` clause could start a very
time- and resource-consuming process because the server
returns to the client the complete contents of the relay log
(including all statements modifying data that have been
received by the replica).

The optional `FOR CHANNEL
channel` clause enables you
to name which replication channel the statement applies to.
Providing a `FOR CHANNEL
channel` clause applies the
statement to a specific replication channel. If no channel is
named and no extra channels exist, the statement applies to the
default channel.

When using multiple replication channels, if a
[`SHOW RELAYLOG EVENTS`](show-relaylog-events.md "15.7.7.32 SHOW RELAYLOG EVENTS Statement") statement
does not have a channel defined using a `FOR CHANNEL
channel` clause an error is
generated. See [Section 19.2.2, “Replication Channels”](replication-channels.md "19.2.2 Replication Channels") for more
information.

[`SHOW RELAYLOG EVENTS`](show-relaylog-events.md "15.7.7.32 SHOW RELAYLOG EVENTS Statement") displays the
following fields for each event in the relay log:

- `Log_name`

  The name of the file that is being listed.
- `Pos`

  The position at which the event occurs.
- `Event_type`

  An identifier that describes the event type.
- `Server_id`

  The server ID of the server on which the event originated.
- `End_log_pos`

  The value of `End_log_pos` for this event
  in the source's binary log.
- `Info`

  More detailed information about the event type. The format
  of this information depends on the event type.

For compressed transaction payloads, the
`Transaction_payload_event` is first printed as
a single unit, then it is unpacked and each event inside it is
printed.

Some events relating to the setting of user and system variables
are not included in the output from [`SHOW
RELAYLOG EVENTS`](show-relaylog-events.md "15.7.7.32 SHOW RELAYLOG EVENTS Statement"). To get complete coverage of events
within a relay log, use [**mysqlbinlog**](mysqlbinlog.md "6.6.9 mysqlbinlog — Utility for Processing Binary Log Files").
