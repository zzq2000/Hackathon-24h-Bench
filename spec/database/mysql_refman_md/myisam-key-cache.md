To minimize disk I/O, the `MyISAM` storage
engine exploits a strategy that is used by many database
management systems. It employs a cache mechanism to keep the
most frequently accessed table blocks in memory:

- For index blocks, a special structure called the
  key cache (or
  key buffer) is
  maintained. The structure contains a number of block buffers
  where the most-used index blocks are placed.
- For data blocks, MySQL uses no special cache. Instead it
  relies on the native operating system file system cache.

This section first describes the basic operation of the
`MyISAM` key cache. Then it discusses features
that improve key cache performance and that enable you to better
control cache operation:

- Multiple sessions can access the cache concurrently.
- You can set up multiple key caches and assign table indexes
  to specific caches.

To control the size of the key cache, use the
[`key_buffer_size`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_key_buffer_size) system
variable. If this variable is set equal to zero, no key cache is
used. The key cache also is not used if the
[`key_buffer_size`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_key_buffer_size) value is too
small to allocate the minimal number of block buffers (8).

When the key cache is not operational, index files are accessed
using only the native file system buffering provided by the
operating system. (In other words, table index blocks are
accessed using the same strategy as that employed for table data
blocks.)

An index block is a contiguous unit of access to the
`MyISAM` index files. Usually the size of an
index block is equal to the size of nodes of the index B-tree.
(Indexes are represented on disk using a B-tree data structure.
Nodes at the bottom of the tree are leaf nodes. Nodes above the
leaf nodes are nonleaf nodes.)

All block buffers in a key cache structure are the same size.
This size can be equal to, greater than, or less than the size
of a table index block. Usually one these two values is a
multiple of the other.

When data from any table index block must be accessed, the
server first checks whether it is available in some block buffer
of the key cache. If it is, the server accesses data in the key
cache rather than on disk. That is, it reads from the cache or
writes into it rather than reading from or writing to disk.
Otherwise, the server chooses a cache block buffer containing a
different table index block (or blocks) and replaces the data
there by a copy of required table index block. As soon as the
new index block is in the cache, the index data can be accessed.

If it happens that a block selected for replacement has been
modified, the block is considered “dirty.” In this
case, prior to being replaced, its contents are flushed to the
table index from which it came.

Usually the server follows an LRU
(Least Recently Used) strategy: When choosing a block
for replacement, it selects the least recently used index block.
To make this choice easier, the key cache module maintains all
used blocks in a special list (LRU
chain) ordered by time of use. When a block is
accessed, it is the most recently used and is placed at the end
of the list. When blocks need to be replaced, blocks at the
beginning of the list are the least recently used and become the
first candidates for eviction.

The `InnoDB` storage engine also uses an LRU
algorithm, to manage its buffer pool. See
[Section 17.5.1, “Buffer Pool”](innodb-buffer-pool.md "17.5.1 Buffer Pool").
