#### 17.6.2.3 Sorted Index Builds

`InnoDB` performs a bulk load instead of
inserting one index record at a time when creating or rebuilding
indexes. This method of index creation is also known as a sorted
index build. Sorted index builds are not supported for spatial
indexes.

There are three phases to an index build. In the first phase, the
[clustered index](glossary.md#glos_clustered_index "clustered index") is
scanned, and index entries are generated and added to the sort
buffer. When the [sort
buffer](glossary.md#glos_sort_buffer "sort buffer") becomes full, entries are sorted and written out to
a temporary intermediate file. This process is also known as a
“run”. In the second phase, with one or more runs
written to the temporary intermediate file, a merge sort is
performed on all entries in the file. In the third and final
phase, the sorted entries are inserted into the
[B-tree](glossary.md#glos_b_tree "B-tree").

Prior to the introduction of sorted index builds, index entries
were inserted into the B-tree one record at a time using insert
APIs. This method involved opening a B-tree
[cursor](glossary.md#glos_cursor "cursor") to find the insert
position and then inserting entries into a B-tree page using an
[optimistic](glossary.md#glos_optimistic "optimistic") insert. If an
insert failed due to a page being full, a
[pessimistic](glossary.md#glos_pessimistic "pessimistic") insert would
be performed, which involves opening a B-tree cursor and splitting
and merging B-tree nodes as necessary to find space for the entry.
The drawbacks of this “top-down” method of building
an index are the cost of searching for an insert position and the
constant splitting and merging of B-tree nodes.

Sorted index builds use a “bottom-up” approach to
building an index. With this approach, a reference to the
right-most leaf page is held at all levels of the B-tree. The
right-most leaf page at the necessary B-tree depth is allocated
and entries are inserted according to their sorted order. Once a
leaf page is full, a node pointer is appended to the parent page
and a sibling leaf page is allocated for the next insert. This
process continues until all entries are inserted, which may result
in inserts up to the root level. When a sibling page is allocated,
the reference to the previously pinned leaf page is released, and
the newly allocated leaf page becomes the right-most leaf page and
new default insert location.

##### Reserving B-tree Page Space for Future Index Growth

To set aside space for future index growth, you can use the
[`innodb_fill_factor`](innodb-parameters.md#sysvar_innodb_fill_factor) variable to
reserve a percentage of B-tree page space. For example, setting
[`innodb_fill_factor`](innodb-parameters.md#sysvar_innodb_fill_factor) to 80 reserves
20 percent of the space in B-tree pages during a sorted index
build. This setting applies to both B-tree leaf and non-leaf
pages. It does not apply to external pages used for
[`TEXT`](blob.md "13.3.4 The BLOB and TEXT Types") or
[`BLOB`](blob.md "13.3.4 The BLOB and TEXT Types") entries. The amount of space
that is reserved may not be exactly as configured, as the
[`innodb_fill_factor`](innodb-parameters.md#sysvar_innodb_fill_factor) value is
interpreted as a hint rather than a hard limit.

##### Sorted Index Builds and Full-Text Index Support

Sorted index builds are supported for
[fulltext indexes](glossary.md#glos_fulltext_index "FULLTEXT index").
Previously, SQL was used to insert entries into a fulltext index.

##### Sorted Index Builds and Compressed Tables

For [compressed tables](glossary.md#glos_compression "compression"), the
previous index creation method appended entries to both compressed
and uncompressed pages. When the modification log (representing
free space on the compressed page) became full, the compressed
page would be recompressed. If compression failed due to a lack of
space, the page would be split. With sorted index builds, entries
are only appended to uncompressed pages. When an uncompressed page
becomes full, it is compressed. Adaptive padding is used to ensure
that compression succeeds in most cases, but if compression fails,
the page is split and compression is attempted again. This process
continues until compression is successful. For more information
about compression of B-Tree pages, see
[Section 17.9.1.5, “How Compression Works for InnoDB Tables”](innodb-compression-internals.md "17.9.1.5 How Compression Works for InnoDB Tables").

##### Sorted Index Builds and Redo Logging

[Redo logging](glossary.md#glos_redo_log "redo log") is disabled
during a sorted index build. Instead, there is a
[checkpoint](glossary.md#glos_checkpoint "checkpoint") to ensure that
the index build can withstand an unexpected exit or failure. The
checkpoint forces a write of all dirty pages to disk. During a
sorted index build, the [page
cleaner](glossary.md#glos_page_cleaner "page cleaner") thread is signaled periodically to flush
[dirty pages](glossary.md#glos_dirty_page "dirty page") to ensure that
the checkpoint operation can be processed quickly. Normally, the
page cleaner thread flushes dirty pages when the number of clean
pages falls below a set threshold. For sorted index builds, dirty
pages are flushed promptly to reduce checkpoint overhead and to
parallelize I/O and CPU activity.

##### Sorted Index Builds and Optimizer Statistics

Sorted index builds may result in
[optimizer](glossary.md#glos_optimizer "optimizer") statistics that
differ from those generated by the previous method of index
creation. The difference in statistics, which is not expected to
affect workload performance, is due to the different algorithm
used to populate the index.
