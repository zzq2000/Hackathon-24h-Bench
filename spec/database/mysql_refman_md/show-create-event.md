#### 15.7.7.7 SHOW CREATE EVENT Statement

```sql
SHOW CREATE EVENT event_name
```

This statement displays the [`CREATE
EVENT`](create-event.md "15.1.13 CREATE EVENT Statement") statement needed to re-create a given event. It
requires the [`EVENT`](privileges-provided.md#priv_event) privilege for
the database from which the event is to be shown. For example
(using the same event `e_daily` defined and
then altered in [Section 15.7.7.18, “SHOW EVENTS Statement”](show-events.md "15.7.7.18 SHOW EVENTS Statement")):

```sql
mysql> SHOW CREATE EVENT myschema.e_daily\G
*************************** 1. row ***************************
               Event: e_daily
            sql_mode: ONLY_FULL_GROUP_BY,STRICT_TRANS_TABLES,
                      NO_ZERO_IN_DATE,NO_ZERO_DATE,
                      ERROR_FOR_DIVISION_BY_ZERO,
                      NO_ENGINE_SUBSTITUTION
           time_zone: SYSTEM
        Create Event: CREATE DEFINER=`jon`@`ghidora` EVENT `e_daily`
                        ON SCHEDULE EVERY 1 DAY
                        STARTS CURRENT_TIMESTAMP + INTERVAL 6 HOUR
                        ON COMPLETION NOT PRESERVE
                        ENABLE
                        COMMENT 'Saves total number of sessions then
                                clears the table each day'
                        DO BEGIN
                          INSERT INTO site_activity.totals (time, total)
                            SELECT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP, COUNT(*)
                              FROM site_activity.sessions;
                          DELETE FROM site_activity.sessions;
                        END
character_set_client: utf8mb4
collation_connection: utf8mb4_0900_ai_ci
  Database Collation: utf8mb4_0900_ai_ci
```

`character_set_client` is the session value of
the [`character_set_client`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_character_set_client) system
variable when the event was created.
`collation_connection` is the session value of
the [`collation_connection`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_collation_connection) system
variable when the event was created. `Database
Collation` is the collation of the database with which
the event is associated.

The output reflects the current status of the event
(`ENABLE`) rather than the status with which it
was created.
