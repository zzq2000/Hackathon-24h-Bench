#### 7.6.7.9 Remote Cloning Operation Failure Handling

This section describes failure handing at different stages of a
cloning operation.

1. Prerequisites are checked (see
   [Remote Cloning Prerequisites](clone-plugin-remote.md#clone-remote-prerequisites "Remote Cloning Prerequisites")).

   - If a failure occurs during the prerequisite check, the
     [`CLONE
     INSTANCE`](clone.md "15.7.5 CLONE Statement") operation reports an error.
2. Prior to MySQL 8.0.27, a backup lock on the donor and
   recipient blocks concurrent DDL operations. From MySQL
   8.0.27, concurrent DDL on the donor is blocked only if the
   [`clone_block_ddl`](clone-plugin-options-variables.md#sysvar_clone_block_ddl) variable is
   set to `ON` (the default setting is
   `OFF`). See
   [Section 7.6.7.4, “Cloning and Concurrent DDL”](clone-plugin-concurrent-ddl.md "7.6.7.4 Cloning and Concurrent DDL").

   - If the cloning operation is unable to obtain a DDL lock
     within the time limit specified by the
     [`clone_ddl_timeout`](clone-plugin-options-variables.md#sysvar_clone_ddl_timeout)
     variable, an error is reported.
3. User-created data (schemas, tables, tablespaces) and binary
   logs on the recipient are removed before data is cloned to
   the recipient data directory.

   - When user-created data and binary logs are removed from
     the recipient data directory during a remote cloning
     operation, the data is not saved and may be lost if a
     failure occurs. If the data is of importance, a backup
     should be taken before initiating a remote cloning
     operation.

     For informational purposes, warnings are printed to the
     server error log to specify when data removal starts and
     finishes:

     ```terminal
     [Warning] [MY-013453] [InnoDB] Clone removing all user data for provisioning:
     Started...

     [Warning] [MY-013453] [InnoDB] Clone removing all user data for provisioning:
     Finished
     ```

     If a failure occurs while removing data, the recipient
     may be left with a partial set of schemas, tables, and
     tablespaces that existed before the cloning operation.
     Any time during the execution of a cloning operation or
     after a failure, the server is always in a consistent
     state.
4. Data is cloned from the donor. User-created data, dictionary
   metadata, and other system data are cloned.

   - If a failure occurs while cloning data, the cloning
     operation is rolled back and all cloned data removed. At
     this stage, the previously existing user-created data
     and binary logs on the recipient have also been removed.

     Should this scenario occur, you can either rectify the
     cause of the failure and re-execute the cloning
     operation, or forgo the cloning operation and restore
     the recipient data from a backup taken before the
     cloning operation.
5. The server is restarted automatically (applies to remote
   cloning operations that do not clone to a named directory).
   During startup, typical server startup tasks are performed.

   - If the automatic server restart fails, you can restart
     the server manually to complete the cloning operation.

Before MySQL 8.0.24, if a network error occurs during a cloning
operation, the operation resumes if the error is resolved within
five minutes. From MySQL 8.0.24, the operation resumes if the
error is resolved within the time specified by the
[`clone_donor_timeout_after_network_failure`](clone-plugin-options-variables.md#sysvar_clone_donor_timeout_after_network_failure)
variable defined on the donor instance. The
[`clone_donor_timeout_after_network_failure`](clone-plugin-options-variables.md#sysvar_clone_donor_timeout_after_network_failure)
default setting is 5 minutes but a range of 0 to 30 minutes is
supported. If the operation does not resume within the allotted
time, it aborts and returns an error, and the donor drops the
snapshot. A setting of zero causes the donor to drop the
snapshot immediately when a network error occurs. Configuring a
longer timeout allows more time for resolving network issues but
also increases the size of the delta on the donor instance,
which increases clone recovery time as well as replication lag
in cases where the clone is intended as a replica or replication
group member.

Prior to MySQL 8.0.24, donor threads use the MySQL Server
[`wait_timeout`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_wait_timeout) setting when
listening for Clone protocol commands. As a result, a low
[`wait_timeout`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_wait_timeout) setting could
cause a long running remote cloning operation to timeout. From
MySQL 8.0.24, the Clone idle timeout is set to the default
[`wait_timeout`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_wait_timeout) setting, which is
28800 seconds (8 hours).
