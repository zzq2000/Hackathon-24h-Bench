#### 15.6.6.5 Restrictions on Server-Side Cursors

Server-side cursors are implemented in the C API using the
[`mysql_stmt_attr_set()`](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/c-api/8.0/en/mysql-stmt-attr-set.html) function.
The same implementation is used for cursors in stored routines.
A server-side cursor enables a result set to be generated on the
server side, but not transferred to the client except for those
rows that the client requests. For example, if a client executes
a query but is only interested in the first row, the remaining
rows are not transferred.

In MySQL, a server-side cursor is materialized into an internal
temporary table. Initially, this is a `MEMORY`
table, but is converted to a `MyISAM` table
when its size exceeds the minimum value of the
[`max_heap_table_size`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_max_heap_table_size) and
[`tmp_table_size`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_tmp_table_size) system
variables. The same restrictions apply to internal temporary
tables created to hold the result set for a cursor as for other
uses of internal temporary tables. See
[Section 10.4.4, “Internal Temporary Table Use in MySQL”](internal-temporary-tables.md "10.4.4 Internal Temporary Table Use in MySQL"). One limitation of
the implementation is that for a large result set, retrieving
its rows through a cursor might be slow.

Cursors are read only; you cannot use a cursor to update rows.

`UPDATE WHERE CURRENT OF` and `DELETE
WHERE CURRENT OF` are not implemented, because
updatable cursors are not supported.

Cursors are nonholdable (not held open after a commit).

Cursors are asensitive.

Cursors are nonscrollable.

Cursors are not named. The statement handler acts as the cursor
ID.

You can have open only a single cursor per prepared statement.
If you need several cursors, you must prepare several
statements.

You cannot use a cursor for a statement that generates a result
set if the statement is not supported in prepared mode. This
includes statements such as [`CHECK
TABLE`](check-table.md "15.7.3.2 CHECK TABLE Statement"), `HANDLER READ`, and
[`SHOW BINLOG EVENTS`](show-binlog-events.md "15.7.7.2 SHOW BINLOG EVENTS Statement").
