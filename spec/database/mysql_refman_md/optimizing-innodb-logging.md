### 10.5.4 Optimizing InnoDB Redo Logging

Consider the following guidelines for optimizing redo logging:

- Increase the size of your redo log files. When
  `InnoDB` has written redo log files full,
  it must write the modified contents of the buffer pool to
  disk in a [checkpoint](glossary.md#glos_checkpoint "checkpoint").
  Small redo log files cause many unnecessary disk writes.

  From MySQL 8.0.30, the redo log file size is determined by
  the
  [`innodb_redo_log_capacity`](innodb-parameters.md#sysvar_innodb_redo_log_capacity)
  setting. `InnoDB` tries to maintain 32 redo
  log files of the same size, with each file equal to 1/32 \*
  `innodb_redo_log_capacity`. Therefore,
  changing the `innodb_redo_log_capacity`
  setting changes the size of the redo log files.

  Before MySQL 8.0.30, the size and number of redo log files
  are configured using the
  [`innodb_log_file_size`](innodb-parameters.md#sysvar_innodb_log_file_size) and
  [`innodb_log_files_in_group`](innodb-parameters.md#sysvar_innodb_log_files_in_group)
  variables.

  For information about modifying your redo log file
  configuration, see [Section 17.6.5, “Redo Log”](innodb-redo-log.md "17.6.5 Redo Log").
- Consider increasing the size of the
  [log buffer](glossary.md#glos_log_buffer "log buffer"). A large
  log buffer enables large
  [transactions](glossary.md#glos_transaction "transaction") to run
  without a need to write the log to disk before the
  transactions [commit](glossary.md#glos_commit "commit").
  Thus, if you have transactions that update, insert, or
  delete many rows, making the log buffer larger saves disk
  I/O. Log buffer size is configured using the
  [`innodb_log_buffer_size`](innodb-parameters.md#sysvar_innodb_log_buffer_size)
  configuration option, which can be configured dynamically in
  MySQL 8.0.
- Configure the
  [`innodb_log_write_ahead_size`](innodb-parameters.md#sysvar_innodb_log_write_ahead_size)
  configuration option to avoid “read-on-write”.
  This option defines the write-ahead block size for the redo
  log. Set
  [`innodb_log_write_ahead_size`](innodb-parameters.md#sysvar_innodb_log_write_ahead_size)
  to match the operating system or file system cache block
  size. Read-on-write occurs when redo log blocks are not
  entirely cached to the operating system or file system due
  to a mismatch between write-ahead block size for the redo
  log and operating system or file system cache block size.

  Valid values for
  [`innodb_log_write_ahead_size`](innodb-parameters.md#sysvar_innodb_log_write_ahead_size)
  are multiples of the `InnoDB` log file
  block size (2n). The minimum
  value is the `InnoDB` log file block size
  (512). Write-ahead does not occur when the minimum value is
  specified. The maximum value is equal to the
  [`innodb_page_size`](innodb-parameters.md#sysvar_innodb_page_size) value. If
  you specify a value for
  [`innodb_log_write_ahead_size`](innodb-parameters.md#sysvar_innodb_log_write_ahead_size)
  that is larger than the
  [`innodb_page_size`](innodb-parameters.md#sysvar_innodb_page_size) value, the
  [`innodb_log_write_ahead_size`](innodb-parameters.md#sysvar_innodb_log_write_ahead_size)
  setting is truncated to the
  [`innodb_page_size`](innodb-parameters.md#sysvar_innodb_page_size) value.

  Setting the
  [`innodb_log_write_ahead_size`](innodb-parameters.md#sysvar_innodb_log_write_ahead_size)
  value too low in relation to the operating system or file
  system cache block size results in read-on-write. Setting
  the value too high may have a slight impact on
  `fsync` performance for log file writes due
  to several blocks being written at once.
- MySQL 8.0.11 introduced dedicated log writer threads for
  writing redo log records from the log buffer to the system
  buffers and flushing the system buffers to the redo log
  files. Previously, individual user threads were responsible
  those tasks. As of MySQL 8.0.22, you can enable or disable
  log writer threads using the
  [`innodb_log_writer_threads`](innodb-parameters.md#sysvar_innodb_log_writer_threads)
  variable. Dedicated log writer threads can improve
  performance on high-concurrency systems, but for
  low-concurrency systems, disabling dedicated log writer
  threads provides better performance.
- Optimize the use of spin delay by user threads waiting for
  flushed redo. Spin delay helps reduce latency. During
  periods of low concurrency, reducing latency may be less of
  a priority, and avoiding the use of spin delay during these
  periods may reduce energy consumption. During periods of
  high concurrency, you may want to avoid expending processing
  power on spin delay so that it can be used for other work.
  The following system variables permit setting high and low
  watermark values that define boundaries for the use of spin
  delay.

  - [`innodb_log_wait_for_flush_spin_hwm`](innodb-parameters.md#sysvar_innodb_log_wait_for_flush_spin_hwm):
    Defines the maximum average log flush time beyond which
    user threads no longer spin while waiting for flushed
    redo. The default value is 400 microseconds.
  - [`innodb_log_spin_cpu_abs_lwm`](innodb-parameters.md#sysvar_innodb_log_spin_cpu_abs_lwm):
    Defines the minimum amount of CPU usage below which user
    threads no longer spin while waiting for flushed redo.
    The value is expressed as a sum of CPU core usage. For
    example, The default value of 80 is 80% of a single CPU
    core. On a system with a multi-core processor, a value
    of 150 represents 100% usage of one CPU core plus 50%
    usage of a second CPU core.
  - [`innodb_log_spin_cpu_pct_hwm`](innodb-parameters.md#sysvar_innodb_log_spin_cpu_pct_hwm):
    Defines the maximum amount of CPU usage above which user
    threads no longer spin while waiting for flushed redo.
    The value is expressed as a percentage of the combined
    total processing power of all CPU cores. The default
    value is 50%. For example, 100% usage of two CPU cores
    is 50% of the combined CPU processing power on a server
    with four CPU cores.

    The
    [`innodb_log_spin_cpu_pct_hwm`](innodb-parameters.md#sysvar_innodb_log_spin_cpu_pct_hwm)
    configuration option respects processor affinity. For
    example, if a server has 48 cores but the
    [**mysqld**](mysqld.md "6.3.1 mysqld — The MySQL Server") process is pinned to only four
    CPU cores, the other 44 CPU cores are ignored.
