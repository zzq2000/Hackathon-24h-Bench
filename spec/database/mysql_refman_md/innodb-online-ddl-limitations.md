### 17.12.8 Online DDL Limitations

The following limitations apply to online DDL operations:

- The table is copied when creating an index on a
  `TEMPORARY TABLE`.
- The [`ALTER TABLE`](alter-table.md "15.1.9 ALTER TABLE Statement") clause
  `LOCK=NONE` is not permitted if there are
  `ON...CASCADE` or `ON...SET
  NULL` constraints on the table.
- Before an in-place online DDL operation can finish, it must
  wait for transactions that hold metadata locks on the table to
  commit or roll back. An online DDL operation may briefly
  require an exclusive metadata lock on the table during its
  execution phase, and always requires one in the final phase of
  the operation when updating the table definition.
  Consequently, transactions holding metadata locks on the table
  can cause an online DDL operation to block. The transactions
  that hold metadata locks on the table may have been started
  before or during the online DDL operation. A long running or
  inactive transaction that holds a metadata lock on the table
  can cause an online DDL operation to timeout.
- When running an in-place online DDL operation, the thread that
  runs the [`ALTER TABLE`](alter-table.md "15.1.9 ALTER TABLE Statement") statement
  applies an online log of DML operations that were run
  concurrently on the same table from other connection threads.
  When the DML operations are applied, it is possible to
  encounter a duplicate key entry error (ERROR 1062
  (23000): Duplicate entry), even if the duplicate
  entry is only temporary and would be reverted by a later entry
  in the online log. This is similar to the idea of a foreign
  key constraint check in `InnoDB` in which
  constraints must hold during a transaction.
- [`OPTIMIZE TABLE`](optimize-table.md "15.7.3.4 OPTIMIZE TABLE Statement") for an
  `InnoDB` table is mapped to an
  [`ALTER TABLE`](alter-table.md "15.1.9 ALTER TABLE Statement") operation to
  rebuild the table and update index statistics and free unused
  space in the clustered index. Secondary indexes are not
  created as efficiently because keys are inserted in the order
  they appeared in the primary key.
  [`OPTIMIZE TABLE`](optimize-table.md "15.7.3.4 OPTIMIZE TABLE Statement") is supported
  with the addition of online DDL support for rebuilding regular
  and partitioned `InnoDB` tables.
- Tables created before MySQL 5.6 that include temporal columns
  ([`DATE`](datetime.md "13.2.2 The DATE, DATETIME, and TIMESTAMP Types"),
  [`DATETIME`](datetime.md "13.2.2 The DATE, DATETIME, and TIMESTAMP Types") or
  [`TIMESTAMP`](datetime.md "13.2.2 The DATE, DATETIME, and TIMESTAMP Types")) and have not been
  rebuilt using  `ALGORITHM=COPY` do not
  support `ALGORITHM=INPLACE`. In this case, an
  [`ALTER TABLE ...
  ALGORITHM=INPLACE`](alter-table.md "15.1.9 ALTER TABLE Statement") operation returns the following
  error:

  ```sql
  ERROR 1846 (0A000): ALGORITHM=INPLACE is not supported.
  Reason: Cannot change column type INPLACE. Try ALGORITHM=COPY.
  ```
- The following limitations are generally applicable to online
  DDL operations on large tables that involve rebuilding the
  table:

  - There is no mechanism to pause an online DDL operation or
    to throttle I/O or CPU usage for an online DDL operation.
  - Rollback of an online DDL operation can be expensive
    should the operation fail.
  - Long running online DDL operations can cause replication
    lag. An online DDL operation must finish running on the
    source before it is run on the replica. Also, DML that was
    processed concurrently on the source is only processed on
    the replica after the DDL operation on the replica is
    completed.

  operations on large tables, see
