## 18.9 The EXAMPLE Storage Engine

The `EXAMPLE` storage engine is a stub engine that
does nothing. Its purpose is to serve as an example in the MySQL
source code that illustrates how to begin writing new storage
engines. As such, it is primarily of interest to developers.

To enable the `EXAMPLE` storage engine if you build
MySQL from source, invoke **CMake** with the
[`-DWITH_EXAMPLE_STORAGE_ENGINE`](source-configuration-options.md#option_cmake_storage_engine_options "Storage Engine Options")
option.

To examine the source for the `EXAMPLE` engine,
look in the `storage/example` directory of a
MySQL source distribution.

When you create an `EXAMPLE` table, no files are
created. No data can be stored into the table. Retrievals return an
empty result.

```sql
mysql> CREATE TABLE test (i INT) ENGINE = EXAMPLE;
Query OK, 0 rows affected (0.78 sec)

mysql> INSERT INTO test VALUES(1),(2),(3);
ERROR 1031 (HY000): Table storage engine for 'test' doesn't »
                    have this option

mysql> SELECT * FROM test;
Empty set (0.31 sec)
```

The `EXAMPLE` storage engine does not support
indexing.

The `EXAMPLE` storage engine does not support
partitioning.
