#### 29.12.13.3 The metadata\_locks Table

MySQL uses metadata locking to manage concurrent access to
database objects and to ensure data consistency; see
[Section 10.11.4, “Metadata Locking”](metadata-locking.md "10.11.4 Metadata Locking"). Metadata locking applies
not just to tables, but also to schemas, stored programs
(procedures, functions, triggers, scheduled events),
tablespaces, user locks acquired with the
[`GET_LOCK()`](locking-functions.md#function_get-lock) function (see
[Section 14.14, “Locking Functions”](locking-functions.md "14.14 Locking Functions")), and locks acquired with
the locking service described in
[Section 7.6.9.1, “The Locking Service”](locking-service.md "7.6.9.1 The Locking Service").

The Performance Schema exposes metadata lock information
through the [`metadata_locks`](performance-schema-metadata-locks-table.md "29.12.13.3 The metadata_locks Table") table:

- Locks that have been granted (shows which sessions own
  which current metadata locks).
- Locks that have been requested but not yet granted (shows
  which sessions are waiting for which metadata locks).
- Lock requests that have been killed by the deadlock
  detector.
- Lock requests that have timed out and are waiting for the
  requesting session's lock request to be discarded.

This information enables you to understand metadata lock
dependencies between sessions. You can see not only which lock
a session is waiting for, but which session currently holds
that lock.

The [`metadata_locks`](performance-schema-metadata-locks-table.md "29.12.13.3 The metadata_locks Table") table is read
only and cannot be updated. It is autosized by default; to
configure the table size, set the
[`performance_schema_max_metadata_locks`](performance-schema-system-variables.md#sysvar_performance_schema_max_metadata_locks)
system variable at server startup.

Metadata lock instrumentation uses the
`wait/lock/metadata/sql/mdl` instrument,
which is enabled by default.

To control metadata lock instrumentation state at server
startup, use lines like these in your
`my.cnf` file:

- Enable:

  ```ini
  [mysqld]
  performance-schema-instrument='wait/lock/metadata/sql/mdl=ON'
  ```
- Disable:

  ```ini
  [mysqld]
  performance-schema-instrument='wait/lock/metadata/sql/mdl=OFF'
  ```

To control metadata lock instrumentation state at runtime,
update the [`setup_instruments`](performance-schema-setup-instruments-table.md "29.12.2.3 The setup_instruments Table")
table:

- Enable:

  ```sql
  UPDATE performance_schema.setup_instruments
  SET ENABLED = 'YES', TIMED = 'YES'
  WHERE NAME = 'wait/lock/metadata/sql/mdl';
  ```
- Disable:

  ```sql
  UPDATE performance_schema.setup_instruments
  SET ENABLED = 'NO', TIMED = 'NO'
  WHERE NAME = 'wait/lock/metadata/sql/mdl';
  ```

The Performance Schema maintains
[`metadata_locks`](performance-schema-metadata-locks-table.md "29.12.13.3 The metadata_locks Table") table content as
follows, using the `LOCK_STATUS` column to
indicate the status of each lock:

- When a metadata lock is requested and obtained
  immediately, a row with a status of
  `GRANTED` is inserted.
- When a metadata lock is requested and not obtained
  immediately, a row with a status of
  `PENDING` is inserted.
- When a metadata lock previously requested is granted, its
  row status is updated to `GRANTED`.
- When a metadata lock is released, its row is deleted.
- When a pending lock request is canceled by the deadlock
  detector to break a deadlock
  ([`ER_LOCK_DEADLOCK`](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/mysql-errors/8.0/en/server-error-reference.html#error_er_lock_deadlock)), its
  row status is updated from `PENDING` to
  `VICTIM`.
- When a pending lock request times out
  ([`ER_LOCK_WAIT_TIMEOUT`](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/mysql-errors/8.0/en/server-error-reference.html#error_er_lock_wait_timeout)),
  its row status is updated from `PENDING`
  to `TIMEOUT`.
- When granted lock or pending lock request is killed, its
  row status is updated from `GRANTED` or
  `PENDING` to `KILLED`.
- The `VICTIM`, `TIMEOUT`,
  and `KILLED` status values are brief and
  signify that the lock row is about to be deleted.
- The `PRE_ACQUIRE_NOTIFY` and
  `POST_RELEASE_NOTIFY` status values are
  brief and signify that the metadata locking subsubsystem
  is notifying interested storage engines while entering
  lock acquisition operations or leaving lock release
  operations.

The [`metadata_locks`](performance-schema-metadata-locks-table.md "29.12.13.3 The metadata_locks Table") table has
these columns:

- `OBJECT_TYPE`

  The type of lock used in the metadata lock subsystem. The
  value is one of `GLOBAL`,
  `SCHEMA`, `TABLE`,
  `FUNCTION`, `PROCEDURE`,
  `TRIGGER` (currently unused),
  `EVENT`, `COMMIT`,
  `USER LEVEL LOCK`,
  `TABLESPACE`, `BACKUP
  LOCK`, or `LOCKING SERVICE`.

  A value of `USER LEVEL LOCK` indicates a
  lock acquired with
  [`GET_LOCK()`](locking-functions.md#function_get-lock). A value of
  `LOCKING SERVICE` indicates a lock
  acquired with the locking service described in
  [Section 7.6.9.1, “The Locking Service”](locking-service.md "7.6.9.1 The Locking Service").
- `OBJECT_SCHEMA`

  The schema that contains the object.
- `OBJECT_NAME`

  The name of the instrumented object.
- `OBJECT_INSTANCE_BEGIN`

  The address in memory of the instrumented object.
- `LOCK_TYPE`

  The lock type from the metadata lock subsystem. The value
  is one of `INTENTION_EXCLUSIVE`,
  `SHARED`,
  `SHARED_HIGH_PRIO`,
  `SHARED_READ`,
  `SHARED_WRITE`,
  `SHARED_UPGRADABLE`,
  `SHARED_NO_WRITE`,
  `SHARED_NO_READ_WRITE`, or
  `EXCLUSIVE`.
- `LOCK_DURATION`

  The lock duration from the metadata lock subsystem. The
  value is one of `STATEMENT`,
  `TRANSACTION`, or
  `EXPLICIT`. The
  `STATEMENT` and
  `TRANSACTION` values signify locks that
  are released implicitly at statement or transaction end,
  respectively. The `EXPLICIT` value
  signifies locks that survive statement or transaction end
  and are released by explicit action, such as global locks
  acquired with [`FLUSH TABLES WITH READ
  LOCK`](flush.md#flush-tables-with-read-lock).
- `LOCK_STATUS`

  The lock status from the metadata lock subsystem. The
  value is one of `PENDING`,
  `GRANTED`, `VICTIM`,
  `TIMEOUT`, `KILLED`,
  `PRE_ACQUIRE_NOTIFY`, or
  `POST_RELEASE_NOTIFY`. The Performance
  Schema assigns these values as described previously.
- `SOURCE`

  The name of the source file containing the instrumented
  code that produced the event and the line number in the
  file at which the instrumentation occurs. This enables you
  to check the source to determine exactly what code is
  involved.
- `OWNER_THREAD_ID`

  The thread requesting a metadata lock.
- `OWNER_EVENT_ID`

  The event requesting a metadata lock.

The [`metadata_locks`](performance-schema-metadata-locks-table.md "29.12.13.3 The metadata_locks Table") table has
these indexes:

- Primary key on (`OBJECT_INSTANCE_BEGIN`)
- Index on (`OBJECT_TYPE`,
  `OBJECT_SCHEMA`,
  `OBJECT_NAME`)
- Index on (`OWNER_THREAD_ID`,
  `OWNER_EVENT_ID`)

[`TRUNCATE TABLE`](truncate-table.md "15.1.37 TRUNCATE TABLE Statement") is not permitted
for the [`metadata_locks`](performance-schema-metadata-locks-table.md "29.12.13.3 The metadata_locks Table") table.
