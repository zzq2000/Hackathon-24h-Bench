### 12.13.3 Multi-Byte Character Support for Complex Character Sets

If you want to add support for a new character set named
*`MYSET`* that includes multibyte
characters, you must use multibyte character functions in the
`ctype-MYSET.c`
source file in the `strings` directory.

The existing character sets provide the best documentation and
examples to show how these functions are implemented. Look at
the `ctype-*.c` files in the
`strings` directory, such as the files for
the `euc_kr`, `gb2312`,
`gbk`, `sjis`, and
`ujis` character sets. Take a look at the
`MY_CHARSET_HANDLER` structures to see how they
are used. See also the `CHARSET_INFO.txt`
file in the `strings` directory for
additional information.
