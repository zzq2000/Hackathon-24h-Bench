### 22.5.5 Connection Compression with X Plugin

From MySQL 8.0.19, X Plugin supports compression of messages sent
over X Protocol connections. Connections can be compressed if the
server and the client agree on a mutually supported compression
algorithm. Enabling compression reduces the number of bytes sent
over the network, but adds to the server and client an additional
CPU cost for compression and decompression operations. The
benefits of compression therefore occur primarily when there is
low network bandwidth, network transfer time dominates the cost of
compression and decompression operations, and result sets are
large.

Note

Different MySQL clients implement support for connection
compression differently; consult your client documentation for
details. For example, for classic MySQL protocol connections, see
[Section 6.2.8, “Connection Compression Control”](connection-compression-control.md "6.2.8 Connection Compression Control").

- [Compressed Connection Characteristics for X Plugin](x-plugin-connection-compression.md#x-plugin-connection-compression-characteristics "Compressed Connection Characteristics for X Plugin")

#### Configuring Connection Compression for X Plugin

By default, X Plugin supports the zstd, LZ4, and Deflate
compression algorithms. Compression with the Deflate algorithm
is carried out using the zlib software library, so the
`deflate_stream` compression algorithm setting
for X Protocol connections is equivalent to the
`zlib` setting for classic MySQL protocol
connections.

On the server side, you can disallow any of the compression
algorithms by setting the
[`mysqlx_compression_algorithms`](x-plugin-options-system-variables.md#sysvar_mysqlx_compression_algorithms)
system variable to include only those permitted. The algorithm
names `zstd_stream`,
`lz4_message`, and
`deflate_stream` can be specified in any
combination, and the order and lettercase are not important. If
the system variable value is the empty string, no compression
algorithms are permitted and connections are uncompressed.

The following table compares the characteristics of the
different compression algorithms and shows their assigned
priorities. By default, the server chooses the highest-priority
algorithm permitted in common by the server and the client;
clients may change the priorities as described later. The short
form alias for the algorithms can be used by clients when
specifying them.

**Table 22.1 X Protocol Compression Algorithm Characteristics**

| Algorithm | Alias | Compression Ratio | Throughput | CPU Cost | Default Priority |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `zsth_stream` | `zstd` | High | High | Medium | First |
| `lz4_message` | `lz4` | Low | High | Lowest | Second |
| `deflate_stream` | `deflate` | High | Low | Highest | Third |

The X Protocol set of permitted compression algorithms (whether
user-specified or default) is independent of the set of
compression algorithms permitted by MySQL Server for
classic MySQL protocol connections, which is specified by the
[`protocol_compression_algorithms`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_protocol_compression_algorithms)
server system variable. If you do not specify the
[`mysqlx_compression_algorithms`](x-plugin-options-system-variables.md#sysvar_mysqlx_compression_algorithms)
system variable, X Plugin does not fall back to using
compression settings for classic MySQL protocol connections. Instead,
its default is to permit all algorithms shown in
[Table 22.1, “X Protocol Compression Algorithm Characteristics”](x-plugin-connection-compression.md#x-plugin-connection-compression-algorithms "Table 22.1 X Protocol Compression Algorithm Characteristics").
This is unlike the situation for the TLS context, where MySQL
Server settings are used if the X Plugin system variables are
not set, as described in
[Section 22.5.3, “Using Encrypted Connections with X Plugin”](x-plugin-encrypted-connections.md "22.5.3 Using Encrypted Connections with X Plugin"). For
information about compression for classic MySQL protocol connections,
see [Section 6.2.8, “Connection Compression Control”](connection-compression-control.md "6.2.8 Connection Compression Control").

On the client side, an X Protocol connection request can
specify several parameters for compression control:

- The compression mode.
- The compression level (from MySQL 8.0.20).
- The list of permitted compression algorithms in priority
  order (from MySQL 8.0.22).

Note

Some clients or Connectors might not support a given
compression-control feature. For example, specifying
compression level for X Protocol connections is supported
only by MySQL Shell, not by other MySQL clients or
Connectors. See the documentation for specific products for
details about supported features and how to use them.

The connection mode has these permitted values:

- `disabled`: The connection is uncompressed.
- `preferred`: The server and client
  negotiate to find a compression algorithm they both permit.
  If no common algorithm is available, the connection is
  uncompressed. This is the default mode if not specified
  explicitly.
- `required`: Compression algorithm
  negotiation occurs as for `preferred` mode,
  but if no common algorithm is available, the connection
  request terminates with an error.

In addition to agreeing on a compression algorithm for each
connection, the server and client can agree on a compression
level from the numeric range that applies to the agreed
algorithm. As the compression level for an algorithm increases,
the data compression ratio increases, which reduces the network
bandwidth and transfer time needed to send the message to the
client. However, the effort required for data compression also
increases, taking up time and CPU and memory resources on the
server. Increases in the compression effort do not have a linear
relationship to increases in the compression ratio.

In MySQL 8.0.19, X Plugin always uses the library default
compression level for each algorithm (3 for zstd, 0 for LZ4, and
6 for Deflate), and the client cannot negotiate this. From MySQL
8.0.20, the client can request a specific compression level
during capability negotiations with the server for an
X Protocol connection.

The default compression levels used by X Plugin from MySQL
8.0.20 have been selected through performance testing as being a
good trade-off between compression time and network transit
time. These defaults are not necessarily the same as the library
default for each algorithm. They apply if the client does not
request a compression level for the algorithm. The default
compression levels are initially set to 3 for zstd, 2 for LZ4,
and 3 for Deflate. You can adjust these settings using the
[`mysqlx_zstd_default_compression_level`](x-plugin-options-system-variables.md#sysvar_mysqlx_zstd_default_compression_level),
[`mysqlx_lz4_default_compression_level`](x-plugin-options-system-variables.md#sysvar_mysqlx_lz4_default_compression_level),
and
[`mysqlx_deflate_default_compression_level`](x-plugin-options-system-variables.md#sysvar_mysqlx_deflate_default_compression_level)
system variables.

To prevent excessive resource consumption on the server,
X Plugin sets a maximum compression level that the server
permits for each algorithm. If a client requests a compression
level that exceeds this setting, the server uses its maximum
permitted compression level (compression level requests by a
client are supported only by MySQL Shell). The maximum
compression levels are initially set to 11 for zstd, 8 for LZ4,
and 5 for Deflate. You can adjust these settings using the
[`mysqlx_zstd_max_client_compression_level`](x-plugin-options-system-variables.md#sysvar_mysqlx_zstd_max_client_compression_level),
[`mysqlx_lz4_max_client_compression_level`](x-plugin-options-system-variables.md#sysvar_mysqlx_lz4_max_client_compression_level),
and
[`mysqlx_deflate_max_client_compression_level`](x-plugin-options-system-variables.md#sysvar_mysqlx_deflate_max_client_compression_level)
system variables.

If the server and client permit more than one algorithm in
common, the default priority order for choosing an algorithm
during negotiation is shown in
[Table 22.1, “X Protocol Compression Algorithm Characteristics”](x-plugin-connection-compression.md#x-plugin-connection-compression-algorithms "Table 22.1 X Protocol Compression Algorithm Characteristics").
From MySQL 8.0.22, for clients that support specifying
compression algorithms, the connection request can include a
list of algorithms permitted by the client, specified using the
algorithm name or its alias. The order of these algorithms in
the list is taken as a priority order by the server. The
algorithm used in this case is the first of those in the client
list that is also permitted on the server side. However, the
option for compression algorithms is subject to the compression
mode:

- If the compression mode is `disabled`, the
  compression algorithms option is ignored.
- If the compression mode is `preferred` but
  no algorithm permitted on the client side is permitted on
  the server side, the connection is uncompressed.
- If the compression mode is `required` but
  no algorithm permitted on the client side is permitted on
  the server side, an error occurs.

To monitor the effects of message compression, use the X Plugin
status variables described in
[Monitoring Connection Compression for X Plugin](x-plugin-connection-compression.md#x-plugin-connection-compression-monitoring "Monitoring Connection Compression for X Plugin").
You can use these status variables to calculate the benefit of
message compression with your current settings, and use that
information to tune your settings.

#### Compressed Connection Characteristics for X Plugin

X Protocol connection compression operates with the following
behaviors and boundaries:

- The `_stream` and
  `_message` suffixes in algorithm names
  refer to two different operational modes: In stream mode,
  all X Protocol messages in a single connection are
  compressed into a continuous stream and must be decompressed
  in the same manner—following the order they were
  compressed and without skipping any messages. In message
  mode, each message is compressed individually and
  independently, and need not be decompressed in the order in
  which they were compressed. Also, message mode does not
  require all compressed messages to be decompressed.
- Compression is not applied to any messages that are sent
  before authentication succeeds.
- Compression is not applied to control flow messages such as
  `Mysqlx.Ok`,
  `Mysqlx.Error`, and
  `Mysqlx.Sql.StmtExecuteOk` messages.
- All other X Protocol messages can be compressed if the
  server and client agree on a mutually permitted compression
  algorithm during capability negotiation. If the client does
  not request compression at that stage, neither the client
  nor the server applies compression to messages.
- When messages sent over X Protocol connections are
  compressed, the limit specified by the
  [`mysqlx_max_allowed_packet`](x-plugin-options-system-variables.md#sysvar_mysqlx_max_allowed_packet)
  system variable still applies. The network packet must be
  smaller than this limit after the message payload has been
  decompressed. If the limit is exceeded, X Plugin returns a
  decompression error and closes the connection.
- The following points pertain to compression level requests
  by clients, which is supported only by MySQL Shell:

  - Compression levels must be specified by the client as an
    integer. If any other type of value is supplied, the
    connection closes with an error.
  - If a client specifies an algorithm but not a compression
    level, the server uses its default compression level for
    the algorithm.
  - If a client requests an algorithm compression level that
    exceeds the server maximum permitted level, the server
    uses the maximum permitted level.
  - If a client requests an algorithm compression level that
    is less than the server minimum permitted level, the
    server uses the minimum permitted level.

#### Monitoring Connection Compression for X Plugin

You can monitor the effects of message compression using the
X Plugin status variables. When message compression is in use,
the session
[`Mysqlx_compression_algorithm`](x-plugin-status-variables.md#statvar_Mysqlx_compression_algorithm)
status variable shows which compression algorithm is in use for
the current X Protocol connection, and
[`Mysqlx_compression_level`](x-plugin-status-variables.md#statvar_Mysqlx_compression_level) shows
the compression level that was selected. These session status
variables are available from MySQL 8.0.20.

From MySQL 8.0.19, X Plugin status variables can be used to
calculate the efficiency of the compression algorithms that are
selected (the data compression ratio), and the overall effect of
using message compression. Use the session value of the status
variables in the following calculations to see what the benefit
of message compression was for a specific session with a known
compression algorithm. Or use the global value of the status
variables to check the overall benefit of message compression
for your server across all sessions using X Protocol
connections, including all the compression algorithms that have
been used for those sessions, and all sessions that did not use
message compression. You can then tune message compression by
adjusting the permitted compression algorithms, maximum
compression level, and default compression level, as described
in
[Configuring Connection Compression for X Plugin](x-plugin-connection-compression.md#x-plugin-connection-compression-configuration "Configuring Connection Compression for X Plugin").

When message compression is in use, the
[`Mysqlx_bytes_sent`](x-plugin-status-variables.md#statvar_Mysqlx_bytes_sent) status
variable shows the total number of bytes sent out from the
server, including compressed message payloads measured after
compression, any items in compressed messages that were not
compressed such as X Protocol headers, and any uncompressed
messages. The
[`Mysqlx_bytes_sent_compressed_payload`](x-plugin-status-variables.md#statvar_Mysqlx_bytes_sent_compressed_payload)
status variable shows the total number of bytes sent as
compressed message payloads, measured after compression, and the
[`Mysqlx_bytes_sent_uncompressed_frame`](x-plugin-status-variables.md#statvar_Mysqlx_bytes_sent_uncompressed_frame)
status variable shows the total number of bytes for those same
message payloads but measured before compression. The
compression ratio, which shows the efficiency of the compression
algorithm, can therefore be calculated using the following
expression:

```simple
mysqlx_bytes_sent_uncompressed_frame / mysqlx_bytes_sent_compressed_payload
```

The effectiveness of compression for X Protocol messages sent
by the server can be calculated using the following expression:

```simple
(mysqlx_bytes_sent - mysqlx_bytes_sent_compressed_payload + mysqlx_bytes_sent_uncompressed_frame) / mysqlx_bytes_sent
```

For messages received by the server from clients, the
[`Mysqlx_bytes_received_compressed_payload`](x-plugin-status-variables.md#statvar_Mysqlx_bytes_received_compressed_payload)
status variable shows the total number of bytes received as
compressed message payloads, measured before decompression, and
the
[`Mysqlx_bytes_received_uncompressed_frame`](x-plugin-status-variables.md#statvar_Mysqlx_bytes_received_uncompressed_frame)
status variable shows the total number of bytes for those same
message payloads but measured after decompression. The
[`Mysqlx_bytes_received`](x-plugin-status-variables.md#statvar_Mysqlx_bytes_received) status
variable includes compressed message payloads measured before
decompression, any uncompressed items in compressed messages,
and any uncompressed messages.
