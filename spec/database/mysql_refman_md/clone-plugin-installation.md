#### 7.6.7.1 Installing the Clone Plugin

This section describes how to install and configure the clone
plugin. For remote cloning operations, the clone plugin must be
installed on the donor and recipient MySQL server instances.

For general information about installing or uninstalling
plugins, see [Section 7.6.1, “Installing and Uninstalling Plugins”](plugin-loading.md "7.6.1 Installing and Uninstalling Plugins").

To be usable by the server, the plugin library file must be
located in the MySQL plugin directory (the directory named by
the [`plugin_dir`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_plugin_dir) system
variable). If necessary, set the value of
[`plugin_dir`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_plugin_dir) at server startup to
tell the server the plugin directory location.

The plugin library file base name is
`mysql_clone.so`. The file name suffix differs
by platform (for example, `.so` for Unix and
Unix-like systems, `.dll` for Windows).

To load the plugin at server startup, use the
[`--plugin-load-add`](server-options.md#option_mysqld_plugin-load-add) option to name
the library file that contains it. With this plugin-loading
method, the option must be given each time the server starts.
For example, put these lines in your `my.cnf`
file, adjusting the plugin library file name extension for your
platform as necessary. (The plugin library file name extension
depends on your platform. Common suffixes are
`.so` for Unix and Unix-like systems,
`.dll` for Windows.)

```ini
[mysqld]
plugin-load-add=mysql_clone.so
```

After modifying `my.cnf`, restart the server
to cause the new settings to take effect.

Note

The [`--plugin-load-add`](server-options.md#option_mysqld_plugin-load-add) option
cannot be used to load the clone plugin when restarting the
server during an upgrade from a previous MySQL version. For
example, after upgrading binaries or packages from MySQL 5.7
to MySQL 8.0, attempting to restart the server with
[`plugin-load-add=mysql_clone.so`](server-options.md#option_mysqld_plugin-load-add)
causes this error: [ERROR] [MY-013238] [Server]
Error installing plugin 'clone': Cannot install during
upgrade. The workaround is to upgrade the server
before attempting to start the server with
[`plugin-load-add=mysql_clone.so`](server-options.md#option_mysqld_plugin-load-add).

Alternatively, to load the plugin at runtime, use this
statement, adjusting the `.so` suffix for
your platform as necessary:

```sql
INSTALL PLUGIN clone SONAME 'mysql_clone.so';
```

[`INSTALL PLUGIN`](install-plugin.md "15.7.4.4 INSTALL PLUGIN Statement") loads the plugin,
and also registers it in the `mysql.plugins`
system table to cause the plugin to be loaded for each
subsequent normal server startup without the need for
[`--plugin-load-add`](server-options.md#option_mysqld_plugin-load-add).

To verify plugin installation, examine the Information Schema
[`PLUGINS`](information-schema-plugins-table.md "28.3.22 The INFORMATION_SCHEMA PLUGINS Table") table or use the
[`SHOW PLUGINS`](show-plugins.md "15.7.7.25 SHOW PLUGINS Statement") statement (see
[Section 7.6.2, “Obtaining Server Plugin Information”](obtaining-plugin-information.md "7.6.2 Obtaining Server Plugin Information")). For example:

```sql
mysql> SELECT PLUGIN_NAME, PLUGIN_STATUS
       FROM INFORMATION_SCHEMA.PLUGINS
       WHERE PLUGIN_NAME = 'clone';
+------------------------+---------------+
| PLUGIN_NAME            | PLUGIN_STATUS |
+------------------------+---------------+
| clone                  | ACTIVE        |
+------------------------+---------------+
```

If the plugin fails to initialize, check the server error log
for clone or plugin-related diagnostic messages.

If the plugin has been previously registered with
[`INSTALL PLUGIN`](install-plugin.md "15.7.4.4 INSTALL PLUGIN Statement") or is loaded with
[`--plugin-load-add`](server-options.md#option_mysqld_plugin-load-add), you can use
the `--clone` option at server startup to control
the plugin activation state. For example, to load the plugin at
startup and prevent it from being removed at runtime, use these
options:

```ini
[mysqld]
plugin-load-add=mysql_clone.so
clone=FORCE_PLUS_PERMANENT
```

If you want to prevent the server from running without the clone
plugin, use `--clone` with a value of
`FORCE` or
`FORCE_PLUS_PERMANENT` to force server startup
to fail if the plugin does not initialize successfully.

[Controlling Plugin Activation State](plugin-loading.md#server-plugin-activating "Controlling Plugin Activation State").
