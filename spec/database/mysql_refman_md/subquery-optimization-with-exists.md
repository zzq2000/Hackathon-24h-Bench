#### 10.2.2.3 Optimizing Subqueries with the EXISTS Strategy

Certain optimizations are applicable to comparisons that use
the `IN` (or `=ANY`)
operator to test subquery results. This section discusses
these optimizations, particularly with regard to the
challenges that `NULL` values present. The
last part of the discussion suggests how you can help the
optimizer.

Consider the following subquery comparison:

```sql
outer_expr IN (SELECT inner_expr FROM ... WHERE subquery_where)
```

MySQL evaluates queries “from outside to inside.”
That is, it first obtains the value of the outer expression
*`outer_expr`*, and then runs the
subquery and captures the rows that it produces.

A very useful optimization is to “inform” the
subquery that the only rows of interest are those where the
inner expression *`inner_expr`* is
equal to *`outer_expr`*. This is done
by pushing down an appropriate equality into the
subquery's `WHERE` clause to make it
more restrictive. The converted comparison looks like this:

```sql
EXISTS (SELECT 1 FROM ... WHERE subquery_where AND outer_expr=inner_expr)
```

After the conversion, MySQL can use the pushed-down equality
to limit the number of rows it must examine to evaluate the
subquery.

More generally, a comparison of *`N`*
values to a subquery that returns
*`N`*-value rows is subject to the same
conversion. If *`oe_i`* and
*`ie_i`* represent corresponding outer
and inner expression values, this subquery comparison:

```sql
(oe_1, ..., oe_N) IN
  (SELECT ie_1, ..., ie_N FROM ... WHERE subquery_where)
```

Becomes:

```sql
EXISTS (SELECT 1 FROM ... WHERE subquery_where
                          AND oe_1 = ie_1
                          AND ...
                          AND oe_N = ie_N)
```

For simplicity, the following discussion assumes a single pair
of outer and inner expression values.

The “pushdown” strategy just described works if
either of these conditions is true:

- *`outer_expr`* and
  *`inner_expr`* cannot be
  `NULL`.
- You need not distinguish `NULL` from
  `FALSE` subquery results. If the subquery
  is a part of an [`OR`](logical-operators.md#operator_or) or
  [`AND`](logical-operators.md#operator_and) expression in the
  `WHERE` clause, MySQL assumes that you do
  not care. Another instance where the optimizer notices
  that `NULL` and `FALSE`
  subquery results need not be distinguished is this
  construct:

  ```sql
  ... WHERE outer_expr IN (subquery)
  ```

  In this case, the `WHERE` clause rejects
  the row whether `IN
  (subquery)` returns
  `NULL` or `FALSE`.

Suppose that *`outer_expr`* is known to
be a non-`NULL` value but the subquery does
not produce a row such that
*`outer_expr`* =
*`inner_expr`*. Then
`outer_expr IN (SELECT
...)` evaluates as follows:

- `NULL`, if the
  [`SELECT`](select.md "15.2.13 SELECT Statement") produces any row
  where *`inner_expr`* is
  `NULL`
- `FALSE`, if the
  [`SELECT`](select.md "15.2.13 SELECT Statement") produces only
  non-`NULL` values or produces nothing

In this situation, the approach of looking for rows with
`outer_expr =
inner_expr` is no longer
valid. It is necessary to look for such rows, but if none are
found, also look for rows where
*`inner_expr`* is
`NULL`. Roughly speaking, the subquery can be
converted to something like this:

```sql
EXISTS (SELECT 1 FROM ... WHERE subquery_where AND
        (outer_expr=inner_expr OR inner_expr IS NULL))
```

The need to evaluate the extra [`IS
NULL`](comparison-operators.md#operator_is-null) condition is why MySQL has the
[`ref_or_null`](explain-output.md#jointype_ref_or_null) access method:

```sql
mysql> EXPLAIN
       SELECT outer_expr IN (SELECT t2.maybe_null_key
                             FROM t2, t3 WHERE ...)
       FROM t1;
*************************** 1. row ***************************
           id: 1
  select_type: PRIMARY
        table: t1
...
*************************** 2. row ***************************
           id: 2
  select_type: DEPENDENT SUBQUERY
        table: t2
         type: ref_or_null
possible_keys: maybe_null_key
          key: maybe_null_key
      key_len: 5
          ref: func
         rows: 2
        Extra: Using where; Using index
...
```

The [`unique_subquery`](explain-output.md#jointype_unique_subquery) and
[`index_subquery`](explain-output.md#jointype_index_subquery)
subquery-specific access methods also have “or
`NULL`” variants.

The additional `OR ... IS NULL` condition
makes query execution slightly more complicated (and some
optimizations within the subquery become inapplicable), but
generally this is tolerable.

The situation is much worse when
*`outer_expr`* can be
`NULL`. According to the SQL interpretation
of `NULL` as “unknown value,”
`NULL IN (SELECT inner_expr
...)` should evaluate to:

- `NULL`, if the
  [`SELECT`](select.md "15.2.13 SELECT Statement") produces any rows
- `FALSE`, if the
  [`SELECT`](select.md "15.2.13 SELECT Statement") produces no rows

For proper evaluation, it is necessary to be able to check
whether the [`SELECT`](select.md "15.2.13 SELECT Statement") has produced
any rows at all, so
`outer_expr =
inner_expr` cannot be
pushed down into the subquery. This is a problem because many
real world subqueries become very slow unless the equality can
be pushed down.

Essentially, there must be different ways to execute the
subquery depending on the value of
*`outer_expr`*.

The optimizer chooses SQL compliance over speed, so it
accounts for the possibility that
*`outer_expr`* might be
`NULL`:

- If *`outer_expr`* is
  `NULL`, to evaluate the following
  expression, it is necessary to execute the
  [`SELECT`](select.md "15.2.13 SELECT Statement") to determine whether
  it produces any rows:

  ```sql
  NULL IN (SELECT inner_expr FROM ... WHERE subquery_where)
  ```

  It is necessary to execute the original
  [`SELECT`](select.md "15.2.13 SELECT Statement") here, without any
  pushed-down equalities of the kind mentioned previously.
- On the other hand, when
  *`outer_expr`* is not
  `NULL`, it is absolutely essential that
  this comparison:

  ```sql
  outer_expr IN (SELECT inner_expr FROM ... WHERE subquery_where)
  ```

  Be converted to this expression that uses a pushed-down
  condition:

  ```sql
  EXISTS (SELECT 1 FROM ... WHERE subquery_where AND outer_expr=inner_expr)
  ```

  Without this conversion, subqueries are slow.

To solve the dilemma of whether or not to push down conditions
into the subquery, the conditions are wrapped within
“trigger” functions. Thus, an expression of the
following form:

```sql
outer_expr IN (SELECT inner_expr FROM ... WHERE subquery_where)
```

Is converted into:

```sql
EXISTS (SELECT 1 FROM ... WHERE subquery_where
                          AND trigcond(outer_expr=inner_expr))
```

More generally, if the subquery comparison is based on several
pairs of outer and inner expressions, the conversion takes
this comparison:

```sql
(oe_1, ..., oe_N) IN (SELECT ie_1, ..., ie_N FROM ... WHERE subquery_where)
```

And converts it to this expression:

```sql
EXISTS (SELECT 1 FROM ... WHERE subquery_where
                          AND trigcond(oe_1=ie_1)
                          AND ...
                          AND trigcond(oe_N=ie_N)
       )
```

Each `trigcond(X)`
is a special function that evaluates to the following values:

- *`X`* when the
  “linked” outer expression
  *`oe_i`* is not
  `NULL`
- `TRUE` when the “linked”
  outer expression *`oe_i`* is
  `NULL`

Note

Trigger functions are *not* triggers of
the kind that you create with [`CREATE
TRIGGER`](create-trigger.md "15.1.22 CREATE TRIGGER Statement").

Equalities that are wrapped within
`trigcond()` functions are not first class
predicates for the query optimizer. Most optimizations cannot
deal with predicates that may be turned on and off at query
execution time, so they assume any
`trigcond(X)` to
be an unknown function and ignore it. Triggered equalities can
be used by those optimizations:

- Reference optimizations:
  `trigcond(X=Y
  [OR Y IS NULL])` can
  be used to construct
  [`ref`](explain-output.md#jointype_ref),
  [`eq_ref`](explain-output.md#jointype_eq_ref), or
  [`ref_or_null`](explain-output.md#jointype_ref_or_null) table
  accesses.
- Index lookup-based subquery execution engines:
  `trigcond(X=Y)`
  can be used to construct
  [`unique_subquery`](explain-output.md#jointype_unique_subquery) or
  [`index_subquery`](explain-output.md#jointype_index_subquery)
  accesses.
- Table-condition generator: If the subquery is a join of
  several tables, the triggered condition is checked as soon
  as possible.

When the optimizer uses a triggered condition to create some
kind of index lookup-based access (as for the first two items
of the preceding list), it must have a fallback strategy for
the case when the condition is turned off. This fallback
strategy is always the same: Do a full table scan. In
[`EXPLAIN`](explain.md "15.8.2 EXPLAIN Statement") output, the fallback
shows up as `Full scan on NULL key` in the
`Extra` column:

```sql
mysql> EXPLAIN SELECT t1.col1,
       t1.col1 IN (SELECT t2.key1 FROM t2 WHERE t2.col2=t1.col2) FROM t1\G
*************************** 1. row ***************************
           id: 1
  select_type: PRIMARY
        table: t1
        ...
*************************** 2. row ***************************
           id: 2
  select_type: DEPENDENT SUBQUERY
        table: t2
         type: index_subquery
possible_keys: key1
          key: key1
      key_len: 5
          ref: func
         rows: 2
        Extra: Using where; Full scan on NULL key
```

If you run [`EXPLAIN`](explain.md "15.8.2 EXPLAIN Statement") followed by
[`SHOW WARNINGS`](show-warnings.md "15.7.7.42 SHOW WARNINGS Statement"), you can see the
triggered condition:

```none
*************************** 1. row ***************************
  Level: Note
   Code: 1003
Message: select `test`.`t1`.`col1` AS `col1`,
         <in_optimizer>(`test`.`t1`.`col1`,
         <exists>(<index_lookup>(<cache>(`test`.`t1`.`col1`) in t2
         on key1 checking NULL
         where (`test`.`t2`.`col2` = `test`.`t1`.`col2`) having
         trigcond(<is_not_null_test>(`test`.`t2`.`key1`))))) AS
         `t1.col1 IN (select t2.key1 from t2 where t2.col2=t1.col2)`
         from `test`.`t1`
```

The use of triggered conditions has some performance
implications. A `NULL IN (SELECT ...)`
expression now may cause a full table scan (which is slow)
when it previously did not. This is the price paid for correct
results (the goal of the trigger-condition strategy is to
improve compliance, not speed).

For multiple-table subqueries, execution of `NULL IN
(SELECT ...)` is particularly slow because the join
optimizer does not optimize for the case where the outer
expression is `NULL`. It assumes that
subquery evaluations with `NULL` on the left
side are very rare, even if there are statistics that indicate
otherwise. On the other hand, if the outer expression might be
`NULL` but never actually is, there is no
performance penalty.

To help the query optimizer better execute your queries, use
these suggestions:

- Declare a column as `NOT NULL` if it
  really is. This also helps other aspects of the optimizer
  by simplifying condition testing for the column.
- If you need not distinguish a `NULL` from
  `FALSE` subquery result, you can easily
  avoid the slow execution path. Replace a comparison that
  looks like this:

  ```sql
  outer_expr [NOT] IN (SELECT inner_expr FROM ...)
  ```

  with this expression:

  ```sql
  (outer_expr IS NOT NULL) AND (outer_expr [NOT] IN (SELECT inner_expr FROM ...))
  ```

  Then `NULL IN (SELECT ...)` is never
  evaluated because MySQL stops evaluating
  [`AND`](logical-operators.md#operator_and) parts as soon as the
  expression result is clear.

  Another possible rewrite:

  ```sql
  [NOT] EXISTS (SELECT inner_expr FROM ...
          WHERE inner_expr=outer_expr)
  ```

The
[`subquery_materialization_cost_based`](switchable-optimizations.md#optflag_subquery-materialization-cost-based)
flag of the [`optimizer_switch`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_optimizer_switch)
system variable enables control over the choice between
subquery materialization and
`IN`-to-`EXISTS` subquery
transformation. See
[Section 10.9.2, “Switchable Optimizations”](switchable-optimizations.md "10.9.2 Switchable Optimizations").
