#### 8.4.1.5 PAM Pluggable Authentication

Note

PAM pluggable authentication is an extension included in
MySQL Enterprise Edition, a commercial product. To learn more about commercial
products, see <https://www.mysql.com/products/>.

MySQL Enterprise Edition supports an authentication method that enables MySQL
Server to use PAM (Pluggable Authentication Modules) to
authenticate MySQL users. PAM enables a system to use a standard
interface to access various kinds of authentication methods,
such as traditional Unix passwords or an LDAP directory.

PAM pluggable authentication provides these capabilities:

- External authentication: PAM authentication enables MySQL
  Server to accept connections from users defined outside the
  MySQL grant tables and that authenticate using methods
  supported by PAM.
- Proxy user support: PAM authentication can return to MySQL a
  user name different from the external user name passed by
  the client program, based on the PAM groups the external
  user is a member of and the authentication string provided.
  This means that the plugin can return the MySQL user that
  defines the privileges the external PAM-authenticated user
  should have. For example, an operating system user named
  `joe` can connect and have the privileges
  of a MySQL user named `developer`.

PAM pluggable authentication has been tested on Linux and macOS;
note that Windows does not support PAM.

The following table shows the plugin and library file names. The
file name suffix might differ on your system. The file must be
located in the directory named by the
[`plugin_dir`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_plugin_dir) system variable. For
installation information, see
[Installing PAM Pluggable Authentication](pam-pluggable-authentication.md#pam-pluggable-authentication-installation "Installing PAM Pluggable Authentication").

**Table 8.20 Plugin and Library Names for PAM Authentication**

| Plugin or File | Plugin or File Name |
| --- | --- |
| Server-side plugin | `authentication_pam` |
| Client-side plugin | `mysql_clear_password` |
| Library file | `authentication_pam.so` |

The client-side `mysql_clear_password`
cleartext plugin that communicates with the server-side PAM
plugin is built into the `libmysqlclient`
client library and is included in all distributions, including
community distributions. Inclusion of the client-side cleartext
plugin in all MySQL distributions enables clients from any
distribution to connect to a server that has the server-side PAM
plugin loaded.

##### How PAM Authentication of MySQL Users Works

This section provides an overview of how MySQL and PAM work
together to authenticate MySQL users. For examples showing how
to set up MySQL accounts to use specific PAM services, see
[Using PAM Pluggable Authentication](pam-pluggable-authentication.md#pam-pluggable-authentication-usage "Using PAM Pluggable Authentication").

1. The client program and the server communicate, with the
   client sending to the server the client user name (the
   operating system user name by default) and password:

   - The client user name is the external user name.
   - For accounts that use the PAM server-side
     authentication plugin, the corresponding client-side
     plugin is `mysql_clear_password`.
     This client-side plugin performs no password hashing,
     with the result that the client sends the password to
     the server as cleartext.
2. The server finds a matching MySQL account based on the
   external user name and the host from which the client
   connects. The PAM plugin uses the information passed to it
   by MySQL Server (such as user name, host name, password,
   and authentication string). When you define a MySQL
   account that authenticates using PAM, the authentication
   string contains:

   - A PAM service name, which is a name that the system
     administrator can use to refer to an authentication
     method for a particular application. There can be
     multiple applications associated with a single
     database server instance, so the choice of service
     name is left to the SQL application developer.
   - Optionally, if proxying is to be used, a mapping from
     PAM groups to MySQL user names.
3. The plugin uses the PAM service named in the
   authentication string to check the user credentials and
   returns `'Authentication succeeded, Username is
   user_name'` or
   `'Authentication failed'`. The password
   must be appropriate for the password store used by the PAM
   service. Examples:

   - For traditional Unix passwords, the service looks up
     passwords stored in the
     `/etc/shadow` file.
   - For LDAP, the service looks up passwords stored in an
     LDAP directory.

   If the credentials check fails, the server refuses the
   connection.
4. Otherwise, the authentication string indicates whether
   proxying occurs. If the string contains no PAM group
   mapping, proxying does not occur. In this case, the MySQL
   user name is the same as the external user name.
5. Otherwise, proxying is indicated based on the PAM group
   mapping, with the MySQL user name determined based on the
   first matching group in the mapping list. The meaning of
   “PAM group” depends on the PAM service.
   Examples:

   - For traditional Unix passwords, groups are Unix groups
     defined in the `/etc/group` file,
     possibly supplemented with additional PAM information
     in a file such as
     `/etc/security/group.conf`.
   - For LDAP, groups are LDAP groups defined in an LDAP
     directory.

   If the proxy user (the external user) has the
   [`PROXY`](privileges-provided.md#priv_proxy) privilege for the
   proxied MySQL user name, proxying occurs, with the proxy
   user assuming the privileges of the proxied user.

##### Installing PAM Pluggable Authentication

This section describes how to install the server-side PAM
authentication plugin. For general information about
installing plugins, see [Section 7.6.1, “Installing and Uninstalling Plugins”](plugin-loading.md "7.6.1 Installing and Uninstalling Plugins").

To be usable by the server, the plugin library file must be
located in the MySQL plugin directory (the directory named by
the [`plugin_dir`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_plugin_dir) system
variable). If necessary, configure the plugin directory
location by setting the value of
[`plugin_dir`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_plugin_dir) at server startup.

The plugin library file base name is
`authentication_pam`, and is typically
compiled with the `.so` suffix.

To load the plugin at server startup, use the
[`--plugin-load-add`](server-options.md#option_mysqld_plugin-load-add) option to
name the library file that contains it. With this
plugin-loading method, the option must be given each time the
server starts. For example, put these lines in the server
`my.cnf` file:

```ini
[mysqld]
plugin-load-add=authentication_pam.so
```

After modifying `my.cnf`, restart the
server to cause the new settings to take effect.

Alternatively, to load the plugin at runtime, use this
statement, adjusting the `.so` suffix as
necessary:

```sql
INSTALL PLUGIN authentication_pam SONAME 'authentication_pam.so';
```

[`INSTALL PLUGIN`](install-plugin.md "15.7.4.4 INSTALL PLUGIN Statement") loads the plugin
immediately, and also registers it in the
`mysql.plugins` system table to cause the
server to load it for each subsequent normal startup without
the need for [`--plugin-load-add`](server-options.md#option_mysqld_plugin-load-add).

To verify plugin installation, examine the Information Schema
[`PLUGINS`](information-schema-plugins-table.md "28.3.22 The INFORMATION_SCHEMA PLUGINS Table") table or use the
[`SHOW PLUGINS`](show-plugins.md "15.7.7.25 SHOW PLUGINS Statement") statement (see
[Section 7.6.2, “Obtaining Server Plugin Information”](obtaining-plugin-information.md "7.6.2 Obtaining Server Plugin Information")). For example:

```sql
mysql> SELECT PLUGIN_NAME, PLUGIN_STATUS
       FROM INFORMATION_SCHEMA.PLUGINS
       WHERE PLUGIN_NAME LIKE '%pam%';
+--------------------+---------------+
| PLUGIN_NAME        | PLUGIN_STATUS |
+--------------------+---------------+
| authentication_pam | ACTIVE        |
+--------------------+---------------+
```

If the plugin fails to initialize, check the server error log
for diagnostic messages.

To associate MySQL accounts with the PAM plugin, see
[Using PAM Pluggable Authentication](pam-pluggable-authentication.md#pam-pluggable-authentication-usage "Using PAM Pluggable Authentication").

##### Uninstalling PAM Pluggable Authentication

The method used to uninstall the PAM authentication plugin
depends on how you installed it:

- If you installed the plugin at server startup using a
  [`--plugin-load-add`](server-options.md#option_mysqld_plugin-load-add) option,
  restart the server without the option.
- If you installed the plugin at runtime using an
  [`INSTALL PLUGIN`](install-plugin.md "15.7.4.4 INSTALL PLUGIN Statement") statement,
  it remains installed across server restarts. To uninstall
  it, use [`UNINSTALL PLUGIN`](uninstall-plugin.md "15.7.4.6 UNINSTALL PLUGIN Statement"):

  ```sql
  UNINSTALL PLUGIN authentication_pam;
  ```

##### Using PAM Pluggable Authentication

This section describes in general terms how to use the PAM
authentication plugin to connect from MySQL client programs to
the server. The following sections provide instructions for
using PAM authentication in specific ways. It is assumed that
the server is running with the server-side PAM plugin enabled,
as described in
[Installing PAM Pluggable Authentication](pam-pluggable-authentication.md#pam-pluggable-authentication-installation "Installing PAM Pluggable Authentication").

To refer to the PAM authentication plugin in the
`IDENTIFIED WITH` clause of a
[`CREATE USER`](create-user.md "15.7.1.3 CREATE USER Statement") statement, use the
name `authentication_pam`. For example:

```sql
CREATE USER user
  IDENTIFIED WITH authentication_pam
  AS 'auth_string';
```

The authentication string specifies the following types of
information:

- The PAM service name (see
  [How PAM Authentication of MySQL Users Works](pam-pluggable-authentication.md#pam-pluggable-authentication-process "How PAM Authentication of MySQL Users Works")).
  Examples in the following discussion use a service name of
  `mysql-unix` for authentication using
  traditional Unix passwords, and
  `mysql-ldap` for authentication using
  LDAP.
- For proxy support, PAM provides a way for a PAM module to
  return to the server a MySQL user name other than the
  external user name passed by the client program when it
  connects to the server. Use the authentication string to
  control the mapping from external user names to MySQL user
  names. If you want to take advantage of proxy user
  capabilities, the authentication string must include this
  kind of mapping.

For example, if an account uses the
`mysql-unix` PAM service name and should map
operating system users in the `root` and
`users` PAM groups to the
`developer` and `data_entry`
MySQL users, respectively, use a statement like this:

```sql
CREATE USER user
  IDENTIFIED WITH authentication_pam
  AS 'mysql-unix, root=developer, users=data_entry';
```

Authentication string syntax for the PAM authentication plugin
follows these rules:

- The string consists of a PAM service name, optionally
  followed by a PAM group mapping list consisting of one or
  more keyword/value pairs each specifying a PAM group name
  and a MySQL user name:

  ```none
  pam_service_name[,pam_group_name=mysql_user_name]...
  ```

  The plugin parses the authentication string for each
  connection attempt that uses the account. To minimize
  overhead, keep the string as short as possible.
- Each
  `pam_group_name=mysql_user_name`
  pair must be preceded by a comma.
- Leading and trailing spaces not inside double quotation
  marks are ignored.
- Unquoted *`pam_service_name`*,
  *`pam_group_name`*, and
  *`mysql_user_name`* values can
  contain anything except equal sign, comma, or space.
- If a *`pam_service_name`*,
  *`pam_group_name`*, or
  *`mysql_user_name`* value is quoted
  with double quotation marks, everything between the
  quotation marks is part of the value. This is necessary,
  for example, if the value contains space characters. All
  characters are legal except double quotation mark and
  backslash (`\`). To include either
  character, escape it with a backslash.

If the plugin successfully authenticates the external user
name (the name passed by the client), it looks for a PAM group
mapping list in the authentication string and, if present,
uses it to return a different MySQL user name to the MySQL
server based on which PAM groups the external user is a member
of:

- If the authentication string contains no PAM group mapping
  list, the plugin returns the external name.
- If the authentication string does contain a PAM group
  mapping list, the plugin examines each
  `pam_group_name=mysql_user_name`
  pair in the list from left to right and tries to find a
  match for the *`pam_group_name`*
  value in a non-MySQL directory of the groups assigned to
  the authenticated user and returns
  *`mysql_user_name`* for the first
  match it finds. If the plugin finds no match for any PAM
  group, it returns the external name. If the plugin is not
  capable of looking up a group in a directory, it ignores
  the PAM group mapping list and returns the external name.

The following sections describe how to set up several
authentication scenarios that use the PAM authentication
plugin:

- No proxy users. This uses PAM only to check login names
  and passwords. Every external user permitted to connect to
  MySQL Server should have a matching MySQL account that is
  defined to use PAM authentication. (For a MySQL account of
  `'user_name'@'host_name'`
  to match the external user,
  *`user_name`* must be the external
  user name and *`host_name`* must
  match the host from which the client connects.)
  Authentication can be performed by various PAM-supported
  methods. Later discussion shows how to authenticate client
  credentials using traditional Unix passwords, and
  passwords in LDAP.

  PAM authentication, when not done through proxy users or
  PAM groups, requires the MySQL user name to be same as the
  operating system user name. MySQL user names are limited
  to 32 characters (see [Section 8.2.3, “Grant Tables”](grant-tables.md "8.2.3 Grant Tables")),
  which limits PAM nonproxy authentication to Unix accounts
  with names of at most 32 characters.
- Proxy users only, with PAM group mapping. For this
  scenario, create one or more MySQL accounts that define
  different sets of privileges. (Ideally, nobody should
  connect using those accounts directly.) Then define a
  default user authenticating through PAM that uses some
  mapping scheme (usually based on the external PAM groups
  the users are members of) to map all the external user
  names to the few MySQL accounts holding the privilege
  sets. Any client who connects and specifies an external
  user name as the client user name is mapped to one of the
  MySQL accounts and uses its privileges. The discussion
  shows how to set this up using traditional Unix passwords,
  but other PAM methods such as LDAP could be used instead.

Variations on these scenarios are possible:

- You can permit some users to log in directly (without
  proxying) but require others to connect through proxy
  accounts.
- You can use one PAM authentication method for some users,
  and another method for other users, by using differing PAM
  service names among your PAM-authenticated accounts. For
  example, you can use the `mysql-unix` PAM
  service for some users, and `mysql-ldap`
  for others.

The examples make the following assumptions. You might need to
make some adjustments if your system is set up differently.

- The login name and password are `antonio`
  and *`antonio_password`*,
  respectively. Change these to correspond to the user you
  want to authenticate.
- The PAM configuration directory is
  `/etc/pam.d`.
- The PAM service name corresponds to the authentication
  method (`mysql-unix` or
  `mysql-ldap` in this discussion). To use
  a given PAM service, you must set up a PAM file with the
  same name in the PAM configuration directory (creating the
  file if it does not exist). In addition, you must name the
  PAM service in the authentication string of the
  [`CREATE USER`](create-user.md "15.7.1.3 CREATE USER Statement") statement for
  any account that authenticates using that PAM service.

The PAM authentication plugin checks at initialization time
whether the `AUTHENTICATION_PAM_LOG`
environment value is set in the server's startup
environment. If so, the plugin enables logging of diagnostic
messages to the standard output. Depending on how your server
is started, the message might appear on the console or in the
error log. These messages can be helpful for debugging
PAM-related issues that occur when the plugin performs
authentication. For more information, see
[PAM Authentication Debugging](pam-pluggable-authentication.md#pam-pluggable-authentication-debugging "PAM Authentication Debugging").

##### PAM Unix Password Authentication without Proxy Users

This authentication scenario uses PAM to check external users
defined in terms of operating system user names and Unix
passwords, without proxying. Every such external user
permitted to connect to MySQL Server should have a matching
MySQL account that is defined to use PAM authentication
through traditional Unix password store.

Note

Traditional Unix passwords are checked using the
`/etc/shadow` file. For information
regarding possible issues related to this file, see
[PAM Authentication Access to Unix Password Store](pam-pluggable-authentication.md#pam-authentication-unix-password-store "PAM Authentication Access to Unix Password Store").

1. Verify that Unix authentication permits logins to the
   operating system with the user name
   `antonio` and password
   *`antonio_password`*.
2. Set up PAM to authenticate MySQL connections using
   traditional Unix passwords by creating a
   `mysql-unix` PAM service file named
   `/etc/pam.d/mysql-unix`. The file
   contents are system dependent, so check existing
   login-related files in the `/etc/pam.d`
   directory to see what they look like. On Linux, the
   `mysql-unix` file might look like this:

   ```none
   #%PAM-1.0
   auth            include         password-auth
   account         include         password-auth
   ```

   For macOS, use `login` rather than
   `password-auth`.

   The PAM file format might differ on some systems. For
   example, on Ubuntu and other Debian-based systems, use
   these file contents instead:

   ```none
   @include common-auth
   @include common-account
   @include common-session-noninteractive
   ```
3. Create a MySQL account with the same user name as the
   operating system user name and define it to authenticate
   using the PAM plugin and the `mysql-unix`
   PAM service:

   ```sql
   CREATE USER 'antonio'@'localhost'
     IDENTIFIED WITH authentication_pam
     AS 'mysql-unix';
   GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES
     ON mydb.*
     TO 'antonio'@'localhost';
   ```

   Here, the authentication string contains only the PAM
   service name, `mysql-unix`, which
   authenticates Unix passwords.
4. Use the [**mysql**](mysql.md "6.5.1 mysql — The MySQL Command-Line Client") command-line client to
   connect to the MySQL server as `antonio`.
   For example:

   ```terminal
   $> mysql --user=antonio --password --enable-cleartext-plugin
   Enter password: antonio_password
   ```

   The server should permit the connection and the following
   query returns output as shown:

   ```sql
   mysql> SELECT USER(), CURRENT_USER(), @@proxy_user;
   +-------------------+-------------------+--------------+
   | USER()            | CURRENT_USER()    | @@proxy_user |
   +-------------------+-------------------+--------------+
   | antonio@localhost | antonio@localhost | NULL         |
   +-------------------+-------------------+--------------+
   ```

   This demonstrates that the `antonio`
   operating system user is authenticated to have the
   privileges granted to the `antonio` MySQL
   user, and that no proxying has occurred.

Note

The client-side `mysql_clear_password`
authentication plugin leaves the password untouched, so
client programs send it to the MySQL server as cleartext.
This enables the password to be passed as is to PAM. A
cleartext password is necessary to use the server-side PAM
library, but may be a security problem in some
configurations. These measures minimize the risk:

- To make inadvertent use of the
  `mysql_clear_password` plugin less
  likely, MySQL clients must explicitly enable it (for
  example, with the
  `--enable-cleartext-plugin` option). See
  [Section 8.4.1.4, “Client-Side Cleartext Pluggable Authentication”](cleartext-pluggable-authentication.md "8.4.1.4 Client-Side Cleartext Pluggable Authentication").
- To avoid password exposure with the
  `mysql_clear_password` plugin enabled,
  MySQL clients should connect to the MySQL server using
  an encrypted connection. See
  [Section 8.3.1, “Configuring MySQL to Use Encrypted Connections”](using-encrypted-connections.md "8.3.1 Configuring MySQL to Use Encrypted Connections").

##### PAM LDAP Authentication without Proxy Users

This authentication scenario uses PAM to check external users
defined in terms of operating system user names and LDAP
passwords, without proxying. Every such external user
permitted to connect to MySQL Server should have a matching
MySQL account that is defined to use PAM authentication
through LDAP.

To use PAM LDAP pluggable authentication for MySQL, these
prerequisites must be satisfied:

- An LDAP server must be available for the PAM LDAP service
  to communicate with.
- Each LDAP user to be authenticated by MySQL must be
  present in the directory managed by the LDAP server.

Note

Another way to use LDAP for MySQL user authentication is to
use the LDAP-specific authentication plugins. See
[Section 8.4.1.7, “LDAP Pluggable Authentication”](ldap-pluggable-authentication.md "8.4.1.7 LDAP Pluggable Authentication").

Configure MySQL for PAM LDAP authentication as follows:

1. Verify that Unix authentication permits logins to the
   operating system with the user name
   `antonio` and password
   *`antonio_password`*.
2. Set up PAM to authenticate MySQL connections using LDAP by
   creating a `mysql-ldap` PAM service file
   named `/etc/pam.d/mysql-ldap`. The file
   contents are system dependent, so check existing
   login-related files in the `/etc/pam.d`
   directory to see what they look like. On Linux, the
   `mysql-ldap` file might look like this:

   ```none
   #%PAM-1.0
   auth        required    pam_ldap.so
   account     required    pam_ldap.so
   ```

   If PAM object files have a suffix different from
   `.so` on your system, substitute the
   correct suffix.

   The PAM file format might differ on some systems.
3. Create a MySQL account with the same user name as the
   operating system user name and define it to authenticate
   using the PAM plugin and the `mysql-ldap`
   PAM service:

   ```sql
   CREATE USER 'antonio'@'localhost'
     IDENTIFIED WITH authentication_pam
     AS 'mysql-ldap';
   GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES
     ON mydb.*
     TO 'antonio'@'localhost';
   ```

   Here, the authentication string contains only the PAM
   service name, `mysql-ldap`, which
   authenticates using LDAP.
4. Connecting to the server is the same as described in
   [PAM Unix Password Authentication without Proxy Users](pam-pluggable-authentication.md#pam-authentication-unix-without-proxy "PAM Unix Password Authentication without Proxy Users").

##### PAM Unix Password Authentication with Proxy Users and Group Mapping

The authentication scheme described here uses proxying and PAM
group mapping to map connecting MySQL users who authenticate
using PAM onto other MySQL accounts that define different sets
of privileges. Users do not connect directly through the
accounts that define the privileges. Instead, they connect
through a default proxy account authenticated using PAM, such
that all the external users are mapped to the MySQL accounts
that hold the privileges. Any user who connects using the
proxy account is mapped to one of those MySQL accounts, the
privileges for which determine the database operations
permitted to the external user.

The procedure shown here uses Unix password authentication. To
use LDAP instead, see the early steps of
[PAM LDAP Authentication without Proxy Users](pam-pluggable-authentication.md#pam-authentication-ldap-without-proxy "PAM LDAP Authentication without Proxy Users").

Note

Traditional Unix passwords are checked using the
`/etc/shadow` file. For information
regarding possible issues related to this file, see
[PAM Authentication Access to Unix Password Store](pam-pluggable-authentication.md#pam-authentication-unix-password-store "PAM Authentication Access to Unix Password Store").

1. Verify that Unix authentication permits logins to the
   operating system with the user name
   `antonio` and password
   *`antonio_password`*.
2. Verify that `antonio` is a member of the
   `root` or `users` PAM
   group.
3. Set up PAM to authenticate the
   `mysql-unix` PAM service through
   operating system users by creating a file named
   `/etc/pam.d/mysql-unix`. The file
   contents are system dependent, so check existing
   login-related files in the `/etc/pam.d`
   directory to see what they look like. On Linux, the
   `mysql-unix` file might look like this:

   ```none
   #%PAM-1.0
   auth            include         password-auth
   account         include         password-auth
   ```

   For macOS, use `login` rather than
   `password-auth`.

   The PAM file format might differ on some systems. For
   example, on Ubuntu and other Debian-based systems, use
   these file contents instead:

   ```none
   @include common-auth
   @include common-account
   @include common-session-noninteractive
   ```
4. Create a default proxy user (`''@''`)
   that maps external PAM users to the proxied accounts:

   ```sql
   CREATE USER ''@''
     IDENTIFIED WITH authentication_pam
     AS 'mysql-unix, root=developer, users=data_entry';
   ```

   Here, the authentication string contains the PAM service
   name, `mysql-unix`, which authenticates
   Unix passwords. The authentication string also maps
   external users in the `root` and
   `users` PAM groups to the
   `developer` and
   `data_entry` MySQL user names,
   respectively.

   The PAM group mapping list following the PAM service name
   is required when you set up proxy users. Otherwise, the
   plugin cannot tell how to perform mapping from external
   user names to the proper proxied MySQL user names.

   Note

   If your MySQL installation has anonymous users, they
   might conflict with the default proxy user. For more
   information about this issue, and ways of dealing with
   it, see [Default Proxy User and Anonymous User Conflicts](proxy-users.md#proxy-users-conflicts "Default Proxy User and Anonymous User Conflicts").
5. Create the proxied accounts and grant to each one the
   privileges it should have:

   ```sql
   CREATE USER 'developer'@'localhost'
     IDENTIFIED WITH mysql_no_login;
   CREATE USER 'data_entry'@'localhost'
     IDENTIFIED WITH mysql_no_login;

   GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES
     ON mydevdb.*
     TO 'developer'@'localhost';
   GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES
     ON mydb.*
     TO 'data_entry'@'localhost';
   ```

   The proxied accounts use the
   `mysql_no_login` authentication plugin to
   prevent clients from using the accounts to log in directly
   to the MySQL server. Instead, users who authenticate using
   PAM are expected to use the `developer`
   or `data_entry` account by proxy based on
   their PAM group. (This assumes that the plugin is
   installed. For instructions, see
   [Section 8.4.1.9, “No-Login Pluggable Authentication”](no-login-pluggable-authentication.md "8.4.1.9 No-Login Pluggable Authentication").) For
   alternative methods of protecting proxied accounts against
   direct use, see
   [Preventing Direct Login to Proxied Accounts](proxy-users.md#preventing-proxied-account-direct-login "Preventing Direct Login to Proxied Accounts").
6. Grant to the proxy account the
   [`PROXY`](privileges-provided.md#priv_proxy) privilege for each
   proxied account:

   ```sql
   GRANT PROXY
     ON 'developer'@'localhost'
     TO ''@'';
   GRANT PROXY
     ON 'data_entry'@'localhost'
     TO ''@'';
   ```
7. Use the [**mysql**](mysql.md "6.5.1 mysql — The MySQL Command-Line Client") command-line client to
   connect to the MySQL server as `antonio`.

   ```terminal
   $> mysql --user=antonio --password --enable-cleartext-plugin
   Enter password: antonio_password
   ```

   The server authenticates the connection using the default
   `''@''` proxy account. The resulting
   privileges for `antonio` depend on which
   PAM groups `antonio` is a member of. If
   `antonio` is a member of the
   `root` PAM group, the PAM plugin maps
   `root` to the
   `developer` MySQL user name and returns
   that name to the server. The server verifies that
   `''@''` has the
   [`PROXY`](privileges-provided.md#priv_proxy) privilege for
   `developer` and permits the connection.
   The following query returns output as shown:

   ```sql
   mysql> SELECT USER(), CURRENT_USER(), @@proxy_user;
   +-------------------+---------------------+--------------+
   | USER()            | CURRENT_USER()      | @@proxy_user |
   +-------------------+---------------------+--------------+
   | antonio@localhost | developer@localhost | ''@''        |
   +-------------------+---------------------+--------------+
   ```

   This demonstrates that the `antonio`
   operating system user is authenticated to have the
   privileges granted to the `developer`
   MySQL user, and that proxying occurs through the default
   proxy account.

   If `antonio` is not a member of the
   `root` PAM group but is a member of the
   `users` PAM group, a similar process
   occurs, but the plugin maps `user` PAM
   group membership to the `data_entry`
   MySQL user name and returns that name to the server:

   ```sql
   mysql> SELECT USER(), CURRENT_USER(), @@proxy_user;
   +-------------------+----------------------+--------------+
   | USER()            | CURRENT_USER()       | @@proxy_user |
   +-------------------+----------------------+--------------+
   | antonio@localhost | data_entry@localhost | ''@''        |
   +-------------------+----------------------+--------------+
   ```

   This demonstrates that the `antonio`
   operating system user is authenticated to have the
   privileges of the `data_entry` MySQL
   user, and that proxying occurs through the default proxy
   account.

Note

The client-side `mysql_clear_password`
authentication plugin leaves the password untouched, so
client programs send it to the MySQL server as cleartext.
This enables the password to be passed as is to PAM. A
cleartext password is necessary to use the server-side PAM
library, but may be a security problem in some
configurations. These measures minimize the risk:

- To make inadvertent use of the
  `mysql_clear_password` plugin less
  likely, MySQL clients must explicitly enable it (for
  example, with the
  `--enable-cleartext-plugin` option). See
  [Section 8.4.1.4, “Client-Side Cleartext Pluggable Authentication”](cleartext-pluggable-authentication.md "8.4.1.4 Client-Side Cleartext Pluggable Authentication").
- To avoid password exposure with the
  `mysql_clear_password` plugin enabled,
  MySQL clients should connect to the MySQL server using
  an encrypted connection. See
  [Section 8.3.1, “Configuring MySQL to Use Encrypted Connections”](using-encrypted-connections.md "8.3.1 Configuring MySQL to Use Encrypted Connections").

##### PAM Authentication Access to Unix Password Store

On some systems, Unix authentication uses a password store
such as `/etc/shadow`, a file that
typically has restricted access permissions. This can cause
MySQL PAM-based authentication to fail. Unfortunately, the PAM
implementation does not permit distinguishing “password
could not be checked” (due, for example, to inability
to read `/etc/shadow`) from “password
does not match.” If you are using Unix password store
for PAM authentication, you may be able to enable access to it
from MySQL using one of the following methods:

- Assuming that the MySQL server is run from the
  `mysql` operating system account, put
  that account in the `shadow` group that
  has `/etc/shadow` access:

  1. Create a `shadow` group in
     `/etc/group`.
  2. Add the `mysql` operating system user
     to the `shadow` group in
     `/etc/group`.
  3. Assign `/etc/group` to the
     `shadow` group and enable the group
     read permission:

     ```terminal
     chgrp shadow /etc/shadow
     chmod g+r /etc/shadow
     ```
  4. Restart the MySQL server.
- If you are using the `pam_unix` module
  and the **unix\_chkpwd** utility, enable
  password store access as follows:

  ```terminal
  chmod u-s /usr/sbin/unix_chkpwd
  setcap cap_dac_read_search+ep /usr/sbin/unix_chkpwd
  ```

  Adjust the path to **unix\_chkpwd** as
  necessary for your platform.

##### PAM Authentication Debugging

The PAM authentication plugin checks at initialization time
whether the `AUTHENTICATION_PAM_LOG`
environment value is set. In MySQL 8.0.35 and earlier, the
value does not matter. If so, the plugin enables logging of
diagnostic messages to the standard output. These messages may
be helpful for debugging PAM-related issues that occur when
the plugin performs authentication. You should be aware that,
in these versions, passwords are included in these messages.

Beginning with MySQL 8.0.36, setting
`AUTHENTICATION_PAM_LOG=1` (or some other
arbitrary value) produces the same diagnostic messages, but
does *not* include any passwords. If you
wish to include passwords in these messages, set
`AUTHENTICATION_PAM_LOG=PAM_LOG_WITH_SECRET_INFO`.

Some messages include reference to PAM plugin source files and
line numbers, which enables plugin actions to be tied more
closely to the location in the code where they occur.

Another technique for debugging connection failures and
determining what is happening during connection attempts is to
configure PAM authentication to permit all connections, then
check the system log files. This technique should be used only
on a *temporary* basis, and not on a
production server.

Configure a PAM service file named
`/etc/pam.d/mysql-any-password` with these
contents (the format may differ on some systems):

```none
#%PAM-1.0
auth        required    pam_permit.so
account     required    pam_permit.so
```

Create an account that uses the PAM plugin and names the
`mysql-any-password` PAM service:

```sql
CREATE USER 'testuser'@'localhost'
  IDENTIFIED WITH authentication_pam
  AS 'mysql-any-password';
```

The `mysql-any-password` service file causes
any authentication attempt to return true, even for incorrect
passwords. If an authentication attempt fails, that tells you
the configuration problem is on the MySQL side. Otherwise, the
problem is on the operating system/PAM side. To see what might
be happening, check system log files such as
`/var/log/secure`,
`/var/log/audit.log`,
`/var/log/syslog`, or
`/var/log/messages`.

After determining what the problem is, remove the
`mysql-any-password` PAM service file to
disable any-password access.
