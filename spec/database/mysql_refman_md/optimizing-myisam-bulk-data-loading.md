### 10.6.2 Bulk Data Loading for MyISAM Tables

These performance tips supplement the general guidelines for
fast inserts in [Section 10.2.5.1, “Optimizing INSERT Statements”](insert-optimization.md "10.2.5.1 Optimizing INSERT Statements").

- For a `MyISAM` table, you can use
  concurrent inserts to add rows at the same time that
  [`SELECT`](select.md "15.2.13 SELECT Statement") statements are
  running, if there are no deleted rows in middle of the data
  file. See [Section 10.11.3, “Concurrent Inserts”](concurrent-inserts.md "10.11.3 Concurrent Inserts").
- With some extra work, it is possible to make
  [`LOAD DATA`](load-data.md "15.2.9 LOAD DATA Statement") run even faster for
  a `MyISAM` table when the table has many
  indexes. Use the following procedure:

  1. Execute a [`FLUSH TABLES`](flush.md#flush-tables)
     statement or a [**mysqladmin
     flush-tables**](mysqladmin.md "6.5.2 mysqladmin — A MySQL Server Administration Program") command.
  2. Use [**myisamchk --keys-used=0 -rq
     *`/path/to/db/tbl_name`***](myisamchk.md "6.6.4 myisamchk — MyISAM Table-Maintenance Utility")
     to remove all use of indexes for the table.
  3. Insert data into the table with
     [`LOAD DATA`](load-data.md "15.2.9 LOAD DATA Statement"). This does not
     update any indexes and therefore is very fast.
  4. If you intend only to read from the table in the future,
     use [**myisampack**](myisampack.md "6.6.6 myisampack — Generate Compressed, Read-Only MyISAM Tables") to compress it. See
     [Section 18.2.3.3, “Compressed Table Characteristics”](compressed-format.md "18.2.3.3 Compressed Table Characteristics").
  5. Re-create the indexes with [**myisamchk -rq
     *`/path/to/db/tbl_name`***](myisamchk.md "6.6.4 myisamchk — MyISAM Table-Maintenance Utility").
     This creates the index tree in memory before writing it
     to disk, which is much faster than updating the index
     during [`LOAD DATA`](load-data.md "15.2.9 LOAD DATA Statement") because
     it avoids lots of disk seeks. The resulting index tree
     is also perfectly balanced.
  6. Execute a [`FLUSH TABLES`](flush.md#flush-tables)
     statement or a [**mysqladmin
     flush-tables**](mysqladmin.md "6.5.2 mysqladmin — A MySQL Server Administration Program") command.

  [`LOAD DATA`](load-data.md "15.2.9 LOAD DATA Statement") performs the
  preceding optimization automatically if the
  `MyISAM` table into which you insert data
  is empty. The main difference between automatic optimization
  and using the procedure explicitly is that you can let
  [**myisamchk**](myisamchk.md "6.6.4 myisamchk — MyISAM Table-Maintenance Utility") allocate much more temporary
  memory for the index creation than you might want the server
  to allocate for index re-creation when it executes the
  [`LOAD DATA`](load-data.md "15.2.9 LOAD DATA Statement") statement.

  You can also disable or enable the nonunique indexes for a
  `MyISAM` table by using the following
  statements rather than [**myisamchk**](myisamchk.md "6.6.4 myisamchk — MyISAM Table-Maintenance Utility"). If you
  use these statements, you can skip the
  [`FLUSH TABLES`](flush.md#flush-tables) operations:

  ```sql
  ALTER TABLE tbl_name DISABLE KEYS;
  ALTER TABLE tbl_name ENABLE KEYS;
  ```
- To speed up [`INSERT`](insert.md "15.2.7 INSERT Statement") operations
  that are performed with multiple statements for
  nontransactional tables, lock your tables:

  ```sql
  LOCK TABLES a WRITE;
  INSERT INTO a VALUES (1,23),(2,34),(4,33);
  INSERT INTO a VALUES (8,26),(6,29);
  ...
  UNLOCK TABLES;
  ```

  This benefits performance because the index buffer is
  flushed to disk only once, after all
  [`INSERT`](insert.md "15.2.7 INSERT Statement") statements have
  completed. Normally, there would be as many index buffer
  flushes as there are [`INSERT`](insert.md "15.2.7 INSERT Statement")
  statements. Explicit locking statements are not needed if
  you can insert all rows with a single
  [`INSERT`](insert.md "15.2.7 INSERT Statement").

  Locking also lowers the total time for multiple-connection
  tests, although the maximum wait time for individual
  connections might go up because they wait for locks. Suppose
  that five clients attempt to perform inserts simultaneously
  as follows:

  - Connection 1 does 1000 inserts
  - Connections 2, 3, and 4 do 1 insert
  - Connection 5 does 1000 inserts

  If you do not use locking, connections 2, 3, and 4 finish
  before 1 and 5. If you use locking, connections 2, 3, and 4
  probably do not finish before 1 or 5, but the total time
  should be about 40% faster.

  [`INSERT`](insert.md "15.2.7 INSERT Statement"),
  [`UPDATE`](update.md "15.2.17 UPDATE Statement"), and
  [`DELETE`](delete.md "15.2.2 DELETE Statement") operations are very
  fast in MySQL, but you can obtain better overall performance
  by adding locks around everything that does more than about
  five successive inserts or updates. If you do very many
  successive inserts, you could do a [`LOCK
  TABLES`](lock-tables.md "15.3.6 LOCK TABLES and UNLOCK TABLES Statements") followed by an
  [`UNLOCK
  TABLES`](lock-tables.md "15.3.6 LOCK TABLES and UNLOCK TABLES Statements") once in a while (each 1,000 rows or so) to
  permit other threads to access table. This would still
  result in a nice performance gain.

  [`INSERT`](insert.md "15.2.7 INSERT Statement") is still much slower
  for loading data than [`LOAD
  DATA`](load-data.md "15.2.9 LOAD DATA Statement"), even when using the strategies just
  outlined.
- To increase performance for `MyISAM`
  tables, for both [`LOAD DATA`](load-data.md "15.2.9 LOAD DATA Statement")
  and [`INSERT`](insert.md "15.2.7 INSERT Statement"), enlarge the key
  cache by increasing the
  [`key_buffer_size`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_key_buffer_size) system
  variable. See [Section 7.1.1, “Configuring the Server”](server-configuration.md "7.1.1 Configuring the Server").
