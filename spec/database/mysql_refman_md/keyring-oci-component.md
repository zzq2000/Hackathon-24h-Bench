#### 8.4.4.11 Using the Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Vault Keyring Component

Note

The Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Vault keyring component is included in MySQL Enterprise Edition, a
commercial product. To learn more about commercial products,
see <https://www.mysql.com/products/>.

`component_keyring_oci` is part of the
component infrastructure that communicates with Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Vault for
back end storage. No key information is permanently stored in
MySQL server local storage. All keys are stored in Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Vault,
making this component well suited for Oracle Cloud Infrastructure MySQL customers for
management of their MySQL Enterprise Edition keys.

In MySQL 8.0.24, MySQL Keyring began transitioning from plugins
to use the component infrastructure. The introduction of
`component_keyring_oci` in MySQL 8.0.31 is a
continuation of that effort. For more information, see
[Keyring
Components Versus Keyring Plugins](keyring-component-plugin-comparison.md "8.4.4.1 Keyring Components Versus Keyring Plugins").

Note

Only one keyring component or plugin should be enabled at a
time. Enabling multiple keyring components or plugins is
unsupported and results may not be as anticipated.

To use `component_keyring_oci` for keystore
management, you must:

1. Write a manifest that tells the server to load
   `component_keyring_oci`, as described in
   [Section 8.4.4.2, “Keyring Component Installation”](keyring-component-installation.md "8.4.4.2 Keyring Component Installation").
2. Write a configuration file for
   `component_keyring_oci`, as described here.

After writing a manifest and configuration file, you should be
able to access keys that were created using the
`keyring_oci` plugin, provided that you specify
the same set of configuration options to initialize the keyring
component. The built-in backward compatibility of
`component_keyring_oci` simplifies migrating
from the keyring plugin to the component.

- [Vault Keyring Component Usage](keyring-oci-component.md#keyring-oci-component-usage "Vault Keyring Component Usage")

##### Configuration Notes

When it initializes, `component_keyring_oci`
reads either a global configuration file, or a global
configuration file paired with a local configuration file:

- The component attempts to read its global configuration
  file from the directory where the component library file
  is installed (that is, the server plugin directory).
- If the global configuration file indicates use of a local
  configuration file, the component attempts to read its
  local configuration file from the data directory.
- Although global and local configuration files are located
  in different directories, the file name is
  `component_keyring_oci.cnf` in both
  locations.
- It is an error for no configuration file to exist.
  `component_keyring_oci` cannot initialize
  without a valid configuration.

Local configuration files permit setting up multiple server
instances to use `component_keyring_oci`,
such that component configuration for each server instance is
specific to a given data directory instance. This enables the
same keyring component to be used with a distinct Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Vault
for each instance.

You are assumed to be familiar with Oracle Cloud Infrastructure concepts, but the
following documentation may be helpful when setting up
resources to be used by
`component_keyring_oci`:

- [Overview
  of Vault](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/KeyManagement/Concepts/keyoverview.htm)
- [Required
  Keys and OCIDs](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/API/Concepts/apisigningkey.htm)
- [Managing
  Keys](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/KeyManagement/Tasks/managingkeys.htm)
- [Managing
  Compartments](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/Identity/Tasks/managingcompartments.htm)
- [Managing
  Vaults](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/KeyManagement/Tasks/managingvaults.htm)
- [Managing
  Secrets](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/KeyManagement/Tasks/managingsecrets.htm)

`component_keyring_oci` configuration files
have these properties:

- A configuration file must be in valid JSON format.
- A configuration file must have the appropriate file
  permission that allows MySQL to read it. Since the file
  contains sensitive information, it should be set to world
  readable.
- A configuration file permits these configuration items:

  - `"read_local_config"`: This item is
    permitted only in the global configuration file. If
    the item is not present, the component uses only the
    global configuration file. If the item is present, its
    value is `true` or
    `false`, indicating whether the
    component should read configuration information from
    the local configuration file.

    If the `"read_local_config"` item is
    present in the global configuration file along with
    other items, the component checks the
    `"read_local_config"` item value
    first:

    - If the value is `false`, the
      component processes the other items in the global
      configuration file and ignores the local
      configuration file.
    - If the value is `true`, the
      component ignores the other items in the global
      configuration file and attempts to read the local
      configuration file.
  - `“user”`: The OCID of the Oracle Cloud Infrastructure
    user that `component_keyring_oci`
    uses for connections. Prior to using
    `component_keyring_oci`, the user
    account must exist and be granted access to use the
    configured Oracle Cloud Infrastructure tenancy, compartment, and vault
    resources. To obtain the user OCID from the Console,
    use the instructions at
    [Required
    Keys and OCIDs](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/API/Concepts/apisigningkey.htm).

    This value is mandatory.
  - `“tenancy”`: The OCID of the
    Oracle Cloud Infrastructure tenancy that
    `component_keyring_oci` uses as the
    location of the MySQL compartment. Prior to using
    `component_keyring_oci`, you must
    create a tenancy if it does not exist. To obtain the
    tenancy OCID from the Console, use the instructions at
    [Required
    Keys and OCIDs](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/API/Concepts/apisigningkey.htm).

    This value is mandatory.
  - `“compartment”`: The OCID of the
    tenancy compartment that
    `component_keyring_oci` uses as the
    location of the MySQL keys. Prior to using
    `component_keyring_oci`, you must
    create a MySQL compartment or subcompartment if it
    does not exist. This compartment should contain no
    vault keys or vault secrets. It should not be used by
    systems other than MySQL Keyring. For information
    about managing compartments and obtaining the OCID,
    see
    [Managing
    Compartments](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/Identity/Tasks/managingcompartments.htm).

    This value is mandatory.
  - `“virtual_vault”`: The OCID of
    the Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Vault that
    `component_keyring_oci` uses for
    encryption operations. Prior to using
    `component_keyring_oci`, you must
    create a new vault in the MySQL compartment if it does
    not exist. (Alternatively, you can reuse an existing
    vault that is in a parent compartment of the MySQL
    compartment.) Compartment users can see and use only
    the keys in their respective compartments. For
    information about creating a vault and obtaining the
    vault OCID, see
    [Managing
    Vaults](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/KeyManagement/Tasks/managingvaults.htm).

    This value is mandatory.
  - `“encryption_endpoint”`: The
    endpoint of the Oracle Cloud Infrastructure encryption server that
    `component_keyring_oci` uses for
    generating encrypted or encoded information
    (ciphertext) for new keys. The encryption endpoint is
    vault specific and Oracle Cloud Infrastructure assigns it at vault-creation
    time. To obtain the endpoint OCID, view the
    configuration details for your keyring\_oci vault,
    using the instructions at
    [Managing
    Vaults](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/KeyManagement/Tasks/managingvaults.htm).

    This value is mandatory.
  - `"management_endpoint"`: The endpoint
    of the Oracle Cloud Infrastructure key management server that
    `component_keyring_oci` uses for
    listing existing keys. The key management endpoint is
    vault specific and Oracle Cloud Infrastructure assigns it at vault-creation
    time. To obtain the endpoint OCID, view the
    configuration details for your keyring\_oci vault,
    using the instructions at
    [Managing
    Vaults](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/KeyManagement/Tasks/managingvaults.htm).

    This value is mandatory.
  - `“vaults_endpoint”`: The endpoint
    of the Oracle Cloud Infrastructure vaults server that
    `component_keyring_oci` uses for
    obtaining the value of secrets. The vaults endpoint is
    vault specific and Oracle Cloud Infrastructure assigns it at vault-creation
    time. To obtain the endpoint OCID, view the
    configuration details for your keyring\_oci vault,
    using the instructions at
    [Managing
    Vaults](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/KeyManagement/Tasks/managingvaults.htm).

    This value is mandatory.
  - `“secrets_endpoint”`: The
    endpoint of the Oracle Cloud Infrastructure secrets server that
    `component_keyring_oci` uses for
    listing, creating, and retiring secrets. The secrets
    endpoint is vault specific and Oracle Cloud Infrastructure assigns it at
    vault-creation time. To obtain the endpoint OCID, view
    the configuration details for your keyring\_oci vault,
    using the instructions at
    [Managing
    Vaults](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/KeyManagement/Tasks/managingvaults.htm).

    This value is mandatory.
  - `“master_key”`: The OCID of the
    Oracle Cloud Infrastructure master encryption key that
    `component_keyring_oci` uses for
    encryption of secrets. Prior to using
    `component_keyring_oci`, you must
    create a cryptographic key for the Oracle Cloud Infrastructure compartment
    if it does not exist. Provide a MySQL-specific name
    for the generated key and do not use it for other
    purposes. For information about key creation, see
    [Managing
    Keys](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/KeyManagement/Tasks/managingkeys.htm).

    This value is mandatory.
  - `“key_file”`: The path name of
    the file containing the RSA private key that
    `component_keyring_oci` uses for
    Oracle Cloud Infrastructure authentication. You must also upload the
    corresponding RSA public key using the Console. The
    Console displays the key fingerprint value, which you
    can use to set the
    `"key_fingerprint"` value. For
    information about generating and uploading API keys,
    see
    [Required
    Keys and OCIDs](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/API/Concepts/apisigningkey.htm).

    This value is mandatory.
  - `“key_fingerprint”`: The
    fingerprint of the RSA private key that
    `component_keyring_oci` uses for
    Oracle Cloud Infrastructure authentication. To obtain the key fingerprint
    while creating the API keys, execute this command:

    ```terminal
    openssl rsa -pubout -outform DER -in ~/.oci/oci_api_key.pem | openssl md5 -c
    ```

    Alternatively, obtain the fingerprint from the
    Console, which automatically displays the fingerprint
    when you upload the RSA public key. For information
    about obtaining key fingerprints, see
    [Required
    Keys and OCIDs](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/API/Concepts/apisigningkey.htm).

    This value is mandatory.
  - `“ca_certificate”`: The path name
    of the CA certificate bundle file that
    `component_keyring_oci` component
    uses for Oracle Cloud Infrastructure certificate verification. The file
    contains one or more certificates for peer
    verification. If no file is specified, the default CA
    bundle installed on the system is used. If the value
    is set to `disabled`
    (case-sensitive),
    `component_keyring_oci` performs no
    certificate verification.

    On Windows systems, this should be set to
    `disabled`, or to the path to a CA
    certificate bundle file.

Given the preceding configuration file properties, to
configure `component_keyring_oci`, create a
global configuration file named
`component_keyring_oci.cnf` in the
directory where the `component_keyring_oci`
library file is installed, and optionally create a local
configuration file, also named
`component_keyring_oci.cnf`, in the data
directory.

##### Verify the Component Installation

After performing any component-specific configuration, start
the server. Verify component installation by examining the
Performance Schema
[`keyring_component_status`](performance-schema-keyring-component-status-table.md "29.12.18.1 The keyring_component_status Table") table:

+---------------------+--------------------------------------------------------------------+
```

A `Component_status` value of
`Active` indicates that the component
initialized successfully.

If the component cannot be loaded, server startup fails. Check
the server error log for diagnostic messages. If the component
loads but fails to initialize due to configuration problems,
the server starts but the `Component_status`
value is `Disabled`. Check the server error
log, correct the configuration issues, and use the
[`ALTER INSTANCE RELOAD KEYRING`](alter-instance.md#alter-instance-reload-keyring)
statement to reload the configuration.

It is possible to query MySQL server for the list of existing
keys. To see which keys exist, examine the Performance Schema
[`keyring_keys`](performance-schema-keyring-keys-table.md "29.12.18.2 The keyring_keys table") table.

```sql
mysql> SELECT * FROM performance_schema.keyring_keys;
+-----------------------------+--------------+----------------+
| KEY_ID                      | KEY_OWNER    | BACKEND_KEY_ID |
+-----------------------------+--------------+----------------+
| audit_log-20210322T130749-1 |              |                |

| YourKey                     | me@localhost |                |
+-----------------------------+--------------+----------------+
```

##### Vault Keyring Component Usage

`component_keyring_oci` supports the
functions that comprise the standard MySQL Keyring service
interface. Keyring operations performed by those functions are
accessible in SQL statements as described in
[Section 8.4.4.15, “General-Purpose Keyring Key-Management Functions”](keyring-functions-general-purpose.md "8.4.4.15 General-Purpose Keyring Key-Management Functions").

Example:

```sql
SELECT keyring_key_generate('MyKey', 'AES', 32);
SELECT keyring_key_remove('MyKey');
```

For information about the characteristics of key values
permitted by `component_keyring_oci`, see
[Section 8.4.4.13, “Supported Keyring Key Types and Lengths”](keyring-key-types.md "8.4.4.13 Supported Keyring Key Types and Lengths").
