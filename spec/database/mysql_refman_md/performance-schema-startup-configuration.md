## 29.3 Performance Schema Startup Configuration

To use the MySQL Performance Schema, it must be enabled at server
startup to enable event collection to occur.

The Performance Schema is enabled by default. To enable or disable
it explicitly, start the server with the
[`performance_schema`](performance-schema-system-variables.md#sysvar_performance_schema) variable set
to an appropriate value. For example, use these lines in the
server `my.cnf` file:

```ini
[mysqld]
performance_schema=ON
```

If the server is unable to allocate any internal buffer during
Performance Schema initialization, the Performance Schema disables
itself and sets
[`performance_schema`](performance-schema-system-variables.md#sysvar_performance_schema) to
`OFF`, and the server runs without
instrumentation.

The Performance Schema also permits instrument and consumer
configuration at server startup.

To control an instrument at server startup, use an option of this
form:

```terminal
--performance-schema-instrument='instrument_name=value'
```

Here, *`instrument_name`* is an instrument
name such as `wait/synch/mutex/sql/LOCK_open`,
and *`value`* is one of these values:

- `OFF`, `FALSE`, or
  `0`: Disable the instrument
- `ON`, `TRUE`, or
  `1`: Enable and time the instrument
- `COUNTED`: Enable and count (rather than
  time) the instrument

Each
[`--performance-schema-instrument`](performance-schema-options.md#option_mysqld_performance-schema-instrument)
option can specify only one instrument name, but multiple
instances of the option can be given to configure multiple
instruments. In addition, patterns are permitted in instrument
names to configure instruments that match the pattern. To
configure all condition synchronization instruments as enabled and
counted, use this option:

```terminal
--performance-schema-instrument='wait/synch/cond/%=COUNTED'
```

To disable all instruments, use this option:

```terminal
--performance-schema-instrument='%=OFF'
```

Exception: The `memory/performance_schema/%`
instruments are built in and cannot be disabled at startup.

Longer instrument name strings take precedence over shorter
pattern names, regardless of order. For information about
specifying patterns to select instruments, see
[Section 29.4.9, “Naming Instruments or Consumers for Filtering Operations”](performance-schema-filtering-names.md "29.4.9 Naming Instruments or Consumers for Filtering Operations").

An unrecognized instrument name is ignored. It is possible that a
plugin installed later may create the instrument, at which time
the name is recognized and configured.

To control a consumer at server startup, use an option of this
form:

```terminal
--performance-schema-consumer-consumer_name=value
```

Here, *`consumer_name`* is a consumer name
such as `events_waits_history`, and
*`value`* is one of these values:

- `OFF`, `FALSE`, or
  `0`: Do not collect events for the consumer
- `ON`, `TRUE`, or
  `1`: Collect events for the consumer

For example, to enable the `events_waits_history`
consumer, use this option:

```terminal
--performance-schema-consumer-events-waits-history=ON
```

The permitted consumer names can be found by examining the
[`setup_consumers`](performance-schema-setup-consumers-table.md "29.12.2.2 The setup_consumers Table") table. Patterns are
not permitted. Consumer names in the
[`setup_consumers`](performance-schema-setup-consumers-table.md "29.12.2.2 The setup_consumers Table") table use
underscores, but for consumers set at startup, dashes and
underscores within the name are equivalent.

The Performance Schema includes several system variables that
provide configuration information:

```sql
mysql> SHOW VARIABLES LIKE 'perf%';
+--------------------------------------------------------+---------+
| Variable_name                                          | Value   |
+--------------------------------------------------------+---------+
| performance_schema                                     | ON      |
| performance_schema_accounts_size                       | 100     |
| performance_schema_digests_size                        | 200     |
| performance_schema_events_stages_history_long_size     | 10000   |
| performance_schema_events_stages_history_size          | 10      |
| performance_schema_events_statements_history_long_size | 10000   |
| performance_schema_events_statements_history_size      | 10      |
| performance_schema_events_waits_history_long_size      | 10000   |
| performance_schema_events_waits_history_size           | 10      |
| performance_schema_hosts_size                          | 100     |
| performance_schema_max_cond_classes                    | 80      |
| performance_schema_max_cond_instances                  | 1000    |
...
```

The [`performance_schema`](performance-schema-system-variables.md#sysvar_performance_schema) variable
is `ON` or `OFF` to indicate
whether the Performance Schema is enabled or disabled. The other
variables indicate table sizes (number of rows) or memory
allocation values.

Note

With the Performance Schema enabled, the number of Performance
Schema instances affects the server memory footprint, perhaps to
a large extent. The Performance Schema autoscales many
parameters to use memory only as required; see
[Section 29.17, “The Performance Schema Memory-Allocation Model”](performance-schema-memory-model.md "29.17 The Performance Schema Memory-Allocation Model").

To change the value of Performance Schema system variables, set
them at server startup. For example, put the following lines in a
`my.cnf` file to change the sizes of the
history tables for wait events:

```ini
[mysqld]
performance_schema
performance_schema_events_waits_history_size=20
performance_schema_events_waits_history_long_size=15000
```

The Performance Schema automatically sizes the values of several
of its parameters at server startup if they are not set
explicitly. For example, it sizes the parameters that control the
sizes of the events waits tables this way. The Performance Schema
allocates memory incrementally, scaling its memory use to actual
server load, instead of allocating all the memory it needs during
server startup. Consequently, many sizing parameters need not be
set at all. To see which parameters are autosized or autoscaled,
use [**mysqld --verbose --help**](mysqld.md "6.3.1 mysqld — The MySQL Server") and examine the
option descriptions, or see
[Section 29.15, “Performance Schema System Variables”](performance-schema-system-variables.md "29.15 Performance Schema System Variables").

For each autosized parameter that is not set at server startup,
the Performance Schema determines how to set its value based on
the value of the following system values, which are considered as
“hints” about how you have configured your MySQL
server:

```none
max_connections
open_files_limit
table_definition_cache
table_open_cache
```

To override autosizing or autoscaling for a given parameter, set
it to a value other than −1 at startup. In this case, the
Performance Schema assigns it the specified value.

At runtime, [`SHOW VARIABLES`](show-variables.md "15.7.7.41 SHOW VARIABLES Statement") displays
the actual values that autosized parameters were set to.
Autoscaled parameters display with a value of −1.

If the Performance Schema is disabled, its autosized and
autoscaled parameters remain set to −1 and
[`SHOW VARIABLES`](show-variables.md "15.7.7.41 SHOW VARIABLES Statement") displays −1.
