#### 15.7.8.2 CACHE INDEX Statement

```sql
CACHE INDEX {
      tbl_index_list [, tbl_index_list] ...
    | tbl_name PARTITION (partition_list)
  }
  IN key_cache_name

tbl_index_list:
  tbl_name [{INDEX|KEY} (index_name[, index_name] ...)]

partition_list: {
    partition_name[, partition_name] ...
  | ALL
}
```

The [`CACHE INDEX`](cache-index.md "15.7.8.2 CACHE INDEX Statement") statement assigns
table indexes to a specific key cache. It applies only to
`MyISAM` tables, including partitioned
`MyISAM` tables. After the indexes have been
assigned, they can be preloaded into the cache if desired with
[`LOAD INDEX INTO
CACHE`](load-index.md "15.7.8.5 LOAD INDEX INTO CACHE Statement").

The following statement assigns indexes from the tables
`t1`, `t2`, and
`t3` to the key cache named
`hot_cache`:

```sql
mysql> CACHE INDEX t1, t2, t3 IN hot_cache;
+---------+--------------------+----------+----------+
| Table   | Op                 | Msg_type | Msg_text |
+---------+--------------------+----------+----------+
| test.t1 | assign_to_keycache | status   | OK       |
| test.t2 | assign_to_keycache | status   | OK       |
| test.t3 | assign_to_keycache | status   | OK       |
+---------+--------------------+----------+----------+
```

The syntax of [`CACHE INDEX`](cache-index.md "15.7.8.2 CACHE INDEX Statement") enables
you to specify that only particular indexes from a table should
be assigned to the cache. However, the implementation assigns
all the table's indexes to the cache, so there is no reason to
specify anything other than the table name.

The key cache referred to in a [`CACHE
INDEX`](cache-index.md "15.7.8.2 CACHE INDEX Statement") statement can be created by setting its size
with a parameter setting statement or in the server parameter
settings. For example:

```sql
SET GLOBAL keycache1.key_buffer_size=128*1024;
```

Key cache parameters are accessed as members of a structured
system variable. See
[Section 7.1.9.5, “Structured System Variables”](structured-system-variables.md "7.1.9.5 Structured System Variables").

A key cache must exist before you assign indexes to it, or an
error occurs:

```sql
mysql> CACHE INDEX t1 IN non_existent_cache;
ERROR 1284 (HY000): Unknown key cache 'non_existent_cache'
```

By default, table indexes are assigned to the main (default) key
cache created at the server startup. When a key cache is
destroyed, all indexes assigned to it are reassigned to the
default key cache.

Index assignment affects the server globally: If one client
assigns an index to a given cache, this cache is used for all
queries involving the index, no matter which client issues the
queries.

[`CACHE INDEX`](cache-index.md "15.7.8.2 CACHE INDEX Statement") is supported for
partitioned `MyISAM` tables. You can assign one
or more indexes for one, several, or all partitions to a given
key cache. For example, you can do the following:

```sql
CREATE TABLE pt (c1 INT, c2 VARCHAR(50), INDEX i(c1))
    ENGINE=MyISAM
    PARTITION BY HASH(c1)
    PARTITIONS 4;

SET GLOBAL kc_fast.key_buffer_size = 128 * 1024;
SET GLOBAL kc_slow.key_buffer_size = 128 * 1024;

CACHE INDEX pt PARTITION (p0) IN kc_fast;
CACHE INDEX pt PARTITION (p1, p3) IN kc_slow;
```

The previous set of statements performs the following actions:

- Creates a partitioned table with 4 partitions; these
  partitions are automatically named `p0`,
  ..., `p3`; this table has an index named
  `i` on column `c1`.
- Creates 2 key caches named `kc_fast` and
  `kc_slow`
- Assigns the index for partition `p0` to the
  `kc_fast` key cache and the index for
  partitions `p1` and `p3`
  to the `kc_slow` key cache; the index for
  the remaining partition (`p2`) uses the
  server's default key cache.

If you wish instead to assign the indexes for all partitions in
table `pt` to a single key cache named
`kc_all`, you can use either of the following
two statements:

```sql
CACHE INDEX pt PARTITION (ALL) IN kc_all;

CACHE INDEX pt IN kc_all;
```

The two statements just shown are equivalent, and issuing either
one has exactly the same effect. In other words, if you wish to
assign indexes for all partitions of a partitioned table to the
same key cache, the `PARTITION (ALL)` clause is
optional.

When assigning indexes for multiple partitions to a key cache,
the partitions need not be contiguous, and you need not list
their names in any particular order. Indexes for any partitions
not explicitly assigned to a key cache automatically use the
server default key cache.

Index preloading is also supported for partitioned
`MyISAM` tables. For more information, see
[Section 15.7.8.5, “LOAD INDEX INTO CACHE Statement”](load-index.md "15.7.8.5 LOAD INDEX INTO CACHE Statement").
