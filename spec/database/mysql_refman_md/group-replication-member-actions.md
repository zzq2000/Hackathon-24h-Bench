#### 20.5.1.5 Configuring Member Actions

From MySQL 8.0.26, Group Replication has the capability to set
actions for the members of a group to take in specified
situations. Member actions can be enabled and disabled
individually using functions. The member actions configuration
for a server can also be reset to the default after it has left
the group.

Administrators (with the
[`GROUP_REPLICATION_ADMIN`](privileges-provided.md#priv_group-replication-admin)
privilege) can configure a member action on the group’s
primary using the
[`group_replication_enable_member_action`](group-replication-functions-for-member-actions.md#function_group-replication-enable-member-action)
or
[`group_replication_disable_member_action`](group-replication-functions-for-member-actions.md#function_group-replication-disable-member-action)
function. The member actions configuration, consisting of all
the member actions and whether they are enabled or disabled, is
then propagated to other group members and joining members using
Group Replication’s group messages. All group members
therefore have the same member actions configuration. You can
also configure member actions on a server that is not part of a
group, as long as the Group Replication plugin is installed. In
that case, the member actions configuration is not propagated to
any other servers.

If the server where you use the functions to configure a member
action is part of a group, it must be the current primary in a
group in single-primary mode, and it must be part of the
majority. The configuration change is tracked internally by
Group Replication, but it is not given a GTID and is not written
to the binary log, so it is not propagated to any servers
outside the group, such as downstream replicas. Group
Replication increments the version number for its member actions
configuration each time a member action is enabled or disabled.

The member actions configuration is propagated to members as
follows:

- When starting a group, the member actions configuration of
  the server that bootstraps the group becomes the
  configuration for the group.
- If a group’s lowest MySQL Server version supports member
  actions, joining members receive the group’s member
  actions configuration during the state exchange process that
  takes place when they join. In that case, the joining member
  replaces its own member actions configuration with the
  group’s.
- If a joining member that supports member actions joins a
  group where the lowest MySQL Server version does not support
  member actions, it does not receive a member actions
  configuration when it joins. In that case, the joining
  member resets its own configuration to the default.

A member that does not support member actions cannot join a
group that has a member actions configuration, because its MySQL
Server version is lower than the lowest version that the
existing group members are running.

The Performance Schema table
[`replication_group_member_actions`](performance-schema-replication-group-member-actions-table.md "29.12.11.14 The replication_group_member_actions Table")
lists the member actions that are available in the
configuration, the events that trigger them, and whether or not
they are currently enabled. Member actions have a priority from
1 to 100, with lower values being actioned first. If an error
occurs when the member action is being carried out, the failure
of the member action can be logged but otherwise ignored. If the
failure of the member action is considered critical, it can be
handled according to the policy specified by the
[`group_replication_exit_state_action`](group-replication-system-variables.md#sysvar_group_replication_exit_state_action)
system variable.

The
`mysql.replication_group_configuration_version`
table, which can be viewed using the Performance Schema table
[`replication_group_configuration_version`](performance-schema-replication-group-configuration-version-table.md "29.12.11.13 The replication_group_configuration_version Table"),
records the current version of the member actions configuration.
Whenever a member action is enabled or disabled using the
functions, the version number is incremented.

The
[`group_replication_reset_member_actions`](group-replication-functions-for-member-actions.md#function_group-replication-reset-member-actions)
function can only be used on a server that is not part of a
group. It resets the member actions configuration to the default
settings, and resets its version number to 1. The server must be
writeable (with the [`read_only`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_read_only)
system variable set to `OFF`) and have the
Group Replication plugin installed. You can use this function to
remove the member actions configuration that a server used when
it was part of a group, if you intend to use it as a standalone
server with no member actions or different member actions.

##### Member action: `mysql_disable_super_read_only_if_primary`

The member action
`mysql_disable_super_read_only_if_primary`
can be configured to make a group in single-primary mode stay
in super read-only mode when a new primary is elected, so that
the group only accepts replicated transactions and does not
accept any direct writes from clients. This setup means that
when a group’s purpose is to provide a secondary backup to
another group for disaster tolerance, you can ensure that the
secondary group remains synchronized with the first.

By default, super read-only mode is disabled on the primary
when it is elected, so that the primary becomes read-write,
and accepts updates from a replication source server and from
clients. This is the situation when the member action
`mysql_disable_super_read_only_if_primary` is
enabled, which is its default setting. If you set the action
to disabled using the
[`group_replication_disable_member_action`](group-replication-functions-for-member-actions.md#function_group-replication-disable-member-action)
function, the primary remains in super read-only mode after
election. In this state, it does not accept updates from any
clients, even users who have the
[`CONNECTION_ADMIN`](privileges-provided.md#priv_connection-admin) or
[`SUPER`](privileges-provided.md#priv_super) privilege. It does
continue to accept updates performed by replication threads.
