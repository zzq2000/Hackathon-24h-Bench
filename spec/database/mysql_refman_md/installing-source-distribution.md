### 2.8.4 Installing MySQL Using a Standard Source Distribution

To install MySQL from a standard source distribution:

1. Verify that your system satisfies the tool requirements listed
   at [Section 2.8.2, “Source Installation Prerequisites”](source-installation-prerequisites.md "2.8.2 Source Installation Prerequisites").
2. Obtain a distribution file using the instructions in
   [Section 2.1.3, “How to Get MySQL”](getting-mysql.md "2.1.3 How to Get MySQL").
3. Configure, build, and install the distribution using the
   instructions in this section.
4. Perform postinstallation procedures using the instructions in
   [Section 2.9, “Postinstallation Setup and Testing”](postinstallation.md "2.9 Postinstallation Setup and Testing").

MySQL uses **CMake** as the build framework on all
platforms. The instructions given here should enable you to
produce a working installation. For additional information on
using **CMake** to build MySQL, see
[How to Build MySQL
Server with CMake](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/internals/en/cmake.html).

If you start from a source RPM, use the following command to make
a binary RPM that you can install. If you do not have
**rpmbuild**, use **rpm** instead.

```terminal
$> rpmbuild --rebuild --clean MySQL-VERSION.src.rpm
```

The result is one or more binary RPM packages that you install as
indicated in [Section 2.5.4, “Installing MySQL on Linux Using RPM Packages from Oracle”](linux-installation-rpm.md "2.5.4 Installing MySQL on Linux Using RPM Packages from Oracle").

The sequence for installation from a compressed
**tar** file or Zip archive source distribution is
similar to the process for installing from a generic binary
distribution (see [Section 2.2, “Installing MySQL on Unix/Linux Using Generic Binaries”](binary-installation.md "2.2 Installing MySQL on Unix/Linux Using Generic Binaries")), except
that it is used on all platforms and includes steps to configure
and compile the distribution. For example, with a compressed
**tar** file source distribution on Unix, the basic
installation command sequence looks like this:

```terminal
# Preconfiguration setup
$> groupadd mysql
$> useradd -r -g mysql -s /bin/false mysql
# Beginning of source-build specific instructions
$> tar zxvf mysql-VERSION.tar.gz
$> cd mysql-VERSION
$> mkdir bld
$> cd bld
$> cmake ..
$> make
$> make install
# End of source-build specific instructions
# Postinstallation setup
$> cd /usr/local/mysql
$> mkdir mysql-files
$> chown mysql:mysql mysql-files
$> chmod 750 mysql-files
$> bin/mysqld --initialize --user=mysql
$> bin/mysql_ssl_rsa_setup
$> bin/mysqld_safe --user=mysql &
# Next command is optional
$> cp support-files/mysql.server /etc/init.d/mysql.server
```

A more detailed version of the source-build specific instructions
is shown following.

Note

The procedure shown here does not set up any passwords for MySQL
accounts. After following the procedure, proceed to
[Section 2.9, “Postinstallation Setup and Testing”](postinstallation.md "2.9 Postinstallation Setup and Testing"), for postinstallation setup
and testing.

- [Perform Preconfiguration Setup](installing-source-distribution.md#installing-source-distribution-preconfiguration "Perform Preconfiguration Setup")
- [Obtain and Unpack the Distribution](installing-source-distribution.md#installing-source-distribution-obtain-distribution "Obtain and Unpack the Distribution")
- [Configure the Distribution](installing-source-distribution.md#installing-source-distribution-configure-distribution "Configure the Distribution")
- [Build the Distribution](installing-source-distribution.md#installing-source-distribution-build-distribution "Build the Distribution")
- [Install the Distribution](installing-source-distribution.md#installing-source-distribution-install-distribution "Install the Distribution")
- [Perform Postinstallation Setup](installing-source-distribution.md#installing-source-distribution-postinstallation "Perform Postinstallation Setup")

#### Perform Preconfiguration Setup

On Unix, set up the `mysql` user that owns the
database directory and that should be used to run and execute
the MySQL server, and the group to which this user belongs. For
details, see
[Create a mysql User and Group](binary-installation.md#binary-installation-createsysuser "Create a mysql User and Group"). Then
perform the following steps as the `mysql`
user, except as noted.

#### Obtain and Unpack the Distribution

Pick the directory under which you want to unpack the
distribution and change location into it.

Obtain a distribution file using the instructions in
[Section 2.1.3, “How to Get MySQL”](getting-mysql.md "2.1.3 How to Get MySQL").

Unpack the distribution into the current directory:

- To unpack a compressed **tar** file,
  **tar** can decompress and unpack the
  distribution if it has `z` option support:

  ```terminal
  $> tar zxvf mysql-VERSION.tar.gz
  ```

  If your **tar** does not have
  `z` option support, use
  **gunzip** to decompress the distribution and
  **tar** to unpack it:

  ```terminal
  $> gunzip < mysql-VERSION.tar.gz | tar xvf -
  ```

  Alternatively, **CMake** can decompress and
  unpack the distribution:

  ```terminal
  $> cmake -E tar zxvf mysql-VERSION.tar.gz
  ```
- To unpack a Zip archive, use **WinZip** or
  another tool that can read `.zip` files.

Unpacking the distribution file creates a directory named
`mysql-VERSION`.

#### Configure the Distribution

Change location into the top-level directory of the unpacked
distribution:

```terminal
$> cd mysql-VERSION
```

Build outside of the source tree to keep the tree clean. If the
top-level source directory is named
`mysql-src` under your current working
directory, you can build in a directory named
`build` at the same level. Create the
directory and go there:

```terminal
$> mkdir bld
$> cd bld
```

Configure the build directory. The minimum configuration command
includes no options to override configuration defaults:

```terminal
$> cmake ../mysql-src
```

The build directory need not be outside the source tree. For
example, you can build in a directory named
`build` under the top-level source tree. To
do this, starting with `mysql-src` as your
current working directory, create the directory
`build` and then go there:

```terminal
$> mkdir build
$> cd build
```

Configure the build directory. The minimum configuration command
includes no options to override configuration defaults:

```terminal
$> cmake ..
```

If you have multiple source trees at the same level (for
example, to build multiple versions of MySQL), the second
strategy can be advantageous. The first strategy places all
build directories at the same level, which requires that you
choose a unique name for each. With the second strategy, you can
use the same name for the build directory within each source
tree. The following instructions assume this second strategy.

On Windows, specify the development environment. For example,
the following commands configure MySQL for 32-bit or 64-bit
builds, respectively:

```terminal
$> cmake .. -G "Visual Studio 12 2013"

$> cmake .. -G "Visual Studio 12 2013 Win64"
```

On macOS, to use the Xcode IDE:

```terminal
$> cmake .. -G Xcode
```

When you run **Cmake**, you might want to add
options to the command line. Here are some examples:

- [`-DBUILD_CONFIG=mysql_release`](source-configuration-options.md#option_cmake_build_config):
  Configure the source with the same build options used by
  Oracle to produce binary distributions for official MySQL
  releases.
- [`-DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=dir_name`](source-configuration-options.md#option_cmake_cmake_install_prefix):
  Configure the distribution for installation under a
  particular location.
- [`-DCPACK_MONOLITHIC_INSTALL=1`](source-configuration-options.md#option_cmake_cpack_monolithic_install):
  Cause **make package** to generate a single
  installation file rather than multiple files.
- [`-DWITH_DEBUG=1`](source-configuration-options.md#option_cmake_with_debug): Build the
  distribution with debugging support.

For a more extensive list of options, see
[Section 2.8.7, “MySQL Source-Configuration Options”](source-configuration-options.md "2.8.7 MySQL Source-Configuration Options").

To list the configuration options, use one of the following
commands:

```terminal
$> cmake .. -L   # overview

$> cmake .. -LH  # overview with help text

$> cmake .. -LAH # all params with help text

$> ccmake ..     # interactive display
```

If **CMake** fails, you might need to reconfigure
by running it again with different options. If you do
reconfigure, take note of the following:

- If **CMake** is run after it has previously
  been run, it may use information that was gathered during
  its previous invocation. This information is stored in
  `CMakeCache.txt`. When
  **CMake** starts, it looks for that file and
  reads its contents if it exists, on the assumption that the
  information is still correct. That assumption is invalid
  when you reconfigure.
- Each time you run **CMake**, you must run
  **make** again to recompile. However, you may
  want to remove old object files from previous builds first
  because they were compiled using different configuration
  options.

To prevent old object files or configuration information from
being used, run these commands in the build directory on Unix
before re-running **CMake**:

```terminal
$> make clean
$> rm CMakeCache.txt
```

Or, on Windows:

```terminal
$> devenv MySQL.sln /clean
$> del CMakeCache.txt
```

Before asking on the
[MySQL Community
Slack](https://mysqlcommunity.slack.com/), check the files in the
`CMakeFiles` directory for useful information
about the failure. To file a bug report, please use the
instructions in [Section 1.5, “How to Report Bugs or Problems”](bug-reports.md "1.5 How to Report Bugs or Problems").

#### Build the Distribution

On Unix:

```terminal
$> make
$> make VERBOSE=1
```

The second command sets `VERBOSE` to show the
commands for each compiled source.

Use **gmake** instead on systems where you are
using GNU **make** and it has been installed as
**gmake**.

On Windows:

```terminal
$> devenv MySQL.sln /build RelWithDebInfo
```

If you have gotten to the compilation stage, but the
distribution does not build, see
[Section 2.8.8, “Dealing with Problems Compiling MySQL”](compilation-problems.md "2.8.8 Dealing with Problems Compiling MySQL"), for help. If that does
not solve the problem, please enter it into our bugs database
using the instructions given in [Section 1.5, “How to Report Bugs or Problems”](bug-reports.md "1.5 How to Report Bugs or Problems").
If you have installed the latest versions of the required tools,
and they crash trying to process our configuration files, please
report that also. However, if you get a `command not
found` error or a similar problem for required tools,
do not report it. Instead, make sure that all the required tools
are installed and that your `PATH` variable is
set correctly so that your shell can find them.

#### Install the Distribution

On Unix:

```terminal
$> make install
```

This installs the files under the configured installation
directory (by default, `/usr/local/mysql`).
You might need to run the command as `root`.

To install in a specific directory, add a
`DESTDIR` parameter to the command line:

```terminal
$> make install DESTDIR="/opt/mysql"
```

Alternatively, generate installation package files that you can
install where you like:

```terminal
$> make package
```

This operation produces one or more `.tar.gz`
files that can be installed like generic binary distribution
packages. See [Section 2.2, “Installing MySQL on Unix/Linux Using Generic Binaries”](binary-installation.md "2.2 Installing MySQL on Unix/Linux Using Generic Binaries"). If you run
**CMake** with
[`-DCPACK_MONOLITHIC_INSTALL=1`](source-configuration-options.md#option_cmake_cpack_monolithic_install), the
operation produces a single file. Otherwise, it produces
multiple files.

On Windows, generate the data directory, then create a
`.zip` archive installation package:

```terminal
$> devenv MySQL.sln /build RelWithDebInfo /project initial_database
$> devenv MySQL.sln /build RelWithDebInfo /project package
```

You can install the resulting `.zip` archive
where you like. See [Section 2.3.4, “Installing MySQL on Microsoft Windows Using a
`noinstall` ZIP Archive”](windows-install-archive.md "2.3.4 Installing MySQL on Microsoft Windows Using a noinstall ZIP Archive").

#### Perform Postinstallation Setup

The remainder of the installation process involves setting up
the configuration file, creating the core databases, and
starting the MySQL server. For instructions, see
[Section 2.9, “Postinstallation Setup and Testing”](postinstallation.md "2.9 Postinstallation Setup and Testing").

Note

The accounts that are listed in the MySQL grant tables
initially have no passwords. After starting the server, you
should set up passwords for them using the instructions in
[Section 2.9, “Postinstallation Setup and Testing”](postinstallation.md "2.9 Postinstallation Setup and Testing").
