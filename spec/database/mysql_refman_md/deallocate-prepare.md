### 15.5.3 DEALLOCATE PREPARE Statement

```sql
{DEALLOCATE | DROP} PREPARE stmt_name
```

To deallocate a prepared statement produced with
[`PREPARE`](prepare.md "15.5.1 PREPARE Statement"), use a
[`DEALLOCATE PREPARE`](deallocate-prepare.md "15.5.3 DEALLOCATE PREPARE Statement") statement that
refers to the prepared statement name. Attempting to execute a
prepared statement after deallocating it results in an error. If
too many prepared statements are created and not deallocated by
either the `DEALLOCATE PREPARE` statement or the
end of the session, you might encounter the upper limit enforced
by the [`max_prepared_stmt_count`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_max_prepared_stmt_count)
system variable.

For examples, see [Section 15.5, “Prepared Statements”](sql-prepared-statements.md "15.5 Prepared Statements").
