## 29.6 Performance Schema Instrument Naming Conventions

An instrument name consists of a sequence of elements separated by
`'/'` characters. Example names:

```none
wait/io/file/myisam/log
wait/io/file/mysys/charset
wait/lock/table/sql/handler
wait/synch/cond/mysys/COND_alarm
wait/synch/cond/sql/BINLOG::update_cond
wait/synch/mutex/mysys/BITMAP_mutex
wait/synch/mutex/sql/LOCK_delete
wait/synch/rwlock/sql/Query_cache_query::lock
stage/sql/closing tables
stage/sql/Sorting result
statement/com/Execute
statement/com/Query
statement/sql/create_table
statement/sql/lock_tables
errors
```

The instrument name space has a tree-like structure. The elements
of an instrument name from left to right provide a progression
from more general to more specific. The number of elements a name
has depends on the type of instrument.

The interpretation of a given element in a name depends on the
elements to the left of it. For example, `myisam`
appears in both of the following names, but
`myisam` in the first name is related to file
I/O, whereas in the second it is related to a synchronization
instrument:

```none
wait/io/file/myisam/log
wait/synch/cond/myisam/MI_SORT_INFO::cond
```

Instrument names consist of a prefix with a structure defined by
the Performance Schema implementation and a suffix defined by the
developer implementing the instrument code. The top-level element
of an instrument prefix indicates the type of instrument. This
element also determines which event timer in the
[`performance_timers`](performance-schema-performance-timers-table.md "29.12.21.6 The performance_timers Table") table applies to
the instrument. For the prefix part of instrument names, the top
level indicates the type of instrument.

The suffix part of instrument names comes from the code for the
instruments themselves. Suffixes may include levels such as these:

- A name for the major element (a server module such as
  `myisam`, `innodb`,
  `mysys`, or `sql`) or a
  plugin name.
- The name of a variable in the code, in the form
  *`XXX`* (a global variable) or
  `CCC::MMM`
  (a member *`MMM`* in class
  *`CCC`*). Examples:
  `COND_thread_cache`,
  `THR_LOCK_myisam`,
  `BINLOG::LOCK_index`.

### Top-Level Instrument Elements

- `idle`: An instrumented idle event. This
  instrument has no further elements.
- `error`: An instrumented error event. This
  instrument has no further elements.
- `memory`: An instrumented memory event.
- `stage`: An instrumented stage event.
- `statement`: An instrumented statement
  event.
- `transaction`: An instrumented transaction
  event. This instrument has no further elements.
- `wait`: An instrumented wait event.

### Idle Instrument Elements

The `idle` instrument is used for idle events,
which The Performance Schema generates as discussed in the
description of the `socket_instances.STATE`
column in
[Section 29.12.3.5, “The socket\_instances Table”](performance-schema-socket-instances-table.md "29.12.3.5 The socket_instances Table").

### Error Instrument Elements

The `error` instrument indicates whether to
collect information for server errors and warnings. This
instrument is enabled by default. The `TIMED`
column for the `error` row in the
[`setup_instruments`](performance-schema-setup-instruments-table.md "29.12.2.3 The setup_instruments Table") table is
inapplicable because timing information is not collected.

### Memory Instrument Elements

Memory instrumentation is enabled by default. Memory
instrumentation can be enabled or disabled at startup, or
dynamically at runtime by updating the
`ENABLED` column of the relevant instruments in
the [`setup_instruments`](performance-schema-setup-instruments-table.md "29.12.2.3 The setup_instruments Table") table. Memory
instruments have names of the form
`memory/code_area/instrument_name`
where *`code_area`* is a value such as
`sql` or `myisam`, and
*`instrument_name`* is the instrument
detail.

Instruments named with the prefix
`memory/performance_schema/` expose how much
memory is allocated for internal buffers in the Performance
Schema. The `memory/performance_schema/`
instruments are built in, always enabled, and cannot be disabled
at startup or runtime. Built-in memory instruments are displayed
only in the
[`memory_summary_global_by_event_name`](performance-schema-memory-summary-tables.md "29.12.20.10 Memory Summary Tables")
table. For more information, see
[Section 29.17, “The Performance Schema Memory-Allocation Model”](performance-schema-memory-model.md "29.17 The Performance Schema Memory-Allocation Model").

### Stage Instrument Elements

Stage instruments have names of the form
`stage/code_area/stage_name`,
where *`code_area`* is a value such as
`sql` or `myisam`, and
*`stage_name`* indicates the stage of
statement processing, such as `Sorting result`
or `Sending data`. Stages correspond to the
thread states displayed by [`SHOW
PROCESSLIST`](show-processlist.md "15.7.7.29 SHOW PROCESSLIST Statement") or that are visible in the Information
Schema [`PROCESSLIST`](information-schema-processlist-table.md "28.3.23 The INFORMATION_SCHEMA PROCESSLIST Table") table.

### Statement Instrument Elements

- `statement/abstract/*`: An abstract
  instrument for statement operations. Abstract instruments
  are used during the early stages of statement classification
  before the exact statement type is known, then changed to a
  more specific statement instrument when the type is known.
  For a description of this process, see
  [Section 29.12.6, “Performance Schema Statement Event Tables”](performance-schema-statement-tables.md "29.12.6 Performance Schema Statement Event Tables").
- `statement/com`: An instrumented command
  operation. These have names corresponding to
  `COM_xxx`
  operations (see the `mysql_com.h` header
  file and `sql/sql_parse.cc`. For example,
  the `statement/com/Connect` and
  `statement/com/Init DB` instruments
  correspond to the `COM_CONNECT` and
  `COM_INIT_DB` commands.
- `statement/scheduler/event`: A single
  instrument to track all events executed by the Event
  Scheduler. This instrument comes into play when a scheduled
  event begins executing.
- `statement/sp`: An instrumented internal
  instruction executed by a stored program. For example, the
  `statement/sp/cfetch` and
  `statement/sp/freturn` instruments are used
  cursor fetch and function return instructions.
- `statement/sql`: An instrumented SQL
  statement operation. For example, the
  `statement/sql/create_db` and
  `statement/sql/select` instruments are used
  for [`CREATE DATABASE`](create-database.md "15.1.12 CREATE DATABASE Statement") and
  [`SELECT`](select.md "15.2.13 SELECT Statement") statements.

### Thread Instrument Elements

Instrumented threads are displayed in the
[`setup_threads`](performance-schema-setup-threads-table.md "29.12.2.5 The setup_threads Table") table, which exposes
thread class names and attributes.

Thread instruments begin with `thread` (for
example, `thread/sql/parser_service` or
`thread/performance_schema/setup`).

The names of thread instruments for
`ndbcluster` plugin threads begin with
`thread/ndbcluster/`; for more information
about these, see [ndbcluster Plugin Threads](mysql-cluster-ps-tables.md#mysql-cluster-plugin-threads "ndbcluster Plugin Threads").

### Wait Instrument Elements

- `wait/io`

  An instrumented I/O operation.

  - `wait/io/file`

    An instrumented file I/O operation. For files, the wait
    is the time waiting for the file operation to complete
    (for example, a call to `fwrite()`).
    Due to caching, the physical file I/O on the disk might
    not happen within this call.
  - `wait/io/socket`

    An instrumented socket operation. Socket instruments
    have names of the form
    `wait/io/socket/sql/socket_type`.
    The server has a listening socket for each network
    protocol that it supports. The instruments associated
    with listening sockets for TCP/IP or Unix socket file
    connections have a
    *`socket_type`* value of
    `server_tcpip_socket` or
    `server_unix_socket`, respectively.
    When a listening socket detects a connection, the server
    transfers the connection to a new socket managed by a
    separate thread. The instrument for the new connection
    thread has a *`socket_type`*
    value of `client_connection`.
  - `wait/io/table`

    An instrumented table I/O operation. These include
    row-level accesses to persistent base tables or
    temporary tables. Operations that affect rows are fetch,
    insert, update, and delete. For a view, waits are
    associated with base tables referenced by the view.

    Unlike most waits, a table I/O wait can include other
    waits. For example, table I/O might include file I/O or
    memory operations. Thus,
    [`events_waits_current`](performance-schema-events-waits-current-table.md "29.12.4.1 The events_waits_current Table") for a
    table I/O wait usually has two rows. For more
    information, see
    [Section 29.8, “Performance Schema Atom and Molecule Events”](performance-schema-atom-molecule-events.md "29.8 Performance Schema Atom and Molecule Events").

    Some row operations might cause multiple table I/O
    waits. For example, an insert might activate a trigger
    that causes an update.
- `wait/lock`

  An instrumented lock operation.

  - `wait/lock/table`

    An instrumented table lock operation.
  - `wait/lock/metadata/sql/mdl`

    An instrumented metadata lock operation.
- `wait/synch`

  An instrumented synchronization object. For synchronization
  objects, the `TIMER_WAIT` time includes the
  amount of time blocked while attempting to acquire a lock on
  the object, if any.

  - `wait/synch/cond`

    A condition is used by one thread to signal to other
    threads that something they were waiting for has
    happened. If a single thread was waiting for a
    condition, it can wake up and proceed with its
    execution. If several threads were waiting, they can all
    wake up and compete for the resource for which they were
    waiting.
  - `wait/synch/mutex`

    A mutual exclusion object used to permit access to a
    resource (such as a section of executable code) while
    preventing other threads from accessing the resource.
  - `wait/synch/prlock`

    A priority [rwlock](glossary.md#glos_rw_lock "rw-lock")
    lock object.
  - `wait/synch/rwlock`

    A plain [read/write
    lock](glossary.md#glos_rw_lock "rw-lock") object used to lock a specific variable for
    access while preventing its use by other threads. A
    shared read lock can be acquired simultaneously by
    multiple threads. An exclusive write lock can be
    acquired by only one thread at a time.
  - `wait/synch/sxlock`

    A shared-exclusive (SX) lock is a type of
    [rwlock](glossary.md#glos_rw_lock "rw-lock") lock object
    that provides write access to a common resource while
    permitting inconsistent reads by other threads.
    `sxlocks` optimize concurrency and
    improve scalability for read-write workloads.
