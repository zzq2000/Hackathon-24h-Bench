## 13.8 Choosing the Right Type for a Column

For optimum storage, you should try to use the most precise type
in all cases. For example, if an integer column is used for values
in the range from `1` to
`99999`, `MEDIUMINT UNSIGNED` is
the best type. Of the types that represent all the required
values, this type uses the least amount of storage.

All basic calculations (`+`,
`-`, `*`, and
`/`) with [`DECIMAL`](fixed-point-types.md "13.1.3 Fixed-Point Types (Exact Value) - DECIMAL, NUMERIC")
columns are done with precision of 65 decimal (base 10) digits.
See [Section 13.1.1, “Numeric Data Type Syntax”](numeric-type-syntax.md "13.1.1 Numeric Data Type Syntax").

If accuracy is not too important or if speed is the highest
priority, the [`DOUBLE`](floating-point-types.md "13.1.4 Floating-Point Types (Approximate Value) - FLOAT, DOUBLE") type may be
good enough. For high precision, you can always convert to a
fixed-point type stored in a
[`BIGINT`](integer-types.md "13.1.2 Integer Types (Exact Value) - INTEGER, INT, SMALLINT, TINYINT, MEDIUMINT, BIGINT"). This enables you to do all
calculations with 64-bit integers and then convert results back to
floating-point values as necessary.
