#### 25.4.3.11 NDB Cluster TCP/IP Connections Using Direct Connections

Setting up a cluster using direct connections between data nodes
requires specifying explicitly the crossover IP addresses of the
data nodes so connected in the `[tcp]` section
of the cluster `config.ini` file.

In the following example, we envision a cluster with at least
four hosts, one each for a management server, an SQL node, and
two data nodes. The cluster as a whole resides on the
`172.23.72.*` subnet of a LAN. In addition to
the usual network connections, the two data nodes are connected
directly using a standard crossover cable, and communicate with
one another directly using IP addresses in the
`1.1.0.*` address range as shown:

```ini
# Management Server
[ndb_mgmd]
Id=1
HostName=172.23.72.20

# SQL Node
[mysqld]
Id=2
HostName=172.23.72.21

# Data Nodes
[ndbd]
Id=3
HostName=172.23.72.22

[ndbd]
Id=4
HostName=172.23.72.23

# TCP/IP Connections
[tcp]
NodeId1=3
NodeId2=4
HostName1=1.1.0.1
HostName2=1.1.0.2
```

The [`HostName1`](mysql-cluster-tcp-definition.md#ndbparam-tcp-hostname1) and
[`HostName2`](mysql-cluster-tcp-definition.md#ndbparam-tcp-hostname2) parameters are
used only when specifying direct connections.

The use of direct TCP connections between data nodes can improve
the cluster's overall efficiency by enabling the data nodes to
bypass an Ethernet device such as a switch, hub, or router, thus
cutting down on the cluster's latency.

Note

To take the best advantage of direct connections in this
fashion with more than two data nodes, you must have a direct
connection between each data node and every other data node in
the same node group.
