#### 25.6.14.2 NDB File System Encryption Implementation

For `NDB` Transparent Data Encryption (TDE),
data nodes encrypt user data at rest, with security provided by
a password (file system password), which is used to encrypt and
decrypt a secrets file on each data node. The secrets file
contains a Node Master Key (NMK), a key used later to encrypt
the different file types used for persistence.
`NDB` TDE encrypts user data files including
LCP files, redo log files, tablespace files, and undo log files.

You can use the [**ndbxfrm**](mysql-cluster-programs-ndbxfrm.md "25.5.31 ndbxfrm — Compress, Decompress, Encrypt, and Decrypt Files Created by NDB Cluster") utility to see
whether a file is encrypted, as shown here:

```terminal
> ndbxfrm -i ndb_5_fs/LCP/0/T2F0.Data
File=ndb_5_fs/LCP/0/T2F0.Data, compression=no, encryption=yes
> ndbxfrm -i ndb_6_fs/LCP/0/T2F0.Data
File=ndb_6_fs/LCP/0/T2F0.Data, compression=no, encryption=no
```

Beginning with NDB 8.0.31, it is possible to obtain the key from
the secrets file using the
[**ndb\_secretsfile\_reader**](mysql-cluster-programs-ndb-secretsfile-reader.md "25.5.24 ndb_secretsfile_reader — Obtain Key Information from an Encrypted NDB Data File") program added in that
release, like this:

```terminal
> ndb_secretsfile_reader --filesystem-password=54kl14 ndb_5_fs/D1/NDBCNTR/S0.sysfile
ndb_secretsfile_reader: [Warning] Using a password on the command line interface can be insecure.

```

The per-node key hierarchy can be represented as follows:

- A user-supplied passphrase (P) is processed by a
  key-derivation function using a random salt to generate a
  unique passphase key (PK).
- The PK (unique to each node) encrypts the data on each node
  in its own secrets file.
- The data in the secrets file includes a unique, randomly
  generated Node Master Key (NMK).
- The NMK encrypts (using wrapping) one or more randomly
  generated data encryption key (DEK) values in the header of
  each encrypted file (including LCP and TS files, and redo
  and undo logs).
- Data encryption key values (DEK0,
  ..., DEKn) are used for encryption of
  [subsets of] data in each file.

The passphrase indirectly encrypts the secrets file containing
the random NMK, which encrypts a portion of the header of each
encrypted file on the node. The encrypted file header contains
random data keys used for the data in that file.

Encryption is implemented transparently by the
[`NDBFS`](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/ndb-internals/en/ndb-internals-kernel-blocks-ndbfs.html) layer within the data
nodes. `NDBFS` internal client blocks operate
on their files as normal; `NDBFS` wraps the
physical file with extra header and footer information
supporting encryption, and encrypts and decrypts data as it is
read from and written to the file. The wrapped file format is
referred to as `ndbxfrm1`.

The node password is processed with PBKDF2 and the random salt
to encrypt the secrets file, which contains the randomly
generated NMK which is used to encrypt the randomly generated
data encryption key in each encrypted file.

The work of encryption and decryption is performed in the NDBFS
I/O threads (rather than in signal execution threads such as
main, tc, ldm, or rep). This is similar to what happens with
compressed LCPs and compressed backups, and normally results in
increased I/O thread CPU usage; you may wish to adjust
[`ThreadConfig`](mysql-cluster-ndbd-definition.md#ndbparam-ndbmtd-threadconfig) (if in
use) with regard to the I/O threads.
