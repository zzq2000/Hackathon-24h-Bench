### 28.3.15 The INFORMATION\_SCHEMA FILES Table

The `FILES` table provides information about the
files in which MySQL tablespace data is stored.

The `FILES` table provides information about
`InnoDB` data files. In NDB Cluster, this table
also provides information about the files in which NDB Cluster
Disk Data tables are stored. For additional information specific
to `InnoDB`, see
[InnoDB Notes](information-schema-files-table.md#files-table-innodb-notes "InnoDB Notes"), later in this section;
for additional information specific to NDB Cluster, see
[NDB Notes](information-schema-files-table.md#files-table-ndb-notes "NDB Notes").

The `FILES` table has these columns:

- `FILE_ID`

  For `InnoDB`: The tablespace ID, also
  referred to as the `space_id` or
  `fil_space_t::id`.

  For `NDB`: A file identifier.
  `FILE_ID` column values are auto-generated.
- `FILE_NAME`

  For `InnoDB`: The name of the data file.
  File-per-table and general tablespaces have an
  `.ibd` file name extension. Undo
  tablespaces are prefixed by `undo`. The
  system tablespace is prefixed by `ibdata`.
  The global temporary tablespace is prefixed by
  `ibtmp`. The file name includes the file
  path, which may be relative to the MySQL data directory (the
  value of the [`datadir`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_datadir) system
  variable).

  For `NDB`: The name of an undo log file
  created by [`CREATE LOGFILE GROUP`](create-logfile-group.md "15.1.16 CREATE LOGFILE GROUP Statement")
  or [`ALTER LOGFILE GROUP`](alter-logfile-group.md "15.1.6 ALTER LOGFILE GROUP Statement"), or of a
  data file created by [`CREATE
  TABLESPACE`](create-tablespace.md "15.1.21 CREATE TABLESPACE Statement") or [`ALTER
  TABLESPACE`](alter-tablespace.md "15.1.10 ALTER TABLESPACE Statement"). In NDB 8.0, the file name is shown with
  a relative path; for an undo log file, this path is relative
  to the directory
  `DataDir/ndb_NodeId_fs/LG`;
  for a data file, it is relative to the directory
  `DataDir/ndb_NodeId_fs/TS`.
  This means, for example, that the name of a data file created
  with `ALTER TABLESPACE ts ADD DATAFILE 'data_2.dat'
  INITIAL SIZE 256M` is shown as
  `./data_2.dat`.
- `FILE_TYPE`

  For `InnoDB`: The tablespace file type. There
  are three possible file types for `InnoDB`
  files. `TABLESPACE` is the file type for any
  system, general, or file-per-table tablespace file that holds
  tables, indexes, or other forms of user data.
  `TEMPORARY` is the file type for temporary
  tablespaces. `UNDO LOG` is the file type for
  undo tablespaces, which hold undo records.

  For `NDB`: One of the values `UNDO
  LOG` or `DATAFILE`. Prior to NDB
  8.0.13, `TABLESPACE` was also a possible
  value.
- `TABLESPACE_NAME`

  The name of the tablespace with which the file is associated.

  For `InnoDB`: General tablespace names are as
  specified when created. File-per-table tablespace names are
  shown in the following format:
  `schema_name/table_name`.
  The `InnoDB` system tablespace name is
  `innodb_system`. The global temporary
  tablespace name is `innodb_temporary`.
  Default undo tablespace names are
  `innodb_undo_001` and
  `innodb_undo_002`. User-created undo
  tablespace names are as specified when created.
- `TABLE_CATALOG`

  This value is always empty.
- `TABLE_SCHEMA`

  This is always `NULL`.
- `TABLE_NAME`

  This is always `NULL`.
- `LOGFILE_GROUP_NAME`

  For `InnoDB`: This is always
  `NULL`.

  For `NDB`: The name of the log file group to
  which the log file or data file belongs.
- `LOGFILE_GROUP_NUMBER`

  For `InnoDB`: This is always
  `NULL`.

  For `NDB`: For a Disk Data undo log file, the
  auto-generated ID number of the log file group to which the
  log file belongs. This is the same as the value shown for the
  `id` column in the
  [`ndbinfo.dict_obj_info`](mysql-cluster-ndbinfo-dict-obj-info.md "25.6.16.24 The ndbinfo dict_obj_info Table") table
  and the `log_id` column in the
  [`ndbinfo.logspaces`](mysql-cluster-ndbinfo-logspaces.md "25.6.16.43 The ndbinfo logspaces Table") and
  [`ndbinfo.logspaces`](mysql-cluster-ndbinfo-logspaces.md "25.6.16.43 The ndbinfo logspaces Table") tables for
  this undo log file.
- `ENGINE`

  For `InnoDB`: This value is always
  `InnoDB`.

  For `NDB`: This value is always
  `ndbcluster`.
- `FULLTEXT_KEYS`

  This is always `NULL`.
- `DELETED_ROWS`

  This is always `NULL`.
- `UPDATE_COUNT`

  This is always `NULL`.
- `FREE_EXTENTS`

  For `InnoDB`: The number of fully free
  extents in the current data file.

  For `NDB`: The number of extents which have
  not yet been used by the file.
- `TOTAL_EXTENTS`

  For `InnoDB`: The number of full extents used
  in the current data file. Any partial extent at the end of the
  file is not counted.

  For `NDB`: The total number of extents
  allocated to the file.
- `EXTENT_SIZE`

  For `InnoDB`: Extent size is 1048576 (1MB)
  for files with a 4KB, 8KB, or 16KB page size. Extent size is
  2097152 bytes (2MB) for files with a 32KB page size, and
  4194304 (4MB) for files with a 64KB page size.
  [`FILES`](information-schema-files-table.md "28.3.15 The INFORMATION_SCHEMA FILES Table") does not report
  `InnoDB` page size. Page size is defined by
  the [`innodb_page_size`](innodb-parameters.md#sysvar_innodb_page_size) system
  variable. Extent size information can also be retrieved from
  the [`INNODB_TABLESPACES`](information-schema-innodb-tablespaces-table.md "28.4.24 The INFORMATION_SCHEMA INNODB_TABLESPACES Table") table
  where `FILES.FILE_ID =
  INNODB_TABLESPACES.SPACE`.

  For `NDB`: The size of an extent for the file
  in bytes.
- `INITIAL_SIZE`

  For `InnoDB`: The initial size of the file in
  bytes.

  For `NDB`: The size of the file in bytes.
  This is the same value that was used in the
  `INITIAL_SIZE` clause of the
  [`CREATE LOGFILE GROUP`](create-logfile-group.md "15.1.16 CREATE LOGFILE GROUP Statement"),
  [`ALTER LOGFILE GROUP`](alter-logfile-group.md "15.1.6 ALTER LOGFILE GROUP Statement"),
  [`CREATE TABLESPACE`](create-tablespace.md "15.1.21 CREATE TABLESPACE Statement"), or
  [`ALTER TABLESPACE`](alter-tablespace.md "15.1.10 ALTER TABLESPACE Statement") statement used
  to create the file.
- `MAXIMUM_SIZE`

  For `InnoDB`: The maximum number of bytes
  permitted in the file. The value is `NULL`
  for all data files except for predefined system tablespace
  data files. Maximum system tablespace file size is defined by
  [`innodb_data_file_path`](innodb-parameters.md#sysvar_innodb_data_file_path).
  Maximum global temporary tablespace file size is defined by
  [`innodb_temp_data_file_path`](innodb-parameters.md#sysvar_innodb_temp_data_file_path). A
  `NULL` value for a predefined system
  tablespace data file indicates that a file size limit was not
  defined explicitly.

  For `NDB`: This value is always the same as
  the `INITIAL_SIZE` value.
- `AUTOEXTEND_SIZE`

  The auto-extend size of the tablespace. For
  `NDB`, `AUTOEXTEND_SIZE` is
  always `NULL`.
- `CREATION_TIME`

  This is always `NULL`.
- `LAST_UPDATE_TIME`

  This is always `NULL`.
- `LAST_ACCESS_TIME`

  This is always `NULL`.
- `RECOVER_TIME`

  This is always `NULL`.
- `TRANSACTION_COUNTER`

  This is always `NULL`.
- `VERSION`

  For `InnoDB`: This is always
  `NULL`.

  For `NDB`: The version number of the file.
- `ROW_FORMAT`

  For `InnoDB`: This is always
  `NULL`.

  For `NDB`: One of `FIXED` or
  `DYNAMIC`.
- `TABLE_ROWS`

  This is always `NULL`.
- `AVG_ROW_LENGTH`

  This is always `NULL`.
- `DATA_LENGTH`

  This is always `NULL`.
- `MAX_DATA_LENGTH`

  This is always `NULL`.
- `INDEX_LENGTH`

  This is always `NULL`.
- `DATA_FREE`

  For `InnoDB`: The total amount of free space
  (in bytes) for the entire tablespace. Predefined system
  tablespaces, which include the system tablespace and temporary
  table tablespaces, may have one or more data files.

  For `NDB`: This is always
  `NULL`.
- `CREATE_TIME`

  This is always `NULL`.
- `UPDATE_TIME`

  This is always `NULL`.
- `CHECK_TIME`

  This is always `NULL`.
- `CHECKSUM`

  This is always `NULL`.
- `STATUS`

  For `InnoDB`: This value is
  `NORMAL` by default.
  `InnoDB` file-per-table tablespaces may
  report `IMPORTING`, which indicates that the
  tablespace is not yet available.

  For `NDB`: For NDB Cluster Disk Data files,
  this value is always `NORMAL`.
- `EXTRA`

  For `InnoDB`: This is always
  `NULL`.

  For `NDB`: (*NDB 8.0.15 and
  later*) For undo log files, this column shows the
  undo log buffer size; for data files, it is always
  *NULL*. A more detailed explanation is
  provided in the next few paragraphs.

  [`NDBCLUSTER`](mysql-cluster.md "Chapter 25 MySQL NDB Cluster 8.0") stores a copy of each
  data file and each undo log file on each data node in the
  cluster. In NDB 8.0.13 and later, the `FILES`
  table contains only one row for each such file. Suppose that
  you run the following two statements on an NDB Cluster with
  four data nodes:

  ```sql
  CREATE LOGFILE GROUP mygroup
      ADD UNDOFILE 'new_undo.dat'
      INITIAL_SIZE 2G
      ENGINE NDBCLUSTER;

  CREATE TABLESPACE myts
      ADD DATAFILE 'data_1.dat'
      USE LOGFILE GROUP mygroup
      INITIAL_SIZE 256M
      ENGINE NDBCLUSTER;
  ```

  After running these two statements successfully, you should
  see a result similar to the one shown here for this query
  against the [`FILES`](information-schema-files-table.md "28.3.15 The INFORMATION_SCHEMA FILES Table") table:

  ```sql
  mysql> SELECT LOGFILE_GROUP_NAME, FILE_TYPE, EXTRA
      ->     FROM INFORMATION_SCHEMA.FILES
      ->     WHERE ENGINE = 'ndbcluster';

  +--------------------+-----------+--------------------------+
  | LOGFILE_GROUP_NAME | FILE_TYPE | EXTRA                    |
  +--------------------+-----------+--------------------------+
  | mygroup            | UNDO LOG  | UNDO_BUFFER_SIZE=8388608 |
  | mygroup            | DATAFILE  | NULL                     |
  +--------------------+-----------+--------------------------+
  ```

  The undo log buffer size information was inadvertently removed
  in NDB 8.0.13, but was restored in NDB 8.0.15. (Bug #92796,
  Bug #28800252)

  Prior to NDB 8.0.13, the `FILES` table
  contained a row for each of these files on each data node the
  file belonged to, as well as the size of its undo buffer. In
  these versions, the result of the same query contains one row
  per data node, as shown here:

  ```sql
  +--------------------+-----------+-----------------------------------------+
  | LOGFILE_GROUP_NAME | FILE_TYPE | EXTRA                                   |
  +--------------------+-----------+-----------------------------------------+
  | mygroup            | UNDO LOG  | CLUSTER_NODE=5;UNDO_BUFFER_SIZE=8388608 |
  | mygroup            | UNDO LOG  | CLUSTER_NODE=6;UNDO_BUFFER_SIZE=8388608 |
  | mygroup            | UNDO LOG  | CLUSTER_NODE=7;UNDO_BUFFER_SIZE=8388608 |
  | mygroup            | UNDO LOG  | CLUSTER_NODE=8;UNDO_BUFFER_SIZE=8388608 |
  | mygroup            | DATAFILE  | CLUSTER_NODE=5                          |
  | mygroup            | DATAFILE  | CLUSTER_NODE=6                          |
  | mygroup            | DATAFILE  | CLUSTER_NODE=7                          |
  | mygroup            | DATAFILE  | CLUSTER_NODE=8                          |
  +--------------------+-----------+-----------------------------------------+
  ```

#### Notes

- [`FILES`](information-schema-files-table.md "28.3.15 The INFORMATION_SCHEMA FILES Table") is a nonstandard
  `INFORMATION_SCHEMA` table.
- As of MySQL 8.0.21, you must have the
  [`PROCESS`](privileges-provided.md#priv_process) privilege to query
  this table.

#### InnoDB Notes

The following notes apply to `InnoDB` data
files.

- Information reported by `FILES` is obtained
  from the `InnoDB` in-memory cache for open
  files, whereas [`INNODB_DATAFILES`](information-schema-innodb-datafiles-table.md "28.4.10 The INFORMATION_SCHEMA INNODB_DATAFILES Table")
  gets its data from the `InnoDB`
  `SYS_DATAFILES` internal data dictionary
  table.
- The information provided by `FILES`
  includes global temporary tablespace information which is
  not available in the `InnoDB`
  `SYS_DATAFILES` internal data dictionary
  table, and is therefore not included in
  [`INNODB_DATAFILES`](information-schema-innodb-datafiles-table.md "28.4.10 The INFORMATION_SCHEMA INNODB_DATAFILES Table").
- Undo tablespace information is shown in
  `FILES` when separate undo tablespaces are
  present, as they are by default in MySQL 8.0.
- The following query returns all `FILES`
  table information relating to `InnoDB`
  tablespaces.

  ```sql
  SELECT
    FILE_ID, FILE_NAME, FILE_TYPE, TABLESPACE_NAME, FREE_EXTENTS,
    TOTAL_EXTENTS, EXTENT_SIZE, INITIAL_SIZE, MAXIMUM_SIZE,
    AUTOEXTEND_SIZE, DATA_FREE, STATUS
  FROM INFORMATION_SCHEMA.FILES
  WHERE ENGINE='InnoDB'\G
  ```

#### NDB Notes

- The `FILES` table provides information
  about Disk Data *files* only; you cannot
  use it for determining disk space allocation or availability
  for individual `NDB` tables. However, it is
  possible to see how much space is allocated for each
  [`NDB`](mysql-cluster.md "Chapter 25 MySQL NDB Cluster 8.0") table having data stored on
  disk—as well as how much remains available for storage
  of data on disk for that table—using
  [**ndb\_desc**](mysql-cluster-programs-ndb-desc.md "25.5.9 ndb_desc — Describe NDB Tables").
- Beginning with NDB 8.0.29 much of the information in the
  `FILES` table can also be found in the
  [`ndbinfo.files`](mysql-cluster-ndbinfo-files.md "25.6.16.35 The ndbinfo files Table") table.
- The `CREATION_TIME`,
  `LAST_UPDATE_TIME`, and
  `LAST_ACCESSED` values are as reported by
  the operating system, and are not supplied by the
  [`NDB`](mysql-cluster.md "Chapter 25 MySQL NDB Cluster 8.0") storage engine. Where no
  value is provided by the operating system, these columns
  display `NULL`.
- The difference between the `TOTAL EXTENTS`
  and `FREE_EXTENTS` columns is the number of
  extents currently in use by the file:

  ```sql
  SELECT TOTAL_EXTENTS - FREE_EXTENTS AS extents_used
      FROM INFORMATION_SCHEMA.FILES
      WHERE FILE_NAME = './myfile.dat';
  ```

  To approximate the amount of disk space in use by the file,
  multiply that difference by the value of the
  `EXTENT_SIZE` column, which gives the size
  of an extent for the file in bytes:

  ```sql
  SELECT (TOTAL_EXTENTS - FREE_EXTENTS) * EXTENT_SIZE AS bytes_used
      FROM INFORMATION_SCHEMA.FILES
      WHERE FILE_NAME = './myfile.dat';
  ```

  Similarly, you can estimate the amount of space that remains
  available in a given file by multiplying
  `FREE_EXTENTS` by
  `EXTENT_SIZE`:

  ```sql
  SELECT FREE_EXTENTS * EXTENT_SIZE AS bytes_free
      FROM INFORMATION_SCHEMA.FILES
      WHERE FILE_NAME = './myfile.dat';
  ```

  Important

  The byte values produced by the preceding queries are
  approximations only, and their precision is inversely
  proportional to the value of
  `EXTENT_SIZE`. That is, the larger
  `EXTENT_SIZE` becomes, the less accurate
  the approximations are.

  It is also important to remember that once an extent is
  used, it cannot be freed again without dropping the data
  file of which it is a part. This means that deletes from a
  Disk Data table do *not* release disk
  space.

  The extent size can be set in a [`CREATE
  TABLESPACE`](create-tablespace.md "15.1.21 CREATE TABLESPACE Statement") statement. For more information, see
  [Section 15.1.21, “CREATE TABLESPACE Statement”](create-tablespace.md "15.1.21 CREATE TABLESPACE Statement").
- Prior to NDB 8.0.13, an additional row was present in the
  [`FILES`](information-schema-files-table.md "28.3.15 The INFORMATION_SCHEMA FILES Table") table following the
  creation of a logfile group, having `NULL`
  in the `FILE_NAME` column. In NDB 8.0.13
  and later, this row— which did not correspond to any
  file—is no longer shown, and it is necessary to query
  the [`ndbinfo.logspaces`](mysql-cluster-ndbinfo-logspaces.md "25.6.16.43 The ndbinfo logspaces Table")
  table to obtain undo log file usage information. See the
  description of this table as well as
  [Section 25.6.11.1, “NDB Cluster Disk Data Objects”](mysql-cluster-disk-data-objects.md "25.6.11.1 NDB Cluster Disk Data Objects"), for more
  information.

  The remainder of the discussion in this item applies only to
  NDB 8.0.12 and earlier. For the row having
  `NULL` in the `FILE_NAME`
  column, the value of the `FILE_ID` column
  is always `0`, that of the
  `FILE_TYPE` column is always `UNDO
  LOG`, and that of the `STATUS`
  column is always `NORMAL`. The value of the
  `ENGINE` column is always
  `ndbcluster`.

  The `FREE_EXTENTS` column in this row shows
  the total number of free extents available to all undo files
  belonging to a given log file group whose name and number
  are shown in the `LOGFILE_GROUP_NAME` and
  `LOGFILE_GROUP_NUMBER` columns,
  respectively.

  Suppose there are no existing log file groups on your NDB
  Cluster, and you create one using the following statement:

  ```sql
  mysql> CREATE LOGFILE GROUP lg1
           ADD UNDOFILE 'undofile.dat'
           INITIAL_SIZE = 16M
           UNDO_BUFFER_SIZE = 1M
           ENGINE = NDB;
  ```

  You can now see this `NULL` row when you
  query the [`FILES`](information-schema-files-table.md "28.3.15 The INFORMATION_SCHEMA FILES Table") table:

  ```sql
  mysql> SELECT DISTINCT
           FILE_NAME AS File,
           FREE_EXTENTS AS Free,
           TOTAL_EXTENTS AS Total,
           EXTENT_SIZE AS Size,
           INITIAL_SIZE AS Initial
           FROM INFORMATION_SCHEMA.FILES;
  +--------------+---------+---------+------+----------+
  | File         | Free    | Total   | Size | Initial  |
  +--------------+---------+---------+------+----------+
  | undofile.dat |    NULL | 4194304 |    4 | 16777216 |
  | NULL         | 4184068 |    NULL |    4 |     NULL |
  +--------------+---------+---------+------+----------+
  ```

  The total number of free extents available for undo logging
  is always somewhat less than the sum of the
  `TOTAL_EXTENTS` column values for all undo
  files in the log file group due to overhead required for
  maintaining the undo files. This can be seen by adding a
  second undo file to the log file group, then repeating the
  previous query against the
  [`FILES`](information-schema-files-table.md "28.3.15 The INFORMATION_SCHEMA FILES Table") table:

  ```sql
  mysql> ALTER LOGFILE GROUP lg1
           ADD UNDOFILE 'undofile02.dat'
           INITIAL_SIZE = 4M
           ENGINE = NDB;

  mysql> SELECT DISTINCT
           FILE_NAME AS File,
           FREE_EXTENTS AS Free,
           TOTAL_EXTENTS AS Total,
           EXTENT_SIZE AS Size,
           INITIAL_SIZE AS Initial
           FROM INFORMATION_SCHEMA.FILES;
  +----------------+---------+---------+------+----------+
  | File           | Free    | Total   | Size | Initial  |
  +----------------+---------+---------+------+----------+
  | undofile.dat   |    NULL | 4194304 |    4 | 16777216 |
  | undofile02.dat |    NULL | 1048576 |    4 |  4194304 |
  | NULL           | 5223944 |    NULL |    4 |     NULL |
  +----------------+---------+---------+------+----------+
  ```

  The amount of free space in bytes which is available for
  undo logging by Disk Data tables using this log file group
  can be approximated by multiplying the number of free
  extents by the initial size:

  ```sql
  mysql> SELECT
           FREE_EXTENTS AS 'Free Extents',
           FREE_EXTENTS * EXTENT_SIZE AS 'Free Bytes'
           FROM INFORMATION_SCHEMA.FILES
           WHERE LOGFILE_GROUP_NAME = 'lg1'
           AND FILE_NAME IS NULL;
  +--------------+------------+
  | Free Extents | Free Bytes |
  +--------------+------------+
  |      5223944 |   20895776 |
  +--------------+------------+
  ```

  If you create an NDB Cluster Disk Data table and then insert
  some rows into it, you can see approximately how much space
  remains for undo logging afterward, for example:

  ```sql
  mysql> CREATE TABLESPACE ts1
           ADD DATAFILE 'data1.dat'
           USE LOGFILE GROUP lg1
           INITIAL_SIZE 512M
           ENGINE = NDB;

  mysql> CREATE TABLE dd (
           c1 INT NOT NULL PRIMARY KEY,
           c2 INT,
           c3 DATE
           )
           TABLESPACE ts1 STORAGE DISK
           ENGINE = NDB;

  mysql> INSERT INTO dd VALUES
           (NULL, 1234567890, '2007-02-02'),
           (NULL, 1126789005, '2007-02-03'),
           (NULL, 1357924680, '2007-02-04'),
           (NULL, 1642097531, '2007-02-05');

  mysql> SELECT
           FREE_EXTENTS AS 'Free Extents',
           FREE_EXTENTS * EXTENT_SIZE AS 'Free Bytes'
           FROM INFORMATION_SCHEMA.FILES
           WHERE LOGFILE_GROUP_NAME = 'lg1'
           AND FILE_NAME IS NULL;
  +--------------+------------+
  | Free Extents | Free Bytes |
  +--------------+------------+
  |      5207565 |   20830260 |
  +--------------+------------+
  ```
- Prior to NDB 8.0.13, an additional row was present in the
  [`FILES`](information-schema-files-table.md "28.3.15 The INFORMATION_SCHEMA FILES Table") table for each NDB
  Cluster Disk Data tablespace. Because it did not correspond
  to an actual file, it was removed in NDB 8.0.13. This row
  had `NULL` for the value of the
  `FILE_NAME` column, the value of the
  `FILE_ID` column was always
  `0`, that of the
  `FILE_TYPE` column was always
  `TABLESPACE`, that of the
  `STATUS` column was always
  `NORMAL`, and the value of the
  `ENGINE` column is always
  [`NDBCLUSTER`](mysql-cluster.md "Chapter 25 MySQL NDB Cluster 8.0").

  In NDB 8.0.13 and later, you can obtain information about
  Disk Data tablespaces using the [**ndb\_desc**](mysql-cluster-programs-ndb-desc.md "25.5.9 ndb_desc — Describe NDB Tables")
  utility. For more information, see
  [Section 25.6.11.1, “NDB Cluster Disk Data Objects”](mysql-cluster-disk-data-objects.md "25.6.11.1 NDB Cluster Disk Data Objects"), as well
  as the description of [**ndb\_desc**](mysql-cluster-programs-ndb-desc.md "25.5.9 ndb_desc — Describe NDB Tables").
