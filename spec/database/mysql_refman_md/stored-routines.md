MySQL supports stored routines (procedures and functions). A stored
routine is a set of SQL statements that can be stored in the server.
Once this has been done, clients don't need to keep reissuing the
individual statements but can refer to the stored routine instead.

Stored routines can be particularly useful in certain situations:

- When multiple client applications are written in different
  languages or work on different platforms, but need to perform
  the same database operations.
- When security is paramount. Banks, for example, use stored
  procedures and functions for all common operations. This
  provides a consistent and secure environment, and routines can
  ensure that each operation is properly logged. In such a setup,
  applications and users would have no access to the database
  tables directly, but can only execute specific stored routines.

Stored routines can provide improved performance because less
information needs to be sent between the server and the client. The
tradeoff is that this does increase the load on the database server
because more of the work is done on the server side and less is done
on the client (application) side. Consider this if many client
machines (such as Web servers) are serviced by only one or a few
database servers.

Stored routines also enable you to have libraries of functions in
the database server. This is a feature shared by modern application
languages that enable such design internally (for example, by using
classes). Using these client application language features is
beneficial for the programmer even outside the scope of database
use.

MySQL follows the SQL:2003 syntax for stored routines, which is also
used by IBM's DB2. All syntax described here is supported and any
limitations and extensions are documented where appropriate.
