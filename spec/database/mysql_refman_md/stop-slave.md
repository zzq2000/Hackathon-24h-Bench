Stops the replication threads. From MySQL 8.0.22,
[`STOP SLAVE`](stop-slave.md "15.4.2.9 STOP SLAVE Statement") is deprecated and the
alias [`STOP REPLICA`](stop-replica.md "15.4.2.8 STOP REPLICA Statement") should be used
instead. The statement works in the same way as before, only the
terminology used for the statement and its output has changed.
Both versions of the statement update the same status variables
when used. Please see the documentation for
[`STOP REPLICA`](stop-replica.md "15.4.2.8 STOP REPLICA Statement") for a description of
the statement.
