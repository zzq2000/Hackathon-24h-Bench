#### 25.6.7.3 Adding NDB Cluster Data Nodes Online: Detailed Example

In this section we provide a detailed example illustrating how
to add new NDB Cluster data nodes online, starting with an NDB
Cluster having 2 data nodes in a single node group and
concluding with a cluster having 4 data nodes in 2 node groups.

**Starting configuration.**
For purposes of illustration, we assume a minimal
configuration, and that the cluster uses a
`config.ini` file containing only the
following information:

```ini
[ndbd default]
DataMemory = 100M
IndexMemory = 100M
NoOfReplicas = 2
DataDir = /usr/local/mysql/var/mysql-cluster

[ndbd]
Id = 1
HostName = 198.51.100.1

[ndbd]
Id = 2
HostName = 198.51.100.2

[mgm]
HostName = 198.51.100.10
Id = 10

[api]
Id=20
HostName = 198.51.100.20

[api]
Id=21
HostName = 198.51.100.21
```

Note

We have left a gap in the sequence between data node IDs and
other nodes. This make it easier later to assign node IDs that
are not already in use to data nodes which are newly added.

We also assume that you have already started the cluster using
the appropriate command line or `my.cnf`
options, and that running
[`SHOW`](mysql-cluster-mgm-client-commands.md#ndbclient-show) in the management
client produces output similar to what is shown here:

```ndbmgm
-- NDB Cluster -- Management Client --
ndb_mgm> SHOW
Connected to Management Server at: 198.51.100.10:1186
Cluster Configuration
---------------------
[ndbd(NDB)]     2 node(s)
id=1    @198.51.100.1  (8.0.44-ndb-8.0.44, Nodegroup: 0, *)
id=2    @198.51.100.2  (8.0.44-ndb-8.0.44, Nodegroup: 0)

[ndb_mgmd(MGM)] 1 node(s)
id=10   @198.51.100.10  (8.0.44-ndb-8.0.44)

[mysqld(API)]   2 node(s)
id=20   @198.51.100.20  (8.0.44-ndb-8.0.44)
id=21   @198.51.100.21  (8.0.44-ndb-8.0.44)
```

Finally, we assume that the cluster contains a single
[`NDBCLUSTER`](mysql-cluster.md "Chapter 25 MySQL NDB Cluster 8.0") table created as shown
here:

```sql
USE n;

CREATE TABLE ips (
    id BIGINT NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
    country_code CHAR(2) NOT NULL,
    type CHAR(4) NOT NULL,
    ip_address VARCHAR(15) NOT NULL,
    addresses BIGINT UNSIGNED DEFAULT NULL,
    date BIGINT UNSIGNED DEFAULT NULL
)   ENGINE NDBCLUSTER;
```

The memory usage and related information shown later in this
section was generated after inserting approximately 50000 rows
into this table.

Note

In this example, we show the single-threaded
[**ndbd**](mysql-cluster-programs-ndbd.md "25.5.1 ndbd — The NDB Cluster Data Node Daemon") being used for the data node
processes. You can also apply this example, if you are using
the multithreaded [**ndbmtd**](mysql-cluster-programs-ndbmtd.md "25.5.3 ndbmtd — The NDB Cluster Data Node Daemon (Multi-Threaded)") by substituting
[**ndbmtd**](mysql-cluster-programs-ndbmtd.md "25.5.3 ndbmtd — The NDB Cluster Data Node Daemon (Multi-Threaded)") for [**ndbd**](mysql-cluster-programs-ndbd.md "25.5.1 ndbd — The NDB Cluster Data Node Daemon") wherever
it appears in the steps that follow.

**Step 1: Update configuration file.**
Open the cluster global configuration file in a text editor
and add `[ndbd]` sections corresponding to
the 2 new data nodes. (We give these data nodes IDs 3 and 4,
and assume that they are to be run on host machines at
addresses 198.51.100.3 and 198.51.100.4, respectively.) After
you have added the new sections, the contents of the
`config.ini` file should look like what is
shown here, where the additions to the file are shown in bold
type:

```ini
[ndbd default]
DataMemory = 100M
IndexMemory = 100M
NoOfReplicas = 2
DataDir = /usr/local/mysql/var/mysql-cluster

[ndbd]
Id = 1
HostName = 198.51.100.1

[ndbd]
Id = 2
HostName = 198.51.100.2

[ndbd]
Id = 3
HostName = 198.51.100.3

[ndbd]
Id = 4
HostName = 198.51.100.4

[mgm]
HostName = 198.51.100.10
Id = 10

[api]
Id=20
HostName = 198.51.100.20

[api]
Id=21
HostName = 198.51.100.21
```

Once you have made the necessary changes, save the file.

**Step 2: Restart the management server.**
Restarting the cluster management server requires that you
issue separate commands to stop the management server and then
to start it again, as follows:

1. Stop the management server using the management client
   [`STOP`](mysql-cluster-mgm-client-commands.md#ndbclient-stop) command, as shown
   here:

   ```ndbmgm
   ndb_mgm> 10 STOP
   Node 10 has shut down.
   Disconnecting to allow Management Server to shutdown

   $>
   ```
2. Because shutting down the management server causes the
   management client to terminate, you must start the
   management server from the system shell. For simplicity, we
   assume that `config.ini` is in the same
   directory as the management server binary, but in practice,
   you must supply the correct path to the configuration file.
   You must also supply the
   [`--reload`](mysql-cluster-programs-ndb-mgmd.md#option_ndb_mgmd_reload) or
   [`--initial`](mysql-cluster-programs-ndb-mgmd.md#option_ndb_mgmd_initial) option so that
   the management server reads the new configuration from the
   file rather than its configuration cache. If your
   shell's current directory is also the same as the
   directory where the management server binary is located,
   then you can invoke the management server as shown here:

   ```terminal
   $> ndb_mgmd -f config.ini --reload
   2008-12-08 17:29:23 [MgmSrvr] INFO     -- NDB Cluster Management Server. 8.0.44-ndb-8.0.44
   2008-12-08 17:29:23 [MgmSrvr] INFO     -- Reading cluster configuration from 'config.ini'
   ```

If you check the output of
[`SHOW`](mysql-cluster-mgm-client-commands.md#ndbclient-show) in the management
client after restarting the [**ndb\_mgm**](mysql-cluster-programs-ndb-mgm.md "25.5.5 ndb_mgm — The NDB Cluster Management Client") process,
you should now see something like this:

```ndbmgm
-- NDB Cluster -- Management Client --
ndb_mgm> SHOW
Connected to Management Server at: 198.51.100.10:1186
Cluster Configuration
---------------------
[ndbd(NDB)]     2 node(s)
id=1    @198.51.100.1  (8.0.44-ndb-8.0.44, Nodegroup: 0, *)
id=2    @198.51.100.2  (8.0.44-ndb-8.0.44, Nodegroup: 0)
id=3 (not connected, accepting connect from 198.51.100.3)
id=4 (not connected, accepting connect from 198.51.100.4)

[ndb_mgmd(MGM)] 1 node(s)
id=10   @198.51.100.10  (8.0.44-ndb-8.0.44)

[mysqld(API)]   2 node(s)
id=20   @198.51.100.20  (8.0.44-ndb-8.0.44)
id=21   @198.51.100.21  (8.0.44-ndb-8.0.44)
```

**Step 3: Perform a rolling restart of the existing data nodes.**
This step can be accomplished entirely within the cluster
management client using the
[`RESTART`](mysql-cluster-mgm-client-commands.md#ndbclient-restart) command, as shown
here:

```ndbmgm
ndb_mgm> 1 RESTART
Node 1: Node shutdown initiated
Node 1: Node shutdown completed, restarting, no start.
Node 1 is being restarted

ndb_mgm> Node 1: Start initiated (version 8.0.44)
Node 1: Started (version 8.0.44)

ndb_mgm> 2 RESTART
Node 2: Node shutdown initiated
Node 2: Node shutdown completed, restarting, no start.
Node 2 is being restarted

ndb_mgm> Node 2: Start initiated (version 8.0.44)

ndb_mgm> Node 2: Started (version 8.0.44)
```

Important

After issuing each `X
RESTART` command, wait until the management client
reports `Node X: Started
(version ...)` *before* proceeding
any further.

You can verify that all existing data nodes were restarted using
the updated configuration by checking the
[`ndbinfo.nodes`](mysql-cluster-ndbinfo-nodes.md "25.6.16.47 The ndbinfo nodes Table") table in the
[**mysql**](mysql.md "6.5.1 mysql — The MySQL Command-Line Client") client.

**Step 4: Perform a rolling restart of all cluster API nodes.**
Shut down and restart each MySQL server acting as an SQL node
in the cluster using [**mysqladmin shutdown**](mysqladmin.md "6.5.2 mysqladmin — A MySQL Server Administration Program")
followed by [**mysqld\_safe**](mysqld-safe.md "6.3.2 mysqld_safe — MySQL Server Startup Script") (or another startup
script). This should be similar to what is shown here, where
*`password`* is the MySQL
`root` password for a given MySQL server
instance:

```terminal
$> mysqladmin -uroot -ppassword shutdown
081208 20:19:56 mysqld_safe mysqld from pid file
/usr/local/mysql/var/tonfisk.pid ended
$> mysqld_safe --ndbcluster --ndb-connectstring=198.51.100.10 &
081208 20:20:06 mysqld_safe Logging to '/usr/local/mysql/var/tonfisk.err'.
081208 20:20:06 mysqld_safe Starting mysqld daemon with databases
from /usr/local/mysql/var
```

Of course, the exact input and output depend on how and where
MySQL is installed on the system, as well as which options you
choose to start it (and whether or not some or all of these
options are specified in a `my.cnf` file).

**Step 5: Perform an initial start of the new data nodes.**
From a system shell on each of the hosts for the new data
nodes, start the data nodes as shown here, using the
[`--initial`](mysql-cluster-programs-ndbd.md#option_ndbd_initial) option:

```terminal
$> ndbd -c 198.51.100.10 --initial
```

Note

Unlike the case with restarting the existing data nodes, you
can start the new data nodes concurrently; you do not need to
wait for one to finish starting before starting the other.

*Wait until both of the new data nodes have started
before proceeding with the next step*. Once the new
data nodes have started, you can see in the output of the
management client [`SHOW`](mysql-cluster-mgm-client-commands.md#ndbclient-show)
command that they do not yet belong to any node group (as
indicated with bold type here):

```ndbmgm
ndb_mgm> SHOW
Connected to Management Server at: 198.51.100.10:1186
Cluster Configuration
---------------------
[ndbd(NDB)]     2 node(s)
id=1    @198.51.100.1  (8.0.44-ndb-8.0.44, Nodegroup: 0, *)
id=2    @198.51.100.2  (8.0.44-ndb-8.0.44, Nodegroup: 0)
id=3    @198.51.100.3  (8.0.44-ndb-8.0.44, no nodegroup)
id=4    @198.51.100.4  (8.0.44-ndb-8.0.44, no nodegroup)

[ndb_mgmd(MGM)] 1 node(s)
id=10   @198.51.100.10  (8.0.44-ndb-8.0.44)

[mysqld(API)]   2 node(s)
id=20   @198.51.100.20  (8.0.44-ndb-8.0.44)
id=21   @198.51.100.21  (8.0.44-ndb-8.0.44)
```

**Step 6: Create a new node group.**
You can do this by issuing a [`CREATE
NODEGROUP`](mysql-cluster-mgm-client-commands.md#ndbclient-create-nodegroup) command in the cluster management client.
This command takes as its argument a comma-separated list of
the node IDs of the data nodes to be included in the new node
group, as shown here:

```ndbmgm
ndb_mgm> CREATE NODEGROUP 3,4
Nodegroup 1 created
```

By issuing [`SHOW`](mysql-cluster-mgm-client-commands.md#ndbclient-show) again, you
can verify that data nodes 3 and 4 have joined the new node
group (again indicated in bold type):

```ndbmgm
ndb_mgm> SHOW
Connected to Management Server at: 198.51.100.10:1186
Cluster Configuration
---------------------
[ndbd(NDB)]     2 node(s)
id=1    @198.51.100.1  (8.0.44-ndb-8.0.44, Nodegroup: 0, *)
id=2    @198.51.100.2  (8.0.44-ndb-8.0.44, Nodegroup: 0)
id=3    @198.51.100.3  (8.0.44-ndb-8.0.44, Nodegroup: 1)
id=4    @198.51.100.4  (8.0.44-ndb-8.0.44, Nodegroup: 1)

[ndb_mgmd(MGM)] 1 node(s)
id=10   @198.51.100.10  (8.0.44-ndb-8.0.44)

[mysqld(API)]   2 node(s)
id=20   @198.51.100.20  (8.0.44-ndb-8.0.44)
id=21   @198.51.100.21  (8.0.44-ndb-8.0.44)
```

**Step 7: Redistribute cluster data.**
When a node group is created, existing data and indexes are
not automatically distributed to the new node group's
data nodes, as you can see by issuing the appropriate
[`REPORT`](mysql-cluster-mgm-client-commands.md#ndbclient-report) command in the
management client:

```ndbmgm
ndb_mgm> ALL REPORT MEMORY

Node 1: Data usage is 5%(177 32K pages of total 3200)
Node 1: Index usage is 0%(108 8K pages of total 12832)
Node 2: Data usage is 5%(177 32K pages of total 3200)
Node 2: Index usage is 0%(108 8K pages of total 12832)
Node 3: Data usage is 0%(0 32K pages of total 3200)
Node 3: Index usage is 0%(0 8K pages of total 12832)
Node 4: Data usage is 0%(0 32K pages of total 3200)
Node 4: Index usage is 0%(0 8K pages of total 12832)
```

By using [**ndb\_desc**](mysql-cluster-programs-ndb-desc.md "25.5.9 ndb_desc — Describe NDB Tables") with the
`-p` option, which causes the output to include
partitioning information, you can see that the table still uses
only 2 partitions (in the `Per partition info`
section of the output, shown here in bold text):

```terminal
$> ndb_desc -c 198.51.100.10 -d n ips -p
-- ips --
Version: 1
Fragment type: 9
K Value: 6
Min load factor: 78
Max load factor: 80
Temporary table: no
Number of attributes: 6
Number of primary keys: 1

ip_address Varchar(15;latin1_swedish_ci) NOT NULL AT=SHORT_VAR ST=MEMORY
addresses Bigunsigned NULL AT=FIXED ST=MEMORY
date Bigunsigned NULL AT=FIXED ST=MEMORY

-- Indexes --
PRIMARY KEY(id) - UniqueHashIndex
PRIMARY(id) - OrderedIndex

-- Per partition info --
Partition   Row count   Commit count  Frag fixed memory   Frag varsized memory
0           26086       26086         1572864             557056
1           26329       26329         1605632             557056
```

You can cause the data to be redistributed among all of the data
nodes by performing, for each [`NDB`](mysql-cluster.md "Chapter 25 MySQL NDB Cluster 8.0")
table, an [`ALTER
TABLE ... ALGORITHM=INPLACE, REORGANIZE PARTITION`](alter-table.md "15.1.9 ALTER TABLE Statement")
statement in the [**mysql**](mysql.md "6.5.1 mysql — The MySQL Command-Line Client") client.

Important

`ALTER TABLE ... ALGORITHM=INPLACE, REORGANIZE
PARTITION` does not work on tables that were created
with the `MAX_ROWS` option. Instead, use
`ALTER TABLE ... ALGORITHM=INPLACE,
MAX_ROWS=...` to reorganize such tables.

Keep in mind that using `MAX_ROWS` to set the
number of partitions per table is deprecated, and you should
use `PARTITION_BALANCE` instead; see
[Section 15.1.20.12, “Setting NDB Comment Options”](create-table-ndb-comment-options.md "15.1.20.12 Setting NDB Comment Options"), for more
information.

After issuing the statement `ALTER TABLE ips
ALGORITHM=INPLACE, REORGANIZE PARTITION`, you can see
using [**ndb\_desc**](mysql-cluster-programs-ndb-desc.md "25.5.9 ndb_desc — Describe NDB Tables") that the data for this table
is now stored using 4 partitions, as shown here (with the
relevant portions of the output in bold type):

```terminal
$> ndb_desc -c 198.51.100.10 -d n ips -p
-- ips --
Version: 16777217
Fragment type: 9
K Value: 6
Min load factor: 78
Max load factor: 80

```

Note

Normally, [`ALTER
TABLE table_name
[ALGORITHM=INPLACE,] REORGANIZE PARTITION`](alter-table.md "15.1.9 ALTER TABLE Statement") is used
with a list of partition identifiers and a set of partition
definitions to create a new partitioning scheme for a table
that has already been explicitly partitioned. Its use here to
redistribute data onto a new NDB Cluster node group is an
exception in this regard; when used in this way, no other
keywords or identifiers follow `REORGANIZE
PARTITION`.

For more information, see [Section 15.1.9, “ALTER TABLE Statement”](alter-table.md "15.1.9 ALTER TABLE Statement").

In addition, for each table, the
[`ALTER
TABLE`](alter-table.md "15.1.9 ALTER TABLE Statement") statement should be followed by an
[`OPTIMIZE TABLE`](optimize-table.md "15.7.3.4 OPTIMIZE TABLE Statement") to reclaim wasted
space. You can obtain a list of all
[`NDBCLUSTER`](mysql-cluster.md "Chapter 25 MySQL NDB Cluster 8.0") tables using the
following query against the Information Schema
[`TABLES`](information-schema-tables-table.md "28.3.38 The INFORMATION_SCHEMA TABLES Table") table:

```sql
SELECT TABLE_SCHEMA, TABLE_NAME
    FROM INFORMATION_SCHEMA.TABLES
    WHERE ENGINE = 'NDBCLUSTER';
```

Note

The `INFORMATION_SCHEMA.TABLES.ENGINE` value
for an NDB Cluster table is always
[`NDBCLUSTER`](mysql-cluster.md "Chapter 25 MySQL NDB Cluster 8.0"), regardless of whether
the `CREATE TABLE` statement used to create
the table (or [`ALTER TABLE`](alter-table.md "15.1.9 ALTER TABLE Statement")
statement used to convert an existing table from a different
storage engine) used [`NDB`](mysql-cluster.md "Chapter 25 MySQL NDB Cluster 8.0") or
[`NDBCLUSTER`](mysql-cluster.md "Chapter 25 MySQL NDB Cluster 8.0") in its
`ENGINE` option.

You can see after performing these statements in the output of
[`ALL REPORT MEMORY`](mysql-cluster-mgm-client-commands.md#ndbclient-report) that the
data and indexes are now redistributed between all cluster data
nodes, as shown here:

```ndbmgm
ndb_mgm> ALL REPORT MEMORY

Node 1: Data usage is 5%(176 32K pages of total 3200)
Node 1: Index usage is 0%(76 8K pages of total 12832)
Node 2: Data usage is 5%(176 32K pages of total 3200)
Node 2: Index usage is 0%(76 8K pages of total 12832)
Node 3: Data usage is 2%(80 32K pages of total 3200)
Node 3: Index usage is 0%(51 8K pages of total 12832)
Node 4: Data usage is 2%(80 32K pages of total 3200)
Node 4: Index usage is 0%(50 8K pages of total 12832)
```

Note

Since only one DDL operation on
[`NDBCLUSTER`](mysql-cluster.md "Chapter 25 MySQL NDB Cluster 8.0") tables can be executed
at a time, you must wait for each
[`ALTER TABLE ...
REORGANIZE PARTITION`](alter-table.md "15.1.9 ALTER TABLE Statement") statement to finish before
issuing the next one.

It is not necessary to issue
[`ALTER TABLE ...
REORGANIZE PARTITION`](alter-table.md "15.1.9 ALTER TABLE Statement") statements for
[`NDBCLUSTER`](mysql-cluster.md "Chapter 25 MySQL NDB Cluster 8.0") tables created
*after* the new data nodes have been added;
data added to such tables is distributed among all data nodes
automatically. However, in
[`NDBCLUSTER`](mysql-cluster.md "Chapter 25 MySQL NDB Cluster 8.0") tables that existed
*prior to* the addition of the new nodes,
neither existing nor new data is distributed using the new nodes
until these tables have been reorganized using
[`ALTER TABLE ...
REORGANIZE PARTITION`](alter-table.md "15.1.9 ALTER TABLE Statement").

**Alternative procedure, without rolling restart.**
It is possible to avoid the need for a rolling restart by
configuring the extra data nodes, but not starting them, when
first starting the cluster. We assume, as before, that you
wish to start with two data nodes—nodes 1 and 2—in
one node group and later to expand the cluster to four data
nodes, by adding a second node group consisting of nodes 3 and
4:

```ini
[ndbd default]
DataMemory = 100M
IndexMemory = 100M
NoOfReplicas = 2
DataDir = /usr/local/mysql/var/mysql-cluster

[ndbd]
Id = 1
HostName = 198.51.100.1

[ndbd]
Id = 2
HostName = 198.51.100.2

[ndbd]
Id = 3
HostName = 198.51.100.3
Nodegroup = 65536

[ndbd]
Id = 4
HostName = 198.51.100.4
Nodegroup = 65536

[mgm]
HostName = 198.51.100.10
Id = 10

[api]
Id=20
HostName = 198.51.100.20

[api]
Id=21
HostName = 198.51.100.21
```

The data nodes to be brought online at a later time (nodes 3 and
4) can be configured with
[`NodeGroup = 65536`](mysql-cluster-ndbd-definition.md#ndbparam-ndbd-nodegroup), in
which case nodes 1 and 2 can each be started as shown here:

```terminal
$> ndbd -c 198.51.100.10 --initial
```

The data nodes configured with
[`NodeGroup = 65536`](mysql-cluster-ndbd-definition.md#ndbparam-ndbd-nodegroup) are
treated by the management server as though you had started nodes
1 and 2 using [`--nowait-nodes=3,4`](mysql-cluster-programs-ndbd.md#option_ndbd_nowait-nodes)
after waiting for a period of time determined by the setting for
the
[`StartNoNodeGroupTimeout`](mysql-cluster-ndbd-definition.md#ndbparam-ndbd-startnonodegrouptimeout)
data node configuration parameter. By default, this is 15
seconds (15000 milliseconds).

Note

[`StartNoNodegroupTimeout`](mysql-cluster-ndbd-definition.md#ndbparam-ndbd-startnonodegrouptimeout)
must be the same for all data nodes in the cluster; for this
reason, you should always set it in the `[ndbd
default]` section of the
`config.ini` file, rather than for
individual data nodes.

When you are ready to add the second node group, you need only
perform the following additional steps:

1. Start data nodes 3 and 4, invoking the data node process
   once for each new node:

   ```terminal
   $> ndbd -c 198.51.100.10 --initial
   ```
2. Issue the appropriate [`CREATE
   NODEGROUP`](mysql-cluster-mgm-client-commands.md#ndbclient-create-nodegroup) command in the management client:

   ```ndbmgm
   ndb_mgm> CREATE NODEGROUP 3,4
   ```
3. In the [**mysql**](mysql.md "6.5.1 mysql — The MySQL Command-Line Client") client, issue
   [`ALTER TABLE ...
   REORGANIZE PARTITION`](alter-table.md "15.1.9 ALTER TABLE Statement") and
   [`OPTIMIZE TABLE`](optimize-table.md "15.7.3.4 OPTIMIZE TABLE Statement") statements for
   each existing [`NDBCLUSTER`](mysql-cluster.md "Chapter 25 MySQL NDB Cluster 8.0") table.
   (As noted elsewhere in this section, existing NDB Cluster
   tables cannot use the new nodes for data distribution until
   this has been done.)
