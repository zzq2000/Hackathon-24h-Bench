#### 20.2.1.3 User Credentials For Distributed Recovery

Group Replication uses a distributed recovery process to
synchronize group members when joining them to the group.
Distributed recovery involves transferring transactions from a
donor's binary log to a joining member using a replication
channel named `group_replication_recovery`. You
must therefore set up a replication user with the correct
permissions so that Group Replication can establish direct
member-to-member replication channels. If group members have
been set up to support the use of a remote cloning operation as
part of distributed recovery, which is available in MySQL 8.0.17
and later, this replication user is also used as the clone user
on the donor, and requires the correct permissions for this role
too. For a complete description of distributed recovery, see
[Section 20.5.4, “Distributed Recovery”](group-replication-distributed-recovery.md "20.5.4 Distributed Recovery").

The same replication user must be used for distributed recovery
on every group member. The process of creating the replication
user for distributed recovery can be captured in the binary log,
and then you can rely on distributed recovery to replicate the
statements used to create the user. Alternatively, you can
disable binary logging before creating the replication user, and
then create the user manually on each member, for example if you
want to avoid the changes being propagated to other server
instances. If you do this, ensure you re-enable binary logging
once you have configured the user.

Important

If distributed recovery connections for your group use SSL,
the replication user must be created on each server
*before* the joining member connects to the
donor. For instructions to set up SSL for distributed recovery
connections and create a replication user that requires SSL,
see
[Section 20.6.3, “Securing Distributed Recovery Connections”](group-replication-distributed-recovery-securing.md "20.6.3 Securing Distributed Recovery Connections")

Important

By default, users created in MySQL 8 use
[Section 8.4.1.2, “Caching SHA-2 Pluggable Authentication”](caching-sha2-pluggable-authentication.md "8.4.1.2 Caching SHA-2 Pluggable Authentication"). If
the replication user for distributed recovery uses the caching
SHA-2 authentication plugin, and you are
*not* using SSL for distributed recovery
connections, RSA key-pairs are used for password exchange. You
can either copy the public key of the replication user to the
joining member, or configure the donors to provide the public
key when requested. For instructions to do this, see
[Section 20.6.3.1, “Secure User Credentials for Distributed Recovery”](group-replication-secure-user.md "20.6.3.1 Secure User Credentials for Distributed Recovery").

To create the replication user for distributed recovery, follow
these steps:

1. Start the MySQL server instance, then connect a client to
   it.
2. If you want to disable binary logging in order to create the
   replication user separately on each instance, do so by
   issuing the following statement:

   ```sql
   mysql> SET SQL_LOG_BIN=0;
   ```
3. Create a MySQL user with the following privileges:

   - [`REPLICATION SLAVE`](privileges-provided.md#priv_replication-slave), which
     is required for making a distributed recovery connection
     to a donor to retrieve data.
   - [`CONNECTION_ADMIN`](privileges-provided.md#priv_connection-admin), which
     ensures that Group Replication connections are not
     terminated if one of the servers involved is placed in
     offline mode.
   - [`BACKUP_ADMIN`](privileges-provided.md#priv_backup-admin), if the
     servers in the replication group are set up to support
     cloning (see
     [Section 20.5.4.2, “Cloning for Distributed Recovery”](group-replication-cloning.md "20.5.4.2 Cloning for Distributed Recovery")). This
     privilege is required for a member to act as the donor
     in a cloning operation for distributed recovery.
   - [`GROUP_REPLICATION_STREAM`](privileges-provided.md#priv_group-replication-stream),
     if the MySQL communication stack is in use for the
     replication group (see
     [Section 20.6.1, “Communication Stack for Connection Security Management”](group-replication-connection-security.md "20.6.1 Communication Stack for Connection Security Management")).
     This privilege is required for the user account to be
     able to establish and maintain connections for Group
     Replication using the MySQL communication stack.

   In this example the user *`rpl_user`*
   with the password *`password`* is
   shown. When configuring your servers use a suitable user
   name and password:

   ```sql
   mysql> CREATE USER rpl_user@'%' IDENTIFIED BY 'password';
   mysql> GRANT REPLICATION SLAVE ON *.* TO rpl_user@'%';
   mysql> GRANT CONNECTION_ADMIN ON *.* TO rpl_user@'%';
   mysql> GRANT BACKUP_ADMIN ON *.* TO rpl_user@'%';
   mysql> GRANT GROUP_REPLICATION_STREAM ON *.* TO rpl_user@'%';
   mysql> FLUSH PRIVILEGES;
   ```
4. If you disabled binary logging, enable it again as soon as
   you have created the user, by issuing the following
   statement:

   ```sql
   mysql> SET SQL_LOG_BIN=1;
   ```
5. When you have created the replication user, you must supply
   the user credentials to the server for use with distributed
   recovery. You can do this by setting the user credentials as
   the credentials for the
   `group_replication_recovery` channel, using
   a [`CHANGE REPLICATION SOURCE
   TO`](change-replication-source-to.md "15.4.2.3 CHANGE REPLICATION SOURCE TO Statement") statement (MySQL 8.0.23 or later) or
   [`CHANGE MASTER TO`](change-master-to.md "15.4.2.1 CHANGE MASTER TO Statement") statement
   (prior to MySQL 8.0.23). Alternatively, in MySQL 8.0.21 and
   later, you can specify the user credentials for distributed
   recovery on the [`START
   GROUP_REPLICATION`](start-group-replication.md "15.4.3.1 START GROUP_REPLICATION Statement") statement.

   - User credentials set using [`CHANGE
     REPLICATION SOURCE TO`](change-replication-source-to.md "15.4.2.3 CHANGE REPLICATION SOURCE TO Statement") |
     [`CHANGE MASTER TO`](change-master-to.md "15.4.2.1 CHANGE MASTER TO Statement") are
     stored in plain text in the replication metadata
     repositories on the server. They are applied whenever
     Group Replication is started, including automatic starts
     if the
     [`group_replication_start_on_boot`](group-replication-system-variables.md#sysvar_group_replication_start_on_boot)
     system variable is set to `ON`.
   - User credentials specified on [`START
     GROUP_REPLICATION`](start-group-replication.md "15.4.3.1 START GROUP_REPLICATION Statement") are saved in memory only,
     and are removed by a [`STOP
     GROUP_REPLICATION`](stop-group-replication.md "15.4.3.2 STOP GROUP_REPLICATION Statement") statement or server
     shutdown. You must issue a [`START
     GROUP_REPLICATION`](start-group-replication.md "15.4.3.1 START GROUP_REPLICATION Statement") statement to provide the
     credentials again, so you cannot start Group Replication
     automatically with these credentials. This method of
     specifying the user credentials helps to secure the
     Group Replication servers against unauthorized access.

   For more information on the security implications of each
   method of providing the user credentials, see
   [Section 20.6.3.1.3, “Providing Replication User Credentials Securely”](group-replication-secure-user.md#group-replication-secure-user-provide "20.6.3.1.3 Providing Replication User Credentials Securely"). If
   you choose to provide the user credentials using a
   [`CHANGE REPLICATION SOURCE TO`](change-replication-source-to.md "15.4.2.3 CHANGE REPLICATION SOURCE TO Statement")
   | [`CHANGE MASTER TO`](change-master-to.md "15.4.2.1 CHANGE MASTER TO Statement") statement,
   issue the following statement on the server instance now,
   replacing *`rpl_user`* and
   *`password`* with the values used
   when creating the user:

   ```sql
   mysql> CHANGE MASTER TO MASTER_USER='rpl_user', MASTER_PASSWORD='password' \\
   		      FOR CHANNEL 'group_replication_recovery';
   ```

   Or in MySQL 8.0.23 or later:

   ```sql
   mysql> CHANGE REPLICATION SOURCE TO SOURCE_USER='rpl_user', SOURCE_PASSWORD='password' \\
   		      FOR CHANNEL 'group_replication_recovery';
   ```
