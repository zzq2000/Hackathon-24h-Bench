## 14.14 Locking Functions

This section describes functions used to manipulate user-level
locks.

**Table 14.19 Locking Functions**

| Name | Description |
| --- | --- |
| [`GET_LOCK()`](locking-functions.md#function_get-lock) | Get a named lock |
| [`IS_FREE_LOCK()`](locking-functions.md#function_is-free-lock) | Whether the named lock is free |
| [`IS_USED_LOCK()`](locking-functions.md#function_is-used-lock) | Whether the named lock is in use; return connection identifier if true |
| [`RELEASE_ALL_LOCKS()`](locking-functions.md#function_release-all-locks) | Release all current named locks |
| [`RELEASE_LOCK()`](locking-functions.md#function_release-lock) | Release the named lock |

- [`GET_LOCK(str,timeout)`](locking-functions.md#function_get-lock)

  Tries to obtain a lock with a name given by the string
  *`str`*, using a timeout of
  *`timeout`* seconds. A negative
  *`timeout`* value means infinite
  timeout. The lock is exclusive. While held by one session,
  other sessions cannot obtain a lock of the same name.

  Returns `1` if the lock was obtained
  successfully, `0` if the attempt timed out
  (for example, because another client has previously locked the
  name), or `NULL` if an error occurred (such
  as running out of memory or the thread was killed with
  [**mysqladmin kill**](mysqladmin.md "6.5.2 mysqladmin — A MySQL Server Administration Program")).

  A lock obtained with [`GET_LOCK()`](locking-functions.md#function_get-lock)
  is released explicitly by executing
  [`RELEASE_LOCK()`](locking-functions.md#function_release-lock) or implicitly
  when your session terminates (either normally or abnormally).
  Locks obtained with [`GET_LOCK()`](locking-functions.md#function_get-lock)
  are not released when transactions commit or roll back.

  [`GET_LOCK()`](locking-functions.md#function_get-lock) is implemented using
  the metadata locking (MDL) subsystem. Multiple simultaneous
  locks can be acquired and
  [`GET_LOCK()`](locking-functions.md#function_get-lock) does not release any
  existing locks. For example, suppose that you execute these
  statements:

  ```sql
  SELECT GET_LOCK('lock1',10);
  SELECT GET_LOCK('lock2',10);
  SELECT RELEASE_LOCK('lock2');
  SELECT RELEASE_LOCK('lock1');
  ```

  The second [`GET_LOCK()`](locking-functions.md#function_get-lock) acquires
  a second lock and both
  [`RELEASE_LOCK()`](locking-functions.md#function_release-lock) calls return 1
  (success).

  It is even possible for a given session to acquire multiple
  locks for the same name. Other sessions cannot acquire a lock
  with that name until the acquiring session releases all its
  locks for the name.

  Uniquely named locks acquired with
  [`GET_LOCK()`](locking-functions.md#function_get-lock) appear in the
  Performance Schema [`metadata_locks`](performance-schema-metadata-locks-table.md "29.12.13.3 The metadata_locks Table")
  table. The `OBJECT_TYPE` column says
  `USER LEVEL LOCK` and the
  `OBJECT_NAME` column indicates the lock name.
  In the case that multiple locks are acquired for the
  *same* name, only the first lock for the
  name registers a row in the
  [`metadata_locks`](performance-schema-metadata-locks-table.md "29.12.13.3 The metadata_locks Table") table. Subsequent
  locks for the name increment a counter in the lock but do not
  acquire additional metadata locks. The
  [`metadata_locks`](performance-schema-metadata-locks-table.md "29.12.13.3 The metadata_locks Table") row for the lock
  is deleted when the last lock instance on the name is
  released.

  The capability of acquiring multiple locks means there is the
  possibility of deadlock among clients. When this happens, the
  server chooses a caller and terminates its lock-acquisition
  request with an
  [`ER_USER_LOCK_DEADLOCK`](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/mysql-errors/8.0/en/server-error-reference.html#error_er_user_lock_deadlock) error.
  This error does not cause transactions to roll back.

  MySQL enforces a maximum length on lock names of 64
  characters.

  [`GET_LOCK()`](locking-functions.md#function_get-lock) can be used to
  implement application locks or to simulate record locks. Names
  are locked on a server-wide basis. If a name has been locked
  within one session, [`GET_LOCK()`](locking-functions.md#function_get-lock)
  blocks any request by another session for a lock with the same
  name. This enables clients that agree on a given lock name to
  use the name to perform cooperative advisory locking. But be
  aware that it also enables a client that is not among the set
  of cooperating clients to lock a name, either inadvertently or
  deliberately, and thus prevent any of the cooperating clients
  from locking that name. One way to reduce the likelihood of
  this is to use lock names that are database-specific or
  application-specific. For example, use lock names of the form
  *`db_name.str`* or
  *`app_name.str`*.

  If multiple clients are waiting for a lock, the order in which
  they acquire it is undefined. Applications should not assume
  that clients acquire the lock in the same order that they
  issued the lock requests.

  [`GET_LOCK()`](locking-functions.md#function_get-lock) is unsafe for
  statement-based replication. A warning is logged if you use
  this function when
  [`binlog_format`](replication-options-binary-log.md#sysvar_binlog_format) is set to
  `STATEMENT`.

  Since `GET_LOCK()` establishes a lock only on
  a single [**mysqld**](mysqld.md "6.3.1 mysqld — The MySQL Server"), it is not suitable for use
  with NDB Cluster, which has no way of enforcing an SQL lock
  across multiple MySQL servers. See
  [Section 25.2.7.10, “Limitations Relating to Multiple NDB Cluster Nodes”](mysql-cluster-limitations-multiple-nodes.md "25.2.7.10 Limitations Relating to Multiple NDB Cluster Nodes"),
  for more information.

  Caution

  With the capability of acquiring multiple named locks, it is
  possible for a single statement to acquire a large number of
  locks. For example:

  ```sql
  INSERT INTO ... SELECT GET_LOCK(t1.col_name) FROM t1;
  ```

  These types of statements may have certain adverse effects.
  For example, if the statement fails part way through and
  rolls back, locks acquired up to the point of failure still
  exist. If the intent is for there to be a correspondence
  between rows inserted and locks acquired, that intent is not
  satisfied. Also, if it is important that locks are granted
  in a certain order, be aware that result set order may
  differ depending on which execution plan the optimizer
  chooses. For these reasons, it may be best to limit
  applications to a single lock-acquisition call per
  statement.

  A different locking interface is available as either a plugin
  service or a set of loadable functions. This interface
  provides lock namespaces and distinct read and write locks,
  unlike the interface provided by
  [`GET_LOCK()`](locking-functions.md#function_get-lock) and related
  functions. For details, see [Section 7.6.9.1, “The Locking Service”](locking-service.md "7.6.9.1 The Locking Service").
- [`IS_FREE_LOCK(str)`](locking-functions.md#function_is-free-lock)

  Checks whether the lock named *`str`*
  is free to use (that is, not locked). Returns
  `1` if the lock is free (no one is using the
  lock), `0` if the lock is in use, and
  `NULL` if an error occurs (such as an
  incorrect argument).

  This function is unsafe for statement-based replication. A
  warning is logged if you use this function when
  [`binlog_format`](replication-options-binary-log.md#sysvar_binlog_format) is set to
  `STATEMENT`.
- [`IS_USED_LOCK(str)`](locking-functions.md#function_is-used-lock)

  Checks whether the lock named *`str`*
  is in use (that is, locked). If so, it returns the connection
  identifier of the client session that holds the lock.
  Otherwise, it returns `NULL`.

  This function is unsafe for statement-based replication. A
  warning is logged if you use this function when
  [`binlog_format`](replication-options-binary-log.md#sysvar_binlog_format) is set to
  `STATEMENT`.
- [`RELEASE_ALL_LOCKS()`](locking-functions.md#function_release-all-locks)

  Releases all named locks held by the current session and
  returns the number of locks released (0 if there were none)

  This function is unsafe for statement-based replication. A
  warning is logged if you use this function when
  [`binlog_format`](replication-options-binary-log.md#sysvar_binlog_format) is set to
  `STATEMENT`.
- [`RELEASE_LOCK(str)`](locking-functions.md#function_release-lock)

  Releases the lock named by the string
  *`str`* that was obtained with
  [`GET_LOCK()`](locking-functions.md#function_get-lock). Returns
  `1` if the lock was released,
  `0` if the lock was not established by this
  thread (in which case the lock is not released), and
  `NULL` if the named lock did not exist. The
  lock does not exist if it was never obtained by a call to
  [`GET_LOCK()`](locking-functions.md#function_get-lock) or if it has
  previously been released.

  The [`DO`](do.md "15.2.3 DO Statement") statement is convenient
  to use with [`RELEASE_LOCK()`](locking-functions.md#function_release-lock). See
  [Section 15.2.3, “DO Statement”](do.md "15.2.3 DO Statement").

  This function is unsafe for statement-based replication. A
  warning is logged if you use this function when
  [`binlog_format`](replication-options-binary-log.md#sysvar_binlog_format) is set to
  `STATEMENT`.
