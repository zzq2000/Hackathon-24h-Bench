### 12.9.2 The utf8mb3 Character Set (3-Byte UTF-8 Unicode Encoding)

The `utf8mb3` character set has these
characteristics:

- Supports BMP characters only (no support for supplementary
  characters)
- Requires a maximum of three bytes per multibyte character.

Applications that use UTF-8 data but require supplementary
character support should use `utf8mb4` rather
than `utf8mb3` (see
[Section 12.9.1, “The utf8mb4 Character Set (4-Byte UTF-8 Unicode Encoding)”](charset-unicode-utf8mb4.md "12.9.1 The utf8mb4 Character Set (4-Byte UTF-8 Unicode Encoding)")).

Exactly the same set of characters is available in
`utf8mb3` and `ucs2`. That is,
they have the same
[repertoire](glossary.md#glos_repertoire "repertoire").

Note

The recommended character set for MySQL is
`utf8mb4`. All new applications should use
`utf8mb4`.

The `utf8mb3` character set is deprecated.
`utf8mb3` remains supported for the lifetimes
of the MySQL 8.0.x and following LTS release series, as well
as in MySQL 8.0.

Expect `utf8mb3` to be removed in a future
major release of MySQL.

Since changing character sets can be a complex and
time-consuming task, you should begin to prepare for this
change now by using `utf8mb4` for new
applications. For guidance in converting existing applications
which use utfmb3, see
[Section 12.9.8, “Converting Between 3-Byte and 4-Byte Unicode Character Sets”](charset-unicode-conversion.md "12.9.8 Converting Between 3-Byte and 4-Byte Unicode Character Sets").

`utf8mb3` can be used in `CHARACTER
SET` clauses, and
`utf8mb3_collation_substring`
in `COLLATE` clauses, where
*`collation_substring`* is
`bin`, `czech_ci`,
`danish_ci`, `esperanto_ci`,
`estonian_ci`, and so forth. For example:

```sql
CREATE TABLE t (s1 CHAR(1)) CHARACTER SET utf8mb3;
SELECT * FROM t WHERE s1 COLLATE utf8mb3_general_ci = 'x';
DECLARE x VARCHAR(5) CHARACTER SET utf8mb3 COLLATE utf8mb3_danish_ci;
SELECT CAST('a' AS CHAR CHARACTER SET utf8mb4) COLLATE utf8mb4_czech_ci;
```

Prior to MySQL 8.0.29, instances of `utf8mb3`
in statements were converted to `utf8`. In
MySQL 8.0.30 and later, the reverse is true, so that in
statements such as `SHOW CREATE TABLE` or
`SELECT CHARACTER_SET_NAME FROM
INFORMATION_SCHEMA.COLUMNS` or `SELECT
COLLATION_NAME FROM INFORMATION_SCHEMA.COLUMNS`, users
see the character set or collation name prefixed with
`utf8mb3` or `utf8mb3_`.

`utf8mb3` is also valid (but deprecated) in
contexts other than `CHARACTER SET` clauses.
For example:

```terminal
mysqld --character-set-server=utf8mb3
```

```sql
SET NAMES 'utf8mb3'; /* and other SET statements that have similar effect */
SELECT _utf8mb3 'a';
```
