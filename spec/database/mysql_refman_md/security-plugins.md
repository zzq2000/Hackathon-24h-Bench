MySQL includes several components and plugins that implement
security features:

- Plugins for authenticating attempts by clients to connect to
  MySQL Server. Plugins are available for several authentication
  protocols. For general discussion of the authentication process,
  see [Section 8.2.17, “Pluggable Authentication”](pluggable-authentication.md "8.2.17 Pluggable Authentication"). For
  characteristics of specific authentication plugins, see
  [Section 8.4.1, “Authentication Plugins”](authentication-plugins.md "8.4.1 Authentication Plugins").
- A password-validation component for implementing password
  strength policies and assessing the strength of potential
  passwords. See [Section 8.4.3, “The Password Validation Component”](validate-password.md "8.4.3 The Password Validation Component").
- Keyring plugins that provide secure storage for sensitive
  information. See [Section 8.4.4, “The MySQL Keyring”](keyring.md "8.4.4 The MySQL Keyring").
- (MySQL Enterprise Edition only) MySQL Enterprise Audit, implemented using a server plugin, uses
  the open MySQL Audit API to enable standard, policy-based
  monitoring and logging of connection and query activity executed
  on specific MySQL servers. Designed to meet the Oracle audit
  specification, MySQL Enterprise Audit provides an out of box, easy to use
  auditing and compliance solution for applications that are
  governed by both internal and external regulatory guidelines.
  See [Section 8.4.5, “MySQL Enterprise Audit”](audit-log.md "8.4.5 MySQL Enterprise Audit").
- A function enables applications to add their own message events
  to the audit log. See [Section 8.4.6, “The Audit Message Component”](audit-api-message-emit.md "8.4.6 The Audit Message Component").
- (MySQL Enterprise Edition only) MySQL Enterprise Firewall, an application-level firewall that enables
  database administrators to permit or deny SQL statement
  execution based on matching against lists of accepted statement
  patterns. This helps harden MySQL Server against attacks such as
  SQL injection or attempts to exploit applications by using them
  outside of their legitimate query workload characteristics. See
  [Section 8.4.7, “MySQL Enterprise Firewall”](firewall.md "8.4.7 MySQL Enterprise Firewall").
- (MySQL Enterprise Edition only) MySQL Enterprise Data Masking and De-Identification, implemented as a plugin library
  containing a plugin and a set of functions. Data masking hides
  sensitive information by replacing real values with substitutes.
  MySQL Enterprise Data Masking and De-Identification functions enable masking existing data using several
  methods such as obfuscation (removing identifying
  characteristics), generation of formatted random data, and data
  replacement or substitution. See [Section 8.5, “MySQL Enterprise Data Masking and De-Identification”](data-masking.md "8.5 MySQL Enterprise Data Masking and De-Identification").
