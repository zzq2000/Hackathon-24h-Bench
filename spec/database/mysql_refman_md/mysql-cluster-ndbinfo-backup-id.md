#### 25.6.16.3 The ndbinfo backup\_id Table

This table provides a way to find the ID of the backup started
most recently for this cluster.

The `backup_id` table contains a single column
`id`, which corresponds to a backup ID taken
using the [**ndb\_mgm**](mysql-cluster-programs-ndb-mgm.md "25.5.5 ndb_mgm — The NDB Cluster Management Client") client
[`START BACKUP`](mysql-cluster-backup-using-management-client.md "25.6.8.2 Using The NDB Cluster Management Client to Create a Backup") command. This
table contains a single row.

*Example*: Assume the following sequence of
`START BACKUP` commands issued in the NDB
management client, with no other backups taken since the cluster
was first started:

```ndbmgm
ndb_mgm> START BACKUP
Waiting for completed, this may take several minutes
Node 5: Backup 1 started from node 50
Node 5: Backup 1 started from node 50 completed
 StartGCP: 27894 StopGCP: 27897
 #Records: 2057 #LogRecords: 0
 Data: 51580 bytes Log: 0 bytes
ndb_mgm> START BACKUP 5
Waiting for completed, this may take several minutes
Node 5: Backup 5 started from node 50
Node 5: Backup 5 started from node 50 completed
 StartGCP: 27905 StopGCP: 27908
 #Records: 2057 #LogRecords: 0
 Data: 51580 bytes Log: 0 bytes
ndb_mgm> START BACKUP
Waiting for completed, this may take several minutes
Node 5: Backup 6 started from node 50
Node 5: Backup 6 started from node 50 completed
 StartGCP: 27912 StopGCP: 27915
 #Records: 2057 #LogRecords: 0
 Data: 51580 bytes Log: 0 bytes
ndb_mgm> START BACKUP 3
Connected to Management Server at: localhost:1186
Waiting for completed, this may take several minutes
Node 5: Backup 3 started from node 50
Node 5: Backup 3 started from node 50 completed
 StartGCP: 28149 StopGCP: 28152
 #Records: 2057 #LogRecords: 0
 Data: 51580 bytes Log: 0 bytes
ndb_mgm>
```

After this, the `backup_id` table contains the
single row shown here, using the [**mysql**](mysql.md "6.5.1 mysql — The MySQL Command-Line Client")
client:

```sql
mysql> USE ndbinfo;

Database changed
mysql> SELECT * FROM backup_id;
+------+
| id   |
+------+
|    3 |
+------+
1 row in set (0.00 sec)
```

If no backups can be found, the table contains a single row with
`0` as the `id` value.

The `backup_id` table was added in NDB 8.0.24.
