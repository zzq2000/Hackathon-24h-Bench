## 2.7 Installing MySQL on Solaris

[2.7.1 Installing MySQL on Solaris Using a Solaris PKG](solaris-installation-pkg.md)

Note

MySQL 8.0 supports Solaris 11.4 and higher

MySQL on Solaris is available in a number of different formats.

- For information on installing using the native Solaris PKG
  format, see [Section 2.7.1, “Installing MySQL on Solaris Using a Solaris PKG”](solaris-installation-pkg.md "2.7.1 Installing MySQL on Solaris Using a Solaris PKG").
- To use a standard `tar` binary installation,
  use the notes provided in [Section 2.2, “Installing MySQL on Unix/Linux Using Generic Binaries”](binary-installation.md "2.2 Installing MySQL on Unix/Linux Using Generic Binaries").
  Check the notes and hints at the end of this section for Solaris
  specific notes that you may need before or after installation.

Note

MySQL 5.7 has a dependency on the Oracle Developer Studio Runtime
Libraries; but this does not apply to MySQL 8.0.

To obtain a binary MySQL distribution for Solaris in tarball or PKG
format,
<https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/mysql/8.0.html>.

Additional notes to be aware of when installing and using MySQL on
Solaris:

- If you want to use MySQL with the `mysql` user
  and group, use the **groupadd** and
  **useradd** commands:

  ```terminal
  groupadd mysql
  useradd -g mysql -s /bin/false mysql
  ```
- If you install MySQL using a binary tarball distribution on
  Solaris, because the Solaris **tar** cannot
  handle long file names, use GNU **tar**
  (**gtar**) to unpack the distribution. If you do
  not have GNU **tar** on your system, install it
  with the following command:

  ```terminal
  pkg install archiver/gnu-tar
  ```
- You should mount any file systems on which you intend to store
  `InnoDB` files with the
  `forcedirectio` option. (By default mounting is
  done without this option.) Failing to do so causes a significant
  drop in performance when using the `InnoDB`
  storage engine on this platform.
- If you would like MySQL to start automatically, you can copy
  `support-files/mysql.server` to
  `/etc/init.d` and create a symbolic link to
  it named `/etc/rc3.d/S99mysql.server`.
- If too many processes try to connect very rapidly to
  [**mysqld**](mysqld.md "6.3.1 mysqld — The MySQL Server"), you should see this error in the
  MySQL log:

  ```simple
  Error in accept: Protocol error
  ```

  You might try starting the server with the
  [`--back_log=50`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_back_log) option as a
  workaround for this.
- To configure the generation of core files on Solaris you should
  use the **coreadm** command. Because of the
  security implications of generating a core on a
  `setuid()` application, by default, Solaris
  does not support core files on `setuid()`
  programs. However, you can modify this behavior using
  **coreadm**. If you enable
  `setuid()` core files for the current user,
  they are generated using mode 600 and are owned by the
  superuser.
