### 25.5.13 ndb\_import — Import CSV Data Into NDB

[**ndb\_import**](mysql-cluster-programs-ndb-import.md "25.5.13 ndb_import — Import CSV Data Into NDB") imports CSV-formatted data, such
as that produced by [**mysqldump**](mysqldump.md "6.5.4 mysqldump — A Database Backup Program")
[`--tab`](mysqldump.md#option_mysqldump_tab), directly into
`NDB` using the NDB API.
[**ndb\_import**](mysql-cluster-programs-ndb-import.md "25.5.13 ndb_import — Import CSV Data Into NDB") requires a connection to an NDB
management server ([**ndb\_mgmd**](mysql-cluster-programs-ndb-mgmd.md "25.5.4 ndb_mgmd — The NDB Cluster Management Server Daemon")) to function; it
does not require a connection to a MySQL Server.

#### Usage

```terminal
ndb_import db_name file_name options
```

[**ndb\_import**](mysql-cluster-programs-ndb-import.md "25.5.13 ndb_import — Import CSV Data Into NDB") requires two arguments.
*`db_name`* is the name of the database
where the table into which to import the data is found;
*`file_name`* is the name of the CSV file
from which to read the data; this must include the path to this
file if it is not in the current directory. The name of the file
must match that of the table; the file's extension, if any,
is not taken into consideration. Options supported by
[**ndb\_import**](mysql-cluster-programs-ndb-import.md "25.5.13 ndb_import — Import CSV Data Into NDB") include those for specifying field
separators, escapes, and line terminators, and are described
later in this section.

Prior to NDB 8.0.30, [**ndb\_import**](mysql-cluster-programs-ndb-import.md "25.5.13 ndb_import — Import CSV Data Into NDB") rejects any
empty lines which it reads from the CSV file. Beginning with NDB
8.0.30, when importing a single column, an empty value that can
be used as the column value, ndb\_import handles it in the same
manner as a [`LOAD DATA`](load-data.md "15.2.9 LOAD DATA Statement") statement
does.

[**ndb\_import**](mysql-cluster-programs-ndb-import.md "25.5.13 ndb_import — Import CSV Data Into NDB") must be able to connect to an NDB
Cluster management server; for this reason, there must be an
unused `[api]` slot in the cluster
`config.ini` file.

To duplicate an existing table that uses a different storage
engine, such as [`InnoDB`](innodb-storage-engine.md "Chapter 17 The InnoDB Storage Engine"), as an
`NDB` table, use the [**mysql**](mysql.md "6.5.1 mysql — The MySQL Command-Line Client")
client to perform a
[`SELECT INTO
OUTFILE`](select-into.md "15.2.13.1 SELECT ... INTO Statement") statement to export the existing table to a
CSV file, then to execute a
[`CREATE TABLE
LIKE`](create-table-like.md "15.1.20.3 CREATE TABLE ... LIKE Statement") statement to create a new table having the same
structure as the existing table, then perform
[`ALTER TABLE ...
ENGINE=NDB`](alter-table.md "15.1.9 ALTER TABLE Statement") on the new table; after this, from the
system shell, invoke [**ndb\_import**](mysql-cluster-programs-ndb-import.md "25.5.13 ndb_import — Import CSV Data Into NDB") to load the
data into the new `NDB` table. For example, an
existing `InnoDB` table named
`myinnodb_table` in a database named
`myinnodb` can be exported into an
`NDB` table named
`myndb_table` in a database named
`myndb` as shown here, assuming that you are
already logged in as a MySQL user with the appropriate
privileges:

1. In the [**mysql**](mysql.md "6.5.1 mysql — The MySQL Command-Line Client") client:

   ```sql
   mysql> USE myinnodb;

   mysql> SELECT * INTO OUTFILE '/tmp/myndb_table.csv'
        >  FIELDS TERMINATED BY ',' OPTIONALLY ENCLOSED BY '"' ESCAPED BY '\\'
        >  LINES TERMINATED BY '\n'
        >  FROM myinnodbtable;

   mysql> CREATE DATABASE myndb;

   mysql> USE myndb;

   mysql> CREATE TABLE myndb_table LIKE myinnodb.myinnodb_table;

   mysql> ALTER TABLE myndb_table ENGINE=NDB;

   mysql> EXIT;
   Bye
   $>
   ```

   Once the target database and table have been created, a
   running [**mysqld**](mysqld.md "6.3.1 mysqld — The MySQL Server") is no longer required. You
   can stop it using [**mysqladmin shutdown**](mysqladmin.md "6.5.2 mysqladmin — A MySQL Server Administration Program") or
   another method before proceeding, if you wish.
2. In the system shell:

   ```terminal
   # if you are not already in the MySQL bin directory:
   $> cd path-to-mysql-bin-dir

   $> ndb_import myndb /tmp/myndb_table.csv --fields-optionally-enclosed-by='"' \
       --fields-terminated-by="," --fields-escaped-by='\\'
   ```

   The output should resemble what is shown here:

   ```terminal
   job-1 import myndb.myndb_table from /tmp/myndb_table.csv
   job-1 [running] import myndb.myndb_table from /tmp/myndb_table.csv
   job-1 [success] import myndb.myndb_table from /tmp/myndb_table.csv
   job-1 imported 19984 rows in 0h0m9s at 2277 rows/s
   jobs summary: defined: 1 run: 1 with success: 1 with failure: 0
   $>
   ```

  | --- | --- |
  | Command-Line Format | `--csvopt=opts` |
  | Type | String |
  | Default Value | `[none]` |

  Provides a shortcut method for setting typical CSV import
  options. The argument to this option is a string consisting
  of one or more of the following parameters:

  - `c`: Fields terminated by comma
  - `d`: Use defaults, except where
    overridden by another parameter
  - `n`: Lines terminated by
    `\n`
  - `q`: Fields optionally enclosed by
    double quote characters (`"`)
  - `r`: Line terminated by
    `\r`

  In NDB 8.0.28 and later, the order of parameters used in the
  argument to this option is handled such that the rightmost
  parameter always takes precedence over any potentially
  conflicting parameters which have already been used in the
  same argument value. This also applies to any duplicate
  instances of a given parameter. Prior to NDB 8.0.28, the
  order of the parameters made no difference, other than that,
  when both `n` and `r` were
  specified, the one occurring last (rightmost) was the
  parameter which actually took effect.

  This option is intended for use in testing under conditions
  in which it is difficult to transmit escapes or quotation
  marks.

  | Type | Enumeration |
  | Default Value | `[none]` |
  | Valid Values | `stopjob`  `stopall`  `sighup`  `sigint`  `list` |

  Error insert type; use `list` as the
  *`name`* value to obtain all possible
  values. This option is used for testing purposes only.

  This works in the same way as the `FIELDS ENCLOSED
  BY` option does for the [`LOAD

  interpreted as quoting field values. For CSV input, this is
  the same as
  [`--fields-optionally-enclosed-by`](mysql-cluster-programs-ndb-import.md#option_ndb_import_fields-optionally-enclosed-by).

  ENCLOSED BY` option does for the
  [`LOAD DATA`](load-data.md "15.2.9 LOAD DATA Statement") statement,
  specifying a character to be interpreted as optionally
  quoting field values. For CSV input, this is the same as
  [`--fields-enclosed-by`](mysql-cluster-programs-ndb-import.md#option_ndb_import_fields-enclosed-by).

  | Minimum Value | `0` |
  | Maximum Value | `4294967295` |

  Cause ndb\_import to ignore the first
  *`#`* lines of the input file. This
  can be employed to skip a file header that does not contain
  any data.

  By default, ndb\_import removes all state files (except
  non-empty `*.rej` files) when it
  completes a job. Specify this option (nor argument is
  required) to force the program to retain all state files
  instead.
- [`--lines-terminated-by`](mysql-cluster-programs-ndb-import.md#option_ndb_import_lines-terminated-by)=*`name`*

  |  |  |
  | --- | --- |
  | Command-Line Format | `--lines-terminated-by=char` |
  | Type | String |
  | Default Value | `\n` |

  This works in the same way as the `LINES TERMINATED
  BY` option does for the [`LOAD
  DATA`](load-data.md "15.2.9 LOAD DATA Statement") statement, specifying a character to be

  | Default Value | `[input file base name]` |

  By default, [**ndb\_import**](mysql-cluster-programs-ndb-import.md "25.5.13 ndb_import — Import CSV Data Into NDB") attempts to import
  data into a table whose name is the base name of the CSV
  file from which the data is being read. Beginning with NDB

  `-v`

  |  |  |
  | --- | --- |

As with [`LOAD DATA`](load-data.md "15.2.9 LOAD DATA Statement"), options for
field and line formatting much match those used to create the
CSV file, whether this was done using
[`SELECT INTO ...
OUTFILE`](select-into.md "15.2.13.1 SELECT ... INTO Statement"), or by some other means. There is no
equivalent to the [`LOAD DATA`](load-data.md "15.2.9 LOAD DATA Statement")
statement `STARTING WITH` option.
