### 8.2.13 When Privilege Changes Take Effect

If the [**mysqld**](mysqld.md "6.3.1 mysqld — The MySQL Server") server is started without the
[`--skip-grant-tables`](server-options.md#option_mysqld_skip-grant-tables) option, it
reads all grant table contents into memory during its startup
sequence. The in-memory tables become effective for access control
at that point.

If you modify the grant tables indirectly using an
account-management statement, the server notices these changes and
loads the grant tables into memory again immediately.
Account-management statements are described in
[Section 15.7.1, “Account Management Statements”](account-management-statements.md "15.7.1 Account Management Statements"). Examples include
[`GRANT`](grant.md "15.7.1.6 GRANT Statement"),
[`REVOKE`](revoke.md "15.7.1.8 REVOKE Statement"), [`SET
PASSWORD`](set-password.md "15.7.1.10 SET PASSWORD Statement"), and [`RENAME
USER`](rename-user.md "15.7.1.7 RENAME USER Statement").

If you modify the grant tables directly using statements such as
[`INSERT`](insert.md "15.2.7 INSERT Statement"),
[`UPDATE`](update.md "15.2.17 UPDATE Statement"), or
[`DELETE`](delete.md "15.2.2 DELETE Statement") (which is not recommended),
the changes have no effect on privilege checking until you either
tell the server to reload the tables or restart it. Thus, if you
change the grant tables directly but forget to reload them, the
changes have *no effect* until you restart the
server. This may leave you wondering why your changes seem to make
no difference!

To tell the server to reload the grant tables, perform a
flush-privileges operation. This can be done by issuing a
[`FLUSH PRIVILEGES`](flush.md#flush-privileges) statement or by
executing a [**mysqladmin flush-privileges**](mysqladmin.md "6.5.2 mysqladmin — A MySQL Server Administration Program") or
[**mysqladmin reload**](mysqladmin.md "6.5.2 mysqladmin — A MySQL Server Administration Program") command.

A grant table reload affects privileges for each existing client
session as follows:

- Table and column privilege changes take effect with the
  client's next request.
- Database privilege changes take effect the next time the
  client executes a `USE
  db_name` statement.

  Note

  Client applications may cache the database name; thus, this
  effect may not be visible to them without actually changing
  to a different database.
- Static global privileges and passwords are unaffected for a
  connected client. These changes take effect only in sessions
  for subsequent connections. Changes to dynamic global
  privileges apply immediately. For information about the
  differences between static and dynamic privileges, see
  [Static Versus Dynamic Privileges](privileges-provided.md#static-dynamic-privileges "Static Versus Dynamic Privileges").)

Changes to the set of active roles within a session take effect
immediately, for that session only. The [`SET
ROLE`](set-role.md "15.7.1.11 SET ROLE Statement") statement performs session role activation and
deactivation (see [Section 15.7.1.11, “SET ROLE Statement”](set-role.md "15.7.1.11 SET ROLE Statement")).

If the server is started with the
[`--skip-grant-tables`](server-options.md#option_mysqld_skip-grant-tables) option, it does
not read the grant tables or implement any access control. Any
user can connect and perform any operation, *which is
insecure.* To cause a server thus started to read the
tables and enable access checking, flush the privileges.
