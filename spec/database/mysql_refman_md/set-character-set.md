#### 15.7.6.2 SET CHARACTER SET Statement

```sql
SET {CHARACTER SET | CHARSET}
    {'charset_name' | DEFAULT}
```

This statement maps all strings sent between the server and the
current client with the given mapping. `SET CHARACTER
SET` sets three session system variables:
[`character_set_client`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_character_set_client) and
[`character_set_results`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_character_set_results) are set
to the given character set, and
[`character_set_connection`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_character_set_connection) to the
value of
[`character_set_database`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_character_set_database). See
[Section 12.4, “Connection Character Sets and Collations”](charset-connection.md "12.4 Connection Character Sets and Collations").

*`charset_name`* may be quoted or
unquoted.

The default character set mapping can be restored by using the
value `DEFAULT`. The default depends on the
server configuration.

Some character sets cannot be used as the client character set.
Attempting to use them with [`SET CHARACTER
SET`](set-character-set.md "15.7.6.2 SET CHARACTER SET Statement") produces an error. See
[Impermissible Client Character Sets](charset-connection.md#charset-connection-impermissible-client-charset "Impermissible Client Character Sets").
