#### 8.4.1.2 Caching SHA-2 Pluggable Authentication

MySQL provides two authentication plugins that implement SHA-256
hashing for user account passwords:

- `caching_sha2_password`: Implements SHA-256
  authentication (like the deprecated
  `sha256_password`), but uses caching on the
  server side for better performance and has additional
  features for wider applicability.
- `sha256_password`: Implements basic SHA-256
  authentication. This is deprecated as of MySQL 8.0.16 and
  subject to removal in the future.

This section describes the caching SHA-2 authentication plugin.
For information about the original basic (noncaching) plugin,
see [Section 8.4.1.3, “SHA-256 Pluggable Authentication”](sha256-pluggable-authentication.md "8.4.1.3 SHA-256 Pluggable Authentication").

Important

In MySQL 8.0, `caching_sha2_password` is the
default authentication plugin rather than
`mysql_native_password`. For information
about the implications of this change for server operation and
compatibility of the server with clients and connectors, see
[caching\_sha2\_password as the Preferred Authentication Plugin](upgrading-from-previous-series.md#upgrade-caching-sha2-password "caching_sha2_password as the Preferred Authentication Plugin").

Important

To connect to the server using an account that authenticates
with the `caching_sha2_password` plugin, you
must use either a secure connection or an unencrypted
connection that supports password exchange using an RSA key
pair, as described later in this section. Either way, the
`caching_sha2_password` plugin uses
MySQL's encryption capabilities. See
[Section 8.3, “Using Encrypted Connections”](encrypted-connections.md "8.3 Using Encrypted Connections").

Note

In the name `sha256_password`,
“sha256” refers to the 256-bit digest length the
plugin uses for encryption. In the name
`caching_sha2_password`, “sha2”
refers more generally to the SHA-2 class of encryption
algorithms, of which 256-bit encryption is one instance. The
latter name choice leaves room for future expansion of
possible digest lengths without changing the plugin name.

The `caching_sha2_password` plugin has these
advantages, compared to `sha256_password`:

- On the server side, an in-memory cache enables faster
  reauthentication of users who have connected previously when
  they connect again.
- RSA-based password exchange is available regardless of the
  SSL library against which MySQL is linked.
- Support is provided for client connections that use the Unix
  socket-file and shared-memory protocols.

The following table shows the plugin names on the server and
client sides.

##### Installing SHA-2 Pluggable Authentication

The `caching_sha2_password` plugin exists in
server and client forms:

- The server-side plugin is built into the server, need not
  be loaded explicitly, and cannot be disabled by unloading
  it.
- The client-side plugin is built into the
  `libmysqlclient` client library and is
  available to any program linked against
  `libmysqlclient`.

The server-side plugin uses the
`sha2_cache_cleaner` audit plugin as a helper
to perform password cache management.
`sha2_cache_cleaner`, like
`caching_sha2_password`, is built in and need
not be installed.

##### Using SHA-2 Pluggable Authentication

To set up an account that uses the
`caching_sha2_password` plugin for SHA-256
password hashing, use the following statement, where
*`password`* is the desired account
password:

```sql
CREATE USER 'sha2user'@'localhost'
IDENTIFIED WITH caching_sha2_password BY 'password';
```

The server assigns the
`caching_sha2_password` plugin to the account
and uses it to encrypt the password using SHA-256, storing
those values in the `plugin` and
`authentication_string` columns of the
`mysql.user` system table.

The preceding instructions do not assume that
`caching_sha2_password` is the default
authentication plugin. If
`caching_sha2_password` is the default
authentication plugin, a simpler [`CREATE
USER`](create-user.md "15.7.1.3 CREATE USER Statement") syntax can be used.

To start the server with the default authentication plugin set
to `caching_sha2_password`, put these lines
in the server option file:

```ini
[mysqld]
default_authentication_plugin=caching_sha2_password
```

That causes the `caching_sha2_password`
plugin to be used by default for new accounts. As a result, it
is possible to create the account and set its password without
naming the plugin explicitly:

```sql
CREATE USER 'sha2user'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'password';
```

Another consequence of setting
[`default_authentication_plugin`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_default_authentication_plugin)
to `caching_sha2_password` is that, to use
some other plugin for account creation, you must specify that
plugin explicitly. For example, to use the deprecated
`mysql_native_password` plugin, use this
statement:

```sql
CREATE USER 'nativeuser'@'localhost'
IDENTIFIED WITH mysql_native_password BY 'password';
```

`caching_sha2_password` supports connections
over secure transport. If you follow the RSA configuration
procedure given later in this section, it also supports
encrypted password exchange using RSA over unencrypted
connections. RSA support has these characteristics:

- On the server side, two system variables name the RSA
  private and public key-pair files:
  [`caching_sha2_password_private_key_path`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_caching_sha2_password_private_key_path)
  and
  [`caching_sha2_password_public_key_path`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_caching_sha2_password_public_key_path).
  The database administrator must set these variables at
  server startup if the key files to use have names that
  differ from the system variable default values.
- The server uses the
  [`caching_sha2_password_auto_generate_rsa_keys`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_caching_sha2_password_auto_generate_rsa_keys)
  system variable to determine whether to automatically
  generate the RSA key-pair files. See
  [Section 8.3.3, “Creating SSL and RSA Certificates and Keys”](creating-ssl-rsa-files.md "8.3.3 Creating SSL and RSA Certificates and Keys").
- The
  [`Caching_sha2_password_rsa_public_key`](server-status-variables.md#statvar_Caching_sha2_password_rsa_public_key)
  status variable displays the RSA public key value used by
  the `caching_sha2_password`
  authentication plugin.
- Clients that are in possession of the RSA public key can
  perform RSA key pair-based password exchange with the
  server during the connection process, as described later.
- For connections by accounts that authenticate with
  `caching_sha2_password` and RSA key
  pair-based password exchange, the server does not send the
  RSA public key to clients by default. Clients can use a
  client-side copy of the required public key, or request
  the public key from the server.

  Use of a trusted local copy of the public key enables the
  client to avoid a round trip in the client/server
  protocol, and is more secure than requesting the public
  key from the server. On the other hand, requesting the
  public key from the server is more convenient (it requires
  no management of a client-side file) and may be acceptable
  in secure network environments.

  - For command-line clients, use the
    [`--server-public-key-path`](mysql-command-options.md#option_mysql_server-public-key-path)
    option to specify the RSA public key file. Use the
    [`--get-server-public-key`](mysql-command-options.md#option_mysql_get-server-public-key)
    option to request the public key from the server. The
    following programs support the two options:
    [**mysql**](mysql.md "6.5.1 mysql — The MySQL Command-Line Client"), **mysqlsh**,
    [**mysqladmin**](mysqladmin.md "6.5.2 mysqladmin — A MySQL Server Administration Program"),
    [**mysqlbinlog**](mysqlbinlog.md "6.6.9 mysqlbinlog — Utility for Processing Binary Log Files"),
    [**mysqlcheck**](mysqlcheck.md "6.5.3 mysqlcheck — A Table Maintenance Program"),
    [**mysqldump**](mysqldump.md "6.5.4 mysqldump — A Database Backup Program"),
    [**mysqlimport**](mysqlimport.md "6.5.5 mysqlimport — A Data Import Program"),
    [**mysqlpump**](mysqlpump.md "6.5.6 mysqlpump — A Database Backup Program"),
    [**mysqlshow**](mysqlshow.md "6.5.7 mysqlshow — Display Database, Table, and Column Information"),
    [**mysqlslap**](mysqlslap.md "6.5.8 mysqlslap — A Load Emulation Client"),
    **mysqltest**,
    [**mysql\_upgrade**](mysql-upgrade.md "6.4.5 mysql_upgrade — Check and Upgrade MySQL Tables").
  - For programs that use the C API, call
    [`mysql_options()`](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/c-api/8.0/en/mysql-options.html) to
    specify the RSA public key file by passing the
    `MYSQL_SERVER_PUBLIC_KEY` option and
    the name of the file, or request the public key from
    the server by passing the
    `MYSQL_OPT_GET_SERVER_PUBLIC_KEY`
    option.
  - For replicas, use the [`CHANGE
    REPLICATION SOURCE TO`](change-replication-source-to.md "15.4.2.3 CHANGE REPLICATION SOURCE TO Statement") statement (from MySQL
    8.0.23) or [`CHANGE MASTER
    TO`](change-master-to.md "15.4.2.1 CHANGE MASTER TO Statement") statement (before MySQL 8.0.23) with the
    `SOURCE_PUBLIC_KEY_PATH` |
    `MASTER_PUBLIC_KEY_PATH` option to
    specify the RSA public key file, or the
    `GET_SOURCE_PUBLIC_KEY` |
    `GET_MASTER_PUBLIC_KEY` option to
    request the public key from the source. For Group
    Replication, the
    [`group_replication_recovery_public_key_path`](group-replication-system-variables.md#sysvar_group_replication_recovery_public_key_path)
    and
    [`group_replication_recovery_get_public_key`](group-replication-system-variables.md#sysvar_group_replication_recovery_get_public_key)
    system variables serve the same purpose.

  In all cases, if the option is given to specify a valid
  public key file, it takes precedence over the option to
  request the public key from the server.

For clients that use the
`caching_sha2_password` plugin, passwords are
never exposed as cleartext when connecting to the server. How
password transmission occurs depends on whether a secure
connection or RSA encryption is used:

- If the connection is secure, an RSA key pair is
  unnecessary and is not used. This applies to TCP
  connections encrypted using TLS, as well as Unix
  socket-file and shared-memory connections. The password is
  sent as cleartext but cannot be snooped because the
  connection is secure.
- If the connection is not secure, an RSA key pair is used.
  This applies to TCP connections not encrypted using TLS
  and named-pipe connections. RSA is used only for password
  exchange between client and server, to prevent password
  snooping. When the server receives the encrypted password,
  it decrypts it. A scramble is used in the encryption to
  prevent repeat attacks.

To enable use of an RSA key pair for password exchange during
the client connection process, use the following procedure:

1. Create the RSA private and public key-pair files using the
   instructions in [Section 8.3.3, “Creating SSL and RSA Certificates and Keys”](creating-ssl-rsa-files.md "8.3.3 Creating SSL and RSA Certificates and Keys").
2. If the private and public key files are located in the
   data directory and are named
   `private_key.pem` and
   `public_key.pem` (the default values of
   the
   [`caching_sha2_password_private_key_path`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_caching_sha2_password_private_key_path)
   and
   [`caching_sha2_password_public_key_path`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_caching_sha2_password_public_key_path)
   system variables), the server uses them automatically at
   startup.

   Otherwise, to name the key files explicitly, set the
   system variables to the key file names in the server
   option file. If the files are located in the server data
   directory, you need not specify their full path names:

   ```ini
   [mysqld]
   caching_sha2_password_private_key_path=myprivkey.pem
   caching_sha2_password_public_key_path=mypubkey.pem
   ```

   If the key files are not located in the data directory, or
   to make their locations explicit in the system variable
   values, use full path names:

   ```ini
   [mysqld]
   caching_sha2_password_private_key_path=/usr/local/mysql/myprivkey.pem
   caching_sha2_password_public_key_path=/usr/local/mysql/mypubkey.pem
   ```
3. If you want to change the number of hash rounds used by
   `caching_sha2_password` during password
   generation, set the
   [`caching_sha2_password_digest_rounds`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_caching_sha2_password_digest_rounds)
   system variable. For example:

   ```ini
   [mysqld]
   caching_sha2_password_digest_rounds=10000
   ```
4. Restart the server, then connect to it and check the
   [`Caching_sha2_password_rsa_public_key`](server-status-variables.md#statvar_Caching_sha2_password_rsa_public_key)
   status variable value. The value actually displayed
   differs from that shown here, but should be nonempty:

   ```sql
   mysql> SHOW STATUS LIKE 'Caching_sha2_password_rsa_public_key'\G
   *************************** 1. row ***************************
   Variable_name: Caching_sha2_password_rsa_public_key
           Value: -----BEGIN PUBLIC KEY-----
   MIGfMA0GCSqGSIb3DQEBAQUAA4GNADCBiQKBgQDO9nRUDd+KvSZgY7cNBZMNpwX6
   MvE1PbJFXO7u18nJ9lwc99Du/E7lw6CVXw7VKrXPeHbVQUzGyUNkf45Nz/ckaaJa
   aLgJOBCIDmNVnyU54OT/1lcs2xiyfaDMe8fCJ64ZwTnKbY2gkt1IMjUAB5Ogd5kJ
   g8aV7EtKwyhHb0c30QIDAQAB
   -----END PUBLIC KEY-----
   ```

   If the value is empty, the server found some problem with
   the key files. Check the error log for diagnostic
   information.

After the server has been configured with the RSA key files,
accounts that authenticate with the
`caching_sha2_password` plugin have the
option of using those key files to connect to the server. As
mentioned previously, such accounts can use either a secure
connection (in which case RSA is not used) or an unencrypted
connection that performs password exchange using RSA. Suppose
that an unencrypted connection is used. For example:

```terminal
$> mysql --ssl-mode=DISABLED -u sha2user -p
Enter password: password
```

For this connection attempt by `sha2user`,
the server determines that
`caching_sha2_password` is the appropriate
authentication plugin and invokes it (because that was the
plugin specified at [`CREATE USER`](create-user.md "15.7.1.3 CREATE USER Statement")
time). The plugin finds that the connection is not encrypted
and thus requires the password to be transmitted using RSA
encryption. However, the server does not send the public key
to the client, and the client provided no public key, so it
cannot encrypt the password and the connection fails:

```simple
ERROR 2061 (HY000): Authentication plugin 'caching_sha2_password'
reported error: Authentication requires secure connection.
```

To request the RSA public key from the server, specify the
[`--get-server-public-key`](mysql-command-options.md#option_mysql_get-server-public-key) option:

```terminal
$> mysql --ssl-mode=DISABLED -u sha2user -p --get-server-public-key
Enter password: password
```

In this case, the server sends the RSA public key to the
client, which uses it to encrypt the password and returns the
result to the server. The plugin uses the RSA private key on
the server side to decrypt the password and accepts or rejects
the connection based on whether the password is correct.

Alternatively, if the client has a file containing a local
copy of the RSA public key required by the server, it can
specify the file using the
[`--server-public-key-path`](mysql-command-options.md#option_mysql_server-public-key-path) option:

```terminal
$> mysql --ssl-mode=DISABLED -u sha2user -p --server-public-key-path=file_name
Enter password: password
```

In this case, the client uses the public key to encrypt the
password and returns the result to the server. The plugin uses
the RSA private key on the server side to decrypt the password
and accepts or rejects the connection based on whether the
password is correct.

The public key value in the file named by the
[`--server-public-key-path`](mysql-command-options.md#option_mysql_server-public-key-path) option
should be the same as the key value in the server-side file
named by the
[`caching_sha2_password_public_key_path`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_caching_sha2_password_public_key_path)
system variable. If the key file contains a valid public key
value but the value is incorrect, an access-denied error
occurs. If the key file does not contain a valid public key,
the client program cannot use it.

Client users can obtain the RSA public key two ways:

- The database administrator can provide a copy of the
  public key file.
- A client user who can connect to the server some other way
  can use a `SHOW STATUS LIKE
  'Caching_sha2_password_rsa_public_key'` statement
  and save the returned key value in a file.

##### Cache Operation for SHA-2 Pluggable Authentication

On the server side, the
`caching_sha2_password` plugin uses an
in-memory cache for faster authentication of clients who have
connected previously. Entries consist of
account-name/password-hash pairs. The cache works like this:

1. When a client connects,
   `caching_sha2_password` checks whether
   the client and password match some cache entry. If so,
   authentication succeeds.
2. If there is no matching cache entry, the plugin attempts
   to verify the client against the credentials in the
   `mysql.user` system table. If this
   succeeds, `caching_sha2_password` adds an
   entry for the client to the hash. Otherwise,
   authentication fails and the connection is rejected.

In this way, when a client first connects, authentication
against the `mysql.user` system table occurs.
When the client connects subsequently, faster authentication
against the cache occurs.

Password cache operations other than adding entries are
handled by the `sha2_cache_cleaner` audit
plugin, which performs these actions on behalf of
`caching_sha2_password`:

- It clears the cache entry for any account that is renamed
  or dropped, or any account for which the credentials or
  authentication plugin are changed.
- It empties the cache when the [`FLUSH
  PRIVILEGES`](flush.md#flush-privileges) statement is executed.
- It empties the cache at server shutdown. (This means the
  cache is not persistent across server restarts.)

Cache clearing operations affect the authentication
requirements for subsequent client connections. For each user
account, the first client connection for the user after any of
the following operations must use a secure connection (made
using TCP using TLS credentials, a Unix socket file, or shared
memory) or RSA key pair-based password exchange:

- After account creation.
- After a password change for the account.
- After [`RENAME USER`](rename-user.md "15.7.1.7 RENAME USER Statement") for the
  account.
- After [`FLUSH PRIVILEGES`](flush.md#flush-privileges).

[`FLUSH PRIVILEGES`](flush.md#flush-privileges) clears the
entire cache and affects all accounts that use the
`caching_sha2_password` plugin. The other
operations clear specific cache entries and affect only
accounts that are part of the operation.

Once the user authenticates successfully, the account is
entered into the cache and subsequent connections do not
require a secure connection or the RSA key pair, until another
cache clearing event occurs that affects the account. (When
the cache can be used, the server uses a challenge-response
mechanism that does not use cleartext password transmission
and does not require a secure connection.)
