[19.4.1.3 Backing Up a Source or Replica by Making It Read Only](replication-solutions-backups-read-only.md)

To use replication as a backup solution, replicate data from the
source to a replica, and then back up the replica. The replica can
be paused and shut down without affecting the running operation of
the source, so you can produce an effective snapshot of
“live” data that would otherwise require the source
to be shut down.

How you back up a database depends on its size and whether you are
backing up only the data, or the data and the replica state so
that you can rebuild the replica in the event of failure. There
are therefore two choices:

- If you are using replication as a solution to enable you to
  back up the data on the source, and the size of your database
  is not too large, the [**mysqldump**](mysqldump.md "6.5.4 mysqldump — A Database Backup Program") tool may be
  suitable. See
  [Section 19.4.1.1, “Backing Up a Replica Using mysqldump”](replication-solutions-backups-mysqldump.md "19.4.1.1 Backing Up a Replica Using mysqldump").
- For larger databases, where [**mysqldump**](mysqldump.md "6.5.4 mysqldump — A Database Backup Program") would
  be impractical or inefficient, you can back up the raw data
  files instead. Using the raw data files option also means that
  you can back up the binary and relay logs that make it
  possible to re-create the replica in the event of a replica
  failure. For more information, see
  [Section 19.4.1.2, “Backing Up Raw Data from a Replica”](replication-solutions-backups-rawdata.md "19.4.1.2 Backing Up Raw Data from a Replica").

Another backup strategy, which can be used for either source or
replica servers, is to put the server in a read-only state. The
backup is performed against the read-only server, which then is
changed back to its usual read/write operational status. See
[Section 19.4.1.3, “Backing Up a Source or Replica by Making It Read Only”](replication-solutions-backups-read-only.md "19.4.1.3 Backing Up a Source or Replica by Making It Read Only").
