#### 10.12.3.3 Enabling Large Page Support

Some hardware and operating system architectures support
memory pages greater than the default (usually 4KB). The
actual implementation of this support depends on the
underlying hardware and operating system. Applications that
perform a lot of memory accesses may obtain performance
improvements by using large pages due to reduced Translation
Lookaside Buffer (TLB) misses.

In MySQL, large pages can be used by
[`InnoDB`](innodb-storage-engine.md "Chapter 17 The InnoDB Storage Engine"), to allocate memory for
its buffer pool and additional memory pool.

Standard use of large pages in MySQL attempts to use the
largest size supported, up to 4MB. Under Solaris, a
“super large pages” feature enables uses of pages
up to 256MB. This feature is available for recent SPARC
platforms. It can be enabled or disabled by using the
[`--super-large-pages`](server-options.md#option_mysqld_super-large-pages) or
[`--skip-super-large-pages`](server-options.md#option_mysqld_super-large-pages)
option.

MySQL also supports the Linux implementation of large page
support (which is called HugeTLB in Linux).

Before large pages can be used on Linux, the kernel must be
enabled to support them and it is necessary to configure the
HugeTLB memory pool. For reference, the HugeTBL API is
documented in the
`Documentation/vm/hugetlbpage.txt` file of
your Linux sources.

The kernels for some recent systems such as Red Hat Enterprise
Linux may have the large pages feature enabled by default. To
check whether this is true for your kernel, use the following
command and look for output lines containing
“huge”:

```terminal
$> grep -i huge /proc/meminfo
AnonHugePages:   2658304 kB
ShmemHugePages:        0 kB
HugePages_Total:       0
HugePages_Free:        0
HugePages_Rsvd:        0
HugePages_Surp:        0
Hugepagesize:       2048 kB
Hugetlb:               0 kB
```

The nonempty command output indicates that large page support
is present, but the zero values indicate that no pages are
configured for use.

If your kernel needs to be reconfigured to support large
pages, consult the `hugetlbpage.txt` file
for instructions.

Assuming that your Linux kernel has large page support
enabled, configure it for use by MySQL using the following
steps:

1. Determine the number of large pages needed. This is the
   size of the InnoDB buffer pool divided by the large page
   size, which we can calculate as
   [`innodb_buffer_pool_size`](innodb-parameters.md#sysvar_innodb_buffer_pool_size) /
   `Hugepagesize`. Assuming the default
   value for the
   [`innodb_buffer_pool_size`](innodb-parameters.md#sysvar_innodb_buffer_pool_size)
   (128MB) and using the `Hugepagesize`
   value obtained from `/proc/meminfo`
   (2MB), this is 128MB / 2MB, or 64 Huge Pages. We call this
   value *`P`*.
2. As system root, open the file
   `/etc/sysctl.conf` in a text editor,
   and add the line shown here, where
   *`P`* is the number of large pages
   obtained in the previous step:

   ```ini
   vm.nr_hugepages=P
   ```

   Using the actual value obtained previously, the additional
   line should look like this:

   ```ini
   vm.nr_hugepages=66
   ```

   Save the updated file.
3. As system root, run the following command:

   ```simple
   $> sudo sysctl -p
   ```

   Note

   On some systems the large pages file may be named
   slightly differently; for example, some distributions
   call it `nr_hugepages`. In the event
   **sysctl** returns an error
   relating to the file name, check the name of the
   corresponding file in `/proc/sys/vm`
   and use that instead.

   To verify the large page configuration, check
   `/proc/meminfo` again as described
   previously. Now you should see some additional nonzero
   values in the output, similar to this:

   ```terminal
   $> grep -i huge /proc/meminfo
   AnonHugePages:   2686976 kB
   ShmemHugePages:        0 kB
   HugePages_Total:     233
   HugePages_Free:      233
   HugePages_Rsvd:        0
   HugePages_Surp:        0
   Hugepagesize:       2048 kB
   Hugetlb:          477184 kB
   ```
4. Optionally, you may wish to compact the Linux VM. You can
   do this using a sequence of commands, possibly in a script
   file, similar to what is shown here:

   ```bash
   sync
   sync
   sync
   echo 3 > /proc/sys/vm/drop_caches
   echo 1 > /proc/sys/vm/compact_memory
   ```

   See your operating platform documentation for more
   information about how to do this.
5. Check any configuration files such as
   `my.cnf` used by the server, and make
   sure that
   [`innodb_buffer_pool_chunk_size`](innodb-parameters.md#sysvar_innodb_buffer_pool_chunk_size)
   is set larger than the huge page size. The default for
   this variable is 128M.
6. Large page support in the MySQL server is disabled by
   default. To enable it, start the server with
   [`--large-pages`](server-options.md#option_mysqld_large-pages). You can also
   do so by adding the following line to the
   `[mysqld]` section of the server
   `my.cnf` file:

   ```ini
   large-pages=ON
   ```

   With this option enabled, `InnoDB` uses
   large pages automatically for its buffer pool and
   additional memory pool. If `InnoDB`
   cannot do this, it falls back to use of traditional memory
   and writes a warning to the error log: Warning:
   Using conventional memory pool.

You can verify that MySQL is now using large pages by checking
`/proc/meminfo` again after restarting
[**mysqld**](mysqld.md "6.3.1 mysqld — The MySQL Server"), like this:

```terminal
$> grep -i huge /proc/meminfo
AnonHugePages:   2516992 kB
ShmemHugePages:        0 kB
HugePages_Total:     233
HugePages_Free:      222
HugePages_Rsvd:       55
HugePages_Surp:        0
Hugepagesize:       2048 kB
Hugetlb:          477184 kB
```
