#### 19.5.1.26 Replication and Reserved Words

You can encounter problems when you attempt to replicate from an
older source to a newer replica and you make use of identifiers
on the source that are reserved words in the newer MySQL version
running on the replica. For example, a table column named
`rank` on a MySQL 5.7 source that is
replicating to a MySQL 8.0 replica could cause a
problem because `RANK` is a reserved word
beginning in MySQL 8.0.

Replication can fail in such cases with Error 1064
You have an error in your SQL syntax...,
*even if a database or table named using the reserved
word or a table having a column named using the reserved word is
excluded from replication*. This is due to the fact
that each SQL event must be parsed by the replica prior to
execution, so that the replica knows which database object or
objects would be affected. Only after the event is parsed can
the replica apply any filtering rules defined by
[`--replicate-do-db`](replication-options-replica.md#option_mysqld_replicate-do-db),
[`--replicate-do-table`](replication-options-replica.md#option_mysqld_replicate-do-table),
[`--replicate-ignore-db`](replication-options-replica.md#option_mysqld_replicate-ignore-db), and
[`--replicate-ignore-table`](replication-options-replica.md#option_mysqld_replicate-ignore-table).

To work around the problem of database, table, or column names
on the source which would be regarded as reserved words by the
replica, do one of the following:

- Use one or more [`ALTER TABLE`](alter-table.md "15.1.9 ALTER TABLE Statement")
  statements on the source to change the names of any database
  objects where these names would be considered reserved words
  on the replica, and change any SQL statements that use the
  old names to use the new names instead.
- In any SQL statements using these database object names,
  write the names as quoted identifiers using backtick
  characters (`` ` ``).

For listings of reserved words by MySQL version, see
[Keywords and Reserved Words in MySQL 8.0](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/mysqld-version-reference/en/keywords-8-0.html), in the *MySQL Server
Version Reference*. For identifier quoting rules, see
[Section 11.2, “Schema Object Names”](identifiers.md "11.2 Schema Object Names").
