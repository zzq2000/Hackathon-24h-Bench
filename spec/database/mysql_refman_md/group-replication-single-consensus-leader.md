### 20.7.3 Single Consensus Leader

By default, the group communication engine for Group Replication
(XCom, a Paxos variant) operates using every member of the
replication group as a leader. From MySQL 8.0.27, the group
communication engine can use a single leader to drive consensus
when the group is in single-primary mode. Operating with a single
consensus leader improves performance and resilience in
single-primary mode, particularly when some of the group’s
secondary members are currently unreachable.

To use a single consensus leader, the group must be configured as
follows:

- The group must be in single-primary mode.
- The
  [`group_replication_paxos_single_leader`](group-replication-system-variables.md#sysvar_group_replication_paxos_single_leader)
  system variable must be set to `ON`. With the
  default setting `OFF`, the behavior is
  disabled. You must carry out a full reboot of the replication
  group (bootstrap) for Group Replication to pick up a change to
  this setting.
- The Group Replication communication protocol version must be
  set to 8.0.27 or later. Use the
  [`group_replication_get_communication_protocol()`](group-replication-functions-for-communication-protocol.md#function_group-replication-get-communication-protocol)
  function to view the group's communication protocol version.
  If a lower version is in use, the group cannot use this
  behavior. You can use the
  [`group_replication_set_communication_protocol()`](group-replication-functions-for-communication-protocol.md#function_group-replication-set-communication-protocol)
  function to set the group's communication protocol to a higher
  version if all group members support it. MySQL InnoDB Cluster
  manages the communication protocol version automatically. For
  more information, see
  [Section 20.5.1.4, “Setting a Group's Communication Protocol Version”](group-replication-communication-protocol.md "20.5.1.4 Setting a Group's Communication Protocol Version").

When this configuration is in place, Group Replication instructs
the group communication engine to use the group’s primary as the
single leader to drive consensus. When a new primary is elected,
Group Replication tells the group communication engine to use it
instead. If the primary is currently unhealthy, the group
communication engine uses an alternative member as the consensus
leader. The Performance Schema table
[`replication_group_communication_information`](performance-schema-replication-group-communication-information-table.md "29.12.11.12 The replication_group_communication_information Table")
shows the current preferred and actual consensus leader, with the
preferred leader being Group Replication’s choice, and the
actual leader being the one selected by the group communication
engine.

If the group is in multi-primary mode, has a lower communication
protocol version, or the behavior is disabled by the
[`group_replication_paxos_single_leader`](group-replication-system-variables.md#sysvar_group_replication_paxos_single_leader)
setting, all members are used as leaders to drive consensus. In
this situation, the Performance Schema table
[`replication_group_communication_information`](performance-schema-replication-group-communication-information-table.md "29.12.11.12 The replication_group_communication_information Table")
shows all of the members as both the preferred and actual leaders.

The `WRITE_CONSENSUS_SINGLE_LEADER_CAPABLE`
column of the Performance Schema table
[`replication_group_communication_information`](performance-schema-replication-group-communication-information-table.md "29.12.11.12 The replication_group_communication_information Table")
table shows whether the group supports the use of a single leader,
even if
[`group_replication_paxos_single_leader`](group-replication-system-variables.md#sysvar_group_replication_paxos_single_leader)
is currently set to `OFF` on the queried member.
The column value is 1 if the group was started with
[`group_replication_paxos_single_leader`](group-replication-system-variables.md#sysvar_group_replication_paxos_single_leader)
set to `ON`, and its communication protocol
version is MySQL 8.0.27 or above. This information is only
returned for group members in `ONLINE` or
`RECOVERING` state.
