### 12.9.5 The utf16 Character Set (UTF-16 Unicode Encoding)

The `utf16` character set is the
`ucs2` character set with an extension that
enables encoding of supplementary characters:

- For a BMP character, `utf16` and
  `ucs2` have identical storage
  characteristics: same code values, same encoding, same
  length.
- For a supplementary character, `utf16` has
  a special sequence for representing the character using 32
  bits. This is called the “surrogate” mechanism:
  For a number greater than `0xffff`, take 10
  bits and add them to `0xd800` and put them
  in the first 16-bit word, take 10 more bits and add them to
  `0xdc00` and put them in the next 16-bit
  word. Consequently, all supplementary characters require 32
  bits, where the first 16 bits are a number between
  `0xd800` and `0xdbff`, and
  the last 16 bits are a number between
  `0xdc00` and `0xdfff`.
  Examples are in Section
  [15.5
  Surrogates Area](http://www.unicode.org/versions/Unicode4.0.0/ch15.pdf) of the Unicode 4.0 document.

Because `utf16` supports surrogates and
`ucs2` does not, there is a validity check that
applies only in `utf16`: You cannot insert a
top surrogate without a bottom surrogate, or vice versa. For
example:

```sql
INSERT INTO t (ucs2_column) VALUES (0xd800); /* legal */
INSERT INTO t (utf16_column)VALUES (0xd800); /* illegal */
```

There is no validity check for characters that are technically
valid but are not true Unicode (that is, characters that Unicode
considers to be “unassigned code points” or
“private use” characters or even
“illegals” like `0xffff`). For
example, since `U+F8FF` is the Apple Logo, this
is legal:

```sql
INSERT INTO t (utf16_column)VALUES (0xf8ff); /* legal */
```

Such characters cannot be expected to mean the same thing to
everyone.

Because MySQL must allow for the worst case (that one character
requires four bytes) the maximum length of a
`utf16` column or index is only half of the
maximum length for a `ucs2` column or index.
For example, the maximum length of a `MEMORY`
table index key is 3072 bytes, so these statements create tables
with the longest permitted indexes for `ucs2`
and `utf16` columns:

```sql
CREATE TABLE tf (s1 VARCHAR(1536) CHARACTER SET ucs2) ENGINE=MEMORY;
CREATE INDEX i ON tf (s1);
CREATE TABLE tg (s1 VARCHAR(768) CHARACTER SET utf16) ENGINE=MEMORY;
CREATE INDEX i ON tg (s1);
```
