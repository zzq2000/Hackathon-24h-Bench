### 19.5.5 How to Report Replication Bugs or Problems

When you have determined that there is no user error involved, and
replication still either does not work at all or is unstable, it
is time to send us a bug report. We need to obtain as much
information as possible from you to be able to track down the bug.
Please spend some time and effort in preparing a good bug report.

If you have a repeatable test case that demonstrates the bug,
please enter it into our bugs database using the instructions
given in [Section 1.5, “How to Report Bugs or Problems”](bug-reports.md "1.5 How to Report Bugs or Problems"). If you have a
“phantom” problem (one that you cannot duplicate at
will), use the following procedure:

1. Verify that no user error is involved. For example, if you
   update the replica outside of the replication threads, the
   data goes out of synchrony, and you can have unique key
   violations on updates. In this case, the replication thread
   stops and waits for you to clean up the tables manually to
   bring them into synchrony. *This is not a replication
   problem. It is a problem of outside interference causing
   replication to fail.*
2. Ensure that the replica is running with binary logging enabled
   (the [`log_bin`](replication-options-binary-log.md#sysvar_log_bin) system
   variable), and with the
   [`--log-slave-updates`](replication-options-binary-log.md#sysvar_log_slave_updates) option
   enabled, which causes the replica to log the updates that it
   receives from the source into its own binary logs. These
   settings are the defaults.
3. Save all evidence before resetting the replication state. If
   we have no information or only sketchy information, it becomes
   difficult or impossible for us to track down the problem. The
   evidence you should collect is:

   - All binary log files from the source
   - All binary log files from the replica
   - The output of [`SHOW MASTER
     STATUS`](show-master-status.md "15.7.7.23 SHOW MASTER STATUS Statement") from the source at the time you
     discovered the problem
   - The output of [`SHOW REPLICA
     STATUS`](show-replica-status.md "15.7.7.35 SHOW REPLICA STATUS Statement") from the replica at the time you
     discovered the problem
   - Error logs from the source and the replica
4. Use [**mysqlbinlog**](mysqlbinlog.md "6.6.9 mysqlbinlog — Utility for Processing Binary Log Files") to examine the binary logs.
   The following should be helpful to find the problem statement.
   *`log_file`* and
   *`log_pos`* are the
   `Master_Log_File` and
   `Read_Master_Log_Pos` values from
   [`SHOW REPLICA STATUS`](show-replica-status.md "15.7.7.35 SHOW REPLICA STATUS Statement").

   ```terminal
   $> mysqlbinlog --start-position=log_pos log_file | head
   ```

After you have collected the evidence for the problem, try to
isolate it as a separate test case first. Then enter the problem
with as much information as possible into our bugs database using
the instructions at [Section 1.5, “How to Report Bugs or Problems”](bug-reports.md "1.5 How to Report Bugs or Problems").
