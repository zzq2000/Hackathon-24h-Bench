## 26.1 Overview of Partitioning in MySQL

This section provides a conceptual overview of partitioning in
MySQL 8.0.

For information on partitioning restrictions and feature
limitations, see [Section 26.6, “Restrictions and Limitations on Partitioning”](partitioning-limitations.md "26.6 Restrictions and Limitations on Partitioning").

The SQL standard does not provide much in the way of guidance
regarding the physical aspects of data storage. The SQL language
itself is intended to work independently of any data structures or
media underlying the schemas, tables, rows, or columns with which
it works. Nonetheless, most advanced database management systems
have evolved some means of determining the physical location to be
used for storing specific pieces of data in terms of the file
system, hardware or even both. In MySQL, the
`InnoDB` storage engine has long supported the
notion of a tablespace (see [Section 17.6.3, “Tablespaces”](innodb-tablespace.md "17.6.3 Tablespaces")),
and the MySQL Server, even prior to the introduction of
partitioning, could be configured to employ different physical
directories for storing different databases (see
[Section 10.12.2, “Using Symbolic Links”](symbolic-links.md "10.12.2 Using Symbolic Links"), for an explanation of how this
is done).

Partitioning takes this
notion a step further, by enabling you to distribute portions of
individual tables across a file system according to rules which
you can set largely as needed. In effect, different portions of a
table are stored as separate tables in different locations. The
user-selected rule by which the division of data is accomplished
is known as a partitioning
function, which in MySQL can be the modulus, simple
matching against a set of ranges or value lists, an internal
hashing function, or a linear hashing function. The function is
selected according to the partitioning type specified by the user,
and takes as its parameter the value of a user-supplied
expression. This expression can be a column value, a function
acting on one or more column values, or a set of one or more
column values, depending on the type of partitioning that is used.

In the case of `RANGE`, `LIST`,
and [`LINEAR`] `HASH`
partitioning, the value of the partitioning column is passed to
the partitioning function, which returns an integer value
representing the number of the partition in which that particular
record should be stored. This function must be nonconstant and
nonrandom. It may not contain any queries, but may use an SQL
expression that is valid in MySQL, as long as that expression
returns either `NULL` or an integer
*`intval`* such that

```simple
-MAXVALUE <= intval <= MAXVALUE
```

(`MAXVALUE` is used to represent the least upper
bound for the type of integer in question.
`-MAXVALUE` represents the greatest lower bound.)

For [`LINEAR`] `KEY`,
`RANGE COLUMNS`, and `LIST
COLUMNS` partitioning, the partitioning expression
consists of a list of one or more columns.

For [`LINEAR`] `KEY`
partitioning, the partitioning function is supplied by MySQL.

For more information about permitted partitioning column types and
partitioning functions, see [Section 26.2, “Partitioning Types”](partitioning-types.md "26.2 Partitioning Types"),
as well as [Section 15.1.20, “CREATE TABLE Statement”](create-table.md "15.1.20 CREATE TABLE Statement"), which provides
partitioning syntax descriptions and additional examples. For
information about restrictions on partitioning functions, see
[Section 26.6.3, “Partitioning Limitations Relating to Functions”](partitioning-limitations-functions.md "26.6.3 Partitioning Limitations Relating to Functions").

This is known as horizontal
partitioning—that is, different rows of a table
may be assigned to different physical partitions. MySQL
8.0 does not support
vertical partitioning, in
which different columns of a table are assigned to different
physical partitions. There are no plans at this time to introduce
vertical partitioning into MySQL.

For creating partitioned tables, you must use a storage engine
that supports them. In MySQL 8.0, all partitions of
the same partitioned table must use the same storage engine.
However, there is nothing preventing you from using different
storage engines for different partitioned tables on the same MySQL
server or even in the same database.

In MySQL 8.0, the only storage engines that support
partitioning are `InnoDB` and
[`NDB`](mysql-cluster.md "Chapter 25 MySQL NDB Cluster 8.0"). Partitioning cannot be used with
storage engines that do not support it; these include the
`MyISAM`, `MERGE`,
`CSV`, and `FEDERATED` storage
engines.

Partitioning by `KEY` or `LINEAR
KEY` is possible with [`NDB`](mysql-cluster.md "Chapter 25 MySQL NDB Cluster 8.0"),
but other types of user-defined partitioning are not supported for
tables using this storage engine. In addition, an
[`NDB`](mysql-cluster.md "Chapter 25 MySQL NDB Cluster 8.0") table that employs user-defined
partitioning must have an explicit primary key, and any columns
referenced in the table's partitioning expression must be
part of the primary key. However, if no columns are listed in the
`PARTITION BY KEY` or `PARTITION BY
LINEAR KEY` clause of the [`CREATE
TABLE`](create-table.md "15.1.20 CREATE TABLE Statement") or
[`ALTER
TABLE`](alter-table-partition-operations.md "15.1.9.1 ALTER TABLE Partition Operations") statement used to create or modify a
user-partitioned [`NDB`](mysql-cluster.md "Chapter 25 MySQL NDB Cluster 8.0") table, then the
table is not required to have an explicit primary key. For more
information, see
[Section 25.2.7.1, “Noncompliance with SQL Syntax in NDB Cluster”](mysql-cluster-limitations-syntax.md "25.2.7.1 Noncompliance with SQL Syntax in NDB Cluster").

When creating a partitioned table, the default storage engine is
used just as when creating any other table; to override this
behavior, it is necessary only to use the `[STORAGE]
ENGINE` option just as you would for a table that is not
partitioned. The target storage engine must provide native
partitioning support, or the statement fails. You should keep in
mind that `[STORAGE] ENGINE` (and other table
options) need to be listed *before* any
partitioning options are used in a [`CREATE
TABLE`](create-table.md "15.1.20 CREATE TABLE Statement") statement. This example shows how to create a
table that is partitioned by hash into 6 partitions and which uses
the `InnoDB` storage engine (regardless of the
value of [`default_storage_engine`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_default_storage_engine)):

```sql
CREATE TABLE ti (id INT, amount DECIMAL(7,2), tr_date DATE)
    ENGINE=INNODB
    PARTITION BY HASH( MONTH(tr_date) )
    PARTITIONS 6;
```

Each `PARTITION` clause can include a
`[STORAGE] ENGINE` option, but in MySQL
8.0 this has no effect.

Unless otherwise specified, the remaining examples in this
discussion assume that
[`default_storage_engine`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_default_storage_engine) is
`InnoDB`.

Important

Partitioning applies to all data and indexes of a table; you
cannot partition only the data and not the indexes, or vice
versa, nor can you partition only a portion of the table.

Data and indexes for each partition can be assigned to a specific
directory using the `DATA DIRECTORY` and
`INDEX DIRECTORY` options for the
`PARTITION` clause of the
[`CREATE TABLE`](create-table.md "15.1.20 CREATE TABLE Statement") statement used to
create the partitioned table.

Only the `DATA DIRECTORY` option is supported for
individual partitions and subpartitions of
`InnoDB` tables. As of MySQL 8.0.21, the
directory specified in a `DATA DIRECTORY` clause
must be known to `InnoDB`. For more information,
see [Using the DATA DIRECTORY Clause](innodb-create-table-external.md#innodb-create-table-external-data-directory "Using the DATA DIRECTORY Clause").

All columns used in the table's partitioning expression must
be part of every unique key that the table may have, including any
primary key. This means that a table such as this one, created by
the following SQL statement, cannot be partitioned:

```sql
CREATE TABLE tnp (
    id INT NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT,
    ref BIGINT NOT NULL,
    name VARCHAR(255),
    PRIMARY KEY pk (id),
    UNIQUE KEY uk (name)
);
```

Because the keys `pk` and `uk`
have no columns in common, there are no columns available for use
in a partitioning expression. Possible workarounds in this
situation include adding the `name` column to the
table's primary key, adding the `id` column
to `uk`, or simply removing the unique key
altogether. See
[Section 26.6.1, “Partitioning Keys, Primary Keys, and Unique Keys”](partitioning-limitations-partitioning-keys-unique-keys.md "26.6.1 Partitioning Keys, Primary Keys, and Unique Keys"),
for more information.

In addition, `MAX_ROWS` and
`MIN_ROWS` can be used to determine the maximum
and minimum numbers of rows, respectively, that can be stored in
each partition. See [Section 26.3, “Partition Management”](partitioning-management.md "26.3 Partition Management"), for
more information on these options.

The `MAX_ROWS` option can also be useful for
creating NDB Cluster tables with extra partitions, thus allowing
for greater storage of hash indexes. See the documentation for the
[`DataMemory`](mysql-cluster-ndbd-definition.md#ndbparam-ndbd-datamemory) data node
configuration parameter, as well as
[Section 25.2.2, “NDB Cluster Nodes, Node Groups, Fragment Replicas, and Partitions”](mysql-cluster-nodes-groups.md "25.2.2 NDB Cluster Nodes, Node Groups, Fragment Replicas, and Partitions"), for more
information.

Some advantages of partitioning are listed here:

- Partitioning makes it possible to store more data in one table
  than can be held on a single disk or file system partition.
- Data that loses its usefulness can often be easily removed
  from a partitioned table by dropping the partition (or
  partitions) containing only that data. Conversely, the process
  of adding new data can in some cases be greatly facilitated by
  adding one or more new partitions for storing specifically
  that data.
- Some queries can be greatly optimized in virtue of the fact
  that data satisfying a given `WHERE` clause
  can be stored only on one or more partitions, which
  automatically excludes any remaining partitions from the
  search. Because partitions can be altered after a partitioned
  table has been created, you can reorganize your data to
  enhance frequent queries that may not have been often used
  when the partitioning scheme was first set up. This ability to
  exclude non-matching partitions (and thus any rows they
  contain) is often referred to as
  partition pruning. For
  more information, see [Section 26.4, “Partition Pruning”](partitioning-pruning.md "26.4 Partition Pruning").

  In addition, MySQL supports explicit partition selection for
  queries. For example,
  [`SELECT * FROM t
  PARTITION (p0,p1) WHERE c < 5`](select.md "15.2.13 SELECT Statement") selects only those
  rows in partitions `p0` and
  `p1` that match the `WHERE`
  condition. In this case, MySQL does not check any other
  partitions of table `t`; this can greatly
  speed up queries when you already know which partition or
  partitions you wish to examine. Partition selection is also
  supported for the data modification statements
  [`DELETE`](delete.md "15.2.2 DELETE Statement"),
  [`INSERT`](insert.md "15.2.7 INSERT Statement"),
  [`REPLACE`](replace.md "15.2.12 REPLACE Statement"),
  [`UPDATE`](update.md "15.2.17 UPDATE Statement"), and
  [`LOAD DATA`](load-data.md "15.2.9 LOAD DATA Statement"),
  [`LOAD XML`](load-xml.md "15.2.10 LOAD XML Statement"). See the descriptions
  of these statements for more information and examples.
