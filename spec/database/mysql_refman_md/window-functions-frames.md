### 14.20.3 Window Function Frame Specification

The definition of a window used with a window function can
include a frame clause. A frame is a subset of the current
partition and the frame clause specifies how to define the
subset.

Frames are determined with respect to the current row, which
enables a frame to move within a partition depending on the
location of the current row within its partition. Examples:

- By defining a frame to be all rows from the partition start
  to the current row, you can compute running totals for each
  row.
- By defining a frame as extending
  *`N`* rows on either side of the
  current row, you can compute rolling averages.

The following query demonstrates the use of moving frames to
compute running totals within each group of time-ordered
`level` values, as well as rolling averages
computed from the current row and the rows that immediately
precede and follow it:

```sql
mysql> SELECT
         time, subject, val,
         SUM(val) OVER (PARTITION BY subject ORDER BY time
                        ROWS UNBOUNDED PRECEDING)
           AS running_total,
         AVG(val) OVER (PARTITION BY subject ORDER BY time
                        ROWS BETWEEN 1 PRECEDING AND 1 FOLLOWING)
           AS running_average
       FROM observations;
+----------+---------+------+---------------+-----------------+
| time     | subject | val  | running_total | running_average |
+----------+---------+------+---------------+-----------------+
| 07:00:00 | st113   |   10 |            10 |          9.5000 |
| 07:15:00 | st113   |    9 |            19 |         14.6667 |
| 07:30:00 | st113   |   25 |            44 |         18.0000 |
| 07:45:00 | st113   |   20 |            64 |         22.5000 |
| 07:00:00 | xh458   |    0 |             0 |          5.0000 |
| 07:15:00 | xh458   |   10 |            10 |          5.0000 |
| 07:30:00 | xh458   |    5 |            15 |         15.0000 |
| 07:45:00 | xh458   |   30 |            45 |         20.0000 |
| 08:00:00 | xh458   |   25 |            70 |         27.5000 |
+----------+---------+------+---------------+-----------------+
```

For the `running_average` column, there is no
frame row preceding the first one or following the last. In
these cases, [`AVG()`](aggregate-functions.md#function_avg) computes the
average of the rows that are available.

Aggregate functions used as window functions operate on rows in
the current row frame, as do these nonaggregate window
functions:

```sql
FIRST_VALUE()
LAST_VALUE()
NTH_VALUE()
```

Standard SQL specifies that window functions that operate on the
entire partition should have no frame clause. MySQL permits a
frame clause for such functions but ignores it. These functions
use the entire partition even if a frame is specified:

```sql
CUME_DIST()
DENSE_RANK()
LAG()
LEAD()
NTILE()
PERCENT_RANK()
RANK()
ROW_NUMBER()
```

The frame clause, if given, has this syntax:

```sql
frame_clause:
    frame_units frame_extent

frame_units:
    {ROWS | RANGE}
```

In the absence of a frame clause, the default frame depends on
whether an `ORDER BY` clause is present, as
described later in this section.

The *`frame_units`* value indicates the
type of relationship between the current row and frame rows:

- `ROWS`: The frame is defined by beginning
  and ending row positions. Offsets are differences in row
  numbers from the current row number.
- `RANGE`: The frame is defined by rows
  within a value range. Offsets are differences in row values
  from the current row value.

The *`frame_extent`* value indicates the
start and end points of the frame. You can specify just the
start of the frame (in which case the current row is implicitly
the end) or use `BETWEEN` to specify both frame
endpoints:

```sql
frame_extent:
    {frame_start | frame_between}

frame_between:
    BETWEEN frame_start AND frame_end

frame_start, frame_end: {
    CURRENT ROW
  | UNBOUNDED PRECEDING
  | UNBOUNDED FOLLOWING
  | expr PRECEDING
  | expr FOLLOWING
}
```

With `BETWEEN` syntax,
*`frame_start`* must not occur later than
*`frame_end`*.

The permitted *`frame_start`* and
*`frame_end`* values have these meanings:

- `CURRENT ROW`: For `ROWS`,
  the bound is the current row. For `RANGE`,
  the bound is the peers of the current row.
- `UNBOUNDED PRECEDING`: The bound is the
  first partition row.
- `UNBOUNDED FOLLOWING`: The bound is the
  last partition row.
- `expr
  PRECEDING`: For `ROWS`, the bound
  is *`expr`* rows before the current
  row. For `RANGE`, the bound is the rows
  with values equal to the current row value minus
  *`expr`*; if the current row value is
  `NULL`, the bound is the peers of the row.

  For `expr
  PRECEDING` (and
  `expr
  FOLLOWING`), *`expr`* can be
  a `?` parameter marker (for use in a
  prepared statement), a nonnegative numeric literal, or a
  temporal interval of the form `INTERVAL
  val
  unit`. For
  `INTERVAL` expressions,
  *`val`* specifies nonnegative
  interval value, and *`unit`* is a
  keyword indicating the units in which the value should be
  interpreted. (For details about the permitted
  *`units`* specifiers, see the
  description of the [`DATE_ADD()`](date-and-time-functions.md#function_date-add)
  function in [Section 14.7, “Date and Time Functions”](date-and-time-functions.md "14.7 Date and Time Functions").)

  `RANGE` on a numeric or temporal
  *`expr`* requires `ORDER
  BY` on a numeric or temporal expression,
  respectively.

  Examples of valid `expr
  PRECEDING` and
  `expr FOLLOWING`
  indicators:

  ```sql
  10 PRECEDING
  INTERVAL 5 DAY PRECEDING
  5 FOLLOWING
  INTERVAL '2:30' MINUTE_SECOND FOLLOWING
  ```
- `expr
  FOLLOWING`: For `ROWS`, the bound
  is *`expr`* rows after the current
  row. For `RANGE`, the bound is the rows
  with values equal to the current row value plus
  *`expr`*; if the current row value is
  `NULL`, the bound is the peers of the row.

  For permitted values of *`expr`*, see
  the description of `expr
  PRECEDING`.

The following query demonstrates
[`FIRST_VALUE()`](window-function-descriptions.md#function_first-value),
[`LAST_VALUE()`](window-function-descriptions.md#function_last-value), and two instances
of [`NTH_VALUE()`](window-function-descriptions.md#function_nth-value):

```sql
mysql> SELECT
         time, subject, val,
         FIRST_VALUE(val)  OVER w AS 'first',
         LAST_VALUE(val)   OVER w AS 'last',
         NTH_VALUE(val, 2) OVER w AS 'second',
         NTH_VALUE(val, 4) OVER w AS 'fourth'
       FROM observations
       WINDOW w AS (PARTITION BY subject ORDER BY time
                    ROWS UNBOUNDED PRECEDING);
+----------+---------+------+-------+------+--------+--------+
| time     | subject | val  | first | last | second | fourth |
+----------+---------+------+-------+------+--------+--------+
| 07:00:00 | st113   |   10 |    10 |   10 |   NULL |   NULL |
| 07:15:00 | st113   |    9 |    10 |    9 |      9 |   NULL |
| 07:30:00 | st113   |   25 |    10 |   25 |      9 |   NULL |
| 07:45:00 | st113   |   20 |    10 |   20 |      9 |     20 |
| 07:00:00 | xh458   |    0 |     0 |    0 |   NULL |   NULL |
| 07:15:00 | xh458   |   10 |     0 |   10 |     10 |   NULL |
| 07:30:00 | xh458   |    5 |     0 |    5 |     10 |   NULL |
| 07:45:00 | xh458   |   30 |     0 |   30 |     10 |     30 |
| 08:00:00 | xh458   |   25 |     0 |   25 |     10 |     30 |
+----------+---------+------+-------+------+--------+--------+
```

Each function uses the rows in the current frame, which, per the
window definition shown, extends from the first partition row to
the current row. For the
[`NTH_VALUE()`](window-function-descriptions.md#function_nth-value) calls, the current
frame does not always include the requested row; in such cases,
the return value is `NULL`.

In the absence of a frame clause, the default frame depends on
whether an `ORDER BY` clause is present:

- With `ORDER BY`: The default frame includes
  rows from the partition start through the current row,
  including all peers of the current row (rows equal to the
  current row according to the `ORDER BY`
  clause). The default is equivalent to this frame
  specification:

  ```sql
  RANGE BETWEEN UNBOUNDED PRECEDING AND CURRENT ROW
  ```
- Without `ORDER BY`: The default frame
  includes all partition rows (because, without `ORDER
  BY`, all partition rows are peers). The default is
  equivalent to this frame specification:

  ```sql
  RANGE BETWEEN UNBOUNDED PRECEDING AND UNBOUNDED FOLLOWING
  ```

Because the default frame differs depending on presence or
absence of `ORDER BY`, adding `ORDER
BY` to a query to get deterministic results may change
the results. (For example, the values produced by
[`SUM()`](aggregate-functions.md#function_sum) might change.) To obtain
the same results but ordered per `ORDER BY`,
provide an explicit frame specification to be used regardless of
whether `ORDER BY` is present.

The meaning of a frame specification can be nonobvious when the
current row value is `NULL`. Assuming that to
be the case, these examples illustrate how various frame
specifications apply:

- `ORDER BY X ASC RANGE BETWEEN 10 FOLLOWING AND 15
  FOLLOWING`

  The frame starts at `NULL` and stops at
  `NULL`, thus includes only rows with value
  `NULL`.
- `ORDER BY X ASC RANGE BETWEEN 10 FOLLOWING AND
  UNBOUNDED FOLLOWING`

  The frame starts at `NULL` and stops at the
  end of the partition. Because an `ASC` sort
  puts `NULL` values first, the frame is the
  entire partition.
- `ORDER BY X DESC RANGE BETWEEN 10 FOLLOWING AND
  UNBOUNDED FOLLOWING`

  The frame starts at `NULL` and stops at the
  end of the partition. Because a `DESC` sort
  puts `NULL` values last, the frame is only
  the `NULL` values.
- `ORDER BY X ASC RANGE BETWEEN 10 PRECEDING AND
  UNBOUNDED FOLLOWING`

  The frame starts at `NULL` and stops at the
  end of the partition. Because an `ASC` sort
  puts `NULL` values first, the frame is the
  entire partition.
- `ORDER BY X ASC RANGE BETWEEN 10 PRECEDING AND 10
  FOLLOWING`

  The frame starts at `NULL` and stops at
  `NULL`, thus includes only rows with value
  `NULL`.
- `ORDER BY X ASC RANGE BETWEEN 10 PRECEDING AND 1
  PRECEDING`

  The frame starts at `NULL` and stops at
  `NULL`, thus includes only rows with value
  `NULL`.
- `ORDER BY X ASC RANGE BETWEEN UNBOUNDED PRECEDING
  AND 10 FOLLOWING`

  The frame starts at the beginning of the partition and stops
  at rows with value `NULL`. Because an
  `ASC` sort puts `NULL`
  values first, the frame is only the `NULL`
  values.
