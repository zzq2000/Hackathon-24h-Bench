#### 6.2.2.4 Program Option Modifiers

Some options are “boolean” and control behavior
that can be turned on or off. For example, the
[**mysql**](mysql.md "6.5.1 mysql — The MySQL Command-Line Client") client supports a
[`--column-names`](mysql-command-options.md#option_mysql_column-names) option that
determines whether or not to display a row of column names at
the beginning of query results. By default, this option is
enabled. However, you may want to disable it in some instances,
such as when sending the output of [**mysql**](mysql.md "6.5.1 mysql — The MySQL Command-Line Client") into
another program that expects to see only data and not an initial
header line.

To disable column names, you can specify the option using any of
these forms:

```terminal
--disable-column-names
--skip-column-names
--column-names=0
```

The `--disable` and `--skip`
prefixes and the `=0` suffix all have the same
effect: They turn the option off.

The “enabled” form of the option may be specified
in any of these ways:

```terminal
--column-names
--enable-column-names
--column-names=1
```

The values `ON`, `TRUE`,
`OFF`, and `FALSE` are also
recognized for boolean options (not case-sensitive).

If an option is prefixed by `--loose`, a program
does not exit with an error if it does not recognize the option,
but instead issues only a warning:

```terminal
$> mysql --loose-no-such-option
mysql: WARNING: unknown option '--loose-no-such-option'
```

The `--loose` prefix can be useful when you run
programs from multiple installations of MySQL on the same
machine and list options in an option file. An option that may
not be recognized by all versions of a program can be given
using the `--loose` prefix (or
`loose` in an option file). Versions of the
program that recognize the option process it normally, and
versions that do not recognize it issue a warning and ignore it.

The `--maximum` prefix is available for
[**mysqld**](mysqld.md "6.3.1 mysqld — The MySQL Server") only and permits a limit to be placed
on how large client programs can set session system variables.
To do this, use a `--maximum` prefix with the
variable name. For example,
`--maximum-max_heap_table_size=32M` prevents any
client from making the heap table size limit larger than 32M.

The `--maximum` prefix is intended for use with
system variables that have a session value. If applied to a
system variable that has only a global value, an error occurs.
For example, with `--maximum-back_log=200`, the
server produces this error:

```none
Maximum value of 'back_log' cannot be set
```
