### 2.5.9 Managing MySQL Server with systemd

If you install MySQL using an RPM or Debian package on the
following Linux platforms, server startup and shutdown is managed
by systemd:

- RPM package platforms:

  - Enterprise Linux variants version 7 and higher
  - SUSE Linux Enterprise Server 12 and higher
  - Fedora 29 and higher
- Debian family platforms:

  - Debian platforms
  - Ubuntu platforms

If you install MySQL from a generic binary distribution on a
platform that uses systemd, you can manually configure systemd
support for MySQL following the instructions provided in the
post-installation setup section of the
[MySQL
Secure Deployment Guide](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/mysql-secure-deployment-guide/en/).

If you install MySQL from a source distribution on a platform that
uses systemd, obtain systemd support for MySQL by configuring the
distribution using the
[`-DWITH_SYSTEMD=1`](source-configuration-options.md#option_cmake_with_systemd)
**CMake** option. See
[Section 2.8.7, “MySQL Source-Configuration Options”](source-configuration-options.md "2.8.7 MySQL Source-Configuration Options").

The following discussion covers these topics:

- [Overview of systemd](using-systemd.md#systemd-overview "Overview of systemd")
- [Configuring systemd for MySQL](using-systemd.md#systemd-mysql-configuration "Configuring systemd for MySQL")
- [Configuring Multiple MySQL Instances Using systemd](using-systemd.md#systemd-multiple-mysql-instances "Configuring Multiple MySQL Instances Using systemd")
- [Migrating from mysqld\_safe to systemd](using-systemd.md#mysqld-safe-to-systemd-migration "Migrating from mysqld_safe to systemd")

Note

On platforms for which systemd support for MySQL is installed,
scripts such as [**mysqld\_safe**](mysqld-safe.md "6.3.2 mysqld_safe — MySQL Server Startup Script") and the System V
initialization script are unnecessary and are not installed. For
example, [**mysqld\_safe**](mysqld-safe.md "6.3.2 mysqld_safe — MySQL Server Startup Script") can handle server
restarts, but systemd provides the same capability, and does so
in a manner consistent with management of other services rather
than by using an application-specific program.

One implication of the non-use of [**mysqld\_safe**](mysqld-safe.md "6.3.2 mysqld_safe — MySQL Server Startup Script")
on platforms that use systemd for server management is that use
of `[mysqld_safe]` or
`[safe_mysqld]` sections in option files is not
supported and might lead to unexpected behavior.

Because systemd has the capability of managing multiple MySQL
instances on platforms for which systemd support for MySQL is
installed, [**mysqld\_multi**](mysqld-multi.md "6.3.4 mysqld_multi — Manage Multiple MySQL Servers") and
**mysqld\_multi.server** are unnecessary and are
not installed.

#### Overview of systemd

systemd provides automatic MySQL server startup and shutdown. It
also enables manual server management using the
**systemctl** command. For example:

```terminal
$> systemctl {start|stop|restart|status} mysqld
```

Alternatively, use the **service** command (with
the arguments reversed), which is compatible with System V
systems:

```terminal
$> service mysqld {start|stop|restart|status}
```

Note

For the **systemctl** command (and the
alternative **service** command), if the MySQL
service name is not `mysqld` then use the
appropriate name. For example, use `mysql`
rather than `mysqld` on Debian-based and SLES
systems.

Support for systemd includes these files:

- `mysqld.service` (RPM platforms),
  `mysql.service` (Debian platforms):
  systemd service unit configuration file, with details about
  the MySQL service.
- `mysqld@.service` (RPM platforms),
  `mysql@.service` (Debian platforms): Like
  `mysqld.service` or
  `mysql.service`, but used for managing
  multiple MySQL instances.
- `mysqld.tmpfiles.d`: File containing
  information to support the `tmpfiles`
  feature. This file is installed under the name
  `mysql.conf`.
- `mysqld_pre_systemd` (RPM platforms),
  `mysql-system-start` (Debian platforms):
  Support script for the unit file. This script assists in
  creating the error log file only if the log location matches
  a pattern (`/var/log/mysql*.log` for RPM
  platforms, `/var/log/mysql/*.log` for
  Debian platforms). In other cases, the error log directory
  must be writable or the error log must be present and
  writable for the user running the [**mysqld**](mysqld.md "6.3.1 mysqld — The MySQL Server")
  process.

#### Configuring systemd for MySQL

To add or change systemd options for MySQL, these methods are
available:

- Use a localized systemd configuration file.
- Arrange for systemd to set environment variables for the
  MySQL server process.
- Set the `MYSQLD_OPTS` systemd variable.

To use a localized systemd configuration file, create the
`/etc/systemd/system/mysqld.service.d`
directory if it does not exist. In that directory, create a file
that contains a `[Service]` section listing the
desired settings. For example:

```ini
[Service]
LimitNOFILE=max_open_files
Nice=nice_level
LimitCore=core_file_limit
Environment="LD_PRELOAD=/path/to/malloc/library"
Environment="TZ=time_zone_setting"
```

The discussion here uses `override.conf` as
the name of this file. Newer versions of systemd support the
following command, which opens an editor and permits you to edit
the file:

```terminal
systemctl edit mysqld  # RPM platforms
systemctl edit mysql   # Debian platforms
```

Whenever you create or change
`override.conf`, reload the systemd
configuration, then tell systemd to restart the MySQL service:

```terminal
systemctl daemon-reload
systemctl restart mysqld  # RPM platforms
systemctl restart mysql   # Debian platforms
```

With systemd, the `override.conf`
configuration method must be used for certain parameters, rather
than settings in a `[mysqld]`,
`[mysqld_safe]`, or
`[safe_mysqld]` group in a MySQL option file:

- For some parameters, `override.conf` must
  be used because systemd itself must know their values and it
  cannot read MySQL option files to get them.
- Parameters that specify values otherwise settable only using
  options known to [**mysqld\_safe**](mysqld-safe.md "6.3.2 mysqld_safe — MySQL Server Startup Script") must be
  specified using systemd because there is no corresponding
  [**mysqld**](mysqld.md "6.3.1 mysqld — The MySQL Server") parameter.

For additional information about using systemd rather than
[**mysqld\_safe**](mysqld-safe.md "6.3.2 mysqld_safe — MySQL Server Startup Script"), see
[Migrating from mysqld\_safe to systemd](using-systemd.md#mysqld-safe-to-systemd-migration "Migrating from mysqld_safe to systemd").

You can set the following parameters in
`override.conf`:

- To set the number of file descriptors available to the MySQL
  server, use `LimitNOFILE` in
  `override.conf` rather than the
  [`open_files_limit`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_open_files_limit) system
  variable for [**mysqld**](mysqld.md "6.3.1 mysqld — The MySQL Server") or
  [`--open-files-limit`](mysqld-safe.md#option_mysqld_safe_open-files-limit)
  option for [**mysqld\_safe**](mysqld-safe.md "6.3.2 mysqld_safe — MySQL Server Startup Script").
- To set the maximum core file size, use
  `LimitCore` in
  `override.conf` rather than the
  [`--core-file-size`](mysqld-safe.md#option_mysqld_safe_core-file-size) option
  for [**mysqld\_safe**](mysqld-safe.md "6.3.2 mysqld_safe — MySQL Server Startup Script").
- To set the scheduling priority for the MySQL server, use
  `Nice` in
  `override.conf` rather than the
  [`--nice`](mysqld-safe.md#option_mysqld_safe_nice) option for
  [**mysqld\_safe**](mysqld-safe.md "6.3.2 mysqld_safe — MySQL Server Startup Script").

Some MySQL parameters are configured using environment
variables:

- `LD_PRELOAD`: Set this variable if the
  MySQL server should use a specific memory-allocation
  library.
- `NOTIFY_SOCKET`: This environment variable
  specifies the socket that [**mysqld**](mysqld.md "6.3.1 mysqld — The MySQL Server") uses to
  communicate notification of startup completion and service
  status change with systemd. It is set by systemd when the
  [**mysqld**](mysqld.md "6.3.1 mysqld — The MySQL Server") service is started. The
  [**mysqld**](mysqld.md "6.3.1 mysqld — The MySQL Server") service reads the variable setting
  and writes to the defined location.

  In MySQL 8.0, [**mysqld**](mysqld.md "6.3.1 mysqld — The MySQL Server") uses
  the `Type=notify` process startup type.
  (`Type=forking` was used in MySQL 5.7.)
  With `Type=notify`, systemd automatically
  configures a socket file and exports the path to the
  `NOTIFY_SOCKET` environment variable.
- `TZ`: Set this variable to specify the
  default time zone for the server.

There are multiple ways to specify environment variable values
for use by the MySQL server process managed by systemd:

- Use `Environment` lines in the
  `override.conf` file. For the syntax, see
  the example in the preceding discussion that describes how
  to use this file.
- Specify the values in the
  `/etc/sysconfig/mysql` file (create the
  file if it does not exist). Assign values using the
  following syntax:

  ```ini
  LD_PRELOAD=/path/to/malloc/library
  TZ=time_zone_setting
  ```

  After modifying `/etc/sysconfig/mysql`,
  restart the server to make the changes effective:

  ```terminal
  systemctl restart mysqld  # RPM platforms
  systemctl restart mysql   # Debian platforms
  ```

To specify options for [**mysqld**](mysqld.md "6.3.1 mysqld — The MySQL Server") without
modifying systemd configuration files directly, set or unset the
`MYSQLD_OPTS` systemd variable. For example:

```terminal
systemctl set-environment MYSQLD_OPTS="--general_log=1"
systemctl unset-environment MYSQLD_OPTS
```

`MYSQLD_OPTS` can also be set in the
`/etc/sysconfig/mysql` file.

After modifying the systemd environment, restart the server to
make the changes effective:

```terminal
systemctl restart mysqld  # RPM platforms
systemctl restart mysql   # Debian platforms
```

For platforms that use systemd, the data directory is
initialized if empty at server startup. This might be a problem
if the data directory is a remote mount that has temporarily
disappeared: The mount point would appear to be an empty data
directory, which then would be initialized as a new data
directory. To suppress this automatic initialization behavior,
specify the following line in the
`/etc/sysconfig/mysql` file (create the file
if it does not exist):

```ini
NO_INIT=true
```

#### Configuring Multiple MySQL Instances Using systemd

This section describes how to configure systemd for multiple
instances of MySQL.

Note

Because systemd has the capability of managing multiple MySQL
instances on platforms for which systemd support is installed,
[**mysqld\_multi**](mysqld-multi.md "6.3.4 mysqld_multi — Manage Multiple MySQL Servers") and
**mysqld\_multi.server** are unnecessary and are
not installed.

To use multiple-instance capability, modify the
`my.cnf` option file to include configuration
of key options for each instance. These file locations are
typical:

- `/etc/my.cnf` or
  `/etc/mysql/my.cnf` (RPM platforms)
- `/etc/mysql/mysql.conf.d/mysqld.cnf`
  (Debian platforms)

For example, to manage two instances named
`replica01` and `replica02`,
add something like this to the option file:

RPM platforms:

```ini
[mysqld@replica01]
datadir=/var/lib/mysql-replica01
socket=/var/lib/mysql-replica01/mysql.sock
port=3307
log-error=/var/log/mysqld-replica01.log

[mysqld@replica02]
datadir=/var/lib/mysql-replica02
socket=/var/lib/mysql-replica02/mysql.sock
port=3308
log-error=/var/log/mysqld-replica02.log
```

Debian platforms:

```ini
[mysqld@replica01]
datadir=/var/lib/mysql-replica01
socket=/var/lib/mysql-replica01/mysql.sock
port=3307
log-error=/var/log/mysql/replica01.log

[mysqld@replica02]
datadir=/var/lib/mysql-replica02
socket=/var/lib/mysql-replica02/mysql.sock
port=3308
log-error=/var/log/mysql/replica02.log
```

The replica names shown here use `@` as the
delimiter because that is the only delimiter supported by
systemd.

Instances then are managed by normal systemd commands, such as:

```terminal
systemctl start mysqld@replica01
systemctl start mysqld@replica02
```

To enable instances to run at boot time, do this:

```terminal
systemctl enable mysqld@replica01
systemctl enable mysqld@replica02
```

Use of wildcards is also supported. For example, this command
displays the status of all replica instances:

```terminal
systemctl status 'mysqld@replica*'
```

For management of multiple MySQL instances on the same machine,
systemd automatically uses a different unit file:

- `mysqld@.service` rather than
  `mysqld.service` (RPM platforms)
- `mysql@.service` rather than
  `mysql.service` (Debian platforms)

In the unit file, `%I` and
`%i` reference the parameter passed in after
the `@` marker and are used to manage the
specific instance. For a command such as this:

```terminal
systemctl start mysqld@replica01
```

systemd starts the server using a command such as this:

```terminal
mysqld --defaults-group-suffix=@%I ...
```

The result is that the `[server]`,
`[mysqld]`, and
`[mysqld@replica01]` option groups are read and
used for that instance of the service.

Note

On Debian platforms, AppArmor prevents the server from reading
or writing `/var/lib/mysql-replica*`, or
anything other than the default locations. To address this,
you must customize or disable the profile in
`/etc/apparmor.d/usr.sbin.mysqld`.

Note

On Debian platforms, the packaging scripts for MySQL
uninstallation cannot currently handle
`mysqld@` instances. Before removing or
upgrading the package, you must stop any extra instances
manually first.

#### Migrating from mysqld\_safe to systemd

Because [**mysqld\_safe**](mysqld-safe.md "6.3.2 mysqld_safe — MySQL Server Startup Script") is not installed on
platforms that use systemd to manage MySQL, options previously
specified for that program (for example, in an
`[mysqld_safe]` or
`[safe_mysqld]` option group) must be specified
another way:

- Some [**mysqld\_safe**](mysqld-safe.md "6.3.2 mysqld_safe — MySQL Server Startup Script") options are also
  understood by [**mysqld**](mysqld.md "6.3.1 mysqld — The MySQL Server") and can be moved
  from the `[mysqld_safe]` or
  `[safe_mysqld]` option group to the
  `[mysqld]` group. This does
  *not* include
  [`--pid-file`](mysqld-safe.md#option_mysqld_safe_pid-file),
  [`--open-files-limit`](mysqld-safe.md#option_mysqld_safe_open-files-limit), or
  [`--nice`](mysqld-safe.md#option_mysqld_safe_nice). To specify those
  options, use the `override.conf` systemd
  file, described previously.

  Note

  On systemd platforms, use of
  `[mysqld_safe]` and
  `[safe_mysqld]` option groups is not
  supported and may lead to unexpected behavior.
- For some [**mysqld\_safe**](mysqld-safe.md "6.3.2 mysqld_safe — MySQL Server Startup Script") options, there are
  alternative [**mysqld**](mysqld.md "6.3.1 mysqld — The MySQL Server") procedures. For
  example, the [**mysqld\_safe**](mysqld-safe.md "6.3.2 mysqld_safe — MySQL Server Startup Script") option for
  enabling `syslog` logging is
  [`--syslog`](mysqld-safe.md#option_mysqld_safe_syslog), which is
  deprecated. To write error log output to the system log, use
  the instructions at [Section 7.4.2.8, “Error Logging to the System Log”](error-log-syslog.md "7.4.2.8 Error Logging to the System Log").
- [**mysqld\_safe**](mysqld-safe.md "6.3.2 mysqld_safe — MySQL Server Startup Script") options not understood by
  [**mysqld**](mysqld.md "6.3.1 mysqld — The MySQL Server") can be specified in
  `override.conf` or environment variables.
  For example, with [**mysqld\_safe**](mysqld-safe.md "6.3.2 mysqld_safe — MySQL Server Startup Script"), if the
  server should use a specific memory allocation library, this
  is specified using the
  [`--malloc-lib`](mysqld-safe.md#option_mysqld_safe_malloc-lib) option. For
  installations that manage the server with systemd, arrange
  to set the `LD_PRELOAD` environment
  variable instead, as described previously.
