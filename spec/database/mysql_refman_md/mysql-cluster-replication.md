NDB Cluster supports asynchronous
replication, more usually referred to simply as
“replication”. This section explains how to set up and
manage a configuration in which one group of computers operating as
an NDB Cluster replicates to a second computer or group of
computers. We assume some familiarity on the part of the reader with
standard MySQL replication as discussed elsewhere in this Manual.
(See [Chapter 19, *Replication*](replication.md "Chapter 19 Replication")).

Note

NDB Cluster does not support replication using GTIDs;
semisynchronous replication and group replication are also not
supported by the `NDB` storage engine.

Normal (non-clustered) replication involves a source server and a
replica server, the source being so named because operations and
data to be replicated originate with it, and the replica being the
recipient of these. In NDB Cluster, replication is conceptually very
similar but can be more complex in practice, as it may be extended
to cover a number of different configurations including replicating
between two complete clusters. Although an NDB Cluster itself
depends on the [`NDB`](mysql-cluster.md "Chapter 25 MySQL NDB Cluster 8.0") storage engine for
clustering functionality, it is not necessary to use
[`NDB`](mysql-cluster.md "Chapter 25 MySQL NDB Cluster 8.0") as the storage engine for the
replica's copies of the replicated tables (see
[Replication from NDB to other storage engines](mysql-cluster-replication-issues.md#mysql-cluster-replication-ndb-to-non-ndb "Replication from NDB to other storage engines")).
However, for maximum availability, it is possible (and preferable)
to replicate from one NDB Cluster to another, and it is this
scenario that we discuss, as shown in the following figure:

**Figure 25.10 NDB Cluster-to-Cluster Replication Layout**

![Much of the content is described in the surrounding text. It visualizes how a MySQL source is replicated. The replica differs in that it shows an I/O (receiver) thread pointing to a relay binary log which points to an SQL (applier) thread. In addition, while the binary log points to and from the NDBCLUSTER engine on the source server, on the replica it points directly to an SQL node (MySQL server).](images/cluster-replication-overview.png)

In this scenario, the replication process is one in which successive
states of a source cluster are logged and saved to a replica
cluster. This process is accomplished by a special thread known as
the NDB binary log injector thread, which runs on each MySQL server
and produces a binary log (`binlog`). This thread
ensures that all changes in the cluster producing the binary
log—and not just those changes that are effected through the
MySQL Server—are inserted into the binary log with the correct
serialization order. We refer to the MySQL source and replica
servers as replication servers or replication nodes, and the data
flow or line of communication between them as a
replication channel.

For information about performing point-in-time recovery with NDB
Cluster and NDB Cluster Replication, see
[Section 25.7.9.2, “Point-In-Time Recovery Using NDB Cluster Replication”](mysql-cluster-replication-pitr.md "25.7.9.2 Point-In-Time Recovery Using NDB Cluster Replication").

**NDB API replica status variables.**
NDB API counters can provide enhanced monitoring capabilities on
replica clusters. These counters are implemented as NDB statistics
`_slave` status variables, as seen in the output
of [`SHOW STATUS`](show-status.md "15.7.7.37 SHOW STATUS Statement"), or in the results
of queries against the Performance Schema
[`session_status`](performance-schema-status-variable-tables.md "29.12.15 Performance Schema Status Variable Tables") or
[`global_status`](performance-schema-status-variable-tables.md "29.12.15 Performance Schema Status Variable Tables") table in a
[**mysql**](mysql.md "6.5.1 mysql — The MySQL Command-Line Client") client session connected to a MySQL
Server that is acting as a replica in NDB Cluster Replication. By
comparing the values of these status variables before and after
the execution of statements affecting replicated
[`NDB`](mysql-cluster.md "Chapter 25 MySQL NDB Cluster 8.0") tables, you can observe the
corresponding actions taken on the NDB API level by the replica,
which can be useful when monitoring or troubleshooting NDB Cluster
Replication. [Section 25.6.15, “NDB API Statistics Counters and Variables”](mysql-cluster-ndb-api-statistics.md "25.6.15 NDB API Statistics Counters and Variables"),
provides additional information.

**Replication from NDB to non-NDB tables.**
It is possible to replicate [`NDB`](mysql-cluster.md "Chapter 25 MySQL NDB Cluster 8.0")
tables from an NDB Cluster acting as the replication source to
tables using other MySQL storage engines such as
[`InnoDB`](innodb-storage-engine.md "Chapter 17 The InnoDB Storage Engine") or
[`MyISAM`](myisam-storage-engine.md "18.2 The MyISAM Storage Engine") on a replica
[**mysqld**](mysqld.md "6.3.1 mysqld — The MySQL Server"). This is subject to a number of
conditions; see
[Replication from NDB to other storage engines](mysql-cluster-replication-issues.md#mysql-cluster-replication-ndb-to-non-ndb "Replication from NDB to other storage engines"), and
[Replication from NDB to a nontransactional storage engine](mysql-cluster-replication-issues.md#mysql-cluster-replication-ndb-to-nontransactional "Replication from NDB to a nontransactional storage engine"),
