#### 19.1.2.4 Obtaining the Replication Source Binary Log Coordinates

To configure the replica to start the replication process at the
correct point, you need to note the source's current coordinates
within its binary log.

Warning

This procedure uses [`FLUSH TABLES WITH
READ LOCK`](flush.md#flush-tables-with-read-lock), which blocks
[`COMMIT`](commit.md "15.3.1 START TRANSACTION, COMMIT, and ROLLBACK Statements") operations for
[`InnoDB`](innodb-storage-engine.md "Chapter 17 The InnoDB Storage Engine") tables.

If you are planning to shut down the source to create a data
snapshot, you can optionally skip this procedure and instead
store a copy of the binary log index file along with the data
snapshot. In that situation, the source creates a new binary log
file on restart. The source binary log coordinates where the
replica must start the replication process are therefore the
start of that new file, which is the next binary log file on the
source following after the files that are listed in the copied
binary log index file.

To obtain the source binary log coordinates, follow these steps:

1. Start a session on the source by connecting to it with the
   command-line client, and flush all tables and block write
   statements by executing the [`FLUSH
   TABLES WITH READ LOCK`](flush.md#flush-tables-with-read-lock) statement:

   ```sql
   mysql> FLUSH TABLES WITH READ LOCK;
   ```

   Warning

   Leave the client from which you issued the
   [`FLUSH TABLES`](flush.md#flush-tables) statement
   running so that the read lock remains in effect. If you
   exit the client, the lock is released.
2. In a different session on the source, use the
   [`SHOW MASTER STATUS`](show-master-status.md "15.7.7.23 SHOW MASTER STATUS Statement") statement
   to determine the current binary log file name and position:

   ```sql
   mysql> SHOW MASTER STATUS\G
   *************************** 1. row ***************************
                File: mysql-bin.000003
            Position: 73
        Binlog_Do_DB: test
    Binlog_Ignore_DB: manual, mysql
   Executed_Gtid_Set: 3E11FA47-71CA-11E1-9E33-C80AA9429562:1-5
   1 row in set (0.00 sec)
   ```

   The `File` column shows the name of the log
   file and the `Position` column shows the
   position within the file. In this example, the binary log
   file is `mysql-bin.000003` and the position
   is 73. Record these values. You need them later when you are
   setting up the replica. They represent the replication
   coordinates at which the replica should begin processing new
   updates from the source.

   If the source has been running previously with binary
   logging disabled, the log file name and position values
   displayed by [`SHOW MASTER
   STATUS`](show-master-status.md "15.7.7.23 SHOW MASTER STATUS Statement") or [**mysqldump
   --master-data**](mysqldump.md "6.5.4 mysqldump — A Database Backup Program") are empty. In that case, the values
   that you need to use later when specifying the source's
   binary log file and position are the empty string
   (`''`) and `4`.

You now have the information you need to enable the replica to
start reading from the source's binary log in the correct place
to start replication.

The next step depends on whether you have existing data on the
source. Choose one of the following options:

- If you have existing data that needs be to synchronized with
  the replica before you start replication, leave the client
  running so that the lock remains in place. This prevents any
  further changes being made, so that the data copied to the
  replica is in synchrony with the source. Proceed to
  [Section 19.1.2.5, “Choosing a Method for Data Snapshots”](replication-snapshot-method.md "19.1.2.5 Choosing a Method for Data Snapshots").
- If you are setting up a new source and replica combination,
  you can exit the first session to release the read lock. See
  [Section 19.1.2.6.1, “Setting Up Replication with New Source and Replicas”](replication-setup-replicas.md#replication-howto-newservers "19.1.2.6.1 Setting Up Replication with New Source and Replicas") for how to
  proceed.
