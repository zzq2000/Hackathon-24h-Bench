### 14.18.3 Asynchronous Replication Channel Failover Functions

The following functions, which are available from MySQL 8.0.22
for standard source to replica replication and from MySQL 8.0.23
for Group Replication, enable you to add and remove replication
source servers from the source list for a replication channel.
From MySQL 8.0.27, you can also clear the source list for a
server.

**Table 14.27 Failover Channel Functions**

| Name | Description | Introduced |
| --- | --- | --- |
| [`asynchronous_connection_failover_add_managed()`](replication-functions-async-failover.md#function_asynchronous-connection-failover-add-managed) | Add group member source server configuration information to a replication channel source list | 8.0.23 |
| [`asynchronous_connection_failover_add_source()`](replication-functions-async-failover.md#function_asynchronous-connection-failover-add-source) | Add source server configuration information server to a replication channel source list | 8.0.22 |
| [`asynchronous_connection_failover_delete_managed()`](replication-functions-async-failover.md#function_asynchronous-connection-failover-delete-managed) | Remove a managed group from a replication channel source list | 8.0.23 |
| [`asynchronous_connection_failover_delete_source()`](replication-functions-async-failover.md#function_asynchronous-connection-failover-delete-source) | Remove a source server from a replication channel source list | 8.0.22 |

The asynchronous connection failover mechanism automatically
establishes an asynchronous (source to replica) replication
connection to a new source from the appropriate list after the
existing connection from the replica to its source fails. From
MySQL 8.0.23, the connection is also changed if the currently
connected source does not have the highest weighted priority in
the group. For Group Replication source servers that are defined
as part of a managed group, the connection is also failed over
to another group member if the currently connected source leaves
the group or is no longer in the majority. For more information
on the mechanism, see
[Section 19.4.9, “Switching Sources and Replicas with Asynchronous Connection Failover”](replication-asynchronous-connection-failover.md "19.4.9 Switching Sources and Replicas with Asynchronous Connection Failover").

Source lists are stored in the
`mysql.replication_asynchronous_connection_failover`
and
`mysql.replication_asynchronous_connection_failover_managed`
tables, and can be viewed in the Performance Schema
[`replication_asynchronous_connection_failover`](performance-schema-replication-asynchronous-connection-failover-table.md "29.12.11.8 The replication_asynchronous_connection_failover Table")
table.

If the replication channel is on a Group Replication primary for
a group where failover between replicas is active, the source
list is broadcast to all the group members when they join or
when it is updated by any method. Failover between replicas is
controlled by the
`mysql_start_failover_channels_if_primary`
member action, which is enabled by default, and can be disabled
using the
[`group_replication_disable_member_action`](group-replication-functions-for-member-actions.md#function_group-replication-disable-member-action)
function.

- [`asynchronous_connection_failover_add_managed()`](replication-functions-async-failover.md#function_asynchronous-connection-failover-add-managed)

  Add configuration information for a replication source
  server that is part of a managed group (a Group Replication
  group member) to the source list for a replication channel.
  You only need to add one group member. The replica
  automatically adds the rest from the current group
  membership, then keeps the source list updated in line with
  membership change.

  Syntax:

  ```clike
  asynchronous_connection_failover_add_managed(channel, managed_type, managed_name, host, port, network_namespace, primary_weight, secondary_weight)
  ```

  Arguments:

  - *`channel`*: The replication
    channel for which this replication source server is part
    of the source list.
  - *`managed_type`*: The type of
    managed service that the asynchronous connection
    failover mechanism must provide for this server. The
    only value currently accepted is
    `GroupReplication`.
  - *`managed_name`*: The identifier
    for the managed group that the server is a part of. For
    the `GroupReplication` managed service,
    the identifier is the value of the
    [`group_replication_group_name`](group-replication-system-variables.md#sysvar_group_replication_group_name)
    system variable.
  - *`host`*: The host name for this
    replication source server.
  - *`port`*: The port number for
    this replication source server.
  - *`network_namespace`*: The
    network namespace for this replication source server.
    Specify an empty string, as this parameter is reserved
    for future use.
  - *`primary_weight`*: The priority
    of this replication source server in the replication
    channel's source list when it is acting as the primary
    for the managed group. The weight is from 1 to 100, with
    100 being the highest. For the primary, 80 is a suitable
    weight. The asynchronous connection failover mechanism
    activates if the currently connected source is not the
    highest weighted in the group. Assuming that you set up
    the managed group to give a higher weight to a primary
    and a lower weight to a secondary, when the primary
    changes, its weight increases, and the replica changes
    over the connection to it.
  - *`secondary_weight`*: The
    priority of this replication source server in the
    replication channel's source list when it is acting as a
    secondary in the managed group. The weight is from 1 to
    100, with 100 being the highest. For a secondary, 60 is
    a suitable weight.

  Return value:

  A string containing the result of the operation, for example
  whether it was successful or not.

  Example:

  ```sql
  SELECT asynchronous_connection_failover_add_managed('channel2', 'GroupReplication', 'aaaaaaaa-aaaa-aaaa-aaaa-aaaaaaaaaaaa', '127.0.0.1', 3310, '', 80, 60);
  +----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
  | asynchronous_connection_failover_add_source('channel2', 'GroupReplication', 'aaaaaaaa-aaaa-aaaa-aaaa-aaaaaaaaaaaa', '127.0.0.1', 3310, '', 80, 60) |
  +----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
  | Source managed configuration details successfully inserted.                                                                                        |
  +----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
  ```

  For more information, see
  [Section 19.4.9, “Switching Sources and Replicas with Asynchronous Connection Failover”](replication-asynchronous-connection-failover.md "19.4.9 Switching Sources and Replicas with Asynchronous Connection Failover").
- [`asynchronous_connection_failover_add_source()`](replication-functions-async-failover.md#function_asynchronous-connection-failover-add-source)

  Add configuration information for a replication source
  server to the source list for a replication channel.

  Syntax:

  ```clike
  asynchronous_connection_failover_add_source(channel, host, port, network_namespace, weight)
  ```

  Arguments:

  - *`channel`*: The replication
    channel for which this replication source server is part
    of the source list.
  - *`host`*: The host name for this
    replication source server.
  - *`port`*: The port number for
    this replication source server.
  - *`network_namespace`*: The
    network namespace for this replication source server.
    Specify an empty string, as this parameter is reserved
    for future use.
  - *`weight`*: The priority of this
    replication source server in the replication channel's
    source list. The priority is from 1 to 100, with 100
    being the highest, and 50 being the default. When the
    asynchronous connection failover mechanism activates,
    the source with the highest priority setting among the
    alternative sources listed in the source list for the
    channel is chosen for the first connection attempt. If
    this attempt does not work, the replica tries with all
    the listed sources in descending order of priority, then
    starts again from the highest priority source. If
    multiple sources have the same priority, the replica
    orders them randomly. From MySQL 8.0.23, the
    asynchronous connection failover mechanism activates if
    the source currently connected is not the highest
    weighted in the group.

  Return value:

  A string containing the result of the operation, for example
  whether it was successful or not.

  Example:

  ```sql
  SELECT asynchronous_connection_failover_add_source('channel2', '127.0.0.1', 3310, '', 80);
  +-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
  | asynchronous_connection_failover_add_source('channel2', '127.0.0.1', 3310, '', 80)              |
  +-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
  | Source configuration details successfully inserted.                                             |
  +-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
  ```

- [`asynchronous_connection_failover_delete_managed()`](replication-functions-async-failover.md#function_asynchronous-connection-failover-delete-managed)

  Remove an entire managed group from the source list for a
  replication channel. When you use this function, all the
  replication source servers defined in the managed group are
  removed from the channel's source list.

    channel for which this replication source server was
    part of the source list.
  - *`managed_name`*: The identifier
    for the managed group that the server is a part of. For
    the `GroupReplication` managed service,
    the identifier is the value of the
    [`group_replication_group_name`](group-replication-system-variables.md#sysvar_group_replication_group_name)
    system variable.

  Return value:

  A string containing the result of the operation, for example
  whether it was successful or not.
