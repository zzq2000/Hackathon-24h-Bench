### 5.6.6 Using Foreign Keys

MySQL supports foreign keys, which permit cross-referencing
related data across tables, and foreign key constraints, which
help keep the related data consistent.

A foreign key relationship involves a parent table that holds
the initial column values, and a child table with column values
that reference the parent column values. A foreign key
constraint is defined on the child table.

This following example relates `parent` and
`child` tables through a single-column foreign
key and shows how a foreign key constraint enforces referential
integrity.

Create the parent and child tables using the following SQL
statements:

```sql
CREATE TABLE parent (
    id INT NOT NULL,
    PRIMARY KEY (id)
) ENGINE=INNODB;

CREATE TABLE child (
    id INT,
    parent_id INT,
    INDEX par_ind (parent_id),
    FOREIGN KEY (parent_id)
        REFERENCES parent(id)
) ENGINE=INNODB;
```

Insert a row into the parent table, like this:

```sql
mysql> INSERT INTO parent (id) VALUES ROW(1);
```

Verify that the data was inserted. You can do this simply by
selecting all rows from `parent`, as shown
here:

```sql
mysql> TABLE parent;
+----+
| id |
+----+
|  1 |
+----+
```

Insert a row into the child table using the following SQL
statement:

```sql
mysql> INSERT INTO child (id,parent_id) VALUES ROW(1,1);
```

The insert operation is successful because
`parent_id` 1 is present in the parent table.

Insertion of a row into the child table with a
`parent_id` value that is not present in the
parent table is rejected with an error, as you can see here:

```sql
mysql> INSERT INTO child (id,parent_id) VALUES ROW(2,2);
ERROR 1452 (23000): Cannot add or update a child row: a foreign key constraint fails
(`test`.`child`, CONSTRAINT `child_ibfk_1` FOREIGN KEY (`parent_id`)
REFERENCES `parent` (`id`))
```

The operation fails because the specified
`parent_id` value does not exist in the parent
table.

Trying to delete the previously inserted row from the parent
table also fails, as shown here:

```sql
mysql> DELETE FROM parent WHERE id = 1;
ERROR 1451 (23000): Cannot delete or update a parent row: a foreign key constraint fails
(`test`.`child`, CONSTRAINT `child_ibfk_1` FOREIGN KEY (`parent_id`)
REFERENCES `parent` (`id`))
```

This operation fails because the record in the child table
contains the referenced id (`parent_id`) value.

When an operation affects a key value in the parent table that
has matching rows in the child table, the result depends on the
referential action specified by `ON UPDATE` and
`ON DELETE` subclauses of the `FOREIGN
KEY` clause. Omitting `ON DELETE` and
`ON UPDATE` clauses (as in the current child
table definition) is the same as specifying the
`RESTRICT` option, which rejects operations
that affect a key value in the parent table that has matching
rows in the parent table.

To demonstrate `ON DELETE` and `ON
UPDATE` referential actions, drop the child table and
recreate it to include `ON UPDATE` and
`ON DELETE` subclauses with the
`CASCADE` option. The
`CASCADE` option automatically deletes or
updates matching rows in the child table when deleting or
updating rows in the parent table.

```sql
DROP TABLE child;

CREATE TABLE child (
    id INT,
    parent_id INT,
    INDEX par_ind (parent_id),
    FOREIGN KEY (parent_id)
        REFERENCES parent(id)
        ON UPDATE CASCADE
        ON DELETE CASCADE
) ENGINE=INNODB;
```

Insert some rows into the child table using the statement shown
here:

```sql
mysql> INSERT INTO child (id,parent_id) VALUES ROW(1,1), ROW(2,1), ROW(3,1);
```

Verify that the data was inserted, like this:

```sql
mysql> TABLE child;
+------+-----------+
| id   | parent_id |
+------+-----------+
|    1 |         1 |
|    2 |         1 |
|    3 |         1 |
+------+-----------+
```

Update the ID in the parent table, changing it from 1 to 2,
using the SQL statement shown here:

```sql
mysql> UPDATE parent SET id = 2 WHERE id = 1;
```

Verify that the update was successful by selecting all rows from
the parent table, as shown here:

```sql
mysql> TABLE parent;
+----+
| id |
+----+
|  2 |
+----+
```

Verify that the `ON UPDATE CASCADE` referential
action updated the child table, like this:

```sql
mysql> TABLE child;
+------+-----------+
| id   | parent_id |
+------+-----------+
|    1 |         2 |
|    2 |         2 |
|    3 |         2 |
+------+-----------+
```

To demonstrate the `ON DELETE CASCADE`
referential action, delete records from the parent table where
`parent_id = 2`; this deletes all records in
the parent table.

```sql
mysql> DELETE FROM parent WHERE id = 2;
```

Because all records in the child table are associated with
`parent_id = 2`, the `ON DELETE
CASCADE` referential action removes all records from
the child table, as shown here:

```sql
mysql> TABLE child;
Empty set (0.00 sec)
```
