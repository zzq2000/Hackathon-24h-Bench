### 15.1.7 ALTER PROCEDURE Statement

```sql
ALTER PROCEDURE proc_name [characteristic ...]

characteristic: {
    COMMENT 'string'
  | LANGUAGE SQL
  | { CONTAINS SQL | NO SQL | READS SQL DATA | MODIFIES SQL DATA }
  | SQL SECURITY { DEFINER | INVOKER }
}
```

This statement can be used to change the characteristics of a
stored procedure. More than one change may be specified in an
[`ALTER PROCEDURE`](alter-procedure.md "15.1.7 ALTER PROCEDURE Statement") statement. However,
you cannot change the parameters or body of a stored procedure
using this statement; to make such changes, you must drop and
re-create the procedure using [`DROP
PROCEDURE`](drop-procedure.md "15.1.29 DROP PROCEDURE and DROP FUNCTION Statements") and [`CREATE
PROCEDURE`](create-procedure.md "15.1.17 CREATE PROCEDURE and CREATE FUNCTION Statements").

You must have the [`ALTER ROUTINE`](privileges-provided.md#priv_alter-routine)
privilege for the procedure. By default, that privilege is granted
automatically to the procedure creator. This behavior can be
changed by disabling the
[`automatic_sp_privileges`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_automatic_sp_privileges) system
variable. See [Section 27.2.2, “Stored Routines and MySQL Privileges”](stored-routines-privileges.md "27.2.2 Stored Routines and MySQL Privileges").
