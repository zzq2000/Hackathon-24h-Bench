### 20.8.1 Combining Different Member Versions in a Group

[20.8.1.1 Member Versions During Upgrades](group-replication-compatibility-upgrade.md)

[20.8.1.2 Group Replication Communication Protocol Version](group-replication-compatibility-communication.md)

Group Replication is versioned according to the MySQL Server
version that the Group Replication plugin was bundled with. For
example, if a member is running MySQL 5.7.26 then that is the
version of the Group Replication plugin. To check the version of
MySQL Server on a group member issue:

```sql
SELECT MEMBER_HOST,MEMBER_PORT,MEMBER_VERSION FROM performance_schema.replication_group_members;
+-------------+-------------+----------------+
| member_host | member_port | member_version |
+-------------+-------------+----------------+
| example.com |	   3306     |   8.0.13	     |
+-------------+-------------+----------------+
```

For guidance on understanding the MySQL Server version and
selecting a version, see [Section 2.1.2, “Which MySQL Version and Distribution to Install”](which-version.md "2.1.2 Which MySQL Version and Distribution to Install").

For optimal compatibility and performance, all members of a group
should run the same version of MySQL Server and therefore of Group
Replication. However, while you are in the process of upgrading an
online group, in order to maximize availability, you might need to
have members with different MySQL Server versions running at the
same time. Depending on the changes made between the versions of
MySQL, you could encounter incompatibilities in this situation.
For example, if a feature has been deprecated between major
versions, then combining the versions in a group might cause
members that rely on the deprecated feature to fail. Conversely,
writing to a member running a newer MySQL version while there are
read-write members in the group running an older MySQL version
might cause issues on members that lack functions introduced in
the newer release.

To prevent these issues, Group Replication includes compatibility
policies that enable you to safely combine members running
different versions of MySQL in the same group. A member applies
these policies to decide whether to join the group normally, or
join in read-only mode, or not join the group, depending on which
choice results in the safe operation of the joining member and of
the existing members of the group. In an upgrade scenario, each
server must leave the group, be upgraded, and rejoin the group
with its new server version. At this point the member applies the
policies for its new server version, which might have changed from
the policies it applied when it originally joined the group.

As the administrator, you can instruct any server to attempt to
join any group by configuring the server appropriately and issuing
a [`START GROUP_REPLICATION`](start-group-replication.md "15.4.3.1 START GROUP_REPLICATION Statement")
statement. A decision to join or not join the group, or to join
the group in read-only mode, is made and implemented by the
joining member itself after you attempt to add it to the group.
The joining member receives information on the MySQL Server
versions of the current group members, assesses its own
compatibility with those members, and applies the policies used in
its own MySQL Server version (*not* the
policies used by the existing members) to decide whether it is
compatible.

The compatibility policies that a joining member applies when
attempting to join a group are as follows:

- A member does not join a group if it is running a lower MySQL
  Server version than the lowest version that the existing group
  members are running.
- A member joins a group normally if it is running the same
  MySQL Server version as the lowest version that the existing
  group members are running.
- A member joins a group but remains in read-only mode if it is
  running a higher MySQL Server version than the lowest version
  that the existing group members are running. This behavior
  only makes a difference when the group is running in
  multi-primary mode, because in a group that is running in
  single-primary mode, newly added members default to being
  read-only in any case.

Members running MySQL 8.0.17 or higher take into account the patch
version of the release when checking their compatibility. Members
running MySQL 8.0.16 or lower, or MySQL 5.7, only take into
account the major version. For example, if you have a group with
members all running MySQL version 8.0.13:

- A member that is running MySQL version 5.7 does not join.
- A member running MySQL 8.0.16 joins normally (because it
  considers the major version).
- A member running MySQL 8.0.17 joins but remains in read-only
  mode (because it considers the patch version).

Note that joining members running releases before MySQL 5.7.27
check against all group members to find whether their own MySQL
Server major version is lower. They therefore fail this check for
a group where any members are running MySQL 8.0 releases, and
cannot join the group even if it already has other members running
MySQL 5.7. From MySQL 5.7.27, joining members only check against
the group members that are running the lowest major version, so
they can join a mixed version group where other MySQL 5.7 servers
are present.

In a multi-primary mode group with members that use different
MySQL Server versions, Group Replication automatically manages the
read-write and read-only status of members running MySQL 8.0.17 or
higher. If a member leaves the group, the members running the
version that is now the lowest are automatically set to read-write
mode. When you change a group that was running in single-primary
mode to run in multi-primary mode, using the
[`group_replication_switch_to_multi_primary_mode()`](group-replication-functions-for-mode.md#function_group-replication-switch-to-multi-primary-mode)
function, Group Replication automatically sets members to the
correct mode. Members are automatically placed in read-only mode
if they are running a higher MySQL server version than the lowest
version present in the group, and members running the lowest
version are placed in read-write mode.
