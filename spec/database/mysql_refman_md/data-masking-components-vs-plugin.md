### 8.5.1 Data-Masking Components Versus the Data-Masking Plugin

Prior to 8.0.33, MySQL enabled masking and de-identification
capabilities using a server-side plugin, but transitioned to use
the component infrastructure in MySQL 8.0.33. The following table
briefly compares MySQL Enterprise Data Masking and De-Identification components and the plugin library to
provide an overview of their differences. It may assist you in
making the transition from the plugin to components.

Note

Only the data-masking components or the plugin should be enabled
at a time. Enabling both components and the plugin is
unsupported and results may not be as anticipated.
