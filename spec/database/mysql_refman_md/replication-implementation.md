Replication is based on the source server keeping track of all
changes to its databases (updates, deletes, and so on) in its binary
log. The binary log serves as a written record of all events that
modify database structure or content (data) from the moment the
server was started. Typically, [`SELECT`](select.md "15.2.13 SELECT Statement")
statements are not recorded because they modify neither database
structure nor content.

Each replica that connects to the source requests a copy of the
binary log. That is, it pulls the data from the source, rather than
the source pushing the data to the replica. The replica also
executes the events from the binary log that it receives. This has
the effect of repeating the original changes just as they were made
on the source. Tables are created or their structure modified, and
data is inserted, deleted, and updated according to the changes that
were originally made on the source.

Because each replica is independent, the replaying of the changes
from the source's binary log occurs independently on each replica
that is connected to the source. In addition, because each replica
receives a copy of the binary log only by requesting it from the
source, the replica is able to read and update the copy of the
database at its own pace and can start and stop the replication
process at will without affecting the ability to update to the
latest database status on either the source or replica side.

For more information on the specifics of the replication
implementation, see [Section 19.2.3, “Replication Threads”](replication-threads.md "19.2.3 Replication Threads").

Source servers and replicas report their status in respect of the
replication process regularly so that you can monitor them. See
[Section 10.14, “Examining Server Thread (Process) Information”](thread-information.md "10.14 Examining Server Thread (Process) Information"), for descriptions of all
replicated-related states.

The source's binary log is written to a local relay log on the
replica before it is processed. The replica also records information
about the current position with the source's binary log and the
local relay log. See [Section 19.2.4, “Relay Log and Replication Metadata Repositories”](replica-logs.md "19.2.4 Relay Log and Replication Metadata Repositories").

Database changes are filtered on the replica according to a set of
rules that are applied according to the various configuration
options and variables that control event evaluation. For details on
how these rules are applied, see
[Section 19.2.5, “How Servers Evaluate Replication Filtering Rules”](replication-rules.md "19.2.5 How Servers Evaluate Replication Filtering Rules").
