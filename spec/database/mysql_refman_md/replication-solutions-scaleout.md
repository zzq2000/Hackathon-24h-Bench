### 19.4.5 Using Replication for Scale-Out

You can use replication as a scale-out solution; that is, where
you want to split up the load of database queries across multiple
database servers, within some reasonable limitations.

Because replication works from the distribution of one source to
one or more replicas, using replication for scale-out works best
in an environment where you have a high number of reads and low
number of writes/updates. Most websites fit into this category,
where users are browsing the website, reading articles, posts, or
viewing products. Updates only occur during session management, or
when making a purchase or adding a comment/message to a forum.

Replication in this situation enables you to distribute the reads
over the replicas, while still enabling your web servers to
communicate with the source when a write is required. You can see
a sample replication layout for this scenario in
[Figure 19.1, “Using Replication to Improve Performance During Scale-Out”](replication-solutions-scaleout.md#figure_replication-scaleout "Figure 19.1 Using Replication to Improve Performance During Scale-Out").

**Figure 19.1 Using Replication to Improve Performance During Scale-Out**

![Incoming requests from clients are directed to a load balancer, which distributes client data among a number of web clients. Writes made by web clients are directed to a single MySQL source server, and reads made by web clients are directed to one of three MySQL replica servers. Replication takes place from the MySQL source server to the three MySQL replica servers.](images/scaleout.png)

If the part of your code that is responsible for database access
has been properly abstracted/modularized, converting it to run
with a replicated setup should be very smooth and easy. Change the
implementation of your database access to send all writes to the
source, and to send reads to either the source or a replica. If
your code does not have this level of abstraction, setting up a
replicated system gives you the opportunity and motivation to
clean it up. Start by creating a wrapper library or module that
implements the following functions:

- `safe_writer_connect()`
- `safe_reader_connect()`
- `safe_reader_statement()`
- `safe_writer_statement()`

`safe_` in each function name means that the
function takes care of handling all error conditions. You can use
different names for the functions. The important thing is to have
a unified interface for connecting for reads, connecting for
writes, doing a read, and doing a write.

Then convert your client code to use the wrapper library. This may
be a painful and scary process at first, but it pays off in the
long run. All applications that use the approach just described
are able to take advantage of a source/replica configuration, even
one involving multiple replicas. The code is much easier to
maintain, and adding troubleshooting options is trivial. You need
modify only one or two functions (for example, to log how long
each statement took, or which statement among those issued gave
you an error).

If you have written a lot of code, you may want to automate the
conversion task by writing a conversion script. Ideally, your code
uses consistent programming style conventions. If not, then you
are probably better off rewriting it anyway, or at least going
through and manually regularizing it to use a consistent style.
