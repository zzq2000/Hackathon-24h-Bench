### 15.2.16 TABLE Statement

`TABLE` is a DML statement introduced in MySQL
8.0.19 which returns rows and columns of the named table.

```sql
TABLE table_name
    [ORDER BY column_name]
    [LIMIT number [OFFSET number]]
    [INTO OUTFILE 'file_name'
        [{FIELDS | COLUMNS}
            [TERMINATED BY 'string']
            [[OPTIONALLY] ENCLOSED BY 'char']
            [ESCAPED BY 'char']
        ]
        [LINES
            [STARTING BY 'string']
            [TERMINATED BY 'string']
        ]
    | INTO DUMPFILE 'file_name'
    | INTO var_name [, var_name] ...]
```

The `TABLE` statement in some ways acts like
[`SELECT`](select.md "15.2.13 SELECT Statement"). Given the existence of a
table named `t`, the following two statements
produce identical output:

```sql
TABLE t;

SELECT * FROM t;
```

You can order and limit the number of rows produced by
`TABLE` using `ORDER BY` and
`LIMIT` clauses, respectively. These function
identically to the same clauses when used with
`SELECT` (including an optional
`OFFSET` clause with `LIMIT`),
as you can see here:

```sql
mysql> TABLE t;
+----+----+
| a  | b  |
+----+----+
|  1 |  2 |
|  6 |  7 |
|  9 |  5 |
| 10 | -4 |
| 11 | -1 |
| 13 |  3 |
| 14 |  6 |
+----+----+
7 rows in set (0.00 sec)

mysql> TABLE t ORDER BY b;
+----+----+
| a  | b  |
+----+----+
| 10 | -4 |
| 11 | -1 |
|  1 |  2 |
| 13 |  3 |
|  9 |  5 |
| 14 |  6 |
|  6 |  7 |
+----+----+
7 rows in set (0.00 sec)

mysql> TABLE t LIMIT 3;
+---+---+
| a | b |
+---+---+
| 1 | 2 |
| 6 | 7 |
| 9 | 5 |
+---+---+
3 rows in set (0.00 sec)

mysql> TABLE t ORDER BY b LIMIT 3;
+----+----+
| a  | b  |
+----+----+
| 10 | -4 |
| 11 | -1 |
|  1 |  2 |
+----+----+
3 rows in set (0.00 sec)

mysql> TABLE t ORDER BY b LIMIT 3 OFFSET 2;
+----+----+
| a  | b  |
+----+----+
|  1 |  2 |
| 13 |  3 |
|  9 |  5 |
+----+----+
3 rows in set (0.00 sec)
```

`TABLE` differs from `SELECT` in
two key respects:

- `TABLE` always displays all columns of the
  table.

  *Exception*: The output of
  `TABLE` does *not* include
  invisible columns. See [Section 15.1.20.10, “Invisible Columns”](invisible-columns.md "15.1.20.10 Invisible Columns").
- `TABLE` does not allow for any arbitrary
  filtering of rows; that is, `TABLE` does not
  support any `WHERE` clause.

For limiting which table columns are returned, filtering rows
beyond what can be accomplished using `ORDER BY`
and `LIMIT`, or both, use
`SELECT`.

`TABLE` can be used with temporary tables.

`TABLE` can also be used in place of
`SELECT` in a number of other constructs,
including those listed here:

- With set operators such as
  [`UNION`](union.md "15.2.18 UNION Clause"), as shown here:

  ```sql
  mysql> TABLE t1;
  +---+----+
  | a | b  |
  +---+----+
  | 2 | 10 |
  | 5 |  3 |
  | 7 |  8 |
  +---+----+
  3 rows in set (0.00 sec)

  mysql> TABLE t2;
  +---+---+
  | a | b |
  +---+---+
  | 1 | 2 |
  | 3 | 4 |
  | 6 | 7 |
  +---+---+
  3 rows in set (0.00 sec)

  mysql> TABLE t1 UNION TABLE t2;
  +---+----+
  | a | b  |
  +---+----+
  | 2 | 10 |
  | 5 |  3 |
  | 7 |  8 |
  | 1 |  2 |
  | 3 |  4 |
  | 6 |  7 |
  +---+----+
  6 rows in set (0.00 sec)
  ```

  The [`UNION`](union.md "15.2.18 UNION Clause") just shown is
  equivalent to the following statement:

  ```sql
  mysql> SELECT * FROM t1 UNION SELECT * FROM t2;
  +---+----+
  | a | b  |
  +---+----+
  | 2 | 10 |
  | 5 |  3 |
  | 7 |  8 |
  | 1 |  2 |
  | 3 |  4 |
  | 6 |  7 |
  +---+----+
  6 rows in set (0.00 sec)
  ```

  `TABLE` can also be used together in set
  operations with `SELECT` statements,
  [`VALUES`](values.md "15.2.19 VALUES Statement") statements, or both. See
  [Section 15.2.18, “UNION Clause”](union.md "15.2.18 UNION Clause"), [Section 15.2.4, “EXCEPT Clause”](except.md "15.2.4 EXCEPT Clause"), and
  [Section 15.2.8, “INTERSECT Clause”](intersect.md "15.2.8 INTERSECT Clause"), for more information and
  examples. See also [Section 15.2.14, “Set Operations with UNION, INTERSECT, and EXCEPT”](set-operations.md "15.2.14 Set Operations with UNION, INTERSECT, and EXCEPT").
- With `INTO` to populate user variables, and
  with `INTO OUTFILE` or `INTO
  DUMPFILE` to write table data to a file. See
  [Section 15.2.13.1, “SELECT ... INTO Statement”](select-into.md "15.2.13.1 SELECT ... INTO Statement"), for more specific information
  and examples.
- In many cases where you can employ subqueries. Given any table
  `t1` with a column named
  `a`, and a second table `t2`
  having a single column, statements such as the following are
  possible:

  ```sql
  SELECT * FROM t1 WHERE a IN (TABLE t2);
  ```

  Assuming that the single column of table `t1`
  is named `x`, the preceding is equivalent to
  each of the statements shown here (and produces exactly the
  same result in either case):

  ```sql
  SELECT * FROM t1 WHERE a IN (SELECT x FROM t2);

  SELECT * FROM t1 WHERE a IN (SELECT * FROM t2);
  ```

  See [Section 15.2.15, “Subqueries”](subqueries.md "15.2.15 Subqueries"), for more information.
- With [`INSERT`](insert.md "15.2.7 INSERT Statement") and
  [`REPLACE`](replace.md "15.2.12 REPLACE Statement") statements, where you
  would otherwise use
  [`SELECT *`](select.md "15.2.13 SELECT Statement").
  See [Section 15.2.7.1, “INSERT ... SELECT Statement”](insert-select.md "15.2.7.1 INSERT ... SELECT Statement"), for more information and
  examples.
- [`TABLE`](table.md "15.2.16 TABLE Statement") can also be used in many
  cases in place of the [`SELECT`](select.md "15.2.13 SELECT Statement") in
  [`CREATE
  TABLE ... SELECT`](create-table-select.md "15.1.20.4 CREATE TABLE ... SELECT Statement") or
  [`CREATE VIEW ...
  SELECT`](create-view.md "15.1.23 CREATE VIEW Statement"). See the descriptions of these statements for
  more information and examples.
