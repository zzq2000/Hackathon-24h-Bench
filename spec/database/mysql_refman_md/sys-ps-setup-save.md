#### 30.4.4.14 The ps\_setup\_save() Procedure

Saves the current Performance Schema configuration. This
enables you to alter the configuration temporarily for
debugging or other purposes, then restore it to the previous
state by invoking the
[`ps_setup_reload_saved()`](sys-ps-setup-reload-saved.md "30.4.4.12 The ps_setup_reload_saved() Procedure")
procedure.

To prevent other simultaneous calls to save the configuration,
[`ps_setup_save()`](sys-ps-setup-save.md "30.4.4.14 The ps_setup_save() Procedure") acquires an
advisory lock named `sys.ps_setup_save` by
calling the [`GET_LOCK()`](locking-functions.md#function_get-lock)
function. [`ps_setup_save()`](sys-ps-setup-save.md "30.4.4.14 The ps_setup_save() Procedure") takes
a timeout parameter to indicate how many seconds to wait if
the lock already exists (which indicates that some other
session has a saved configuration outstanding). If the timeout
expires without obtaining the lock,
[`ps_setup_save()`](sys-ps-setup-save.md "30.4.4.14 The ps_setup_save() Procedure") fails.

It is intended you call
[`ps_setup_reload_saved()`](sys-ps-setup-reload-saved.md "30.4.4.12 The ps_setup_reload_saved() Procedure") later
within the *same* session as
[`ps_setup_save()`](sys-ps-setup-save.md "30.4.4.14 The ps_setup_save() Procedure") because the
configuration is saved in `TEMPORARY` tables.
[`ps_setup_save()`](sys-ps-setup-save.md "30.4.4.14 The ps_setup_save() Procedure") drops the
temporary tables and releases the lock. If you end your
session without invoking
[`ps_setup_save()`](sys-ps-setup-save.md "30.4.4.14 The ps_setup_save() Procedure"), the tables and
lock disappear automatically.

This procedure disables binary logging during its execution by
manipulating the session value of the
[`sql_log_bin`](replication-options-binary-log.md#sysvar_sql_log_bin) system variable.
That is a restricted operation, so the procedure requires
privileges sufficient to set restricted session variables. See
[Section 7.1.9.1, “System Variable Privileges”](system-variable-privileges.md "7.1.9.1 System Variable Privileges").

##### Parameters

- `in_timeout INT`: How many seconds to
  wait to obtain the `sys.ps_setup_save`
  lock. A negative timeout value means infinite timeout.

##### Example

```sql
mysql> CALL sys.ps_setup_save(10);

... make Performance Schema configuration changes ...

mysql> CALL sys.ps_setup_reload_saved();
```
