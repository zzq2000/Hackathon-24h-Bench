[12.13.3 Multi-Byte Character Support for Complex Character Sets](multibyte-characters.md)

This section discusses the procedure for adding a character set to
MySQL. The proper procedure depends on whether the character set
is simple or complex:

- If the character set does not need special string collating
  routines for sorting and does not need multibyte character
  support, it is simple.
- If the character set needs either of those features, it is
  complex.

For example, `greek` and `swe7`
are simple character sets, whereas `big5` and
`czech` are complex character sets.

To use the following instructions, you must have a MySQL source
distribution. In the instructions,
*`MYSET`* represents the name of the
character set that you want to add.

1. Add a `<charset>` element for
   *`MYSET`* to the
   `sql/share/charsets/Index.xml` file. Use
   the existing contents in the file as a guide to adding new
   contents. A partial listing for the `latin1`
   `<charset>` element follows:

   ```xml
   <charset name="latin1">
     <family>Western</family>
     <description>cp1252 West European</description>
     ...
     <collation name="latin1_swedish_ci" id="8" order="Finnish, Swedish">
       <flag>primary</flag>
       <flag>compiled</flag>
     </collation>
     <collation name="latin1_danish_ci" id="15" order="Danish"/>
     ...
     <collation name="latin1_bin" id="47" order="Binary">
       <flag>binary</flag>
       <flag>compiled</flag>
     </collation>
     ...
   </charset>
   ```

   The `<charset>` element must list all
   the collations for the character set. These must include at
   least a binary collation and a default (primary) collation.
   The default collation is often named using a suffix of
   `general_ci` (general, case-insensitive). It
   is possible for the binary collation to be the default
   collation, but usually they are different. The default
   collation should have a `primary` flag. The
   binary collation should have a `binary` flag.

   You must assign a unique ID number to each collation. The
   range of IDs from 1024 to 2047 is reserved for user-defined
   collations. To find the maximum of the currently used
   collation IDs, use this query:

   ```sql
   SELECT MAX(ID) FROM INFORMATION_SCHEMA.COLLATIONS;
   ```
2. This step depends on whether you are adding a simple or
   complex character set. A simple character set requires only a
   configuration file, whereas a complex character set requires C
   source file that defines collation functions, multibyte
   functions, or both.

   For a simple character set, create a configuration file,
   `MYSET.xml`,
   that describes the character set properties. Create this file
   in the `sql/share/charsets` directory. You
   can use a copy of `latin1.xml` as the basis
   for this file. The syntax for the file is very simple:

   - Comments are written as ordinary XML comments
     (`<!-- text
     -->`).
   - Words within `<map>` array elements
     are separated by arbitrary amounts of whitespace.
   - Each word within `<map>` array
     elements must be a number in hexadecimal format.
   - The `<map>` array element for the
     `<ctype>` element has 257 words.
     The other `<map>` array elements
     after that have 256 words. See
     [Section 12.13.1, “Character Definition Arrays”](character-arrays.md "12.13.1 Character Definition Arrays").
   - For each collation listed in the
     `<charset>` element for the
     character set in `Index.xml`,
     `MYSET.xml`
     must contain a `<collation>`
     element that defines the character ordering.

   For a complex character set, create a C source file that
   describes the character set properties and defines the support
   routines necessary to properly perform operations on the
   character set:

   - Create the file
     `ctype-MYSET.c`
     in the `strings` directory. Look at one
     of the existing `ctype-*.c` files (such
     as `ctype-big5.c`) to see what needs to
     be defined. The arrays in your file must have names like
     `ctype_MYSET`,
     `to_lower_MYSET`,
     and so on. These correspond to the arrays for a simple
     character set. See [Section 12.13.1, “Character Definition Arrays”](character-arrays.md "12.13.1 Character Definition Arrays").
   - For each `<collation>` element
     listed in the `<charset>` element
     for the character set in `Index.xml`,
     the
     `ctype-MYSET.c`
     file must provide an implementation of the collation.
   - If the character set requires string collating functions,
     see [Section 12.13.2, “String Collating Support for Complex Character Sets”](string-collating.md "12.13.2 String Collating Support for Complex Character Sets").
   - If the character set requires multibyte character support,
     see [Section 12.13.3, “Multi-Byte Character Support for Complex Character Sets”](multibyte-characters.md "12.13.3 Multi-Byte Character Support for Complex Character Sets").
3. Modify the configuration information. Use the existing
   configuration information as a guide to adding information for
   *`MYSYS`*. The example here assumes
   that the character set has default and binary collations, but
   more lines are needed if *`MYSET`* has
   additional collations.

   1. Edit `mysys/charset-def.c`, and
      “register” the collations for the new
      character set.

      Add these lines to the “declaration” section:

      ```c
      #ifdef HAVE_CHARSET_MYSET
      extern CHARSET_INFO my_charset_MYSET_general_ci;
      extern CHARSET_INFO my_charset_MYSET_bin;
      #endif
      ```

      Add these lines to the “registration”
      section:

      ```c
      #ifdef HAVE_CHARSET_MYSET
        add_compiled_collation(&my_charset_MYSET_general_ci);
        add_compiled_collation(&my_charset_MYSET_bin);
      #endif
      ```
   2. If the character set uses
      `ctype-MYSET.c`,
      edit `strings/CMakeLists.txt` and add
      `ctype-MYSET.c`
      to the definition of the
      `STRINGS_SOURCES` variable.
   3. Edit `cmake/character_sets.cmake`:

      1. Add *`MYSET`* to the value of
         with `CHARSETS_AVAILABLE` in
         alphabetic order.
      2. Add *`MYSET`* to the value of
         `CHARSETS_COMPLEX` in alphabetic
         order. This is needed even for simple character sets,
         so that **CMake** can recognize
         [`-DDEFAULT_CHARSET=MYSET`](source-configuration-options.md#option_cmake_default_charset).
4. Reconfigure, recompile, and test.
