#### 15.2.15.9 Lateral Derived Tables

A derived table cannot normally refer to (depend on) columns of
preceding tables in the same `FROM` clause. As
of MySQL 8.0.14, a derived table may be defined as a lateral
derived table to specify that such references are permitted.

Nonlateral derived tables are specified using the syntax
discussed in [Section 15.2.15.8, “Derived Tables”](derived-tables.md "15.2.15.8 Derived Tables"). The syntax for a
lateral derived table is the same as for a nonlateral derived
table except that the keyword `LATERAL` is
specified before the derived table specification. The
`LATERAL` keyword must precede each table to be
used as a lateral derived table.

Lateral derived tables are subject to these restrictions:

- A lateral derived table can occur only in a
  `FROM` clause, either in a list of tables
  separated with commas or in a join specification
  (`JOIN`, `INNER JOIN`,
  `CROSS JOIN`, `LEFT [OUTER]
  JOIN`, or `RIGHT [OUTER] JOIN`).
- If a lateral derived table is in the right operand of a join
  clause and contains a reference to the left operand, the
  join operation must be an `INNER JOIN`,
  `CROSS JOIN`, or `LEFT [OUTER]
  JOIN`.

  If the table is in the left operand and contains a reference
  to the right operand, the join operation must be an
  `INNER JOIN`, `CROSS
  JOIN`, or `RIGHT [OUTER] JOIN`.
- If a lateral derived table references an aggregate function,
  the function's aggregation query cannot be the one that owns
  the `FROM` clause in which the lateral
  derived table occurs.
- In accordance with the SQL standard, MySQL always treats a
  join with a table function such as
  [`JSON_TABLE()`](json-table-functions.md#function_json-table) as though
  `LATERAL` had been used. This is true
  regardless of MySQL release version, which is why it is
  possible to join against this function even in MySQL
  versions prior to 8.0.14. In MySQL 8.0.14 and later, the
  `LATERAL` keyword is implicit, and is not
  allowed before `JSON_TABLE()`. This is also
  according to the SQL standard.

The following discussion shows how lateral derived tables make
possible certain SQL operations that cannot be done with
nonlateral derived tables or that require less-efficient
workarounds.

Suppose that we want to solve this problem: Given a table of
people in a sales force (where each row describes a member of
the sales force), and a table of all sales (where each row
describes a sale: salesperson, customer, amount, date),
determine the size and customer of the largest sale for each
salesperson. This problem can be approached two ways.

First approach to solving the problem: For each salesperson,
calculate the maximum sale size, and also find the customer who
provided this maximum. In MySQL, that can be done like this:

```sql
SELECT
  salesperson.name,
  -- find maximum sale size for this salesperson
  (SELECT MAX(amount) AS amount
    FROM all_sales
    WHERE all_sales.salesperson_id = salesperson.id)
  AS amount,
  -- find customer for this maximum size
  (SELECT customer_name
    FROM all_sales
    WHERE all_sales.salesperson_id = salesperson.id
    AND all_sales.amount =
         -- find maximum size, again
         (SELECT MAX(amount) AS amount
           FROM all_sales
           WHERE all_sales.salesperson_id = salesperson.id))
  AS customer_name
FROM
  salesperson;
```

That query is inefficient because it calculates the maximum size
twice per salesperson (once in the first subquery and once in
the second).

We can try to achieve an efficiency gain by calculating the
maximum once per salesperson and “caching” it in a
derived table, as shown by this modified query:

```sql
SELECT
  salesperson.name,
  max_sale.amount,
  max_sale_customer.customer_name
FROM
  salesperson,
  -- calculate maximum size, cache it in transient derived table max_sale
  (SELECT MAX(amount) AS amount
    FROM all_sales
    WHERE all_sales.salesperson_id = salesperson.id)
  AS max_sale,
  -- find customer, reusing cached maximum size
  (SELECT customer_name
    FROM all_sales
    WHERE all_sales.salesperson_id = salesperson.id
    AND all_sales.amount =
        -- the cached maximum size
        max_sale.amount)
  AS max_sale_customer;
```

However, the query is illegal in SQL-92 because derived tables
cannot depend on other tables in the same
`FROM` clause. Derived tables must be constant
over the query's duration, not contain references to columns of
other `FROM` clause tables. As written, the
query produces this error:

```none
ERROR 1054 (42S22): Unknown column 'salesperson.id' in 'where clause'
```

In SQL:1999, the query becomes legal if the derived tables are
preceded by the `LATERAL` keyword (which means
“this derived table depends on previous tables on its left
side”):

```sql
SELECT
  salesperson.name,
  max_sale.amount,
  max_sale_customer.customer_name
FROM
  salesperson,
  -- calculate maximum size, cache it in transient derived table max_sale
  LATERAL
  (SELECT MAX(amount) AS amount
    FROM all_sales
    WHERE all_sales.salesperson_id = salesperson.id)
  AS max_sale,
  -- find customer, reusing cached maximum size
  LATERAL
  (SELECT customer_name
    FROM all_sales
    WHERE all_sales.salesperson_id = salesperson.id
    AND all_sales.amount =
        -- the cached maximum size
        max_sale.amount)
  AS max_sale_customer;
```

A lateral derived table need not be constant and is brought up
to date each time a new row from a preceding table on which it
depends is processed by the top query.

Second approach to solving the problem: A different solution
could be used if a subquery in the
[`SELECT`](select.md "15.2.13 SELECT Statement") list could return multiple
columns:

```sql
SELECT
  salesperson.name,
  -- find maximum size and customer at same time
  (SELECT amount, customer_name
    FROM all_sales
    WHERE all_sales.salesperson_id = salesperson.id
    ORDER BY amount DESC LIMIT 1)
FROM
  salesperson;
```

That is efficient but illegal. It does not work because such
subqueries can return only a single column:

```none
ERROR 1241 (21000): Operand should contain 1 column(s)
```

One attempt at rewriting the query is to select multiple columns
from a derived table:

```sql
SELECT
  salesperson.name,
  max_sale.amount,
  max_sale.customer_name
FROM
  salesperson,
  -- find maximum size and customer at same time
  (SELECT amount, customer_name
    FROM all_sales
    WHERE all_sales.salesperson_id = salesperson.id
    ORDER BY amount DESC LIMIT 1)
  AS max_sale;
```

However, that also does not work. The derived table is dependent
on the `salesperson` table and thus fails
without `LATERAL`:

```none
ERROR 1054 (42S22): Unknown column 'salesperson.id' in 'where clause'
```

Adding the `LATERAL` keyword makes the query
legal:

```sql
SELECT
  salesperson.name,
  max_sale.amount,
  max_sale.customer_name
FROM
  salesperson,
  -- find maximum size and customer at same time
  LATERAL
  (SELECT amount, customer_name
    FROM all_sales
    WHERE all_sales.salesperson_id = salesperson.id
    ORDER BY amount DESC LIMIT 1)
  AS max_sale;
```

In short, `LATERAL` is the efficient solution
to all drawbacks in the two approaches just discussed.
