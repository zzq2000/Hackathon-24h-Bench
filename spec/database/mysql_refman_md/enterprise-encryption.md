Note

MySQL Enterprise Encryption is an extension included in MySQL Enterprise Edition, a commercial
product. To learn more about commercial products,
<https://www.mysql.com/products/>.

MySQL Enterprise Edition includes a set of encryption functions that expose OpenSSL
capabilities at the SQL level. The functions enable Enterprise
applications to perform the following operations:

- Implement added data protection using public-key asymmetric
  cryptography
- Create public and private keys and digital signatures
- Perform asymmetric encryption and decryption
- Use cryptographic hashing for digital signing and data
  verification and validation

In releases before MySQL 8.0.30, these functions are based on the
`openssl_udf` shared library. From MySQL 8.0.30,
they are provided by a MySQL component
`component_enterprise_encryption`.
