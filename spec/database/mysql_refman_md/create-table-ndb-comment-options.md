#### 15.1.20.12 Setting NDB Comment Options

- [NDB\_COLUMN Options](create-table-ndb-comment-options.md#create-table-ndb-comment-column-options "NDB_COLUMN Options")
- [NDB\_TABLE Options](create-table-ndb-comment-options.md#create-table-ndb-comment-table-options "NDB_TABLE Options")

It is possible to set a number of options specific to NDB
Cluster in the table comment or column comments of an
[`NDB`](mysql-cluster.md "Chapter 25 MySQL NDB Cluster 8.0") table. Table-level options for
controlling read from any replica and partition balance can be
embedded in a table comment using `NDB_TABLE`.

`NDB_COLUMN` can be used in a column comment to
set the size of the blob parts table column used for storing
parts of blob values by `NDB` to its maximum.
This works for [`BLOB`](blob.md "13.3.4 The BLOB and TEXT Types"),
`MEDIUMBLOB`, `LONGBLOB`,
[`TEXT`](blob.md "13.3.4 The BLOB and TEXT Types"),
`MEDIUMTEXT`, `LONGTEXT`, and
[`JSON`](json.md "13.5 The JSON Data Type") columns. Beginning with NDB
8.0.30, a column comment can also be used to control the inline
size of a blob column. `NDB_COLUMN` comments do
not support `TINYBLOB` or
`TINYTEXT` columns, since these have an inline
part (only) of fixed size, and no separate parts to store
elsewhere.

`NDB_TABLE` can be used in a table comment to
set options relating to partition balance and whether the table
is fully replicated, among others.

The remainder of this section describes these options and their
use.

##### NDB\_COLUMN Options

In NDB Cluster, a column comment in a `CREATE
TABLE` or [`ALTER TABLE`](alter-table.md "15.1.9 ALTER TABLE Statement")
statement can also be used to specify an
`NDB_COLUMN` option. Beginning with version
8.0.30, `NDB` supports two column comment
options `BLOB_INLINE_SIZE` and
`MAX_BLOB_PART_SIZE`. (Prior to NDB 8.0.30,
only `MAX_BLOB_PART_SIZE` is supported.) Syntax
for this option is shown here:

```sql
COMMENT 'NDB_COLUMN=speclist'

speclist := spec[,spec]

spec :=
    BLOB_INLINE_SIZE=value
  | MAX_BLOB_PART_SIZE[={0|1}]
```

`BLOB_INLINE_SIZE` specifies the number of
bytes to be stored inline by the column; its expected value is
an integer in the range 1 - 29980, inclusive. Setting a value
greater than 29980 raises an error; setting a value less than 1
is allowed, but causes the default inline size for the column
type to be used.

You should be aware that the maximum value for this option is
actually the maximum number of bytes that can be stored in one
row of an `NDB` table; every column in the row
contributes to this total.

You should also keep in mind, especially when working with
`TEXT` columns, that the value set by
`MAX_BLOB_PART_SIZE` or
`BLOB_INLINE_SIZE` represents column size in
bytes. It does not indicate the number of characters, which
varies according to the character set and collation used by the
column.

To see the effects of this option, first create a table with two
`BLOB` columns, one (`b1`)
with no extra options, and another (`b2`) with
a setting for `BLOB_INLINE_SIZE`, as shown
here:

```sql
mysql> CREATE TABLE t1 (
    ->    a INT NOT NULL PRIMARY KEY,
    ->    b1 BLOB,
    ->    b2 BLOB COMMENT 'NDB_COLUMN=BLOB_INLINE_SIZE=8000'
    ->  ) ENGINE NDB;
Query OK, 0 rows affected (0.32 sec)
```

You can see the `BLOB_INLINE_SIZE` settings for
the `BLOB` columns by querying the
[`ndbinfo.blobs`](mysql-cluster-ndbinfo-blobs.md "25.6.16.4 The ndbinfo blobs Table") table, like
this:

```sql
mysql> SELECT
    ->   column_name AS 'Column Name',
    ->   inline_size AS 'Inline Size',
    ->   part_size AS 'Blob Part Size'
    -> FROM ndbinfo.blobs
    -> WHERE table_name = 't1';
+-------------+-------------+----------------+
| Column Name | Inline Size | Blob Part Size |
+-------------+-------------+----------------+
| b1          |         256 |           2000 |
| b2          |        8000 |           2000 |
+-------------+-------------+----------------+
2 rows in set (0.01 sec)
```

You can also check the output from the
[**ndb\_desc**](mysql-cluster-programs-ndb-desc.md "25.5.9 ndb_desc — Describe NDB Tables") utility, as shown here, with the
relevant lines displayed using emphasized text:

-- Indexes --
PRIMARY KEY(a) - UniqueHashIndex
PRIMARY(a) - OrderedIndex
```

`BLOB_INLINE_SIZE` has no effect on
[`TINYBLOB`](blob.md "13.3.4 The BLOB and TEXT Types") columns. In NDB 8.0.41
and later, it is disallowed with `TINYBLOB`,
and causes a warning if used.

For `MAX_BLOB_PART_SIZE`, the
`=` sign and the value following it are
optional. Using any value other than 0 or 1 results in a syntax
error.

The effect of using `MAX_BLOB_PART_SIZE` in a
column comment is to set the blob part size of a
[`TEXT`](blob.md "13.3.4 The BLOB and TEXT Types") or
[`BLOB`](blob.md "13.3.4 The BLOB and TEXT Types") column to the maximum number
of bytes supported for this by `NDB` (13948).
This option can be applied to any blob column type supported by
MySQL except `TINYBLOB` or
`TINYTEXT` (`BLOB`,
`MEDIUMBLOB`, `LONGBLOB`,
`TEXT`, `MEDIUMTEXT`,
`LONGTEXT`). Unlike
`BLOB_INLINE_SIZE`,
`MAX_BLOB_PART_SIZE` has no effect on
`JSON` columns.

To see the effects of this option, we first run the following
SQL statement in the [**mysql**](mysql.md "6.5.1 mysql — The MySQL Command-Line Client") client to create a
table with two `BLOB` columns, one
(`c1`) with no extra options, and another
(`c2`) with
`MAX_BLOB_PART_SIZE`:

```sql
mysql> CREATE TABLE test.t2 (
    ->   p INT PRIMARY KEY,
    ->   c1 BLOB,
    ->   c2 BLOB COMMENT 'NDB_COLUMN=MAX_BLOB_PART_SIZE'
    -> ) ENGINE NDB;
Query OK, 0 rows affected (0.32 sec)
```

From the system shell, run the [**ndb\_desc**](mysql-cluster-programs-ndb-desc.md "25.5.9 ndb_desc — Describe NDB Tables")
utility to obtain information about the table just created, as
shown in this example:

```terminal
$> ndb_desc -d test t2
-- t --
Version: 1
Fragment type: HashMapPartition
K Value: 6
Min load factor: 78
Max load factor: 80
Temporary table: no
Number of attributes: 3
Number of primary keys: 1
Length of frm data: 324
Row Checksum: 1
Row GCI: 1
SingleUserMode: 0
ForceVarPart: 1
FragmentCount: 2
ExtraRowGciBits: 0
ExtraRowAuthorBits: 0

c1 Blob(256,2000,0) NULL AT=MEDIUM_VAR ST=MEMORY BV=2 BT=NDB$BLOB_22_1
c2 Blob(256,13948,0) NULL AT=MEDIUM_VAR ST=MEMORY BV=2 BT=NDB$BLOB_22_2
-- Indexes --
PRIMARY KEY(p) - UniqueHashIndex
PRIMARY(p) - OrderedIndex
```

Column information in the output is listed under
`Attributes`; for columns `c1`
and `c2` it is displayed here in emphasized
text. For `c1`, the blob part size is 2000, the
default value; for `c2`, it is 13948, as set by
`MAX_BLOB_PART_SIZE`.

You can also query the `ndbinfo.blobs` table to
see this, as shown here:

```sql
mysql> SELECT
    ->   column_name AS 'Column Name',
    ->   inline_size AS 'Inline Size',
    ->   part_size AS 'Blob Part Size'
    -> FROM ndbinfo.blobs
    -> WHERE table_name = 't2';
+-------------+-------------+----------------+
| Column Name | Inline Size | Blob Part Size |
+-------------+-------------+----------------+
| c1          |         256 |           2000 |
| c2          |         256 |          13948 |
+-------------+-------------+----------------+
2 rows in set (0.00 sec)
```

You can change the blob part size for a given blob column of an
`NDB` table using an `ALTER
TABLE` statement such as this one, and verifying the
changes afterwards using [`SHOW CREATE
TABLE`](show-create-table.md "15.7.7.10 SHOW CREATE TABLE Statement"):

```sql
mysql> ALTER TABLE test.t2
    ->    DROP COLUMN c1,
    ->     ADD COLUMN c1 BLOB COMMENT 'NDB_COLUMN=MAX_BLOB_PART_SIZE',
    ->     CHANGE COLUMN c2 c2 BLOB AFTER c1;
Query OK, 0 rows affected (0.47 sec)
Records: 0  Duplicates: 0  Warnings: 0

mysql> SHOW CREATE TABLE test.t2\G
*************************** 1. row ***************************
       Table: t
Create Table: CREATE TABLE `t2` (
  `p` int(11) NOT NULL,
  `c1` blob COMMENT 'NDB_COLUMN=MAX_BLOB_PART_SIZE',
  `c2` blob,
  PRIMARY KEY (`p`)
) ENGINE=ndbcluster DEFAULT CHARSET=utf8mb4 COLLATE=utf8mb4_0900_ai_ci
1 row in set (0.00 sec)

mysql> EXIT
Bye
```

The output of [**ndb\_desc**](mysql-cluster-programs-ndb-desc.md "25.5.9 ndb_desc — Describe NDB Tables") shows that the blob
part sizes of the columns have been changed as expected:

```terminal
$> ndb_desc -d test t2
-- t --
Version: 16777220
Fragment type: HashMapPartition
K Value: 6
Min load factor: 78
Max load factor: 80
Temporary table: no
Number of attributes: 3
Number of primary keys: 1
Length of frm data: 324
Row Checksum: 1
Row GCI: 1
SingleUserMode: 0
ForceVarPart: 1
FragmentCount: 2
ExtraRowGciBits: 0
ExtraRowAuthorBits: 0
TableStatus: Retrieved
HashMap: DEFAULT-HASHMAP-3840-2
-- Attributes --
p Int PRIMARY KEY DISTRIBUTION KEY AT=FIXED ST=MEMORY

-- Indexes --
PRIMARY KEY(p) - UniqueHashIndex
PRIMARY(p) - OrderedIndex
```

You can also see the change by running the query against
[`ndbinfo.blobs`](mysql-cluster-ndbinfo-blobs.md "25.6.16.4 The ndbinfo blobs Table") again:

```sql
mysql> SELECT
    ->   column_name AS 'Column Name',
    ->   inline_size AS 'Inline Size',
    ->   part_size AS 'Blob Part Size'
    -> FROM ndbinfo.blobs
    -> WHERE table_name = 't2';
+-------------+-------------+----------------+
| Column Name | Inline Size | Blob Part Size |
+-------------+-------------+----------------+
| c1          |         256 |          13948 |
| c2          |         256 |           2000 |
+-------------+-------------+----------------+
2 rows in set (0.00 sec)
```

It is possible to set both `BLOB_INLINE_SIZE`
and `MAX_BLOB_PART_SIZE` for a blob column, as
shown in this `CREATE TABLE` statement:

```sql
mysql> CREATE TABLE test.t3 (
    ->   p INT NOT NULL PRIMARY KEY,
    ->   c1 JSON,
    ->   c2 JSON COMMENT 'NDB_COLUMN=BLOB_INLINE_SIZE=5000,MAX_BLOB_PART_SIZE'
    -> ) ENGINE NDB;
Query OK, 0 rows affected (0.28 sec)
```

Querying the [`blobs`](mysql-cluster-ndbinfo-blobs.md "25.6.16.4 The ndbinfo blobs Table") table shows
us that the statement worked as expected:

```sql
mysql> SELECT
    ->   column_name AS 'Column Name',
    ->   inline_size AS 'Inline Size',
    ->   part_size AS 'Blob Part Size'
    -> FROM ndbinfo.blobs
    -> WHERE table_name = 't3';
+-------------+-------------+----------------+
| Column Name | Inline Size | Blob Part Size |
+-------------+-------------+----------------+
| c1          |        4000 |           8100 |
| c2          |        5000 |           8100 |
+-------------+-------------+----------------+
2 rows in set (0.00 sec)
```

You can also verify that the statement worked by checking the
output of [**ndb\_desc**](mysql-cluster-programs-ndb-desc.md "25.5.9 ndb_desc — Describe NDB Tables").

Changing a column's blob part size must be done using a
copying `ALTER TABLE`; this operation cannot be
performed online (see
[Section 25.6.12, “Online Operations with ALTER TABLE in NDB Cluster”](mysql-cluster-online-operations.md "25.6.12 Online Operations with ALTER TABLE in NDB Cluster")).

For more information about how [`NDB`](mysql-cluster.md "Chapter 25 MySQL NDB Cluster 8.0")
stores columns of blob types, see
[String Type Storage Requirements](storage-requirements.md#data-types-storage-reqs-strings "String Type Storage Requirements").

##### NDB\_TABLE Options

For an NDB Cluster table, the table comment in a `CREATE
TABLE` or [`ALTER TABLE`](alter-table.md "15.1.9 ALTER TABLE Statement")
statement can also be used to specify an
`NDB_TABLE` option, which consists of one or
more name-value pairs, separated by commas if need be, following
the string `NDB_TABLE=`. Complete syntax for
names and values syntax is shown here:

```sql
COMMENT="NDB_TABLE=ndb_table_option[,ndb_table_option[,...]]"

ndb_table_option: {
    NOLOGGING={1 | 0}
  | READ_BACKUP={1 | 0}
  | PARTITION_BALANCE={FOR_RP_BY_NODE | FOR_RA_BY_NODE | FOR_RP_BY_LDM
                      | FOR_RA_BY_LDM | FOR_RA_BY_LDM_X_2
                      | FOR_RA_BY_LDM_X_3 | FOR_RA_BY_LDM_X_4}
  | FULLY_REPLICATED={1 | 0}
}
```

Spaces are not permitted within the quoted string. The string is
case-insensitive.

The four `NDB` table options that can be set as
part of a comment in this way are described in more detail in
the next few paragraphs.

`NOLOGGING`: By default, `NDB`
tables are logged, and checkpointed. This makes them durable to
whole cluster failures. Using `NOLOGGING` when
creating or altering a table means that this table is not redo
logged or included in local checkpoints. In this case, the table
is still replicated across the data nodes for high availability,
and updated using transactions, but changes made to it are not
recorded in the data node's redo logs, and its content is
not checkpointed to disk; when recovering from a cluster
failure, the cluster retains the table definition, but none of
its rows—that is, the table is empty.

Using such nonlogging tables reduces the data node's
demands on disk I/O and storage, as well as CPU for
checkpointing CPU. This may be suitable for short-lived data
which is frequently updated, and where the loss of all data in
the unlikely event of a total cluster failure is acceptable.

It is also possible to use the
[`ndb_table_no_logging`](mysql-cluster-options-variables.md#sysvar_ndb_table_no_logging) system
variable to cause any NDB tables created or altered while this
variable is in effect to behave as though it had been created
with the `NOLOGGING` comment. Unlike when using
the comment directly, there is nothing in this case in the
output of [`SHOW CREATE TABLE`](show-create-table.md "15.7.7.10 SHOW CREATE TABLE Statement") to
indicate that it is a nonlogging table. Using the table comment
approach is recommended since it offers per-table control of the
feature, and this aspect of the table schema is embedded in the
table creation statement where it can be found easily by
SQL-based tools.

`READ_BACKUP`: Setting this option to 1 has the
same effect as though
[`ndb_read_backup`](mysql-cluster-options-variables.md#sysvar_ndb_read_backup) were enabled;
enables reading from any replica. Doing so greatly improves the
performance of reads from the table at a relatively small cost
to write performance. Beginning with NDB 8.0.19, 1 is the
default for `READ_BACKUP`, and the default for
[`ndb_read_backup`](mysql-cluster-options-variables.md#sysvar_ndb_read_backup) is
`ON` (previously, read from any replica was
disabled by default).

You can set `READ_BACKUP` for an existing table
online, using an `ALTER TABLE` statement
similar to one of those shown here:

```sql
ALTER TABLE ... ALGORITHM=INPLACE, COMMENT="NDB_TABLE=READ_BACKUP=1";

ALTER TABLE ... ALGORITHM=INPLACE, COMMENT="NDB_TABLE=READ_BACKUP=0";
```

For more information about the `ALGORITHM`
option for `ALTER TABLE`, see
[Section 25.6.12, “Online Operations with ALTER TABLE in NDB Cluster”](mysql-cluster-online-operations.md "25.6.12 Online Operations with ALTER TABLE in NDB Cluster").

`PARTITION_BALANCE`: Provides additional
control over assignment and placement of partitions. The
following four schemes are supported:

1. `FOR_RP_BY_NODE`: One partition per node.

   Only one LDM on each node stores a primary partition. Each
   partition is stored in the same LDM (same ID) on all nodes.
2. `FOR_RA_BY_NODE`: One partition per node
   group.

   Each node stores a single partition, which can be either a
   primary replica or a backup replica. Each partition is
   stored in the same LDM on all nodes.
3. `FOR_RP_BY_LDM`: One partition for each LDM
   on each node; the default.

   This is the setting used if `READ_BACKUP`
   is set to 1.
4. `FOR_RA_BY_LDM`: One partition per LDM in
   each node group.

   These partitions can be primary or backup partitions.
5. `FOR_RA_BY_LDM_X_2`: Two partitions per LDM
   in each node group.

   These partitions can be primary or backup partitions.
6. `FOR_RA_BY_LDM_X_3`: Three partitions per
   LDM in each node group.

   These partitions can be primary or backup partitions.
7. `FOR_RA_BY_LDM_X_4`: Four partitions per
   LDM in each node group.

   These partitions can be primary or backup partitions.

`PARTITION_BALANCE` is the preferred interface
for setting the number of partitions per table. Using
`MAX_ROWS` to force the number of partitions is
deprecated but continues to be supported for backward
compatibility; it is subject to removal in a future release of
MySQL NDB Cluster. (Bug #81759, Bug #23544301)

`FULLY_REPLICATED` controls whether the table
is fully replicated, that is, whether each data node has a
complete copy of the table. To enable full replication of the
table, use `FULLY_REPLICATED=1`.

This setting can also be controlled using the
`ndb_fully_replicated` system variable. Setting
it to `ON` enables the option by default for
all new `NDB` tables; the default is
`OFF`. The
[`ndb_data_node_neighbour`](mysql-cluster-options-variables.md#sysvar_ndb_data_node_neighbour) system
variable is also used for fully replicated tables, to ensure
that when a fully replicated table is accessed, we access the
data node which is local to this MySQL Server.

An example of a `CREATE TABLE` statement using
such a comment when creating an `NDB` table is
shown here:

```sql
mysql> CREATE TABLE t1 (
     >     c1 INT NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
     >     c2 VARCHAR(100),
     >     c3 VARCHAR(100) )
     > ENGINE=NDB
     >
COMMENT="NDB_TABLE=READ_BACKUP=0,PARTITION_BALANCE=FOR_RP_BY_NODE";
```

The comment is displayed as part of the output of
[`SHOW CREATE TABLE`](show-create-table.md "15.7.7.10 SHOW CREATE TABLE Statement"). The text of
the comment is also available from querying the MySQL
Information Schema [`TABLES`](information-schema-tables-table.md "28.3.38 The INFORMATION_SCHEMA TABLES Table") table, as
in this example:

```sql
mysql> SELECT TABLE_NAME, TABLE_SCHEMA, TABLE_COMMENT
     > FROM INFORMATION_SCHEMA.TABLES WHERE TABLE_NAME="t1"\G
*************************** 1. row ***************************
   TABLE_NAME: t1
 TABLE_SCHEMA: test
TABLE_COMMENT: NDB_TABLE=READ_BACKUP=0,PARTITION_BALANCE=FOR_RP_BY_NODE
1 row in set (0.01 sec)
```

This comment syntax is also supported with
[`ALTER TABLE`](alter-table.md "15.1.9 ALTER TABLE Statement") statements for
`NDB` tables, as shown here:

```sql
mysql> ALTER TABLE t1 COMMENT="NDB_TABLE=PARTITION_BALANCE=FOR_RA_BY_NODE";
Query OK, 0 rows affected (0.40 sec)
Records: 0  Duplicates: 0  Warnings: 0
```

Beginning with NDB 8.0.21, the `TABLE_COMMENT`
column displays the comment that is required to re-create the
table as it is following the `ALTER TABLE`
statement, like this:

```sql
mysql> SELECT TABLE_NAME, TABLE_SCHEMA, TABLE_COMMENT
    ->     FROM INFORMATION_SCHEMA.TABLES WHERE TABLE_NAME="t1"\G
*************************** 1. row ***************************
   TABLE_NAME: t1
 TABLE_SCHEMA: test
TABLE_COMMENT: NDB_TABLE=READ_BACKUP=0,PARTITION_BALANCE=FOR_RP_BY_NODE
1 row in set (0.01 sec)
```

```sql
mysql> SELECT TABLE_NAME, TABLE_SCHEMA, TABLE_COMMENT
     > FROM INFORMATION_SCHEMA.TABLES WHERE TABLE_NAME="t1";
+------------+--------------+--------------------------------------------------+
| TABLE_NAME | TABLE_SCHEMA | TABLE_COMMENT                                    |
+------------+--------------+--------------------------------------------------+
| t1         | c            | NDB_TABLE=PARTITION_BALANCE=FOR_RA_BY_NODE       |
| t1         | d            |                                                  |
+------------+--------------+--------------------------------------------------+
2 rows in set (0.01 sec)
```

Keep in mind that a table comment used with `ALTER
TABLE` replaces any existing comment which the table
might have.

```sql
mysql> ALTER TABLE t1 COMMENT="NDB_TABLE=PARTITION_BALANCE=FOR_RA_BY_NODE";
Query OK, 0 rows affected (0.40 sec)
Records: 0  Duplicates: 0  Warnings: 0

mysql> SELECT TABLE_NAME, TABLE_SCHEMA, TABLE_COMMENT
     > FROM INFORMATION_SCHEMA.TABLES WHERE TABLE_NAME="t1";
+------------+--------------+--------------------------------------------------+
| TABLE_NAME | TABLE_SCHEMA | TABLE_COMMENT                                    |
+------------+--------------+--------------------------------------------------+
| t1         | c            | NDB_TABLE=PARTITION_BALANCE=FOR_RA_BY_NODE       |
| t1         | d            |                                                  |
+------------+--------------+--------------------------------------------------+
2 rows in set (0.01 sec)
```

Prior to NDB 8.0.21, the table comment used with `ALTER
TABLE` replaced any existing comment which the table
might have had. This meant that (for example) the
`READ_BACKUP` value was not carried over to the
new comment set by the `ALTER TABLE` statement,
and that any unspecified values reverted to their defaults.
(BUG#30428829) There was thus no longer any way using SQL to
retrieve the value previously set for the comment. To keep
comment values from reverting to their defaults, it was
necessary to preserve any such values from the existing comment
string and include them in the comment passed to `ALTER
TABLE`.

You can also see the value of the
`PARTITION_BALANCE` option in the output of
[**ndb\_desc**](mysql-cluster-programs-ndb-desc.md "25.5.9 ndb_desc — Describe NDB Tables"). [**ndb\_desc**](mysql-cluster-programs-ndb-desc.md "25.5.9 ndb_desc — Describe NDB Tables") also
shows whether the `READ_BACKUP` and
`FULLY_REPLICATED` options are set for the
table. See the description of this program for more information.
