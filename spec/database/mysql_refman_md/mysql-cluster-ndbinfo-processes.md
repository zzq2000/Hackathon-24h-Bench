#### 25.6.16.50 The ndbinfo processes Table

This table contains information about NDB Cluster node
processes; each node is represented by the row in the table.
Only nodes that are connected to the cluster are shown in this
table. You can obtain information about nodes that are
configured but not connected to the cluster from the
[`nodes`](mysql-cluster-ndbinfo-nodes.md "25.6.16.47 The ndbinfo nodes Table") and
[`config_nodes`](mysql-cluster-ndbinfo-config-nodes.md "25.6.16.9 The ndbinfo config_nodes Table") tables.

The `processes` table contains the following
columns:

- `node_id`

  The node's unique node ID in the cluster
- `node_type`

  Type of node (management, data, or API node; see text)
- `node_version`

  Version of the `NDB` software program
  running on this node.
- `process_id`

  This node's process ID
- `angel_process_id`

  Process ID of this node's angel process
- `process_name`

  Name of the executable
- `service_URI`

  Service URI of this node (see text)

##### Notes

`node_id` is the ID assigned to this node in
the cluster.

The `node_type` column displays one of the
following three values:

- `MGM`: Management node.
- `NDB`: Data node.
- `API`: API or SQL node.

For an executable shipped with the NDB Cluster distribution,
`node_version` shows the software Cluster
version string, such as
`8.0.44-ndb-8.0.44`.

`process_id` is the node executable's
process ID as shown by the host operating system using a process
display application such as **top** on Linux, or
the Task Manager on Windows platforms.

`angel_process_id` is the system process ID for
the node's angel process, which ensures that a data node or
SQL is automatically restarted in cases of failures. For
management nodes and API nodes other than SQL nodes, the value
of this column is `NULL`.

The `process_name` column shows the name of the
running executable. For management nodes, this is
`ndb_mgmd`. For data nodes, this is
`ndbd` (single-threaded) or
`ndbmtd` (multithreaded). For SQL nodes, this
is `mysqld`. For other types of API nodes, it
is the name of the executable program connected to the cluster;
NDB API applications can set a custom value for this using
[`Ndb_cluster_connection::set_name()`](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/ndbapi/en/ndb-ndb-cluster-connection.html#ndb-ndb-cluster-connection-set-name).

`service_URI` shows the service network
address. For management nodes and data nodes, the scheme used is
`ndb://`. For SQL nodes, this is
`mysql://`. By default, API nodes other than
SQL nodes use `ndb://` for the scheme; NDB API
applications can set this to a custom value using
`Ndb_cluster_connection::set_service_uri()`.
regardless of the node type, the scheme is followed by the IP
address used by the NDB transporter for the node in question.
For management nodes and SQL nodes, this address includes the
port number (usually 1186 for management nodes and 3306 for SQL
nodes). If the SQL node was started with the
[`bind_address`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_bind_address) system variable
set, this address is used instead of the transporter address,
unless the bind address is set to `*`,
`0.0.0.0`, or `::`.

Additional path information may be included in the
`service_URI` value for an SQL node reflecting
various configuration options. For example,
`mysql://198.51.100.3/tmp/mysql.sock` indicates
that the SQL node was started with the
[`skip_networking`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_skip_networking) system variable
enabled, and
`mysql://198.51.100.3:3306/?server-id=1` shows
that replication is enabled for this SQL node.
