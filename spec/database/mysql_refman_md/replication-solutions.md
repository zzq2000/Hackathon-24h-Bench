Replication can be used in many different environments for a range
of purposes. This section provides general notes and advice on using
replication for specific solution types.

For information on using replication in a backup environment,
including notes on the setup, backup procedure, and files to back
up, see [Section 19.4.1, “Using Replication for Backups”](replication-solutions-backups.md "19.4.1 Using Replication for Backups").

For advice and tips on using different storage engines on the source
and replica, see
[Section 19.4.4, “Using Replication with Different Source and Replica Storage Engines”](replication-solutions-diffengines.md "19.4.4 Using Replication with Different Source and Replica Storage Engines").

Using replication as a scale-out solution requires some changes in
the logic and operation of applications that use the solution. See
[Section 19.4.5, “Using Replication for Scale-Out”](replication-solutions-scaleout.md "19.4.5 Using Replication for Scale-Out").

For performance or data distribution reasons, you may want to
replicate different databases to different replicas. See
[Section 19.4.6, “Replicating Different Databases to Different Replicas”](replication-solutions-partitioning.md "19.4.6 Replicating Different Databases to Different Replicas")

As the number of replicas increases, the load on the source can
increase and lead to reduced performance (because of the need to
replicate the binary log to each replica). For tips on improving
your replication performance, including using a single secondary
server as the source, see
[Section 19.4.7, “Improving Replication Performance”](replication-solutions-performance.md "19.4.7 Improving Replication Performance").

For guidance on switching sources, or converting replicas into
sources as part of an emergency failover solution, see
[Section 19.4.8, “Switching Sources During Failover”](replication-solutions-switch.md "19.4.8 Switching Sources During Failover").

For information on security measures specific to servers in a
replication topology, see [Section 19.3, “Replication Security”](replication-security.md "19.3 Replication Security").
