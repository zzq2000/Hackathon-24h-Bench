#### B.3.3.5 Where MySQL Stores Temporary Files

On Unix, MySQL uses the value of the `TMPDIR`
environment variable as the path name of the directory in
which to store temporary files. If `TMPDIR`
is not set, MySQL uses the system default, which is usually
`/tmp`, `/var/tmp`, or
`/usr/tmp`.

On Windows, MySQL checks in order the values of the
`TMPDIR`, `TEMP`, and
`TMP` environment variables. For the first
one found to be set, MySQL uses it and does not check those
remaining. If none of `TMPDIR`,
`TEMP`, or `TMP` are set,
MySQL uses the Windows system default, which is usually
`C:\windows\temp\`.

If the file system containing your temporary file directory is
too small, you can use the [**mysqld**](mysqld.md "6.3.1 mysqld — The MySQL Server")
[`--tmpdir`](server-options.md#option_mysqld_tmpdir) option to specify a
directory in a file system where you have enough space.

The [`--tmpdir`](server-options.md#option_mysqld_tmpdir) option can be set
to a list of several paths that are used in round-robin
fashion. Paths should be separated by colon characters
(`:`) on Unix and semicolon characters
(`;`) on Windows.

Note

To spread the load effectively, these paths should be
located on different *physical* disks,
not different partitions of the same disk.

If the MySQL server is acting as a replica, you can set the
system variable
[`replica_load_tmpdir`](replication-options-replica.md#sysvar_replica_load_tmpdir) (from
MySQL 8.0.26) or
[`slave_load_tmpdir`](replication-options-replica.md#sysvar_slave_load_tmpdir) (before
MySQL 8.0.26) to specify a separate directory for holding
temporary files when replicating [`LOAD
DATA`](load-data.md "15.2.9 LOAD DATA Statement") statements. This directory should be in a
disk-based file system (not a memory-based file system) so
that the temporary files used to replicate LOAD DATA can
survive machine restarts. The directory also should not be one
that is cleared by the operating system during the system
startup process. However, replication can now continue after a
restart if the temporary files have been removed.

MySQL arranges that temporary files are removed if
[**mysqld**](mysqld.md "6.3.1 mysqld — The MySQL Server") is terminated. On platforms that
support it (such as Unix), this is done by unlinking the file
after opening it. The disadvantage of this is that the name
does not appear in directory listings and you do not see a big
temporary file that fills up the file system in which the
temporary file directory is located. (In such cases,
**lsof +L1** may be helpful in identifying
large files associated with [**mysqld**](mysqld.md "6.3.1 mysqld — The MySQL Server").)

When sorting (`ORDER BY` or `GROUP
BY`), MySQL normally uses one or two temporary files.
The maximum disk space required is determined by the following
expression:

```clike
(length of what is sorted + sizeof(row pointer))
* number of matched rows
* 2
```

The row pointer size is usually four bytes, but may grow in
the future for really big tables.

For some statements, MySQL creates temporary SQL tables that
are not hidden and have names that begin with
`#sql`.

Some [`SELECT`](select.md "15.2.13 SELECT Statement") queries creates
temporary SQL tables to hold intermediate results.

DDL operations that rebuild the table and are not performed
online using the `ALGORITHM=INPLACE`
technique create a temporary copy of the original table in the
same directory as the original table.

Online DDL operations may use temporary log files for
recording concurrent DML, temporary sort files when creating
an index, and temporary intermediate tables files when
rebuilding the table. For more information, see
[Section 17.12.3, “Online DDL Space Requirements”](innodb-online-ddl-space-requirements.md "17.12.3 Online DDL Space Requirements").

`InnoDB` user-created temporary tables and
on-disk internal temporary tables are created in a temporary
tablespace file named `ibtmp1` in the MySQL
data directory. For more information, see
[Section 17.6.3.5, “Temporary Tablespaces”](innodb-temporary-tablespace.md "17.6.3.5 Temporary Tablespaces").

[Section 17.15.7, “InnoDB INFORMATION\_SCHEMA Temporary Table Info Table”](innodb-information-schema-temp-table-info.md "17.15.7 InnoDB INFORMATION_SCHEMA Temporary Table Info Table").

The optional `EXTENDED` modifier causes
[`SHOW TABLES`](show-tables.md "15.7.7.39 SHOW TABLES Statement") to list hidden
tables created by failed [`ALTER
TABLE`](alter-table.md "15.1.9 ALTER TABLE Statement") statements. See [Section 15.7.7.39, “SHOW TABLES Statement”](show-tables.md "15.7.7.39 SHOW TABLES Statement").
