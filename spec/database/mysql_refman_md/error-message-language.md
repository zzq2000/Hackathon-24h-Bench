## 12.12 Setting the Error Message Language

By default, [**mysqld**](mysqld.md "6.3.1 mysqld — The MySQL Server") produces error messages in
English, but they can be displayed instead in any of several other
languages: Czech, Danish, Dutch, Estonian, French, German, Greek,
Hungarian, Italian, Japanese, Korean, Norwegian, Norwegian-ny,
Polish, Portuguese, Romanian, Russian, Slovak, Spanish, or
Swedish. This applies to messages the server writes to the error
log and sends to clients.

To select the language in which the server writes error messages,
follow the instructions in this section. For information about
changing the character set for error messages (rather than the
language), see [Section 12.6, “Error Message Character Set”](charset-errors.md "12.6 Error Message Character Set"). For general
information about configuring error logging, see
[Section 7.4.2, “The Error Log”](error-log.md "7.4.2 The Error Log").

The server searches for the error message file using these rules:

- It looks for the file in a directory constructed from two
  system variable values,
  [`lc_messages_dir`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_lc_messages_dir) and
  [`lc_messages`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_lc_messages), with the latter
  converted to a language name. Suppose that you start the
  server using this command:

  ```terminal
  mysqld --lc_messages_dir=/usr/share/mysql --lc_messages=fr_FR
  ```

  In this case, [**mysqld**](mysqld.md "6.3.1 mysqld — The MySQL Server") maps the locale
  `fr_FR` to the language
  `french` and looks for the error file in the
  `/usr/share/mysql/french` directory.

  By default, the language files are located in the
  `share/mysql/LANGUAGE`
  directory under the MySQL base directory.
- If the message file cannot be found in the directory
  constructed as just described, the server ignores the
  [`lc_messages`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_lc_messages) value and uses
  only the [`lc_messages_dir`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_lc_messages_dir)
  value as the location in which to look.
- If the server cannot find the configured message file, it
  writes a message to the error log to indicate the problem and
  defaults to built-in English messages.

The [`lc_messages_dir`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_lc_messages_dir) system
variable can be set only at server startup and has only a global
read-only value at runtime.
[`lc_messages`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_lc_messages) can be set at server
startup and has global and session values that can be modified at
runtime. Thus, the error message language can be changed while the
server is running, and each client can have its own error message
language by setting its session
[`lc_messages`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_lc_messages) value to the desired
locale name. For example, if the server is using the
`fr_FR` locale for error messages, a client can
execute this statement to receive error messages in English:

```sql
SET lc_messages = 'en_US';
```
