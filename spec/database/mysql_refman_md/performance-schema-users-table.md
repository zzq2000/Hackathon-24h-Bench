#### 29.12.8.3 The users Table

The [`users`](performance-schema-users-table.md "29.12.8.3 The users Table") table contains a row
for each user who has connected to the MySQL server. For each
user name, the table counts the current and total number of
connections. The table size is autosized at server startup. To
set the table size explicitly, set the
[`performance_schema_users_size`](performance-schema-system-variables.md#sysvar_performance_schema_users_size)
system variable at server startup. To disable user statistics,
set this variable to 0.

The [`users`](performance-schema-users-table.md "29.12.8.3 The users Table") table has the following
