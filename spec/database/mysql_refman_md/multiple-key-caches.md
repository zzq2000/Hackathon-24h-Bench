#### 10.10.2.2 Multiple Key Caches

Note

As of MySQL 8.0, the compound-part
structured-variable syntax discussed here for referring to
multiple `MyISAM` key caches is deprecated.

Shared access to the key cache improves performance but does
not eliminate contention among sessions entirely. They still
compete for control structures that manage access to the key
cache buffers. To reduce key cache access contention further,
MySQL also provides multiple key caches. This feature enables
you to assign different table indexes to different key caches.

Where there are multiple key caches, the server must know
which cache to use when processing queries for a given
`MyISAM` table. By default, all
`MyISAM` table indexes are cached in the
default key cache. To assign table indexes to a specific key
cache, use the [`CACHE INDEX`](cache-index.md "15.7.8.2 CACHE INDEX Statement")
statement (see [Section 15.7.8.2, “CACHE INDEX Statement”](cache-index.md "15.7.8.2 CACHE INDEX Statement")). For example,
the following statement assigns indexes from the tables
`t1`, `t2`, and
`t3` to the key cache named
`hot_cache`:

```sql
mysql> CACHE INDEX t1, t2, t3 IN hot_cache;
+---------+--------------------+----------+----------+
| Table   | Op                 | Msg_type | Msg_text |
+---------+--------------------+----------+----------+
| test.t1 | assign_to_keycache | status   | OK       |
| test.t2 | assign_to_keycache | status   | OK       |
| test.t3 | assign_to_keycache | status   | OK       |
+---------+--------------------+----------+----------+
```

The key cache referred to in a [`CACHE
INDEX`](cache-index.md "15.7.8.2 CACHE INDEX Statement") statement can be created by setting its size
with a [`SET
GLOBAL`](set-variable.md "15.7.6.1 SET Syntax for Variable Assignment") parameter setting statement or by using
server startup options. For example:

```sql
mysql> SET GLOBAL keycache1.key_buffer_size=128*1024;
```

To destroy a key cache, set its size to zero:

```sql
mysql> SET GLOBAL keycache1.key_buffer_size=0;
```

You cannot destroy the default key cache. Any attempt to do
this is ignored:

```sql
mysql> SET GLOBAL key_buffer_size = 0;

mysql> SHOW VARIABLES LIKE 'key_buffer_size';
+-----------------+---------+
| Variable_name   | Value   |
+-----------------+---------+
| key_buffer_size | 8384512 |
+-----------------+---------+
```

Key cache variables are structured system variables that have
a name and components. For
`keycache1.key_buffer_size`,
`keycache1` is the cache variable name and
[`key_buffer_size`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_key_buffer_size) is the cache
component. See [Section 7.1.9.5, “Structured System Variables”](structured-system-variables.md "7.1.9.5 Structured System Variables"),
for a description of the syntax used for referring to
structured key cache system variables.

By default, table indexes are assigned to the main (default)
key cache created at the server startup. When a key cache is
destroyed, all indexes assigned to it are reassigned to the
default key cache.

For a busy server, you can use a strategy that involves three
key caches:

- A “hot” key cache that takes up 20% of the
  space allocated for all key caches. Use this for tables
  that are heavily used for searches but that are not
  updated.
- A “cold” key cache that takes up 20% of the
  space allocated for all key caches. Use this cache for
  medium-sized, intensively modified tables, such as
  temporary tables.
- A “warm” key cache that takes up 60% of the
  key cache space. Employ this as the default key cache, to
  be used by default for all other tables.

One reason the use of three key caches is beneficial is that
access to one key cache structure does not block access to the
others. Statements that access tables assigned to one cache do
not compete with statements that access tables assigned to
another cache. Performance gains occur for other reasons as
well:

- The hot cache is used only for retrieval queries, so its
  contents are never modified. Consequently, whenever an
  index block needs to be pulled in from disk, the contents
  of the cache block chosen for replacement need not be
  flushed first.
- For an index assigned to the hot cache, if there are no
  queries requiring an index scan, there is a high
  probability that the index blocks corresponding to nonleaf
  nodes of the index B-tree remain in the cache.
- An update operation most frequently executed for temporary
  tables is performed much faster when the updated node is
  in the cache and need not be read from disk first. If the
  size of the indexes of the temporary tables are comparable
  with the size of cold key cache, the probability is very
  high that the updated node is in the cache.

The [`CACHE INDEX`](cache-index.md "15.7.8.2 CACHE INDEX Statement") statement sets
up an association between a table and a key cache, but the
association is lost each time the server restarts. If you want
the association to take effect each time the server starts,
one way to accomplish this is to use an option file: Include
variable settings that configure your key caches, and an
[`init_file`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_init_file) system variable
that names a file containing [`CACHE
INDEX`](cache-index.md "15.7.8.2 CACHE INDEX Statement") statements to be executed. For example:

```ini
key_buffer_size = 4G
hot_cache.key_buffer_size = 2G
cold_cache.key_buffer_size = 2G
init_file=/path/to/data-directory/mysqld_init.sql
```

The statements in `mysqld_init.sql` are
executed each time the server starts. The file should contain
one SQL statement per line. The following example assigns
several tables each to `hot_cache` and
`cold_cache`:

```sql
CACHE INDEX db1.t1, db1.t2, db2.t3 IN hot_cache
CACHE INDEX db1.t4, db2.t5, db2.t6 IN cold_cache
```
