### 29.4.7 Pre-Filtering by Consumer

The [`setup_consumers`](performance-schema-setup-consumers-table.md "29.12.2.2 The setup_consumers Table") table lists the
available consumer types and which are enabled:

```sql
mysql> SELECT * FROM performance_schema.setup_consumers;
+----------------------------------+---------+
| NAME                             | ENABLED |
+----------------------------------+---------+
| events_stages_current            | NO      |
| events_stages_history            | NO      |
| events_stages_history_long       | NO      |
| events_statements_cpu            | NO      |
| events_statements_current        | YES     |
| events_statements_history        | YES     |
| events_statements_history_long   | NO      |
| events_transactions_current      | YES     |
| events_transactions_history      | YES     |
| events_transactions_history_long | NO      |
| events_waits_current             | NO      |
| events_waits_history             | NO      |
| events_waits_history_long        | NO      |
| global_instrumentation           | YES     |
| thread_instrumentation           | YES     |
| statements_digest                | YES     |
+----------------------------------+---------+
```

Modify the [`setup_consumers`](performance-schema-setup-consumers-table.md "29.12.2.2 The setup_consumers Table") table to
affect pre-filtering at the consumer stage and determine the
destinations to which events are sent. To enable or disable a
consumer, set its `ENABLED` value to
`YES` or `NO`.

Modifications to the
[`setup_consumers`](performance-schema-setup-consumers-table.md "29.12.2.2 The setup_consumers Table") table affect
monitoring immediately.

If you disable a consumer, the server does not spend time
maintaining destinations for that consumer. For example, if you
do not care about historical event information, disable the
history consumers:

```sql
UPDATE performance_schema.setup_consumers
SET ENABLED = 'NO'
WHERE NAME LIKE '%history%';
```

The consumer settings in the
[`setup_consumers`](performance-schema-setup-consumers-table.md "29.12.2.2 The setup_consumers Table") table form a
hierarchy from higher levels to lower. The following principles
apply:

- Destinations associated with a consumer receive no events
  unless the Performance Schema checks the consumer and the
  consumer is enabled.
- A consumer is checked only if all consumers it depends on
  (if any) are enabled.
- If a consumer is not checked, or is checked but is disabled,
  other consumers that depend on it are not checked.
- Dependent consumers may have their own dependent consumers.
- If an event would not be sent to any destination, the
  Performance Schema does not produce it.

The following lists describe the available consumer values. For
discussion of several representative consumer configurations and
their effect on instrumentation, see
[Section 29.4.8, “Example Consumer Configurations”](performance-schema-consumer-configurations.md "29.4.8 Example Consumer Configurations").

- [Global and Thread Consumers](performance-schema-consumer-filtering.md#performance-schema-consumer-filtering-global-thread "Global and Thread Consumers")
- [Wait Event Consumers](performance-schema-consumer-filtering.md#performance-schema-consumer-filtering-wait-event "Wait Event Consumers")
- [Stage Event Consumers](performance-schema-consumer-filtering.md#performance-schema-consumer-filtering-stage-event "Stage Event Consumers")
- [Statement Event Consumers](performance-schema-consumer-filtering.md#performance-schema-consumer-filtering-statement-event "Statement Event Consumers")
- [Transaction Event Consumers](performance-schema-consumer-filtering.md#performance-schema-consumer-filtering-transaction-event "Transaction Event Consumers")
- [Statement Digest Consumer](performance-schema-consumer-filtering.md#performance-schema-consumer-filtering-statement-digest "Statement Digest Consumer")

#### Global and Thread Consumers

- `global_instrumentation` is the highest
  level consumer. If
  `global_instrumentation` is
  `NO`, it disables global instrumentation.
  All other settings are lower level and are not checked; it
  does not matter what they are set to. No global or per
  thread information is maintained and no individual events
  are collected in the current-events or event-history
  tables. If `global_instrumentation` is
  `YES`, the Performance Schema maintains
  information for global states and also checks the
  `thread_instrumentation` consumer.
- `thread_instrumentation` is checked only
  if `global_instrumentation` is
  `YES`. Otherwise, if
  `thread_instrumentation` is
  `NO`, it disables thread-specific
  instrumentation and all lower-level settings are ignored.
  No information is maintained per thread and no individual
  events are collected in the current-events or
  event-history tables. If
  `thread_instrumentation` is
  `YES`, the Performance Schema maintains
  thread-specific information and also checks
  `events_xxx_current`
  consumers.

#### Wait Event Consumers

These consumers require both
`global_instrumentation` and
`thread_instrumentation` to be
`YES` or they are not checked. If checked,
they act as follows:

- `events_waits_current`, if
  `NO`, disables collection of individual
  wait events in the
  [`events_waits_current`](performance-schema-events-waits-current-table.md "29.12.4.1 The events_waits_current Table") table.
  If `YES`, it enables wait event
  collection and the Performance Schema checks the
  `events_waits_history` and
  `events_waits_history_long` consumers.
- `events_waits_history` is not checked if
  `event_waits_current` is
  `NO`. Otherwise, an
  `events_waits_history` value of
  `NO` or `YES` disables
  or enables collection of wait events in the
  [`events_waits_history`](performance-schema-events-waits-history-table.md "29.12.4.2 The events_waits_history Table") table.
- `events_waits_history_long` is not
  checked if `event_waits_current` is
  `NO`. Otherwise, an
  `events_waits_history_long` value of
  `NO` or `YES` disables
  or enables collection of wait events in the
  [`events_waits_history_long`](performance-schema-events-waits-history-long-table.md "29.12.4.3 The events_waits_history_long Table")
  table.

#### Stage Event Consumers

These consumers require both
`global_instrumentation` and
`thread_instrumentation` to be
`YES` or they are not checked. If checked,
they act as follows:

- `events_stages_current`, if
  `NO`, disables collection of individual
  stage events in the
  [`events_stages_current`](performance-schema-events-stages-current-table.md "29.12.5.1 The events_stages_current Table") table.
  If `YES`, it enables stage event
  collection and the Performance Schema checks the
  `events_stages_history` and
  `events_stages_history_long` consumers.
- `events_stages_history` is not checked if
  `event_stages_current` is
  `NO`. Otherwise, an
  `events_stages_history` value of
  `NO` or `YES` disables
  or enables collection of stage events in the
  [`events_stages_history`](performance-schema-events-stages-history-table.md "29.12.5.2 The events_stages_history Table") table.
- `events_stages_history_long` is not
  checked if `event_stages_current` is
  `NO`. Otherwise, an
  `events_stages_history_long` value of
  `NO` or `YES` disables
  or enables collection of stage events in the
  [`events_stages_history_long`](performance-schema-events-stages-history-long-table.md "29.12.5.3 The events_stages_history_long Table")
  table.

#### Statement Event Consumers

These consumers require both
`global_instrumentation` and
`thread_instrumentation` to be
`YES` or they are not checked. If checked,
they act as follows:

- `events_statements_cpu`, if
  `NO`, disables measurement of
  `CPU_TIME`. If `YES`,
  and the instrumentation is enabled and timed,
  `CPU_TIME` is measured.
- `events_statements_current`, if
  `NO`, disables collection of individual
  statement events in the
  [`events_statements_current`](performance-schema-events-statements-current-table.md "29.12.6.1 The events_statements_current Table")
  table. If `YES`, it enables statement
  event collection and the Performance Schema checks the
  `events_statements_history` and
  `events_statements_history_long`
  consumers.
- `events_statements_history` is not
  checked if `events_statements_current` is
  `NO`. Otherwise, an
  `events_statements_history` value of
  `NO` or `YES` disables
  or enables collection of statement events in the
  [`events_statements_history`](performance-schema-events-statements-history-table.md "29.12.6.2 The events_statements_history Table")
  table.
- `events_statements_history_long` is not
  checked if `events_statements_current` is
  `NO`. Otherwise, an
  `events_statements_history_long` value of
  `NO` or `YES` disables
  or enables collection of statement events in the
  [`events_statements_history_long`](performance-schema-events-statements-history-long-table.md "29.12.6.3 The events_statements_history_long Table")
  table.

#### Transaction Event Consumers

These consumers require both
`global_instrumentation` and
`thread_instrumentation` to be
`YES` or they are not checked. If checked,
they act as follows:

- `events_transactions_current`, if
  `NO`, disables collection of individual
  transaction events in the
  [`events_transactions_current`](performance-schema-events-transactions-current-table.md "29.12.7.1 The events_transactions_current Table")
  table. If `YES`, it enables transaction
  event collection and the Performance Schema checks the
  `events_transactions_history` and
  `events_transactions_history_long`
  consumers.
- `events_transactions_history` is not
  checked if `events_transactions_current`
  is `NO`. Otherwise, an
  `events_transactions_history` value of
  `NO` or `YES` disables
  or enables collection of transaction events in the
  [`events_transactions_history`](performance-schema-events-transactions-history-table.md "29.12.7.2 The events_transactions_history Table")
  table.
- `events_transactions_history_long` is not
  checked if `events_transactions_current`
  is `NO`. Otherwise, an
  `events_transactions_history_long` value
  of `NO` or `YES`
  disables or enables collection of transaction events in
  the
  [`events_transactions_history_long`](performance-schema-events-transactions-history-long-table.md "29.12.7.3 The events_transactions_history_long Table")
  table.

#### Statement Digest Consumer

The `statements_digest` consumer requires
`global_instrumentation` to be
`YES` or it is not checked. There is no
dependency on the statement event consumers, so you can obtain
statistics per digest without having to collect statistics in
[`events_statements_current`](performance-schema-events-statements-current-table.md "29.12.6.1 The events_statements_current Table"), which
is advantageous in terms of overhead. Conversely, you can get
detailed statements in
[`events_statements_current`](performance-schema-events-statements-current-table.md "29.12.6.1 The events_statements_current Table") without
digests (the `DIGEST` and
`DIGEST_TEXT` columns are
`NULL` in this case).

For more information about statement digesting, see
[Section 29.10, “Performance Schema Statement Digests and Sampling”](performance-schema-statement-digests.md "29.10 Performance Schema Statement Digests and Sampling").
