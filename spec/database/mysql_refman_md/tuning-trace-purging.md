### 10.15.4 Tuning Trace Purging

By default, each new trace overwrites the previous trace. Thus, if
a statement contains substatements (such as invoking stored
procedures, stored functions, or triggers), the topmost statement
and substatements each generate one trace, but at the end of
execution, the trace for only the last substatement is visible.

A user who wants to see the trace of a different substatement can
enable or disable tracing for the desired substatement, but this
requires editing the routine code, which may not always be
possible. Another solution is to tune trace purging. This is done
by setting the
[`optimizer_trace_offset`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_optimizer_trace_offset) and
[`optimizer_trace_limit`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_optimizer_trace_limit) system
variables, like this:

```sql
SET optimizer_trace_offset=offset, optimizer_trace_limit=limit;
```

*`offset`* is a signed integer (default
`-1`); *`limit`* is a
positive integer (default `1`). Such a
[`SET`](set.md "13.3.6 The SET Type") statement has the following
effects:

- All traces previously stored are cleared from memory.
- A subsequent [`SELECT`](select.md "15.2.13 SELECT Statement") from the
  [`OPTIMIZER_TRACE`](information-schema-optimizer-trace-table.md "28.3.19 The INFORMATION_SCHEMA OPTIMIZER_TRACE Table") table returns the
  first *`limit`* traces of the
  *`offset`* oldest stored traces (if
  *`offset`* >= 0), or the first
  *`limit`* traces of the
  *`-offset`* newest stored traces (if
  *`offset`* < 0).

Examples:

- `SET optimizer_trace_offset=-1,
  optimizer_trace_limit=1`: The most recent trace is
  shown (the default).
- `SET optimizer_trace_offset=-2,
  optimizer_trace_limit=1`: The next-to-last trace is
  shown.
- `SET optimizer_trace_offset=-5,
  optimizer_trace_limit=5`: The last five traces are
  shown.

Negative values for *`offset`* can thus
prove useful when the substatements of interest are the last few
in a stored routine. For example:

```sql
SET optimizer_trace_offset=-5, optimizer_trace_limit=5;

CALL stored_routine(); # more than 5 substatements in this routine

SELECT * FROM information_schema.OPTIMIZER_TRACE; # see only the last 5 traces
```

A positive *`offset`* can be useful when
one knows that the interesting substatements are the first few in
a stored routine.

The more accurately these two variables are set, the less memory
is used. For example, `SET optimizer_trace_offset=0,
optimizer_trace_limit=5` requires sufficient memory to
store five traces, so if only the three first are needed, is is
better to use `SET optimizer_trace_offset=0,
optimizer_trace_limit=3`, since tracing stops after
*`limit`* traces. A stored routine may have
a loop which executes many substatements and thus generates many
traces, which can use a lot of memory; in such cases, choosing
appropriate values for *`offset`* and
*`limit`* can restrict tracing to, for
example, a single iteration of the loop. This also decreases the
impact of tracing on execution speed.

If *`offset`* is greater than or equal to
0, only *`limit`* traces are kept in
memory. If *`offset`* is less than 0, that
is not true: instead, *`-offset`* traces
are kept in memory. Even if *`limit`* is
smaller than *`-offset`*, excluding the
last statement, the last statement must still be traced because it
will be within the limit after executing one more statement. Since
an offset less than 0 is counted from the end, the
“window” moves as more statements execute.

Using `optimizer_trace_offset` and
`optimizer_trace_limit`, which are restrictions
at the trace producer level, provide better (greater) speed and
(less) memory usage than setting offsets or limits at the trace
consumer (SQL) level with `SELECT * FROM OPTIMIZER_TRACE
LIMIT limit OFFSET
offset`, which saves almost
nothing.
