## 1.5 How to Report Bugs or Problems

Before posting a bug report about a problem, please try to verify
that it is a bug and that it has not been reported already:

- Start by searching the MySQL online manual at
  <https://dev.mysql.com/doc/>. We try to keep the manual up to
  date by updating it frequently with solutions to newly found
  problems. In addition, the release notes accompanying the manual
  can be particularly useful since it is quite possible that a
  newer version contains a solution to your problem. The release
  notes are available at the location just given for the manual.
- If you get a parse error for an SQL statement, please check your
  syntax closely. If you cannot find something wrong with it, it
  is extremely likely that your current version of MySQL Server
  doesn't support the syntax you are using. If you are using the
  current version and the manual doesn't cover the syntax that you
  are using, MySQL Server doesn't support your statement.

  If the manual covers the syntax you are using, but you have an
  older version of MySQL Server, you should check the MySQL change
  history to see when the syntax was implemented. In this case,
  you have the option of upgrading to a newer version of MySQL
  Server.
- For solutions to some common problems, see
  [Section B.3, “Problems and Common Errors”](problems.md "B.3 Problems and Common Errors").
- Search the bugs database at
  <http://bugs.mysql.com/> to see whether the bug has
  been reported and fixed.
- You can also use <http://www.mysql.com/search/> to
  search all the Web pages (including the manual) that are located
  at the MySQL website.

If you cannot find an answer in the manual, the bugs database, or
the mailing list archives, check with your local MySQL expert. If
you still cannot find an answer to your question, please use the
following guidelines for reporting the bug.

The normal way to report bugs is to visit
<http://bugs.mysql.com/>, which is the address for our
bugs database. This database is public and can be browsed and
searched by anyone. If you log in to the system, you can enter new
reports.

Bugs posted in the bugs database at
<http://bugs.mysql.com/> that are corrected for a given
release are noted in the release notes.

If you find a security bug in MySQL Server, please let us know
immediately by sending an email message to
`<secalert_us@oracle.com>`. Exception: Support customers
should report all problems, including security bugs, to Oracle
Support at <http://support.oracle.com/>.

To discuss problems with other users, you can use the
[MySQL Community
Slack](https://mysqlcommunity.slack.com/).

Writing a good bug report takes patience, but doing it right the
first time saves time both for us and for yourself. A good bug
report, containing a full test case for the bug, makes it very
likely that we will fix the bug in the next release. This section
helps you write your report correctly so that you do not waste your
time doing things that may not help us much or at all. Please read
this section carefully and make sure that all the information
described here is included in your report.

Preferably, you should test the problem using the latest production
or development version of MySQL Server before posting. Anyone should
be able to repeat the bug by just using `mysql test <
script_file` on your test case or by running the shell or
Perl script that you include in the bug report. Any bug that we are
able to repeat has a high chance of being fixed in the next MySQL
release.

It is most helpful when a good description of the problem is
included in the bug report. That is, give a good example of
everything you did that led to the problem and describe, in exact
detail, the problem itself. The best reports are those that include
a full example showing how to reproduce the bug or problem. See
[Section 7.9, “Debugging MySQL”](debugging-mysql.md "7.9 Debugging MySQL").

Remember that it is possible for us to respond to a report
containing too much information, but not to one containing too
little. People often omit facts because they think they know the
cause of a problem and assume that some details do not matter. A
good principle to follow is that if you are in doubt about stating
something, state it. It is faster and less troublesome to write a
couple more lines in your report than to wait longer for the answer
if we must ask you to provide information that was missing from the
initial report.

The most common errors made in bug reports are (a) not including the
version number of the MySQL distribution that you use, and (b) not
fully describing the platform on which the MySQL server is installed
(including the platform type and version number). These are highly
relevant pieces of information, and in 99 cases out of 100, the bug
report is useless without them. Very often we get questions like,
“Why doesn't this work for me?” Then we find that the
feature requested wasn't implemented in that MySQL version, or that
a bug described in a report has been fixed in newer MySQL versions.
Errors often are platform-dependent. In such cases, it is next to
impossible for us to fix anything without knowing the operating
system and the version number of the platform.

If you compiled MySQL from source, remember also to provide
information about your compiler if it is related to the problem.
Often people find bugs in compilers and think the problem is
MySQL-related. Most compilers are under development all the time and
become better version by version. To determine whether your problem
depends on your compiler, we need to know what compiler you used.
Note that every compiling problem should be regarded as a bug and
reported accordingly.

If a program produces an error message, it is very important to
include the message in your report. If we try to search for
something from the archives, it is better that the error message
reported exactly matches the one that the program produces. (Even
the lettercase should be observed.) It is best to copy and paste the
entire error message into your report. You should never try to
reproduce the message from memory.

If you have a problem with Connector/ODBC (MyODBC), please try to
generate a trace file and send it with your report. See
[How to Report Connector/ODBC Problems or Bugs](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/connector-odbc/en/connector-odbc-support-bug-report.html).

If your report includes long query output lines from test cases that
you run with the [**mysql**](mysql.md "6.5.1 mysql — The MySQL Command-Line Client") command-line tool, you can
make the output more readable by using the
[`--vertical`](mysql-command-options.md#option_mysql_vertical) option or the
`\G` statement terminator. The
[`EXPLAIN SELECT`](explain.md "15.8.2 EXPLAIN Statement")
example later in this section demonstrates the use of
`\G`.

Please include the following information in your report:

- The version number of the MySQL distribution you are using (for
  example, MySQL 5.7.10). You can find out which version you are
  running by executing [**mysqladmin version**](mysqladmin.md "6.5.2 mysqladmin — A MySQL Server Administration Program"). The
  [**mysqladmin**](mysqladmin.md "6.5.2 mysqladmin — A MySQL Server Administration Program") program can be found in the
  `bin` directory under your MySQL installation
  directory.
- The manufacturer and model of the machine on which you
  experience the problem.
- The operating system name and version. If you work with Windows,
  you can usually get the name and version number by
  double-clicking your My Computer icon and pulling down the
  “Help/About Windows” menu. For most Unix-like
  operating systems, you can get this information by executing the
  command `uname -a`.
- Sometimes the amount of memory (real and virtual) is relevant.
  If in doubt, include these values.
- The contents of the `docs/INFO_BIN` file from
  your MySQL installation. This file contains information about
  how MySQL was configured and compiled.
- If you are using a source distribution of the MySQL software,
  include the name and version number of the compiler that you
  used. If you have a binary distribution, include the
  distribution name.
- If the problem occurs during compilation, include the exact
  error messages and also a few lines of context around the
  offending code in the file where the error occurs.
- If [**mysqld**](mysqld.md "6.3.1 mysqld — The MySQL Server") died, you should also report the
  statement that caused [**mysqld**](mysqld.md "6.3.1 mysqld — The MySQL Server") to unexpectedly
  exit. You can usually get this information by running
  [**mysqld**](mysqld.md "6.3.1 mysqld — The MySQL Server") with query logging enabled, and then
  looking in the log after [**mysqld**](mysqld.md "6.3.1 mysqld — The MySQL Server") exits. See
  [Section 7.9, “Debugging MySQL”](debugging-mysql.md "7.9 Debugging MySQL").
- If a database table is related to the problem, include the
  output from the `SHOW CREATE TABLE
  db_name.tbl_name`
  statement in the bug report. This is a very easy way to get the
  definition of any table in a database. The information helps us
  create a situation matching the one that you have experienced.
- The SQL mode in effect when the problem occurred can be
  significant, so please report the value of the
  [`sql_mode`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_sql_mode) system variable. For
  stored procedure, stored function, and trigger objects, the
  relevant [`sql_mode`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_sql_mode) value is the
  one in effect when the object was created. For a stored
  procedure or function, the [`SHOW CREATE
  PROCEDURE`](show-create-procedure.md "15.7.7.9 SHOW CREATE PROCEDURE Statement") or [`SHOW CREATE
  FUNCTION`](show-create-function.md "15.7.7.8 SHOW CREATE FUNCTION Statement") statement shows the relevant SQL mode, or you
  can query `INFORMATION_SCHEMA` for the
  information:

  ```sql
  SELECT ROUTINE_SCHEMA, ROUTINE_NAME, SQL_MODE
  FROM INFORMATION_SCHEMA.ROUTINES;
  ```

  For triggers, you can use this statement:

  ```sql
  SELECT EVENT_OBJECT_SCHEMA, EVENT_OBJECT_TABLE, TRIGGER_NAME, SQL_MODE
  FROM INFORMATION_SCHEMA.TRIGGERS;
  ```
- For performance-related bugs or problems with
  [`SELECT`](select.md "15.2.13 SELECT Statement") statements, you should
  always include the output of `EXPLAIN SELECT
  ...`, and at least the number of rows that the
  [`SELECT`](select.md "15.2.13 SELECT Statement") statement produces. You
  should also include the output from `SHOW CREATE TABLE
  tbl_name` for each table
  that is involved. The more information you provide about your
  situation, the more likely it is that someone can help you.

  The following is an example of a very good bug report. The
  statements are run using the [**mysql**](mysql.md "6.5.1 mysql — The MySQL Command-Line Client")
  command-line tool. Note the use of the `\G`
  statement terminator for statements that would otherwise provide
  very long output lines that are difficult to read.

  ```sql
  mysql> SHOW VARIABLES;
  mysql> SHOW COLUMNS FROM ...\G
         <output from SHOW COLUMNS>
  mysql> EXPLAIN SELECT ...\G
         <output from EXPLAIN>
  mysql> FLUSH STATUS;
  mysql> SELECT ...;
         <A short version of the output from SELECT,
         including the time taken to run the query>
  mysql> SHOW STATUS;
         <output from SHOW STATUS>
  ```
- If a bug or problem occurs while running
  [**mysqld**](mysqld.md "6.3.1 mysqld — The MySQL Server"), try to provide an input script that
  reproduces the anomaly. This script should include any necessary
  source files. The more closely the script can reproduce your
  situation, the better. If you can make a reproducible test case,
  you should upload it to be attached to the bug report.

  If you cannot provide a script, you should at least include the
  output from [**mysqladmin variables extended-status
  processlist**](mysqladmin.md "6.5.2 mysqladmin — A MySQL Server Administration Program") in your report to provide some information
  on how your system is performing.
- If you cannot produce a test case with only a few rows, or if
  the test table is too big to be included in the bug report (more
  than 10 rows), you should dump your tables using
  [**mysqldump**](mysqldump.md "6.5.4 mysqldump — A Database Backup Program") and create a
  `README` file that describes your problem.
  Create a compressed archive of your files using
  **tar** and **gzip** or
  **zip**. After you initiate a bug report for our
  bugs database at <http://bugs.mysql.com/>, click
  the Files tab in the bug report for instructions on uploading
  the archive to the bugs database.
- If you believe that the MySQL server produces a strange result
  from a statement, include not only the result, but also your
  opinion of what the result should be, and an explanation
  describing the basis for your opinion.
- When you provide an example of the problem, it is better to use
  the table names, variable names, and so forth that exist in your
  actual situation than to come up with new names. The problem
  could be related to the name of a table or variable. These cases
  are rare, perhaps, but it is better to be safe than sorry. After
  all, it should be easier for you to provide an example that uses
  your actual situation, and it is by all means better for us. If
  you have data that you do not want to be visible to others in
  the bug report, you can upload it using the Files tab as
  previously described. If the information is really top secret
  and you do not want to show it even to us, go ahead and provide
  an example using other names, but please regard this as the last
  choice.
- Include all the options given to the relevant programs, if
  possible. For example, indicate the options that you use when
  you start the [**mysqld**](mysqld.md "6.3.1 mysqld — The MySQL Server") server, as well as the
  options that you use to run any MySQL client programs. The
  options to programs such as [**mysqld**](mysqld.md "6.3.1 mysqld — The MySQL Server") and
  [**mysql**](mysql.md "6.5.1 mysql — The MySQL Command-Line Client"), and to the
  **configure** script, are often key to resolving
  problems and are very relevant. It is never a bad idea to
  include them. If your problem involves a program written in a
  language such as Perl or PHP, please include the language
  processor's version number, as well as the version for any
  modules that the program uses. For example, if you have a Perl
  script that uses the `DBI` and
  `DBD::mysql` modules, include the version
  numbers for Perl, `DBI`, and
  `DBD::mysql`.
- If your question is related to the privilege system, please
  include the output of [**mysqladmin reload**](mysqladmin.md "6.5.2 mysqladmin — A MySQL Server Administration Program"), and
  all the error messages you get when trying to connect. When you
  test your privileges, you should execute [**mysqladmin
  reload version**](mysqladmin.md "6.5.2 mysqladmin — A MySQL Server Administration Program") and try to connect with the program
  that gives you trouble.
- If you have a patch for a bug, do include it. But do not assume
  that the patch is all we need, or that we can use it, if you do
  not provide some necessary information such as test cases
  showing the bug that your patch fixes. We might find problems
  with your patch or we might not understand it at all. If so, we
  cannot use it.

  If we cannot verify the exact purpose of the patch, we will not
  use it. Test cases help us here. Show that the patch handles all
  the situations that may occur. If we find a borderline case
  (even a rare one) where the patch will not work, it may be
  useless.
- Guesses about what the bug is, why it occurs, or what it depends
  on are usually wrong. Even the MySQL team cannot guess such
  things without first using a debugger to determine the real
  cause of a bug.
- Indicate in your bug report that you have checked the reference
  manual and mail archive so that others know you have tried to
  solve the problem yourself.
- If your data appears corrupt or you get errors when you access a
  particular table, first check your tables with
  [`CHECK TABLE`](check-table.md "15.7.3.2 CHECK TABLE Statement"). If that statement
  reports any errors:

  - The `InnoDB` crash recovery mechanism
    handles cleanup when the server is restarted after being
    killed, so in typical operation there is no need to
    “repair” tables. If you encounter an error with
    `InnoDB` tables, restart the server and see
    whether the problem persists, or whether the error affected
    only cached data in memory. If data is corrupted on disk,
    consider restarting with the
    [`innodb_force_recovery`](innodb-parameters.md#sysvar_innodb_force_recovery)
    option enabled so that you can dump the affected tables.
  - For non-transactional tables, try to repair them with
    [`REPAIR TABLE`](repair-table.md "15.7.3.5 REPAIR TABLE Statement") or with
    [**myisamchk**](myisamchk.md "6.6.4 myisamchk — MyISAM Table-Maintenance Utility"). See
    [Chapter 7, *MySQL Server Administration*](server-administration.md "Chapter 7 MySQL Server Administration").

  If you are running Windows, please verify the value of
  [`lower_case_table_names`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_lower_case_table_names) using
  the `SHOW VARIABLES LIKE
  'lower_case_table_names'` statement. This variable
  affects how the server handles lettercase of database and table
  names. Its effect for a given value should be as described in
  [Section 11.2.3, “Identifier Case Sensitivity”](identifier-case-sensitivity.md "11.2.3 Identifier Case Sensitivity").
- If you often get corrupted tables, you should try to find out
  when and why this happens. In this case, the error log in the
  MySQL data directory may contain some information about what
  happened. (This is the file with the `.err`
  suffix in the name.) See [Section 7.4.2, “The Error Log”](error-log.md "7.4.2 The Error Log"). Please
  include any relevant information from this file in your bug
  report. Normally [**mysqld**](mysqld.md "6.3.1 mysqld — The MySQL Server") should
  *never* corrupt a table if nothing killed it
  in the middle of an update. If you can find the cause of
  [**mysqld**](mysqld.md "6.3.1 mysqld — The MySQL Server") dying, it is much easier for us to
  provide you with a fix for the problem. See
  [Section B.3.1, “How to Determine What Is Causing a Problem”](what-is-crashing.md "B.3.1 How to Determine What Is Causing a Problem").
- If possible, download and install the most recent version of
  MySQL Server and check whether it solves your problem. All
  versions of the MySQL software are thoroughly tested and should
  work without problems. We believe in making everything as
  backward-compatible as possible, and you should be able to
  switch MySQL versions without difficulty. See
  [Section 2.1.2, “Which MySQL Version and Distribution to Install”](which-version.md "2.1.2 Which MySQL Version and Distribution to Install").
