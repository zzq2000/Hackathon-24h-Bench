Note

This section describes locking information as exposed by the
Performance Schema [`data_locks`](performance-schema-data-locks-table.md "29.12.13.1 The data_locks Table") and
[`data_lock_waits`](performance-schema-data-lock-waits-table.md "29.12.13.2 The data_lock_waits Table") tables, which
supersede the `INFORMATION_SCHEMA`
`INNODB_LOCKS` and
`INNODB_LOCK_WAITS` tables in MySQL
8.0. For similar discussion written in terms of the
older `INFORMATION_SCHEMA` tables, see
[InnoDB INFORMATION\_SCHEMA Transaction and Locking Information](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/innodb-information-schema-transactions.html),
in [MySQL 5.7 Reference Manual](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/).

One `INFORMATION_SCHEMA` table and two
Performance Schema tables enable you to monitor
`InnoDB` transactions and diagnose potential
locking problems:

- [`INNODB_TRX`](information-schema-innodb-trx-table.md "28.4.28 The INFORMATION_SCHEMA INNODB_TRX Table"): This
  `INFORMATION_SCHEMA` table provides
  information about every transaction currently executing inside
  `InnoDB`, including the transaction state
  (for example, whether it is running or waiting for a lock),
  when the transaction started, and the particular SQL statement
  the transaction is executing.
- [`data_locks`](performance-schema-data-locks-table.md "29.12.13.1 The data_locks Table"): This Performance
  Schema table contains a row for each hold lock and each lock
  request that is blocked waiting for a held lock to be
  released:

  - There is one row for each held lock, whatever the state of
    the transaction that holds the lock
    (`INNODB_TRX.TRX_STATE` is
    `RUNNING`, `LOCK WAIT`,
    `ROLLING BACK` or
    `COMMITTING`).
  - Each transaction in InnoDB that is waiting for another
    transaction to release a lock
    (`INNODB_TRX.TRX_STATE` is `LOCK
    WAIT`) is blocked by exactly one blocking lock
    request. That blocking lock request is for a row or table
    lock held by another transaction in an incompatible mode.
    A lock request always has a mode that is incompatible with
    the mode of the held lock that blocks the request (read
    vs. write, shared vs. exclusive).

    The blocked transaction cannot proceed until the other
    transaction commits or rolls back, thereby releasing the
    requested lock. For every blocked transaction,
    [`data_locks`](performance-schema-data-locks-table.md "29.12.13.1 The data_locks Table") contains one row
    that describes each lock the transaction has requested,
    and for which it is waiting.
- [`data_lock_waits`](performance-schema-data-lock-waits-table.md "29.12.13.2 The data_lock_waits Table"): This Performance
  Schema table indicates which transactions are waiting for a
  given lock, or for which lock a given transaction is waiting.
  This table contains one or more rows for each blocked
  transaction, indicating the lock it has requested and any
  locks that are blocking that request. The
  `REQUESTING_ENGINE_LOCK_ID` value refers to
  the lock requested by a transaction, and the
  `BLOCKING_ENGINE_LOCK_ID` value refers to the
  lock (held by another transaction) that prevents the first
  transaction from proceeding. For any given blocked
  transaction, all rows in
  [`data_lock_waits`](performance-schema-data-lock-waits-table.md "29.12.13.2 The data_lock_waits Table") have the same
  value for `REQUESTING_ENGINE_LOCK_ID` and
  different values for
  `BLOCKING_ENGINE_LOCK_ID`.
