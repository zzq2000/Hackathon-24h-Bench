#### 15.1.20.4 CREATE TABLE ... SELECT Statement

You can create one table from another by adding a
[`SELECT`](select.md "15.2.13 SELECT Statement") statement at the end of
the [`CREATE TABLE`](create-table.md "15.1.20 CREATE TABLE Statement") statement:

```sql
CREATE TABLE new_tbl [AS] SELECT * FROM orig_tbl;
```

MySQL creates new columns for all elements in the
[`SELECT`](select.md "15.2.13 SELECT Statement"). For example:

```sql
mysql> CREATE TABLE test (a INT NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT,
    ->        PRIMARY KEY (a), KEY(b))
    ->        ENGINE=InnoDB SELECT b,c FROM test2;
```

This creates an [`InnoDB`](innodb-storage-engine.md "Chapter 17 The InnoDB Storage Engine") table with
three columns, `a`, `b`, and
`c`. The `ENGINE` option is
part of the [`CREATE TABLE`](create-table.md "15.1.20 CREATE TABLE Statement")
statement, and should not be used following the
[`SELECT`](select.md "15.2.13 SELECT Statement"); this would result in a
syntax error. The same is true for other
[`CREATE TABLE`](create-table.md "15.1.20 CREATE TABLE Statement") options such as
`CHARSET`.

Notice that the columns from the
[`SELECT`](select.md "15.2.13 SELECT Statement") statement are appended to
the right side of the table, not overlapped onto it. Take the
following example:

```sql
mysql> SELECT * FROM foo;
+---+
| n |
+---+
| 1 |
+---+

mysql> CREATE TABLE bar (m INT) SELECT n FROM foo;
Query OK, 1 row affected (0.02 sec)
Records: 1  Duplicates: 0  Warnings: 0

mysql> SELECT * FROM bar;
+------+---+
| m    | n |
+------+---+
| NULL | 1 |
+------+---+
1 row in set (0.00 sec)
```

For each row in table `foo`, a row is inserted
in `bar` with the values from
`foo` and default values for the new columns.

In a table resulting from
[`CREATE TABLE ...
SELECT`](create-table.md "15.1.20 CREATE TABLE Statement"), columns named only in the
[`CREATE TABLE`](create-table.md "15.1.20 CREATE TABLE Statement") part come first.
Columns named in both parts or only in the
[`SELECT`](select.md "15.2.13 SELECT Statement") part come after that. The
data type of [`SELECT`](select.md "15.2.13 SELECT Statement") columns can
be overridden by also specifying the column in the
[`CREATE TABLE`](create-table.md "15.1.20 CREATE TABLE Statement") part.

If errors occur while copying data to the table, the table is
automatically dropped and not created. However, prior to MySQL
8.0.21, when row-based replication is in use, a
[`CREATE
TABLE ... SELECT`](create-table-select.md "15.1.20.4 CREATE TABLE ... SELECT Statement") statement is recorded in the binary
log as two transactions, one to create the table, and the other
to insert data. When the statement applied from the binary log,
a failure between the two transactions or while copying data can
result in replication of an empty table. That limitation is
removed in MySQL 8.0.21. On storage engines that support atomic
DDL, [`CREATE
TABLE ... SELECT`](create-table-select.md "15.1.20.4 CREATE TABLE ... SELECT Statement") is now recorded and applied as one
transaction when row-based replication is in use. For more
information, see [Section 15.1.1, “Atomic Data Definition Statement Support”](atomic-ddl.md "15.1.1 Atomic Data Definition Statement Support").

As of MySQL 8.0.21, on storage engines that support both atomic
DDL and foreign key constraints, creation of foreign keys is not
permitted in
[`CREATE
TABLE ... SELECT`](create-table-select.md "15.1.20.4 CREATE TABLE ... SELECT Statement") statements when row-based replication
is in use. Foreign key constraints can be added later using
[`ALTER TABLE`](alter-table.md "15.1.9 ALTER TABLE Statement").

You can precede the [`SELECT`](select.md "15.2.13 SELECT Statement") by
`IGNORE` or `REPLACE` to
indicate how to handle rows that duplicate unique key values.
With `IGNORE`, rows that duplicate an existing
row on a unique key value are discarded. With
`REPLACE`, new rows replace rows that have the
same unique key value. If neither `IGNORE` nor
`REPLACE` is specified, duplicate unique key
values result in an error. For more information, see
[The Effect of IGNORE on Statement Execution](sql-mode.md#ignore-effect-on-execution "The Effect of IGNORE on Statement Execution").

In MySQL 8.0.19 and later, you can also use a
[`VALUES`](values.md "15.2.19 VALUES Statement") statement in the
[`SELECT`](select.md "15.2.13 SELECT Statement") part of `CREATE
TABLE ... SELECT`; the `VALUES`
portion of the statement must include a table alias using an
`AS` clause. To name the columns coming from
`VALUES`, supply column aliases with the table
alias; otherwise, the default column names
`column_0`, `column_1`,
`column_2`, ..., are used.

Otherwise, naming of columns in the table thus created follows
the same rules as described previously in this section.
Examples:

```sql
mysql> CREATE TABLE tv1
     >     SELECT * FROM (VALUES ROW(1,3,5), ROW(2,4,6)) AS v;
mysql> TABLE tv1;
+----------+----------+----------+
| column_0 | column_1 | column_2 |
+----------+----------+----------+
|        1 |        3 |        5 |
|        2 |        4 |        6 |
+----------+----------+----------+

mysql> CREATE TABLE tv2
     >     SELECT * FROM (VALUES ROW(1,3,5), ROW(2,4,6)) AS v(x,y,z);
mysql> TABLE tv2;
+---+---+---+
| x | y | z |
+---+---+---+
| 1 | 3 | 5 |
| 2 | 4 | 6 |
+---+---+---+

mysql> CREATE TABLE tv3 (a INT, b INT, c INT)
     >     SELECT * FROM (VALUES ROW(1,3,5), ROW(2,4,6)) AS v(x,y,z);
mysql> TABLE tv3;
+------+------+------+----------+----------+----------+
| a    | b    | c    |        x |        y |        z |
+------+------+------+----------+----------+----------+
| NULL | NULL | NULL |        1 |        3 |        5 |
| NULL | NULL | NULL |        2 |        4 |        6 |
+------+------+------+----------+----------+----------+

mysql> CREATE TABLE tv4 (a INT, b INT, c INT)
     >     SELECT * FROM (VALUES ROW(1,3,5), ROW(2,4,6)) AS v(x,y,z);
mysql> TABLE tv4;
+------+------+------+---+---+---+
| a    | b    | c    | x | y | z |
+------+------+------+---+---+---+
| NULL | NULL | NULL | 1 | 3 | 5 |
| NULL | NULL | NULL | 2 | 4 | 6 |
+------+------+------+---+---+---+

mysql> CREATE TABLE tv5 (a INT, b INT, c INT)
     >     SELECT * FROM (VALUES ROW(1,3,5), ROW(2,4,6)) AS v(a,b,c);
mysql> TABLE tv5;
+------+------+------+
| a    | b    | c    |
+------+------+------+
|    1 |    3 |    5 |
|    2 |    4 |    6 |
+------+------+------+
```

When selecting all columns and using the default column names,
you can omit `SELECT *`, so the statement just
used to create table `tv1` can also be written
as shown here:

```sql
mysql> CREATE TABLE tv1 VALUES ROW(1,3,5), ROW(2,4,6);
mysql> TABLE tv1;
+----------+----------+----------+
| column_0 | column_1 | column_2 |
+----------+----------+----------+
|        1 |        3 |        5 |
|        2 |        4 |        6 |
+----------+----------+----------+
```

When using [`VALUES`](values.md "15.2.19 VALUES Statement") as the source
of the [`SELECT`](select.md "15.2.13 SELECT Statement"), all columns are
always selected into the new table, and individual columns
cannot be selected as they can be when selecting from a named
table; each of the following statements produces an error
([`ER_OPERAND_COLUMNS`](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/mysql-errors/8.0/en/server-error-reference.html#error_er_operand_columns)):

```sql
CREATE TABLE tvx
    SELECT (x,z) FROM (VALUES ROW(1,3,5), ROW(2,4,6)) AS v(x,y,z);

CREATE TABLE tvx (a INT, c INT)
    SELECT (x,z) FROM (VALUES ROW(1,3,5), ROW(2,4,6)) AS v(x,y,z);
```

Similarly, you can use a [`TABLE`](table.md "15.2.16 TABLE Statement")
statement in place of the [`SELECT`](select.md "15.2.13 SELECT Statement").
This follows the same rules as with
[`VALUES`](values.md "15.2.19 VALUES Statement"); all columns of the source
table and their names in the source table are always inserted
into the new table. Examples:

```sql
mysql> TABLE t1;
+----+----+
| a  | b  |
+----+----+
|  1 |  2 |
|  6 |  7 |
| 10 | -4 |
| 14 |  6 |
+----+----+

mysql> CREATE TABLE tt1 TABLE t1;
mysql> TABLE tt1;
+----+----+
| a  | b  |
+----+----+
|  1 |  2 |
|  6 |  7 |
| 10 | -4 |
| 14 |  6 |
+----+----+

mysql> CREATE TABLE tt2 (x INT) TABLE t1;
mysql> TABLE tt2;
+------+----+----+
| x    | a  | b  |
+------+----+----+
| NULL |  1 |  2 |
| NULL |  6 |  7 |
| NULL | 10 | -4 |
| NULL | 14 |  6 |
+------+----+----+
```

Because the ordering of the rows in the underlying
[`SELECT`](select.md "15.2.13 SELECT Statement") statements cannot always
be determined, `CREATE TABLE ... IGNORE SELECT`
and `CREATE TABLE ... REPLACE SELECT`
statements are flagged as unsafe for statement-based
replication. Such statements produce a warning in the error log
when using statement-based mode and are written to the binary
log using the row-based format when using
`MIXED` mode. See also
[Section 19.2.1.1, “Advantages and Disadvantages of Statement-Based and Row-Based
Replication”](replication-sbr-rbr.md "19.2.1.1 Advantages and Disadvantages of Statement-Based and Row-Based Replication").

[`CREATE TABLE ...
SELECT`](create-table.md "15.1.20 CREATE TABLE Statement") does not automatically create any indexes for
you. This is done intentionally to make the statement as
flexible as possible. If you want to have indexes in the created
table, you should specify these before the
[`SELECT`](select.md "15.2.13 SELECT Statement") statement:

```sql
mysql> CREATE TABLE bar (UNIQUE (n)) SELECT n FROM foo;
```

For `CREATE TABLE ... SELECT`, the destination
table does not preserve information about whether columns in the
selected-from table are generated columns. The
[`SELECT`](select.md "15.2.13 SELECT Statement") part of the statement
cannot assign values to generated columns in the destination
table.

For `CREATE TABLE ... SELECT`, the destination
table does preserve expression default values from the original
table.

Some conversion of data types might occur. For example, the
`AUTO_INCREMENT` attribute is not preserved,
and [`VARCHAR`](char.md "13.3.2 The CHAR and VARCHAR Types") columns can become
[`CHAR`](char.md "13.3.2 The CHAR and VARCHAR Types") columns. Retrained
attributes are `NULL` (or `NOT
NULL`) and, for those columns that have them,
`CHARACTER SET`, `COLLATION`,
`COMMENT`, and the `DEFAULT`
clause.

When creating a table with
[`CREATE
TABLE ... SELECT`](create-table-select.md "15.1.20.4 CREATE TABLE ... SELECT Statement"), make sure to alias any function
calls or expressions in the query. If you do not, the
`CREATE` statement might fail or result in
undesirable column names.

```sql
CREATE TABLE artists_and_works
  SELECT artist.name, COUNT(work.artist_id) AS number_of_works
  FROM artist LEFT JOIN work ON artist.id = work.artist_id
  GROUP BY artist.id;
```

You can also explicitly specify the data type for a column in
the created table:

```sql
CREATE TABLE foo (a TINYINT NOT NULL) SELECT b+1 AS a FROM bar;
```

For [`CREATE TABLE
... SELECT`](create-table.md "15.1.20 CREATE TABLE Statement"), if `IF NOT EXISTS` is
given and the target table exists, nothing is inserted into the
destination table, and the statement is not logged.

To ensure that the binary log can be used to re-create the
original tables, MySQL does not permit concurrent inserts during
[`CREATE TABLE ...
SELECT`](create-table.md "15.1.20 CREATE TABLE Statement"). However, prior to MySQL 8.0.21, when a
[`CREATE TABLE ...
SELECT`](create-table.md "15.1.20 CREATE TABLE Statement") operation is applied from the binary log when
row-based replication is in use, concurrent inserts are
permitted on the replicated table while copying data. That
limitation is removed in MySQL 8.0.21 on storage engines that
support atomic DDL. For more information, see
[Section 15.1.1, “Atomic Data Definition Statement Support”](atomic-ddl.md "15.1.1 Atomic Data Definition Statement Support").

You cannot use `FOR UPDATE` as part of the
[`SELECT`](select.md "15.2.13 SELECT Statement") in a statement such as
[`CREATE
TABLE new_table SELECT ... FROM
old_table ...`](create-table-select.md "15.1.20.4 CREATE TABLE ... SELECT Statement"). If you
attempt to do so, the statement fails.

[`CREATE
TABLE ... SELECT`](create-table-select.md "15.1.20.4 CREATE TABLE ... SELECT Statement") operations apply
`ENGINE_ATTRIBUTE` and
`SECONDARY_ENGINE_ATTRIBUTE` values to columns
only. Table and index `ENGINE_ATTRIBUTE` and
`SECONDARY_ENGINE_ATTRIBUTE` values are not
applied to the new table unless specified explicitly.
