### 12.3.1 Collation Naming Conventions

MySQL collation names follow these conventions:

- A collation name starts with the name of the character set
  with which it is associated, generally followed by one or
  more suffixes indicating other collation characteristics.
  For example, `utf8mb4_0900_ai_ci` and
  `latin1_swedish_ci` are collations for the
  `utf8mb4` and `latin1`
  character sets, respectively. The `binary`
  character set has a single collation, also named
  `binary`, with no suffixes.
- A language-specific collation includes a locale code or
  language name. For example,
  `utf8mb4_tr_0900_ai_ci` and
  `utf8mb4_hu_0900_ai_ci` sort characters for
  the `utf8mb4` character set using the rules
  of Turkish and Hungarian, respectively.
  `utf8mb4_turkish_ci` and
  `utf8mb4_hungarian_ci` are similar but
  based on a less recent version of the Unicode Collation
  Algorithm.
- Collation suffixes indicate whether a collation is
  case-sensitive, accent-sensitive, or kana-sensitive (or some
  combination thereof), or binary. The following table shows
  the suffixes used to indicate these characteristics.

  **Table 12.1 Collation Suffix Meanings**

  | Suffix | Meaning |
  | --- | --- |
  | `_ai` | Accent-insensitive |
  | `_as` | Accent-sensitive |
  | `_ci` | Case-insensitive |
  | `_cs` | Case-sensitive |
  | `_ks` | Kana-sensitive |
  | `_bin` | Binary |

  For nonbinary collation names that do not specify accent
  sensitivity, it is determined by case sensitivity. If a
  collation name does not contain `_ai` or
  `_as`, `_ci` in the name
  implies `_ai` and `_cs` in
  the name implies `_as`. For example,
  `latin1_general_ci` is explicitly
  case-insensitive and implicitly accent-insensitive,
  `latin1_general_cs` is explicitly
  case-sensitive and implicitly accent-sensitive, and
  `utf8mb4_0900_ai_ci` is explicitly
  case-insensitive and accent-insensitive.

  For Japanese collations, the `_ks` suffix
  indicates that a collation is kana-sensitive; that is, it
  distinguishes Katakana characters from Hiragana characters.
  Japanese collations without the `_ks`
  suffix are not kana-sensitive and treat Katakana and
  Hiragana characters equal for sorting.

  For the `binary` collation of the
  `binary` character set, comparisons are
  based on numeric byte values. For the
  `_bin` collation of a nonbinary character
  set, comparisons are based on numeric character code values,
  which differ from byte values for multibyte characters. For
  information about the differences between the
  `binary` collation of the
  `binary` character set and the
  `_bin` collations of nonbinary character
  sets, see [Section 12.8.5, “The binary Collation Compared to \_bin Collations”](charset-binary-collations.md "12.8.5 The binary Collation Compared to _bin Collations").
- Collation names for Unicode character sets may include a
  version number to indicate the version of the Unicode
  Collation Algorithm (UCA) on which the collation is based.
  UCA-based collations without a version number in the name
  use the version-4.0.0 UCA weight keys. For example:

  - `utf8mb4_0900_ai_ci` is based on UCA
    9.0.0 weight keys
    (<http://www.unicode.org/Public/UCA/9.0.0/allkeys.txt>).
  - `utf8mb4_unicode_520_ci` is based on
    UCA 5.2.0 weight keys
    (<http://www.unicode.org/Public/UCA/5.2.0/allkeys.txt>).
  - `utf8mb4_unicode_ci` (with no version
    named) is based on UCA 4.0.0 weight keys
    (<http://www.unicode.org/Public/UCA/4.0.0/allkeys-4.0.0.txt>).
- For Unicode character sets, the
  `xxx_general_mysql500_ci`
  collations preserve the pre-5.1.24 ordering of the original
  `xxx_general_ci`
  collations and permit upgrades for tables created before
  MySQL 5.1.24 (Bug #27877).
