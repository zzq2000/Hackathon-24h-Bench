### 7.6.2 Obtaining Server Plugin Information

There are several ways to determine which plugins are installed in
the server:

- The Information Schema [`PLUGINS`](information-schema-plugins-table.md "28.3.22 The INFORMATION_SCHEMA PLUGINS Table")
  table contains a row for each loaded plugin. Any that have a
  `PLUGIN_LIBRARY` value of
  `NULL` are built in and cannot be unloaded.

  ```sql
  mysql> SELECT * FROM INFORMATION_SCHEMA.PLUGINS\G
  *************************** 1. row ***************************
             PLUGIN_NAME: binlog
          PLUGIN_VERSION: 1.0
           PLUGIN_STATUS: ACTIVE
             PLUGIN_TYPE: STORAGE ENGINE
     PLUGIN_TYPE_VERSION: 50158.0
          PLUGIN_LIBRARY: NULL
  PLUGIN_LIBRARY_VERSION: NULL
           PLUGIN_AUTHOR: Oracle Corporation
      PLUGIN_DESCRIPTION: This is a pseudo storage engine to represent the binlog in a transaction
          PLUGIN_LICENSE: GPL
             LOAD_OPTION: FORCE
  ...
  *************************** 10. row ***************************
             PLUGIN_NAME: InnoDB
          PLUGIN_VERSION: 1.0
           PLUGIN_STATUS: ACTIVE
             PLUGIN_TYPE: STORAGE ENGINE
     PLUGIN_TYPE_VERSION: 50158.0
          PLUGIN_LIBRARY: ha_innodb_plugin.so
  PLUGIN_LIBRARY_VERSION: 1.0
           PLUGIN_AUTHOR: Oracle Corporation
      PLUGIN_DESCRIPTION: Supports transactions, row-level locking,
                          and foreign keys
          PLUGIN_LICENSE: GPL
             LOAD_OPTION: ON
  ...
  ```
- The [`SHOW PLUGINS`](show-plugins.md "15.7.7.25 SHOW PLUGINS Statement") statement
  displays a row for each loaded plugin. Any that have a
  `Library` value of `NULL`
  are built in and cannot be unloaded.

  ```sql
  mysql> SHOW PLUGINS\G
  *************************** 1. row ***************************
     Name: binlog
   Status: ACTIVE
     Type: STORAGE ENGINE
  Library: NULL
  License: GPL
  ...
  *************************** 10. row ***************************
     Name: InnoDB
   Status: ACTIVE
     Type: STORAGE ENGINE
  Library: ha_innodb_plugin.so
  License: GPL
  ...
  ```
- The `mysql.plugin` table shows which plugins
  have been registered with [`INSTALL
  PLUGIN`](install-plugin.md "15.7.4.4 INSTALL PLUGIN Statement"). The table contains only plugin names and
  library file names, so it does not provide as much information
  as the [`PLUGINS`](information-schema-plugins-table.md "28.3.22 The INFORMATION_SCHEMA PLUGINS Table") table or the
  [`SHOW PLUGINS`](show-plugins.md "15.7.7.25 SHOW PLUGINS Statement") statement.
