### 10.3.4 Foreign Key Optimization

If a table has many columns, and you query many different
combinations of columns, it might be efficient to split the
less-frequently used data into separate tables with a few
columns each, and relate them back to the main table by
duplicating the numeric ID column from the main table. That way,
each small table can have a primary key for fast lookups of its
data, and you can query just the set of columns that you need
using a join operation. Depending on how the data is
distributed, the queries might perform less I/O and take up less
cache memory because the relevant columns are packed together on
disk. (To maximize performance, queries try to read as few data
blocks as possible from disk; tables with only a few columns can
fit more rows in each data block.)
