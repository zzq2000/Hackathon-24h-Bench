#### 29.12.20.1 Wait Event Summary Tables

The Performance Schema maintains tables for collecting current
and recent wait events, and aggregates that information in
summary tables.
[Section 29.12.4, “Performance Schema Wait Event Tables”](performance-schema-wait-tables.md "29.12.4 Performance Schema Wait Event Tables") describes the
events on which wait summaries are based. See that discussion
for information about the content of wait events, the current
and recent wait event tables, and how to control wait event
collection, which is disabled by default.

Example wait event summary information:

```sql
mysql> SELECT *
       FROM performance_schema.events_waits_summary_global_by_event_name\G
...
*************************** 6. row ***************************
    EVENT_NAME: wait/synch/mutex/sql/BINARY_LOG::LOCK_index
    COUNT_STAR: 8
SUM_TIMER_WAIT: 2119302
MIN_TIMER_WAIT: 196092
AVG_TIMER_WAIT: 264912
MAX_TIMER_WAIT: 569421
...
*************************** 9. row ***************************
    EVENT_NAME: wait/synch/mutex/sql/hash_filo::lock
    COUNT_STAR: 69
SUM_TIMER_WAIT: 16848828
MIN_TIMER_WAIT: 0
AVG_TIMER_WAIT: 244185
MAX_TIMER_WAIT: 735345
...
```

Each wait event summary table has one or more grouping columns
to indicate how the table aggregates events. Event names refer
to names of event instruments in the
[`setup_instruments`](performance-schema-setup-instruments-table.md "29.12.2.3 The setup_instruments Table") table:

- [`events_waits_summary_by_account_by_event_name`](performance-schema-stage-summary-tables.md "29.12.20.2 Stage Summary Tables")
  has `EVENT_NAME`,
  `USER`, and `HOST`
  columns. Each row summarizes events for a given account
  (user and host combination) and event name.
- [`events_waits_summary_by_host_by_event_name`](performance-schema-stage-summary-tables.md "29.12.20.2 Stage Summary Tables")
  has `EVENT_NAME` and
  `HOST` columns. Each row summarizes
  events for a given host and event name.
- [`events_waits_summary_by_instance`](performance-schema-wait-summary-tables.md "29.12.20.1 Wait Event Summary Tables")
  has `EVENT_NAME` and
  `OBJECT_INSTANCE_BEGIN` columns. Each row
  summarizes events for a given event name and object. If an
  instrument is used to create multiple instances, each
  instance has a unique
  `OBJECT_INSTANCE_BEGIN` value and is
  summarized separately in this table.
- [`events_waits_summary_by_thread_by_event_name`](performance-schema-wait-summary-tables.md "29.12.20.1 Wait Event Summary Tables")
  has `THREAD_ID` and
  `EVENT_NAME` columns. Each row summarizes
  events for a given thread and event name.
- [`events_waits_summary_by_user_by_event_name`](performance-schema-stage-summary-tables.md "29.12.20.2 Stage Summary Tables")
  has `EVENT_NAME` and
  `USER` columns. Each row summarizes
  events for a given user and event name.
- [`events_waits_summary_global_by_event_name`](performance-schema-wait-summary-tables.md "29.12.20.1 Wait Event Summary Tables")
  has an `EVENT_NAME` column. Each row
  summarizes events for a given event name. An instrument
  might be used to create multiple instances of the
  instrumented object. For example, if there is an
  instrument for a mutex that is created for each
  connection, there are as many instances as there are
  connections. The summary row for the instrument summarizes
  over all these instances.

Each wait event summary table has these summary columns
containing aggregated values:

- `COUNT_STAR`

  The number of summarized events. This value includes all
  events, whether timed or nontimed.
- `SUM_TIMER_WAIT`

  The total wait time of the summarized timed events. This
  value is calculated only for timed events because nontimed
  events have a wait time of `NULL`. The
  same is true for the other
  `xxx_TIMER_WAIT`
  values.
- `MIN_TIMER_WAIT`

  The minimum wait time of the summarized timed events.
- `AVG_TIMER_WAIT`

  The average wait time of the summarized timed events.
- `MAX_TIMER_WAIT`

  The maximum wait time of the summarized timed events.

The wait event summary tables have these indexes:

- [`events_waits_summary_by_account_by_event_name`](performance-schema-stage-summary-tables.md "29.12.20.2 Stage Summary Tables"):

  - Primary key on (`USER`,
    `HOST`,
    `EVENT_NAME`)
- [`events_waits_summary_by_host_by_event_name`](performance-schema-stage-summary-tables.md "29.12.20.2 Stage Summary Tables"):

  - Primary key on (`HOST`,
    `EVENT_NAME`)
- [`events_waits_summary_by_instance`](performance-schema-wait-summary-tables.md "29.12.20.1 Wait Event Summary Tables"):

  - Primary key on
    (`OBJECT_INSTANCE_BEGIN`)
  - Index on (`EVENT_NAME`)
- [`events_waits_summary_by_thread_by_event_name`](performance-schema-wait-summary-tables.md "29.12.20.1 Wait Event Summary Tables"):

  - Primary key on (`THREAD_ID`,
    `EVENT_NAME`)
- [`events_waits_summary_by_user_by_event_name`](performance-schema-stage-summary-tables.md "29.12.20.2 Stage Summary Tables"):

  - Primary key on (`USER`,
    `EVENT_NAME`)
- [`events_waits_summary_global_by_event_name`](performance-schema-wait-summary-tables.md "29.12.20.1 Wait Event Summary Tables"):

  - Primary key on (`EVENT_NAME`)

[`TRUNCATE TABLE`](truncate-table.md "15.1.37 TRUNCATE TABLE Statement") is permitted for
wait summary tables. It has these effects:

- For summary tables not aggregated by account, host, or
  user, truncation resets the summary columns to zero rather
  than removing rows.
- For summary tables aggregated by account, host, or user,
  truncation removes rows for accounts, hosts, or users with
  no connections, and resets the summary columns to zero for
  the remaining rows.

In addition, each wait summary table that is aggregated by
account, host, user, or thread is implicitly truncated by
truncation of the connection table on which it depends, or
truncation of
[`events_waits_summary_global_by_event_name`](performance-schema-wait-summary-tables.md "29.12.20.1 Wait Event Summary Tables").
