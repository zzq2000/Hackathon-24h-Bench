### 8.1.7 Client Programming Security Guidelines

Client applications that access MySQL should use the following
guidelines to avoid interpreting external data incorrectly or
exposing sensitive information.

#### Handle External Data Properly

Applications that access MySQL should not trust any data entered
by users, who can try to trick your code by entering special or
escaped character sequences in Web forms, URLs, or whatever
application you have built. Be sure that your application
remains secure if a user tries to perform SQL injection by
entering something like `; DROP DATABASE
mysql;` into a form. This is an extreme example, but
large security leaks and data loss might occur as a result of
hackers using similar techniques, if you do not prepare for
them.

A common mistake is to protect only string data values. Remember
to check numeric data as well. If an application generates a
query such as `SELECT * FROM table WHERE
ID=234` when a user enters the value
`234`, the user can enter the value
`234 OR 1=1` to cause the application to
generate the query `SELECT * FROM table WHERE ID=234 OR
1=1`. As a result, the server retrieves every row in
the table. This exposes every row and causes excessive server
load. The simplest way to protect from this type of attack is to
use single quotation marks around the numeric constants:
`SELECT * FROM table WHERE ID='234'`. If the
user enters extra information, it all becomes part of the
string. In a numeric context, MySQL automatically converts this
string to a number and strips any trailing nonnumeric characters
from it.

Sometimes people think that if a database contains only publicly
available data, it need not be protected. This is incorrect.
Even if it is permissible to display any row in the database,
you should still protect against denial of service attacks (for
example, those that are based on the technique in the preceding
paragraph that causes the server to waste resources). Otherwise,
your server becomes unresponsive to legitimate users.

Checklist:

- Enable strict SQL mode to tell the server to be more
  restrictive of what data values it accepts. See
  [Section 7.1.11, “Server SQL Modes”](sql-mode.md "7.1.11 Server SQL Modes").
- Try to enter single and double quotation marks
  (`'` and `"`) in all of
  your Web forms. If you get any kind of MySQL error,
  investigate the problem right away.
- Try to modify dynamic URLs by adding `%22`
  (`"`), `%23`
  (`#`), and `%27`
  (`'`) to them.
- Try to modify data types in dynamic URLs from numeric to
  character types using the characters shown in the previous
  examples. Your application should be safe against these and
  similar attacks.
- Try to enter characters, spaces, and special symbols rather
  than numbers in numeric fields. Your application should
  remove them before passing them to MySQL or else generate an
  error. Passing unchecked values to MySQL is very dangerous!
- Check the size of data before passing it to MySQL.
- Have your application connect to the database using a user
  name different from the one you use for administrative
  purposes. Do not give your applications any access
  privileges they do not need.

Many application programming interfaces provide a means of
escaping special characters in data values. Properly used, this
prevents application users from entering values that cause the
application to generate statements that have a different effect
than you intend:

- MySQL SQL statements: Use SQL prepared statements and accept
  data values only by means of placeholders; see
  [Section 15.5, “Prepared Statements”](sql-prepared-statements.md "15.5 Prepared Statements").
- MySQL C API: Use the
  [`mysql_real_escape_string_quote()`](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/c-api/8.0/en/mysql-real-escape-string-quote.html)
  API call. Alternatively, use the C API prepared statement
  interface and accept data values only by means of
  placeholders; see
  [C API Prepared Statement Interface](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/c-api/8.0/en/c-api-prepared-statement-interface.html).
- MySQL++: Use the `escape` and
  `quote` modifiers for query streams.
- PHP: Use either the `mysqli` or
  `pdo_mysql` extensions, and not the older
  `ext/mysql` extension. The preferred API's
  support the improved MySQL authentication protocol and
  passwords, as well as prepared statements with placeholders.
  See also [MySQL and PHP](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/apis-php/en/).

  If the older `ext/mysql` extension must be
  used, then for escaping use the
  [`mysql_real_escape_string_quote()`](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/c-api/8.0/en/mysql-real-escape-string-quote.html)
  function and not
  [`mysql_escape_string()`](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/c-api/8.0/en/mysql-escape-string.html) or
  `addslashes()` because only
  [`mysql_real_escape_string_quote()`](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/c-api/8.0/en/mysql-real-escape-string-quote.html)
  is character set-aware; the other functions can be
  “bypassed” when using (invalid) multibyte
  character sets.
- Perl DBI: Use placeholders or the `quote()`
  method.
- Java JDBC: Use a `PreparedStatement` object
  and placeholders.

Other programming interfaces might have similar capabilities.

#### Handle MySQL Error Messages Properly

It is the application's responsibility to intercept errors that
occur as a result of executing SQL statements with the MySQL
database server and handle them appropriately.

The information returned in a MySQL error is not gratuitous
because that information is key in debugging MySQL using
applications. It would be nearly impossible, for example, to
debug a common 10-way join [`SELECT`](select.md "15.2.13 SELECT Statement")
statement without providing information regarding which
databases, tables, and other objects are involved with problems.
Thus, MySQL errors must sometimes necessarily contain references
to the names of those objects.

A simple but insecure approach for an application when it
receives such an error from MySQL is to intercept it and display
it verbatim to the client. However, revealing error information
is a known application vulnerability type
([CWE-209](http://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/209.html))
and the application developer must ensure the application does
not have this vulnerability.

For example, an application that displays a message such as this
exposes both a database name and a table name to clients, which
is information a client might attempt to exploit:

```none
ERROR 1146 (42S02): Table 'mydb.mytable' doesn't exist
```

Instead, the proper behavior for an application when it receives
such an error from MySQL is to log appropriate information,
including the error information, to a secure audit location only
accessible to trusted personnel. The application can return
something more generic such as “Internal Error” to
the user.
