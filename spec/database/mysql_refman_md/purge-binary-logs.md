#### 15.4.1.1 PURGE BINARY LOGS Statement

```sql
PURGE { BINARY | MASTER } LOGS {
    TO 'log_name'
  | BEFORE datetime_expr
}
```

The binary log is a set of files that contain information about
data modifications made by the MySQL server. The log consists of
a set of binary log files, plus an index file (see
[Section 7.4.4, “The Binary Log”](binary-log.md "7.4.4 The Binary Log")).

The [`PURGE BINARY LOGS`](purge-binary-logs.md "15.4.1.1 PURGE BINARY LOGS Statement") statement
deletes all the binary log files listed in the log index file
prior to the specified log file name or date.
`BINARY` and `MASTER` are
synonyms. Deleted log files also are removed from the list
recorded in the index file, so that the given log file becomes
the first in the list.

[`PURGE BINARY LOGS`](purge-binary-logs.md "15.4.1.1 PURGE BINARY LOGS Statement") requires the
[`BINLOG_ADMIN`](privileges-provided.md#priv_binlog-admin) privilege. This
statement has no effect if the server was not started with the
[`--log-bin`](replication-options-binary-log.md#option_mysqld_log-bin) option to enable binary
logging.

Examples:

```sql
PURGE BINARY LOGS TO 'mysql-bin.010';
PURGE BINARY LOGS BEFORE '2019-04-02 22:46:26';
```

The `BEFORE` variant's
*`datetime_expr`* argument should
evaluate to a [`DATETIME`](datetime.md "13.2.2 The DATE, DATETIME, and TIMESTAMP Types") value (a
value in `'YYYY-MM-DD
hh:mm:ss'` format).

[`PURGE BINARY LOGS`](purge-binary-logs.md "15.4.1.1 PURGE BINARY LOGS Statement") is safe to run
while replicas are replicating. You need not stop them. If you
have an active replica that currently is reading one of the log
files you are trying to delete, this statement does not delete
the log file that is in use or any log files later than that
one, but it deletes any earlier log files. A warning message is
issued in this situation. However, if a replica is not connected
and you happen to purge one of the log files it has yet to read,
the replica cannot replicate after it reconnects.

[`PURGE BINARY LOGS`](purge-binary-logs.md "15.4.1.1 PURGE BINARY LOGS Statement") should not be
issued while a [`LOCK INSTANCE FOR
BACKUP`](lock-instance-for-backup.md "15.3.5 LOCK INSTANCE FOR BACKUP and UNLOCK INSTANCE Statements") statement is in effect for the instance,
because it contravenes the rules of the backup lock by removing
files from the server. From MySQL 8.0.28, this is disallowed.

To safely purge binary log files, follow this procedure:

1. On each replica, use
   [`SHOW
   REPLICA STATUS`](show-replica-status.md "15.7.7.35 SHOW REPLICA STATUS Statement") to check which log file it is
   reading.
2. Obtain a listing of the binary log files on the source with
   [`SHOW BINARY LOGS`](show-binary-logs.md "15.7.7.1 SHOW BINARY LOGS Statement").
3. Determine the earliest log file among all the replicas. This
   is the target file. If all the replicas are up to date, this
   is the last log file on the list.
4. Make a backup of all the log files you are about to delete.
   (This step is optional, but always advisable.)
5. Purge all log files up to but not including the target file.

`PURGE BINARY LOGS TO` and `PURGE
BINARY LOGS BEFORE` both fail with an error when binary
log files listed in the `.index` file had
been removed from the system by some other means (such as using
**rm** on Linux). (Bug #18199, Bug #18453) To
handle such errors, edit the `.index` file
(which is a simple text file) manually to ensure that it lists
only the binary log files that are actually present, then run
again the [`PURGE BINARY LOGS`](purge-binary-logs.md "15.4.1.1 PURGE BINARY LOGS Statement")
statement that failed.

Binary log files are automatically removed after the server's
binary log expiration period. Removal of the files can take
place at startup and when the binary log is flushed. The default
binary log expiration period is 30 days. You can specify an
alternative expiration period using the
[`binlog_expire_logs_seconds`](replication-options-binary-log.md#sysvar_binlog_expire_logs_seconds)
system variable. If you are using replication, you should
specify an expiration period that is no lower than the maximum
amount of time your replicas might lag behind the source.
