### 5.3.1 Creating and Selecting a Database

If the administrator creates your database for you when setting
up your permissions, you can begin using it. Otherwise, you need
to create it yourself:

```sql
mysql> CREATE DATABASE menagerie;
```

Under Unix, database names are case-sensitive (unlike SQL
keywords), so you must always refer to your database as
`menagerie`, not as
`Menagerie`, `MENAGERIE`, or
some other variant. This is also true for table names. (Under
Windows, this restriction does not apply, although you must
refer to databases and tables using the same lettercase
throughout a given query. However, for a variety of reasons, the
recommended best practice is always to use the same lettercase
that was used when the database was created.)

Note

If you get an error such as ERROR 1044 (42000):
Access denied for user 'micah'@'localhost' to database
'menagerie' when attempting to create a database,
this means that your user account does not have the necessary
privileges to do so. Discuss this with the administrator or
see [Section 8.2, “Access Control and Account Management”](access-control.md "8.2 Access Control and Account Management").

Creating a database does not select it for use; you must do that
explicitly. To make `menagerie` the current
database, use this statement:

```sql
mysql> USE menagerie
Database changed
```

Your database needs to be created only once, but you must select
it for use each time you begin a [**mysql**](mysql.md "6.5.1 mysql — The MySQL Command-Line Client")
session. You can do this by issuing a
[`USE`](use.md "15.8.4 USE Statement") statement as shown in the
example. Alternatively, you can select the database on the
command line when you invoke [**mysql**](mysql.md "6.5.1 mysql — The MySQL Command-Line Client"). Just
specify its name after any connection parameters that you might
need to provide. For example:

```terminal
$> mysql -h host -u user -p menagerie
Enter password: ********
```

Important

`menagerie` in the command just shown is
**not** your password. If you
want to supply your password on the command line after the
`-p` option, you must do so with no
intervening space (for example, as
`-ppassword`, not
as `-p password`).
However, putting your password on the command line is not
recommended, because doing so exposes it to snooping by other
users logged in on your machine.

Note

You can see at any time which database is currently selected
using [`SELECT`](select.md "15.2.13 SELECT Statement")
[`DATABASE()`](information-functions.md#function_database).
