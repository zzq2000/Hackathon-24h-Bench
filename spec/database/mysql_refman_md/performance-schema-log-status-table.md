#### 29.12.21.5 The log\_status Table

The [`log_status`](performance-schema-log-status-table.md "29.12.21.5 The log_status Table") table provides
information that enables an online backup tool to copy the
required log files without locking those resources for the
duration of the copy process.

When the [`log_status`](performance-schema-log-status-table.md "29.12.21.5 The log_status Table") table is
queried, the server blocks logging and related administrative
changes for just long enough to populate the table, then
releases the resources. The
[`log_status`](performance-schema-log-status-table.md "29.12.21.5 The log_status Table") table informs the
online backup which point it should copy up to in the source's
binary log and `gtid_executed` record, and
the relay log for each replication channel. It also provides
relevant information for individual storage engines, such as
the last log sequence number (LSN) and the LSN of the last
checkpoint taken for the `InnoDB` storage
engine.

The `log_status` table has these columns:

- `SERVER_UUID`

  The server UUID for this server instance. This is the
  generated unique value of the read-only system variable
  [`server_uuid`](replication-options.md#sysvar_server_uuid).
- `LOCAL`

  The log position state information from the source,
  provided as a single JSON object with the following keys:

  `binary_log_file`
  :   The name of the current binary log file.

  `binary_log_position`
  :   The current binary log position at the time the
      `log_status` table was accessed.

  `gtid_executed`
  :   The current value of the global server variable
      [`gtid_executed`](replication-options-gtids.md#sysvar_gtid_executed) at
      the time the `log_status` table
      was accessed. This information is consistent with
      the `binary_log_file` and
      `binary_log_position` keys.
- `REPLICATION`

  A JSON array of channels, each with the following
  information:

  `channel_name`
  :   The name of the replication channel. The default
      replication channel's name is the empty string
      (“”).

  `relay_log_file`
  :   The name of the current relay log file for the
      replication channel.

  `relay_log_pos`
  :   The current relay log position at the time the
      `log_status` table was accessed.
- `STORAGE_ENGINES`

  Relevant information from individual storage engines,
  provided as a JSON object with one key for each applicable
  storage engine.

The [`log_status`](performance-schema-log-status-table.md "29.12.21.5 The log_status Table") table has no
indexes.

The `BACKUP_ADMIN` privilege, as well as the
`SELECT` privilege, is required for access to
the [`log_status`](performance-schema-log-status-table.md "29.12.21.5 The log_status Table") table.

[`TRUNCATE TABLE`](truncate-table.md "15.1.37 TRUNCATE TABLE Statement") is not permitted
for the [`log_status`](performance-schema-log-status-table.md "29.12.21.5 The log_status Table") table.
