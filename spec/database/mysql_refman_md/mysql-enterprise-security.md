## 32.2 MySQL Enterprise Security Overview

MySQL Enterprise Edition provides plugins that implement security features using
external services:

- MySQL Enterprise Edition includes an authentication plugin that enables MySQL
  Server to use LDAP (Lightweight Directory Access Protocol) to
  authenticate MySQL users. LDAP Authentications supports user
  name and password, SASL, and GSSAPI/Kerberos authentication
  methods to LDAP services. For more information, see
  [Section 8.4.1.7, “LDAP Pluggable Authentication”](ldap-pluggable-authentication.md "8.4.1.7 LDAP Pluggable Authentication").
- MySQL Enterprise Edition includes an authentication plugin that enables MySQL
  Server to use Native Kerberos to authenticate MySQL users
  using there Kerberos Principals. For more information, see
  [Section 8.4.1.8, “Kerberos Pluggable Authentication”](kerberos-pluggable-authentication.md "8.4.1.8 Kerberos Pluggable Authentication").
- MySQL Enterprise Edition includes an authentication plugin that enables MySQL
  Server to use PAM (Pluggable Authentication Modules) to
  authenticate MySQL users. PAM enables a system to use a
  standard interface to access various kinds of authentication
  methods, such as Unix passwords or an LDAP directory. For more
  information, see
  [Section 8.4.1.5, “PAM Pluggable Authentication”](pam-pluggable-authentication.md "8.4.1.5 PAM Pluggable Authentication").
- MySQL Enterprise Edition includes an authentication plugin that performs external
  authentication on Windows, enabling MySQL Server to use native
  Windows services to authenticate client connections. Users who
  have logged in to Windows can connect from MySQL client
  programs to the server based on the information in their
  environment without specifying an additional password. For
  more information, see
  [Section 8.4.1.6, “Windows Pluggable Authentication”](windows-pluggable-authentication.md "8.4.1.6 Windows Pluggable Authentication").
- MySQL Enterprise Edition includes a suite of masking and de-identification
  functions that perform subsetting, random generation, and
  dictionary replacement to de-identify strings, numerics, phone
  numbers, emails and more. These functions enable masking
  existing data using several methods such as obfuscation
  (removing identifying characteristics), generation of
  formatted random data, and data replacement or substitution.
  For more information, see [Section 8.5, “MySQL Enterprise Data Masking and De-Identification”](data-masking.md "8.5 MySQL Enterprise Data Masking and De-Identification").
- MySQL Enterprise Edition includes a set of encryption functions based on the
  OpenSSL library that expose OpenSSL capabilities at the SQL
  level. For more information, see
  [Section 32.3, “MySQL Enterprise Encryption Overview”](mysql-enterprise-encryption.md "32.3 MySQL Enterprise Encryption Overview").
- MySQL Enterprise Edition 5.7 and higher includes a keyring plugin that uses
  Oracle Key Vault as a backend for keyring storage. For more
  information, see [Section 8.4.4, “The MySQL Keyring”](keyring.md "8.4.4 The MySQL Keyring").
- MySQL Transparent Data Encryption (TDE) provides at-rest
  encryption for MySQL Server for all files that might contain
  sensitive data. For more information, see
  [Section 17.13, “InnoDB Data-at-Rest Encryption”](innodb-data-encryption.md "17.13 InnoDB Data-at-Rest Encryption"),
  [Section 19.3.2, “Encrypting Binary Log Files and Relay Log Files”](replication-binlog-encryption.md "19.3.2 Encrypting Binary Log Files and Relay Log Files"), and
  [Encrypting Audit Log Files](audit-log-logging-configuration.md#audit-log-file-encryption "Encrypting Audit Log Files").

[Section 32.3, “MySQL Enterprise Encryption Overview”](mysql-enterprise-encryption.md "32.3 MySQL Enterprise Encryption Overview").
