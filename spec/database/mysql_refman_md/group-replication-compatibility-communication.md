#### 20.8.1.2 Group Replication Communication Protocol Version

A replication group uses a Group Replication communication
protocol version that can differ from the MySQL Server version
of the members. To check the group's communication protocol
version, issue the following statement on any member:

```sql
SELECT group_replication_get_communication_protocol();
```

The return value shows the oldest MySQL Server version that can
join this group and use the group's communication protocol.
Versions from MySQL 5.7.14 allow compression of messages, and
versions from MySQL 8.0.16 also allow fragmentation of messages.
Note that the
[`group_replication_get_communication_protocol()`](group-replication-functions-for-communication-protocol.md#function_group-replication-get-communication-protocol)
function returns the minimum MySQL version that the group
supports, which might differ from the version number that was
passed to the
[`group_replication_set_communication_protocol()`](group-replication-functions-for-communication-protocol.md#function_group-replication-set-communication-protocol)
function, and from the MySQL Server version that is installed on
the member where you use the function.

When you upgrade all the members of a replication group to a new
MySQL Server release, the Group Replication communication
protocol version is not automatically upgraded, in case there is
still a requirement to allow members at earlier releases to
join. If you do not need to support older members and want to
allow the upgraded members to use any added communication
capabilities, after the upgrade use the
[`group_replication_set_communication_protocol()`](group-replication-functions-for-communication-protocol.md#function_group-replication-set-communication-protocol)
function to upgrade the communication protocol, specifying the
new MySQL Server version to which you have upgraded the members.

[Section 20.5.1.4, “Setting a Group's Communication Protocol Version”](group-replication-communication-protocol.md "20.5.1.4 Setting a Group's Communication Protocol Version").
