#### 22.3.4.4 Delete Tables

You can use the `delete()` method to remove
some or all records from a table in a database. The X DevAPI
provides additional methods to use with the
`delete()` method to filter and order the
records to be deleted.

##### Delete Records Using Conditions

The following example passes search conditions to the
`delete()` method. All records matching the
condition are deleted from the city table. In this example,
one record matches the condition.

```mysqlsh
mysql-js> db.city.delete().where("Name = 'Olympia'")
```

##### Delete the First Record

To delete the first record in the city table, use the
`limit()` method with a value of 1.

```mysqlsh
mysql-js> db.city.delete().limit(1)
```

##### Delete All Records in a Table

You can delete all records in a table. To do so, use the
`delete()` method without specifying a search
condition.

Caution

Use care when you delete records without specifying a search
condition; doing so deletes all records from the table.

##### Drop a Table

The `dropCollection()` method is also used in
MySQL Shell to drop a relational table from a database. For
example, to drop the `citytest` table from
the `world_x` database, issue:

```mysqlsh
mysql-js> session.dropCollection("world_x", "citytest")
```
