### 7.4.3 The General Query Log

The general query log is a general record of what
[**mysqld**](mysqld.md "6.3.1 mysqld — The MySQL Server") is doing. The server writes information
to this log when clients connect or disconnect, and it logs each
SQL statement received from clients. The general query log can be
very useful when you suspect an error in a client and want to know
exactly what the client sent to [**mysqld**](mysqld.md "6.3.1 mysqld — The MySQL Server").

Each line that shows when a client connects also includes
`using
connection_type` to indicate
the protocol used to establish the connection.
*`connection_type`* is one of
`TCP/IP` (TCP/IP connection established without
SSL), `SSL/TLS` (TCP/IP connection established
with SSL), `Socket` (Unix socket file
connection), `Named Pipe` (Windows named pipe
connection), or `Shared Memory` (Windows shared
memory connection).

[**mysqld**](mysqld.md "6.3.1 mysqld — The MySQL Server") writes statements to the query log in
the order that it receives them, which might differ from the order
in which they are executed. This logging order is in contrast with
that of the binary log, for which statements are written after
they are executed but before any locks are released. In addition,
the query log may contain statements that only select data while
such statements are never written to the binary log.

When using statement-based binary logging on a replication source
server, statements received by its replicas are written to the
query log of each replica. Statements are written to the query log
of the source if a client reads events with the
[**mysqlbinlog**](mysqlbinlog.md "6.6.9 mysqlbinlog — Utility for Processing Binary Log Files") utility and passes them to the
server.

However, when using row-based binary logging, updates are sent as
row changes rather than SQL statements, and thus these statements
are never written to the query log when
[`binlog_format`](replication-options-binary-log.md#sysvar_binlog_format) is
`ROW`. A given update also might not be written
to the query log when this variable is set to
`MIXED`, depending on the statement used. See
[Section 19.2.1.1, “Advantages and Disadvantages of Statement-Based and Row-Based
Replication”](replication-sbr-rbr.md "19.2.1.1 Advantages and Disadvantages of Statement-Based and Row-Based Replication"), for more information.

By default, the general query log is disabled. To specify the
initial general query log state explicitly, use
[`--general_log[={0|1}]`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_general_log). With no
argument or an argument of 1,
[`--general_log`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_general_log) enables the log. With
an argument of 0, this option disables the log. To specify a log
file name, use
[`--general_log_file=file_name`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_general_log_file).
To specify the log destination, use the
[`log_output`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_log_output) system variable (as
described in [Section 7.4.1, “Selecting General Query Log and Slow Query Log Output Destinations”](log-destinations.md "7.4.1 Selecting General Query Log and Slow Query Log Output Destinations")).

Note

If you specify the `TABLE` log destination, see
[Log Tables and “Too many open files” Errors](log-destinations.md#log-destinations-tables-open-files "Log Tables and “Too many open files” Errors").

If you specify no name for the general query log file, the default
name is
`host_name.log`. The
server creates the file in the data directory unless an absolute
path name is given to specify a different directory.

To disable or enable the general query log or change the log file
name at runtime, use the global
[`general_log`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_general_log) and
[`general_log_file`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_general_log_file) system
variables. Set [`general_log`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_general_log) to 0
(or `OFF`) to disable the log or to 1 (or
`ON`) to enable it. Set
[`general_log_file`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_general_log_file) to specify the
name of the log file. If a log file already is open, it is closed
and the new file is opened.

When the general query log is enabled, the server writes output to
any destinations specified by the
[`log_output`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_log_output) system variable. If
you enable the log, the server opens the log file and writes
startup messages to it. However, further logging of queries to the
file does not occur unless the `FILE` log
destination is selected. If the destination is
`NONE`, the server writes no queries even if the
general log is enabled. Setting the log file name has no effect on
logging if the log destination value does not contain
`FILE`.

Server restarts and log flushing do not cause a new general query
log file to be generated (although flushing closes and reopens
it). To rename the file and create a new one, use the following
commands:

```terminal
$> mv host_name.log host_name-old.log
$> mysqladmin flush-logs general
$> mv host_name-old.log backup-directory
```

On Windows, use **rename** rather than
**mv**.

You can also rename the general query log file at runtime by
disabling the log:

```sql
SET GLOBAL general_log = 'OFF';
```

With the log disabled, rename the log file externally (for
example, from the command line). Then enable the log again:

```sql
SET GLOBAL general_log = 'ON';
```

This method works on any platform and does not require a server
restart.

To disable or enable general query logging for the current
session, set the session
[`sql_log_off`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_sql_log_off) variable to
`ON` or `OFF`. (This assumes
that the general query log itself is enabled.)

Passwords in statements written to the general query log are
rewritten by the server not to occur literally in plain text.
Password rewriting can be suppressed for the general query log by
starting the server with the
[`--log-raw`](server-options.md#option_mysqld_log-raw) option. This option may
be useful for diagnostic purposes, to see the exact text of
statements as received by the server, but for security reasons is
not recommended for production use. See also
[Section 8.1.2.3, “Passwords and Logging”](password-logging.md "8.1.2.3 Passwords and Logging").

An implication of password rewriting is that statements that
cannot be parsed (due, for example, to syntax errors) are not
written to the general query log because they cannot be known to
be password free. Use cases that require logging of all statements
including those with errors should use the
[`--log-raw`](server-options.md#option_mysqld_log-raw) option, bearing in mind
that this also bypasses password rewriting.

Password rewriting occurs only when plain text passwords are
expected. For statements with syntax that expect a password hash
value, no rewriting occurs. If a plain text password is supplied
erroneously for such syntax, the password is logged as given,
without rewriting.

The [`log_timestamps`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_log_timestamps) system
variable controls the time zone of timestamps in messages written
to the general query log file (as well as to the slow query log
file and the error log). It does not affect the time zone of
general query log and slow query log messages written to log
tables, but rows retrieved from those tables can be converted from
the local system time zone to any desired time zone with
[`CONVERT_TZ()`](date-and-time-functions.md#function_convert-tz) or by setting the
session [`time_zone`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_time_zone) system
variable.
