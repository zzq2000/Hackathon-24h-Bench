#### 20.7.6.1 Increasing the cache size

If a member is absent for a period that is not long enough for
it to be expelled from the group, it can reconnect and start
participating in the group again by retrieving missed
transactions from another member's XCom message cache. However,
if the transactions that happened during the member's absence
have been deleted from the other members' XCom message caches
because their maximum size limit was reached, the member cannot
reconnect in this way.

Group Replication's Group Communication System (GCS) alerts you,
by a warning message, when a message that is likely to be needed
for recovery by a member that is currently unreachable is
removed from the message cache. This warning message is logged
on all the active group members (only once for each unreachable
member). Although the group members cannot know for sure what
message was the last message seen by the unreachable member, the
warning message indicates that the cache size might not be
sufficient to support your chosen waiting period before a member
is expelled.

In this situation, consider increasing the
[`group_replication_message_cache_size`](group-replication-system-variables.md#sysvar_group_replication_message_cache_size)
limit with reference to the expected volume of messages in the
time period specified by the
[`group_replication_member_expel_timeout`](group-replication-system-variables.md#sysvar_group_replication_member_expel_timeout)
system variable plus the 5-second detection period, so that the
cache contains all the missed messages required for members to
return successfully. You can also consider increasing the cache
size limit temporarily if you expect a member to become
unreachable for an unusual period of time.
