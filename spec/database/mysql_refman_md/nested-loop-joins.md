#### 10.2.1.7 Nested-Loop Join Algorithms

MySQL executes joins between tables using a nested-loop
algorithm or variations on it.

- [Nested-Loop Join Algorithm](nested-loop-joins.md#nested-loop-join-algorithm "Nested-Loop Join Algorithm")
- [Block Nested-Loop Join Algorithm](nested-loop-joins.md#block-nested-loop-join-algorithm "Block Nested-Loop Join Algorithm")

##### Nested-Loop Join Algorithm

A simple nested-loop join (NLJ) algorithm reads rows from
the first table in a loop one at a time, passing each row to
a nested loop that processes the next table in the join.
This process is repeated as many times as there remain
tables to be joined.

Assume that a join between three tables
`t1`, `t2`, and
`t3` is to be executed using the following
join types:

```none
Table   Join Type
t1      range
t2      ref
t3      ALL
```

If a simple NLJ algorithm is used, the join is processed
like this:

```clike
for each row in t1 matching range {
  for each row in t2 matching reference key {
    for each row in t3 {
      if row satisfies join conditions, send to client
    }
  }
}
```

Because the NLJ algorithm passes rows one at a time from
outer loops to inner loops, it typically reads tables
processed in the inner loops many times.

##### Block Nested-Loop Join Algorithm

A Block Nested-Loop (BNL) join algorithm uses buffering of
rows read in outer loops to reduce the number of times that
tables in inner loops must be read. For example, if 10 rows
are read into a buffer and the buffer is passed to the next
inner loop, each row read in the inner loop can be compared
against all 10 rows in the buffer. This reduces by an order
of magnitude the number of times the inner table must be
read.

Prior to MySQL 8.0.18, this algorithm was applied for
equi-joins when no indexes could be used; in MySQL 8.0.18
and later, the hash join optimization is employed in such
cases. Starting with MySQL 8.0.20, the block nested loop is
no longer used by MySQL, and a hash join is employed for in
all cases where the block nested loop was used previously.
See [Section 10.2.1.4, “Hash Join Optimization”](hash-joins.md "10.2.1.4 Hash Join Optimization").

MySQL join buffering has these characteristics:

- Join buffering can be used when the join is of type
  [`ALL`](explain-output.md#jointype_all) or
  [`index`](explain-output.md#jointype_index) (in other
  words, when no possible keys can be used, and a full
  scan is done, of either the data or index rows,
  respectively), or
  [`range`](explain-output.md#jointype_range). Use of
  buffering is also applicable to outer joins, as
  described in [Section 10.2.1.12, “Block Nested-Loop and Batched Key Access Joins”](bnl-bka-optimization.md "10.2.1.12 Block Nested-Loop and Batched Key Access Joins").
- A join buffer is never allocated for the first
  nonconstant table, even if it would be of type
  [`ALL`](explain-output.md#jointype_all) or
  [`index`](explain-output.md#jointype_index).
- Only columns of interest to a join are stored in its
  join buffer, not whole rows.
- The [`join_buffer_size`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_join_buffer_size)
  system variable determines the size of each join buffer
  used to process a query.
- One buffer is allocated for each join that can be
  buffered, so a given query might be processed using
  multiple join buffers.
- A join buffer is allocated prior to executing the join
  and freed after the query is done.

For the example join described previously for the NLJ
algorithm (without buffering), the join is done as follows
using join buffering:

```clike
for each row in t1 matching range {
  for each row in t2 matching reference key {
    store used columns from t1, t2 in join buffer
    if buffer is full {
      for each row in t3 {
        for each t1, t2 combination in join buffer {
          if row satisfies join conditions, send to client
        }
      }
      empty join buffer
    }
  }
}

if buffer is not empty {
  for each row in t3 {
    for each t1, t2 combination in join buffer {
      if row satisfies join conditions, send to client
    }
  }
}
```

If *`S`* is the size of each stored
`t1`, `t2` combination in
the join buffer and *`C`* is the
number of combinations in the buffer, the number of times
table `t3` is scanned is:

```clike
(S * C)/join_buffer_size + 1
```

The number of `t3` scans decreases as the
value of [`join_buffer_size`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_join_buffer_size)
increases, up to the point when
[`join_buffer_size`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_join_buffer_size) is large
enough to hold all previous row combinations. At that point,
no speed is gained by making it larger.
