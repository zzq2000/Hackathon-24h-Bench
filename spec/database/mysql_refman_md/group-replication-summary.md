#### 20.1.1.2 Group Replication

Group Replication is a technique that can be used to implement
fault-tolerant systems. A replication group is a set of servers,
each of which has a complete copy of the data (a shared-nothing
replication scheme), which interact with each other through
message passing. The communication layer provides a set of
guarantees such as atomic message and total order message
delivery. These are very powerful properties that translate into
very useful abstractions that one can resort to build more
advanced database replication solutions.

MySQL Group Replication builds on top of such properties and
abstractions and implements a multi-source update everywhere
replication protocol. A replication group is formed by multiple
servers; each server in the group may execute transactions
independently at any time. Read/write transactions commit only
after they have been approved by the group. In other words, for
any read/write transaction the group needs to decide whether it
commits or not, so the commit operation is not a unilateral
decision from the originating server. Read-only transactions
need no coordination within the group and commit immediately.

When a read/write transaction is ready to commit at the
originating server, the server atomically broadcasts the write
values (the rows that were changed) and the corresponding write
set (the unique identifiers of the rows that were updated).
Because the transaction is sent through an atomic broadcast,
either all servers in the group receive the transaction or none
do. If they receive it, then they all receive it in the same
order with respect to other transactions that were sent before.
All servers therefore receive the same set of transactions in
the same order, and a global total order is established for the
transactions.

However, there may be conflicts between transactions that
execute concurrently on different servers. Such conflicts are
detected by inspecting and comparing the write sets of two
different and concurrent transactions, in a process called
*certification*. During certification,
conflict detection is carried out at row level: if two
concurrent transactions, that executed on different servers,
update the same row, then there is a conflict. The conflict
resolution procedure states that the transaction that was
ordered first commits on all servers, and the transaction
ordered second aborts, and is therefore rolled back on the
originating server and dropped by the other servers in the
group. For example, if t1 and t2 execute concurrently at
different sites, both changing the same row, and t2 is ordered
before t1, then t2 wins the conflict and t1 is rolled back. This
is in fact a distributed first commit wins rule. Note that if
two transactions are bound to conflict more often than not, then
it is a good practice to start them on the same server, where
they have a chance to synchronize on the local lock manager
instead of being rolled back as a result of certification.

For applying and externalizing the certified transactions, Group
Replication permits servers to deviate from the agreed order of
the transactions if this does not break consistency and
validity. Group Replication is an eventual consistency system,
meaning that as soon as the incoming traffic slows down or
stops, all group members have the same data content. While
traffic is flowing, transactions can be externalized in a
slightly different order, or externalized on some members before
the others. For example, in multi-primary mode, a local
transaction might be externalized immediately following
certification, although a remote transaction that is earlier in
the global order has not yet been applied. This is permitted
when the certification process has established that there is no
conflict between the transactions. In single-primary mode, on
the primary server, there is a small chance that concurrent,
non-conflicting local transactions might be committed and
externalized in a different order from the global order agreed
by Group Replication. On the secondaries, which do not accept
writes from clients, transactions are always committed and
externalized in the agreed order.

The following figure depicts the MySQL Group Replication
protocol and by comparing it to MySQL Replication (or even MySQL
semisynchronous replication) you can see some differences. Some
underlying consensus and Paxos related messages are missing from
this picture for the sake of clarity.

![A transaction received by Source 1 is executed. Source 1 then sends a message to the replication group, consisting of itself, Source 2, and Source 3. When all three members have reached consensus, they certify the transaction. Source 1 then writes the transaction to its binary log, commits it, and sends a response to the client application. Sources 2 and 3 write the transaction to their relay logs, then apply it, write it to the binary log, and commit it.](images/gr-replication-diagram.png)
