#### 8.4.1.8 Kerberos Pluggable Authentication

Note

Kerberos pluggable authentication is an extension included in
MySQL Enterprise Edition, a commercial product. To learn more about commercial
products, see <https://www.mysql.com/products/>.

MySQL Enterprise Edition supports an authentication method that enables users to
authenticate to MySQL Server using Kerberos, provided that
appropriate Kerberos tickets are available or can be obtained.

This authentication method is available in MySQL 8.0.26 and
higher, for MySQL servers and clients on Linux. It is useful in
Linux environments where applications have access to Microsoft
Active Directory, which has Kerberos enabled by default. As of
MySQL 8.0.27 (MySQL 8.0.32 for MIT Kerberos), the client-side
plugin is supported on Windows as well. The server-side plugin
is still supported only on Linux.

Note

Kerberos Authentication is not supported by MySQL Router or
MySQL Shell's AdminAPI.

Kerberos pluggable authentication provides these capabilities:

- External authentication: Kerberos authentication enables
  MySQL Server to accept connections from users defined
  outside the MySQL grant tables who have obtained the proper
  Kerberos tickets.
- Security: Kerberos uses tickets together with symmetric-key
  cryptography, enabling authentication without sending
  passwords over the network. Kerberos authentication supports
  userless and passwordless scenarios.

The following table shows the plugin and library file names. The
file name suffix might differ on your system. The file must be
located in the directory named by the
[`plugin_dir`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_plugin_dir) system variable. For
installation information, see
[Installing Kerberos Pluggable Authentication](kerberos-pluggable-authentication.md#kerberos-pluggable-authentication-installation "Installing Kerberos Pluggable Authentication").

**Table 8.24 Plugin and Library Names for Kerberos Authentication**

| Plugin or File | Plugin or File Name |
| --- | --- |
| Server-side plugin | `authentication_kerberos` |
| Client-side plugin | `authentication_kerberos_client` |
| Library file | `authentication_kerberos.so`, `authentication_kerberos_client.so` |

The server-side Kerberos authentication plugin is included only
in MySQL Enterprise Edition. It is not included in MySQL community distributions.
The client-side plugin is included in all distributions,
including community distributions. This enables clients from any
distribution to connect to a server that has the server-side
plugin loaded.

##### Prerequisites for Kerberos Pluggable Authentication

To use Kerberos pluggable authentication for MySQL, these
prerequisites must be satisfied:

- A Kerberos service must be available for the Kerberos
  authentication plugins to communicate with.
- Each Kerberos user (principal) to be authenticated by
  MySQL must be present in the database managed by the KDC
  server.
- A Kerberos client library must be available on systems
  where either the server-side or client-side Kerberos
  authentication plugin is used. In addition, GSSAPI is used
  as the interface for accessing Kerberos authentication, so
  a GSSAPI library must be available.

##### How Kerberos Authentication of MySQL Users Works

This section provides an overview of how MySQL and Kerberos
work together to authenticate MySQL users. For examples
showing how to set up MySQL accounts to use the Kerberos
authentication plugins, see
[Using Kerberos Pluggable Authentication](kerberos-pluggable-authentication.md#kerberos-pluggable-authentication-usage "Using Kerberos Pluggable Authentication").

Familiarity is assumed here with Kerberos concepts and
operation. The following list briefly defines several common
Kerberos terms. You may also find the Glossary section of
[RFC
4120](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4120) helpful.

- [Principal](glossary.md#glos_principal "principal"): A named
  entity, such as a user or server. In this discussion,
  certain principal-related terms occur frequently:

  - [SPN](glossary.md#glos_service_principal_name "service principal name"):
    Service principal name; the name of a principal that
    represents a service.
  - [UPN](glossary.md#glos_user_principal_name "user principal name"):
    User principal name; the name of a principal that
    represents a user.
- [KDC](glossary.md#glos_key_distribution_center "key distribution center"):
  The key distribution center, comprising the AS and TGS:

  - [AS](glossary.md#glos_authentication_server "authentication server"):
    The authentication server; provides the initial
    ticket-granting ticket needed to obtain additional
    tickets.
  - [TGS](glossary.md#glos_ticket_granting_server "ticket-granting server"):
    The ticket-granting server; provides additional
    tickets to Kerberos clients that possess a valid TGT.
- [TGT](glossary.md#glos_ticket_granting_ticket "ticket-granting ticket"):
  The ticket-granting ticket; presented to the TGS to obtain
  service tickets for service access.
- [ST](glossary.md#glos_service_ticket "service ticket"): A service
  ticket; provides access to a service such as that offered
  by a MySQL server.

Authentication using Kerberos requires a KDC server, for
example, as provided by Microsoft Active Directory.

Kerberos authentication in MySQL uses Generic Security Service
Application Program Interface (GSSAPI), which is a security
abstraction interface. Kerberos is an instance of a specific
security protocol that can be used through that abstract
interface. Using GSSAPI, applications authenticate to Kerberos
to obtain service credentials, then use those credentials in
turn to enable secure access to other services.

On Windows, the
`authentication_kerberos_client`
authentication plugin supports two modes, which the client
user can set at runtime or specify in an option file:

- `SSPI` mode: Security Support Provider
  Interface (SSPI) implements GSSAPI (see
  [Commands for Windows Clients in SSPI Mode](kerberos-pluggable-authentication.md#kerberos-usage-win-sspi-client-commands)). SSPI,
  while being compatible with GSSAPI at the wire level, only
  supports the Windows single sign-on scenario and
  specifically refers to the logged-on user. SSPI is the
  default mode on most Windows clients.
- `GSSAPI` mode: Supports GSSAPI through
  the MIT Kerberos library on Windows (see
  [Commands for Windows Clients in GSSAPI Mode](kerberos-pluggable-authentication.md#kerberos-usage-win-gssapi-client-commands)).

With the Kerberos authentication plugins, applications and
MySQL servers are able to use the Kerberos authentication
protocol to mutually authenticate users and MySQL services.
This way both the user and the server are able to verify each
other's identity. No passwords are sent over the network
and Kerberos protocol messages are protected against
eavesdropping and replay attacks.

Kerberos authentication follows these steps, where the
server-side and client-side parts are performed using the
`authentication_kerberos` and
`authentication_kerberos_client`
authentication plugins, respectively:

1. The MySQL server sends to the client application its
   service principal name. This SPN must be registered in the
   Kerberos system, and is configured on the server side
   using the
   [`authentication_kerberos_service_principal`](pluggable-authentication-system-variables.md#sysvar_authentication_kerberos_service_principal)
   system variable.
2. Using GSSAPI, the client application creates a Kerberos
   client-side authentication session and exchanges Kerberos
   messages with the Kerberos KDC:

   - The client obtains a ticket-granting ticket from the
     authentication server.
   - Using the TGT, the client obtains a service ticket for
     MySQL from the ticket-granting service.

   This step can be skipped or partially skipped if the TGT,
   ST, or both are already cached locally. The client
   optionally may use a client keytab file to obtain a TGT
   and ST without supplying a password.
3. Using GSSAPI, the client application presents the MySQL ST
   to the MySQL server.
4. Using GSSAPI, the MySQL server creates a Kerberos
   server-side authentication session. The server validates
   the user identity and the validity of the user request. It
   authenticates the ST using the service key configured in
   its service keytab file to determine whether
   authentication succeeds or fails, and returns the
   authentication result to the client.

Applications are able to authenticate using a provided user
name and password, or using a locally cached TGT or ST (for
example, created using **kinit** or similar).
This design therefore covers use cases ranging from completely
userless and passwordless connections, where Kerberos service
tickets are obtained from a locally stored Kerberos cache, to
connections where both user name and password are provided and
used to obtain a valid Kerberos service ticket from a KDC, to
send to the MySQL server.

As indicated in the preceding description, MySQL Kerberos
authentication uses two kinds of keytab files:

- On the client host, a client keytab file may be used to
  obtain a TGT and ST without supplying a password. See
  [Client Configuration Parameters for Kerberos Authentication](kerberos-pluggable-authentication.md#kerberos-pluggable-authentication-mysql-client-config-parameters "Client Configuration Parameters for Kerberos Authentication").
- On the MySQL server host, a server-side service keytab
  file is used to verify service tickets received by the
  MySQL server from clients. The keytab file name is
  configured using the
  [`authentication_kerberos_service_key_tab`](pluggable-authentication-system-variables.md#sysvar_authentication_kerberos_service_key_tab)
  system variable.

For information about keytab files, see
<https://web.mit.edu/kerberos/krb5-latest/doc/basic/keytab_def.html>.

##### Installing Kerberos Pluggable Authentication

This section describes how to install the server-side Kerberos
authentication plugin. For general information about
installing plugins, see [Section 7.6.1, “Installing and Uninstalling Plugins”](plugin-loading.md "7.6.1 Installing and Uninstalling Plugins").

Note

The server-side plugin is supported only on Linux systems.
On Windows systems, only the client-side plugin is supported
(as of MySQL 8.0.27), which can be used on a Windows system
to connect to a Linux server that uses Kerberos
authentication.

To be usable by the server, the plugin library file must be
located in the MySQL plugin directory (the directory named by
the [`plugin_dir`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_plugin_dir) system
variable). If necessary, configure the plugin directory
location by setting the value of
[`plugin_dir`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_plugin_dir) at server startup.

The server-side plugin library file base name is
`authentication_kerberos`. The file name
suffix for Unix and Unix-like systems is
`.so`.

To load the plugin at server startup, use the
[`--plugin-load-add`](server-options.md#option_mysqld_plugin-load-add) option to
name the library file that contains it. With this
plugin-loading method, the option must be given each time the
server starts. Also, specify values for any plugin-provided
system variables you wish to configure. The plugin exposes
these system variables, enabling its operation to be
configured:

- [`authentication_kerberos_service_principal`](pluggable-authentication-system-variables.md#sysvar_authentication_kerberos_service_principal):
  The MySQL service principal name (SPN). This name is sent
  to clients that attempt to authenticate using Kerberos.
  The SPN must be present in the database managed by the KDC
  server. The default is
  `mysql/host_name@realm_name`.
- [`authentication_kerberos_service_key_tab`](pluggable-authentication-system-variables.md#sysvar_authentication_kerberos_service_key_tab):
  The keytab file for authenticating tickets received from
  clients. This file must exist and contain a valid key for
  the SPN or authentication of clients will fail. The
  default is `mysql.keytab` in the data
  directory.

For details about all Kerberos authentication system
variables, see
[Section 8.4.1.13, “Pluggable Authentication System Variables”](pluggable-authentication-system-variables.md "8.4.1.13 Pluggable Authentication System Variables").

To load the plugin and configure it, put lines such as these
in your `my.cnf` file, using values for the
system variables that are appropriate for your installation:

```ini
[mysqld]
plugin-load-add=authentication_kerberos.so
authentication_kerberos_service_principal=mysql/krbauth.example.com@MYSQL.LOCAL
authentication_kerberos_service_key_tab=/var/mysql/data/mysql.keytab
```

After modifying `my.cnf`, restart the
server to cause the new settings to take effect.

Alternatively, to load the plugin at runtime, use this
statement:

```sql
INSTALL PLUGIN authentication_kerberos
  SONAME 'authentication_kerberos.so';
```

[`INSTALL PLUGIN`](install-plugin.md "15.7.4.4 INSTALL PLUGIN Statement") loads the plugin
immediately, and also registers it in the
`mysql.plugins` system table to cause the
server to load it for each subsequent normal startup without
the need for [`--plugin-load-add`](server-options.md#option_mysqld_plugin-load-add).

When you install the plugin at runtime without configuring its
system variables in the `my.cnf` file, the
system variable
[`authentication_kerberos_service_key_tab`](pluggable-authentication-system-variables.md#sysvar_authentication_kerberos_service_key_tab)
is set to the default value of
`mysql.keytab` in the data directory. The
value of this system variable cannot be changed at runtime, so
if you need to specify a different file, you need to add the
setting to your `my.cnf` file then restart
the MySQL server. For example:

```ini
[mysqld]
authentication_kerberos_service_key_tab=/var/mysql/data/mysql.keytab
```

If the keytab file is not in the correct place or does not
contain a valid SPN key, the MySQL server does not validate
this, but clients return authentication errors until you fix
the issue.

The
[`authentication_kerberos_service_principal`](pluggable-authentication-system-variables.md#sysvar_authentication_kerberos_service_principal)
system variable can be set and persisted at runtime without
restarting the server, by using a
[`SET
PERSIST`](set-variable.md "15.7.6.1 SET Syntax for Variable Assignment") statement:

```sql
SET PERSIST authentication_kerberos_service_principal='mysql/krbauth.example.com@MYSQL.LOCAL';
```

[`SET
PERSIST`](set-variable.md "15.7.6.1 SET Syntax for Variable Assignment") sets a value for the running MySQL instance.
It also saves the value, causing it to carry over to
subsequent server restarts. To change a value for the running
MySQL instance without having it carry over to subsequent
restarts, use the `GLOBAL` keyword rather
than `PERSIST`. See
[Section 15.7.6.1, “SET Syntax for Variable Assignment”](set-variable.md "15.7.6.1 SET Syntax for Variable Assignment").

To verify plugin installation, examine the Information Schema
[`PLUGINS`](information-schema-plugins-table.md "28.3.22 The INFORMATION_SCHEMA PLUGINS Table") table or use the
[`SHOW PLUGINS`](show-plugins.md "15.7.7.25 SHOW PLUGINS Statement") statement (see
[Section 7.6.2, “Obtaining Server Plugin Information”](obtaining-plugin-information.md "7.6.2 Obtaining Server Plugin Information")). For example:

```sql
mysql> SELECT PLUGIN_NAME, PLUGIN_STATUS
       FROM INFORMATION_SCHEMA.PLUGINS
       WHERE PLUGIN_NAME = 'authentication_kerberos';
+-------------------------+---------------+
| PLUGIN_NAME             | PLUGIN_STATUS |
+-------------------------+---------------+
| authentication_kerberos | ACTIVE        |
+-------------------------+---------------+
```

If a plugin fails to initialize, check the server error log
for diagnostic messages.

To associate MySQL accounts with the Kerberos plugin, see
[Using Kerberos Pluggable Authentication](kerberos-pluggable-authentication.md#kerberos-pluggable-authentication-usage "Using Kerberos Pluggable Authentication").

##### Using Kerberos Pluggable Authentication

This section describes how to enable MySQL accounts to connect
to the MySQL server using Kerberos pluggable authentication.
It is assumed that the server is running with the server-side
plugin enabled, as described in
[Installing Kerberos Pluggable Authentication](kerberos-pluggable-authentication.md#kerberos-pluggable-authentication-installation "Installing Kerberos Pluggable Authentication"),
and that the client-side plugin is available on the client
host.

- [Verify Kerberos Availability](kerberos-pluggable-authentication.md#kerberos-usage-kerberos-setup "Verify Kerberos Availability")
- [Create a MySQL Account That Uses Kerberos Authentication](kerberos-pluggable-authentication.md#kerberos-usage-mysql-account-setup "Create a MySQL Account That Uses Kerberos Authentication")
- [Use the MySQL Account to Connect to the MySQL Server](kerberos-pluggable-authentication.md#kerberos-usage-mysql-client-usage "Use the MySQL Account to Connect to the MySQL Server")
- [Client Configuration Parameters for Kerberos Authentication](kerberos-pluggable-authentication.md#kerberos-pluggable-authentication-mysql-client-config-parameters "Client Configuration Parameters for Kerberos Authentication")

###### Verify Kerberos Availability

The following example shows how to test availability of
Kerberos in Active Directory. The example makes these
assumptions:

- Active Directory is running on the host named
  `krbauth.example.com` with IP address
  `198.51.100.11`.
- MySQL-related Kerberos authentication uses the
  `MYSQL.LOCAL` domain, and also uses
  `MYSQL.LOCAL` as the realm name.
- A principal named `karl@MYSQL.LOCAL` is
  registered with the KDC. (In later discussion, this
  principal name is associated with the MySQL account that
  authenticates to the MySQL server using Kerberos.)

With those assumptions satisfied, follow this procedure:

1. Verify that the Kerberos library is installed and
   configured correctly in the operating system. For example,
   to configure a `MYSQL.LOCAL` domain and
   realm for use during MySQL authentication, the
   `/etc/krb5.conf` Kerberos configuration
   file should contain something like this:

   ```ini
   [realms]
     MYSQL.LOCAL = {
       kdc = krbauth.example.com
       admin_server = krbauth.example.com
       default_domain = MYSQL.LOCAL
     }
   ```
2. You may need to add an entry to
   `/etc/hosts` for the server host:

   ```simple
   198.51.100.11 krbauth krbauth.example.com
   ```
3. Check whether Kerberos authentication works correctly:

   1. Use **kinit** to authenticate to
      Kerberos:

      ```terminal
      $> kinit karl@MYSQL.LOCAL
      Password for karl@MYSQL.LOCAL: (enter password here)
      ```

      The command authenticates for the Kerberos principal
      named `karl@MYSQL.LOCAL`. Enter the
      principal's password when the command prompts for
      it. The KDC returns a TGT that is cached on the client
      side for use by other Kerberos-aware applications.
   2. Use **klist** to check whether the TGT
      was obtained correctly. The output should be similar
      to this:

      ```terminal
      $> klist
      Ticket cache: FILE:/tmp/krb5cc_244306
      Default principal: karl@MYSQL.LOCAL

      Valid starting       Expires              Service principal
      03/23/2021 08:18:33  03/23/2021 18:18:33  krbtgt/MYSQL.LOCAL@MYSQL.LOCAL
      ```

###### Create a MySQL Account That Uses Kerberos Authentication

MySQL authentication using the
`authentication_kerberos` authentication
plugin is based on a Kerberos user principal name (UPN). The
instructions here assume that a MySQL user named
`karl` authenticates to MySQL using Kerberos,
that the Kerberos realm is named
`MYSQL.LOCAL`, and that the user principal
name is `karl@MYSQL.LOCAL`. This UPN must be
registered in several places:

- The Kerberos administrator should register the user name
  as a Kerberos principal. This name includes a realm name.
  Clients use the principal name and password to
  authenticate with Kerberos and obtain a ticket-granting
  ticket (TGT).
- The MySQL DBA should create an account that corresponds to
  the Kerberos principal name and that authenticates using
  the Kerberos plugin.

Assume that the Kerberos user principal name has been
registered by the appropriate service administrator, and that,
as previously described in
[Installing Kerberos Pluggable Authentication](kerberos-pluggable-authentication.md#kerberos-pluggable-authentication-installation "Installing Kerberos Pluggable Authentication"),
the MySQL server has been started with appropriate
configuration settings for the server-side Kerberos plugin. To
create a MySQL account that corresponds to a Kerberos UPN of
`user@realm_name`,
the MySQL DBA uses a statement like this:

```sql
CREATE USER user
  IDENTIFIED WITH authentication_kerberos
  BY 'realm_name';
```

The account named by *`user`* can
include or omit the host name part. If the host name is
omitted, it defaults to `%` as usual. The
*`realm_name`* is stored as the
`authentication_string` value for the account
in the `mysql.user` system table.

To create a MySQL account that corresponds to the UPN
`karl@MYSQL.LOCAL`, use this statement:

```sql
CREATE USER 'karl'
  IDENTIFIED WITH authentication_kerberos
  BY 'MYSQL.LOCAL';
```

If MySQL must construct the UPN for this account, for example,
to obtain or validate tickets (TGTs or STs), it does so by
combining the account name (ignoring any host name part) and
the realm name. For example, the full account name resulting
from the preceding [`CREATE USER`](create-user.md "15.7.1.3 CREATE USER Statement")
statement is `'karl'@'%'`. MySQL constructs
the UPN from the user name part `karl`
(ignoring the host name part) and the realm name
`MYSQL.LOCAL` to produce
`karl@MYSQL.LOCAL`.

Note

Observe that when creating an account that authenticates
using `authentication_kerberos`, the
[`CREATE USER`](create-user.md "15.7.1.3 CREATE USER Statement") statement does
not include the UPN realm as part of the user name. Instead,
specify the realm (`MYSQL.LOCAL` in this
case) as the authentication string in the
`BY` clause. This differs from creating
accounts that use the
`authentication_ldap_sasl` SASL LDAP
authentication plugin with the GSSAPI/Kerberos
authentication method. For such accounts, the
[`CREATE USER`](create-user.md "15.7.1.3 CREATE USER Statement") statement does
include the UPN realm as part of the user name. See
[Create a MySQL Account That Uses GSSAPI/Kerberos for LDAP Authentication](ldap-pluggable-authentication.md#ldap-gssapi-mysql-account-setup "Create a MySQL Account That Uses GSSAPI/Kerberos for LDAP Authentication").

With the account set up, clients can use it to connect to the
MySQL server. The procedure depends on whether the client host
runs Linux or Windows, as indicated in the following
discussion.

Use of `authentication_kerberos` is subject
to the restriction that UPNs with the same user part but a
different realm part are not supported. For example, you
cannot create MySQL accounts that correspond to both these
UPNs:

```sql
kate@MYSQL.LOCAL
kate@EXAMPLE.COM
```

Both UPNs have a user part of `kate` but
differ in the realm part (`MYSQL.LOCAL`
versus `EXAMPLE.COM`). This is disallowed.

###### Use the MySQL Account to Connect to the MySQL Server

After a MySQL account that authenticates using Kerberos has
been set up, clients can use it to connect to the MySQL server
as follows:

1. Authenticate to Kerberos with the user principal name
   (UPN) and its password to obtain a ticket-granting ticket
   (TGT).
2. Use the TGT to obtain a service ticket (ST) for MySQL.
3. Authenticate to the MySQL server by presenting the MySQL
   ST.

The first step (authenticating to Kerberos) can be performed
various ways:

- Prior to connecting to MySQL:

  - On Linux or on Windows in `GSSAPI`
    mode, invoke **kinit** to obtain the
    TGT and save it in the Kerberos credentials cache.
  - On Windows in `SSPI` mode,
    authentication may already have been done at login
    time, which saves the TGT for the logged-in user in
    the Windows in-memory cache. **kinit**
    is not used and there is no Kerberos cache.
- When connecting to MySQL, the client program itself can
  obtain the TGT, if it can determine the required Kerberos
  UPN and password:

  - That information can come from sources such as command
    options or the operating system.
  - On Linux, clients also can use a keytab file or the
    `/etc/krb5.conf` configuration
    file. Windows clients in `GSSAPI`
    mode use a configuration file. Windows clients in
    `SSPI` mode use neither.

Details of the client commands for connecting to the MySQL
server differ for Linux and Windows, so each host type is
discussed separately, but these command properties apply
regardless of host type:

- Each command shown includes the following options, but
  each one may be omitted under certain conditions:

  - The [`--default-auth`](connection-options.md#option_general_default-auth)
    option specifies the name of the client-side
    authentication plugin
    (`authentication_kerberos_client`).
    This option may be omitted when the
    [`--user`](connection-options.md#option_general_user) option is
    specified because in that case MySQL can determine the
    plugin from the user account information sent by MySQL
    server.
  - The [`--plugin-dir`](connection-options.md#option_general_plugin-dir)
    option indicates to the client program the location of
    the `authentication_kerberos_client`
    plugin. This option may be omitted if the plugin is
    installed in the default (compiled-in) location.
- Commands should also include any other options such as
  [`--host`](connection-options.md#option_general_host) or
  [`--port`](connection-options.md#option_general_port) that are required
  to specify which MySQL server to connect to.
- Enter each command on a single line. If the command
  includes a [`--password`](connection-options.md#option_general_password)
  option to solicit a password, enter the password of the
  Kerberos UPN associated with the MySQL user when prompted.

**Connection
Commands for Linux Clients**

On Linux, the appropriate client command for connecting to the
MySQL server varies depending on whether the command
authenticates using a TGT from the Kerberos cache, or based on
command options for the MySQL user name and the UPN password:

- Prior to invoking the MySQL client program, the client
  user can obtain a TGT from the KDC independently of MySQL.
  For example, the client user can use
  **kinit** to authenticate to Kerberos by
  providing a Kerberos user principal name and the principal
  password:

  ```terminal
  $> kinit karl@MYSQL.LOCAL
  Password for karl@MYSQL.LOCAL: (enter password here)
  ```

  The resulting TGT for the UPN is cached and becomes
  available for use by other Kerberos-aware applications,
  such as programs that use the client-side Kerberos
  authentication plugin. In this case, invoke the client
  without specifying a user-name or password option:

  ```terminal
  mysql
    --default-auth=authentication_kerberos_client
    --plugin-dir=path/to/plugin/directory
  ```

  The client-side plugin finds the TGT in the cache, uses it
  to obtain a MySQL ST, and uses the ST to authenticate to
  the MySQL server.

  As just described, when the TGT for the UPN is cached,
  user-name and password options are not needed in the
  client command. If the command includes them anyway, they
  are handled as follows:

  - This command includes a user-name option:

    ```terminal
    mysql
      --default-auth=authentication_kerberos_client
      --plugin-dir=path/to/plugin/directory
      --user=karl
    ```

    In this case, authentication fails if the user name
    specified by the option does not match the user name
    part of the UPN in the TGT.
  - This command includes a password option, which you
    enter when prompted:

    ```terminal
    mysql
      --default-auth=authentication_kerberos_client
      --plugin-dir=path/to/plugin/directory
      --password
    ```

    In this case, the client-side plugin ignores the
    password. Because authentication is based on the TGT,
    it can succeed *even if the user-provided
    password is incorrect*. For this reason, the
    plugin produces a warning if a valid TGT is found that
    causes a password to be ignored.
- If the Kerberos cache contains no TGT, the client-side
  Kerberos authentication plugin itself can obtain the TGT
  from the KDC. Invoke the client with options for the MySQL
  user name and the password, then enter the UPN password
  when prompted:

  ```terminal
  mysql --default-auth=authentication_kerberos_client
    --plugin-dir=path/to/plugin/directory
    --user=karl
    --password
  ```

  The client-side Kerberos authentication plugin combines
  the user name (`karl`) and the realm
  specified in the user account
  (`MYSQL.LOCAL`) to construct the UPN
  (`karl@MYSQL.LOCAL`). The client-side
  plugin uses the UPN and password to obtain a TGT, uses the
  TGT to obtain a MySQL ST, and uses the ST to authenticate
  to the MySQL server.

  Or, suppose that the Kerberos cache contains no TGT and
  the command specifies a password option but no user-name
  option:

  ```terminal
  mysql --default-auth=authentication_kerberos_client
    --plugin-dir=path/to/plugin/directory
    --password
  ```

  The client-side Kerberos authentication plugin uses the
  operating system login name as the MySQL user name. It
  combines that user name and the realm in the user'
  MySQL account to construct the UPN. The client-side plugin
  uses the UPN and the password to obtain a TGT, uses the
  TGT to obtain a MySQL ST, and uses the ST to authenticate
  to the MySQL server.

If you are uncertain whether a TGT exists, you can use
**klist** to check.

Note

When the client-side Kerberos authentication plugin itself
obtains the TGT, the client user may not want the TGT to be
reused. As described in
[Client Configuration Parameters for Kerberos Authentication](kerberos-pluggable-authentication.md#kerberos-pluggable-authentication-mysql-client-config-parameters "Client Configuration Parameters for Kerberos Authentication"),
the local `/etc/krb5.conf` file can be used
to cause the client-side plugin to destroy the TGT when done
with it.

**Connection
Commands for Windows Clients in SSPI Mode**

On Windows, using the default client-side plugin option
(SSPI), the appropriate client command for connecting to the
MySQL server varies depending on whether the command
authenticates based on command options for the MySQL user name
and the UPN password, or instead uses a TGT from the Windows
in-memory cache. For details about GSSAPI mode on Windows, see
[Commands for Windows Clients in GSSAPI Mode](kerberos-pluggable-authentication.md#kerberos-usage-win-gssapi-client-commands).

A command can explicitly specify options for the MySQL user
name and the UPN password, or the command can omit those
options:

- This command includes options for the MySQL user name and
  UPN password:

  ```terminal
  mysql --default-auth=authentication_kerberos_client
    --plugin-dir=path/to/plugin/directory
    --user=karl
    --password
  ```

  The client-side Kerberos authentication plugin combines
  the user name (`karl`) and the realm
  specified in the user account
  (`MYSQL.LOCAL`) to construct the UPN
  (`karl@MYSQL.LOCAL`). The client-side
  plugin uses the UPN and password to obtain a TGT, uses the
  TGT to obtain a MySQL ST, and uses the ST to authenticate
  to the MySQL server.

  Any information in the Windows in-memory cache is ignored;
  the user-name and password option values take precedence.
- This command includes an option for the UPN password but
  not for the MySQL user name:

  ```terminal
  mysql
    --default-auth=authentication_kerberos_client
    --plugin-dir=path/to/plugin/directory
    --password
  ```

  The client-side Kerberos authentication plugin uses the
  logged-in user name as the MySQL user name and combines
  that user name and the realm in the user's MySQL
  account to construct the UPN. The client-side plugin uses
  the UPN and the password to obtain a TGT, uses the TGT to
  obtain a MySQL ST, and uses the ST to authenticate to the
  MySQL server.
- This command includes no options for the MySQL user name
  or UPN password:

  ```terminal
  mysql
    --default-auth=authentication_kerberos_client
    --plugin-dir=path/to/plugin/directory
  ```

  The client-side plugin obtains the TGT from the Windows
  in-memory cache, uses the TGT to obtain a MySQL ST, and
  uses the ST to authenticate to the MySQL server.

  This approach requires the client host to be part of the
  Windows Server Active Directory (AD) domain. If that is
  not the case, help the MySQL client discover the IP
  address for the AD domain by manually entering the AD
  server and realm as the DNS server and prefix:

  1. Start `console.exe` and select
     Network and Sharing Center.
  2. From the sidebar of the Network and Sharing Center
     window, select Change adapter
     settings.
  3. In the Network Connections window, right-click the
     network or VPN connection to configure and select
     Properties.
  4. From the Network tab, locate and
     click Internet Protocol Version 4
     (TCP/IPv4), and then click
     Properties.
  5. Click Advanced in the Internet
     Protocol Version 4 (TCP/IPv4) Properties dialog. The
     Advanced TCP/IP Settings dialog opens.
  6. From the DNS tab, add the Active
     Directory server and realm as a DNS server and prefix.
- This command includes an option for the MySQL user name
  but not for the UPN password:

  ```terminal
  mysql
    --default-auth=authentication_kerberos_client
    --plugin-dir=path/to/plugin/directory
    --user=karl
  ```

  The client-side Kerberos authentication plugin compares
  the name specified by the user-name option against the
  logged-in user name. If the names are the same, the plugin
  uses the logged-in user TGT for authentication. If the
  names differ, authentication fails.

**Connection
Commands for Windows Clients in GSSAPI Mode**

On Windows, the client user must specify
`GSSAPI` mode explicitly using the
`plugin_authentication_kerberos_client_mode`
plugin option to enable support through the MIT Kerberos
library. The default mode is `SSPI` (see
[Commands
for Windows Clients in SSPI Mode](kerberos-pluggable-authentication.md#kerberos-usage-win-sspi-client-commands)).

It is possible to specify `GSSAPI` mode:

- Prior to invoking the MySQL client program in an option
  file. The plugin variable name is valid using either
  underscores or dashes:

  ```ini
  [mysql]
  plugin_authentication_kerberos_client_mode=GSSAPI
  ```

  Or:

  ```ini
  [mysql]
  plugin-authentication-kerberos-client-mode=GSSAPI
  ```
- At runtime from the command line using the
  [**mysql**](mysql.md "6.5.1 mysql — The MySQL Command-Line Client") or [**mysqldump**](mysqldump.md "6.5.4 mysqldump — A Database Backup Program")
  client programs. For example, the following commands (with
  underscores or dashes) causes [**mysql**](mysql.md "6.5.1 mysql — The MySQL Command-Line Client") to
  connect to the server through the MIT Kerberos library on
  Windows.

  ```terminal
  mysql [connection-options] --plugin_authentication_kerberos_client_mode=GSSAPI
  ```

  Or:

  ```terminal
  mysql [connection-options] --plugin-authentication-kerberos-client-mode=GSSAPI
  ```
- Client users can select `GSSAPI` mode
  from MySQL Workbench and some MySQL connectors. On client
  hosts running Windows, you can override the default
  location of:

  - The Kerberos configuration file by setting the
    `KRB5_CONFIG` environment variable.
  - The default credential cache name with the
    `KRB5CCNAME` environment variable
    (for example,
    `KRB5CCNAME=DIR:/mydir/`).

  For specific client-side plugin information, see the
  documentation at <https://dev.mysql.com/doc/>.

The appropriate client command for connecting to the MySQL
server varies depending on whether the command authenticates
using a TGT from the MIT Kerberos cache, or based on command
options for the MySQL user name and the UPN password. GSSAPI
support through the MIT library on Windows is similar to
GSSAPI on Linux (see
[Commands
for Linux Clients](kerberos-pluggable-authentication.md#kerberos-usage-linux-client-commands)), with the following exceptions:

- Tickets are always retrieved from or placed into the MIT
  Kerberos cache on hosts running Windows.
- **kinit** runs with Functional Accounts on
  Windows that have narrow permissions and specific roles.
  The client user does not know the **kinit**
  password. For an overview, see
  <https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/11/tools/kinit.html>.
- If the client user supplies a password, the MIT Kerberos
  library on Windows decides whether to use it or rely on
  the existing ticket.
- The `destroy_tickets` parameter,
  described in
  [Client Configuration Parameters for Kerberos Authentication](kerberos-pluggable-authentication.md#kerberos-pluggable-authentication-mysql-client-config-parameters "Client Configuration Parameters for Kerberos Authentication"),
  is not supported because the MIT Kerberos library on
  Windows does not support the required API member
  (`get_profile_boolean`) to read its value from
  configuration file.

###### Client Configuration Parameters for Kerberos Authentication

This section applies only for client hosts running Linux, not
client hosts running Windows.

Note

A client host running Windows with the
`authentication_kerberos_client`
client-side Kerberos plugin set to `GSSAPI`
mode does support client configuration parameters, in
general, but the MIT Kerberos library on Windows does not
support the `destroy_tickets` parameter
described in this section.

If no valid ticket-granting ticket (TGT) exists at the time of
MySQL client application invocation, the application itself
may obtain and cache the TGT. If during the Kerberos
authentication process the client application causes a TGT to
be cached, any such TGT that was added can be destroyed after
it is no longer needed, by setting the appropriate
configuration parameter.

The `authentication_kerberos_client`
client-side Kerberos plugin reads the local
`/etc/krb5.conf` file. If this file is
missing or inaccessible, an error occurs. Assuming that the
file is accessible, it can include an optional
`[appdefaults]` section to provide
information used by the plugin. Place the information within
the `mysql` part of the section. For example:

```ini
[appdefaults]
  mysql = {
    destroy_tickets = true
  }
```

The client-side plugin recognizes these parameters in the
`mysql` section:

- The `destroy_tickets` value indicates
  whether the client-side plugin destroys the TGT after
  obtaining and using it. By default,
  `destroy_tickets` is
  `false`, but can be set to
  `true` to avoid TGT reuse. (This setting
  applies only to TGTs created by the client-side plugin,
  not TGTs created by other plugins or externally to MySQL.)

On the client host, a client keytab file may be used to obtain
a TGT and TS without supplying a password. For information
about keytab files, see
<https://web.mit.edu/kerberos/krb5-latest/doc/basic/keytab_def.html>.

##### Kerberos Authentication Debugging

The `AUTHENTICATION_KERBEROS_CLIENT_LOG`
environment variable enables or disables debug output for
Kerberos authentication.

Note

Despite `CLIENT` in the name
`AUTHENTICATION_KERBEROS_CLIENT_LOG`, the
same environment variable applies to the server-side plugin
as well as the client-side plugin.

On the server side, the permitted values are 0 (off) and 1
(on). Log messages are written to the server error log,
subject to the server error-logging verbosity level. For
example, if you are using priority-based log filtering, the
[`log_error_verbosity`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_log_error_verbosity) system
variable controls verbosity, as described in
[Section 7.4.2.5, “Priority-Based Error Log Filtering (log\_filter\_internal)”](error-log-priority-based-filtering.md "7.4.2.5 Priority-Based Error Log Filtering (log_filter_internal)").

On the client side, the permitted values are from 1 to 5 and
are written to the standard error output. The following table
shows the meaning of each log-level value.

| Log Level | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| 1 or not set | No logging |
| 2 | Error messages |
| 3 | Error and warning messages |
| 4 | Error, warning, and information messages |
| 5 | Error, warning, information, and debug messages |
