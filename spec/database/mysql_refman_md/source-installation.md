Building MySQL from the source code enables you to customize build
parameters, compiler optimizations, and installation location. For a
list of systems on which MySQL is known to run, see
<https://www.mysql.com/support/supportedplatforms/database.html>.

Before you proceed with an installation from source, check whether
Oracle produces a precompiled binary distribution for your platform
and whether it works for you. We put a great deal of effort into
ensuring that our binaries are built with the best possible options
for optimal performance. Instructions for installing binary
distributions are available in
[Section 2.2, “Installing MySQL on Unix/Linux Using Generic Binaries”](binary-installation.md "2.2 Installing MySQL on Unix/Linux Using Generic Binaries").

If you are interested in building MySQL from a source distribution
using build options the same as or similar to those use by Oracle to
produce binary distributions on your platform, obtain a binary
distribution, unpack it, and look in the
`docs/INFO_BIN` file, which contains information
about how that MySQL distribution was configured and compiled.

Warning

Building MySQL with nonstandard options may lead to reduced
functionality, performance, or security.

The MySQL source code contains internal documentation written using
Doxygen. The generated Doxygen content is available at
<https://dev.mysql.com/doc/index-other.html>. It is also possible to
generate this content locally from a MySQL source distribution using
the instructions at [Section 2.8.10, “Generating MySQL Doxygen Documentation Content”](source-installation-doxygen.md "2.8.10 Generating MySQL Doxygen Documentation Content").
