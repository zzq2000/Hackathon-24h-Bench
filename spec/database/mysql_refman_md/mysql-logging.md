#### 6.5.1.3 mysql Client Logging

The [**mysql**](mysql.md "6.5.1 mysql — The MySQL Command-Line Client") client can do these types of
logging for statements executed interactively:

- On Unix, [**mysql**](mysql.md "6.5.1 mysql — The MySQL Command-Line Client") writes the statements to a
  history file. By default, this file is named
  `.mysql_history` in your home directory.
  To specify a different file, set the value of the
  `MYSQL_HISTFILE` environment variable.
- On all platforms, if the `--syslog` option is
  given, [**mysql**](mysql.md "6.5.1 mysql — The MySQL Command-Line Client") writes the statements to the
  system logging facility. On Unix, this is
  `syslog`; on Windows, it is the Windows
  Event Log. The destination where logged messages appear is
  system dependent. On Linux, the destination is often the
  `/var/log/messages` file.

The following discussion describes characteristics that apply to
all logging types and provides information specific to each
logging type.

- [syslog Logging Characteristics](mysql-logging.md#mysql-logging-syslog "syslog Logging Characteristics")

##### How Logging Occurs

For each enabled logging destination, statement logging occurs
as follows:

- Statements are logged only when executed interactively.
  Statements are noninteractive, for example, when read from a
  file or a pipe. It is also possible to suppress statement
  logging by using the [`--batch`](mysql-command-options.md#option_mysql_batch)
  or [`--execute`](mysql-command-options.md#option_mysql_execute) option.
- Statements are ignored and not logged if they match any
  pattern in the “ignore” list. This list is
  described later.
- [**mysql**](mysql.md "6.5.1 mysql — The MySQL Command-Line Client") logs each nonignored, nonempty
  statement line individually.
- If a nonignored statement spans multiple lines (not
  including the terminating delimiter),
  [**mysql**](mysql.md "6.5.1 mysql — The MySQL Command-Line Client") concatenates the lines to form the
  complete statement, maps newlines to spaces, and logs the
  result, plus a delimiter.

Consequently, an input statement that spans multiple lines can
be logged twice. Consider this input:

```sql
mysql> SELECT
    -> 'Today is'
    -> ,
    -> CURDATE()
    -> ;
```

In this case, [**mysql**](mysql.md "6.5.1 mysql — The MySQL Command-Line Client") logs the
“SELECT”, “'Today is'”,
“,”, “CURDATE()”, and “;”
lines as it reads them. It also logs the complete statement,
after mapping `SELECT\n'Today
is'\n,\nCURDATE()` to `SELECT 'Today is' ,
CURDATE()`, plus a delimiter. Thus, these lines appear
in logged output:

```sql
SELECT
'Today is'
,
CURDATE()
;
SELECT 'Today is' , CURDATE();
```

[**mysql**](mysql.md "6.5.1 mysql — The MySQL Command-Line Client") ignores for logging purposes statements
that match any pattern in the “ignore” list. By
default, the pattern list is
`"*IDENTIFIED*:*PASSWORD*"`, to ignore
statements that refer to passwords. Pattern matching is not
case-sensitive. Within patterns, two characters are special:

- `?` matches any single character.
- `*` matches any sequence of zero or more
  characters.

To specify additional patterns, use the
[`--histignore`](mysql-command-options.md#option_mysql_histignore) option or set the
`MYSQL_HISTIGNORE` environment variable. (If
both are specified, the option value takes precedence.) The
value should be a list of one or more colon-separated patterns,
which are appended to the default pattern list.

Patterns specified on the command line might need to be quoted
or escaped to prevent your command interpreter from treating
them specially. For example, to suppress logging for
`UPDATE` and `DELETE`
statements in addition to statements that refer to passwords,
invoke [**mysql**](mysql.md "6.5.1 mysql — The MySQL Command-Line Client") like this:

```terminal
mysql --histignore="*UPDATE*:*DELETE*"
```

##### Controlling the History File

The `.mysql_history` file should be protected
with a restrictive access mode because sensitive information
might be written to it, such as the text of SQL statements that
contain passwords. See [Section 8.1.2.1, “End-User Guidelines for Password Security”](password-security-user.md "8.1.2.1 End-User Guidelines for Password Security").
Statements in the file are accessible from the
[**mysql**](mysql.md "6.5.1 mysql — The MySQL Command-Line Client") client when the
**up-arrow** key is used to recall the history. See
[Disabling Interactive History](mysql-tips.md#mysql-history "Disabling Interactive History").

If you do not want to maintain a history file, first remove
`.mysql_history` if it exists. Then use
either of the following techniques to prevent it from being
created again:

- Set the `MYSQL_HISTFILE` environment
  variable to `/dev/null`. To cause this
  setting to take effect each time you log in, put it in one
  of your shell's startup files.
- Create `.mysql_history` as a symbolic
  link to `/dev/null`; this need be done
  only once:

  ```terminal
  ln -s /dev/null $HOME/.mysql_history
  ```

##### syslog Logging Characteristics

If the `--syslog` option is given,
[**mysql**](mysql.md "6.5.1 mysql — The MySQL Command-Line Client") writes interactive statements to the
system logging facility. Message logging has the following
characteristics.

Logging occurs at the “information” level. This
corresponds to the `LOG_INFO` priority for
`syslog` on Unix/Linux
`syslog` capability and to
`EVENTLOG_INFORMATION_TYPE` for the Windows
Event Log. Consult your system documentation for configuration
of your logging capability.

Message size is limited to 1024 bytes.

Messages consist of the identifier
`MysqlClient` followed by these values:

- `SYSTEM_USER`

  The operating system user name (login name) or
  `--` if the user is unknown.
- `MYSQL_USER`

  The MySQL user name (specified with the
  [`--user`](mysql-command-options.md#option_mysql_user) option) or
  `--` if the user is unknown.
- `CONNECTION_ID`:

  The client connection identifier. This is the same as the
  [`CONNECTION_ID()`](information-functions.md#function_connection-id) function
  value within the session.
- `DB_SERVER`

  The server host or `--` if the host is
  unknown.
- `DB`

  The default database or `--` if no database
  has been selected.
- `QUERY`

  The text of the logged statement.

Here is a sample of output generated on Linux by using
`--syslog`. This output is formatted for
readability; each logged message actually takes a single line.

```none
Mar  7 12:39:25 myhost MysqlClient[20824]:
  SYSTEM_USER:'oscar', MYSQL_USER:'my_oscar', CONNECTION_ID:23,
  DB_SERVER:'127.0.0.1', DB:'--', QUERY:'USE test;'
Mar  7 12:39:28 myhost MysqlClient[20824]:
  SYSTEM_USER:'oscar', MYSQL_USER:'my_oscar', CONNECTION_ID:23,
  DB_SERVER:'127.0.0.1', DB:'test', QUERY:'SHOW TABLES;'
```
