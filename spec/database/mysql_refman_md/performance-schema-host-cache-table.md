#### 29.12.21.3 The host\_cache Table

The MySQL server maintains an in-memory host cache that
contains client host name and IP address information and is
used to avoid Domain Name System (DNS) lookups. The
[`host_cache`](performance-schema-host-cache-table.md "29.12.21.3 The host_cache Table") table exposes the
contents of this cache. The
[`host_cache_size`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_host_cache_size) system
variable controls the size of the host cache, as well as the
size of the [`host_cache`](performance-schema-host-cache-table.md "29.12.21.3 The host_cache Table") table. For
operational and configuration information about the host
cache, see [Section 7.1.12.3, “DNS Lookups and the Host Cache”](host-cache.md "7.1.12.3 DNS Lookups and the Host Cache").

Because the [`host_cache`](performance-schema-host-cache-table.md "29.12.21.3 The host_cache Table") table
exposes the contents of the host cache, it can be examined
using [`SELECT`](select.md "15.2.13 SELECT Statement") statements. This
may help you diagnose the causes of connection problems.

The [`host_cache`](performance-schema-host-cache-table.md "29.12.21.3 The host_cache Table") table has these
columns:

- `IP`

  The IP address of the client that connected to the server,
  expressed as a string.
- `HOST`

  The resolved DNS host name for that client IP, or
  `NULL` if the name is unknown.
- `HOST_VALIDATED`

  Whether the IP-to-host name-to-IP DNS resolution was
  performed successfully for the client IP. If
  `HOST_VALIDATED` is
  `YES`, the `HOST` column
  is used as the host name corresponding to the IP so that
  additional calls to DNS can be avoided. While
  `HOST_VALIDATED` is
  `NO`, DNS resolution is attempted for
  each connection attempt, until it eventually completes
  with either a valid result or a permanent error. This
  information enables the server to avoid caching bad or
  missing host names during temporary DNS failures, which
  would negatively affect clients forever.
- `SUM_CONNECT_ERRORS`

  The number of connection errors that are deemed
  “blocking” (assessed against the
  [`max_connect_errors`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_max_connect_errors) system
  variable). Only protocol handshake errors are counted, and
  only for hosts that passed validation
  (`HOST_VALIDATED = YES`).

  Once `SUM_CONNECT_ERRORS` for a given
  host reaches the value of
  [`max_connect_errors`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_max_connect_errors), new
  connections from that host are blocked. The
  `SUM_CONNECT_ERRORS` value can exceed the
  [`max_connect_errors`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_max_connect_errors) value
  because multiple connection attempts from a host can occur
  simultaneously while the host is not blocked. Any or all
  of them can fail, independently incrementing
  `SUM_CONNECT_ERRORS`, possibly beyond the
  value of
  [`max_connect_errors`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_max_connect_errors).

  Suppose that
  [`max_connect_errors`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_max_connect_errors) is 200
  and `SUM_CONNECT_ERRORS` for a given host
  is 199. If 10 clients attempt to connect from that host
  simultaneously, none of them are blocked because
  `SUM_CONNECT_ERRORS` has not reached 200.
  If blocking errors occur for five of the clients,
  `SUM_CONNECT_ERRORS` is increased by one
  for each client, for a resulting
  `SUM_CONNECT_ERRORS` value of 204. The
  other five clients succeed and are not blocked because the
  value of `SUM_CONNECT_ERRORS` when their
  connection attempts began had not reached 200. New
  connections from the host that begin after
  `SUM_CONNECT_ERRORS` reaches 200 are
  blocked.
- `COUNT_HOST_BLOCKED_ERRORS`

  The number of connections that were blocked because
  `SUM_CONNECT_ERRORS` exceeded the value
  of the [`max_connect_errors`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_max_connect_errors)
  system variable.
- `COUNT_NAMEINFO_TRANSIENT_ERRORS`

  The number of transient errors during IP-to-host name DNS
  resolution.
- `COUNT_NAMEINFO_PERMANENT_ERRORS`

  The number of permanent errors during IP-to-host name DNS
  resolution.
- `COUNT_FORMAT_ERRORS`

  The number of host name format errors. MySQL does not
  perform matching of `Host` column values
  in the `mysql.user` system table against
  host names for which one or more of the initial components
  of the name are entirely numeric, such as
  `1.2.example.com`. The client IP address
  is used instead. For the rationale why this type of
  matching does not occur, see
  [Section 8.2.4, “Specifying Account Names”](account-names.md "8.2.4 Specifying Account Names").
- `COUNT_ADDRINFO_TRANSIENT_ERRORS`

  The number of transient errors during host name-to-IP
  reverse DNS resolution.
- `COUNT_ADDRINFO_PERMANENT_ERRORS`

  The number of permanent errors during host name-to-IP
  reverse DNS resolution.
- `COUNT_FCRDNS_ERRORS`

  The number of forward-confirmed reverse DNS errors. These
  errors occur when IP-to-host name-to-IP DNS resolution
  produces an IP address that does not match the client
  originating IP address.
- `COUNT_HOST_ACL_ERRORS`

  The number of errors that occur because no users are
  permitted to connect from the client host. In such cases,
  the server returns
  [`ER_HOST_NOT_PRIVILEGED`](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/mysql-errors/8.0/en/server-error-reference.html#error_er_host_not_privileged) and
  does not even ask for a user name or password.
- `COUNT_NO_AUTH_PLUGIN_ERRORS`

  The number of errors due to requests for an unavailable
  authentication plugin. A plugin can be unavailable if, for
  example, it was never loaded or a load attempt failed.
- `COUNT_AUTH_PLUGIN_ERRORS`

  The number of errors reported by authentication plugins.

  An authentication plugin can report different error codes
  to indicate the root cause of a failure. Depending on the
  type of error, one of these columns is incremented:
  `COUNT_AUTHENTICATION_ERRORS`,
  `COUNT_AUTH_PLUGIN_ERRORS`,
  `COUNT_HANDSHAKE_ERRORS`. New return
  codes are an optional extension to the existing plugin
  API. Unknown or unexpected plugin errors are counted in
  the `COUNT_AUTH_PLUGIN_ERRORS` column.
- `COUNT_HANDSHAKE_ERRORS`

  The number of errors detected at the wire protocol level.
- `COUNT_PROXY_USER_ERRORS`

  The number of errors detected when proxy user A is proxied
  to another user B who does not exist.
- `COUNT_PROXY_USER_ACL_ERRORS`

  The number of errors detected when proxy user A is proxied
  to another user B who does exist but for whom A does not
  have the [`PROXY`](privileges-provided.md#priv_proxy) privilege.
- `COUNT_AUTHENTICATION_ERRORS`

  The number of errors caused by failed authentication.
- `COUNT_SSL_ERRORS`

  The number of errors due to SSL problems.
- `COUNT_MAX_USER_CONNECTIONS_ERRORS`

  The number of errors caused by exceeding per-user
  connection quotas. See [Section 8.2.21, “Setting Account Resource Limits”](user-resources.md "8.2.21 Setting Account Resource Limits").
- `COUNT_MAX_USER_CONNECTIONS_PER_HOUR_ERRORS`

  The number of errors caused by exceeding per-user
  connections-per-hour quotas. See
  [Section 8.2.21, “Setting Account Resource Limits”](user-resources.md "8.2.21 Setting Account Resource Limits").
- `COUNT_DEFAULT_DATABASE_ERRORS`

  The number of errors related to the default database. For
  example, the database does not exist or the user has no
  privileges to access it.
- `COUNT_INIT_CONNECT_ERRORS`

  The number of errors caused by execution failures of
  statements in the
  [`init_connect`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_init_connect) system
  variable value.
- `COUNT_LOCAL_ERRORS`

  The number of errors local to the server implementation
  and not related to the network, authentication, or
  authorization. For example, out-of-memory conditions fall
  into this category.
- `COUNT_UNKNOWN_ERRORS`

  The number of other, unknown errors not accounted for by
  other columns in this table. This column is reserved for
  future use, in case new error conditions must be reported,
  and if preserving the backward compatibility and structure
  of the [`host_cache`](performance-schema-host-cache-table.md "29.12.21.3 The host_cache Table") table is
  required.
- `FIRST_SEEN`

  The timestamp of the first connection attempt seen from
  the client in the `IP` column.
- `LAST_SEEN`

  The timestamp of the most recent connection attempt seen
  from the client in the `IP` column.
- `FIRST_ERROR_SEEN`

  The timestamp of the first error seen from the client in
  the `IP` column.
- `LAST_ERROR_SEEN`

  The timestamp of the most recent error seen from the
  client in the `IP` column.

The [`host_cache`](performance-schema-host-cache-table.md "29.12.21.3 The host_cache Table") table has these
indexes:

- Primary key on (`IP`)
- Index on (`HOST`)

[`TRUNCATE TABLE`](truncate-table.md "15.1.37 TRUNCATE TABLE Statement") is permitted for
the [`host_cache`](performance-schema-host-cache-table.md "29.12.21.3 The host_cache Table") table. It requires
the [`DROP`](privileges-provided.md#priv_drop) privilege for the
table. Truncating the table flushes the host cache, which has
the effects described in
[Flushing the Host Cache](host-cache.md#host-cache-flushing "Flushing the Host Cache").
