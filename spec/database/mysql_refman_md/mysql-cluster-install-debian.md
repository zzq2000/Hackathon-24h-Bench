#### 25.3.1.3 Installing NDB Cluster Using .deb Files

The section provides information about installing NDB Cluster on
Debian and related Linux distributions such Ubuntu using the
`.deb` files supplied by Oracle for this
purpose.

Oracle also provides an NDB Cluster APT repository for Debian
and other distributions. See
[*Installing
MySQL NDB Cluster Using the APT Repository*](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/mysql-apt-repo-quick-guide/en/#repo-qg-apt-cluster-install),
for instructions and additional information.

Oracle provides `.deb` installer files for
NDB Cluster for 32-bit and 64-bit platforms. For a Debian-based
system, only a single installer file is necessary. This file is
named using the pattern shown here, according to the applicable
NDB Cluster version, Debian version, and architecture:

```simple
mysql-cluster-gpl-ndbver-debiandebianver-arch.deb
```

Here, *`ndbver`* is the 3-part
`NDB` engine version number,
*`debianver`* is the major version of
Debian (`8` or `9`), and
*`arch`* is one of
`i686` or `x86_64`. In the
examples that follow, we assume you wish to install NDB
8.0.43 on a 64-bit Debian 9 system; in this
case, the installer file is named
`mysql-cluster-gpl-8.0.43-debian9-x86_64.deb-bundle.tar`.

Once you have downloaded the appropriate
`.deb` file, you can untar it, and then
install it from the command line using `dpkg`,
like this:

```terminal
$> dpkg -i mysql-cluster-gpl-8.0.43-debian9-i686.deb
```

You can also remove it using `dpkg` as shown
here:

```terminal
$> dpkg -r mysql
```

The installer file should also be compatible with most graphical
package managers that work with `.deb` files,
such as `GDebi` for the Gnome desktop.

The `.deb` file installs NDB Cluster under
`/opt/mysql/server-version/`,
where *`version`* is the 2-part release
series version for the included MySQL server. For NDB 8.0, this
is always `8.0`. The directory layout is the
same as that for the generic Linux binary distribution (see
[Table 2.3, “MySQL Installation Layout for Generic Unix/Linux Binary Package”](binary-installation.md#binary-installation-layout "Table 2.3 MySQL Installation Layout for Generic Unix/Linux Binary Package")), with the
exception that startup scripts and configuration files are found
in `support-files` instead of
`share`. All NDB Cluster executables, such as
[**ndb\_mgm**](mysql-cluster-programs-ndb-mgm.md "25.5.5 ndb_mgm — The NDB Cluster Management Client"), [**ndbd**](mysql-cluster-programs-ndbd.md "25.5.1 ndbd — The NDB Cluster Data Node Daemon"), and
[**ndb\_mgmd**](mysql-cluster-programs-ndb-mgmd.md "25.5.4 ndb_mgmd — The NDB Cluster Management Server Daemon"), are placed in the
`bin` directory.
