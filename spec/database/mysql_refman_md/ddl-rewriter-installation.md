#### 7.6.5.1 Installing or Uninstalling ddl\_rewriter

This section describes how to install or uninstall the
`ddl_rewriter` plugin. For general information
about installing plugins, see [Section 7.6.1, “Installing and Uninstalling Plugins”](plugin-loading.md "7.6.1 Installing and Uninstalling Plugins").

Note

If installed, the `ddl_rewriter` plugin
involves some minimal overhead even when disabled. To avoid
this overhead, install `ddl_rewriter` only
for the period during which you intend to use it.

The primary use case is modification of statements restored
from dump files, so the typical usage pattern is: 1) Install
the plugin; 2) restore the dump file or files; 3) uninstall
the plugin.

To be usable by the server, the plugin library file must be
located in the MySQL plugin directory (the directory named by
the [`plugin_dir`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_plugin_dir) system
variable). If necessary, configure the plugin directory location
by setting the value of
[`plugin_dir`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_plugin_dir) at server startup.

The plugin library file base name is
`ddl_rewriter`. The file name suffix differs
per platform (for example, `.so` for Unix and
Unix-like systems, `.dll` for Windows).

To install the `ddl_rewriter` plugin, use the
[`INSTALL PLUGIN`](install-plugin.md "15.7.4.4 INSTALL PLUGIN Statement") statement,
adjusting the `.so` suffix for your platform
as necessary:

```sql
INSTALL PLUGIN ddl_rewriter SONAME 'ddl_rewriter.so';
```

To verify plugin installation, examine the Information Schema
[`PLUGINS`](information-schema-plugins-table.md "28.3.22 The INFORMATION_SCHEMA PLUGINS Table") table or use the
[`SHOW PLUGINS`](show-plugins.md "15.7.7.25 SHOW PLUGINS Statement") statement (see
[Section 7.6.2, “Obtaining Server Plugin Information”](obtaining-plugin-information.md "7.6.2 Obtaining Server Plugin Information")). For example:

```sql
mysql> SELECT PLUGIN_NAME, PLUGIN_STATUS, PLUGIN_TYPE
       FROM INFORMATION_SCHEMA.PLUGINS
       WHERE PLUGIN_NAME LIKE 'ddl%';
+--------------+---------------+-------------+
| PLUGIN_NAME  | PLUGIN_STATUS | PLUGIN_TYPE |
+--------------+---------------+-------------+
| ddl_rewriter | ACTIVE        | AUDIT       |
+--------------+---------------+-------------+
```

As the preceding result shows, `ddl_rewriter`
is implemented as an audit plugin.

If the plugin fails to initialize, check the server error log
for diagnostic messages.

Once installed as just described,
`ddl_rewriter` remains installed until
uninstalled. To remove it, use [`UNINSTALL
PLUGIN`](uninstall-plugin.md "15.7.4.6 UNINSTALL PLUGIN Statement"):

```sql
UNINSTALL PLUGIN ddl_rewriter;
```

If `ddl_rewriter` is installed, you can use the
[`--ddl-rewriter`](ddl-rewriter-options.md#option_mysqld_ddl-rewriter) option for
subsequent server startups to control
`ddl_rewriter` plugin activation. For example,
to prevent the plugin from being enabled at runtime, use this
option:

```ini
[mysqld]
ddl-rewriter=OFF
```
