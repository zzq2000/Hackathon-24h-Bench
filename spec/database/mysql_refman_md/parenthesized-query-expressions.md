### 15.2.11 Parenthesized Query Expressions

```sql
parenthesized_query_expression:
    ( query_expression [order_by_clause] [limit_clause] )
      [order_by_clause]
      [limit_clause]
      [into_clause]

query_expression:
    query_block [set_op query_block [set_op query_block ...]]
      [order_by_clause]
      [limit_clause]
      [into_clause]

query_block:
    SELECT ... | TABLE | VALUES

order_by_clause:
    ORDER BY as for SELECT

limit_clause:
    LIMIT as for SELECT

into_clause:
    INTO as for SELECT

set_op:
    UNION | INTERSECT | EXCEPT
```

MySQL 8.0.22 and higher supports parenthesized query expressions
according to the preceding syntax. At its simplest, a
parenthesized query expression contains a single
[`SELECT`](select.md "15.2.13 SELECT Statement") or other statement returning
a result set and no following optional clauses:

```sql
(SELECT 1);
(SELECT * FROM INFORMATION_SCHEMA.SCHEMATA WHERE SCHEMA_NAME = 'mysql');

TABLE t;

VALUES ROW(2, 3, 4), ROW(1, -2, 3);
```

(Support for the [`TABLE`](table.md "15.2.16 TABLE Statement") and
[`VALUES`](values.md "15.2.19 VALUES Statement") statements is available
beginning with MySQL 8.0.19.)

A parenthesized query expression can also contain queries linked
by one or more set operations such as
[`UNION`](union.md "15.2.18 UNION Clause"), and end with any or all of
the optional clauses:

```sql
mysql> (SELECT 1 AS result UNION SELECT 2);
+--------+
| result |
+--------+
|      1 |
|      2 |
+--------+
mysql> (SELECT 1 AS result UNION SELECT 2) LIMIT 1;
+--------+
| result |
+--------+
|      1 |
+--------+
mysql> (SELECT 1 AS result UNION SELECT 2) LIMIT 1 OFFSET 1;
+--------+
| result |
+--------+
|      2 |
+--------+
mysql> (SELECT 1 AS result UNION SELECT 2)
       ORDER BY result DESC LIMIT 1;
+--------+
| result |
+--------+
|      2 |
+--------+
mysql> (SELECT 1 AS result UNION SELECT 2)
       ORDER BY result DESC LIMIT 1 OFFSET 1;
+--------+
| result |
+--------+
|      1 |
+--------+
mysql> (SELECT 1 AS result UNION SELECT 3 UNION SELECT 2)
       ORDER BY result LIMIT 1 OFFSET 1 INTO @var;
mysql> SELECT @var;
+------+
| @var |
+------+
|    2 |
+------+
```

In addition to `UNION`, the
`INTERSECT` and `EXCEPT` set
operators are available beginning with MySQL 8.0.31.
`INTERSECT` acts before `UNION`
and `EXCEPT`, so that the following two
statements are equivalent:

```sql
SELECT a FROM t1 EXCEPT SELECT b FROM t2 INTERSECT SELECT c FROM t3;

SELECT a FROM t1 EXCEPT (SELECT b FROM t2 INTERSECT SELECT c FROM t3);
```

Parenthesized query expressions are also used as query
expressions, so a query expression, usually composed of query
blocks, may also consist of parenthesized query expressions:

```sql
(TABLE t1 ORDER BY a) UNION (TABLE t2 ORDER BY b) ORDER BY z;
```

Query blocks may have trailing `ORDER BY` and
`LIMIT` clauses, which are applied before the
outer set operation, `ORDER BY`, and
`LIMIT`.

You cannot have a query block with a trailing `ORDER
BY` or `LIMIT` without wrapping it in
parentheses but parentheses may be used for enforcement in various
ways:

- To enforce `LIMIT` on each query block:

  ```sql
  (SELECT 1 LIMIT 1) UNION (VALUES ROW(2) LIMIT 1);

  (VALUES ROW(1), ROW(2) LIMIT 2) EXCEPT (SELECT 2 LIMIT 1);
  ```
- To enforce `LIMIT` on both query blocks and
  the entire query expression:

  ```sql
  (SELECT 1 LIMIT 1) UNION (SELECT 2 LIMIT 1) LIMIT 1;
  ```
- To enforce `LIMIT` on the entire query
  expression (with no parentheses):

  ```sql
  VALUES ROW(1), ROW(2) INTERSECT VALUES ROW(2), ROW(1) LIMIT 1;
  ```
- Hybrid enforcement: `LIMIT` on the first
  query block and on the entire query expression:

  ```sql
  (SELECT 1 LIMIT 1) UNION SELECT 2 LIMIT 1;
  ```

The syntax described in this section is subject to certain
restrictions:

- A trailing `INTO` clause for a query
  expression is not permitted if there is another
  `INTO` clause inside parentheses.
- Prior to MySQL 8.0.31, when `ORDER BY` or
  `LIMIT` occurred within a parenthesized query
  expression and was also applied in the outer query, the result
  was undefined. This is not an issue in MySQL 8.0.31 and later,
  where this is handled in accordance with the SQL standard.

  Prior to MySQL 8.0.31, parenthesized query expressions did not
  permit multiple levels of `ORDER BY` or
  `LIMIT` operations, and statements containing
  these were rejected with
  [`ER_NOT_SUPPORTED_YET`](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/mysql-errors/8.0/en/server-error-reference.html#error_er_not_supported_yet). In MySQL
  8.0.31 and later, this restriction is lifted, and nested
  parenthesized query expressions are permitted. The maximum
  level of nesting supported is 63; this is after any
  simplifications or merges have been performed by the parser.

  An example of such a statement is shown here:

  ```sql
  mysql> (SELECT 'a' UNION SELECT 'b' LIMIT 2) LIMIT 3;
  +---+
  | a |
  +---+
  | a |
  | b |
  +---+
  2 rows in set (0.00 sec)
  ```

  You should be aware that, in MySQL 8.0.31 and later, when
  collapsing parenthesized expression bodies, MySQL follows SQL
  standard semantics, so that a higher outer limit cannot
  override an inner lower one. For example, `(SELECT ...
  LIMIT 5) LIMIT 10` can return no more than five rows.
