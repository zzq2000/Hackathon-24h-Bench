#### 25.6.16.62 The ndbinfo threads Table

The `threads` table provides information about
threads running in the `NDB` kernel.

The `threads` table contains the following
columns:

- `node_id`

  ID of the node where the thread is running
- `thr_no`

  Thread ID (specific to this node)
- `thread_name`

  Thread name (type of thread)
- `thread_description`

  Thread (type) description

##### Notes

Sample output from a 2-node example cluster, including thread
descriptions, is shown here:

```sql
mysql> SELECT * FROM threads;
+---------+--------+-------------+------------------------------------------------------------------+
| node_id | thr_no | thread_name | thread_description                                               |
+---------+--------+-------------+------------------------------------------------------------------+
|       5 |      0 | main        | main thread, schema and distribution handling                    |
|       5 |      1 | rep         | rep thread, asynch replication and proxy block handling          |
|       5 |      2 | ldm         | ldm thread, handling a set of data partitions                    |
|       5 |      3 | recv        | receive thread, performing receive and polling for new receives  |
|       6 |      0 | main        | main thread, schema and distribution handling                    |
|       6 |      1 | rep         | rep thread, asynch replication and proxy block handling          |
|       6 |      2 | ldm         | ldm thread, handling a set of data partitions                    |

NDB 8.0.23 introduces the possibility to set either of the
[`ThreadConfig`](mysql-cluster-ndbd-definition.md#ndbparam-ndbmtd-threadconfig) arguments
`main` or `rep` to 0 while
keeping the other at 1, in which case the thread name is
`main_rep` and its description is `main
and rep thread, schema, distribution, proxy block and asynch
replication handling`. It is also possible beginning
with NDB 8.0.23 to set both `main` and
`rep` to 0, in which case the name of the
resulting thread is shown in this table as
`main_rep_recv`, and its description is
`main, rep and recv thread, schema, distribution, proxy
block and asynch replication handling and handling receive and
polling for new receives`.
