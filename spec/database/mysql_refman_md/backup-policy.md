### 9.3.1 Establishing a Backup Policy

To be useful, backups must be scheduled regularly. A full backup
(a snapshot of the data at a point in time) can be done in MySQL
with several tools. For example,
[MySQL Enterprise Backup](mysql-enterprise-backup.md "32.1 MySQL Enterprise Backup Overview") can perform
a [physical backup](glossary.md#glos_physical_backup "physical backup") of
an entire instance, with optimizations to minimize overhead and
avoid disruption when backing up `InnoDB` data
files; [**mysqldump**](mysqldump.md "6.5.4 mysqldump — A Database Backup Program") provides online
[logical backup](glossary.md#glos_logical_backup "logical backup"). This
discussion uses [**mysqldump**](mysqldump.md "6.5.4 mysqldump — A Database Backup Program").

Assume that we make a full backup of all our
`InnoDB` tables in all databases using the
following command on Sunday at 1 p.m., when load is low:

```terminal
$> mysqldump --all-databases --master-data --single-transaction > backup_sunday_1_PM.sql
```

The resulting `.sql` file produced by
[**mysqldump**](mysqldump.md "6.5.4 mysqldump — A Database Backup Program") contains a set of SQL
[`INSERT`](insert.md "15.2.7 INSERT Statement") statements that can be
used to reload the dumped tables at a later time.

This backup operation acquires a global read lock on all tables
at the beginning of the dump (using [`FLUSH
TABLES WITH READ LOCK`](flush.md#flush-tables-with-read-lock)). As soon as this lock has been
acquired, the binary log coordinates are read and the lock is
released. If long updating statements are running when the
[`FLUSH`](flush.md "15.7.8.3 FLUSH Statement") statement is issued, the
backup operation may stall until those statements finish. After
that, the dump becomes lock-free and does not disturb reads and
writes on the tables.

It was assumed earlier that the tables to back up are
`InnoDB` tables, so
[`--single-transaction`](mysqldump.md#option_mysqldump_single-transaction) uses a
consistent read and guarantees that data seen by
[**mysqldump**](mysqldump.md "6.5.4 mysqldump — A Database Backup Program") does not change. (Changes made by
other clients to `InnoDB` tables are not seen
by the [**mysqldump**](mysqldump.md "6.5.4 mysqldump — A Database Backup Program") process.) If the backup
operation includes nontransactional tables, consistency requires
that they do not change during the backup. For example, for the
`MyISAM` tables in the `mysql`
database, there must be no administrative changes to MySQL
accounts during the backup.

Full backups are necessary, but it is not always convenient to
create them. They produce large backup files and take time to
generate. They are not optimal in the sense that each successive
full backup includes all data, even that part that has not
changed since the previous full backup. It is more efficient to
make an initial full backup, and then to make incremental
backups. The incremental backups are smaller and take less time
to produce. The tradeoff is that, at recovery time, you cannot
restore your data just by reloading the full backup. You must
also process the incremental backups to recover the incremental
changes.

To make incremental backups, we need to save the incremental
changes. In MySQL, these changes are represented in the binary
log, so the MySQL server should always be started with the
[`--log-bin`](replication-options-binary-log.md#option_mysqld_log-bin) option to enable that
log. With binary logging enabled, the server writes each data
change into a file while it updates data. Looking at the data
directory of a MySQL server that has been running for some days,
we find these MySQL binary log files:

```simple
-rw-rw---- 1 guilhem  guilhem   1277324 Nov 10 23:59 gbichot2-bin.000001
-rw-rw---- 1 guilhem  guilhem         4 Nov 10 23:59 gbichot2-bin.000002
-rw-rw---- 1 guilhem  guilhem        79 Nov 11 11:06 gbichot2-bin.000003
-rw-rw---- 1 guilhem  guilhem       508 Nov 11 11:08 gbichot2-bin.000004
-rw-rw---- 1 guilhem  guilhem 220047446 Nov 12 16:47 gbichot2-bin.000005
-rw-rw---- 1 guilhem  guilhem    998412 Nov 14 10:08 gbichot2-bin.000006
-rw-rw---- 1 guilhem  guilhem       361 Nov 14 10:07 gbichot2-bin.index
```

Each time it restarts, the MySQL server creates a new binary log
file using the next number in the sequence. While the server is
running, you can also tell it to close the current binary log
file and begin a new one manually by issuing a
[`FLUSH LOGS`](flush.md#flush-logs) SQL statement or with
a [**mysqladmin flush-logs**](mysqladmin.md "6.5.2 mysqladmin — A MySQL Server Administration Program") command.
[**mysqldump**](mysqldump.md "6.5.4 mysqldump — A Database Backup Program") also has an option to flush the
logs. The `.index` file in the data directory
contains the list of all MySQL binary logs in the directory.

The MySQL binary logs are important for recovery because they
form the set of incremental backups. If you make sure to flush
the logs when you make your full backup, the binary log files
created afterward contain all the data changes made since the
backup. Let's modify the previous [**mysqldump**](mysqldump.md "6.5.4 mysqldump — A Database Backup Program")
command a bit so that it flushes the MySQL binary logs at the
moment of the full backup, and so that the dump file contains
the name of the new current binary log:

```terminal
$> mysqldump --single-transaction --flush-logs --master-data=2 \
         --all-databases > backup_sunday_1_PM.sql
```

After executing this command, the data directory contains a new
binary log file, `gbichot2-bin.000007`,
because the [`--flush-logs`](mysqldump.md#option_mysqldump_flush-logs)
option causes the server to flush its logs. The
[`--master-data`](mysqldump.md#option_mysqldump_master-data) option causes
[**mysqldump**](mysqldump.md "6.5.4 mysqldump — A Database Backup Program") to write binary log information to
its output, so the resulting `.sql` dump file
includes these lines:

```simple
-- Position to start replication or point-in-time recovery from
-- CHANGE MASTER TO MASTER_LOG_FILE='gbichot2-bin.000007',MASTER_LOG_POS=4;
```

Because the [**mysqldump**](mysqldump.md "6.5.4 mysqldump — A Database Backup Program") command made a full
backup, those lines mean two things:

- The dump file contains all changes made before any changes
  written to the `gbichot2-bin.000007`
  binary log file or higher.
- All data changes logged after the backup are not present in
  the dump file, but are present in the
  `gbichot2-bin.000007` binary log file or
  higher.

On Monday at 1 p.m., we can create an incremental backup by
flushing the logs to begin a new binary log file. For example,
executing a [**mysqladmin flush-logs**](mysqladmin.md "6.5.2 mysqladmin — A MySQL Server Administration Program") command
creates `gbichot2-bin.000008`. All changes
between the Sunday 1 p.m. full backup and Monday 1 p.m. are
written in `gbichot2-bin.000007`. This
incremental backup is important, so it is a good idea to copy it
to a safe place. (For example, back it up on tape or DVD, or
copy it to another machine.) On Tuesday at 1 p.m., execute
another [**mysqladmin flush-logs**](mysqladmin.md "6.5.2 mysqladmin — A MySQL Server Administration Program") command. All
changes between Monday 1 p.m. and Tuesday 1 p.m. are written in
`gbichot2-bin.000008` (which also should be
copied somewhere safe).

The MySQL binary logs take up disk space. To free up space,
purge them from time to time. One way to do this is by deleting
the binary logs that are no longer needed, such as when we make
a full backup:

```terminal
$> mysqldump --single-transaction --flush-logs --master-data=2 \
         --all-databases --delete-master-logs > backup_sunday_1_PM.sql
```

Note

Deleting the MySQL binary logs with [**mysqldump
--delete-master-logs**](mysqldump.md "6.5.4 mysqldump — A Database Backup Program") can be dangerous if your server
is a replication source server, because replicas might not yet
fully have processed the contents of the binary log. The
description for the [`PURGE BINARY
LOGS`](purge-binary-logs.md "15.4.1.1 PURGE BINARY LOGS Statement") statement explains what should be verified
before deleting the MySQL binary logs. See
[Section 15.4.1.1, “PURGE BINARY LOGS Statement”](purge-binary-logs.md "15.4.1.1 PURGE BINARY LOGS Statement").
