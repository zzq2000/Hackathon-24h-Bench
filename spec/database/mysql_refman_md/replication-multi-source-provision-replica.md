#### 19.1.5.2 Provisioning a Multi-Source Replica for GTID-Based Replication

If the sources in the multi-source replication topology have
existing data, it can save time to provision the replica with the
relevant data before starting replication. In a multi-source
replication topology, cloning or copying of the data directory
cannot be used to provision the replica with data from all of the
sources, and you might also want to replicate only specific
databases from each source. The best strategy for provisioning
such a replica is therefore to use [**mysqldump**](mysqldump.md "6.5.4 mysqldump — A Database Backup Program") to
create an appropriate dump file on each source, then use the
[**mysql**](mysql.md "6.5.1 mysql — The MySQL Command-Line Client") client to import the dump file on the
replica.

If you are using GTID-based replication, you need to pay attention
to the `SET @@GLOBAL.gtid_purged` statement that
[**mysqldump**](mysqldump.md "6.5.4 mysqldump — A Database Backup Program") places in the dump output. This
statement transfers the GTIDs for the transactions executed on the
source to the replica, and the replica requires this information.
However, for any case more complex than provisioning one new,
empty replica from one source, you need to check what effect the
statement has in the version of MySQL used by the replica, and
handle the statement accordingly. The following guidance
summarizes suitable actions, but for more details, see the
[**mysqldump**](mysqldump.md "6.5.4 mysqldump — A Database Backup Program") documentation.

The behavior of the `SET @@GLOBAL.gtid_purged`
statement written by [**mysqldump**](mysqldump.md "6.5.4 mysqldump — A Database Backup Program") is different in
releases from MySQL 8.0 compared to MySQL 5.6 and 5.7. In MySQL
5.6 and 5.7, the statement replaces the value of
[`gtid_purged`](replication-options-gtids.md#sysvar_gtid_purged) on the replica, and
also in those releases that value can only be changed when the
replica's record of transactions with GTIDs (the
[`gtid_executed`](replication-options-gtids.md#sysvar_gtid_executed) set) is empty. In a
multi-source replication topology, you must therefore remove the
`SET @@GLOBAL.gtid_purged` statement from the
dump output before replaying the dump files, because you cannot
apply a second or subsequent dump file including this statement.
Also note that for MySQL 5.6 and 5.7, this limitation means all
the dump files from the sources must be applied in a single
operation on a replica with an empty
[`gtid_executed`](replication-options-gtids.md#sysvar_gtid_executed) set. You can clear
a replica's GTID execution history by issuing
[`RESET MASTER`](reset-master.md "15.4.1.2 RESET MASTER Statement") on the replica, but if
you have other, wanted transactions with GTIDs on the replica,
choose an alternative method of provisioning from those described
in [Section 19.1.3.5, “Using GTIDs for Failover and Scaleout”](replication-gtids-failover.md "19.1.3.5 Using GTIDs for Failover and Scaleout").

From MySQL 8.0, the `SET @@GLOBAL.gtid_purged`
statement adds the GTID set from the dump file to the existing
[`gtid_purged`](replication-options-gtids.md#sysvar_gtid_purged) set on the replica.
The statement can therefore potentially be left in the dump output
when you replay the dump files on the replica, and the dump files
can be replayed at different times. However, it is important to
note that the value that is included by
[**mysqldump**](mysqldump.md "6.5.4 mysqldump — A Database Backup Program") for the `SET
@@GLOBAL.gtid_purged` statement includes the GTIDs of all
transactions in the [`gtid_executed`](replication-options-gtids.md#sysvar_gtid_executed)
set on the source, even those that changed suppressed parts of the
database, or other databases on the server that were not included
in a partial dump. If you replay a second or subsequent dump file
on the replica that contains any of the same GTIDs (for example,
another partial dump from the same source, or a dump from another
source that has overlapping transactions), any `SET
@@GLOBAL.gtid_purged` statement in the second dump file
fails, and must therefore be removed from the dump output.

For sources from MySQL 8.0.17, as an alternative to removing the
`SET @@GLOBAL.gtid_purged` statement, you may set
[**mysqldump**](mysqldump.md "6.5.4 mysqldump — A Database Backup Program")'s
`--set-gtid-purged` option to
`COMMENTED` to include the statement but
commented out, so that it is not actioned when you load the dump
file. If you are provisioning the replica with two partial dumps
from the same source, and the GTID set in the second dump is the
same as the first (so no new transactions have been executed on
the source in between the dumps), you can set
[**mysqldump**](mysqldump.md "6.5.4 mysqldump — A Database Backup Program")'s
`--set-gtid-purged` option to
`OFF` when you output the second dump file, to
omit the statement.

In the following provisioning example, we assume that the
`SET @@GLOBAL.gtid_purged` statement cannot be
left in the dump output, and must be removed from the files and
handled manually. We also assume that there are no wanted
transactions with GTIDs on the replica before provisioning starts.

1. To create dump files for a database named
   `db1` on `source1` and a
   database named `db2` on
   `source2`, run [**mysqldump**](mysqldump.md "6.5.4 mysqldump — A Database Backup Program")
   for `source1` as follows:

   ```terminal
   mysqldump -u<user> -p<password> --single-transaction --triggers --routines --set-gtid-purged=ON --databases db1 > dumpM1.sql
   ```

   Then run [**mysqldump**](mysqldump.md "6.5.4 mysqldump — A Database Backup Program") for
   `source2` as follows:

   ```terminal
   mysqldump -u<user> -p<password> --single-transaction --triggers --routines --set-gtid-purged=ON --databases db2 > dumpM2.sql
   ```
2. Record the [`gtid_purged`](replication-options-gtids.md#sysvar_gtid_purged) value
   that [**mysqldump**](mysqldump.md "6.5.4 mysqldump — A Database Backup Program") added to each of the dump
   files. For example, for dump files created on MySQL 5.6 or
   5.7, you can extract the value like this:

   ```none
   cat dumpM1.sql | grep GTID_PURGED | cut -f2 -d'=' | cut -f2 -d$'\''
   cat dumpM2.sql | grep GTID_PURGED | cut -f2 -d'=' | cut -f2 -d$'\''
   ```

   From MySQL 8.0, where the format has changed, you can extract
   the value like this:

   ```none
   cat dumpM1.sql | grep GTID_PURGED | perl -p0 -e 's#/\*.*?\*/##sg' | cut -f2 -d'=' | cut -f2 -d$'\''
   cat dumpM2.sql | grep GTID_PURGED | perl -p0 -e 's#/\*.*?\*/##sg' | cut -f2 -d'=' | cut -f2 -d$'\''
   ```

   The result in each case should be a GTID set, for example:

   ```none
   source1:   2174B383-5441-11E8-B90A-C80AA9429562:1-1029
   source2:   224DA167-0C0C-11E8-8442-00059A3C7B00:1-2695
   ```
3. Remove the line from each dump file that contains the
   `SET @@GLOBAL.gtid_purged` statement. For
   example:

   ```simple
   sed '/GTID_PURGED/d' dumpM1.sql > dumpM1_nopurge.sql
   sed '/GTID_PURGED/d' dumpM2.sql > dumpM2_nopurge.sql
   ```
4. Use the [**mysql**](mysql.md "6.5.1 mysql — The MySQL Command-Line Client") client to import each edited
   dump file into the replica. For example:

   ```simple
   mysql -u<user> -p<password> < dumpM1_nopurge.sql
   mysql -u<user> -p<password> < dumpM2_nopurge.sql
   ```
5. On the replica, issue [`RESET
   MASTER`](reset-master.md "15.4.1.2 RESET MASTER Statement") to clear the GTID execution history
   (assuming, as explained above, that all the dump files have
   been imported and that there are no wanted transactions with
   GTIDs on the replica). Then issue a `SET
   @@GLOBAL.gtid_purged` statement to set the
   [`gtid_purged`](replication-options-gtids.md#sysvar_gtid_purged) value to the
   union of all the GTID sets from all the dump files, as you
   recorded in Step 2. For example:

   ```sql
   mysql> RESET MASTER;
   mysql> SET @@GLOBAL.gtid_purged = "2174B383-5441-11E8-B90A-C80AA9429562:1-1029, 224DA167-0C0C-11E8-8442-00059A3C7B00:1-2695";
   ```

   If there are, or might be, overlapping transactions between
   the GTID sets in the dump files, you can use the stored
   functions described in
   [Section 19.1.3.8, “Stored Function Examples to Manipulate GTIDs”](replication-gtids-functions.md "19.1.3.8 Stored Function Examples to Manipulate GTIDs") to check this
   beforehand and to calculate the union of all the GTID sets.
