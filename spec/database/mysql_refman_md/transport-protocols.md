### 6.2.7 Connection Transport Protocols

For programs that use the MySQL client library (for example,
[**mysql**](mysql.md "6.5.1 mysql — The MySQL Command-Line Client") and [**mysqldump**](mysqldump.md "6.5.4 mysqldump — A Database Backup Program")), MySQL
supports connections to the server based on several transport
protocols: TCP/IP, Unix socket file, named pipe, and shared
memory. This section describes how to select these protocols, and
how they are similar and different.

- [Transport Protocol Selection](transport-protocols.md#transport-protocol-selection "Transport Protocol Selection")
- [Transport Support for Local and Remote Connections](transport-protocols.md#transport-protocol-local-remote "Transport Support for Local and Remote Connections")
- [Interpretation of localhost](transport-protocols.md#transport-protocol-localhost "Interpretation of localhost")
- [Encryption and Security Characteristics](transport-protocols.md#transport-protocol-encryption "Encryption and Security Characteristics")
- [Connection Compression](transport-protocols.md#transport-protocol-compression "Connection Compression")

#### Transport Protocol Selection

For a given connection, if the transport protocol is not
specified explicitly, it is determined implicitly. For example,
connections to `localhost` result in a socket
file connection on Unix and Unix-like systems, and a TCP/IP
connection to `127.0.0.1` otherwise. For
additional information, see [Section 6.2.4, “Connecting to the MySQL Server Using Command Options”](connecting.md "6.2.4 Connecting to the MySQL Server Using Command Options").

To specify the protocol explicitly, use the
[`--protocol`](connection-options.md#option_general_protocol) command option. The
following table shows the permissible values for
[`--protocol`](connection-options.md#option_general_protocol) and indicates the
applicable platforms for each value. The values are not
case-sensitive.

| [`--protocol`](connection-options.md#option_general_protocol) Value | Transport Protocol Used | Applicable Platforms |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `TCP` | TCP/IP | All |
| `SOCKET` | Unix socket file | Unix and Unix-like systems |
| `PIPE` | Named pipe | Windows |
| `MEMORY` | Shared memory | Windows |

#### Transport Support for Local and Remote Connections

TCP/IP transport supports connections to local or remote MySQL
servers.

Socket-file, named-pipe, and shared-memory transports support
connections only to local MySQL servers. (Named-pipe transport
does allow for remote connections, but this capability is not
implemented in MySQL.)

#### Interpretation of localhost

If the transport protocol is not specified explicitly,
`localhost` is interpreted as follows:

- On Unix and Unix-like systems, a connection to
  `localhost` results in a socket-file
  connection.
- Otherwise, a connection to `localhost`
  results in a TCP/IP connection to
  `127.0.0.1`.

If the transport protocol is specified explicitly,
`localhost` is interpreted with respect to that
protocol. For example, with
[`--protocol=TCP`](connection-options.md#option_general_protocol), a connection to
`localhost` results in a TCP/IP connection to
`127.0.0.1` on all platforms.

#### Encryption and Security Characteristics

TCP/IP and socket-file transports are subject to TLS/SSL
encryption, using the options described in
[Command Options for Encrypted Connections](connection-options.md#encrypted-connection-options "Command Options for Encrypted Connections"). Named-pipe and
shared-memory transports are not subject to TLS/SSL encryption.

A connection is secure by default if made over a transport
protocol that is secure by default. Otherwise, for protocols
that are subject to TLS/SSL encryption, a connection may be made
secure using encryption:

- TCP/IP connections are not secure by default, but can be
  encrypted to make them secure.
- Socket-file connections are secure by default. They can also
  be encrypted, but encrypting a socket-file connection makes
  it no more secure and increases CPU load.
- Named-pipe connections are not secure by default, and are
  not subject to encryption to make them secure. However, the
  [`named_pipe_full_access_group`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_named_pipe_full_access_group)
  system variable is available to control which MySQL users
  are permitted to use named-pipe connections.
- Shared-memory connections are secure by default.

If the [`require_secure_transport`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_require_secure_transport)
system variable is enabled, the server permits only connections
that use some form of secure transport. Per the preceding
remarks, connections that use TCP/IP encrypted using TLS/SSL, a
socket file, or shared memory are secure connections. TCP/IP
connections not encrypted using TLS/SSL and named-pipe
connections are not secure.

#### Connection Compression

All transport protocols are subject to use of compression on the
traffic between the client and server. If both compression and
encryption are used for a given connection, compression occurs
before encryption. For more information, see
[Section 6.2.8, “Connection Compression Control”](connection-compression-control.md "6.2.8 Connection Compression Control").
