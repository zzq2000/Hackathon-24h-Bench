#### 29.12.6.2 The events\_statements\_history Table

The [`events_statements_history`](performance-schema-events-statements-history-table.md "29.12.6.2 The events_statements_history Table")
table contains the *`N`* most recent
statement events that have ended per thread. Statement events
are not added to the table until they have ended. When the
table contains the maximum number of rows for a given thread,
the oldest thread row is discarded when a new row for that
thread is added. When a thread ends, all its rows are
discarded.

The Performance Schema autosizes the value of
*`N`* during server startup. To set the
number of rows per thread explicitly, set the
[`performance_schema_events_statements_history_size`](performance-schema-system-variables.md#sysvar_performance_schema_events_statements_history_size)
system variable at server startup.

The [`events_statements_history`](performance-schema-events-statements-history-table.md "29.12.6.2 The events_statements_history Table")
table has the same columns and indexing as
[`events_statements_current`](performance-schema-events-statements-current-table.md "29.12.6.1 The events_statements_current Table"). See
[Section 29.12.6.1, “The events\_statements\_current Table”](performance-schema-events-statements-current-table.md "29.12.6.1 The events_statements_current Table").

[`TRUNCATE TABLE`](truncate-table.md "15.1.37 TRUNCATE TABLE Statement") is permitted for
the [`events_statements_history`](performance-schema-events-statements-history-table.md "29.12.6.2 The events_statements_history Table")
table. It removes the rows.

For more information about the relationship between the three
`events_statements_xxx`
event tables, see
[Section 29.9, “Performance Schema Tables for Current and Historical Events”](performance-schema-event-tables.md "29.9 Performance Schema Tables for Current and Historical Events").

For information about configuring whether to collect statement
events, see
[Section 29.12.6, “Performance Schema Statement Event Tables”](performance-schema-statement-tables.md "29.12.6 Performance Schema Statement Event Tables").
