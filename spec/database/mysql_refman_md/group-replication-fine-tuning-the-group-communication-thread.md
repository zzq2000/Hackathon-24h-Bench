### 20.7.1 Fine Tuning the Group Communication Thread

The group communication thread (GCT) runs in a loop while the
Group Replication plugin is loaded. The GCT receives messages from
the group and from the plugin, handles quorum and failure
detection related tasks, sends out some keep alive messages and
also handles the incoming and outgoing transactions from/to the
server/group. The GCT waits for incoming messages in a queue. When
there are no messages, the GCT waits. By configuring this wait to
be a little longer (doing an active wait) before actually going to
sleep can prove to be beneficial in some cases. This is because
the alternative is for the operating system to switch out the GCT
from the processor and do a context switch.

To force the GCT to do an active wait, use the
[`group_replication_poll_spin_loops`](group-replication-system-variables.md#sysvar_group_replication_poll_spin_loops)
option, which makes the GCT loop, doing nothing relevant for the
configured number of loops, before actually polling the queue for
the next message.

For example:

```sql
mysql> SET GLOBAL group_replication_poll_spin_loops= 10000;
```
