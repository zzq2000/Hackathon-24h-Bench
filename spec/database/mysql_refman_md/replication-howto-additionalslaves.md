#### 19.1.2.8 Adding Replicas to a Replication Environment

You can add another replica to an existing replication
configuration without stopping the source server. To do this,
you can set up the new replica by copying the data directory of
an existing replica, and giving the new replica a different
server ID (which is user-specified) and server UUID (which is
generated at startup).

Note

If the replication source server or existing replica that you
are copying to create the new replica has any scheduled
events, ensure that these are disabled on the new replica
before you start it. If an event runs on the new replica that
has already run on the source, the duplicated operation causes
an error. The Event Scheduler is controlled by the
[`event_scheduler`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_event_scheduler) system
variable, which defaults to `ON` from MySQL
8.0, so events that are active on the original server run by
default when the new replica starts up. To stop all events
from running on the new replica, set the
[`event_scheduler`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_event_scheduler) system
variable to `OFF` or
`DISABLED` on the new replica. Alternatively,
you can use the [`ALTER EVENT`](alter-event.md "15.1.3 ALTER EVENT Statement")
statement to set individual events to
`DISABLE` or `DISABLE ON
SLAVE` to prevent them from running on the new
replica. You can list the events on a server using the
[`SHOW`](show.md "15.7.7 SHOW Statements") statement or the
Information Schema [`EVENTS`](information-schema-events-table.md "28.3.14 The INFORMATION_SCHEMA EVENTS Table") table.
For more information, see
[Section 19.5.1.16, “Replication of Invoked Features”](replication-features-invoked.md "19.5.1.16 Replication of Invoked Features").

As an alternative to creating a new replica in this way, MySQL
Server's clone plugin can be used to transfer all the data and
replication settings from an existing replica to a clone. For
instructions to use this method, see
[Section 7.6.7.7, “Cloning for Replication”](clone-plugin-replication.md "7.6.7.7 Cloning for Replication").

To duplicate an existing replica without cloning, follow these
steps:

1. Stop the existing replica and record the replica status
   information, particularly the source binary log file and
   relay log file positions. You can view the replica status
   either in the Performance Schema replication tables (see
   [Section 29.12.11, “Performance Schema Replication Tables”](performance-schema-replication-tables.md "29.12.11 Performance Schema Replication Tables")), or
   by issuing [`SHOW REPLICA
   STATUS`](show-replica-status.md "15.7.7.35 SHOW REPLICA STATUS Statement") as follows:

   ```sql
   mysql> STOP SLAVE;
   mysql> SHOW SLAVE STATUS\G
   Or from MySQL 8.0.22:
   mysql> STOP REPLICA;
   mysql> SHOW REPLICA STATUS\G
   ```
2. Shut down the existing replica:

   ```terminal
   $> mysqladmin shutdown
   ```
3. Copy the data directory from the existing replica to the new
   replica, including the log files and relay log files. You
   can do this by creating an archive using
   **tar** or `WinZip`, or by
   performing a direct copy using a tool such as
   **cp** or **rsync**.

   Important

   - Before copying, verify that all the files relating to
     the existing replica actually are stored in the data
     directory. For example, the `InnoDB`
     system tablespace, undo tablespace, and redo log might
     be stored in an alternative location.
     `InnoDB` tablespace files and
     file-per-table tablespaces might have been created in
     other directories. The binary logs and relay logs for
     the replica might be in their own directories outside
     the data directory. Check through the system variables
     that are set for the existing replica and look for any
     alternative paths that have been specified. If you
     find any, copy these directories over as well.
   - During copying, if files have been used for the
     replication metadata repositories (see
     [Section 19.2.4, “Relay Log and Replication Metadata Repositories”](replica-logs.md "19.2.4 Relay Log and Replication Metadata Repositories")), ensure that you also
     copy these files from the existing replica to the new
     replica. If tables have been used for the
     repositories, which is the default from MySQL 8.0, the
     tables are in the data directory.
   - After copying, delete the
     `auto.cnf` file from the copy of
     the data directory on the new replica, so that the new
     replica is started with a different generated server
     UUID. The server UUID must be unique.

   A common problem that is encountered when adding new
   replicas is that the new replica fails with a series of
   warning and error messages like these:

   ```none
   071118 16:44:10 [Warning] Neither --relay-log nor --relay-log-index were used; so
   replication may break when this MySQL server acts as a replica and has his hostname
   changed!! Please use '--relay-log=new_replica_hostname-relay-bin' to avoid this problem.
   071118 16:44:10 [ERROR] Failed to open the relay log './old_replica_hostname-relay-bin.003525'
   (relay_log_pos 22940879)
   071118 16:44:10 [ERROR] Could not find target log during relay log initialization
   071118 16:44:10 [ERROR] Failed to initialize the master info structure
   ```

   This situation can occur if the
   [`relay_log`](replication-options-replica.md#sysvar_relay_log) system variable
   is not specified, as the relay log files contain the host
   name as part of their file names. This is also true of the
   relay log index file if the
   [`relay_log_index`](replication-options-replica.md#sysvar_relay_log_index) system
   variable is not used. For more information about these
   variables, see [Section 19.1.6, “Replication and Binary Logging Options and Variables”](replication-options.md "19.1.6 Replication and Binary Logging Options and Variables").

   To avoid this problem, use the same value for
   [`relay_log`](replication-options-replica.md#sysvar_relay_log) on the new
   replica that was used on the existing replica. If this
   option was not set explicitly on the existing replica, use
   `existing_replica_hostname-relay-bin`.
   If this is not possible, copy the existing replica's relay
   log index file to the new replica and set the
   [`relay_log_index`](replication-options-replica.md#sysvar_relay_log_index) system
   variable on the new replica to match what was used on the
   existing replica. If this option was not set explicitly on
   the existing replica, use
   `existing_replica_hostname-relay-bin.index`.
   Alternatively, if you have already tried to start the new
   replica after following the remaining steps in this section
   and have encountered errors like those described previously,
   then perform the following steps:

   1. If you have not already done so, issue
      [`STOP REPLICA`](stop-replica.md "15.4.2.8 STOP REPLICA Statement") on the new
      replica.

      If you have already started the existing replica again,
      issue [`STOP REPLICA`](stop-replica.md "15.4.2.8 STOP REPLICA Statement") on the
      existing replica as well.
   2. Copy the contents of the existing replica's relay log
      index file into the new replica's relay log index file,
      making sure to overwrite any content already in the
      file.
   3. Proceed with the remaining steps in this section.
4. When copying is complete, restart the existing replica.
5. On the new replica, edit the configuration and give the new
   replica a unique server ID (using the
   [`server_id`](replication-options.md#sysvar_server_id) system variable)
   that is not used by the source or any of the existing
   replicas.
6. Start the new replica server, ensuring that replication does
   not start yet by specifying the
   [`--skip-slave-start`](replication-options-replica.md#option_mysqld_skip-slave-start) option, or
   from MySQL 8.0.24, the
   [`skip_slave_start`](replication-options-replica.md#sysvar_skip_slave_start) system
   variable. Use the Performance Schema replication tables or
   issue [`SHOW REPLICA STATUS`](show-replica-status.md "15.7.7.35 SHOW REPLICA STATUS Statement") to
   confirm that the new replica has the correct settings when
   compared with the existing replica. Also display the server
   ID and server UUID and verify that these are correct and
   unique for the new replica.
7. Start the replica threads by issuing a
   [`START REPLICA`](start-replica.md "15.4.2.6 START REPLICA Statement") statement. The
   new replica now uses the information in its connection
   metadata repository to start the replication process.
