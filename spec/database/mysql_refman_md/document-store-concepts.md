## 22.2 Document Store Concepts

This section explains the concepts introduced as part of using
MySQL as a document store.

- [JSON Document](document-store-concepts.md#document-store-concepts-json-document "JSON Document")
- [Collection](document-store-concepts.md#document-store-concepts-collection "Collection")
- [CRUD Operations](document-store-concepts.md#document-store-concepts-crud-operation "CRUD Operations")

### JSON Document

A JSON document is a data structure composed of key-value pairs
and is the fundamental structure for using MySQL as document
store. For example, the world\_x schema (installed later in this
chapter) contains this document:

```json
{
    "GNP": 4834,
    "_id": "00005de917d80000000000000023",
    "Code": "BWA",
    "Name": "Botswana",
    "IndepYear": 1966,
    "geography": {
        "Region": "Southern Africa",
        "Continent": "Africa",
        "SurfaceArea": 581730
    },
    "government": {
        "HeadOfState": "Festus G. Mogae",
        "GovernmentForm": "Republic"
    },
    "demographics": {
        "Population": 1622000,
        "LifeExpectancy": 39.29999923706055
    }
}
```

This document shows that the values of keys can be simple data
types, such as integers or strings, but can also contain other
documents, arrays, and lists of documents. For example, the
`geography` key's value consists of multiple
key-value pairs. A JSON document is represented internally using
the MySQL binary JSON object, through the
[`JSON`](json.md "13.5 The JSON Data Type") MySQL datatype.

The most important differences between a document and the tables
known from traditional relational databases are that the
structure of a document does not have to be defined in advance,
and a collection can contain multiple documents with different
structures. Relational tables on the other hand require that
their structure be defined, and all rows in the table must
contain the same columns.

### Collection

A collection is a container that is used to store JSON documents
in a MySQL database. Applications usually run operations against
a collection of documents, for example to find a specific
document.

### CRUD Operations

The four basic operations that can be issued against a
collection are Create, Read, Update and Delete (CRUD). In terms
of MySQL this means:

- Create a new document (insertion or addition)
- Read one or more documents (queries)
- Update one or more documents
- Delete one or more documents
