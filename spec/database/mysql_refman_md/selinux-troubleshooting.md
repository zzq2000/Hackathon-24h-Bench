### 8.7.6 Troubleshooting SELinux

Troubleshooting SELinux typically involves placing SELinux into
permissive mode, rerunning problematic operations, checking for
access denial messages in the SELinux audit log, and placing
SELinux back into enforcing mode after problems are resolved.

To avoid placing the entire system into permissive mode using
**setenforce**, you can permit only the MySQL
service to run permissively by placing its SELinux domain
(`mysqld_t`) into permissive mode using the
**semanage** command:

```terminal
semanage permissive -a mysqld_t
```

When you are finished troubleshooting, use this command to place
the `mysqld_t` domain back into enforcing mode:

```terminal
semanage permissive -d mysqld_t
```

SELinux writes logs for denied operations to
`/var/log/audit/audit.log`. You can check for
denials by searching for “denied” messages.

```simple
grep "denied" /var/log/audit/audit.log
```

The following sections describes a few common areas where
SELinux-related issues may be encountered.

#### File Contexts

If a MySQL directory or file has an incorrect SELinux context,
access may be denied. This issue can occur if MySQL is
configured to read from or write to a non-default directory or
file. For example, if you configure MySQL to use a non-default
data directory, the directory may not have the expected SELinux
context.

Attempting to start the MySQL service on a non-default data
directory with an invalid SELinux context causes the following
startup failure.

```terminal
$> systemctl start mysql.service
Job for mysqld.service failed because the control process exited with error code.
See "systemctl status mysqld.service" and "journalctl -xe" for details.
```

In this case, a “denial” message is logged to
`/var/log/audit/audit.log`:

```terminal
$> grep "denied" /var/log/audit/audit.log
type=AVC msg=audit(1587133719.786:194): avc:  denied  { write } for  pid=7133 comm="mysqld"
name="mysql" dev="dm-0" ino=51347078 scontext=system_u:system_r:mysqld_t:s0
tcontext=unconfined_u:object_r:default_t:s0 tclass=dir permissive=0
```

For information about setting the proper SELinux context for
MySQL directories and files, see
[Section 8.7.4, “SELinux File Context”](selinux-file-context.md "8.7.4 SELinux File Context").

#### Port Access

SELinux expects services such as MySQL Server to use specific
ports. Changing ports without updating the SELinux policies may
cause a service failure.

The `mysqld_port_t` port type defines the ports
that the MySQL listens on. If you configure the MySQL Server to
use a non-default port, such as port 3307, and do not update the
policy to reflect the change, the MySQL service fails to start:

```terminal
$> systemctl start mysqld.service
Job for mysqld.service failed because the control process exited with error code.
See "systemctl status mysqld.service" and "journalctl -xe" for details.
```

In this case, a denial message is logged to
`/var/log/audit/audit.log`:

```terminal
$> grep "denied" /var/log/audit/audit.log
type=AVC msg=audit(1587134375.845:198): avc:  denied  { name_bind } for  pid=7340
comm="mysqld" src=3307 scontext=system_u:system_r:mysqld_t:s0
tcontext=system_u:object_r:unreserved_port_t:s0 tclass=tcp_socket permissive=0
```

For information about setting the proper SELinux port context
for MySQL, see [Section 8.7.5, “SELinux TCP Port Context”](selinux-context-tcp-port.md "8.7.5 SELinux TCP Port Context").
Similar port access issues can occur when enabling MySQL
features that use ports that are not defined with the required
context. For more information, see
[Section 8.7.5.2, “Setting the TCP Port Context for MySQL Features”](selinux-context-mysql-feature-ports.md "8.7.5.2 Setting the TCP Port Context for MySQL Features").

#### Application Changes

SELinux may not be aware of application changes. For example, a
new release, an application extension, or a new feature may
access system resources in a way that is not permitted by
SELinux, resulting in access denials. In such cases, you can use
the **audit2allow** utility to create custom
policies to permit access where it is required. The typical
method for creating custom policies is to change the SELinux
mode to permissive, identify access denial messages in the
SELinux audit log, and use the **audit2allow**
utility to create custom policies to permit access.

For information about using the **audit2allow**
utility, refer to your distribution's SELinux documentation.

If you encounter access issues for MySQL that you believe should
be handled by standard MySQL SELinux policy modules, please open
a bug report in your distribution's bug tracking system.
