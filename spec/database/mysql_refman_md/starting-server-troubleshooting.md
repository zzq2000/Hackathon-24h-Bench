#### 2.9.2.1 Troubleshooting Problems Starting the MySQL Server

This section provides troubleshooting suggestions for problems
starting the server. For additional suggestions for Windows
systems, see [Section 2.3.5, “Troubleshooting a Microsoft Windows MySQL Server Installation”](windows-troubleshooting.md "2.3.5 Troubleshooting a Microsoft Windows MySQL Server Installation").

If you have problems starting the server, here are some things
to try:

- Check the [error log](glossary.md#glos_error_log "error log") to
  see why the server does not start. Log files are located in
  the [data
  directory](glossary.md#glos_data_directory "data directory") (typically `C:\Program
  Files\MySQL\MySQL Server 8.0\data` on
  Windows, `/usr/local/mysql/data` for a
  Unix/Linux binary distribution, and
  `/usr/local/var` for a Unix/Linux source
  distribution). Look in the data directory for files with
  names of the form
  `host_name.err`
  and
  `host_name.log`,
  where *`host_name`* is the name of
  your server host. Then examine the last few lines of these
  files. Use `tail` to display them:

  ```terminal
  $> tail host_name.err
  $> tail host_name.log
  ```
- Specify any special options needed by the storage engines
  you are using. You can create a `my.cnf`
  file and specify startup options for the engines that you
  plan to use. If you are going to use storage engines that
  support transactional tables (`InnoDB`,
  [`NDB`](mysql-cluster.md "Chapter 25 MySQL NDB Cluster 8.0")), be sure that you have
  them configured the way you want before starting the server.
  If you are using `InnoDB` tables, see
  [Section 17.8, “InnoDB Configuration”](innodb-configuration.md "17.8 InnoDB Configuration") for guidelines and
  [Section 17.14, “InnoDB Startup Options and System Variables”](innodb-parameters.md "17.14 InnoDB Startup Options and System Variables") for option syntax.

  Although storage engines use default values for options that
  you omit, Oracle recommends that you review the available
  options and specify explicit values for any options whose
  defaults are not appropriate for your installation.
- Make sure that the server knows where to find the
  [data directory](glossary.md#glos_data_directory "data directory").
  The [**mysqld**](mysqld.md "6.3.1 mysqld — The MySQL Server") server uses this directory as
  its current directory. This is where it expects to find
  databases and where it expects to write log files. The
  server also writes the pid (process ID) file in the data
  directory.

  The default data directory location is hardcoded when the
  server is compiled. To determine what the default path
  settings are, invoke [**mysqld**](mysqld.md "6.3.1 mysqld — The MySQL Server") with the
  [`--verbose`](server-options.md#option_mysqld_verbose) and
  [`--help`](server-options.md#option_mysqld_help) options. If the data
  directory is located somewhere else on your system, specify
  that location with the
  [`--datadir`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_datadir) option to
  [**mysqld**](mysqld.md "6.3.1 mysqld — The MySQL Server") or [**mysqld\_safe**](mysqld-safe.md "6.3.2 mysqld_safe — MySQL Server Startup Script"),
  on the command line or in an option file. Otherwise, the
  server does not work properly. As an alternative to the
  [`--datadir`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_datadir) option, you can
  specify [**mysqld**](mysqld.md "6.3.1 mysqld — The MySQL Server") the location of the base
  directory under which MySQL is installed with the
  [`--basedir`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_basedir), and
  [**mysqld**](mysqld.md "6.3.1 mysqld — The MySQL Server") looks for the
  `data` directory there.

  To check the effect of specifying path options, invoke
  [**mysqld**](mysqld.md "6.3.1 mysqld — The MySQL Server") with those options followed by the
  [`--verbose`](server-options.md#option_mysqld_verbose) and
  [`--help`](server-options.md#option_mysqld_help) options. For example,
  if you change location to the directory where
  [**mysqld**](mysqld.md "6.3.1 mysqld — The MySQL Server") is installed and then run the
  following command, it shows the effect of starting the
  server with a base directory of
  `/usr/local`:

  ```terminal
  $> ./mysqld --basedir=/usr/local --verbose --help
  ```

  You can specify other options such as
  [`--datadir`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_datadir) as well, but
  [`--verbose`](server-options.md#option_mysqld_verbose) and
  [`--help`](server-options.md#option_mysqld_help) must be the last
  options.

  Once you determine the path settings you want, start the
  server without [`--verbose`](server-options.md#option_mysqld_verbose) and
  [`--help`](server-options.md#option_mysqld_help).

  If [**mysqld**](mysqld.md "6.3.1 mysqld — The MySQL Server") is currently running, you can
  find out what path settings it is using by executing this
  command:

  ```terminal
  $> mysqladmin variables
  ```

  Or:

  ```terminal
  $> mysqladmin -h host_name variables
  ```

  *`host_name`* is the name of the
  MySQL server host.
- Make sure that the server can access the
  [data directory](glossary.md#glos_data_directory "data directory").
  The ownership and permissions of the data directory and its
  contents must allow the server to read and modify them.

  If you get `Errcode 13` (which means
  `Permission denied`) when starting
  [**mysqld**](mysqld.md "6.3.1 mysqld — The MySQL Server"), this means that the privileges of
  the data directory or its contents do not permit server
  access. In this case, you change the permissions for the
  involved files and directories so that the server has the
  right to use them. You can also start the server as
  `root`, but this raises security issues and
  should be avoided.

  Change location to the data directory and check the
  ownership of the data directory and its contents to make
  sure the server has access. For example, if the data
  directory is `/usr/local/mysql/var`, use
  this command:

  ```terminal
  $> ls -la /usr/local/mysql/var
  ```

  If the data directory or its files or subdirectories are not
  owned by the login account that you use for running the
  server, change their ownership to that account. If the
  account is named `mysql`, use these
  commands:

  ```terminal
  $> chown -R mysql /usr/local/mysql/var
  $> chgrp -R mysql /usr/local/mysql/var
  ```

  Even with correct ownership, MySQL might fail to start up if
  there is other security software running on your system that
  manages application access to various parts of the file
  system. In this case, reconfigure that software to enable
  [**mysqld**](mysqld.md "6.3.1 mysqld — The MySQL Server") to access the directories it uses
  during normal operation.
- Verify that the network interfaces the server wants to use
  are available.

  If either of the following errors occur, it means that some
  other program (perhaps another [**mysqld**](mysqld.md "6.3.1 mysqld — The MySQL Server")
  server) is using the TCP/IP port or Unix socket file that
  [**mysqld**](mysqld.md "6.3.1 mysqld — The MySQL Server") is trying to use:

  ```none
  Can't start server: Bind on TCP/IP port: Address already in use
  Can't start server: Bind on unix socket...
  ```

  Use **ps** to determine whether you have
  another [**mysqld**](mysqld.md "6.3.1 mysqld — The MySQL Server") server running. If so,
  shut down the server before starting
  [**mysqld**](mysqld.md "6.3.1 mysqld — The MySQL Server") again. (If another server is
  running, and you really want to run multiple servers, you
  can find information about how to do so in
  [Section 7.8, “Running Multiple MySQL Instances on One Machine”](multiple-servers.md "7.8 Running Multiple MySQL Instances on One Machine").)

  If no other server is running, execute the command
  `telnet your_host_name
  tcp_ip_port_number`.
  (The default MySQL port number is 3306.) Then press Enter a
  couple of times. If you do not get an error message like
  `telnet: Unable to connect to remote host:
  Connection refused`, some other program is using
  the TCP/IP port that [**mysqld**](mysqld.md "6.3.1 mysqld — The MySQL Server") is trying to
  use. Track down what program this is and disable it, or tell
  [**mysqld**](mysqld.md "6.3.1 mysqld — The MySQL Server") to listen to a different port with
  the [`--port`](server-options.md#option_mysqld_port) option. In this
  case, specify the same non-default port number for client
  programs when connecting to the server using TCP/IP.

  Another reason the port might be inaccessible is that you
  have a firewall running that blocks connections to it. If
  so, modify the firewall settings to permit access to the
  port.

  If the server starts but you cannot connect to it, make sure
  that you have an entry in `/etc/hosts`
  that looks like this:

  ```none
  127.0.0.1       localhost
  ```
- If you cannot get [**mysqld**](mysqld.md "6.3.1 mysqld — The MySQL Server") to start, try to
  make a trace file to find the problem by using the
  [`--debug`](server-options.md#option_mysqld_debug) option. See
  [Section 7.9.4, “The DBUG Package”](dbug-package.md "7.9.4 The DBUG Package").
