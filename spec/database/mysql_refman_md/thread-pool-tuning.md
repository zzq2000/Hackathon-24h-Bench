#### 7.6.3.4 Thread Pool Tuning

This section provides guidelines on determining the best
configuration for thread pool performance, as measured using a
metric such as transactions per second.

Of chief importance is the number of thread groups in the thread
pool, which can be set on server startup using the
[`--thread-pool-size`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_thread_pool_size) option; this
cannot be changed at runtime. Recommended values for this option
depend on whether the primary storage engine in use is
[`InnoDB`](innodb-storage-engine.md "Chapter 17 The InnoDB Storage Engine") or
[`MyISAM`](myisam-storage-engine.md "18.2 The MyISAM Storage Engine"):

- If the primary storage engine is `InnoDB`,
  the recommended value for the thread pool size is the number
  of physical cores available on the host machine, up to a
  maximum of 512.
- If the primary storage engine is `MyISAM`,
  the thread pool size should be fairly low. Optimal
  performance is often seen with values from 4 to 8. Higher
  values tend to have a slightly negative but not dramatic
  impact on performance.

The upper limit on the number of concurrent transactions that
can be processed by the thread pool plugin is determined by the
value of
[`thread_pool_max_transactions_limit`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_thread_pool_max_transactions_limit).
The recommendation initial setting for this system variable is
the number of physical cores times 32. You may need to adjust
the value from this starting point to suit a given workload; a
reasonable upper bound for this value is the maximum number of
concurrent connections expected; the value of the
[`Max_used_connections`](server-status-variables.md#statvar_Max_used_connections) status
variable can serve as a guide to determining this. A good way to
proceed is to start with
`thread_pool_max_transactions_limit` set to
this value, then adjust it downwards while observing the effect
on throughput.

The maximum number of query threads permitted in a thread group
is determined by the value of
[`thread_pool_query_threads_per_group`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_thread_pool_query_threads_per_group),
which can be adjusted at runtime. The product of this value and
the thread pool size is approximately equal to the total number
of threads available to process queries. Obtaining the best
performance usually means striking the proper balance for your
application between
`thread_pool_query_threads_per_group` and the
thread pool size. Greater values for
`thread_pool_query_threads_per_group` value
make it less likely that all the threads in the thread group
simultaneously execute long running queries while blocking
shorter ones when the workload includes both long and short
running queries. You should bear in mind that the overhead of
the connection polling operation for each thread group increases
when using smaller values for the thread pool size with larger
values for
`thread_pool_query_threads_per_group`. For this
reason, we recommend a starting value of `2`
for `thread_pool_query_threads_per_group`;
setting this variable to a lower value usually does not offer
any performance benefit.

For best performance under normal conditions, we also recommend
that you set
[`thread_pool_algorithm`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_thread_pool_algorithm) to 1 for
high concurrency.

In addition, the value of the
[`thread_pool_stall_limit`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_thread_pool_stall_limit) system
variable determines the handling of blocked and long-running
statements. If all calls blocking the MySQL Server were reported
to the thread pool, it would always know when execution threads
are blocked, but this may not always be true. For example,
blocks could occur in code that has not been instrumented with
thread pool callbacks. For such cases, the thread pool must be
able to identify threads that appear to be blocked. This is done
by means of a timeout determined by the value of
`thread_pool_stall_limit`, which ensures that
the server does not become completely blocked. The value of
`thread_pool_stall_limit` represents a number
of 10-millisecond intervals, so that `600` (the
maximum) represents 6 seconds.

[`thread_pool_stall_limit`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_thread_pool_stall_limit) also
enables the thread pool to handle long-running statements. If a
long-running statement were permitted to block a thread group,
all other connections assigned to the group would be blocked and
unable to start execution until the long-running statement
completed. In the worst case, this could take hours or even
days.

The value of
[`thread_pool_stall_limit`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_thread_pool_stall_limit) should
be chosen such that statements that execute longer than its
value are considered stalled. Stalled statements generate a lot
of extra overhead since they involve extra context switches and
in some cases even extra thread creations. On the other hand,
setting the
[`thread_pool_stall_limit`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_thread_pool_stall_limit)
parameter too high means that long-running statements block a
number of short-running statements for longer than necessary.
Short wait values permit threads to start more quickly. Short
values are also better for avoiding deadlock situations. Long
wait values are useful for workloads that include long-running
statements, to avoid starting too many new statements while the
current ones execute.

Suppose a server executes a workload where 99.9% of the
statements complete within 100ms even when the server is loaded,
and the remaining statements take between 100ms and 2 hours
fairly evenly spread. In this case, it would make sense to set
[`thread_pool_stall_limit`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_thread_pool_stall_limit) to 10
(10 × 10ms = 100ms). The default value of 6 (60ms)
is suitable for servers that primarily execute very simple
statements.

The [`thread_pool_stall_limit`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_thread_pool_stall_limit)
parameter can be changed at runtime to enable you to strike a
balance appropriate for the server work load. Assuming that the
[`tp_thread_group_stats`](performance-schema-tp-thread-group-stats-table.md "29.12.16.2 The tp_thread_group_stats Table") table is
enabled, you can use the following query to determine the
fraction of executed statements that stalled:

```sql
SELECT SUM(STALLED_QUERIES_EXECUTED) / SUM(QUERIES_EXECUTED)
FROM performance_schema.tp_thread_group_stats;
```

This number should be as low as possible. To decrease the
likelihood of statements stalling, increase the value of
[`thread_pool_stall_limit`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_thread_pool_stall_limit).

When a statement arrives, what is the maximum time it can be
delayed before it actually starts executing? Suppose that the
following conditions apply:

- There are 200 statements queued in the low-priority queue.
- There are 10 statements queued in the high-priority queue.
- [`thread_pool_prio_kickup_timer`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_thread_pool_prio_kickup_timer)
  is set to 10000 (10 seconds).
- [`thread_pool_stall_limit`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_thread_pool_stall_limit) is
  set to 100 (1 second).

In the worst case, the 10 high-priority statements represent 10
transactions that continue executing for a long time. Thus, in
the worst case, no statements can be moved to the high-priority
queue because it always already contains statements awaiting
execution. After 10 seconds, the new statement is eligible to be
moved to the high-priority queue. However, before it can be
moved, all the statements before it must be moved as well. This
could take another 2 seconds because a maximum of 100 statements
per second are moved to the high-priority queue. Now when the
statement reaches the high-priority queue, there could
potentially be many long-running statements ahead of it. In the
worst case, every one of those becomes stalled and 1 second is
required for each statement before the next statement is
retrieved from the high-priority queue. Thus, in this scenario,
it takes 222 seconds before the new statement starts executing.

This example shows a worst case for an application. How to
handle it depends on the application. If the application has
high requirements for the response time, it should most likely
throttle users at a higher level itself. Otherwise, it can use
the thread pool configuration parameters to set some kind of a
maximum waiting time.
