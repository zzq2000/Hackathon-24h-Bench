#### 19.5.1.6 Replication of CREATE ... IF NOT EXISTS Statements

MySQL applies these rules when various `CREATE ... IF
NOT EXISTS` statements are replicated:

- Every
  [`CREATE
  DATABASE IF NOT EXISTS`](create-database.md "15.1.12 CREATE DATABASE Statement") statement is replicated,
  whether or not the database already exists on the source.
- Similarly, every
  [`CREATE TABLE
  IF NOT EXISTS`](create-table.md "15.1.20 CREATE TABLE Statement") statement without a
  [`SELECT`](select.md "15.2.13 SELECT Statement") is replicated, whether
  or not the table already exists on the source. This includes
  [`CREATE
  TABLE IF NOT EXISTS ... LIKE`](create-table-like.md "15.1.20.3 CREATE TABLE ... LIKE Statement"). Replication of
  [`CREATE
  TABLE IF NOT EXISTS ... SELECT`](create-table-select.md "15.1.20.4 CREATE TABLE ... SELECT Statement") follows somewhat
  different rules; see
  [Section 19.5.1.7, “Replication of CREATE TABLE ... SELECT Statements”](replication-features-create-select.md "19.5.1.7 Replication of CREATE TABLE ... SELECT Statements"), for
  more information.
- [`CREATE EVENT
  IF NOT EXISTS`](create-event.md "15.1.13 CREATE EVENT Statement") is always replicated, whether or not
  the event named in the statement already exists on the
  source.
- [`CREATE USER`](create-user.md "15.7.1.3 CREATE USER Statement") is written to the
  binary log only if successful. If the statement includes
  `IF NOT EXISTS`, it is considered
  successful, and is logged as long as at least one user named
  in the statement is created; in such cases, the statement is
  logged as written; this includes references to existing
  users that were not created. See
  [CREATE USER Binary Logging](create-user.md#create-user-binary-logging "CREATE USER Binary Logging"), for more
  information.
- (*MySQL 8.0.29 and later*:)
  [`CREATE
  PROCEDURE IF NOT EXISTS`](create-procedure.md "15.1.17 CREATE PROCEDURE and CREATE FUNCTION Statements"),
  [`CREATE
  FUNCTION IF NOT EXISTS`](create-function.md "15.1.14 CREATE FUNCTION Statement"), or
  [`CREATE
  TRIGGER IF NOT EXISTS`](create-trigger.md "15.1.22 CREATE TRIGGER Statement"), if successful, is written
  in its entirety to the binary log (including the `IF
  NOT EXISTS` clause), whether or not the statement
  raised a warning because the object (procedure, function, or
  trigger) already existed.
