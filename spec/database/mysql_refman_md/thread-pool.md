Note

MySQL Enterprise Thread Pool is an extension included in MySQL Enterprise Edition, a commercial product.

MySQL Enterprise Edition includes MySQL Enterprise Thread Pool, implemented using a server plugin. The
default thread-handling model in MySQL Server executes statements
using one thread per client connection. As more clients connect to
the server and execute statements, overall performance degrades.
The thread pool plugin provides an alternative thread-handling
model designed to reduce overhead and improve performance. The
plugin implements a thread pool that increases server performance
by efficiently managing statement execution threads for large
numbers of client connections.

The thread pool addresses several problems of the model that uses
one thread per connection:

- Too many thread stacks make CPU caches almost useless in
  highly parallel execution workloads. The thread pool promotes
  thread stack reuse to minimize the CPU cache footprint.
- With too many threads executing in parallel, context switching
  overhead is high. This also presents a challenge to the
  operating system scheduler. The thread pool controls the
  number of active threads to keep the parallelism within the
  MySQL server at a level that it can handle and that is
  appropriate for the server host on which MySQL is executing.
- Too many transactions executing in parallel increases resource
  contention. In [`InnoDB`](innodb-storage-engine.md "Chapter 17 The InnoDB Storage Engine"), this
  increases the time spent holding central mutexes. The thread
  pool controls when transactions start to ensure that not too
  many execute in parallel.
