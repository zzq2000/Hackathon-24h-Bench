#### B.3.2.17 Table-Corruption Issues

If you have started [**mysqld**](mysqld.md "6.3.1 mysqld — The MySQL Server") with the
[`myisam_recover_options`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_myisam_recover_options) system
variable set, MySQL automatically checks and tries to repair
`MyISAM` tables if they are marked as 'not
closed properly' or 'crashed'. If this happens, MySQL writes
an entry in the `hostname.err` file
`'Warning: Checking table ...'` which is
followed by `Warning: Repairing table` if the
table needs to be repaired. If you get a lot of these errors,
without [**mysqld**](mysqld.md "6.3.1 mysqld — The MySQL Server") having died unexpectedly
just before, then something is wrong and needs to be
investigated further.

When the server detects `MyISAM` table
corruption, it writes additional information to the error log,
such as the name and line number of the source file, and the
list of threads accessing the table. Example: `Got an
error from thread_id=1, mi_dynrec.c:368`. This is
useful information to include in bug reports.
