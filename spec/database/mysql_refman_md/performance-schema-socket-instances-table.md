#### 29.12.3.5 The socket\_instances Table

The [`socket_instances`](performance-schema-socket-instances-table.md "29.12.3.5 The socket_instances Table") table
provides a real-time snapshot of the active connections to the
MySQL server. The table contains one row per TCP/IP or Unix
socket file connection. Information available in this table
provides a real-time snapshot of the active connections to the
server. (Additional information is available in socket summary
tables, including network activity such as socket operations
and number of bytes transmitted and received; see
[Section 29.12.20.9, “Socket Summary Tables”](performance-schema-socket-summary-tables.md "29.12.20.9 Socket Summary Tables")).

Socket instruments have names of the form
`wait/io/socket/sql/socket_type`
and are used like this:

1. The server has a listening socket for each network
   protocol that it supports. The instruments associated with
   listening sockets for TCP/IP or Unix socket file
   connections have a *`socket_type`*
   value of `server_tcpip_socket` or
   `server_unix_socket`, respectively.
2. When a listening socket detects a connection, the server
   transfers the connection to a new socket managed by a
   separate thread. The instrument for the new connection
   thread has a *`socket_type`* value
   of `client_connection`.
3. When a connection terminates, the row in
   [`socket_instances`](performance-schema-socket-instances-table.md "29.12.3.5 The socket_instances Table")
   corresponding to it is deleted.

The [`socket_instances`](performance-schema-socket-instances-table.md "29.12.3.5 The socket_instances Table") table has
these columns:

- `EVENT_NAME`

  The name of the `wait/io/socket/*`
  instrument that produced the event. This is a
  `NAME` value from the
  [`setup_instruments`](performance-schema-setup-instruments-table.md "29.12.2.3 The setup_instruments Table") table.
  Instrument names may have multiple parts and form a
  hierarchy, as discussed in
  [Section 29.6, “Performance Schema Instrument Naming Conventions”](performance-schema-instrument-naming.md "29.6 Performance Schema Instrument Naming Conventions").
- `OBJECT_INSTANCE_BEGIN`

  This column uniquely identifies the socket. The value is
  the address of an object in memory.
- `THREAD_ID`

  The internal thread identifier assigned by the server.
  Each socket is managed by a single thread, so each socket
  can be mapped to a thread which can be mapped to a server
  process.
- `SOCKET_ID`

  The internal file handle assigned to the socket.
- `IP`

  The client IP address. The value may be either an IPv4 or
  IPv6 address, or blank to indicate a Unix socket file
  connection.
- `PORT`

  The TCP/IP port number, in the range from 0 to 65535.
- `STATE`

  The socket status, either `IDLE` or
  `ACTIVE`. Wait times for active sockets
  are tracked using the corresponding socket instrument.
  Wait times for idle sockets are tracked using the
  `idle` instrument.

  A socket is idle if it is waiting for a request from the
  client. When a socket becomes idle, the event row in
  [`socket_instances`](performance-schema-socket-instances-table.md "29.12.3.5 The socket_instances Table") that is
  tracking the socket switches from a status of
  `ACTIVE` to `IDLE`. The
  `EVENT_NAME` value remains
  `wait/io/socket/*`, but timing for the
  instrument is suspended. Instead, an event is generated in
  the [`events_waits_current`](performance-schema-events-waits-current-table.md "29.12.4.1 The events_waits_current Table")
  table with an `EVENT_NAME` value of
  `idle`.

  When the next request is received, the
  `idle` event terminates, the socket
  instance switches from `IDLE` to
  `ACTIVE`, and timing of the socket
  instrument resumes.

The [`socket_instances`](performance-schema-socket-instances-table.md "29.12.3.5 The socket_instances Table") table has
these indexes:

- Primary key on (`OBJECT_INSTANCE_BEGIN`)
- Index on (`THREAD_ID`)
- Index on (`SOCKET_ID`)
- Index on (`IP`, `PORT`)

[`TRUNCATE TABLE`](truncate-table.md "15.1.37 TRUNCATE TABLE Statement") is not permitted
for the [`socket_instances`](performance-schema-socket-instances-table.md "29.12.3.5 The socket_instances Table") table.

The `IP:PORT` column combination value
identifies the connection. This combination value is used in
the `OBJECT_NAME` column of the
`events_waits_xxx`
tables, to identify the connection from which socket events
come:

- For the Unix domain listener socket
  (`server_unix_socket`), the port is 0,
  and the IP is `''`.
- For client connections via the Unix domain listener
  (`client_connection`), the port is 0, and
  the IP is `''`.
- For the TCP/IP server listener socket
  (`server_tcpip_socket`), the port is
  always the master port (for example, 3306), and the IP is
  always `0.0.0.0`.
- For client connections via the TCP/IP listener
  (`client_connection`), the port is
  whatever the server assigns, but never 0. The IP is the IP
  of the originating host (`127.0.0.1` or
  `::1` for the local host)
