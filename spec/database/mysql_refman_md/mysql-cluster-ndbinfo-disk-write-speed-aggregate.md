#### 25.6.16.28 The ndbinfo disk\_write\_speed\_aggregate Table

The `disk_write_speed_aggregate` table provides
aggregated information about the speed of disk writes during
LCP, backup, and restore operations.

The `disk_write_speed_aggregate` table contains
the following columns:

- `node_id`

  Node ID of this node
- `thr_no`

  Thread ID of this LDM thread
- `backup_lcp_speed_last_sec`

  Number of bytes written to disk by backup and LCP processes
  in the last second
- `redo_speed_last_sec`

  Number of bytes written to REDO log in the last second
- `backup_lcp_speed_last_10sec`

  Number of bytes written to disk by backup and LCP processes
  per second, averaged over the last 10 seconds
- `redo_speed_last_10sec`

  Number of bytes written to REDO log per second, averaged
  over the last 10 seconds
- `std_dev_backup_lcp_speed_last_10sec`

  Standard deviation in number of bytes written to disk by
  backup and LCP processes per second, averaged over the last
  10 seconds
- `std_dev_redo_speed_last_10sec`

  Standard deviation in number of bytes written to REDO log
  per second, averaged over the last 10 seconds
- `backup_lcp_speed_last_60sec`

  Number of bytes written to disk by backup and LCP processes
  per second, averaged over the last 60 seconds
- `redo_speed_last_60sec`

  Number of bytes written to REDO log per second, averaged
  over the last 10 seconds
- `std_dev_backup_lcp_speed_last_60sec`

  Standard deviation in number of bytes written to disk by
  backup and LCP processes per second, averaged over the last
  60 seconds
- `std_dev_redo_speed_last_60sec`

  Standard deviation in number of bytes written to REDO log
  per second, averaged over the last 60 seconds
- `slowdowns_due_to_io_lag`

  Number of seconds since last node start that disk writes
  were slowed due to REDO log I/O lag
- `slowdowns_due_to_high_cpu`

  Number of seconds since last node start that disk writes
  were slowed due to high CPU usage
- `disk_write_speed_set_to_min`

  Number of seconds since last node start that disk write
  speed was set to minimum
- `current_target_disk_write_speed`

  Actual speed of disk writes per LDM thread (aggregated)
