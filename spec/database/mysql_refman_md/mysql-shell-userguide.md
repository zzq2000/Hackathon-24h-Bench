# Chapter 21 MySQL Shell

MySQL Shell is an advanced client and code editor for MySQL Server.
In addition to the provided SQL functionality, similar to
[**mysql**](mysql.md "6.5.1 mysql — The MySQL Command-Line Client"), MySQL Shell provides scripting
capabilities for JavaScript and Python and includes APIs for working
with MySQL. MySQL Shell is a component that you can install
separately.

The following discussion briefly describes MySQL Shell's
capabilities. For more information, see the MySQL Shell manual,
available at <https://dev.mysql.com/doc/mysql-shell/en/>.

MySQL Shell includes the following APIs implemented in JavaScript
and Python which you can use to develop code that interacts with
MySQL.

- The X DevAPI enables developers to work with both relational
  and document data when MySQL Shell is connected to a MySQL
  server using the X Protocol. This enables you to use MySQL as a
  Document Store, sometimes referred to as “using
  NoSQL”. For more information, see
  [Chapter 22, *Using MySQL as a Document Store*](document-store.md "Chapter 22 Using MySQL as a Document Store"). For documentation on the
  concepts and usage of X DevAPI, which is implemented in
  MySQL Shell, see [X DevAPI User Guide](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/x-devapi-userguide/en/).
- The AdminAPI enables database administrators to work with
  InnoDB Cluster, which provides an integrated solution for high
  availability and scalability using InnoDB based MySQL databases,
  without requiring advanced MySQL expertise. The AdminAPI also
  includes support for InnoDB ReplicaSet, which enables you to
  administer a set of MySQL instances running asynchronous
  GTID-based replication in a similar way to InnoDB Cluster.
  Additionally, the AdminAPI makes administration of MySQL Router
  easier, including integration with both InnoDB Cluster and
  InnoDB ReplicaSet. See [MySQL AdminAPI](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/mysql-shell/8.0/en/admin-api-userguide.html).

MySQL Shell is available in two editions, the Community Edition and
the Commercial Edition. The Community Edition is available free of
charge. The Commercial Edition provides additional Enterprise
features at low cost.
