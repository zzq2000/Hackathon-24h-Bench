#### 19.5.1.40 Replication and Views

Views are always replicated to replicas. Views are filtered by
their own name, not by the tables they refer to. This means that
a view can be replicated to the replica even if the view
contains a table that would normally be filtered out by
`replication-ignore-table` rules. Care should
therefore be taken to ensure that views do not replicate table
data that would normally be filtered for security reasons.

Replication from a table to a same-named view is supported using
statement-based logging, but not when using row-based logging.
Trying to do so when row-based logging is in effect causes an
error.
