### 8.2.4 Specifying Account Names

MySQL account names consist of a user name and a host name, which
enables creation of distinct accounts for users with the same user
name who connect from different hosts. This section describes the
syntax for account names, including special values and wildcard
rules.

In most respects, account names are similar to MySQL role names,
with some differences described at [Section 8.2.5, “Specifying Role Names”](role-names.md "8.2.5 Specifying Role Names").

Account names appear in SQL statements such as
[`CREATE USER`](create-user.md "15.7.1.3 CREATE USER Statement"),
[`GRANT`](grant.md "15.7.1.6 GRANT Statement"), and [`SET
PASSWORD`](set-password.md "15.7.1.10 SET PASSWORD Statement") and follow these rules:

- Account name syntax is
  `'user_name'@'host_name'`.
- The `@'host_name'`
  part is optional. An account name consisting only of a user
  name is equivalent to
  `'user_name'@'%'`.
  For example, `'me'` is equivalent to
  `'me'@'%'`.
- The user name and host name need not be quoted if they are
  legal as unquoted identifiers. Quotes must be used if a
  *`user_name`* string contains special
  characters (such as space or `-`), or a
  *`host_name`* string contains special
  characters or wildcard characters (such as
  `.` or `%`). For example, in
  the account name `'test-user'@'%.com'`, both
  the user name and host name parts require quotes.
- Quote user names and host names as identifiers or as strings,
  using either backticks (`` ` ``), single
  quotation marks (`'`), or double quotation
  marks (`"`). For string-quoting and
  identifier-quoting guidelines, see
  [Section 11.1.1, “String Literals”](string-literals.md "11.1.1 String Literals"), and
  [Section 11.2, “Schema Object Names”](identifiers.md "11.2 Schema Object Names"). In
  [`SHOW`](show.md "15.7.7 SHOW Statements") statement results, user
  names and host names are quoted using backticks
  (`` ` ``).
- The user name and host name parts, if quoted, must be quoted
  separately. That is, write
  `'me'@'localhost'`, not
  `'me@localhost'`. (The latter is actually
  equivalent to `'me@localhost'@'%'`, although
  this behavior is now deprecated.)
- A reference to the [`CURRENT_USER`](information-functions.md#function_current-user)
  or [`CURRENT_USER()`](information-functions.md#function_current-user) function is
  equivalent to specifying the current client's user name and
  host name literally.

MySQL stores account names in grant tables in the
`mysql` system database using separate columns
for the user name and host name parts:

- The `user` table contains one row for each
  account. The `User` and
  `Host` columns store the user name and host
  name. This table also indicates which global privileges the
  account has.
- Other grant tables indicate privileges an account has for
  databases and objects within databases. These tables have
  `User` and `Host` columns to
  store the account name. Each row in these tables associates
  with the account in the `user` table that has
  the same `User` and `Host`
  values.
- For access-checking purposes, comparisons of User values are
  case-sensitive. Comparisons of Host values are not
  case-sensitive.

For additional detail about the properties of user names and host
names as stored in the grant tables, such as maximum length, see
[Grant Table Scope Column Properties](grant-tables.md#grant-tables-scope-column-properties "Grant Table Scope Column Properties").

User names and host names have certain special values or wildcard
conventions, as described following.

The user name part of an account name is either a nonblank value
that literally matches the user name for incoming connection
attempts, or a blank value (the empty string) that matches any
user name. An account with a blank user name is an anonymous user.
To specify an anonymous user in SQL statements, use a quoted empty
user name part, such as `''@'localhost'`.

The host name part of an account name can take many forms, and
wildcards are permitted:

- A host value can be a host name or an IP address (IPv4 or
  IPv6). The name `'localhost'` indicates the
  local host. The IP address `'127.0.0.1'`
  indicates the IPv4 loopback interface. The IP address
  `'::1'` indicates the IPv6 loopback
  interface.
- Use of the `%` and `_`
  wildcard characters is permitted in host name or IP address
  values, but is deprecated as of MySQL 8.0.35, and thus subject
  to removal in a future version of MySQL. These characters have
  the same meaning as for pattern-matching operations performed
  with the [`LIKE`](string-comparison-functions.md#operator_like) operator. For
  example, a host value of `'%'` matches any
  host name, whereas a value of `'%.mysql.com'`
  matches any host in the `mysql.com` domain.
  `'198.51.100.%'` matches any host in the
  198.51.100 class C network.

  Because IP wildcard values are permitted in host values (for
  example, `'198.51.100.%'` to match every host
  on a subnet), someone could try to exploit this capability by
  naming a host `198.51.100.somewhere.com`. To
  foil such attempts, MySQL does not perform matching on host
  names that start with digits and a dot. For example, if a host
  is named `1.2.example.com`, its name never
  matches the host part of account names. An IP wildcard value
  can match only IP addresses, not host names.

  If [`partial_revokes`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_partial_revokes) is
  `ON`, MySQL treats `%` and
  `_` in grants as literal characters, and not
  as wildcards. Beginning with MySQL 8.0.35, use of these
  wildcards is deprecated (regardless of this variable's
  value), and you should expect this functionality to be removed
  in a future version of MySQL.
- For a host value specified as an IPv4 address, a netmask can
  be given to indicate how many address bits to use for the
  network number. Netmask notation cannot be used for IPv6
  addresses.

  The syntax is
  `host_ip/netmask`.
  For example:

  ```sql
  CREATE USER 'david'@'198.51.100.0/255.255.255.0';
  ```

  This enables `david` to connect from any
  client host having an IP address
  *`client_ip`* for which the following
  condition is true:

  ```clike
  client_ip & netmask = host_ip
  ```

  That is, for the [`CREATE USER`](create-user.md "15.7.1.3 CREATE USER Statement")
  statement just shown:

  ```clike
  client_ip & 255.255.255.0 = 198.51.100.0
  ```

  IP addresses that satisfy this condition range from
  `198.51.100.0` to
  `198.51.100.255`.

  A netmask typically begins with bits set to 1, followed by
  bits set to 0. Examples:

  - `198.0.0.0/255.0.0.0`: Any host on the
    198 class A network
  - `198.51.0.0/255.255.0.0`: Any host on the
    198.51 class B network
  - `198.51.100.0/255.255.255.0`: Any host on
    the 198.51.100 class C network
  - `198.51.100.1`: Only the host with this
    specific IP address
- As of MySQL 8.0.23, a host value specified as an IPv4 address
  can be written using CIDR notation, such as
  `198.51.100.44/24`.

The server performs matching of host values in account names
against the client host using the value returned by the system DNS
resolver for the client host name or IP address. Except in the
case that the account host value is specified using netmask
notation, the server performs this comparison as a string match,
even for an account host value given as an IP address. This means
that you should specify account host values in the same format
used by DNS. Here are examples of problems to watch out for:

- Suppose that a host on the local network has a fully qualified
  name of `host1.example.com`. If DNS returns
  name lookups for this host as
  `host1.example.com`, use that name in account
  host values. If DNS returns just `host1`, use
  `host1` instead.
- If DNS returns the IP address for a given host as
  `198.51.100.2`, that matches an account host
  value of `198.51.100.2` but not
  `198.051.100.2`. Similarly, it matches an
  account host pattern like `198.51.100.%` but
  not `198.051.100.%`.

To avoid problems like these, it is advisable to check the format
in which your DNS returns host names and addresses. Use values in
the same format in MySQL account names.
