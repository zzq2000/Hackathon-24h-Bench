#### 6.2.2.2 Using Option Files

Most MySQL programs can read startup options from option files
(sometimes called configuration files). Option files provide a
convenient way to specify commonly used options so that they
need not be entered on the command line each time you run a
program.

To determine whether a program reads option files, invoke it
with the `--help` option. (For
[**mysqld**](mysqld.md "6.3.1 mysqld — The MySQL Server"), use
[`--verbose`](server-options.md#option_mysqld_verbose) and
[`--help`](server-options.md#option_mysqld_help).) If the program reads
option files, the help message indicates which files it looks
for and which option groups it recognizes.

Note

A MySQL program started with the
`--no-defaults` option reads no option files
other than `.mylogin.cnf`.

A server started with the
[`persisted_globals_load`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_persisted_globals_load) system
variable disabled does not read
`mysqld-auto.cnf`.

Many option files are plain text files, created using any text
editor. The exceptions are:

- The `.mylogin.cnf` file that contains
  login path options. This is an encrypted file created by the
  [**mysql\_config\_editor**](mysql-config-editor.md "6.6.7 mysql_config_editor — MySQL Configuration Utility") utility. See
  [Section 6.6.7, “mysql\_config\_editor — MySQL Configuration Utility”](mysql-config-editor.md "6.6.7 mysql_config_editor — MySQL Configuration Utility"). A “login
  path” is an option group that permits only certain
  options: `host`, `user`,
  `password`, `port` and
  `socket`. Client programs specify which login
  path to read from `.mylogin.cnf` using
  the [`--login-path`](option-file-options.md#option_general_login-path) option.

  To specify an alternative login path file name, set the
  `MYSQL_TEST_LOGIN_FILE` environment
  variable. This variable is used by the
  **mysql-test-run.pl** testing utility, but
  also is recognized by [**mysql\_config\_editor**](mysql-config-editor.md "6.6.7 mysql_config_editor — MySQL Configuration Utility")
  and by MySQL clients such as [**mysql**](mysql.md "6.5.1 mysql — The MySQL Command-Line Client"),
  [**mysqladmin**](mysqladmin.md "6.5.2 mysqladmin — A MySQL Server Administration Program"), and so forth.
- The `mysqld-auto.cnf` file in the data
  directory. This JSON-format file contains persisted system
  variable settings. It is created by the server upon
  execution of
  [`SET
  PERSIST`](set-variable.md "15.7.6.1 SET Syntax for Variable Assignment") or
  [`SET
  PERSIST_ONLY`](set-variable.md "15.7.6.1 SET Syntax for Variable Assignment") statements. See
  [Section 7.1.9.3, “Persisted System Variables”](persisted-system-variables.md "7.1.9.3 Persisted System Variables"). Management of
  `mysqld-auto.cnf` should be left to the
  server and not performed manually.

##### Option File Processing Order

MySQL looks for option files in the order described in the
following discussion and reads any that exist. If an option
file you want to use does not exist, create it using the
appropriate method, as just discussed.

Note

For information about option files used with NDB Cluster
programs, see [Section 25.4, “Configuration of NDB Cluster”](mysql-cluster-configuration.md "25.4 Configuration of NDB Cluster").

On Windows, MySQL programs read startup options from the files
shown in the following table, in the specified order (files
listed first are read first, files read later take
precedence).

**Table 6.1 Option Files Read on Windows Systems**

| File Name | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `%WINDIR%\my.ini`, `%WINDIR%\my.cnf` | Global options |
| `C:\my.ini`, `C:\my.cnf` | Global options |
| `BASEDIR\my.ini`, `BASEDIR\my.cnf` | Global options |
| `defaults-extra-file` | The file specified with [`--defaults-extra-file`](option-file-options.md#option_general_defaults-extra-file), if any |
| `%APPDATA%\MySQL\.mylogin.cnf` | Login path options (clients only) |
| `DATADIR\mysqld-auto.cnf` | System variables persisted with [`SET PERSIST`](set-variable.md "15.7.6.1 SET Syntax for Variable Assignment") or [`SET PERSIST_ONLY`](set-variable.md "15.7.6.1 SET Syntax for Variable Assignment") (server only) |

In the preceding table, `%WINDIR%` represents
the location of your Windows directory. This is commonly
`C:\WINDOWS`. Use the following command to
determine its exact location from the value of the
`WINDIR` environment variable:

```terminal
C:\> echo %WINDIR%
```

`%APPDATA%` represents the value of the
Windows application data directory. Use the following command
to determine its exact location from the value of the
`APPDATA` environment variable:

```terminal
C:\> echo %APPDATA%
```

*`BASEDIR`* represents the MySQL base
installation directory. When MySQL 8.0 has been
installed using MySQL Installer, this is typically
`C:\PROGRAMDIR\MySQL\MySQL
Server 8.0` in which
*`PROGRAMDIR`* represents the programs
directory (usually `Program Files` for
English-language versions of Windows). See
[Section 2.3.3, “MySQL Installer for Windows”](mysql-installer.md "2.3.3 MySQL Installer for Windows").

Important

Although MySQL Installer places most files under
*`PROGRAMDIR`*, it installs
`my.ini` under the
`C:\ProgramData\MySQL\MySQL Server
8.0\` directory by default.

*`DATADIR`* represents the MySQL data
directory. As used to find
`mysqld-auto.cnf`, its default value is the
data directory location built in when MySQL was compiled, but
can be changed by [`--datadir`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_datadir)
specified as an option-file or command-line option processed
before `mysqld-auto.cnf` is processed.

On Unix and Unix-like systems, MySQL programs read startup
options from the files shown in the following table, in the
specified order (files listed first are read first, files read
later take precedence).

Note

On Unix platforms, MySQL ignores configuration files that
are world-writable. This is intentional as a security
measure.

**Table 6.2 Option Files Read on Unix and Unix-Like Systems**

| File Name | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `/etc/my.cnf` | Global options |
| `/etc/mysql/my.cnf` | Global options |
| `SYSCONFDIR/my.cnf` | Global options |
| `$MYSQL_HOME/my.cnf` | Server-specific options (server only) |
| `defaults-extra-file` | The file specified with [`--defaults-extra-file`](option-file-options.md#option_general_defaults-extra-file), if any |
| `~/.my.cnf` | User-specific options |
| `~/.mylogin.cnf` | User-specific login path options (clients only) |
| `DATADIR/mysqld-auto.cnf` | System variables persisted with [`SET PERSIST`](set-variable.md "15.7.6.1 SET Syntax for Variable Assignment") or [`SET PERSIST_ONLY`](set-variable.md "15.7.6.1 SET Syntax for Variable Assignment") (server only) |

In the preceding table, `~` represents the
current user's home directory (the value of
`$HOME`).

*`SYSCONFDIR`* represents the directory
specified with the [`SYSCONFDIR`](source-configuration-options.md#option_cmake_sysconfdir)
option to **CMake** when MySQL was built. By
default, this is the `etc` directory
located under the compiled-in installation directory.

`MYSQL_HOME` is an environment variable
containing the path to the directory in which the
server-specific `my.cnf` file resides. If
`MYSQL_HOME` is not set and you start the
server using the [**mysqld\_safe**](mysqld-safe.md "6.3.2 mysqld_safe — MySQL Server Startup Script") program,
[**mysqld\_safe**](mysqld-safe.md "6.3.2 mysqld_safe — MySQL Server Startup Script") sets it to
*`BASEDIR`*, the MySQL base
installation directory.

*`DATADIR`* represents the MySQL data
directory. As used to find
`mysqld-auto.cnf`, its default value is the
data directory location built in when MySQL was compiled, but
can be changed by [`--datadir`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_datadir)
specified as an option-file or command-line option processed
before `mysqld-auto.cnf` is processed.

If multiple instances of a given option are found, the last
instance takes precedence, with one exception: For
[**mysqld**](mysqld.md "6.3.1 mysqld — The MySQL Server"), the *first*
instance of the [`--user`](server-options.md#option_mysqld_user) option
is used as a security precaution, to prevent a user specified
in an option file from being overridden on the command line.

##### Option File Syntax

The following description of option file syntax applies to
files that you edit manually. This excludes
`.mylogin.cnf`, which is created using
[**mysql\_config\_editor**](mysql-config-editor.md "6.6.7 mysql_config_editor — MySQL Configuration Utility") and is encrypted, and
`mysqld-auto.cnf`, which the server creates
in JSON format.

Any long option that may be given on the command line when
running a MySQL program can be given in an option file as
well. To get the list of available options for a program, run
it with the `--help` option. (For
[**mysqld**](mysqld.md "6.3.1 mysqld — The MySQL Server"), use
[`--verbose`](server-options.md#option_mysqld_verbose) and
[`--help`](server-options.md#option_mysqld_help).)

The syntax for specifying options in an option file is similar
to command-line syntax (see
[Section 6.2.2.1, “Using Options on the Command Line”](command-line-options.md "6.2.2.1 Using Options on the Command Line")). However, in an option
file, you omit the leading two dashes from the option name and
you specify only one option per line. For example,
`--quick` and `--host=localhost`
on the command line should be specified as
`quick` and `host=localhost`
on separate lines in an option file. To specify an option of
the form
`--loose-opt_name`
in an option file, write it as
`loose-opt_name`.

Empty lines in option files are ignored. Nonempty lines can
take any of the following forms:

- `#comment`,
  `;comment`

  Comment lines start with `#` or
  `;`. A `#` comment can
  start in the middle of a line as well.
- `[group]`

  *`group`* is the name of the
  program or group for which you want to set options. After
  a group line, any option-setting lines apply to the named
  group until the end of the option file or another group
  line is given. Option group names are not case-sensitive.
- `opt_name`

  This is equivalent to
  `--opt_name` on
  the command line.
- `opt_name=value`

  This is equivalent to
  `--opt_name=value`
  on the command line. In an option file, you can have
  spaces around the `=` character,
  something that is not true on the command line. The value
  optionally can be enclosed within single quotation marks
  or double quotation marks, which is useful if the value
  contains a `#` comment character.

Leading and trailing spaces are automatically deleted from
option names and values.

You can use the escape sequences `\b`,
`\t`, `\n`,
`\r`, `\\`, and
`\s` in option values to represent the
backspace, tab, newline, carriage return, backslash, and space
characters. In option files, these escaping rules apply:

- A backslash followed by a valid escape sequence character
  is converted to the character represented by the sequence.
  For example, `\s` is converted to a
  space.
- A backslash not followed by a valid escape sequence
  character remains unchanged. For example,
  `\S` is retained as is.

The preceding rules mean that a literal backslash can be given
as `\\`, or as `\` if it is
not followed by a valid escape sequence character.

The rules for escape sequences in option files differ slightly
from the rules for escape sequences in string literals in SQL
statements. In the latter context, if
“*`x`*” is not a valid
escape sequence character,
`\x` becomes
“*`x`*” rather than
`\x`. See
[Section 11.1.1, “String Literals”](string-literals.md "11.1.1 String Literals").

The escaping rules for option file values are especially
pertinent for Windows path names, which use
`\` as a path name separator. A separator in
a Windows path name must be written as `\\`
if it is followed by an escape sequence character. It can be
written as `\\` or `\` if it
is not. Alternatively, `/` may be used in
Windows path names and is treated as `\`.
Suppose that you want to specify a base directory of
`C:\Program Files\MySQL\MySQL Server
8.0` in an option file. This can be
done several ways. Some examples:

```ini
basedir="C:\Program Files\MySQL\MySQL Server 8.0"
basedir="C:\\Program Files\\MySQL\\MySQL Server 8.0"
basedir="C:/Program Files/MySQL/MySQL Server 8.0"
basedir=C:\\Program\sFiles\\MySQL\\MySQL\sServer\s8.0
```

If an option group name is the same as a program name, options
in the group apply specifically to that program. For example,
the `[mysqld]` and `[mysql]`
groups apply to the [**mysqld**](mysqld.md "6.3.1 mysqld — The MySQL Server") server and the
[**mysql**](mysql.md "6.5.1 mysql — The MySQL Command-Line Client") client program, respectively.

The `[client]` option group is read by all
client programs provided in MySQL distributions (but
*not* by [**mysqld**](mysqld.md "6.3.1 mysqld — The MySQL Server")). To
understand how third-party client programs that use the C API
can use option files, see the C API documentation at
[mysql\_options()](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/c-api/8.0/en/mysql-options.html).

The `[client]` group enables you to specify
options that apply to all clients. For example,
`[client]` is the appropriate group to use to
specify the password for connecting to the server. (But make
sure that the option file is accessible only by yourself, so
that other people cannot discover your password.) Be sure not
to put an option in the `[client]` group
unless it is recognized by *all* client
programs that you use. Programs that do not understand the
option quit after displaying an error message if you try to
run them.

List more general option groups first and more specific groups
later. For example, a `[client]` group is
more general because it is read by all client programs,
whereas a `[mysqldump]` group is read only by
[**mysqldump**](mysqldump.md "6.5.4 mysqldump — A Database Backup Program"). Options specified later override
options specified earlier, so putting the option groups in the
order `[client]`,
`[mysqldump]` enables
[**mysqldump**](mysqldump.md "6.5.4 mysqldump — A Database Backup Program")-specific options to override
`[client]` options.

Here is a typical global option file:

```ini
[client]
port=3306
socket=/tmp/mysql.sock

[mysqld]
port=3306
socket=/tmp/mysql.sock
key_buffer_size=16M
max_allowed_packet=128M

[mysqldump]
quick
```

Here is a typical user option file:

```ini
[client]
# The following password is sent to all standard MySQL clients
password="my password"

[mysql]
no-auto-rehash
connect_timeout=2
```

To create option groups to be read only by
[**mysqld**](mysqld.md "6.3.1 mysqld — The MySQL Server") servers from specific MySQL release
series, use groups with names of
`[mysqld-5.7]`,
`[mysqld-8.0]`, and so forth.
The following group indicates that the
[`sql_mode`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_sql_mode) setting should be
used only by MySQL servers with 8.0.x version
numbers:

```ini
[mysqld-8.0]
sql_mode=TRADITIONAL
```

##### Option File Inclusions

It is possible to use `!include` directives
in option files to include other option files and
`!includedir` to search specific directories
for option files. For example, to include the
`/home/mydir/myopt.cnf` file, use the
following directive:

```ini
!include /home/mydir/myopt.cnf
```

To search the `/home/mydir` directory and
read option files found there, use this directive:

```ini
!includedir /home/mydir
```

MySQL makes no guarantee about the order in which option files
in the directory are read.

Note

Any files to be found and included using the
`!includedir` directive on Unix operating
systems *must* have file names ending in
`.cnf`. On Windows, this directive checks
for files with the `.ini` or
`.cnf` extension.

Write the contents of an included option file like any other
option file. That is, it should contain groups of options,
each preceded by a
`[group]` line
that indicates the program to which the options apply.

While an included file is being processed, only those options
in groups that the current program is looking for are used.
Other groups are ignored. Suppose that a
`my.cnf` file contains this line:

```ini
!include /home/mydir/myopt.cnf
```

And suppose that `/home/mydir/myopt.cnf`
looks like this:

```ini
[mysqladmin]
force

[mysqld]
key_buffer_size=16M
```

If `my.cnf` is processed by
[**mysqld**](mysqld.md "6.3.1 mysqld — The MySQL Server"), only the
`[mysqld]` group in
`/home/mydir/myopt.cnf` is used. If the
file is processed by [**mysqladmin**](mysqladmin.md "6.5.2 mysqladmin — A MySQL Server Administration Program"), only the
`[mysqladmin]` group is used. If the file is
processed by any other program, no options in
`/home/mydir/myopt.cnf` are used.

The `!includedir` directive is processed
similarly except that all option files in the named directory
are read.

If an option file contains `!include` or
`!includedir` directives, files named by
those directives are processed whenever the option file is
processed, no matter where they appear in the file.

For inclusion directives to work, the file path should not be
specified within quotes and should have no escape sequences.
For example, the following statements provided in
`my.ini` read the option file
`myopts.ini`:

```ini
!include C:/ProgramData/MySQL/MySQL Server/myopts.ini
!include C:\ProgramData\MySQL\MySQL Server\myopts.ini
!include C:\\ProgramData\\MySQL\\MySQL Server\\myopts.ini
```

On Windows, if `!include
/path/to/extra.ini` is the
last line in the file, make sure that a newline is appended at
the end; otherwise, the line is ignored.
