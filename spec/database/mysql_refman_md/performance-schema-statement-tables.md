### 29.12.6 Performance Schema Statement Event Tables

[29.12.6.1 The events\_statements\_current Table](performance-schema-events-statements-current-table.md)

[29.12.6.2 The events\_statements\_history Table](performance-schema-events-statements-history-table.md)

[29.12.6.3 The events\_statements\_history\_long Table](performance-schema-events-statements-history-long-table.md)

[29.12.6.4 The prepared\_statements\_instances Table](performance-schema-prepared-statements-instances-table.md)

The Performance Schema instruments statement execution.
Statement events occur at a high level of the event hierarchy.
Within the event hierarchy, wait events nest within stage
events, which nest within statement events, which nest within
transaction events.

These tables store statement events:

- [`events_statements_current`](performance-schema-events-statements-current-table.md "29.12.6.1 The events_statements_current Table"): The
  current statement event for each thread.
- [`events_statements_history`](performance-schema-events-statements-history-table.md "29.12.6.2 The events_statements_history Table"): The
  most recent statement events that have ended per thread.
- [`events_statements_history_long`](performance-schema-events-statements-history-long-table.md "29.12.6.3 The events_statements_history_long Table"):
  The most recent statement events that have ended globally
  (across all threads).
- [`prepared_statements_instances`](performance-schema-prepared-statements-instances-table.md "29.12.6.4 The prepared_statements_instances Table"):
  Prepared statement instances and statistics

The following sections describe the statement event tables.
There are also summary tables that aggregate information about
statement events; see
[Section 29.12.20.3, “Statement Summary Tables”](performance-schema-statement-summary-tables.md "29.12.20.3 Statement Summary Tables").

For more information about the relationship between the three
`events_statements_xxx`
event tables, see

#### Configuring Statement Event Collection

To control whether to collect statement events, set the state of
the relevant instruments and consumers:

- The [`setup_instruments`](performance-schema-setup-instruments-table.md "29.12.2.3 The setup_instruments Table") table
  contains instruments with names that begin with
  `statement`. Use these instruments to
  enable or disable collection of individual statement event
  classes.
- The [`setup_consumers`](performance-schema-setup-consumers-table.md "29.12.2.2 The setup_consumers Table") table
  contains consumer values with names corresponding to the
  current and historical statement event table names, and the
  statement digest consumer. Use these consumers to filter
  collection of statement events and statement digesting.

The statement instruments are enabled by default, and the
`events_statements_current`,
`events_statements_history`, and
`statements_digest` statement consumers are
enabled by default:

```sql
mysql> SELECT NAME, ENABLED, TIMED
       FROM performance_schema.setup_instruments
       WHERE NAME LIKE 'statement/%';
+---------------------------------------------+---------+-------+
| NAME                                        | ENABLED | TIMED |
+---------------------------------------------+---------+-------+
| statement/sql/select                        | YES     | YES   |
| statement/sql/create_table                  | YES     | YES   |
| statement/sql/create_index                  | YES     | YES   |
...
| statement/sp/stmt                           | YES     | YES   |
| statement/sp/set                            | YES     | YES   |
| statement/sp/set_trigger_field              | YES     | YES   |
| statement/scheduler/event                   | YES     | YES   |
| statement/com/Sleep                         | YES     | YES   |
| statement/com/Quit                          | YES     | YES   |
| statement/com/Init DB                       | YES     | YES   |
...
| statement/abstract/Query                    | YES     | YES   |
| statement/abstract/new_packet               | YES     | YES   |
| statement/abstract/relay_log                | YES     | YES   |
+---------------------------------------------+---------+-------+
```

```sql
mysql> SELECT *
       FROM performance_schema.setup_consumers
       WHERE NAME LIKE '%statements%';
+--------------------------------+---------+
| NAME                           | ENABLED |
+--------------------------------+---------+
| events_statements_current      | YES     |
| events_statements_history      | YES     |
| events_statements_history_long | NO      |
| statements_digest              | YES     |
+--------------------------------+---------+
```

To control statement event collection at server startup, use
lines like these in your `my.cnf` file:

- Enable:

  ```ini
  [mysqld]
  performance-schema-instrument='statement/%=ON'
  performance-schema-consumer-events-statements-current=ON
  performance-schema-consumer-events-statements-history=ON
  performance-schema-consumer-events-statements-history-long=ON
  performance-schema-consumer-statements-digest=ON
  ```
- Disable:

  ```ini
  [mysqld]
  performance-schema-instrument='statement/%=OFF'
  performance-schema-consumer-events-statements-current=OFF
  performance-schema-consumer-events-statements-history=OFF
  performance-schema-consumer-events-statements-history-long=OFF
  performance-schema-consumer-statements-digest=OFF
  ```

To control statement event collection at runtime, update the
[`setup_instruments`](performance-schema-setup-instruments-table.md "29.12.2.3 The setup_instruments Table") and
[`setup_consumers`](performance-schema-setup-consumers-table.md "29.12.2.2 The setup_consumers Table") tables:

- Enable:

  ```sql
  UPDATE performance_schema.setup_instruments
  SET ENABLED = 'YES', TIMED = 'YES'
  WHERE NAME LIKE 'statement/%';

  UPDATE performance_schema.setup_consumers
  SET ENABLED = 'YES'
  WHERE NAME LIKE '%statements%';
  ```
- Disable:

  ```sql
  UPDATE performance_schema.setup_instruments
  SET ENABLED = 'NO', TIMED = 'NO'
  WHERE NAME LIKE 'statement/%';

  UPDATE performance_schema.setup_consumers
  SET ENABLED = 'NO'
  WHERE NAME LIKE '%statements%';
  ```

To collect only specific statement events, enable only the
corresponding statement instruments. To collect statement events
only for specific statement event tables, enable the statement
instruments but only the statement consumers corresponding to
the desired tables.

For additional information about configuring event collection,
see [Section 29.3, “Performance Schema Startup Configuration”](performance-schema-startup-configuration.md "29.3 Performance Schema Startup Configuration"),
and [Section 29.4, “Performance Schema Runtime Configuration”](performance-schema-runtime-configuration.md "29.4 Performance Schema Runtime Configuration").

#### Statement Monitoring

Statement monitoring begins from the moment the server sees that
activity is requested on a thread, to the moment when all
activity has ceased. Typically, this means from the time the
server gets the first packet from the client to the time the
server has finished sending the response. Statements within
stored programs are monitored like other statements.

When the Performance Schema instruments a request (server
command or SQL statement), it uses instrument names that proceed
in stages from more general (or “abstract”) to more
specific until it arrives at a final instrument name.

Final instrument names correspond to server commands and SQL
statements:

- Server commands correspond to the
  `COM_xxx codes`
  defined in the `mysql_com.h` header file
  and processed in `sql/sql_parse.cc`.
  Examples are `COM_PING` and
  `COM_QUIT`. Instruments for commands have
  names that begin with `statement/com`, such
  as `statement/com/Ping` and
  `statement/com/Quit`.
- SQL statements are expressed as text, such as
  `DELETE FROM t1` or `SELECT * FROM
  t2`. Instruments for SQL statements have names that
  begin with `statement/sql`, such as
  `statement/sql/delete` and
  `statement/sql/select`.

Some final instrument names are specific to error handling:

- `statement/com/Error` accounts for messages
  received by the server that are out of band. It can be used
  to detect commands sent by clients that the server does not
  understand. This may be helpful for purposes such as
  identifying clients that are misconfigured or using a
  version of MySQL more recent than that of the server, or
  clients that are attempting to attack the server.
- `statement/sql/error` accounts for SQL
  statements that fail to parse. It can be used to detect
  malformed queries sent by clients. A query that fails to
  parse differs from a query that parses but fails due to an
  error during execution. For example, `SELECT *
  FROM` is malformed, and the
  `statement/sql/error` instrument is used.
  By contrast, `SELECT *` parses but fails
  with a `No tables used` error. In this
  case, `statement/sql/select` is used and
  the statement event contains information to indicate the
  nature of the error.

A request can be obtained from any of these sources:

- As a command or statement request from a client, which sends
  the request as packets
- As a statement string read from the relay log on a replica
- As an event from the Event Scheduler

The details for a request are not initially known and the
Performance Schema proceeds from abstract to specific instrument
names in a sequence that depends on the source of the request.

For a request received from a client:

1. When the server detects a new packet at the socket level, a
   new statement is started with an abstract instrument name of
   `statement/abstract/new_packet`.
2. When the server reads the packet number, it knows more about
   the type of request received, and the Performance Schema
   refines the instrument name. For example, if the request is
   a `COM_PING` packet, the instrument name
   becomes `statement/com/Ping` and that is
   the final name. If the request is a
   `COM_QUERY` packet, it is known to
   correspond to an SQL statement but not the particular type
   of statement. In this case, the instrument changes from one
   abstract name to a more specific but still abstract name,
   `statement/abstract/Query`, and the request
   requires further classification.
3. If the request is a statement, the statement text is read
   and given to the parser. After parsing, the exact statement
   type is known. If the request is, for example, an
   [`INSERT`](insert.md "15.2.7 INSERT Statement") statement, the
   Performance Schema refines the instrument name from
   `statement/abstract/Query` to
   `statement/sql/insert`, which is the final
   name.

For a request read as a statement from the relay log on a
replica:

1. Statements in the relay log are stored as text and are read
   as such. There is no network protocol, so the
   `statement/abstract/new_packet` instrument
   is not used. Instead, the initial instrument is
   `statement/abstract/relay_log`.
2. When the statement is parsed, the exact statement type is
   known. If the request is, for example, an
   [`INSERT`](insert.md "15.2.7 INSERT Statement") statement, the
   Performance Schema refines the instrument name from
   `statement/abstract/Query` to
   `statement/sql/insert`, which is the final
   name.

The preceding description applies only for statement-based
replication. For row-based replication, table I/O done on the
replica as it processes row changes can be instrumented, but row
events in the relay log do not appear as discrete statements.

For a request received from the Event Scheduler:

The event execution is instrumented using the name
`statement/scheduler/event`. This is the final
name.

Statements executed within the event body are instrumented using
`statement/sql/*` names, without use of any
preceding abstract instrument. An event is a stored program, and
stored programs are precompiled in memory before execution.
Consequently, there is no parsing at runtime and the type of
each statement is known by the time it executes.

Statements executed within the event body are child statements.
For example, if an event executes an
[`INSERT`](insert.md "15.2.7 INSERT Statement") statement, execution of
the event itself is the parent, instrumented using
`statement/scheduler/event`, and the
[`INSERT`](insert.md "15.2.7 INSERT Statement") is the child, instrumented
using `statement/sql/insert`. The parent/child
relationship holds *between* separate
instrumented operations. This differs from the sequence of
refinement that occurs *within* a single
instrumented operation, from abstract to final instrument names.

For statistics to be collected for statements, it is not
sufficient to enable only the final
`statement/sql/*` instruments used for
individual statement types. The abstract
`statement/abstract/*` instruments must be
enabled as well. This should not normally be an issue because
all statement instruments are enabled by default. However, an
application that enables or disables statement instruments
selectively must take into account that disabling abstract
instruments also disables statistics collection for the
individual statement instruments. For example, to collect
statistics for [`INSERT`](insert.md "15.2.7 INSERT Statement") statements,
`statement/sql/insert` must be enabled, but
also `statement/abstract/new_packet` and
`statement/abstract/Query`. Similarly, for
replicated statements to be instrumented,
`statement/abstract/relay_log` must be enabled.

No statistics are aggregated for abstract instruments such as
`statement/abstract/Query` because no statement
is ever classified with an abstract instrument as the final
statement name.
