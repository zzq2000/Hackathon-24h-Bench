## 17.10 InnoDB Row Formats

The row format of a table determines how its rows are physically
stored, which in turn can affect the performance of queries and DML
operations. As more rows fit into a single disk page, queries and
index lookups can work faster, less cache memory is required in the
buffer pool, and less I/O is required to write out updated values.

The data in each table is divided into pages. The pages that make up
each table are arranged in a tree data structure called a B-tree
index. Table data and secondary indexes both use this type of
structure. The B-tree index that represents an entire table is known
as the clustered index, which is organized according to the primary
key columns. The nodes of a clustered index data structure contain
the values of all columns in the row. The nodes of a secondary index
structure contain the values of index columns and primary key
columns.

Variable-length columns are an exception to the rule that column
values are stored in B-tree index nodes. Variable-length columns
that are too long to fit on a B-tree page are stored on separately
allocated disk pages called overflow pages. Such columns are
referred to as off-page columns. The values of off-page columns are
stored in singly-linked lists of overflow pages, with each such
column having its own list of one or more overflow pages. Depending
on column length, all or a prefix of variable-length column values
are stored in the B-tree to avoid wasting storage and having to read
a separate page.

The `InnoDB` storage engine supports four row
formats: `REDUNDANT`, `COMPACT`,
`DYNAMIC`, and `COMPRESSED`.

**Table 17.15 InnoDB Row Format Overview**

| Row Format | Compact Storage Characteristics | Enhanced Variable-Length Column Storage | Large Index Key Prefix Support | Compression Support | Supported Tablespace Types |

### REDUNDANT Row Format

The `REDUNDANT` format provides compatibility
with older versions of MySQL.

Tables that use the `REDUNDANT` row format store
the first 768 bytes of variable-length column values
([`VARCHAR`](char.md "13.3.2 The CHAR and VARCHAR Types"),
[`VARBINARY`](binary-varbinary.md "13.3.3 The BINARY and VARBINARY Types"), and
[`BLOB`](blob.md "13.3.4 The BLOB and TEXT Types") and
[`TEXT`](blob.md "13.3.4 The BLOB and TEXT Types") types) in the index record
within the B-tree node, with the remainder stored on overflow
pages. Fixed-length columns greater than or equal to 768 bytes are
encoded as variable-length columns, which can be stored off-page.
For example, a `CHAR(255)` column can exceed 768
bytes if the maximum byte length of the character set is greater
than 3, as it is with `utf8mb4`.

If the value of a column is 768 bytes or less, an overflow page is
not used, and some savings in I/O may result, since the value is
stored entirely in the B-tree node. This works well for relatively
short `BLOB` column values, but may cause B-tree
nodes to fill with data rather than key values, reducing their
efficiency. Tables with many `BLOB` columns could
cause B-tree nodes to become too full, and contain too few rows,
making the entire index less efficient than if rows were shorter
or column values were stored off-page.

#### REDUNDANT Row Format Storage Characteristics

The `REDUNDANT` row format has the following
storage characteristics:

- Each index record contains a 6-byte header. The header is used
  to link together consecutive records, and for row-level
  locking.
- Records in the clustered index contain fields for all
  user-defined columns. In addition, there is a 6-byte
  transaction ID field and a 7-byte roll pointer field.
- If no primary key is defined for a table, each clustered index
  record also contains a 6-byte row ID field.
- Each secondary index record contains all the primary key
  columns defined for the clustered index key that are not in
  the secondary index.
- A record contains a pointer to each field of the record. If
  the total length of the fields in a record is less than 128
  bytes, the pointer is one byte; otherwise, two bytes. The
  array of pointers is called the record directory. The area
  where the pointers point is the data part of the record.
- Internally, fixed-length character columns such as
  [`CHAR(10)`](char.md "13.3.2 The CHAR and VARCHAR Types") in stored in
  fixed-length format. Trailing spaces are not truncated from
  [`VARCHAR`](char.md "13.3.2 The CHAR and VARCHAR Types") columns.
- Fixed-length columns greater than or equal to 768 bytes are
  encoded as variable-length columns, which can be stored
  off-page. For example, a `CHAR(255)` column
  can exceed 768 bytes if the maximum byte length of the
  character set is greater than 3, as it is with
  `utf8mb4`.
- An SQL `NULL` value reserves one or two bytes
  in the record directory. An SQL `NULL` value
  reserves zero bytes in the data part of the record if stored
  in a variable-length column. For a fixed-length column, the
  fixed length of the column is reserved in the data part of the
  record. Reserving fixed space for `NULL`
  values permits columns to be updated in place from
  `NULL` to non-`NULL` values
  without causing index page fragmentation.

### COMPACT Row Format

The `COMPACT` row format reduces row storage
space by about 20% compared to the `REDUNDANT`
row format, at the cost of increasing CPU use for some operations.
If your workload is a typical one that is limited by cache hit
rates and disk speed, `COMPACT` format is likely
to be faster. If the workload is limited by CPU speed, compact
format might be slower.

Tables that use the `COMPACT` row format store
the first 768 bytes of variable-length column values
([`VARCHAR`](char.md "13.3.2 The CHAR and VARCHAR Types"),
[`VARBINARY`](binary-varbinary.md "13.3.3 The BINARY and VARBINARY Types"), and
[`BLOB`](blob.md "13.3.4 The BLOB and TEXT Types") and
[`TEXT`](blob.md "13.3.4 The BLOB and TEXT Types") types) in the index record
within the [B-tree](glossary.md#glos_b_tree "B-tree") node, with
the remainder stored on overflow pages. Fixed-length columns
greater than or equal to 768 bytes are encoded as variable-length
columns, which can be stored off-page. For example, a
`CHAR(255)` column can exceed 768 bytes if the
maximum byte length of the character set is greater than 3, as it
is with `utf8mb4`.

If the value of a column is 768 bytes or less, an overflow page is
not used, and some savings in I/O may result, since the value is
stored entirely in the B-tree node. This works well for relatively
short `BLOB` column values, but may cause B-tree
nodes to fill with data rather than key values, reducing their
efficiency. Tables with many `BLOB` columns could
cause B-tree nodes to become too full, and contain too few rows,
making the entire index less efficient than if rows were shorter
or column values were stored off-page.

#### COMPACT Row Format Storage Characteristics

The `COMPACT` row format has the following
storage characteristics:

- Each index record contains a 5-byte header that may be
  preceded by a variable-length header. The header is used to
  link together consecutive records, and for row-level locking.
- The variable-length part of the record header contains a bit
  vector for indicating `NULL` columns. If the
  number of columns in the index that can be
  `NULL` is *`N`*, the
  bit vector occupies
  `CEILING(N/8)`
  bytes. (For example, if there are anywhere from 9 to 16
  columns that can be `NULL`, the bit vector
  uses two bytes.) Columns that are `NULL` do
  not occupy space other than the bit in this vector. The
  variable-length part of the header also contains the lengths
  of variable-length columns. Each length takes one or two
  bytes, depending on the maximum length of the column. If all
  columns in the index are `NOT NULL` and have
  a fixed length, the record header has no variable-length part.
- For each non-`NULL` variable-length field,
  the record header contains the length of the column in one or
  two bytes. Two bytes are only needed if part of the column is
  stored externally in overflow pages or the maximum length
  exceeds 255 bytes and the actual length exceeds 127 bytes. For
  an externally stored column, the 2-byte length indicates the
  length of the internally stored part plus the 20-byte pointer
  to the externally stored part. The internal part is 768 bytes,
  so the length is 768+20. The 20-byte pointer stores the true
  length of the column.
- The record header is followed by the data contents of
  non-`NULL` columns.
- Records in the clustered index contain fields for all
  user-defined columns. In addition, there is a 6-byte
  transaction ID field and a 7-byte roll pointer field.
- If no primary key is defined for a table, each clustered index
  record also contains a 6-byte row ID field.
- Each secondary index record contains all the primary key
  columns defined for the clustered index key that are not in
  the secondary index. If any of the primary key columns are
  variable length, the record header for each secondary index
  has a variable-length part to record their lengths, even if
  the secondary index is defined on fixed-length columns.
- Internally, for nonvariable-length character sets,
  fixed-length character columns such as
  [`CHAR(10)`](char.md "13.3.2 The CHAR and VARCHAR Types") are stored in a
  fixed-length format.

  Trailing spaces are not truncated from
  [`VARCHAR`](char.md "13.3.2 The CHAR and VARCHAR Types") columns.
- Internally, for variable-length character sets such as
  `utf8mb3` and `utf8mb4`,
  `InnoDB` attempts to store
  [`CHAR(N)`](char.md "13.3.2 The CHAR and VARCHAR Types")
  in *`N`* bytes by trimming trailing
  spaces. If the byte length of a
  [`CHAR(N)`](char.md "13.3.2 The CHAR and VARCHAR Types")
  column value exceeds *`N`* bytes,
  trailing spaces are trimmed to a maximum of the column value
  byte length. The maximum length of a
  [`CHAR(N)`](char.md "13.3.2 The CHAR and VARCHAR Types")
  column is the maximum character byte length ×
  *`N`*.

  A minimum of *`N`* bytes is reserved
  for
  [`CHAR(N)`](char.md "13.3.2 The CHAR and VARCHAR Types").
  Reserving the minimum space *`N`* in
  many cases enables column updates to be done in place without
  causing index page fragmentation. By comparison,
  [`CHAR(N)`](char.md "13.3.2 The CHAR and VARCHAR Types")
  columns occupy the maximum character byte length ×
  *`N`* when using the
  `REDUNDANT` row format.

  Fixed-length columns greater than or equal to 768 bytes are
  encoded as variable-length fields, which can be stored
  off-page. For example, a `CHAR(255)` column
  can exceed 768 bytes if the maximum byte length of the
  character set is greater than 3, as it is with
  `utf8mb4`.

### DYNAMIC Row Format

The `DYNAMIC` row format offers the same storage
characteristics as the `COMPACT` row format but
adds enhanced storage capabilities for long variable-length
columns and supports large index key prefixes.

When a table is created with
`ROW_FORMAT=DYNAMIC`, `InnoDB`
can store long variable-length column values (for
[`VARCHAR`](char.md "13.3.2 The CHAR and VARCHAR Types"),
[`VARBINARY`](binary-varbinary.md "13.3.3 The BINARY and VARBINARY Types"), and
[`BLOB`](blob.md "13.3.4 The BLOB and TEXT Types") and
[`TEXT`](blob.md "13.3.4 The BLOB and TEXT Types") types) fully off-page, with
the clustered index record containing only a 20-byte pointer to
the overflow page. Fixed-length fields greater than or equal to
768 bytes are encoded as variable-length fields. For example, a
`CHAR(255)` column can exceed 768 bytes if the
maximum byte length of the character set is greater than 3, as it
is with `utf8mb4`.

Whether columns are stored off-page depends on the page size and
the total size of the row. When a row is too long, the longest
columns are chosen for off-page storage until the clustered index
record fits on the [B-tree](glossary.md#glos_b_tree "B-tree") page.
[`TEXT`](blob.md "13.3.4 The BLOB and TEXT Types") and
[`BLOB`](blob.md "13.3.4 The BLOB and TEXT Types") columns that are less than or
equal to 40 bytes are stored in line.

The `DYNAMIC` row format maintains the efficiency
of storing the entire row in the index node if it fits (as do the
`COMPACT` and `REDUNDANT`
formats), but the `DYNAMIC` row format avoids the
problem of filling B-tree nodes with a large number of data bytes
of long columns. The `DYNAMIC` row format is
based on the idea that if a portion of a long data value is stored
off-page, it is usually most efficient to store the entire value
off-page. With `DYNAMIC` format, shorter columns
are likely to remain in the B-tree node, minimizing the number of
overflow pages required for a given row.

The `DYNAMIC` row format supports index key
prefixes up to 3072 bytes.

Tables that use the `DYNAMIC` row format can be
stored in the system tablespace, file-per-table tablespaces, and
general tablespaces. To store `DYNAMIC` tables in
the system tablespace, either disable
[`innodb_file_per_table`](innodb-parameters.md#sysvar_innodb_file_per_table) and use a
regular `CREATE TABLE` or `ALTER
TABLE` statement, or use the `TABLESPACE [=]
innodb_system` table option with `CREATE
TABLE` or `ALTER TABLE`. The
[`innodb_file_per_table`](innodb-parameters.md#sysvar_innodb_file_per_table) variable is
not applicable to general tablespaces, nor is it applicable when
using the `TABLESPACE [=] innodb_system` table
option to store `DYNAMIC` tables in the system
tablespace.

#### DYNAMIC Row Format Storage Characteristics

The `DYNAMIC` row format is a variation of the
`COMPACT` row format. For storage
characteristics, see
[COMPACT Row Format Storage Characteristics](innodb-row-format.md#innodb-compact-row-format-characteristics "COMPACT Row Format Storage Characteristics").

### COMPRESSED Row Format

The `COMPRESSED` row format offers the same
storage characteristics and capabilities as the
`DYNAMIC` row format but adds support for table
and index data compression.

The `COMPRESSED` row format uses similar internal
details for off-page storage as the `DYNAMIC` row
format, with additional storage and performance considerations
from the table and index data being compressed and using smaller
page sizes. With the `COMPRESSED` row format, the
`KEY_BLOCK_SIZE` option controls how much column
data is stored in the clustered index, and how much is placed on
overflow pages. For more information about the
`COMPRESSED` row format, see
[Section 17.9, “InnoDB Table and Page Compression”](innodb-compression.md "17.9 InnoDB Table and Page Compression").

The `COMPRESSED` row format supports index key
prefixes up to 3072 bytes.

Tables that use the `COMPRESSED` row format can
be created in file-per-table tablespaces or general tablespaces.
The system tablespace does not support the
`COMPRESSED` row format. To store a
`COMPRESSED` table in a file-per-table
tablespace, the
[`innodb_file_per_table`](innodb-parameters.md#sysvar_innodb_file_per_table) variable
must be enabled. The
[`innodb_file_per_table`](innodb-parameters.md#sysvar_innodb_file_per_table) variable is
not applicable to general tablespaces. General tablespaces support
all row formats with the caveat that compressed and uncompressed
tables cannot coexist in the same general tablespace due to
different physical page sizes. For more information, see
[Section 17.6.3.3, “General Tablespaces”](general-tablespaces.md "17.6.3.3 General Tablespaces").

#### Compressed Row Format Storage Characteristics

The `COMPRESSED` row format is a variation of the
`COMPACT` row format. For storage
characteristics, see
[COMPACT Row Format Storage Characteristics](innodb-row-format.md#innodb-compact-row-format-characteristics "COMPACT Row Format Storage Characteristics").

### Defining the Row Format of a Table

The default row format for `InnoDB` tables is
defined by
[`innodb_default_row_format`](innodb-parameters.md#sysvar_innodb_default_row_format)
variable, which has a default value of `DYNAMIC`.
The default row format is used when the
`ROW_FORMAT` table option is not defined
explicitly or when `ROW_FORMAT=DEFAULT` is
specified.

The row format of a table can be defined explicitly using the
`ROW_FORMAT` table option in a
[`CREATE TABLE`](create-table.md "15.1.20 CREATE TABLE Statement") or
[`ALTER TABLE`](alter-table.md "15.1.9 ALTER TABLE Statement") statement. For example:

```sql
CREATE TABLE t1 (c1 INT) ROW_FORMAT=DYNAMIC;
```

An explicitly defined `ROW_FORMAT` setting
overrides the default row format. Specifying
`ROW_FORMAT=DEFAULT` is equivalent to using the
implicit default.

The [`innodb_default_row_format`](innodb-parameters.md#sysvar_innodb_default_row_format)
variable can be set dynamically:

```sql
mysql> SET GLOBAL innodb_default_row_format=DYNAMIC;
```

Valid [`innodb_default_row_format`](innodb-parameters.md#sysvar_innodb_default_row_format)
options include `DYNAMIC`,
`COMPACT`, and `REDUNDANT`. The
`COMPRESSED` row format, which is not supported
for use in the system tablespace, cannot be defined as the
default. It can only be specified explicitly in a
[`CREATE TABLE`](create-table.md "15.1.20 CREATE TABLE Statement") or
[`ALTER TABLE`](alter-table.md "15.1.9 ALTER TABLE Statement") statement. Attempting
to set the
[`innodb_default_row_format`](innodb-parameters.md#sysvar_innodb_default_row_format)
variable to `COMPRESSED` returns an error:

```sql
mysql> SET GLOBAL innodb_default_row_format=COMPRESSED;
ERROR 1231 (42000): Variable 'innodb_default_row_format'
can't be set to the value of 'COMPRESSED'
```

Newly created tables use the row format defined by the
[`innodb_default_row_format`](innodb-parameters.md#sysvar_innodb_default_row_format)
variable when a `ROW_FORMAT` option is not
specified explicitly, or when
`ROW_FORMAT=DEFAULT` is used. For example, the
following [`CREATE TABLE`](create-table.md "15.1.20 CREATE TABLE Statement") statements
use the row format defined by the
[`innodb_default_row_format`](innodb-parameters.md#sysvar_innodb_default_row_format)
variable.

```sql
CREATE TABLE t1 (c1 INT);
```

```sql
CREATE TABLE t2 (c1 INT) ROW_FORMAT=DEFAULT;
```

When a `ROW_FORMAT` option is not specified
explicitly, or when `ROW_FORMAT=DEFAULT` is used,
an operation that rebuilds a table silently changes the row format
of the table to the format defined by the
[`innodb_default_row_format`](innodb-parameters.md#sysvar_innodb_default_row_format)
variable.

Table-rebuilding operations include [`ALTER
TABLE`](alter-table.md "15.1.9 ALTER TABLE Statement") operations that use
`ALGORITHM=COPY` or
`ALGORITHM=INPLACE` where table rebuilding is
required. See [Section 17.12.1, “Online DDL Operations”](innodb-online-ddl-operations.md "17.12.1 Online DDL Operations") for
more information. [`OPTIMIZE TABLE`](optimize-table.md "15.7.3.4 OPTIMIZE TABLE Statement") is
also a table-rebuilding operation.

The following example demonstrates a table-rebuilding operation
that silently changes the row format of a table created without an
explicitly defined row format.

```sql
mysql> SELECT @@innodb_default_row_format;
+-----------------------------+
| @@innodb_default_row_format |
+-----------------------------+
| dynamic                     |
+-----------------------------+

mysql> CREATE TABLE t1 (c1 INT);

mysql> SELECT * FROM INFORMATION_SCHEMA.INNODB_TABLES WHERE NAME LIKE 'test/t1' \G
*************************** 1. row ***************************
     TABLE_ID: 54
         NAME: test/t1
         FLAG: 33
       N_COLS: 4
        SPACE: 35
   ROW_FORMAT: Dynamic
ZIP_PAGE_SIZE: 0
   SPACE_TYPE: Single

mysql> SET GLOBAL innodb_default_row_format=COMPACT;

mysql> ALTER TABLE t1 ADD COLUMN (c2 INT);

mysql> SELECT * FROM INFORMATION_SCHEMA.INNODB_TABLES WHERE NAME LIKE 'test/t1' \G
*************************** 1. row ***************************
     TABLE_ID: 55
         NAME: test/t1
         FLAG: 1
       N_COLS: 5
        SPACE: 36
   ROW_FORMAT: Compact
ZIP_PAGE_SIZE: 0
   SPACE_TYPE: Single
```

Consider the following potential issues before changing the row
format of existing tables from `REDUNDANT` or
`COMPACT` to `DYNAMIC`.

- The `REDUNDANT` and
  `COMPACT` row formats support a maximum index
  key prefix length of 767 bytes whereas
  `DYNAMIC` and `COMPRESSED`
  row formats support an index key prefix length of 3072 bytes.
  In a replication environment, if the
  [`innodb_default_row_format`](innodb-parameters.md#sysvar_innodb_default_row_format)
  variable is set to `DYNAMIC` on the source,
  and set to `COMPACT` on the replica, the
  following DDL statement, which does not explicitly define a
  row format, succeeds on the source but fails on the replica:

  ```sql
  CREATE TABLE t1 (c1 INT PRIMARY KEY, c2 VARCHAR(5000), KEY i1(c2(3070)));
  ```

  For related information, see [Section 17.22, “InnoDB Limits”](innodb-limits.md "17.22 InnoDB Limits").
- Importing a table that does not explicitly define a row format
  results in a schema mismatch error if the
  [`innodb_default_row_format`](innodb-parameters.md#sysvar_innodb_default_row_format)
  setting on the source server differs from the setting on the
  destination server. For more information, see
  [Section 17.6.1.3, “Importing InnoDB Tables”](innodb-table-import.md "17.6.1.3 Importing InnoDB Tables").

### Determining the Row Format of a Table

To determine the row format of a table, use
[`SHOW TABLE STATUS`](show-table-status.md "15.7.7.38 SHOW TABLE STATUS Statement"):

```sql
mysql> SHOW TABLE STATUS IN test1\G
*************************** 1. row ***************************
           Name: t1
         Engine: InnoDB
        Version: 10
     Row_format: Dynamic
           Rows: 0
 Avg_row_length: 0
    Data_length: 16384
Max_data_length: 0
   Index_length: 16384
      Data_free: 0
 Auto_increment: 1
    Create_time: 2016-09-14 16:29:38
    Update_time: NULL
     Check_time: NULL
      Collation: utf8mb4_0900_ai_ci
       Checksum: NULL
 Create_options:
        Comment:
```

Alternatively, query the Information Schema
[`INNODB_TABLES`](information-schema-innodb-tables-table.md "28.4.23 The INFORMATION_SCHEMA INNODB_TABLES Table") table:

```sql
mysql> SELECT NAME, ROW_FORMAT FROM INFORMATION_SCHEMA.INNODB_TABLES WHERE NAME='test1/t1';
+----------+------------+
| NAME     | ROW_FORMAT |
+----------+------------+
| test1/t1 | Dynamic    |
+----------+------------+
```
