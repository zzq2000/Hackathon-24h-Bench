### 17.12.6 Simplifying DDL Statements with Online DDL

Before the introduction of [online
DDL](glossary.md#glos_online_ddl "online DDL"), it was common practice to combine many DDL operations
into a single [`ALTER TABLE`](alter-table.md "15.1.9 ALTER TABLE Statement")
statement. Because each [`ALTER TABLE`](alter-table.md "15.1.9 ALTER TABLE Statement")
statement involved copying and rebuilding the table, it was more
efficient to make several changes to the same table at once, since
those changes could all be done with a single rebuild operation
for the table. The downside was that SQL code involving DDL
operations was harder to maintain and to reuse in different
scripts. If the specific changes were different each time, you
might have to construct a new complex [`ALTER
TABLE`](alter-table.md "15.1.9 ALTER TABLE Statement") for each slightly different scenario.

For DDL operations that can be done online, you can separate them
into individual [`ALTER TABLE`](alter-table.md "15.1.9 ALTER TABLE Statement")
statements for easier scripting and maintenance, without
sacrificing efficiency. For example, you might take a complicated
statement such as:

```sql
ALTER TABLE t1 ADD INDEX i1(c1), ADD UNIQUE INDEX i2(c2),
  CHANGE c4_old_name c4_new_name INTEGER UNSIGNED;
```

and break it down into simpler parts that can be tested and
performed independently, such as:

```sql
ALTER TABLE t1 ADD INDEX i1(c1);
ALTER TABLE t1 ADD UNIQUE INDEX i2(c2);
ALTER TABLE t1 CHANGE c4_old_name c4_new_name INTEGER UNSIGNED NOT NULL;
```

You might still use multi-part [`ALTER
TABLE`](alter-table.md "15.1.9 ALTER TABLE Statement") statements for:

- Operations that must be performed in a specific sequence, such
  as creating an index followed by a foreign key constraint that
  uses that index.
- Operations all using the same specific `LOCK`
  clause, that you want to either succeed or fail as a group.
- Operations that cannot be performed online, that is, that
  still use the table-copy method.
- Operations for which you specify
  `ALGORITHM=COPY` or
  [`old_alter_table=1`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_old_alter_table), to force
  the table-copying behavior if needed for precise
  backward-compatibility in specialized scenarios.
