### 10.15.16 Optimizer Trace Implementation

See the files `sql/opt_trace*`, starting with
`sql/opt_trace.h`. A trace is started by
creating an instance of `Opt_trace_start`;
information is added to this trace by creating instances of
`Opt_trace_object` and
`Opt_trace_array`, and by using the
`add()` methods of these classes.
