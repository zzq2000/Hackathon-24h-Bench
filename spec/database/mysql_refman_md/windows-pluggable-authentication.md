#### 8.4.1.6 Windows Pluggable Authentication

Note

Windows pluggable authentication is an extension included in
MySQL Enterprise Edition, a commercial product. To learn more about commercial
products, see <https://www.mysql.com/products/>.

MySQL Enterprise Edition for Windows supports an authentication method that
performs external authentication on Windows, enabling MySQL
Server to use native Windows services to authenticate client
connections. Users who have logged in to Windows can connect
from MySQL client programs to the server based on the
information in their environment without specifying an
additional password.

The client and server exchange data packets in the
authentication handshake. As a result of this exchange, the
server creates a security context object that represents the
identity of the client in the Windows OS. This identity includes
the name of the client account. Windows pluggable authentication
uses the identity of the client to check whether it is a given
account or a member of a group. By default, negotiation uses
Kerberos to authenticate, then NTLM if Kerberos is unavailable.

Windows pluggable authentication provides these capabilities:

- External authentication: Windows authentication enables
  MySQL Server to accept connections from users defined
  outside the MySQL grant tables who have logged in to
  Windows.
- Proxy user support: Windows authentication can return to
  MySQL a user name different from the external user name
  passed by the client program. This means that the plugin can
  return the MySQL user that defines the privileges the
  external Windows-authenticated user should have. For
  example, a Windows user named `joe` can
  connect and have the privileges of a MySQL user named
  `developer`.

The following table shows the plugin and library file names. The
file must be located in the directory named by the
[`plugin_dir`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_plugin_dir) system variable.

**Table 8.21 Plugin and Library Names for Windows Authentication**

| Plugin or File | Plugin or File Name |
| --- | --- |
| Server-side plugin | `authentication_windows` |
| Client-side plugin | `authentication_windows_client` |
| Library file | `authentication_windows.dll` |

The library file includes only the server-side plugin. The
client-side plugin is built into the
`libmysqlclient` client library.

The server-side Windows authentication plugin is included only
in MySQL Enterprise Edition. It is not included in MySQL community distributions.
The client-side plugin is included in all distributions,
including community distributions. This enables clients from any
distribution to connect to a server that has the server-side
plugin loaded.

The following sections provide installation and usage
information specific to Windows pluggable authentication:

- [Installing Windows Pluggable Authentication](windows-pluggable-authentication.md#windows-pluggable-authentication-installation "Installing Windows Pluggable Authentication")
- [Uninstalling Windows Pluggable Authentication](windows-pluggable-authentication.md#windows-pluggable-authentication-uninstallation "Uninstalling Windows Pluggable Authentication")
- [Using Windows Pluggable Authentication](windows-pluggable-authentication.md#windows-pluggable-authentication-usage "Using Windows Pluggable Authentication")

For general information about pluggable authentication in MySQL,
see [Section 8.2.17, “Pluggable Authentication”](pluggable-authentication.md "8.2.17 Pluggable Authentication"). For proxy user
information, see [Section 8.2.19, “Proxy Users”](proxy-users.md "8.2.19 Proxy Users").

##### Installing Windows Pluggable Authentication

This section describes how to install the server-side Windows
authentication plugin. For general information about
installing plugins, see [Section 7.6.1, “Installing and Uninstalling Plugins”](plugin-loading.md "7.6.1 Installing and Uninstalling Plugins").

To be usable by the server, the plugin library file must be
located in the MySQL plugin directory (the directory named by
the [`plugin_dir`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_plugin_dir) system
variable). If necessary, configure the plugin directory
location by setting the value of
[`plugin_dir`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_plugin_dir) at server startup.

To load the plugin at server startup, use the
[`--plugin-load-add`](server-options.md#option_mysqld_plugin-load-add) option to
name the library file that contains it. With this
plugin-loading method, the option must be given each time the
server starts. For example, put these lines in the server
`my.cnf` file:

```ini
[mysqld]
plugin-load-add=authentication_windows.dll
```

After modifying `my.cnf`, restart the
server to cause the new settings to take effect.

Alternatively, to load the plugin at runtime, use this
statement:

```sql
INSTALL PLUGIN authentication_windows SONAME 'authentication_windows.dll';
```

[`INSTALL PLUGIN`](install-plugin.md "15.7.4.4 INSTALL PLUGIN Statement") loads the plugin
immediately, and also registers it in the
`mysql.plugins` system table to cause the
server to load it for each subsequent normal startup without
the need for [`--plugin-load-add`](server-options.md#option_mysqld_plugin-load-add).

To verify plugin installation, examine the Information Schema
[`PLUGINS`](information-schema-plugins-table.md "28.3.22 The INFORMATION_SCHEMA PLUGINS Table") table or use the
[`SHOW PLUGINS`](show-plugins.md "15.7.7.25 SHOW PLUGINS Statement") statement (see
[Section 7.6.2, “Obtaining Server Plugin Information”](obtaining-plugin-information.md "7.6.2 Obtaining Server Plugin Information")). For example:

```sql
mysql> SELECT PLUGIN_NAME, PLUGIN_STATUS
       FROM INFORMATION_SCHEMA.PLUGINS
       WHERE PLUGIN_NAME LIKE '%windows%';
+------------------------+---------------+
| PLUGIN_NAME            | PLUGIN_STATUS |
+------------------------+---------------+
| authentication_windows | ACTIVE        |
+------------------------+---------------+
```

If the plugin fails to initialize, check the server error log
for diagnostic messages.

To associate MySQL accounts with the Windows authentication
plugin, see
[Using Windows Pluggable Authentication](windows-pluggable-authentication.md#windows-pluggable-authentication-usage "Using Windows Pluggable Authentication").
Additional plugin control is provided by the
[`authentication_windows_use_principal_name`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_authentication_windows_use_principal_name)
and
[`authentication_windows_log_level`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_authentication_windows_log_level)
system variables. See
[Section 7.1.8, “Server System Variables”](server-system-variables.md "7.1.8 Server System Variables").

##### Uninstalling Windows Pluggable Authentication

The method used to uninstall the Windows authentication plugin
depends on how you installed it:

- If you installed the plugin at server startup using a
  [`--plugin-load-add`](server-options.md#option_mysqld_plugin-load-add) option,
  restart the server without the option.
- If you installed the plugin at runtime using an
  [`INSTALL PLUGIN`](install-plugin.md "15.7.4.4 INSTALL PLUGIN Statement") statement,
  it remains installed across server restarts. To uninstall
  it, use [`UNINSTALL PLUGIN`](uninstall-plugin.md "15.7.4.6 UNINSTALL PLUGIN Statement"):

  ```sql
  UNINSTALL PLUGIN authentication_windows;
  ```

In addition, remove any startup options that set Windows
plugin-related system variables.

##### Using Windows Pluggable Authentication

The Windows authentication plugin supports the use of MySQL
accounts such that users who have logged in to Windows can
connect to the MySQL server without having to specify an
additional password. It is assumed that the server is running
with the server-side plugin enabled, as described in
[Installing Windows Pluggable Authentication](windows-pluggable-authentication.md#windows-pluggable-authentication-installation "Installing Windows Pluggable Authentication").
Once the DBA has enabled the server-side plugin and set up
accounts to use it, clients can connect using those accounts
with no other setup required on their part.

To refer to the Windows authentication plugin in the
`IDENTIFIED WITH` clause of a
[`CREATE USER`](create-user.md "15.7.1.3 CREATE USER Statement") statement, use the
name `authentication_windows`. Suppose that
the Windows users `Rafal` and
`Tasha` should be permitted to connect to
MySQL, as well as any users in the
`Administrators` or `Power
Users` group. To set this up, create a MySQL account
named `sql_admin` that uses the Windows
plugin for authentication:

```sql
CREATE USER sql_admin
  IDENTIFIED WITH authentication_windows
  AS 'Rafal, Tasha, Administrators, "Power Users"';
```

The plugin name is `authentication_windows`.
The string following the `AS` keyword is the
authentication string. It specifies that the Windows users
named `Rafal` or `Tasha` are
permitted to authenticate to the server as the MySQL user
`sql_admin`, as are any Windows users in the
`Administrators` or `Power
Users` group. The latter group name contains a space,
so it must be quoted with double quote characters.

After you create the `sql_admin` account, a
user who has logged in to Windows can attempt to connect to
the server using that account:

```terminal
C:\> mysql --user=sql_admin
```

No password is required here. The
`authentication_windows` plugin uses the
Windows security API to check which Windows user is
connecting. If that user is named `Rafal` or
`Tasha`, or is a member of the
`Administrators` or `Power
Users` group, the server grants access and the client
is authenticated as `sql_admin` and has
whatever privileges are granted to the
`sql_admin` account. Otherwise, the server
denies access.

Authentication string syntax for the Windows authentication
plugin follows these rules:

- The string consists of one or more user mappings separated
  by commas.
- Each user mapping associates a Windows user or group name
  with a MySQL user name:

  ```none
  win_user_or_group_name=mysql_user_name
  win_user_or_group_name
  ```

  For the latter syntax, with no
  *`mysql_user_name`* value given,
  the implicit value is the MySQL user created by the
  [`CREATE USER`](create-user.md "15.7.1.3 CREATE USER Statement") statement.
  Thus, these statements are equivalent:

  ```sql
  CREATE USER sql_admin
    IDENTIFIED WITH authentication_windows
    AS 'Rafal, Tasha, Administrators, "Power Users"';

  CREATE USER sql_admin
    IDENTIFIED WITH authentication_windows
    AS 'Rafal=sql_admin, Tasha=sql_admin, Administrators=sql_admin,
        "Power Users"=sql_admin';
  ```
- Each backslash character (`\`) in a value
  must be doubled because backslash is the escape character
  in MySQL strings.
- Leading and trailing spaces not inside double quotation
  marks are ignored.
- Unquoted *`win_user_or_group_name`*
  and *`mysql_user_name`* values can
  contain anything except equal sign, comma, or space.
- If a *`win_user_or_group_name`* and
  or *`mysql_user_name`* value is
  quoted with double quotation marks, everything between the
  quotation marks is part of the value. This is necessary,
  for example, if the name contains space characters. All
  characters within double quotes are legal except double
  quotation mark and backslash. To include either character,
  escape it with a backslash.
- *`win_user_or_group_name`* values
  use conventional syntax for Windows principals, either
  local or in a domain. Examples (note the doubling of
  backslashes):

  ```none
  domain\\user
  .\\user
  domain\\group
  .\\group
  BUILTIN\\WellKnownGroup
  ```

When invoked by the server to authenticate a client, the
plugin scans the authentication string left to right for a
user or group match to the Windows user. If there is a match,
the plugin returns the corresponding
*`mysql_user_name`* to the MySQL
server. If there is no match, authentication fails.

A user name match takes preference over a group name match.
Suppose that the Windows user named
`win_user` is a member of
`win_group` and the authentication string
looks like this:

```none
'win_group = sql_user1, win_user = sql_user2'
```

When `win_user` connects to the MySQL server,
there is a match both to `win_group` and to
`win_user`. The plugin authenticates the user
as `sql_user2` because the more-specific user
match takes precedence over the group match, even though the
group is listed first in the authentication string.

Windows authentication always works for connections from the
same computer on which the server is running. For
cross-computer connections, both computers must be registered
with Microsoft Active Directory. If they are in the same
Windows domain, it is unnecessary to specify a domain name. It
is also possible to permit connections from a different
domain, as in this example:

```sql
CREATE USER sql_accounting
  IDENTIFIED WITH authentication_windows
  AS 'SomeDomain\\Accounting';
```

Here `SomeDomain` is the name of the other
domain. The backslash character is doubled because it is the
MySQL escape character within strings.

MySQL supports the concept of proxy users whereby a client can
connect and authenticate to the MySQL server using one account
but while connected has the privileges of another account (see
[Section 8.2.19, “Proxy Users”](proxy-users.md "8.2.19 Proxy Users")). Suppose that you want Windows
users to connect using a single user name but be mapped based
on their Windows user and group names onto specific MySQL
accounts as follows:

- The `local_user` and
  `MyDomain\domain_user` local and domain
  Windows users should map to the
  `local_wlad` MySQL account.
- Users in the `MyDomain\Developers` domain
  group should map to the `local_dev` MySQL
  account.
- Local machine administrators should map to the
  `local_admin` MySQL account.

To set this up, create a proxy account for Windows users to
connect to, and configure this account so that users and
groups map to the appropriate MySQL accounts
(`local_wlad`, `local_dev`,
`local_admin`). In addition, grant the MySQL
accounts the privileges appropriate to the operations they
need to perform. The following instructions use
`win_proxy` as the proxy account, and
`local_wlad`, `local_dev`,
and `local_admin` as the proxied accounts.

1. Create the proxy MySQL account:

   ```sql
   CREATE USER win_proxy
     IDENTIFIED WITH  authentication_windows
     AS 'local_user = local_wlad,
         MyDomain\\domain_user = local_wlad,
         MyDomain\\Developers = local_dev,
         BUILTIN\\Administrators = local_admin';
   ```
2. For proxying to work, the proxied accounts must exist, so
   create them:

   ```sql
   CREATE USER local_wlad
     IDENTIFIED WITH mysql_no_login;
   CREATE USER local_dev
     IDENTIFIED WITH mysql_no_login;
   CREATE USER local_admin
     IDENTIFIED WITH mysql_no_login;
   ```

   The proxied accounts use the
   `mysql_no_login` authentication plugin to
   prevent clients from using the accounts to log in directly
   to the MySQL server. Instead, users who authenticate using
   Windows are expected to use the
   `win_proxy` proxy account. (This assumes
   that the plugin is installed. For instructions, see
   [Section 8.4.1.9, “No-Login Pluggable Authentication”](no-login-pluggable-authentication.md "8.4.1.9 No-Login Pluggable Authentication").) For
   alternative methods of protecting proxied accounts against
   direct use, see
   [Preventing Direct Login to Proxied Accounts](proxy-users.md#preventing-proxied-account-direct-login "Preventing Direct Login to Proxied Accounts").

   You should also execute
   [`GRANT`](grant.md "15.7.1.6 GRANT Statement") statements (not
   shown) that grant each proxied account the privileges
   required for MySQL access.
3. Grant to the proxy account the
   [`PROXY`](privileges-provided.md#priv_proxy) privilege for each
   proxied account:

   ```sql
   GRANT PROXY ON local_wlad TO win_proxy;
   GRANT PROXY ON local_dev TO win_proxy;
   GRANT PROXY ON local_admin TO win_proxy;
   ```

Now the Windows users `local_user` and
`MyDomain\domain_user` can connect to the
MySQL server as `win_proxy` and when
authenticated have the privileges of the account given in the
authentication string (in this case,
`local_wlad`). A user in the
`MyDomain\Developers` group who connects as
`win_proxy` has the privileges of the
`local_dev` account. A user in the
`BUILTIN\Administrators` group has the
privileges of the `local_admin` account.

To configure authentication so that all Windows users who do
not have their own MySQL account go through a proxy account,
substitute the default proxy account
(`''@''`) for `win_proxy` in
the preceding instructions. For information about default
proxy accounts, see [Section 8.2.19, “Proxy Users”](proxy-users.md "8.2.19 Proxy Users").

Note

If your MySQL installation has anonymous users, they might
conflict with the default proxy user. For more information
about this issue, and ways of dealing with it, see
[Default Proxy User and Anonymous User Conflicts](proxy-users.md#proxy-users-conflicts "Default Proxy User and Anonymous User Conflicts").

To use the Windows authentication plugin with Connector/NET
connection strings in Connector/NET 8.0 and higher, see
[Connector/NET Authentication](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/connector-net/en/connector-net-authentication.html).
