### 1.2.2 The Main Features of MySQL

This section describes some of the important characteristics of
the MySQL Database Software. In most respects, the roadmap applies
to all versions of MySQL. For information about features as they
are introduced into MySQL on a series-specific basis, see the
“In a Nutshell” section of the appropriate Manual:

- MySQL 8.4: [What Is New in MySQL 8.4 since MySQL 8.0](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.4/en/mysql-nutshell.html)
- MySQL 8.0: [Section 1.3, “What Is New in MySQL 8.0”](mysql-nutshell.md "1.3 What Is New in MySQL 8.0")
- MySQL 5.7: [What Is New in MySQL 5.7](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/mysql-nutshell.html)

#### Internals and Portability

- Written in C and C++.
- Tested with a broad range of different compilers.
- Works on many different platforms. See
  <https://www.mysql.com/support/supportedplatforms/database.html>.
- For portability, configured using **CMake**.
- Tested with Purify (a commercial memory leakage detector) as
  well as with Valgrind, a GPL tool
  (<https://valgrind.org/>).
- Uses multi-layered server design with independent modules.
- Designed to be fully multithreaded using kernel threads, to
  easily use multiple CPUs if they are available.
- Provides transactional and nontransactional storage engines.
- Uses very fast B-tree disk tables (`MyISAM`)
  with index compression.
- Designed to make it relatively easy to add other storage
  engines. This is useful if you want to provide an SQL
  interface for an in-house database.
- Uses a very fast thread-based memory allocation system.
- Executes very fast joins using an optimized nested-loop join.
- Implements in-memory hash tables, which are used as temporary
  tables.
- Implements SQL functions using a highly optimized class
  library that should be as fast as possible. Usually there is
  no memory allocation at all after query initialization.
- Provides the server as a separate program for use in a
  client/server networked environment.

#### Data Types

- Many data types: signed/unsigned integers 1, 2, 3, 4, and 8
  bytes long, [`FLOAT`](floating-point-types.md "13.1.4 Floating-Point Types (Approximate Value) - FLOAT, DOUBLE"),
  [`DOUBLE`](floating-point-types.md "13.1.4 Floating-Point Types (Approximate Value) - FLOAT, DOUBLE"),
  [`CHAR`](char.md "13.3.2 The CHAR and VARCHAR Types"),
  [`VARCHAR`](char.md "13.3.2 The CHAR and VARCHAR Types"),
  [`BINARY`](binary-varbinary.md "13.3.3 The BINARY and VARBINARY Types"),
  [`VARBINARY`](binary-varbinary.md "13.3.3 The BINARY and VARBINARY Types"),
  [`TEXT`](blob.md "13.3.4 The BLOB and TEXT Types"),
  [`BLOB`](blob.md "13.3.4 The BLOB and TEXT Types"),
  [`DATE`](datetime.md "13.2.2 The DATE, DATETIME, and TIMESTAMP Types"),
  [`TIME`](time.md "13.2.3 The TIME Type"),
  [`DATETIME`](datetime.md "13.2.2 The DATE, DATETIME, and TIMESTAMP Types"),
  [`TIMESTAMP`](datetime.md "13.2.2 The DATE, DATETIME, and TIMESTAMP Types"),
  [`YEAR`](year.md "13.2.4 The YEAR Type"),
  [`SET`](set.md "13.3.6 The SET Type"),
  [`ENUM`](enum.md "13.3.5 The ENUM Type"), and OpenGIS spatial
  types. See [Chapter 13, *Data Types*](data-types.md "Chapter 13 Data Types").
- Fixed-length and variable-length string types.

#### Statements and Functions

- Full operator and function support in the
  [`SELECT`](select.md "15.2.13 SELECT Statement") list and
  `WHERE` clause of queries. For example:

  ```sql
  mysql> SELECT CONCAT(first_name, ' ', last_name)
      -> FROM citizen
      -> WHERE income/dependents > 10000 AND age > 30;
  ```
- Full support for SQL `GROUP BY` and
  `ORDER BY` clauses. Support for group
  functions ([`COUNT()`](aggregate-functions.md#function_count),
  [`AVG()`](aggregate-functions.md#function_avg),
  [`STD()`](aggregate-functions.md#function_std),
  [`SUM()`](aggregate-functions.md#function_sum),
  [`MAX()`](aggregate-functions.md#function_max),
  [`MIN()`](aggregate-functions.md#function_min), and
  [`GROUP_CONCAT()`](aggregate-functions.md#function_group-concat)).
- Support for `LEFT OUTER JOIN` and
  `RIGHT OUTER JOIN` with both standard SQL and
  ODBC syntax.
- Support for aliases on tables and columns as required by
  standard SQL.
- Support for [`DELETE`](delete.md "15.2.2 DELETE Statement"),
  [`INSERT`](insert.md "15.2.7 INSERT Statement"),
  [`REPLACE`](replace.md "15.2.12 REPLACE Statement"), and
  [`UPDATE`](update.md "15.2.17 UPDATE Statement") to return the number of
  rows that were changed (affected), or to return the number of
  rows matched instead by setting a flag when connecting to the
  server.
- Support for MySQL-specific [`SHOW`](show.md "15.7.7 SHOW Statements")
  statements that retrieve information about databases, storage
  engines, tables, and indexes. Support for the
  `INFORMATION_SCHEMA` database, implemented
  according to standard SQL.
- An [`EXPLAIN`](explain.md "15.8.2 EXPLAIN Statement") statement to show
  how the optimizer resolves a query.
- Independence of function names from table or column names. For
  example, `ABS` is a valid column name. The
  only restriction is that for a function call, no spaces are
  permitted between the function name and the
  “`(`” that follows it. See
  [Section 11.3, “Keywords and Reserved Words”](keywords.md "11.3 Keywords and Reserved Words").
- You can refer to tables from different databases in the same
  statement.

#### Security

- A privilege and password system that is very flexible and
  secure, and that enables host-based verification.
- Password security by encryption of all password traffic when
  you connect to a server.

#### Scalability and Limits

- Support for large databases. We use MySQL Server with
  databases that contain 50 million records. We also know of
  users who use MySQL Server with 200,000 tables and about
  5,000,000,000 rows.
- Support for up to 64 indexes per table. Each index may consist
  of 1 to 16 columns or parts of columns. The maximum index
  width for [`InnoDB`](innodb-storage-engine.md "Chapter 17 The InnoDB Storage Engine") tables is either
  767 bytes or 3072 bytes. See [Section 17.22, “InnoDB Limits”](innodb-limits.md "17.22 InnoDB Limits").
  The maximum index width for
  [`MyISAM`](myisam-storage-engine.md "18.2 The MyISAM Storage Engine") tables is 1000 bytes. See
  [Section 18.2, “The MyISAM Storage Engine”](myisam-storage-engine.md "18.2 The MyISAM Storage Engine"). An index may use a
  prefix of a column for [`CHAR`](char.md "13.3.2 The CHAR and VARCHAR Types"),
  [`VARCHAR`](char.md "13.3.2 The CHAR and VARCHAR Types"),
  [`BLOB`](blob.md "13.3.4 The BLOB and TEXT Types"), or
  [`TEXT`](blob.md "13.3.4 The BLOB and TEXT Types") column types.

#### Connectivity

- Clients can connect to MySQL Server using several protocols:

  - Clients can connect using TCP/IP sockets on any platform.
  - On Windows systems, clients can connect using named pipes
    if the server is started with the
    [`named_pipe`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_named_pipe) system
    variable enabled. Windows servers also support
    shared-memory connections if started with the
    [`shared_memory`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_shared_memory) system
    variable enabled. Clients can connect through shared
    memory by using the
    [`--protocol=memory`](connection-options.md#option_general_protocol) option.
  - On Unix systems, clients can connect using Unix domain
    socket files.
- MySQL client programs can be written in many languages. A
  client library written in C is available for clients written
  in C or C++, or for any language that provides C bindings.
- APIs for C, C++, Eiffel, Java, Perl, PHP, Python, Ruby, and
  Tcl are available, enabling MySQL clients to be written in
  many languages. See [Chapter 31, *Connectors and APIs*](connectors-apis.md "Chapter 31 Connectors and APIs").
- The Connector/ODBC (MyODBC) interface provides MySQL support
  for client programs that use ODBC (Open Database Connectivity)
  connections. For example, you can use MS Access to connect to
  your MySQL server. Clients can be run on Windows or Unix.
  Connector/ODBC source is available. All ODBC 2.5 functions are
  supported, as are many others. See
  [MySQL Connector/ODBC Developer Guide](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/connector-odbc/en/).
- The Connector/J interface provides MySQL support for Java
  client programs that use JDBC connections. Clients can be run
  on Windows or Unix. Connector/J source is available. See
  [MySQL Connector/J Developer Guide](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/connector-j/en/).
- MySQL Connector/NET enables developers to easily create .NET applications
  that require secure, high-performance data connectivity with
  MySQL. It implements the required ADO.NET interfaces and
  integrates into ADO.NET aware tools. Developers can build
  applications using their choice of .NET languages. MySQL Connector/NET is
  a fully managed ADO.NET driver written in 100% pure C#. See
  [MySQL Connector/NET Developer Guide](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/connector-net/en/).

#### Localization

- The server can provide error messages to clients in many
  languages. See [Section 12.12, “Setting the Error Message Language”](error-message-language.md "12.12 Setting the Error Message Language").
- Full support for several different character sets, including
  `latin1` (cp1252), `german`,
  `big5`, `ujis`, several
  Unicode character sets, and more. For example, the
  Scandinavian characters “`å`”,
  “`ä`” and
  “`ö`” are permitted in table
  and column names.
- All data is saved in the chosen character set.
- Sorting and comparisons are done according to the default
  character set and collation. It is possible to change this
  when the MySQL server is started (see
  [Section 12.3.2, “Server Character Set and Collation”](charset-server.md "12.3.2 Server Character Set and Collation")). To see an example of very
  advanced sorting, look at the Czech sorting code. MySQL Server
  supports many different character sets that can be specified
  at compile time and runtime.
- The server time zone can be changed dynamically, and
  individual clients can specify their own time zone. See
  [Section 7.1.15, “MySQL Server Time Zone Support”](time-zone-support.md "7.1.15 MySQL Server Time Zone Support").

#### Clients and Tools

- MySQL includes several client and utility programs. These
  include both command-line programs such as
  [**mysqldump**](mysqldump.md "6.5.4 mysqldump — A Database Backup Program") and
  [**mysqladmin**](mysqladmin.md "6.5.2 mysqladmin — A MySQL Server Administration Program"), and graphical programs such as
  [MySQL Workbench](workbench.md "Chapter 33 MySQL Workbench").
- MySQL Server has built-in support for SQL statements to check,
  optimize, and repair tables. These statements are available
  from the command line through the
  [**mysqlcheck**](mysqlcheck.md "6.5.3 mysqlcheck — A Table Maintenance Program") client. MySQL also includes
  [**myisamchk**](myisamchk.md "6.6.4 myisamchk — MyISAM Table-Maintenance Utility"), a very fast command-line utility
  for performing these operations on `MyISAM`
  tables. See [Chapter 6, *MySQL Programs*](programs.md "Chapter 6 MySQL Programs").
- MySQL programs can be invoked with the `--help`
  or `-?` option to obtain online assistance.
