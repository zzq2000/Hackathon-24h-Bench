#### 25.4.2.4 Other NDB Cluster Configuration Parameters

The listings in this section provide information about
parameters used in the `[computer]`,
`[tcp]`, and `[shm]` sections
of a `config.ini` file for configuring NDB
Cluster. For detailed descriptions and additional information
about individual parameters, see
[Section 25.4.3.10, “NDB Cluster TCP/IP Connections”](mysql-cluster-tcp-definition.md "25.4.3.10 NDB Cluster TCP/IP Connections"), or
[Section 25.4.3.12, “NDB Cluster Shared-Memory Connections”](mysql-cluster-shm-definition.md "25.4.3.12 NDB Cluster Shared-Memory Connections"), as appropriate.

The following parameters apply to the
`config.ini` file's
`[computer]` section:

- `HostName`:
  Host name or IP address of this computer.
- `Id`:
  Unique identifier for this computer.

The following parameters apply to the
`config.ini` file's
`[tcp]` section:

- `AllowUnresolvedHostNames`:
  When false (default), failure by management node to resolve
  host name results in fatal error; when true, unresolved host
  names are reported as warnings only.
- `Checksum`:
  If checksum is enabled, all signals between nodes are
  checked for errors.
- `Group`:
  Used for group proximity; smaller value is interpreted as
  being closer.
- `HostName1`:
  Name or IP address of first of two computers joined by TCP
  connection.
- `HostName2`:
  Name or IP address of second of two computers joined by TCP
  connection.
- `NodeId1`:
  ID of node (data node, API node, or management node) on one
  side of connection.
- `NodeId2`:
  ID of node (data node, API node, or management node) on one
  side of connection.
- `NodeIdServer`:
  Set server side of TCP connection.
- `OverloadLimit`:
  When more than this many unsent bytes are in send buffer,
  connection is considered overloaded.
- `PreferIPVersion`:
  Indicate DNS resolver preference for IP version 4 or 6.
- `PreSendChecksum`:
  If this parameter and Checksum are both enabled, perform
  pre-send checksum checks, and check all TCP signals between
  nodes for errors.
- `Proxy`:
  ....
- `ReceiveBufferMemory`:
  Bytes of buffer for signals received by this node.
- `SendBufferMemory`:
  Bytes of TCP buffer for signals sent from this node.
- `SendSignalId`:
  Sends ID in each signal. Used in trace files. Defaults to
  true in debug builds.
- `TcpSpinTime`:
  Time to spin before going to sleep when receiving.
- `TCP_MAXSEG_SIZE`:
  Value used for TCP\_MAXSEG.
- `TCP_RCV_BUF_SIZE`:
  Value used for SO\_RCVBUF.
- `TCP_SND_BUF_SIZE`:
  Value used for SO\_SNDBUF.
- `TcpBind_INADDR_ANY`:
  Bind InAddrAny instead of host name for server part of
  connection.

The following parameters apply to the
`config.ini` file's
`[shm]` section:

- `Checksum`:
  If checksum is enabled, all signals between nodes are
  checked for errors.
- `Group`:
  Used for group proximity; smaller value is interpreted as
  being closer.
- `HostName1`:
  Name or IP address of first of two computers joined by SHM
  connection.
- `HostName2`:
  Name or IP address of second of two computers joined by SHM
  connection.
- `NodeId1`:
  ID of node (data node, API node, or management node) on one
  side of connection.
- `NodeId2`:
  ID of node (data node, API node, or management node) on one
  side of connection.
- `NodeIdServer`:
  Set server side of SHM connection.
- `OverloadLimit`:
  When more than this many unsent bytes are in send buffer,
  connection is considered overloaded.
- `PreSendChecksum`:
  If this parameter and Checksum are both enabled, perform
  pre-send checksum checks, and check all SHM signals between
  nodes for errors.
- `SendBufferMemory`:
  Bytes in shared memory buffer for signals sent from this
  node.
- `SendSignalId`:
  Sends ID in each signal. Used in trace files.
- `ShmKey`:
  Shared memory key; when set to 1, this is calculated by NDB.
- `ShmSpinTime`:
  When receiving, number of microseconds to spin before
  sleeping.
- `ShmSize`:
  Size of shared memory segment.
- `Signum`:
  Signal number to be used for signalling.
