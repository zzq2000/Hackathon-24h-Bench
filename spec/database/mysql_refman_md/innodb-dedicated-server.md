### 17.8.12 Enabling Automatic InnoDB Configuration for a Dedicated MySQL Server

When the server is started with
[`--innodb-dedicated-server`](innodb-parameters.md#option_mysqld_innodb-dedicated-server),
`InnoDB` automatically calculates values for and
sets the following system variables:

- [`innodb_buffer_pool_size`](innodb-parameters.md#sysvar_innodb_buffer_pool_size)
- [`innodb_redo_log_capacity`](innodb-parameters.md#sysvar_innodb_redo_log_capacity)
  (MySQL 8.0.30 and later)
- [`innodb_log_file_size`](innodb-parameters.md#sysvar_innodb_log_file_size) (prior
  to MySQL 8.0.30)
- [`innodb_log_files_in_group`](innodb-parameters.md#sysvar_innodb_log_files_in_group)
  (prior to MySQL 8.0.30)
- [`innodb_flush_method`](innodb-parameters.md#sysvar_innodb_flush_method)

Note

`innodb_log_file_size` and
`innodb_log_files_in_group` are deprecated as
of MySQL 8.0.30, and are superseded by
`innodb_redo_log_capacity`. You should expect
`innodb_log_file_size` and
`innodb_log_files_in_group` to be removed in a
future version of MySQL.

You should consider using
`--innodb-dedicated-server` only if the MySQL
instance resides on a dedicated server where it can use all
available system resources—for example, if you run MySQL
Server in a Docker container or dedicated VM that runs MySQL only.
using `--innodb-dedicated-server` is not
recommended if the MySQL instance shares system resources with
other applications.

The value for each affected variable is determined and applied by
`--innodb-dedicated-server` as described in the
following list:

- [`innodb_buffer_pool_size`](innodb-parameters.md#sysvar_innodb_buffer_pool_size)

  Buffer pool size is calculated according to the amount of
  memory detected on the server, as shown in the following
  table:

  **Table 17.8 Automatically Configured Buffer Pool Size**

  | Detected Server Memory | Buffer Pool Size |
  | --- | --- |
  | Less than 1GB | 128MB (the default value) |
  | 1GB to 4GB | *`detected server memory`* \* 0.5 |
  | Greater than 4GB | *`detected server memory`* \* 0.75 |
- [`innodb_redo_log_capacity`](innodb-parameters.md#sysvar_innodb_redo_log_capacity)

  Redo log capacity is configured according to the amount of
  memory detected on the server and, in some cases, whether
  [`innodb_buffer_pool_size`](innodb-parameters.md#sysvar_innodb_buffer_pool_size) is
  configured explicitly. If
  [`innodb_buffer_pool_size`](innodb-parameters.md#sysvar_innodb_buffer_pool_size) is
  not configured explicitly, the default value is assumed.

  Warning

  Automatic redo log capacity configuration behavior is
  undefined if
  [`innodb_buffer_pool_size`](innodb-parameters.md#sysvar_innodb_buffer_pool_size) is
  set to a value larger than the detected amount of server
  memory.

  **Table 17.9 Automatically Configured Log File Size**

  | Detected Server Memory | Buffer Pool Size | Redo Log Capacity |
  | --- | --- | --- |
  | Less than 1GB | Not configured | 100MB |
  | Less than 1GB | Less than 1GB | 100MB |
  | 1GB to 2GB | Not applicable | 100MB |
  | 2GB to 4GB | Not configured | 1GB |
  | 2GB to 4GB | Any configured value | round(0.5 \* *`detected server memory`* in GB) \* 0.5 GB |
  | 4GB to 10.66GB | Not applicable | round(0.75 \* *`detected server memory`* in GB) \* 0.5 GB |
  | 10.66GB to 170.66GB | Not applicable | round(0.5625 \* *`detected server memory`* in GB) \* 1 GB |
  | Greater than 170.66GB | Not applicable | 128GB |
- [`innodb_log_file_size`](innodb-parameters.md#sysvar_innodb_log_file_size)
  (deprecated)

  Log file size is set according to the automatically configured
  buffer pool size, as shown in the following table:

  **Table 17.10 Automatically Configured Log File Size**

  | Buffer Pool Size | Log File Size |
  | --- | --- |
  | Less than 8GB | 512MB |
  | 8GB to 128GB | 1024MB |
  | Greater than 128GB | 2048MB |
- [`innodb_log_files_in_group`](innodb-parameters.md#sysvar_innodb_log_files_in_group)
  (deprecated)

  The number of log files is determined according to the
  automatically configured buffer pool size, as shown in the
  following table:

  **Table 17.11 Automatically Configured Number of Log Files**

  | Buffer Pool Size | Number of Log Files |
  | --- | --- |
  | Less than 8GB | round(*`buffer pool size`*) |
  | 8GB to 128GB | round(*`buffer pool size`* \* 0.75) |
  | Greater than 128GB | 64 |

  Note

  The minimum value for
  `innodb_log_files_in_group` value is
  `2`; this lower limit is enforced if the
  rounded buffer pool size value is less than this number.
- [`innodb_flush_method`](innodb-parameters.md#sysvar_innodb_flush_method)

  The flush method is set to
  `O_DIRECT_NO_FSYNC` when the server is
  started with `--innodb-dedicated-server`. If
  `O_DIRECT_NO_FSYNC` is not available, the
  default value for
  [`innodb_flush_method`](innodb-parameters.md#sysvar_innodb_flush_method).

  `InnoDB` uses `O_DIRECT`
  during flushing I/O, but skips the `fsync()`
  system call after each write operation.

  Warning

  Prior to MySQL 8.0.14, `O_DIRECT_NO_FSYNC`
  was not suitable for file systems such as XFS and EXT4,
  which require an `fsync()` system call to
  synchronize file system metadata changes.

  As of MySQL 8.0.14, `fsync()` is called
  after creating a new file, after increasing file size, and
  after closing a file, to ensure that file system metadata
  changes are synchronized. The `fsync()`
  system call is still skipped after each write operation.

  Data loss is possible if redo log files and data files
  reside on different storage devices, and an unexpected exit
  occurs before data file writes are flushed from a device
  cache that is not battery-backed. If you use or intend to
  use different storage devices for redo log files and data
  files, and your data files reside on a device with a cache
  that is not battery-backed, use `O_DIRECT`
  instead.

If one of the variables listed previously is set explicitly in an
option file or elsewhere, this explicit value is used, and a
startup warning similar to this one is printed to
`stderr`:

[Warning] [000000] InnoDB: Option
innodb\_dedicated\_server is ignored for innodb\_buffer\_pool\_size
because innodb\_buffer\_pool\_size=134217728 is specified
explicitly.

Setting one variable explicitly does not prevent the automatic
configuration of other options.

If the server is started with
`--innodb-dedicated-server` and
[`innodb_buffer_pool_size`](innodb-parameters.md#sysvar_innodb_buffer_pool_size) is set
explicitly, variable settings based on buffer pool size use the
buffer pool size value calculated according to the amount of
memory detected on the server rather than the explicitly defined
buffer pool size value.

Note

Automatic configuration settings are applied by
`--innodb-dedicated-server`
*only* when the MySQL server is started. If
you later set any of the affected variables explicitly, this
overrides its predetermined value, and the value that was
explicitly set is applied. Setting one of these variables to
`DEFAULT` causes it to be set to the actual
default value as shown in the variable's description in the
Manual, and does *not* cause it to revert to
the value set by `--innodb-dedicated-server`. The
corresponding system variable
`innodb_dedicated_server` is changed only by
starting the server with
`--innodb-dedicated-server` (or with
`--innodb-dedicated-server=ON` or
`--innodb-dedicated-server=OFF`); it is otherwise
read-only.
