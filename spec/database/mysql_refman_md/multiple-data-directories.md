### 7.8.1 Setting Up Multiple Data Directories

Each MySQL Instance on a machine should have its own data
directory. The location is specified using the
[`--datadir=dir_name`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_datadir)
option.

There are different methods of setting up a data directory for a
new instance:

- Create a new data directory.
- Copy an existing data directory.

The following discussion provides more detail about each method.

Warning

Normally, you should never have two servers that update data in
the same databases. This may lead to unpleasant surprises if
your operating system does not support fault-free system
locking. If (despite this warning) you run multiple servers
using the same data directory and they have logging enabled, you
must use the appropriate options to specify log file names that
are unique to each server. Otherwise, the servers try to log to
the same files.

Even when the preceding precautions are observed, this kind of
setup works only with `MyISAM` and
`MERGE` tables, and not with any of the other
storage engines. Also, this warning against sharing a data
directory among servers always applies in an NFS environment.
Permitting multiple MySQL servers to access a common data
directory over NFS is a *very bad idea*. The
primary problem is that NFS is the speed bottleneck. It is not
meant for such use. Another risk with NFS is that you must
devise a way to ensure that two or more servers do not interfere
with each other. Usually NFS file locking is handled by the
`lockd` daemon, but at the moment there is no
platform that performs locking 100% reliably in every situation.

#### Create a New Data Directory

With this method, the data directory is in the same state as when
you first install MySQL, and has the default set of MySQL accounts
and no user data.

On Unix, initialize the data directory. See
[Section 2.9, “Postinstallation Setup and Testing”](postinstallation.md "2.9 Postinstallation Setup and Testing").

On Windows, the data directory is included in the MySQL
distribution:

- MySQL Zip archive distributions for Windows contain an
  unmodified data directory. You can unpack such a distribution
  into a temporary location, then copy it
  `data` directory to where you are setting
  up the new instance.
- Windows MSI package installers create and set up the data
  directory that the installed server uses, but also create a
  pristine “template” data directory named
  `data` under the installation directory.
  After an installation has been performed using an MSI package,
  the template data directory can be copied to set up additional
  MySQL instances.

#### Copy an Existing Data Directory

With this method, any MySQL accounts or user data present in the
data directory are carried over to the new data directory.

1. Stop the existing MySQL instance using the data directory.
   This must be a clean shutdown so that the instance flushes any
   pending changes to disk.
2. Copy the data directory to the location where the new data
   directory should be.
3. Copy the `my.cnf` or
   `my.ini` option file used by the existing
   instance. This serves as a basis for the new instance.
4. Modify the new option file so that any pathnames referring to
   the original data directory refer to the new data directory.
   Also, modify any other options that must be unique per
   instance, such as the TCP/IP port number and the log files.
   For a list of parameters that must be unique per instance, see
   [Section 7.8, “Running Multiple MySQL Instances on One Machine”](multiple-servers.md "7.8 Running Multiple MySQL Instances on One Machine").
5. Start the new instance, telling it to use the new option file.
