## 3.11 Upgrading MySQL on Windows

There are two approaches for upgrading MySQL on Windows:

- [Using MySQL Installer](windows-upgrading.md#windows-upgrading-installer "Upgrading MySQL with MySQL Installer")
- [Using the
  Windows ZIP archive distribution](windows-upgrading.md#windows-upgrading-zip-distribution "Upgrading MySQL Using the Windows ZIP Distribution")

The approach you select depends on how the existing installation
was performed. Before proceeding, review
[Chapter 3, *Upgrading MySQL*](upgrading.md "Chapter 3 Upgrading MySQL") for additional information on
upgrading MySQL that is not specific to Windows.

Note

Whichever approach you choose, always back up your current MySQL
installation before performing an upgrade. See
[Section 9.2, “Database Backup Methods”](backup-methods.md "9.2 Database Backup Methods").

Upgrades between non-GA releases (or from a non-GA release to a GA
release) are not supported. Significant development changes take
place in non-GA releases and you may encounter compatibility
issues or problems starting the server.

Note

MySQL Installer does not support upgrades between
*Community* releases and
*Commercial* releases. If you require this
type of upgrade, perform it using the
[ZIP
archive](windows-upgrading.md#windows-upgrading-zip-distribution "Upgrading MySQL Using the Windows ZIP Distribution") approach.

### Upgrading MySQL with MySQL Installer

Performing an upgrade with MySQL Installer is the best approach when the
current server installation was performed with it and the
upgrade is within the current release series. MySQL Installer does not
support upgrades between release series, such as from
5.7 to 8.0, and it does not provide
an upgrade indicator to prompt you to upgrade. For instructions
on upgrading between release series, see
[Upgrading MySQL Using the Windows ZIP Distribution](windows-upgrading.md#windows-upgrading-zip-distribution "Upgrading MySQL Using the Windows ZIP Distribution").

To perform an upgrade using MySQL Installer:

1. Start MySQL Installer.
2. From the dashboard, click Catalog to
   download the latest changes to the catalog. The installed
   server can be upgraded only if the dashboard displays an
   arrow next to the version number of the server.
3. Click Upgrade. All products that have a
   newer version now appear in a list.

   Note

   MySQL Installer deselects the server upgrade option for milestone
   releases (Pre-Release) in the same release series. In
   addition, it displays a warning to indicate that the
   upgrade is not supported, identifies the risks of
   continuing, and provides a summary of the steps to perform
   an upgrade manually. You can reselect server upgrade and
   proceed at your own risk.
4. Deselect all but the MySQL server product, unless you intend
   to upgrade other products at this time, and click
   Next.
5. Click Execute to start the download.
   When the download finishes, click
   Next to begin the upgrade operation.

   Upgrades to MySQL 8.0.16 and higher may show an option to
   skip the upgrade check and process for system tables. For
   more information about this option, see
   [Important
   server upgrade conditions](mysql-installer-catalog-dashboard.md#mysql-installer-alter-upgrade).
6. Configure the server.

### Upgrading MySQL Using the Windows ZIP Distribution

To perform an upgrade using the Windows ZIP archive
distribution:

1. Download the latest Windows ZIP Archive distribution of
   MySQL from <https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/>.
2. If the server is running, stop it. If the server is
   installed as a service, stop the service with the following
   command from the command prompt:

   ```terminal
   C:\> SC STOP mysqld_service_name
   ```

   Alternatively, use **NET STOP
   *`mysqld_service_name`*** .

   If you are not running the MySQL server as a service, use
   [**mysqladmin**](mysqladmin.md "6.5.2 mysqladmin — A MySQL Server Administration Program") to stop it. For example,
   before upgrading from MySQL 5.7 to
   8.0, use [**mysqladmin**](mysqladmin.md "6.5.2 mysqladmin — A MySQL Server Administration Program") from
   MySQL 5.7 as follows:

   ```terminal
   C:\> "C:\Program Files\MySQL\MySQL Server 5.7\bin\mysqladmin" -u root shutdown
   ```

   Note

   If the MySQL `root` user account has a
   password, invoke [**mysqladmin**](mysqladmin.md "6.5.2 mysqladmin — A MySQL Server Administration Program") with the
   `-p` option and enter the password when
   prompted.
3. Extract the ZIP archive. You may either overwrite your
   existing MySQL installation (usually located at
   `C:\mysql`), or install it into a
   different directory, such as `C:\mysql8`.
   Overwriting the existing installation is recommended.
4. Restart the server. For example, use the **SC START
   *`mysqld_service_name`***  or
   **NET START
   *`mysqld_service_name`***
   command if you run MySQL as a service, or invoke
   [**mysqld**](mysqld.md "6.3.1 mysqld — The MySQL Server") directly otherwise.
5. Prior to MySQL 8.0.16, run [**mysql\_upgrade**](mysql-upgrade.md "6.4.5 mysql_upgrade — Check and Upgrade MySQL Tables")
   as Administrator to check your tables, attempt to repair
   them if necessary, and update your grant tables if they have
   changed so that you can take advantage of any new
   capabilities. See [Section 6.4.5, “mysql\_upgrade — Check and Upgrade MySQL Tables”](mysql-upgrade.md "6.4.5 mysql_upgrade — Check and Upgrade MySQL Tables"). As of
   MySQL 8.0.16, this step is not required, as the server
   performs all tasks previously handled by
   [**mysql\_upgrade**](mysql-upgrade.md "6.4.5 mysql_upgrade — Check and Upgrade MySQL Tables").
6. If you encounter errors, see
   [Section 2.3.5, “Troubleshooting a Microsoft Windows MySQL Server Installation”](windows-troubleshooting.md "2.3.5 Troubleshooting a Microsoft Windows MySQL Server Installation").
