#### 7.4.2.10 Error Log File Flushing and Renaming

If you flush the error log using a [`FLUSH
ERROR LOGS`](flush.md#flush-error-logs) or [`FLUSH
LOGS`](flush.md#flush-logs) statement, or a [**mysqladmin
flush-logs**](mysqladmin.md "6.5.2 mysqladmin — A MySQL Server Administration Program") command, the server closes and reopens any
error log file to which it is writing. To rename an error log
file, do so manually before flushing. Flushing the logs then
opens a new file with the original file name. For example,
assuming a log file name of
`host_name.err`,
use the following commands to rename the file and create a new
one:

```terminal
mv host_name.err host_name.err-old
mysqladmin flush-logs error
mv host_name.err-old backup-directory
```

On Windows, use **rename** rather than
**mv**.

If the location of the error log file is not writable by the
server, the log-flushing operation fails to create a new log
file. For example, on Linux, the server might write the error
log to the `/var/log/mysqld.log` file, where
the `/var/log` directory is owned by
`root` and is not writable by
[**mysqld**](mysqld.md "6.3.1 mysqld — The MySQL Server"). For information about handling this
case, see [Section 7.4.6, “Server Log Maintenance”](log-file-maintenance.md "7.4.6 Server Log Maintenance").

If the server is not writing to a named error log file, no error
log file renaming occurs when the error log is flushed.
