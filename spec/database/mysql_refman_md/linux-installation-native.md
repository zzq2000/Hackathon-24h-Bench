### 2.5.7 Installing MySQL on Linux from the Native Software Repositories

Many Linux distributions include a version of the MySQL server,
client tools, and development components in their native software
repositories and can be installed with the platforms' standard
package management systems. This section provides basic
instructions for installing MySQL using those package management
systems.

Important

Native packages are often several versions behind the currently
available release. You are also normally unable to install
development milestone releases (DMRs), since these are not
usually made available in the native repositories. Before
proceeding, we recommend that you check out the other
installation options described in
[Section 2.5, “Installing MySQL on Linux”](linux-installation.md "2.5 Installing MySQL on Linux").

Distribution specific instructions are shown below:

- **Red Hat Linux, Fedora, CentOS**

  Note

  For a number of Linux distributions, you can install MySQL
  using the MySQL Yum repository instead of the platform's
  native software repository. See
  [Section 2.5.1, “Installing MySQL on Linux Using the MySQL Yum Repository”](linux-installation-yum-repo.md "2.5.1 Installing MySQL on Linux Using the MySQL Yum Repository") for details.

  For Red Hat and similar distributions, the MySQL distribution
  is divided into a number of separate packages,
  `mysql` for the client tools,
  `mysql-server` for the server and associated
  tools, and `mysql-libs` for the libraries.
  The libraries are required if you want to provide connectivity
  from different languages and environments such as Perl, Python
  and others.

  To install, use the **yum** command to specify
  the packages that you want to install. For example:

  ```terminal
  #> yum install mysql mysql-server mysql-libs mysql-server
  Loaded plugins: presto, refresh-packagekit

  Complete!
  ```

  MySQL and the MySQL server should now be installed. A sample
  configuration file is installed into
  `/etc/my.cnf`. To start the MySQL server
  use **systemctl**:

  ```terminal
  $> systemctl start mysqld
  ```

  The database tables are automatically created for you, if they
  do not already exist. You should, however, run
  [**mysql\_secure\_installation**](mysql-secure-installation.md "6.4.2 mysql_secure_installation — Improve MySQL Installation Security") to set the root
  passwords on your server.
- **Debian, Ubuntu, Kubuntu**

  Note

  For supported Debian and Ubuntu versions, MySQL can be
  installed using the
  [MySQL APT
  Repository](https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/repo/apt/) instead of the platform's native software
  repository. See
  [Section 2.5.2, “Installing MySQL on Linux Using the MySQL APT Repository”](linux-installation-apt-repo.md "2.5.2 Installing MySQL on Linux Using the MySQL APT Repository") for details.

  On Debian and related distributions, there are two packages
  for MySQL in their software repositories,
  `mysql-client` and
  `mysql-server`, for the client and server
  components respectively. You should specify an explicit
  version, for example `mysql-client-5.1`, to
  ensure that you install the version of MySQL that you want.

  To download and install, including any dependencies, use the
  **apt-get** command, specifying the packages
  that you want to install.

  Note

  Before installing, make sure that you update your
  `apt-get` index files to ensure you are
  downloading the latest available version.

  Note

  The **apt-get** command installs a number of
  packages, including the MySQL server, in order to provide
  the typical tools and application environment. This can mean
  that you install a large number of packages in addition to
  the main MySQL package.

  During installation, the initial database is created, and you
  are prompted for the MySQL root password (and confirmation). A
  configuration file is created in
  `/etc/mysql/my.cnf`. An init script is
  created in `/etc/init.d/mysql`.

  The server should already be started. You can manually start
  and stop the server using:

  ```terminal
  #> service mysql [start|stop]
  ```

  The service is automatically added to the 2, 3 and 4 run
  levels, with stop scripts in the single, shutdown and restart
  levels.
