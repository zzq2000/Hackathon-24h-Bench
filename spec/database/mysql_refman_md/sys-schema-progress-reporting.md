## 30.3 sys Schema Progress Reporting

The following [`sys`](sys-schema.md "Chapter 30 MySQL sys Schema") schema views
provide progress reporting for long-running transactions:

```none
processlist
session
x$processlist
x$session
```

Assuming that the required instruments and consumers are enabled,
the `progress` column of these views shows the
percentage of work completed for stages that support progress
reporting.

Stage progress reporting requires that the
`events_stages_current` consumer be enabled, as
well as the instruments for which progress information is desired.
Instruments for these stages currently support progress reporting:

```none
stage/sql/Copying to tmp table
stage/innodb/alter table (end)
stage/innodb/alter table (flush)
stage/innodb/alter table (insert)
stage/innodb/alter table (log apply index)
stage/innodb/alter table (log apply table)
stage/innodb/alter table (merge sort)
stage/innodb/alter table (read PK and internal sort)
stage/innodb/buffer pool load
```

For stages that do not support estimated and completed work
reporting, or if the required instruments or consumers are not
enabled, the `progress` column is
`NULL`.
