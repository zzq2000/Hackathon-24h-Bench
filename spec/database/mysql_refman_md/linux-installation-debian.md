### 2.5.5 Installing MySQL on Linux Using Debian Packages from Oracle

Oracle provides Debian packages for installing MySQL on Debian or
Debian-like Linux systems. The packages are available through two
different channels:

- The [MySQL APT
  Repository](https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/repo/apt/). This is the preferred method for
  installing MySQL on Debian-like systems, as it provides a
  simple and convenient way to install and update MySQL
  products. For details, see
  [Section 2.5.2, “Installing MySQL on Linux Using the MySQL APT Repository”](linux-installation-apt-repo.md "2.5.2 Installing MySQL on Linux Using the MySQL APT Repository").
- The [MySQL Developer Zone's
  Download Area](https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/). For details, see
  [Section 2.1.3, “How to Get MySQL”](getting-mysql.md "2.1.3 How to Get MySQL"). The following are some
  information on the Debian packages available there and the
  instructions for installing them:

  - Various Debian packages are provided in the MySQL
    Developer Zone for installing different components of
    MySQL on the current Debian and Ubuntu platforms. The
    preferred method is to use the tarball bundle, which
    contains the packages needed for a basic setup of MySQL.
    The tarball bundles have names in the format of
    `mysql-server_MVER-DVER_CPU.deb-bundle.tar`.
    *`MVER`* is the MySQL version and
    *`DVER`* is the Linux distribution
    version. The *`CPU`* value
    indicates the processor type or family for which the
    package is built, as shown in the following table:

    **Table 2.13 MySQL Debian and Ubuntu Installation Packages CPU Identifiers**

    | *`CPU`* Value | Intended Processor Type or Family |
    | --- | --- |
    | `i386` | Pentium processor or better, 32 bit |
    | `amd64` | 64-bit x86 processor |
  - After downloading the tarball, unpack it with the
    following command:

    ```terminal
    $> tar -xvf mysql-server_MVER-DVER_CPU.deb-bundle.tar
    ```
  - You may need to install the `libaio`
    library if it is not already present on your system:

    ```terminal
    $> sudo apt-get install libaio1
    ```
  - Preconfigure the MySQL server package with the following
    command:

    ```terminal
    $> sudo dpkg-preconfigure mysql-community-server_*.deb
    ```

    You are asked to provide a password for the root user for
    your MySQL installation. You might also be asked other
    questions regarding the installation.

    Important

    Make sure you remember the root password you set. Users
    who want to set a password later can leave the
    password field blank in the
    dialogue box and just press OK;
    in that case, root access to the server is authenticated
    using the
    [MySQL
    Socket Peer-Credential Authentication Plugin](socket-pluggable-authentication.md "8.4.1.10 Socket Peer-Credential Pluggable Authentication") for
    connections using a Unix socket file. You can set the
    root password later using
    [**mysql\_secure\_installation**](mysql-secure-installation.md "6.4.2 mysql_secure_installation — Improve MySQL Installation Security").
  - For a basic installation of the MySQL server, install the
    database common files package, the client package, the
    client metapackage, the server package, and the server
    metapackage (in that order); you can do that with a single
    command:

    ```terminal
    $> sudo dpkg -i mysql-{common,community-client-plugins,community-client-core,community-client,client,community-server-core,community-server,server}_*.deb
    ```

    There are also packages with
    `server-core` and
    `client-core` in the package names. These
    contain binaries only and are installed automatically by
    the standard packages. Installing them by themselves does
    not result in a functioning MySQL setup.

    If you are being warned of unmet dependencies by
    **dpkg** (such as libmecab2), you can fix
    them using **apt-get**:

    ```terminal
    sudo apt-get -f install
    ```

    Here are where the files are installed on the system:

    - All configuration files (like
      `my.cnf`) are under
      `/etc/mysql`
    - All binaries, libraries, headers, etc., are under
      `/usr/bin` and
      `/usr/sbin`
    - The data directory is under
      `/var/lib/mysql`

Note

Debian distributions of MySQL are also provided by other
vendors. Be aware that they may differ from those built by
Oracle in features, capabilities, and conventions (including
communication setup), and that the instructions in this manual
do not necessarily apply to installing them. The vendor's
instructions should be consulted instead.
