### 12.3.9 Examples of Character Set and Collation Assignment

The following examples show how MySQL determines default
character set and collation values.

**Example 1: Table and Column
Definition**

```sql
CREATE TABLE t1
(
    c1 CHAR(10) CHARACTER SET latin1 COLLATE latin1_german1_ci
) DEFAULT CHARACTER SET latin2 COLLATE latin2_bin;
```

Here we have a column with a `latin1` character
set and a `latin1_german1_ci` collation. The
definition is explicit, so that is straightforward. Notice that
there is no problem with storing a `latin1`
column in a `latin2` table.

**Example 2: Table and Column
Definition**

```sql
CREATE TABLE t1
(
    c1 CHAR(10) CHARACTER SET latin1
) DEFAULT CHARACTER SET latin1 COLLATE latin1_danish_ci;
```

This time we have a column with a `latin1`
character set and a default collation. Although it might seem
natural, the default collation is not taken from the table
level. Instead, because the default collation for
`latin1` is always
`latin1_swedish_ci`, column
`c1` has a collation of
`latin1_swedish_ci` (not
`latin1_danish_ci`).

**Example 3: Table and Column
Definition**

```sql
CREATE TABLE t1
(
    c1 CHAR(10)
) DEFAULT CHARACTER SET latin1 COLLATE latin1_danish_ci;
```

We have a column with a default character set and a default
collation. In this circumstance, MySQL checks the table level to
determine the column character set and collation. Consequently,
the character set for column `c1` is
`latin1` and its collation is
`latin1_danish_ci`.

**Example 4: Database, Table, and Column
Definition**

```sql
CREATE DATABASE d1
    DEFAULT CHARACTER SET latin2 COLLATE latin2_czech_cs;
USE d1;
CREATE TABLE t1
(
    c1 CHAR(10)
);
```

We create a column without specifying its character set and
collation. We're also not specifying a character set and a
collation at the table level. In this circumstance, MySQL checks
the database level to determine the table settings, which
thereafter become the column settings.) Consequently, the
character set for column `c1` is
`latin2` and its collation is
`latin2_czech_cs`.
