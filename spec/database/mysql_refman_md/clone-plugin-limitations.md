#### 7.6.7.14 Clone Plugin Limitations

The clone plugin is subject to these limitations:

- An instance cannot be cloned from a different MySQL server
  series. For example, you cannot clone between MySQL 8.0 and
  MySQL 8.4, but can clone within a series such as MySQL
  8.0.37 and MySQL 8.0.42. Before 8.0.37, the point release
  number also had to match, so cloning the likes of 8.0.36 to
  8.0.42 or vice-versa is not permitted
- Prior to MySQL 8.0.27, DDL on the donor and recipient,
  including [`TRUNCATE TABLE`](truncate-table.md "15.1.37 TRUNCATE TABLE Statement"), is
  not permitted during a cloning operation. This limitation
  should be considered when selecting data sources. A
  workaround is to use dedicated donor instances, which can
  accommodate DDL operations being blocked while data is
  cloned. Concurrent DML is permitted.

  From MySQL 8.0.27, concurrent DDL is permitted on the donor
  by default. Support for concurrent DDL on the donor is
  controlled by the
  [`clone_block_ddl`](clone-plugin-options-variables.md#sysvar_clone_block_ddl) variable.
  See [Section 7.6.7.4, “Cloning and Concurrent DDL”](clone-plugin-concurrent-ddl.md "7.6.7.4 Cloning and Concurrent DDL").
- Cloning from a donor MySQL server instance to a hotfix MySQL
  server instance of the same version and release is only
  supported with MySQL 8.0.26 and higher.
- Only a single MySQL instance can be cloned at a time.
  Cloning multiple MySQL instances in a single cloning
  operation is not supported.
- The X Protocol port specified by
  [`mysqlx_port`](x-plugin-options-system-variables.md#sysvar_mysqlx_port) is not
  supported for remote cloning operations (when specifying the
  port number of the donor MySQL server instance in a
  [`CLONE
  INSTANCE`](clone.md "15.7.5 CLONE Statement") statement).
- The clone plugin does not support cloning of MySQL server
  configurations. The recipient MySQL server instance retains
  its configuration, including persisted system variable
  settings (see [Section 7.1.9.3, “Persisted System Variables”](persisted-system-variables.md "7.1.9.3 Persisted System Variables").)
- The clone plugin does not support cloning of binary logs.
- The clone plugin only clones data stored in
  `InnoDB`. Other storage engine data is not
  cloned. [`MyISAM`](myisam-storage-engine.md "18.2 The MyISAM Storage Engine") and
  [`CSV`](csv-storage-engine.md "18.4 The CSV Storage Engine") tables stored in any schema
  including the `sys` schema are cloned as
  empty tables.
- Connecting to the donor MySQL server instance through
  MySQL Router is not supported.
- Local cloning operations do not support cloning of general
  tablespaces that were created with an absolute path. A
  cloned tablespace file with the same path as the source
  tablespace file would cause a conflict.
