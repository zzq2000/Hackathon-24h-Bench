#### 17.9.1.3 Tuning Compression for InnoDB Tables

Most often, the internal optimizations described in
[InnoDB Data Storage and Compression](innodb-compression-internals.md#innodb-compression-internals-storage "InnoDB Data Storage and Compression") ensure
that the system runs well with compressed data. However, because
the efficiency of compression depends on the nature of your
data, you can make decisions that affect the performance of
compressed tables:

- Which tables to compress.
- What compressed page size to use.
- Whether to adjust the size of the buffer pool based on
  run-time performance characteristics, such as the amount of
  time the system spends compressing and uncompressing data.
  Whether the workload is more like a
  [data warehouse](glossary.md#glos_data_warehouse "data warehouse")
  (primarily queries) or an
  [OLTP](glossary.md#glos_oltp "OLTP") system (mix of queries
  and [DML](glossary.md#glos_dml "DML")).
- If the system performs DML operations on compressed tables,
  and the way the data is distributed leads to expensive
  [compression
  failures](glossary.md#glos_compression_failure "compression failure") at runtime, you might adjust additional
  advanced configuration options.

Use the guidelines in this section to help make those
architectural and configuration choices. When you are ready to
conduct long-term testing and put compressed tables into
production, see
[Section 17.9.1.4, “Monitoring InnoDB Table Compression at Runtime”](innodb-compression-tuning-monitoring.md "17.9.1.4 Monitoring InnoDB Table Compression at Runtime") for ways
to verify the effectiveness of those choices under real-world
conditions.

##### When to Use Compression

In general, compression works best on tables that include a
reasonable number of character string columns and where the data
is read far more often than it is written. Because there are no
guaranteed ways to predict whether or not compression benefits a
particular situation, always test with a specific
[workload](glossary.md#glos_workload "workload") and data set
running on a representative configuration. Consider the
following factors when deciding which tables to compress.

##### Data Characteristics and Compression

A key determinant of the efficiency of compression in reducing
the size of data files is the nature of the data itself. Recall
that compression works by identifying repeated strings of bytes
in a block of data. Completely randomized data is the worst
case. Typical data often has repeated values, and so compresses
effectively. Character strings often compress well, whether
defined in `CHAR`, `VARCHAR`,
`TEXT` or `BLOB` columns. On
the other hand, tables containing mostly binary data (integers
or floating point numbers) or data that is previously compressed
(for example JPEG or PNG
images) may not generally compress well, significantly or at
all.

You choose whether to turn on compression for each InnoDB table.
A table and all of its indexes use the same (compressed)
[page size](glossary.md#glos_page_size "page size"). It might be
that the [primary key](glossary.md#glos_primary_key "primary key")
(clustered) index, which contains the data for all columns of a
table, compresses more effectively than the secondary indexes.
For those cases where there are long rows, the use of
compression might result in long column values being stored
“off-page”, as discussed in
[DYNAMIC Row Format](innodb-row-format.md#innodb-row-format-dynamic "DYNAMIC Row Format"). Those overflow
pages may compress well. Given these considerations, for many
applications, some tables compress more effectively than others,
and you might find that your workload performs best only with a
subset of tables compressed.

To determine whether or not to compress a particular table,
conduct experiments. You can get a rough estimate of how
efficiently your data can be compressed by using a utility that
implements LZ77 compression (such as `gzip` or
WinZip) on a copy of the [.ibd
file](glossary.md#glos_ibd_file ".ibd file") for an uncompressed table. You can expect less
compression from a MySQL compressed table than from file-based
compression tools, because MySQL compresses data in chunks based
on the [page size](glossary.md#glos_page_size "page size"), 16KB by
default. In addition to user data, the page format includes some
internal system data that is not compressed. File-based
compression utilities can examine much larger chunks of data,
and so might find more repeated strings in a huge file than
MySQL can find in an individual page.

Another way to test compression on a specific table is to copy
some data from your uncompressed table to a similar, compressed
table (having all the same indexes) in a
[file-per-table](glossary.md#glos_file_per_table "file-per-table")
tablespace and look at the size of the resulting
`.ibd` file. For example:

```sql
USE test;
SET GLOBAL innodb_file_per_table=1;
SET GLOBAL autocommit=0;

-- Create an uncompressed table with a million or two rows.
CREATE TABLE big_table AS SELECT * FROM information_schema.columns;
INSERT INTO big_table SELECT * FROM big_table;
INSERT INTO big_table SELECT * FROM big_table;
INSERT INTO big_table SELECT * FROM big_table;
INSERT INTO big_table SELECT * FROM big_table;
INSERT INTO big_table SELECT * FROM big_table;
INSERT INTO big_table SELECT * FROM big_table;
INSERT INTO big_table SELECT * FROM big_table;
INSERT INTO big_table SELECT * FROM big_table;
INSERT INTO big_table SELECT * FROM big_table;
INSERT INTO big_table SELECT * FROM big_table;
COMMIT;
ALTER TABLE big_table ADD id int unsigned NOT NULL PRIMARY KEY auto_increment;

SHOW CREATE TABLE big_table\G

select count(id) from big_table;

-- Check how much space is needed for the uncompressed table.
\! ls -l data/test/big_table.ibd

CREATE TABLE key_block_size_4 LIKE big_table;
ALTER TABLE key_block_size_4 key_block_size=4 row_format=compressed;

INSERT INTO key_block_size_4 SELECT * FROM big_table;
commit;

-- Check how much space is needed for a compressed table
-- with particular compression settings.
\! ls -l data/test/key_block_size_4.ibd
```

This experiment produced the following numbers, which of course
could vary considerably depending on your table structure and
data:

```terminal
-rw-rw----  1 cirrus  staff  310378496 Jan  9 13:44 data/test/big_table.ibd
-rw-rw----  1 cirrus  staff  83886080 Jan  9 15:10 data/test/key_block_size_4.ibd
```

To see whether compression is efficient for your particular
[workload](glossary.md#glos_workload "workload"):

- For simple tests, use a MySQL instance with no other
  compressed tables and run queries against the Information
  Schema [`INNODB_CMP`](information-schema-innodb-cmp-table.md "28.4.6 The INFORMATION_SCHEMA INNODB_CMP and INNODB_CMP_RESET Tables") table.
- For more elaborate tests involving workloads with multiple
  compressed tables, run queries against the Information
  Schema [`INNODB_CMP_PER_INDEX`](information-schema-innodb-cmp-per-index-table.md "28.4.8 The INFORMATION_SCHEMA INNODB_CMP_PER_INDEX and INNODB_CMP_PER_INDEX_RESET Tables")
  table. Because the statistics in the
  `INNODB_CMP_PER_INDEX` table are expensive
  to collect, you must enable the configuration option
  [`innodb_cmp_per_index_enabled`](innodb-parameters.md#sysvar_innodb_cmp_per_index_enabled)
  before querying that table, and you might restrict such
  testing to a development server or a non-critical replica
  server.
- Run some typical SQL statements against the compressed table
  you are testing.
- Examine the ratio of successful compression operations to
  overall compression operations by querying
  [`INFORMATION_SCHEMA.INNODB_CMP`](information-schema-innodb-cmp-table.md "28.4.6 The INFORMATION_SCHEMA INNODB_CMP and INNODB_CMP_RESET Tables")
  or
  [`INFORMATION_SCHEMA.INNODB_CMP_PER_INDEX`](information-schema-innodb-cmp-per-index-table.md "28.4.8 The INFORMATION_SCHEMA INNODB_CMP_PER_INDEX and INNODB_CMP_PER_INDEX_RESET Tables"),
  and comparing `COMPRESS_OPS` to
  `COMPRESS_OPS_OK`.
- If a high percentage of compression operations complete
  successfully, the table might be a good candidate for
  compression.
- If you get a high proportion of
  [compression
  failures](glossary.md#glos_compression_failure "compression failure"), you can adjust
  [`innodb_compression_level`](innodb-parameters.md#sysvar_innodb_compression_level),
  [`innodb_compression_failure_threshold_pct`](innodb-parameters.md#sysvar_innodb_compression_failure_threshold_pct),
  and
  [`innodb_compression_pad_pct_max`](innodb-parameters.md#sysvar_innodb_compression_pad_pct_max)
  options as described in
  [Section 17.9.1.6, “Compression for OLTP Workloads”](innodb-performance-compression-oltp.md "17.9.1.6 Compression for OLTP Workloads"), and
  try further tests.

##### Database Compression versus Application Compression

Decide whether to compress data in your application or in the
table; do not use both types of compression for the same data.
When you compress the data in the application and store the
results in a compressed table, extra space savings are extremely
unlikely, and the double compression just wastes CPU cycles.

##### Compressing in the Database

When enabled, MySQL table compression is automatic and applies
to all columns and index values. The columns can still be tested
with operators such as `LIKE`, and sort
operations can still use indexes even when the index values are
compressed. Because indexes are often a significant fraction of
the total size of a database, compression could result in
significant savings in storage, I/O or processor time. The
compression and decompression operations happen on the database
server, which likely is a powerful system that is sized to
handle the expected load.

##### Compressing in the Application

If you compress data such as text in your application, before it
is inserted into the database, You might save overhead for data
that does not compress well by compressing some columns and not
others. This approach uses CPU cycles for compression and
uncompression on the client machine rather than the database
server, which might be appropriate for a distributed application
with many clients, or where the client machine has spare CPU
cycles.

##### Hybrid Approach

Of course, it is possible to combine these approaches. For some
applications, it may be appropriate to use some compressed
tables and some uncompressed tables. It may be best to
externally compress some data (and store it in uncompressed
tables) and allow MySQL to compress (some of) the other tables
in the application. As always, up-front design and real-life
testing are valuable in reaching the right decision.

##### Workload Characteristics and Compression

In addition to choosing which tables to compress (and the page
size), the workload is another key determinant of performance.
If the application is dominated by reads, rather than updates,
fewer pages need to be reorganized and recompressed after the
index page runs out of room for the per-page “modification
log” that MySQL maintains for compressed data. If the
updates predominantly change non-indexed columns or those
containing `BLOB`s or large strings that happen
to be stored “off-page”, the overhead of
compression may be acceptable. If the only changes to a table
are `INSERT`s that use a monotonically
increasing primary key, and there are few secondary indexes,
there is little need to reorganize and recompress index pages.
Since MySQL can “delete-mark” and delete rows on
compressed pages “in place” by modifying
uncompressed data, `DELETE` operations on a
table are relatively efficient.

For some environments, the time it takes to load data can be as
important as run-time retrieval. Especially in data warehouse
environments, many tables may be read-only or read-mostly. In
those cases, it might or might not be acceptable to pay the
price of compression in terms of increased load time, unless the
resulting savings in fewer disk reads or in storage cost is
significant.

Fundamentally, compression works best when the CPU time is
available for compressing and uncompressing data. Thus, if your
workload is I/O bound, rather than CPU-bound, you might find
that compression can improve overall performance. When you test
your application performance with different compression
configurations, test on a platform similar to the planned
configuration of the production system.

##### Configuration Characteristics and Compression

Reading and writing database
[pages](glossary.md#glos_page "page") from and to disk is the
slowest aspect of system performance. Compression attempts to
reduce I/O by using CPU time to compress and uncompress data,
and is most effective when I/O is a relatively scarce resource
compared to processor cycles.

This is often especially the case when running in a multi-user
environment with fast, multi-core CPUs. When a page of a
compressed table is in memory, MySQL often uses additional
memory, typically 16KB, in the
[buffer pool](glossary.md#glos_buffer_pool "buffer pool") for an
uncompressed copy of the page. The adaptive LRU algorithm
attempts to balance the use of memory between compressed and
uncompressed pages to take into account whether the workload is
running in an I/O-bound or CPU-bound manner. Still, a
configuration with more memory dedicated to the buffer pool
tends to run better when using compressed tables than a
configuration where memory is highly constrained.

##### Choosing the Compressed Page Size

The optimal setting of the compressed page size depends on the
type and distribution of data that the table and its indexes
contain. The compressed page size should always be bigger than
the maximum record size, or operations may fail as noted in
[Compression of B-Tree Pages](innodb-compression-internals.md#innodb-compression-internals-storage-btree "Compression of B-Tree Pages").

Setting the compressed page size too large wastes some space,
but the pages do not have to be compressed as often. If the
compressed page size is set too small, inserts or updates may
require time-consuming recompression, and the
[B-tree](glossary.md#glos_b_tree "B-tree") nodes may have to be
split more frequently, leading to bigger data files and less
efficient indexing.

Typically, you set the compressed page size to 8K or 4K bytes.
Given that the maximum row size for an InnoDB table is around
8K, `KEY_BLOCK_SIZE=8` is usually a safe
choice.
