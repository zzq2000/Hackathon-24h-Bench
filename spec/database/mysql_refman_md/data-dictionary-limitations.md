## 16.8 Data Dictionary Limitations

This section describes temporary limitations introduced with the
MySQL data dictionary.

- Manual creation of database directories under the data
  directory (for example, with **mkdir**) is
  unsupported. Manually created database directories are not
  recognized by the MySQL Server.
- DDL operations take longer due to writing to storage, undo
  logs, and redo logs instead of `.frm`
  files.
