#### 30.4.3.14 The io\_global\_by\_wait\_by\_latency and x$io\_global\_by\_wait\_by\_latency Views

These views summarize global I/O consumers to display amount
of I/O and time waiting for I/O, grouped by event. By default,
rows are sorted by descending total latency.

The [`io_global_by_wait_by_latency`](sys-io-global-by-wait-by-latency.md "30.4.3.14 The io_global_by_wait_by_latency and x$io_global_by_wait_by_latency Views")
and
[`x$io_global_by_wait_by_latency`](sys-io-global-by-wait-by-latency.md "30.4.3.14 The io_global_by_wait_by_latency and x$io_global_by_wait_by_latency Views")
views have these columns:

- `event_name`

  The I/O event name, with the
  `wait/io/file/` prefix stripped.
- `total`

  The total number of occurrences of the I/O event.
- `total_latency`

  The total wait time of timed occurrences of the I/O event.
- `avg_latency`

  The average wait time per timed occurrence of the I/O
  event.
- `max_latency`

  The maximum single wait time of timed occurrences of the
  I/O event.
- `read_latency`

  The total wait time of timed read occurrences of the I/O
  event.
- `write_latency`

  The total wait time of timed write occurrences of the I/O
  event.
- `misc_latency`

  The total wait time of timed other occurrences of the I/O
  event.
- `count_read`

  The number of read requests for the I/O event.
- `total_read`

  The number of bytes read for the I/O event.
- `avg_read`

  The average number of bytes per read for the I/O event.
- `count_write`

  The number of write requests for the I/O event.
- `total_written`

  The number of bytes written for the I/O event.
- `avg_written`

  The average number of bytes per write for the I/O event.
