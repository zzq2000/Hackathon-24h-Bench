#### 29.12.21.10 The user\_defined\_functions Table

The [`user_defined_functions`](performance-schema-user-defined-functions-table.md "29.12.21.10 The user_defined_functions Table") table
contains a row for each loadable function registered
automatically by a component or plugin, or manually by a
[`CREATE
FUNCTION`](create-function-loadable.md "15.7.4.1 CREATE FUNCTION Statement for Loadable Functions") statement. For information about operations
that add or remove table rows, see
[Section 7.7.1, “Installing and Uninstalling Loadable Functions”](function-loading.md "7.7.1 Installing and Uninstalling Loadable Functions").

Note

The name of the
[`user_defined_functions`](performance-schema-user-defined-functions-table.md "29.12.21.10 The user_defined_functions Table") table
stems from the terminology used at its inception for the
type of function now known as a loadable function (that is,
user-defined function, or UDF).

The [`user_defined_functions`](performance-schema-user-defined-functions-table.md "29.12.21.10 The user_defined_functions Table") table
has these columns:

- `UDF_NAME`

  The function name as referred to in SQL statements. The
  value is `NULL` if the function was
  registered by a [`CREATE
  FUNCTION`](create-function.md "15.1.14 CREATE FUNCTION Statement") statement and is in the process of
  unloading.
- `UDF_RETURN_TYPE`

  The function return value type. The value is one of
  `int`, `decimal`,
  `real`, `char`, or
  `row`.
- `UDF_TYPE`

  The function type. The value is one of
  `function` (scalar) or
  `aggregate`.
- `UDF_LIBRARY`

  The name of the library file containing the executable
  function code. The file is located in the directory named
  by the [`plugin_dir`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_plugin_dir) system
  variable. The value is `NULL` if the
  function was registered by a component or plugin rather
  than by a [`CREATE FUNCTION`](create-function.md "15.1.14 CREATE FUNCTION Statement")
  statement.
- `UDF_USAGE_COUNT`

  The current function usage count. This is used to tell
  whether statements currently are accessing the function.

The [`user_defined_functions`](performance-schema-user-defined-functions-table.md "29.12.21.10 The user_defined_functions Table") table
has these indexes:

- Primary key on (`UDF_NAME`)

[`TRUNCATE TABLE`](truncate-table.md "15.1.37 TRUNCATE TABLE Statement") is not permitted
for the [`user_defined_functions`](performance-schema-user-defined-functions-table.md "29.12.21.10 The user_defined_functions Table")
table.

The `mysql.func` system table also lists
installed loadable functions, but only those installed using
[`CREATE
FUNCTION`](create-function-loadable.md "15.7.4.1 CREATE FUNCTION Statement for Loadable Functions"). The
[`user_defined_functions`](performance-schema-user-defined-functions-table.md "29.12.21.10 The user_defined_functions Table") table
lists loadable functions installed using
[`CREATE
FUNCTION`](create-function-loadable.md "15.7.4.1 CREATE FUNCTION Statement for Loadable Functions") as well as loadable functions installed
automatically by components or plugins. This difference makes
[`user_defined_functions`](performance-schema-user-defined-functions-table.md "29.12.21.10 The user_defined_functions Table") preferable
to `mysql.func` for checking which loadable
functions are installed.
