#### 19.5.1.34 Replication and Transaction Inconsistencies

Inconsistencies in the sequence of transactions that have been
executed from the relay log can occur depending on your
replication configuration. This section explains how to avoid
inconsistencies and solve any problems they cause.

The following types of inconsistencies can exist:

- *Half-applied transactions*. A
  transaction which updates non-transactional tables has
  applied some but not all of its changes.
- *Gaps*. A gap in the externalized
  transaction set appears when, given an ordered sequence of
  transactions, a transaction that is later in the sequence is
  applied before some other transaction that is prior in the
  sequence. Gaps can only appear when using a multithreaded
  replica.

  To avoid gaps occurring on a multithreaded replica, set
  [`replica_preserve_commit_order=ON`](replication-options-replica.md#sysvar_replica_preserve_commit_order)
  (from MySQL 8.0.26) or
  [`slave_preserve_commit_order=ON`](replication-options-replica.md#sysvar_slave_preserve_commit_order)
  (before MySQL 8.0.26). From MySQL 8.0.27, this setting is
  the default, because all replicas are multithreaded by
  default from that release.

  Up to and including MySQL 8.0.18, preserving the commit
  order requires that binary logging
  ([`log_bin`](replication-options-binary-log.md#sysvar_log_bin)) and replica
  update logging
  ([`log_replica_updates`](replication-options-binary-log.md#sysvar_log_replica_updates) or
  [`log_slave_updates`](replication-options-binary-log.md#sysvar_log_slave_updates)) are also
  enabled, which are the default settings from MySQL 8.0. From
  MySQL 8.0.19, binary logging and replica update logging are
  not required on the replica to set
  [`replica_preserve_commit_order=ON`](replication-options-replica.md#sysvar_replica_preserve_commit_order)
  or
  [`slave_preserve_commit_order=ON`](replication-options-replica.md#sysvar_slave_preserve_commit_order),
  and can be disabled if wanted.

  In all releases, setting
  [`replica_preserve_commit_order=ON`](replication-options-replica.md#sysvar_replica_preserve_commit_order)
  or
  [`slave_preserve_commit_order=ON`](replication-options-replica.md#sysvar_slave_preserve_commit_order)
  requires that
  [`replica_parallel_type`](replication-options-replica.md#sysvar_replica_parallel_type) (from
  MySQL 8.0.26) or
  [`slave_parallel_type`](replication-options-replica.md#sysvar_slave_parallel_type) (before
  MySQL 8.0.26) is set to `LOGICAL_CLOCK`.
  From MySQL 8.0.27 (but not for earlier releases), this is
  the default setting.

  In some specific situations, as listed in the description
  for
  [`replica_preserve_commit_order`](replication-options-replica.md#sysvar_replica_preserve_commit_order)
  and
  [`slave_preserve_commit_order`](replication-options-replica.md#sysvar_slave_preserve_commit_order),
  setting
  [`replica_preserve_commit_order=ON`](replication-options-replica.md#sysvar_replica_preserve_commit_order)
  or
  [`slave_preserve_commit_order=ON`](replication-options-replica.md#sysvar_slave_preserve_commit_order)
  cannot preserve commit order on the replica, so in these
  cases gaps might still appear in the sequence of
  transactions that have been executed from the replica's
  relay log.

  Setting `replica_preserve_commit_order=ON`
  or `slave_preserve_commit_order=ON` does
  not prevent source binary log position lag.
- *Source binary log position lag*. Even in
  the absence of gaps, it is possible that transactions after
  `Exec_master_log_pos` have been applied.
  That is, all transactions up to point `N`
  have been applied, and no transactions after
  `N` have been applied, but
  `Exec_master_log_pos` has a value smaller
  than `N`. In this situation,
  `Exec_master_log_pos` is a “low-water
  mark” of the transactions applied, and lags behind
  the position of the most recently applied transaction. This
  can only happen on multithreaded replicas. Enabling
  [`replica_preserve_commit_order`](replication-options-replica.md#sysvar_replica_preserve_commit_order)
  or
  [`slave_preserve_commit_order`](replication-options-replica.md#sysvar_slave_preserve_commit_order)
  does not prevent source binary log position lag.

The following scenarios are relevant to the existence of
half-applied transactions, gaps, and source binary log position
lag:

1. While replication threads are running, there may be gaps and
   half-applied transactions.
2. [**mysqld**](mysqld.md "6.3.1 mysqld — The MySQL Server") shuts down. Both clean and unclean
   shutdown abort ongoing transactions and may leave gaps and
   half-applied transactions.
3. [`KILL`](kill.md "15.7.8.4 KILL Statement") of replication threads
   (the SQL thread when using a single-threaded replica, the
   coordinator thread when using a multithreaded replica). This
   aborts ongoing transactions and may leave gaps and
   half-applied transactions.
4. Error in applier threads. This may leave gaps. If the error
   is in a mixed transaction, that transaction is half-applied.
   When using a multithreaded replica, workers which have not
   received an error complete their queues, so it may take time
   to stop all threads.
5. [`STOP REPLICA`](stop-replica.md "15.4.2.8 STOP REPLICA Statement") when using a
   multithreaded replica. After issuing
   [`STOP REPLICA`](stop-replica.md "15.4.2.8 STOP REPLICA Statement"), the replica
   waits for any gaps to be filled and then updates
   `Exec_master_log_pos`. This ensures it
   never leaves gaps or source binary log position lag, unless
   any of the cases above applies, in other words, before
   [`STOP REPLICA`](stop-replica.md "15.4.2.8 STOP REPLICA Statement") completes,
   either an error happens, or another thread issues
   [`KILL`](kill.md "15.7.8.4 KILL Statement"), or the server restarts.
   In these cases, [`STOP REPLICA`](stop-replica.md "15.4.2.8 STOP REPLICA Statement")
   returns successfully.
6. If the last transaction in the relay log is only
   half-received and the multithreaded replica's coordinator
   thread has started to schedule the transaction to a worker,
   then [`STOP REPLICA`](stop-replica.md "15.4.2.8 STOP REPLICA Statement") waits up to
   60 seconds for the transaction to be received. After this
   timeout, the coordinator gives up and aborts the
   transaction. If the transaction is mixed, it may be left
   half-completed.
7. [`STOP REPLICA`](stop-replica.md "15.4.2.8 STOP REPLICA Statement") when the ongoing
   transaction updates transactional tables only, in which case
   it is rolled back and [`STOP
   REPLICA`](stop-replica.md "15.4.2.8 STOP REPLICA Statement") stops immediately. If the ongoing
   transaction is mixed, [`STOP
   REPLICA`](stop-replica.md "15.4.2.8 STOP REPLICA Statement") waits up to 60 seconds for the transaction
   to complete. After this timeout, it aborts the transaction,
   so it may be left half-completed.

The global setting for the system variable
[`rpl_stop_replica_timeout`](replication-options-replica.md#sysvar_rpl_stop_replica_timeout) (from
MySQL 8.0.26) or
[`rpl_stop_slave_timeout`](replication-options-replica.md#sysvar_rpl_stop_slave_timeout) (before
MySQL 8.0.26) is unrelated to the process of stopping the
replication threads. It only makes the client that issues
[`STOP REPLICA`](stop-replica.md "15.4.2.8 STOP REPLICA Statement") return to the
client, but the replication threads continue to try to stop.

If a replication channel has gaps, it has the following
consequences:

1. The replica database is in a state that may never have
   existed on the source.
2. The field `Exec_master_log_pos` in
   [`SHOW REPLICA STATUS`](show-replica-status.md "15.7.7.35 SHOW REPLICA STATUS Statement") is only a
   “low-water mark”. In other words, transactions
   appearing before the position are guaranteed to have
   committed, but transactions after the position may have
   committed or not.
3. [`CHANGE REPLICATION SOURCE TO`](change-replication-source-to.md "15.4.2.3 CHANGE REPLICATION SOURCE TO Statement")
   and [`CHANGE MASTER TO`](change-master-to.md "15.4.2.1 CHANGE MASTER TO Statement")
   statements for that channel fail with an error, unless the
   applier threads are running and the statement only sets
   receiver options.
4. If [**mysqld**](mysqld.md "6.3.1 mysqld — The MySQL Server") is started with
   [`--relay-log-recovery`](replication-options-replica.md#sysvar_relay_log_recovery), no
   recovery is done for that channel, and a warning is printed.
5. If [**mysqldump**](mysqldump.md "6.5.4 mysqldump — A Database Backup Program") is used with
   [`--dump-replica`](mysqldump.md#option_mysqldump_dump-replica) or
   [`--dump-slave`](mysqldump.md#option_mysqldump_dump-slave), it does not
   record the existence of gaps; thus it prints
   [`CHANGE REPLICATION SOURCE TO`](change-replication-source-to.md "15.4.2.3 CHANGE REPLICATION SOURCE TO Statement")
   | [`CHANGE MASTER TO`](change-master-to.md "15.4.2.1 CHANGE MASTER TO Statement") with
   `RELAY_LOG_POS` set to the “low-water
   mark” position in
   `Exec_master_log_pos`.

   After applying the dump on another server, and starting the
   replication threads, transactions appearing after the
   position are replicated again. Note that this is harmless if
   GTIDs are enabled (however, in that case it is not
   recommended to use
   [`--dump-replica`](mysqldump.md#option_mysqldump_dump-replica) or
   [`--dump-slave`](mysqldump.md#option_mysqldump_dump-slave)).

If a replication channel has source binary log position lag but
no gaps, cases 2 to 5 above apply, but case 1 does not.

The source binary log position information is persisted in
binary format in the internal table
`mysql.slave_worker_info`.
[`START REPLICA
[SQL_THREAD]`](start-replica.md "15.4.2.6 START REPLICA Statement") always consults this information so that
it applies only the correct transactions. This remains true even
if [`replica_parallel_workers`](replication-options-replica.md#sysvar_replica_parallel_workers) or
[`slave_parallel_workers`](replication-options-replica.md#sysvar_slave_parallel_workers) has been
changed to 0 before [`START
REPLICA`](start-replica.md "15.4.2.6 START REPLICA Statement"), and even if [`START
REPLICA`](start-replica.md "15.4.2.6 START REPLICA Statement") is used with `UNTIL` clauses.
[`START REPLICA
UNTIL SQL_AFTER_MTS_GAPS`](start-replica.md "15.4.2.6 START REPLICA Statement") only applies as many
transactions as needed in order to fill in the gaps. If
[`START REPLICA`](start-replica.md "15.4.2.6 START REPLICA Statement") is used with
`UNTIL` clauses that tell it to stop before it
has consumed all the gaps, then it leaves remaining gaps.

Warning

[`RESET REPLICA`](reset-replica.md "15.4.2.4 RESET REPLICA Statement") removes the relay
logs and resets the replication position. Thus issuing
[`RESET REPLICA`](reset-replica.md "15.4.2.4 RESET REPLICA Statement") on a
multithreaded replica with gaps means the replica loses any
information about the gaps, without correcting the gaps. In
this situation, if binary log position based replication is in
use, the recovery process fails.

When GTID-based replication is in use
([`GTID_MODE=ON`](replication-options-gtids.md#sysvar_gtid_mode)) and
`SOURCE_AUTO_POSITION` is set for the
replication channel using the [`CHANGE
REPLICATION SOURCE TO`](change-replication-source-to.md "15.4.2.3 CHANGE REPLICATION SOURCE TO Statement") statement, the old relay logs
are not required for the recovery process. Instead, the replica
can use GTID auto-positioning to calculate what transactions it
is missing compared to the source. From MySQL 8.0.26, the
process used for binary log position based replication to
resolve gaps on a multithreaded replica is skipped entirely when
GTID-based replication is in use. When the process is skipped, a
[`START REPLICA
UNTIL SQL_AFTER_MTS_GAPS`](start-replica.md "15.4.2.6 START REPLICA Statement") statement behaves
differently, and does not attempt to check for gaps in the
sequence of transactions. You can also issue
[`CHANGE REPLICATION SOURCE TO`](change-replication-source-to.md "15.4.2.3 CHANGE REPLICATION SOURCE TO Statement")
statements, which are not permitted on a non-GTID replica where
there are gaps.
