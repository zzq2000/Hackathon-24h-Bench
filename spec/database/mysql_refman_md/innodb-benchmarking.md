### 17.1.4 Testing and Benchmarking with InnoDB

If `InnoDB` is not the default storage engine,
you can determine if your database server and applications work
correctly with `InnoDB` by restarting the server
with
[`--default-storage-engine=InnoDB`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_default_storage_engine)
defined on the command line or with
[`default-storage-engine=innodb`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_default_storage_engine)
defined in the `[mysqld]` section of the MySQL
server option file.

Since changing the default storage engine only affects newly
created tables, run your application installation and setup steps
to confirm that everything installs properly, then exercise the
application features to make sure the data loading, editing, and
querying features work. If a table relies on a feature that is
specific to another storage engine, you receive an error. In this
case, add the
`ENGINE=other_engine_name`
clause to the [`CREATE TABLE`](create-table.md "15.1.20 CREATE TABLE Statement")
statement to avoid the error.

If you did not make a deliberate decision about the storage
engine, and you want to preview how certain tables work when
created using `InnoDB`, issue the command
[`ALTER TABLE
table_name ENGINE=InnoDB;`](alter-table.md "15.1.9 ALTER TABLE Statement") for each table. Alternatively,
to run test queries and other statements without disturbing the
original table, make a copy:

```sql
CREATE TABLE ... ENGINE=InnoDB AS SELECT * FROM other_engine_table;
```

To assess performance with a full application under a realistic
workload, install the latest MySQL server and run benchmarks.

Test the full application lifecycle, from installation, through
heavy usage, and server restart. Kill the server process while the
database is busy to simulate a power failure, and verify that the
data is recovered successfully when you restart the server.

Test any replication configurations, especially if you use
different MySQL versions and options on the source server and
replicas.
