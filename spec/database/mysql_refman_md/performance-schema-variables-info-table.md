#### 29.12.14.2 Performance Schema variables\_info Table

The [`variables_info`](performance-schema-variables-info-table.md "29.12.14.2 Performance Schema variables_info Table") table shows,
for each system variable, the source from which it was most
recently set, and its range of values.

The [`variables_info`](performance-schema-variables-info-table.md "29.12.14.2 Performance Schema variables_info Table") table has
these columns:

- `VARIABLE_NAME`

  The variable name.
- `VARIABLE_SOURCE`

  The source from which the variable was most recently set:

  - `COMMAND_LINE`

    The variable was set on the command line.
  - `COMPILED`

    The variable has its compiled-in default value.
    `COMPILED` is the value used for
    variables not set any other way.
  - `DYNAMIC`

    The variable was set at runtime. This includes
    variables set within files specified using the
    [`init_file`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_init_file) system
    variable.
  - `EXPLICIT`

    The variable was set from an option file named with
    the [`--defaults-file`](server-options.md#option_mysqld_defaults-file)
    option.
  - `EXTRA`

    The variable was set from an option file named with
    the
    [`--defaults-extra-file`](server-options.md#option_mysqld_defaults-extra-file)
    option.
  - `GLOBAL`

    The variable was set from a global option file. This
    includes option files not covered by
    `EXPLICIT`, `EXTRA`,
    `LOGIN`,
    `PERSISTED`,
    `SERVER`, or `USER`.
  - `LOGIN`

    The variable was set from a user-specific login path
    file (`~/.mylogin.cnf`).
  - `PERSISTED`

    The variable was set from a server-specific
    `mysqld-auto.cnf` option file. No
    row has this value if the server was started with
    [`persisted_globals_load`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_persisted_globals_load)
    disabled.
  - `SERVER`

    The variable was set from a server-specific
    `$MYSQL_HOME/my.cnf`
    option file. For details about how
    `MYSQL_HOME` is set, see
    [Section 6.2.2.2, “Using Option Files”](option-files.md "6.2.2.2 Using Option Files").
  - `USER`

    The variable was set from a user-specific
    `~/.my.cnf` option file.
- `VARIABLE_PATH`

  If the variable was set from an option file,
  `VARIABLE_PATH` is the path name of that
  file. Otherwise, the value is the empty string.
- `MIN_VALUE`

  The minimum permitted value for the variable. For a
  variable whose type is not numeric, this is always 0.
- `MAX_VALUE`

  The maximum permitted value for the variable. For a
  variable whose type is not numeric, this is always 0.
- `SET_TIME`

  The time at which the variable was most recently set. The
  default is the time at which the server initialized global
  system variables during startup.
- `SET_USER`, `SET_HOST`

  The user name and host name of the client user that most
  recently set the variable. If a client connects as
  `user17` from host
  `host34.example.com` using the account
  `'user17'@'%.example.com`,
  `SET_USER` and
  `SET_HOST` are `user17`
  and `host34.example.com`, respectively.
  For proxy user connections, these values correspond to the
  external (proxy) user, not the proxied user against which
  privilege checking is performed. The default for each
  column is the empty string, indicating that the variable
  has not been set since server startup.

The [`variables_info`](performance-schema-variables-info-table.md "29.12.14.2 Performance Schema variables_info Table") table has no
indexes.

[`TRUNCATE TABLE`](truncate-table.md "15.1.37 TRUNCATE TABLE Statement") is not permitted
for the [`variables_info`](performance-schema-variables-info-table.md "29.12.14.2 Performance Schema variables_info Table") table.

If a variable with a `VARIABLE_SOURCE` value
other than `DYNAMIC` is set at runtime,
`VARIABLE_SOURCE` becomes
`DYNAMIC` and
`VARIABLE_PATH` becomes the empty string.

A system variable that has only a session value (such as
[`debug_sync`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_debug_sync)) cannot be set at
startup or persisted. For session-only system variables,
`VARIABLE_SOURCE` can be only
`COMPILED` or `DYNAMIC`.

If a system variable has an unexpected
`VARIABLE_SOURCE` value, consider your server
startup method. For example, [**mysqld\_safe**](mysqld-safe.md "6.3.2 mysqld_safe — MySQL Server Startup Script")
reads option files and passes certain options it finds there
as part of the command line that it uses to start
[**mysqld**](mysqld.md "6.3.1 mysqld — The MySQL Server"). Consequently, some system variables
that you set in option files might display in
[`variables_info`](performance-schema-variables-info-table.md "29.12.14.2 Performance Schema variables_info Table") as
`COMMAND_LINE`, rather than as
`GLOBAL` or `SERVER` as you
might otherwise expect.

Some sample queries that use the
[`variables_info`](performance-schema-variables-info-table.md "29.12.14.2 Performance Schema variables_info Table") table, with
representative output:

- Display variables set on the command line:

  ```sql
  mysql> SELECT VARIABLE_NAME
         FROM performance_schema.variables_info
         WHERE VARIABLE_SOURCE = 'COMMAND_LINE'
         ORDER BY VARIABLE_NAME;

  | basedir       |
  | datadir       |

  | pid_file      |
  | plugin_dir    |
  | port          |
  +---------------+
  ```
- Display variables set from persistent storage:

  ```sql
  mysql> SELECT VARIABLE_NAME

         WHERE VARIABLE_SOURCE = 'PERSISTED'
         ORDER BY VARIABLE_NAME;
  +--------------------------+

- Join [`variables_info`](performance-schema-variables-info-table.md "29.12.14.2 Performance Schema variables_info Table") with the
  [`global_variables`](performance-schema-system-variable-tables.md "29.12.14 Performance Schema System Variable Tables") table to
  display the current values of persisted variables,
  together with their range of values:

  ```sql
  mysql> SELECT
           VI.VARIABLE_NAME, GV.VARIABLE_VALUE,
           VI.MIN_VALUE,VI.MAX_VALUE
         FROM performance_schema.variables_info AS VI
           INNER JOIN performance_schema.global_variables AS GV
