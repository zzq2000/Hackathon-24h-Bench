### 7.1.10 Server Status Variables

The MySQL server maintains many status variables that provide
information about its operation. You can view these variables and
their values by using the `SHOW [GLOBAL | SESSION]
STATUS` statement (see [Section 15.7.7.37, “SHOW STATUS Statement”](show-status.md "15.7.7.37 SHOW STATUS Statement")).
The optional `GLOBAL` keyword aggregates the
values over all connections, and `SESSION` shows
the values for the current connection.

```sql
mysql> SHOW GLOBAL STATUS;
+-----------------------------------+------------+
| Variable_name                     | Value      |
+-----------------------------------+------------+
| Aborted_clients                   | 0          |
| Aborted_connects                  | 0          |
| Bytes_received                    | 155372598  |

| Uptime                            | 1389872    |
+-----------------------------------+------------+
```

Many status variables are reset to 0 by the
[`FLUSH STATUS`](flush.md#flush-status) statement.

This section provides a description of each status variable. For a
status variable summary, see
[Section 7.1.6, “Server Status Variable Reference”](server-status-variable-reference.md "7.1.6 Server Status Variable Reference"). For
information about status variables specific to NDB Cluster, see
[Section 25.4.3.9.3, “NDB Cluster Status Variables”](mysql-cluster-options-variables.md#mysql-cluster-status-variables "25.4.3.9.3 NDB Cluster Status Variables").

The status variables have the following meanings.

- [`Aborted_clients`](server-status-variables.md#statvar_Aborted_clients)

  The number of connections that were aborted because the client
  died without closing the connection properly. See
  [Section B.3.2.9, “Communication Errors and Aborted Connections”](communication-errors.md "B.3.2.9 Communication Errors and Aborted Connections").
- [`Aborted_connects`](server-status-variables.md#statvar_Aborted_connects)

  The number of failed attempts to connect to the MySQL server.
  See [Section B.3.2.9, “Communication Errors and Aborted Connections”](communication-errors.md "B.3.2.9 Communication Errors and Aborted Connections").

  For additional connection-related information, check the
  [`Connection_errors_xxx`](server-status-variables.md#statvar_Connection_errors_xxx)
  status variables and the
  [`host_cache`](performance-schema-host-cache-table.md "29.12.21.3 The host_cache Table") table.
- [`Authentication_ldap_sasl_supported_methods`](server-status-variables.md#statvar_Authentication_ldap_sasl_supported_methods)

  The `authentication_ldap_sasl` plugin that
  implements SASL LDAP authentication supports multiple
  authentication methods, but depending on host system
  configuration, they might not all be available. The
  [`Authentication_ldap_sasl_supported_methods`](server-status-variables.md#statvar_Authentication_ldap_sasl_supported_methods)
  variable provides discoverability for the supported methods.
  Its value is a string consisting of supported method names
  separated by spaces. Example: `"SCRAM-SHA 1
  SCRAM-SHA-256 GSSAPI"`

  This variable was added in MySQL 8.0.21.
- [`Binlog_cache_disk_use`](server-status-variables.md#statvar_Binlog_cache_disk_use)

  The number of transactions that used the temporary binary log
  cache but that exceeded the value of
  [`binlog_cache_size`](replication-options-binary-log.md#sysvar_binlog_cache_size) and used a
  temporary file to store statements from the transaction.

  The number of nontransactional statements that caused the
  binary log transaction cache to be written to disk is tracked
  separately in the
  [`Binlog_stmt_cache_disk_use`](server-status-variables.md#statvar_Binlog_stmt_cache_disk_use)
  status variable.
- [`Acl_cache_items_count`](server-status-variables.md#statvar_Acl_cache_items_count)

  The number of cached privilege objects. Each object is the
  privilege combination of a user and its active roles.
- [`Binlog_cache_use`](server-status-variables.md#statvar_Binlog_cache_use)

  The number of transactions that used the binary log cache.
- [`Binlog_stmt_cache_disk_use`](server-status-variables.md#statvar_Binlog_stmt_cache_disk_use)

  The number of nontransaction statements that used the binary
  log statement cache but that exceeded the value of
  [`binlog_stmt_cache_size`](replication-options-binary-log.md#sysvar_binlog_stmt_cache_size) and
  used a temporary file to store those statements.
- [`Binlog_stmt_cache_use`](server-status-variables.md#statvar_Binlog_stmt_cache_use)

  The number of nontransactional statements that used the binary
  log statement cache.
- [`Bytes_received`](server-status-variables.md#statvar_Bytes_received)

  The number of bytes received from all clients.
- [`Bytes_sent`](server-status-variables.md#statvar_Bytes_sent)

  The number of bytes sent to all clients.
- [`Caching_sha2_password_rsa_public_key`](server-status-variables.md#statvar_Caching_sha2_password_rsa_public_key)

  The public key used by the
  `caching_sha2_password` authentication plugin
  for RSA key pair-based password exchange. The value is
  nonempty only if the server successfully initializes the
  private and public keys in the files named by the
  [`caching_sha2_password_private_key_path`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_caching_sha2_password_private_key_path)
  and
  [`caching_sha2_password_public_key_path`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_caching_sha2_password_public_key_path)
  system variables. The value of
  [`Caching_sha2_password_rsa_public_key`](server-status-variables.md#statvar_Caching_sha2_password_rsa_public_key)
  comes from the latter file.
- `Com_xxx`

  The `Com_xxx`
  statement counter variables indicate the number of times each
  *`xxx`* statement has been executed.
  There is one status variable for each type of statement. For
  example, `Com_delete` and
  `Com_update` count
  [`DELETE`](delete.md "15.2.2 DELETE Statement") and
  [`UPDATE`](update.md "15.2.17 UPDATE Statement") statements,
  respectively. `Com_delete_multi` and
  `Com_update_multi` are similar but apply to
  [`DELETE`](delete.md "15.2.2 DELETE Statement") and
  [`UPDATE`](update.md "15.2.17 UPDATE Statement") statements that use
  multiple-table syntax.

  All `Com_stmt_xxx`
  variables are increased even if a prepared statement argument
  is unknown or an error occurred during execution. In other
  words, their values correspond to the number of requests
  issued, not to the number of requests successfully completed.
  For example, because status variables are initialized for each
  server startup and do not persist across restarts, the
  `Com_restart` and
  `Com_shutdown` variables that track
  [`RESTART`](restart.md "15.7.8.8 RESTART Statement") and
  [`SHUTDOWN`](shutdown.md "15.7.8.9 SHUTDOWN Statement") statements normally
  have a value of zero, but can be nonzero if
  [`RESTART`](restart.md "15.7.8.8 RESTART Statement") or
  [`SHUTDOWN`](shutdown.md "15.7.8.9 SHUTDOWN Statement") statements were
  executed but failed.

  The `Com_stmt_xxx`
  status variables are as follows:

  - `Com_stmt_prepare`
  - `Com_stmt_execute`
  - `Com_stmt_fetch`
  - `Com_stmt_send_long_data`
  - `Com_stmt_reset`
  - `Com_stmt_close`

  Those variables stand for prepared statement commands. Their
  names refer to the
  `COM_xxx` command
  set used in the network layer. In other words, their values
  increase whenever prepared statement API calls such as
  **mysql\_stmt\_prepare()**,
  **mysql\_stmt\_execute()**, and so forth are
  executed. However, `Com_stmt_prepare`,
  `Com_stmt_execute` and
  `Com_stmt_close` also increase for
  [`PREPARE`](prepare.md "15.5.1 PREPARE Statement"),
  [`EXECUTE`](execute.md "15.5.2 EXECUTE Statement"), or
  [`DEALLOCATE PREPARE`](deallocate-prepare.md "15.5.3 DEALLOCATE PREPARE Statement"),
  respectively. Additionally, the values of the older statement
  counter variables `Com_prepare_sql`,
  `Com_execute_sql`, and
  `Com_dealloc_sql` increase for the
  [`PREPARE`](prepare.md "15.5.1 PREPARE Statement"),
  [`EXECUTE`](execute.md "15.5.2 EXECUTE Statement"), and
  [`DEALLOCATE PREPARE`](deallocate-prepare.md "15.5.3 DEALLOCATE PREPARE Statement") statements.
  `Com_stmt_fetch` stands for the total number
  of network round-trips issued when fetching from cursors.

  `Com_stmt_reprepare` indicates the number of
  times statements were automatically reprepared by the server,
  for example, after metadata changes to tables or views
  referred to by the statement. A reprepare operation increments
  `Com_stmt_reprepare`, and also
  `Com_stmt_prepare`.

  `Com_explain_other` indicates the number of
  [`EXPLAIN FOR
  CONNECTION`](explain.md "15.8.2 EXPLAIN Statement") statements executed. See
  [Section 10.8.4, “Obtaining Execution Plan Information for a Named Connection”](explain-for-connection.md "10.8.4 Obtaining Execution Plan Information for a Named Connection").

  `Com_change_repl_filter` indicates the number
  of [`CHANGE REPLICATION FILTER`](change-replication-filter.md "15.4.2.2 CHANGE REPLICATION FILTER Statement")
  statements executed.
- [`Compression`](server-status-variables.md#statvar_Compression)

  Whether the client connection uses compression in the
  client/server protocol.

  As of MySQL 8.0.18, this status variable is deprecated; expect
  it to be removed in a future version of MySQL. See
  [Configuring Legacy Connection Compression](connection-compression-control.md#connection-compression-legacy-configuration "Configuring Legacy Connection Compression").
- [`Compression_algorithm`](server-status-variables.md#statvar_Compression_algorithm)

  The name of the compression algorithm in use for the current
  connection to the server. The value can be any algorithm
  permitted in the value of the
  [`protocol_compression_algorithms`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_protocol_compression_algorithms)
  system variable. For example, the value is
  `uncompressed` if the connection does not use
  compression, or `zlib` if the connection uses
  the `zlib` algorithm.

  For more information, see
  [Section 6.2.8, “Connection Compression Control”](connection-compression-control.md "6.2.8 Connection Compression Control").

  This variable was added in MySQL 8.0.18.
- [`Compression_level`](server-status-variables.md#statvar_Compression_level)

  The compression level in use for the current connection to the
  server. The value is 6 for `zlib` connections
  (the default `zlib` algorithm compression
  level), 1 to 22 for `zstd` connections, and 0
  for `uncompressed` connections.

  For more information, see
  [Section 6.2.8, “Connection Compression Control”](connection-compression-control.md "6.2.8 Connection Compression Control").

  This variable was added in MySQL 8.0.18.
- [`Connection_errors_xxx`](server-status-variables.md#statvar_Connection_errors_xxx)

  These variables provide information about errors that occur
  during the client connection process. They are global only and
  represent error counts aggregated across connections from all
  hosts. These variables track errors not accounted for by the
  host cache (see [Section 7.1.12.3, “DNS Lookups and the Host Cache”](host-cache.md "7.1.12.3 DNS Lookups and the Host Cache")), such as errors
  that are not associated with TCP connections, occur very early
  in the connection process (even before an IP address is
  known), or are not specific to any particular IP address (such
  as out-of-memory conditions).

  - [`Connection_errors_accept`](server-status-variables.md#statvar_Connection_errors_accept)

    The number of errors that occurred during calls to
    `accept()` on the listening port.
  - [`Connection_errors_internal`](server-status-variables.md#statvar_Connection_errors_internal)

    The number of connections refused due to internal errors
    in the server, such as failure to start a new thread or an
    out-of-memory condition.
  - [`Connection_errors_max_connections`](server-status-variables.md#statvar_Connection_errors_max_connections)

    The number of connections refused because the server
    [`max_connections`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_max_connections) limit was
    reached.
  - [`Connection_errors_peer_address`](server-status-variables.md#statvar_Connection_errors_peer_address)

    The number of errors that occurred while searching for
    connecting client IP addresses.
  - [`Connection_errors_select`](server-status-variables.md#statvar_Connection_errors_select)

    The number of errors that occurred during calls to
    `select()` or `poll()`
    on the listening port. (Failure of this operation does not
    necessarily means a client connection was rejected.)
  - [`Connection_errors_tcpwrap`](server-status-variables.md#statvar_Connection_errors_tcpwrap)

    The number of connections refused by the
    `libwrap` library.
- [`Connections`](server-status-variables.md#statvar_Connections)

  The number of connection attempts (successful or not) to the
  MySQL server.
- [`Created_tmp_disk_tables`](server-status-variables.md#statvar_Created_tmp_disk_tables)

  The number of internal on-disk temporary tables created by the
  server while executing statements.

  You can compare the number of internal on-disk temporary
  tables created to the total number of internal temporary
  tables created by comparing
  [`Created_tmp_disk_tables`](server-status-variables.md#statvar_Created_tmp_disk_tables) and
  [`Created_tmp_tables`](server-status-variables.md#statvar_Created_tmp_tables) values.

  Note

  Due to a known limitation,
  [`Created_tmp_disk_tables`](server-status-variables.md#statvar_Created_tmp_disk_tables)
  does not count on-disk temporary tables created in
  memory-mapped files. By default, the TempTable storage
  engine overflow mechanism creates internal temporary tables
  in memory-mapped files. This behavior is controlled by the
  [`temptable_use_mmap`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_temptable_use_mmap)
  variable, which is enabled by default.

  See also [Section 10.4.4, “Internal Temporary Table Use in MySQL”](internal-temporary-tables.md "10.4.4 Internal Temporary Table Use in MySQL").
- [`Created_tmp_files`](server-status-variables.md#statvar_Created_tmp_files)

  How many temporary files [**mysqld**](mysqld.md "6.3.1 mysqld — The MySQL Server") has
  created.
- [`Created_tmp_tables`](server-status-variables.md#statvar_Created_tmp_tables)

  The number of internal temporary tables created by the server
  while executing statements.

  You can compare the number of internal on-disk temporary
  tables created to the total number of internal temporary
  tables created by comparing
  [`Created_tmp_disk_tables`](server-status-variables.md#statvar_Created_tmp_disk_tables) and
  [`Created_tmp_tables`](server-status-variables.md#statvar_Created_tmp_tables) values.

  See also [Section 10.4.4, “Internal Temporary Table Use in MySQL”](internal-temporary-tables.md "10.4.4 Internal Temporary Table Use in MySQL").

  Each invocation of the [`SHOW
  STATUS`](show-status.md "15.7.7.37 SHOW STATUS Statement") statement uses an internal temporary table
  and increments the global
  [`Created_tmp_tables`](server-status-variables.md#statvar_Created_tmp_tables) value.
- [`Current_tls_ca`](server-status-variables.md#statvar_Current_tls_ca)

  The active [`ssl_ca`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_ssl_ca) value in
  the SSL context that the server uses for new connections. This
  context value may differ from the current
  [`ssl_ca`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_ssl_ca) system variable value
  if the system variable has been changed but
  [`ALTER INSTANCE RELOAD TLS`](alter-instance.md#alter-instance-reload-tls) has
  not subsequently been executed to reconfigure the SSL context
  from the context-related system variable values and update the
  corresponding status variables. (This potential difference in
  values applies to each corresponding pair of context-related
  system and status variables. See
  [Server-Side Runtime Configuration and Monitoring for Encrypted
  Connections](using-encrypted-connections.md#using-encrypted-connections-server-side-runtime-configuration "Server-Side Runtime Configuration and Monitoring for Encrypted Connections").)

  This variable was added in MySQL 8.0.16.

  As of MySQL 8.0.21, the
  `Current_tls_xxx`
  status variable values are also available through the
  Performance Schema
  [`tls_channel_status`](performance-schema-tls-channel-status-table.md "29.12.21.9 The tls_channel_status Table") table. See
  [Section 29.12.21.9, “The tls\_channel\_status Table”](performance-schema-tls-channel-status-table.md "29.12.21.9 The tls_channel_status Table").
- [`Current_tls_capath`](server-status-variables.md#statvar_Current_tls_capath)

  The active [`ssl_capath`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_ssl_capath) value
  in the TLS context that the server uses for new connections.
  For notes about the relationship between this status variable
  and its corresponding system variable, see the description of
  [`Current_tls_ca`](server-status-variables.md#statvar_Current_tls_ca).

  This variable was added in MySQL 8.0.16.
- [`Current_tls_cert`](server-status-variables.md#statvar_Current_tls_cert)

  The active [`ssl_cert`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_ssl_cert) value in
  the TLS context that the server uses for new connections. For
  notes about the relationship between this status variable and
  its corresponding system variable, see the description of
  [`Current_tls_ca`](server-status-variables.md#statvar_Current_tls_ca).

  This variable was added in MySQL 8.0.16.
- [`Current_tls_cipher`](server-status-variables.md#statvar_Current_tls_cipher)

  The active [`ssl_cipher`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_ssl_cipher) value
  in the TLS context that the server uses for new connections.
  For notes about the relationship between this status variable
  and its corresponding system variable, see the description of
  [`Current_tls_ca`](server-status-variables.md#statvar_Current_tls_ca).

  This variable was added in MySQL 8.0.16.
- [`Current_tls_ciphersuites`](server-status-variables.md#statvar_Current_tls_ciphersuites)

  The active [`tls_ciphersuites`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_tls_ciphersuites)
  value in the TLS context that the server uses for new
  connections. For notes about the relationship between this
  status variable and its corresponding system variable, see the
  description of
  [`Current_tls_ca`](server-status-variables.md#statvar_Current_tls_ca).

  This variable was added in MySQL 8.0.16.
- [`Current_tls_crl`](server-status-variables.md#statvar_Current_tls_crl)

  The active [`ssl_crl`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_ssl_crl) value in
  the TLS context that the server uses for new connections. For
  notes about the relationship between this status variable and
  its corresponding system variable, see the description of
  [`Current_tls_ca`](server-status-variables.md#statvar_Current_tls_ca).

  This variable was added in MySQL 8.0.16.

  Note

  When you reload the TLS context, OpenSSL reloads the file
  containing the CRL (certificate revocation list) as part of
  the process. If the CRL file is large, the server allocates
  a large chunk of memory (ten times the file size), which is
  doubled while the new instance is being loaded and the old
  one has not yet been released. The process resident memory
  is not immediately reduced after a large allocation is
  freed, so if you issue the `ALTER INSTANCE RELOAD
  TLS` statement repeatedly with a large CRL file,
  the process resident memory usage may grow as a result of
  this.
- [`Current_tls_crlpath`](server-status-variables.md#statvar_Current_tls_crlpath)

  The active [`ssl_crlpath`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_ssl_crlpath) value
  in the TLS context that the server uses for new connections.
  For notes about the relationship between this status variable
  and its corresponding system variable, see the description of
  [`Current_tls_ca`](server-status-variables.md#statvar_Current_tls_ca).

  This variable was added in MySQL 8.0.16.
- [`Current_tls_key`](server-status-variables.md#statvar_Current_tls_key)

  The active [`ssl_key`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_ssl_key) value in
  the TLS context that the server uses for new connections. For
  notes about the relationship between this status variable and
  its corresponding system variable, see the description of
  [`Current_tls_ca`](server-status-variables.md#statvar_Current_tls_ca).

  This variable was added in MySQL 8.0.16.
- [`Current_tls_version`](server-status-variables.md#statvar_Current_tls_version)

  The active [`tls_version`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_tls_version) value
  in the TLS context that the server uses for new connections.
  For notes about the relationship between this status variable
  and its corresponding system variable, see the description of
  [`Current_tls_ca`](server-status-variables.md#statvar_Current_tls_ca).

  This variable was added in MySQL 8.0.16.
- [`Delayed_errors`](server-status-variables.md#statvar_Delayed_errors)

  This status variable is deprecated (because
  `DELAYED` inserts are not supported); expect
  it to be removed in a future release.
- [`Delayed_insert_threads`](server-status-variables.md#statvar_Delayed_insert_threads)

  This status variable is deprecated (because
  `DELAYED` inserts are not supported); expect
  it to be removed in a future release.
- [`Delayed_writes`](server-status-variables.md#statvar_Delayed_writes)

  This status variable is deprecated (because
  `DELAYED` inserts are not supported); expect
  it to be removed in a future release.
- [`dragnet.Status`](server-status-variables.md#statvar_dragnet.Status)

  The result of the most recent assignment to the
  [`dragnet.log_error_filter_rules`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_dragnet.log_error_filter_rules)
  system variable, empty if no such assignment has occurred.

  This variable was added in MySQL 8.0.12.
- [`Error_log_buffered_bytes`](server-status-variables.md#statvar_Error_log_buffered_bytes)

  The number of bytes currently used in the Performance Schema
  [`error_log`](performance-schema-error-log-table.md "29.12.21.2 The error_log Table") table. It is possible
  for the value to decrease, for example, if a new event cannot
  fit until discarding an old event, but the new event is
  smaller than the old one.

  This variable was added in MySQL 8.0.22.
- [`Error_log_buffered_events`](server-status-variables.md#statvar_Error_log_buffered_events)

  The number of events currently present in the Performance
  Schema [`error_log`](performance-schema-error-log-table.md "29.12.21.2 The error_log Table") table. As with
  [`Error_log_buffered_bytes`](server-status-variables.md#statvar_Error_log_buffered_bytes), it
  is possible for the value to decrease.

  This variable was added in MySQL 8.0.22.
- [`Error_log_expired_events`](server-status-variables.md#statvar_Error_log_expired_events)

  The number of events discarded from the Performance Schema
  [`error_log`](performance-schema-error-log-table.md "29.12.21.2 The error_log Table") table to make room for
  new events.

  This variable was added in MySQL 8.0.22.
- [`Error_log_latest_write`](server-status-variables.md#statvar_Error_log_latest_write)

  The time of the last write to the Performance Schema
  [`error_log`](performance-schema-error-log-table.md "29.12.21.2 The error_log Table") table.

  This variable was added in MySQL 8.0.22.
- [`Flush_commands`](server-status-variables.md#statvar_Flush_commands)

  The number of times the server flushes tables, whether because
  a user executed a [`FLUSH TABLES`](flush.md#flush-tables)
  statement or due to internal server operation. It is also
  incremented by receipt of a `COM_REFRESH`
  packet. This is in contrast to
  [`Com_flush`](server-status-variables.md#statvar_Com_xxx),
  which indicates how many `FLUSH` statements
  have been executed, whether [`FLUSH
  TABLES`](flush.md#flush-tables), [`FLUSH LOGS`](flush.md#flush-logs),
  and so forth.
- [`Global_connection_memory`](server-status-variables.md#statvar_Global_connection_memory)

  The memory used by all user connections to the server. Memory
  used by system threads or by the MySQL root account is
  included in the total, but such threads or users are not
  subject to disconnection due to memory usage. This memory is
  not calculated unless
  [`global_connection_memory_tracking`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_global_connection_memory_tracking)
  is enabled (disabled by default). The Performance Schema must
  also be enabled.

  You can control (indirectly) the frequency with which this
  variable is updated by setting
  [`connection_memory_chunk_size`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_connection_memory_chunk_size).

  The `Global_connection_memory` status
  variable was introduced in MySQL 8.0.28.
- [`Handler_commit`](server-status-variables.md#statvar_Handler_commit)

  The number of internal [`COMMIT`](commit.md "15.3.1 START TRANSACTION, COMMIT, and ROLLBACK Statements")
  statements.
- [`Handler_delete`](server-status-variables.md#statvar_Handler_delete)

  The number of times that rows have been deleted from tables.
- [`Handler_external_lock`](server-status-variables.md#statvar_Handler_external_lock)

  The server increments this variable for each call to its
  `external_lock()` function, which generally
  occurs at the beginning and end of access to a table instance.
  There might be differences among storage engines. This
  variable can be used, for example, to discover for a statement
  that accesses a partitioned table how many partitions were
  pruned before locking occurred: Check how much the counter
  increased for the statement, subtract 2 (2 calls for the table
  itself), then divide by 2 to get the number of partitions
  locked.
- [`Handler_mrr_init`](server-status-variables.md#statvar_Handler_mrr_init)

  The number of times the server uses a storage engine's own
  Multi-Range Read implementation for table access.
- [`Handler_prepare`](server-status-variables.md#statvar_Handler_prepare)

  A counter for the prepare phase of two-phase commit
  operations.
- [`Handler_read_first`](server-status-variables.md#statvar_Handler_read_first)

  The number of times the first entry in an index was read. If
  this value is high, it suggests that the server is doing a lot
  of full index scans (for example, `SELECT col1 FROM
  foo`, assuming that `col1` is
  indexed).
- [`Handler_read_key`](server-status-variables.md#statvar_Handler_read_key)

  The number of requests to read a row based on a key. If this
  value is high, it is a good indication that your tables are
  properly indexed for your queries.
- [`Handler_read_last`](server-status-variables.md#statvar_Handler_read_last)

  The number of requests to read the last key in an index. With
  `ORDER BY`, the server issues a first-key
  request followed by several next-key requests, whereas with
  `ORDER BY DESC`, the server issues a last-key
  request followed by several previous-key requests.
- [`Handler_read_next`](server-status-variables.md#statvar_Handler_read_next)

  The number of requests to read the next row in key order. This
  value is incremented if you are querying an index column with
  a range constraint or if you are doing an index scan.
- [`Handler_read_prev`](server-status-variables.md#statvar_Handler_read_prev)

  The number of requests to read the previous row in key order.
  This read method is mainly used to optimize `ORDER BY
  ... DESC`.
- [`Handler_read_rnd`](server-status-variables.md#statvar_Handler_read_rnd)

  The number of requests to read a row based on a fixed
  position. This value is high if you are doing a lot of queries
  that require sorting of the result. You probably have a lot of
  queries that require MySQL to scan entire tables or you have
  joins that do not use keys properly.
- [`Handler_read_rnd_next`](server-status-variables.md#statvar_Handler_read_rnd_next)

  The number of requests to read the next row in the data file.
  This value is high if you are doing a lot of table scans.
  Generally this suggests that your tables are not properly
  indexed or that your queries are not written to take advantage
  of the indexes you have.
- [`Handler_rollback`](server-status-variables.md#statvar_Handler_rollback)

  The number of requests for a storage engine to perform a
  rollback operation.
- [`Handler_savepoint`](server-status-variables.md#statvar_Handler_savepoint)

  savepoint.
- [`Handler_savepoint_rollback`](server-status-variables.md#statvar_Handler_savepoint_rollback)

  The number of requests for a storage engine to roll back to a
  savepoint.
- [`Handler_update`](server-status-variables.md#statvar_Handler_update)

  You can use this status variable in conjunction with
  [`Innodb_buffer_pool_resize_status_progress`](server-status-variables.md#statvar_Innodb_buffer_pool_resize_status_progress)
  to track the progress of each stage of a resizing operation.
  The
  [`Innodb_buffer_pool_resize_status_progress`](server-status-variables.md#statvar_Innodb_buffer_pool_resize_status_progress)
  variable reports a percentage value indicating the progress of
  the current stage.

  For more information, see
  [Monitoring Online Buffer Pool Resizing Progress](innodb-buffer-pool-resize.md#innodb-buffer-pool-online-resize-monitoring "Monitoring Online Buffer Pool Resizing Progress").
- [`Innodb_buffer_pool_resize_status_progress`](server-status-variables.md#statvar_Innodb_buffer_pool_resize_status_progress)

  Reports a percentage value indicating the progress of the
  current stage of an online buffer pool resizing operation.
  This variable is used in conjunction with
  [`Innodb_buffer_pool_resize_status_code`](server-status-variables.md#statvar_Innodb_buffer_pool_resize_status_code),
  which reports a status code indicating the current stage of an
  online buffer pool resizing operation.

  The percentage value is updated after each buffer pool
  instance is processed. As the status code (reported by
  [`Innodb_buffer_pool_resize_status_code`](server-status-variables.md#statvar_Innodb_buffer_pool_resize_status_code))
  changes from one status to another, the percentage value is
  reset to 0.

  the background. When `InnoDB` needs to read
  or create a [page](glossary.md#glos_page "page") and no clean
  pages are available, `InnoDB` flushes some
  [dirty pages](glossary.md#glos_dirty_page "dirty page") first and
  waits for that operation to finish. This counter counts
  instances of these waits. If
  [`innodb_buffer_pool_size`](innodb-parameters.md#sysvar_innodb_buffer_pool_size) has
  been set properly, this value should be small.
- [`Innodb_buffer_pool_write_requests`](server-status-variables.md#statvar_Innodb_buffer_pool_write_requests)

  cache that have changed but have not yet been flushed to disk.
- [`Key_blocks_unused`](server-status-variables.md#statvar_Key_blocks_unused)

  The number of unused blocks in the `MyISAM`
  key cache. You can use this value to determine how much of the

  The number of requests to read a key block from the
  `MyISAM` key cache.
- [`Key_reads`](server-status-variables.md#statvar_Key_reads)

  The number of physical reads of a key block from disk into the
  `MyISAM` key cache. If
  [`Key_reads`](server-status-variables.md#statvar_Key_reads) is large, then
  your [`key_buffer_size`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_key_buffer_size) value is
  probably too small. The cache miss rate can be calculated as
  [`Key_reads`](server-status-variables.md#statvar_Key_reads)/[`Key_read_requests`](server-status-variables.md#statvar_Key_read_requests).
- [`Key_write_requests`](server-status-variables.md#statvar_Key_write_requests)

- [`Last_query_cost`](server-status-variables.md#statvar_Last_query_cost)

  The total cost of the last compiled query as computed by the
  query optimizer. This is useful for comparing the cost of
  different query plans for the same query. The default value of
  0 means that no query has been compiled yet. The default value
  is 0. [`Last_query_cost`](server-status-variables.md#statvar_Last_query_cost) has
  session scope.

  In MySQL 8.0.16 and later, this variable shows the cost of
  queries that have multiple query blocks, summing the cost
  estimates of each query block, estimating how many times
  non-cacheable subqueries are executed, and multiplying the
  cost of those query blocks by the number of subquery
  executions. (Bug #92766, Bug #28786951) Prior to MySQL 8.0.16,
  `Last_query_cost` was computed accurately
  only for simple, “flat” queries, but not for
  complex queries such as those containing subqueries or
  [`UNION`](union.md "15.2.18 UNION Clause"). (For the latter, the
  value was set to 0.)
- [`Last_query_partial_plans`](server-status-variables.md#statvar_Last_query_partial_plans)

  plan construction for the previous query.

  `Last_query_partial_plans` has session scope.

  The number of [`SELECT`](select.md "15.2.13 SELECT Statement") statements
  for which a nonzero execution timeout was set. This includes
  statements that include a nonzero
  [`MAX_EXECUTION_TIME`](optimizer-hints.md#optimizer-hints-execution-time "Statement Execution Time Optimizer Hints") optimizer
  hint, and statements that include no such hint but execute
  while the timeout indicated by the
  [`max_execution_time`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_max_execution_time) system
  variable is nonzero.
- [`Max_execution_time_set_failed`](server-status-variables.md#statvar_Max_execution_time_set_failed)

  The number of [`SELECT`](select.md "15.2.13 SELECT Statement") statements

  it to be removed in a future release.
- [`mecab_charset`](server-status-variables.md#statvar_mecab_charset)

  The character set currently used by the MeCab full-text parser
  plugin. For related information, see

  The number of files that are open. This count includes regular
  files opened by the server. It does not include other types of
  files such as sockets or pipes. Also, the count does not
  include files that storage engines open using their own
  internal functions rather than asking the server level to do
  so.
- [`Open_streams`](server-status-variables.md#statvar_Open_streams)

  The number of streams that are open (used mainly for logging).
- [`Open_table_definitions`](server-status-variables.md#statvar_Open_table_definitions)

  The number of table definitions that have been cached.
- [`Opened_tables`](server-status-variables.md#statvar_Opened_tables)

  [`Opened_tables`](server-status-variables.md#statvar_Opened_tables) is big, your
  [`table_open_cache`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_table_open_cache) value is
  probably too small.
- `Performance_schema_xxx`

  Performance Schema status variables are listed in
  [Section 29.16, “Performance Schema Status Variables”](performance-schema-status-variables.md "29.16 Performance Schema Status Variables"). These
  variables provide information about instrumentation that could
  not be loaded or created due to memory constraints.

  system variable.)
- [`Queries`](server-status-variables.md#statvar_Queries)

  The number of statements executed by the server. This variable
  includes statements executed within stored programs, unlike
  the [`Questions`](server-status-variables.md#statvar_Questions) variable. It
  does not count `COM_PING` or
  `COM_STATISTICS` commands.

  The discussion at the beginning of this section indicates how
  to relate this statement-counting status variable to other
  such variables.
- [`Questions`](server-status-variables.md#statvar_Questions)

  The number of statements executed by the server. This includes
  only statements sent to the server by clients and not
  statements executed within stored programs, unlike the
  [`Queries`](server-status-variables.md#statvar_Queries) variable. This
  variable does not count `COM_PING`,
  `COM_STATISTICS`,
  `COM_STMT_PREPARE`,
  `COM_STMT_CLOSE`, or
  `COM_STMT_RESET` commands.

  The discussion at the beginning of this section indicates how
  to relate this statement-counting status variable to other
  such variables.
- [`Replica_open_temp_tables`](server-status-variables.md#statvar_Replica_open_temp_tables)

  From MySQL 8.0.26, use
  [`Replica_open_temp_tables`](server-status-variables.md#statvar_Replica_open_temp_tables) in

  [`Replica_open_temp_tables`](server-status-variables.md#statvar_Replica_open_temp_tables)
  shows the number of temporary tables that the replication SQL
  thread currently has open. If the value is greater than zero,
  it is not safe to shut down the replica; see

  which is deprecated from that release. In releases before
  MySQL 8.0.26, use
  [`Slave_rows_last_search_algorithm_used`](server-status-variables.md#statvar_Slave_rows_last_search_algorithm_used).

  [`Replica_rows_last_search_algorithm_used`](server-status-variables.md#statvar_Replica_rows_last_search_algorithm_used)
  shows the search algorithm that was most recently used by this
  replica to locate rows for row-based replication. The result
  shows whether the replica used indexes, a table scan, or
  hashing as the search algorithm for the last transaction
  executed on any channel.

  The method used depends on the setting for the
  [`slave_rows_search_algorithms`](replication-options-replica.md#sysvar_slave_rows_search_algorithms)
  system variable (which is now deprecated), and the keys that
  are available on the relevant table.

  This variable is available only for debug builds of MySQL.

  your queries, and then either split your table or tables or
  use replication.
- [`Table_open_cache_hits`](server-status-variables.md#statvar_Table_open_cache_hits)

  The number of hits for open tables cache lookups.
- [`Table_open_cache_misses`](server-status-variables.md#statvar_Table_open_cache_misses)

  The number of misses for open tables cache lookups.
- [`Table_open_cache_overflows`](server-status-variables.md#statvar_Table_open_cache_overflows)

  The number of overflows for the open tables cache. This is the
  number of times, after a table is opened or closed, a cache
  instance has an unused entry and the size of the instance is
  larger than [`table_open_cache`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_table_open_cache)
  / [`table_open_cache_instances`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_table_open_cache_instances).
- [`Tc_log_max_pages_used`](server-status-variables.md#statvar_Tc_log_max_pages_used)

  For the memory-mapped implementation of the log that is used
  by [**mysqld**](mysqld.md "6.3.1 mysqld — The MySQL Server") when it acts as the transaction
  coordinator for recovery of internal XA transactions, this
  variable indicates the largest number of pages used for the
  log since the server started. If the product of
  [`Tc_log_max_pages_used`](server-status-variables.md#statvar_Tc_log_max_pages_used) and
  [`Tc_log_page_size`](server-status-variables.md#statvar_Tc_log_page_size) is always
  significantly less than the log size, the size is larger than
  necessary and can be reduced. (The size is set by the
  [`--log-tc-size`](server-options.md#option_mysqld_log-tc-size) option. This
  variable is unused: It is unneeded for binary log-based
  recovery, and the memory-mapped recovery log method is not
  used unless the number of storage engines that are capable of
  two-phase commit and that support XA transactions is greater
  than one. (`InnoDB` is the only applicable
  engine.)
- [`Tc_log_page_size`](server-status-variables.md#statvar_Tc_log_page_size)

  The page size used for the memory-mapped implementation of the
  XA recovery log. The default value is determined using
  `getpagesize()`. This variable is unused for
  the same reasons as described for
  [`Tc_log_max_pages_used`](server-status-variables.md#statvar_Tc_log_max_pages_used).
- [`Tc_log_page_waits`](server-status-variables.md#statvar_Tc_log_page_waits)

  For the memory-mapped implementation of the recovery log, this
  variable increments each time the server was not able to
  commit a transaction and had to wait for a free page in the
  log. If this value is large, you might want to increase the
  log size (with the
  [`--log-tc-size`](server-options.md#option_mysqld_log-tc-size) option). For
  binary log-based recovery, this variable increments each time
  the binary log cannot be closed because there are two-phase
  commits in progress. (The close operation waits until all such
  transactions are finished.)
- [`Telemetry_traces_supported`](server-status-variables.md#statvar_Telemetry_traces_supported)

  Whether server telemetry traces is supported.

  For more information, see the *Server telemetry
  traces service* section in the MySQL Source Code
  documentation.
- [`Threads_cached`](server-status-variables.md#statvar_Threads_cached)

  The number of threads in the thread cache.
- [`Threads_connected`](server-status-variables.md#statvar_Threads_connected)

  The number of currently open connections.
- [`Threads_created`](server-status-variables.md#statvar_Threads_created)

  The number of threads created to handle connections. If
  [`Threads_created`](server-status-variables.md#statvar_Threads_created) is big, you
  may want to increase the
  [`thread_cache_size`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_thread_cache_size) value. The
  cache miss rate can be calculated as
  [`Threads_created`](server-status-variables.md#statvar_Threads_created)/[`Connections`](server-status-variables.md#statvar_Connections).
- [`Threads_running`](server-status-variables.md#statvar_Threads_running)

  The number of threads that are not sleeping.
- [`Tls_library_version`](server-status-variables.md#statvar_Tls_library_version)

  The runtime version of the OpenSSL library that is in use for
  this MySQL instance.

  This variable was added in MySQL 8.0.30.
- [`Uptime`](server-status-variables.md#statvar_Uptime)

  The number of seconds that the server has been up.
- [`Uptime_since_flush_status`](server-status-variables.md#statvar_Uptime_since_flush_status)

  The number of seconds since the most recent `FLUSH
  STATUS` statement.
