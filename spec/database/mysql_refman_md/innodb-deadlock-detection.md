#### 17.7.5.2 Deadlock Detection

When [deadlock
detection](glossary.md#glos_deadlock_detection "deadlock detection") is enabled (the default),
`InnoDB` automatically detects transaction
[deadlocks](glossary.md#glos_deadlock "deadlock") and rolls back a
transaction or transactions to break the deadlock.
`InnoDB` tries to pick small transactions to
roll back, where the size of a transaction is determined by the
number of rows inserted, updated, or deleted.

`InnoDB` is aware of table locks if
`innodb_table_locks = 1` (the default) and
[`autocommit = 0`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_autocommit), and the MySQL
layer above it knows about row-level locks. Otherwise,
`InnoDB` cannot detect deadlocks where a table
lock set by a MySQL [`LOCK TABLES`](lock-tables.md "15.3.6 LOCK TABLES and UNLOCK TABLES Statements")
statement or a lock set by a storage engine other than
`InnoDB` is involved. Resolve these situations
by setting the value of the
[`innodb_lock_wait_timeout`](innodb-parameters.md#sysvar_innodb_lock_wait_timeout) system
variable.

If the `LATEST DETECTED DEADLOCK` section of
`InnoDB` Monitor output includes a message
stating TOO DEEP OR LONG SEARCH IN THE LOCK TABLE
WAITS-FOR GRAPH, WE WILL ROLL BACK FOLLOWING
TRANSACTION, this indicates that the number of
transactions on the wait-for list has reached a limit of 200. A
wait-for list that exceeds 200 transactions is treated as a
deadlock and the transaction attempting to check the wait-for
list is rolled back. The same error may also occur if the
locking thread must look at more than 1,000,000 locks owned by
transactions on the wait-for list.

For techniques to organize database operations to avoid
deadlocks, see [Section 17.7.5, “Deadlocks in InnoDB”](innodb-deadlocks.md "17.7.5 Deadlocks in InnoDB").

##### Disabling Deadlock Detection

On high concurrency systems, deadlock detection can cause a
slowdown when numerous threads wait for the same lock. At
times, it may be more efficient to disable deadlock detection
and rely on the
[`innodb_lock_wait_timeout`](innodb-parameters.md#sysvar_innodb_lock_wait_timeout)
setting for transaction rollback when a deadlock occurs.
Deadlock detection can be disabled using the
[`innodb_deadlock_detect`](innodb-parameters.md#sysvar_innodb_deadlock_detect)
variable.
