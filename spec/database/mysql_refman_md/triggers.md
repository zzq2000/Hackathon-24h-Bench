## 27.3 Using Triggers

[27.3.1 Trigger Syntax and Examples](trigger-syntax.md)

[27.3.2 Trigger Metadata](trigger-metadata.md)

A trigger is a named database object that is associated with a
table, and that activates when a particular event occurs for the
table. Some uses for triggers are to perform checks of values to be
inserted into a table or to perform calculations on values involved
in an update.

A trigger is defined to activate when a statement inserts, updates,
or deletes rows in the associated table. These row operations are
trigger events. For example, rows can be inserted by
[`INSERT`](insert.md "15.2.7 INSERT Statement") or [`LOAD
DATA`](load-data.md "15.2.9 LOAD DATA Statement") statements, and an insert trigger activates for each
inserted row. A trigger can be set to activate either before or
after the trigger event. For example, you can have a trigger
activate before each row that is inserted into a table or after each
row that is updated.

Important

MySQL triggers activate only for changes made to tables by SQL
statements. This includes changes to base tables that underlie
updatable views. Triggers do not activate for changes to tables
made by APIs that do not transmit SQL statements to the MySQL
Server. This means that triggers are not activated by updates made
using the [`NDB`](mysql-cluster.md "Chapter 25 MySQL NDB Cluster 8.0") API.

Triggers are not activated by changes in
`INFORMATION_SCHEMA` or
`performance_schema` tables. Those tables are
actually views and triggers are not permitted on views.

The following sections describe the syntax for creating and dropping
triggers, show some examples of how to use them, and indicate how to
obtain trigger metadata.
