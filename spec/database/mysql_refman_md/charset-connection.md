## 12.4 Connection Character Sets and Collations

A “connection” is what a client program makes when it
connects to the server, to begin a session within which it
interacts with the server. The client sends SQL statements, such
as queries, over the session connection. The server sends
responses, such as result sets or error messages, over the
connection back to the client.

### Connection Character Set and Collation System Variables

Several character set and collation system variables relate to a
client's interaction with the server. Some of these have been
mentioned in earlier sections:

- The [`character_set_server`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_character_set_server)
  and [`collation_server`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_collation_server) system
  variables indicate the server character set and collation.
  See [Section 12.3.2, “Server Character Set and Collation”](charset-server.md "12.3.2 Server Character Set and Collation").
- The [`character_set_database`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_character_set_database)
  and [`collation_database`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_collation_database)
  system variables indicate the character set and collation of
  the default database. See
  [Section 12.3.3, “Database Character Set and Collation”](charset-database.md "12.3.3 Database Character Set and Collation").

Additional character set and collation system variables are
involved in handling traffic for the connection between a client
and the server. Every client has session-specific
connection-related character set and collation system variables.
These session system variable values are initialized at connect
time, but can be changed within the session.

Several questions about character set and collation handling for
client connections can be answered in terms of system variables:

- What character set are statements in when they leave the
  client?

  The server takes the
  [`character_set_client`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_character_set_client) system
  variable to be the character set in which statements are
  sent by the client.

  Note

  Some character sets cannot be used as the client character
  set. See
  [Impermissible Client Character Sets](charset-connection.md#charset-connection-impermissible-client-charset "Impermissible Client Character Sets").
- What character set should the server translate statements to
  after receiving them?

  To determine this, the server uses the
  [`character_set_connection`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_character_set_connection)
  and [`collation_connection`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_collation_connection)
  system variables:

  - The server converts statements sent by the client from
    [`character_set_client`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_character_set_client) to
    [`character_set_connection`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_character_set_connection).
    Exception: For string literals that have an introducer
    such as `_utf8mb4` or
    `_latin2`, the introducer determines
    the character set. See
    [Section 12.3.8, “Character Set Introducers”](charset-introducer.md "12.3.8 Character Set Introducers").
  - [`collation_connection`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_collation_connection) is
    important for comparisons of literal strings. For
    comparisons of strings with column values,
    [`collation_connection`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_collation_connection)
    does not matter because columns have their own
    collation, which has a higher collation precedence (see
    [Section 12.8.4, “Collation Coercibility in Expressions”](charset-collation-coercibility.md "12.8.4 Collation Coercibility in Expressions")).
- What character set should the server translate query results
  to before shipping them back to the client?

  The [`character_set_results`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_character_set_results)
  system variable indicates the character set in which the
  server returns query results to the client. This includes
  result data such as column values, result metadata such as
  column names, and error messages.

  To tell the server to perform no conversion of result sets
  or error messages, set
  [`character_set_results`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_character_set_results) to
  `NULL` or `binary`:

  ```sql
  SET character_set_results = NULL;
  SET character_set_results = binary;
  ```

  For more information about character sets and error
  messages, see [Section 12.6, “Error Message Character Set”](charset-errors.md "12.6 Error Message Character Set").

To see the values of the character set and collation system
variables that apply to the current session, use this statement:

```sql
SELECT * FROM performance_schema.session_variables
WHERE VARIABLE_NAME IN (
  'character_set_client', 'character_set_connection',
  'character_set_results', 'collation_connection'
) ORDER BY VARIABLE_NAME;
```

The following simpler statements also display the connection
variables, but include other related variables as well. They can
be useful to see *all* character set and
collation system variables:

```sql
SHOW SESSION VARIABLES LIKE 'character\_set\_%';
SHOW SESSION VARIABLES LIKE 'collation\_%';
```

Clients can fine-tune the settings for these variables, or
depend on the defaults (in which case, you can skip the rest of
this section). If you do not use the defaults, you must change
the character settings *for each connection to the
server*.

### Impermissible Client Character Sets

The [`character_set_client`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_character_set_client) system
variable cannot be set to certain character sets:

```simple
ucs2
utf16
utf16le
utf32
```

Attempting to use any of those character sets as the client
character set produces an error:

```sql
mysql> SET character_set_client = 'ucs2';
ERROR 1231 (42000): Variable 'character_set_client'
can't be set to the value of 'ucs2'
```

The same error occurs if any of those character sets are used in
the following contexts, all of which result in an attempt to set
[`character_set_client`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_character_set_client) to the
named character set:

- The
  [`--default-character-set=charset_name`](mysql-command-options.md#option_mysql_default-character-set)
  command option used by MySQL client programs such as
  [**mysql**](mysql.md "6.5.1 mysql — The MySQL Command-Line Client") and [**mysqladmin**](mysqladmin.md "6.5.2 mysqladmin — A MySQL Server Administration Program").
- The [`SET NAMES
  'charset_name'`](set-names.md "15.7.6.3 SET NAMES Statement")
  statement.
- The [`SET
  CHARACTER SET
  'charset_name'`](set-character-set.md "15.7.6.2 SET CHARACTER SET Statement")
  statement.

### Client Program Connection Character Set Configuration

When a client connects to the server, it indicates which
character set it wants to use for communication with the server.
(Actually, the client indicates the default collation for that
character set, from which the server can determine the character
set.) The server uses this information to set the
[`character_set_client`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_character_set_client),
[`character_set_results`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_character_set_results),
[`character_set_connection`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_character_set_connection) system
variables to the character set, and
[`collation_connection`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_collation_connection) to the
character set default collation. In effect, the server performs
the equivalent of a [`SET NAMES`](set-names.md "15.7.6.3 SET NAMES Statement")
operation.

If the server does not support the requested character set or
collation, it falls back to using the server character set and
collation to configure the connection. For additional detail
about this fallback behavior, see
[Connection Character Set Error Handling](charset-connection.md#charset-connection-error-handling "Connection Character Set Error Handling").

The [**mysql**](mysql.md "6.5.1 mysql — The MySQL Command-Line Client"), [**mysqladmin**](mysqladmin.md "6.5.2 mysqladmin — A MySQL Server Administration Program"),
[**mysqlcheck**](mysqlcheck.md "6.5.3 mysqlcheck — A Table Maintenance Program"), [**mysqlimport**](mysqlimport.md "6.5.5 mysqlimport — A Data Import Program"),
and [**mysqlshow**](mysqlshow.md "6.5.7 mysqlshow — Display Database, Table, and Column Information") client programs determine the
default character set to use as follows:

- In the absence of other information, each client uses the
  compiled-in default character set, usually
  `utf8mb4`.
- Each client can autodetect which character set to use based
  on the operating system setting, such as the value of the
  `LANG` or `LC_ALL` locale
  environment variable on Unix systems or the code page
  setting on Windows systems. For systems on which the locale
  is available from the OS, the client uses it to set the
  default character set rather than using the compiled-in
  default. For example, setting `LANG` to
  `ru_RU.KOI8-R` causes the
  `koi8r` character set to be used. Thus,
  users can configure the locale in their environment for use
  by MySQL clients.

  The OS character set is mapped to the closest MySQL
  character set if there is no exact match. If the client does
  not support the matching character set, it uses the
  compiled-in default. For example, `utf8`
  and `utf-8` map to
  `utf8mb4`, and `ucs2` is
  not supported as a connection character set, so it maps to
  the compiled-in default.

  C applications can use character set autodetection based on
  the OS setting by invoking
  [`mysql_options()`](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/c-api/8.0/en/mysql-options.html) as follows
  before connecting to the server:

  ```c
  mysql_options(mysql,
                MYSQL_SET_CHARSET_NAME,
                MYSQL_AUTODETECT_CHARSET_NAME);
  ```
- Each client supports a
  [`--default-character-set`](mysql-command-options.md#option_mysql_default-character-set)
  option, which enables users to specify the character set
  explicitly to override whatever default the client otherwise
  determines.

  Note

  Some character sets cannot be used as the client character
  set. Attempting to use them with
  [`--default-character-set`](mysql-command-options.md#option_mysql_default-character-set)
  produces an error. See
  [Impermissible Client Character Sets](charset-connection.md#charset-connection-impermissible-client-charset "Impermissible Client Character Sets").

With the [**mysql**](mysql.md "6.5.1 mysql — The MySQL Command-Line Client") client, to use a character set
different from the default, you could explicitly execute a
[`SET NAMES`](set-names.md "15.7.6.3 SET NAMES Statement") statement every time
you connect to the server (see
[Client Program Connection Character Set Configuration](charset-connection.md#charset-connection-client-configuration "Client Program Connection Character Set Configuration")). To
accomplish the same result more easily, specify the character
set in your option file. For example, the following option file
setting changes the three connection-related character set
system variables set to `koi8r` each time you
invoke [**mysql**](mysql.md "6.5.1 mysql — The MySQL Command-Line Client"):

```ini
[mysql]
default-character-set=koi8r
```

If you are using the [**mysql**](mysql.md "6.5.1 mysql — The MySQL Command-Line Client") client with
auto-reconnect enabled (which is not recommended), it is
preferable to use the `charset` command rather
than [`SET NAMES`](set-names.md "15.7.6.3 SET NAMES Statement"). For example:

```sql
mysql> charset koi8r
Charset changed
```

The `charset` command issues a
[`SET NAMES`](set-names.md "15.7.6.3 SET NAMES Statement") statement, and also
changes the default character set that [**mysql**](mysql.md "6.5.1 mysql — The MySQL Command-Line Client")
uses when it reconnects after the connection has dropped.

When configuration client programs, you must also consider the
environment within which they execute. See
[Section 12.5, “Configuring Application Character Set and Collation”](charset-applications.md "12.5 Configuring Application Character Set and Collation").

### SQL Statements for Connection Character Set Configuration

After a connection has been established, clients can change the
character set and collation system variables for the current
session. These variables can be changed individually using
[`SET`](set-statement.md "15.7.6 SET Statements")
statements, but two more convenient statements affect the
connection-related character set system variables as a group:

- `SET NAMES 'charset_name'
  [COLLATE
  'collation_name']`

  [`SET NAMES`](set-names.md "15.7.6.3 SET NAMES Statement") indicates what
  character set the client uses to send SQL statements to the
  server. Thus, [`SET
  NAMES 'cp1251'`](set-names.md "15.7.6.3 SET NAMES Statement") tells the server, “future
  incoming messages from this client are in character set
  `cp1251`.” It also specifies the
  character set that the server should use for sending results
  back to the client. (For example, it indicates what
  character set to use for column values if you use a
  [`SELECT`](select.md "15.2.13 SELECT Statement") statement that
  produces a result set.)

  A [`SET NAMES
  'charset_name'`](set-names.md "15.7.6.3 SET NAMES Statement")
  statement is equivalent to these three statements:

  ```sql
  SET character_set_client = charset_name;
  SET character_set_results = charset_name;
  SET character_set_connection = charset_name;
  ```

  Setting
  [`character_set_connection`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_character_set_connection) to
  *`charset_name`* also implicitly sets
  [`collation_connection`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_collation_connection) to the
  default collation for
  *`charset_name`*. It is unnecessary
  to set that collation explicitly. To specify a particular
  collation to use for
  [`collation_connection`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_collation_connection), add a
  `COLLATE` clause:

  ```sql
  SET NAMES 'charset_name' COLLATE 'collation_name'
  ```
- `SET CHARACTER SET
  'charset_name`'

  [`SET CHARACTER SET`](set-character-set.md "15.7.6.2 SET CHARACTER SET Statement") is similar
  to [`SET NAMES`](set-names.md "15.7.6.3 SET NAMES Statement") but sets
  [`character_set_connection`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_character_set_connection)
  and [`collation_connection`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_collation_connection) to
  [`character_set_database`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_character_set_database) and
  [`collation_database`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_collation_database) (which,
  as mentioned previously, indicate the character set and
  collation of the default database).

  A [`SET
  CHARACTER SET
  charset_name`](set-character-set.md "15.7.6.2 SET CHARACTER SET Statement") statement
  is equivalent to these three statements:

  ```sql
  SET character_set_client = charset_name;
  SET character_set_results = charset_name;
  SET collation_connection = @@collation_database;
  ```

  Setting
  [`collation_connection`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_collation_connection) also
  implicitly sets
  [`character_set_connection`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_character_set_connection) to
  the character set associated with the collation (equivalent
  to executing `SET character_set_connection =
  @@character_set_database`). It is unnecessary to
  set
  [`character_set_connection`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_character_set_connection)
  explicitly.

Note

Some character sets cannot be used as the client character
set. Attempting to use them with [`SET
NAMES`](set-names.md "15.7.6.3 SET NAMES Statement") or [`SET CHARACTER
SET`](set-character-set.md "15.7.6.2 SET CHARACTER SET Statement") produces an error. See
[Impermissible Client Character Sets](charset-connection.md#charset-connection-impermissible-client-charset "Impermissible Client Character Sets").

Example: Suppose that `column1` is defined as
`CHAR(5) CHARACTER SET latin2`. If you do not
say [`SET NAMES`](set-names.md "15.7.6.3 SET NAMES Statement") or
[`SET CHARACTER SET`](set-character-set.md "15.7.6.2 SET CHARACTER SET Statement"), then for
`SELECT column1 FROM t`, the server sends back
all the values for `column1` using the
character set that the client specified when it connected. On
the other hand, if you say `SET NAMES 'latin1'`
or `SET CHARACTER SET 'latin1'` before issuing
the [`SELECT`](select.md "15.2.13 SELECT Statement") statement, the server
converts the `latin2` values to
`latin1` just before sending results back.
Conversion may be lossy for characters that are not in both
character sets.

### Connection Character Set Error Handling

Attempts to use an inappropriate connection character set or
collation can produce an error, or cause the server to fall back
to its default character set and collation for a given
connection. This section describes problems that can occur when
configuring the connection character set. These problems can
occur when establishing a connection or when changing the
character set within an established connection.

- [Connect-Time Error Handling](charset-connection.md#charset-connection-error-handling-connect-time "Connect-Time Error Handling")
- [Runtime Error Handling](charset-connection.md#charset-connection-error-handling-runtime "Runtime Error Handling")

#### Connect-Time Error Handling

Some character sets cannot be used as the client character set;
see
[Impermissible Client Character Sets](charset-connection.md#charset-connection-impermissible-client-charset "Impermissible Client Character Sets").
If you specify a character set that is valid but not permitted
as a client character set, the server returns an error:

```terminal
$> mysql --default-character-set=ucs2
ERROR 1231 (42000): Variable 'character_set_client' can't be set to
the value of 'ucs2'
```

If you specify a character set that the client does not
recognize, it produces an error:

```terminal
$> mysql --default-character-set=bogus
mysql: Character set 'bogus' is not a compiled character set and is
not specified in the '/usr/local/mysql/share/charsets/Index.xml' file
ERROR 2019 (HY000): Can't initialize character set bogus
(path: /usr/local/mysql/share/charsets/)
```

If you specify a character set that the client recognizes but
the server does not, the server falls back to its default
character set and collation. Suppose that the server is
configured to use `latin1` and
`latin1_swedish_ci` as its defaults, and that
it does not recognize `gb18030` as a valid
character set. A client that specifies
[`--default-character-set=gb18030`](mysql-command-options.md#option_mysql_default-character-set) is
able to connect to the server, but the resulting character set
is not what the client wants:

```sql
mysql> SHOW SESSION VARIABLES LIKE 'character\_set\_%';
+--------------------------+--------+
| Variable_name            | Value  |
+--------------------------+--------+
| character_set_client     | latin1 |
| character_set_connection | latin1 |
...
| character_set_results    | latin1 |
...
+--------------------------+--------+
mysql> SHOW SESSION VARIABLES LIKE 'collation_connection';
+----------------------+-------------------+
| Variable_name        | Value             |
+----------------------+-------------------+
| collation_connection | latin1_swedish_ci |
+----------------------+-------------------+
```

You can see that the connection system variables have been set
to reflect a character set and collation of
`latin1` and
`latin1_swedish_ci`. This occurs because the
server cannot satisfy the client character set request and falls
back to its defaults.

In this case, the client cannot use the character set that it
wants because the server does not support it. The client must
either be willing to use a different character set, or connect
to a different server that supports the desired character set.

The same problem occurs in a more subtle context: When the
client tells the server to use a character set that the server
recognizes, but the default collation for that character set on
the client side is not known on the server side. This occurs,
for example, when a MySQL 8.0 client wants to connect to a MySQL
5.7 server using `utf8mb4` as the client
character set. A client that specifies
[`--default-character-set=utf8mb4`](mysql-command-options.md#option_mysql_default-character-set) is
able to connect to the server. However, as in the previous
example, the server falls back to its default character set and
collation, not what the client requested:

```sql
mysql> SHOW SESSION VARIABLES LIKE 'character\_set\_%';
+--------------------------+--------+
| Variable_name            | Value  |
+--------------------------+--------+
| character_set_client     | latin1 |
| character_set_connection | latin1 |
...
| character_set_results    | latin1 |
...
+--------------------------+--------+
mysql> SHOW SESSION VARIABLES LIKE 'collation_connection';
+----------------------+-------------------+
| Variable_name        | Value             |
+----------------------+-------------------+
| collation_connection | latin1_swedish_ci |
+----------------------+-------------------+
```

Why does this occur? After all, `utf8mb4` is
known to the 8.0 client and the 5.7 server, so both of them
recognize it. To understand this behavior, it is necessary to
understand that when the client tells the server which character
set it wants to use, it really tells the server the default
collation for that character set. Therefore, the aforementioned
behavior occurs due to a combination of factors:

- The default collation for `utf8mb4` differs
  between MySQL 5.7 and 8.0
  (`utf8mb4_general_ci` for 5.7,
  `utf8mb4_0900_ai_ci` for 8.0).
- When the 8.0 client requests a character set of
  `utf8mb4`, what it sends to the server is
  the default 8.0 `utf8mb4` collation; that
  is, the `utf8mb4_0900_ai_ci`.
- `utf8mb4_0900_ai_ci` is implemented only as
  of MySQL 8.0, so the 5.7 server does not recognize it.
- Because the 5.7 server does not recognize
  `utf8mb4_0900_ai_ci`, it cannot satisfy the
  client character set request, and falls back to its default
  character set and collation (`latin1` and
  `latin1_swedish_ci`).

In this case, the client can still use
`utf8mb4` by issuing a `SET NAMES
'utf8mb4'` statement after connecting. The resulting
collation is the 5.7 default `utf8mb4`
collation; that is, `utf8mb4_general_ci`. If
the client additionally wants a collation of
`utf8mb4_0900_ai_ci`, it cannot achieve that
because the server does not recognize that collation. The client
must either be willing to use a different
`utf8mb4` collation, or connect to a server
from MySQL 8.0 or higher.

#### Runtime Error Handling

Within an established connection, the client can request a
change of connection character set and collation with
[`SET NAMES`](set-names.md "15.7.6.3 SET NAMES Statement") or
[`SET CHARACTER SET`](set-character-set.md "15.7.6.2 SET CHARACTER SET Statement").

Some character sets cannot be used as the client character set;
see
[Impermissible Client Character Sets](charset-connection.md#charset-connection-impermissible-client-charset "Impermissible Client Character Sets").
If you specify a character set that is valid but not permitted
as a client character set, the server returns an error:

```sql
mysql> SET NAMES 'ucs2';
ERROR 1231 (42000): Variable 'character_set_client' can't be set to
the value of 'ucs2'
```

If the server does not recognize the character set (or the
collation), it produces an error:

```sql
mysql> SET NAMES 'bogus';
ERROR 1115 (42000): Unknown character set: 'bogus'

mysql> SET NAMES 'utf8mb4' COLLATE 'bogus';
ERROR 1273 (HY000): Unknown collation: 'bogus'
```

Tip

A client that wants to verify whether its requested character
set was honored by the server can execute the following
statement after connecting and checking that the result is the
expected character set:

```sql
SELECT @@character_set_client;
```
