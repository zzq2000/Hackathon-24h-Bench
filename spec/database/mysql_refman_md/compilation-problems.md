### 2.8.8 Dealing with Problems Compiling MySQL

The solution to many problems involves reconfiguring. If you do
reconfigure, take note of the following:

- If **CMake** is run after it has previously
  been run, it may use information that was gathered during its
  previous invocation. This information is stored in
  `CMakeCache.txt`. When
  **CMake** starts, it looks for that file and
  reads its contents if it exists, on the assumption that the
  information is still correct. That assumption is invalid when
  you reconfigure.
- Each time you run **CMake**, you must run
  **make** again to recompile. However, you may
  want to remove old object files from previous builds first
  because they were compiled using different configuration
  options.

To prevent old object files or configuration information from
being used, run the following commands before re-running
**CMake**:

On Unix:

```terminal
$> make clean
$> rm CMakeCache.txt
```

On Windows:

```terminal
$> devenv MySQL.sln /clean
$> del CMakeCache.txt
```

If you build outside of the source tree, remove and recreate your
build directory before re-running **CMake**. For
instructions on building outside of the source tree, see
[How to Build MySQL
Server with CMake](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/internals/en/cmake.html).

On some systems, warnings may occur due to differences in system
include files. The following list describes other problems that
have been found to occur most often when compiling MySQL:

- To define which C and C++ compilers to use, you can define the
  `CC` and `CXX` environment
  variables. For example:

  ```terminal
  $> CC=gcc
  $> CXX=g++
  $> export CC CXX
  ```

  While this can be done on the command line, as just shown, you
  may prefer to define these values in a build script, in which
  case the **export** command is not needed.

  To specify your own C and C++ compiler flags, use the
  [`CMAKE_C_FLAGS`](source-configuration-options.md#option_cmake_cmake_c_flags) and
  [`CMAKE_CXX_FLAGS`](source-configuration-options.md#option_cmake_cmake_cxx_flags) CMake options.
  See [Compiler Flags](source-configuration-options.md#cmake-compiler-flags "Compiler Flags").

  To see what flags you might need to specify, invoke
  [**mysql\_config**](mysql-config.md "6.7.1 mysql_config — Display Options for Compiling Clients") with the
  [`--cflags`](mysql-config.md#option_mysql_config_cflags) and
  [`--cxxflags`](mysql-config.md#option_mysql_config_cxxflags) options.
- To see what commands are executed during the compile stage,
  after using **CMake** to configure MySQL, run
  **make VERBOSE=1** rather than just
  **make**.
- If compilation fails, check whether the
  [`MYSQL_MAINTAINER_MODE`](source-configuration-options.md#option_cmake_mysql_maintainer_mode) option is
  enabled. This mode causes compiler warnings to become errors,
  so disabling it may enable compilation to proceed.
- If your compile fails with errors such as any of the
  following, you must upgrade your version of
  **make** to GNU **make**:

  ```simple
  make: Fatal error in reader: Makefile, line 18:
  Badly formed macro assignment
  ```

  Or:

  ```simple
  make: file `Makefile' line 18: Must be a separator (:
  ```

  Or:

  ```simple
  pthread.h: No such file or directory
  ```

  Solaris and FreeBSD are known to have troublesome
  **make** programs.

  GNU **make** 3.75 is known to work.
- The `sql_yacc.cc` file is generated from
  `sql_yacc.yy`. Normally, the build process
  does not need to create `sql_yacc.cc`
  because MySQL comes with a pregenerated copy. However, if you
  do need to re-create it, you might encounter this error:

  ```simple
  "sql_yacc.yy", line xxx fatal: default action causes potential...
  ```

  This is a sign that your version of **yacc** is
  deficient. You probably need to install a recent version of
  **bison** (the GNU version of
  **yacc**) and use that instead.

  Versions of **bison** older than 1.75 may
  report this error:

  ```simple
  sql_yacc.yy:#####: fatal error: maximum table size (32767) exceeded
  ```

  The maximum table size is not actually exceeded; the error is
  caused by bugs in older versions of **bison**.

requirements in [Section 2.8, “Installing MySQL from Source”](source-installation.md "2.8 Installing MySQL from Source").
