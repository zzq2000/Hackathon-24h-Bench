#### 17.6.3.4 Undo Tablespaces

Undo tablespaces contain undo logs, which are collections of
records containing information about how to undo the latest change
by a transaction to a clustered index record.

Undo tablespaces are described under the following topics in this
section:

- [Default Undo Tablespaces](innodb-undo-tablespaces.md#innodb-default-undo-tablespaces "Default Undo Tablespaces")
- [Undo Tablespace Size](innodb-undo-tablespaces.md#innodb--undo-tablespace-size "Undo Tablespace Size")
- [Adding Undo Tablespaces](innodb-undo-tablespaces.md#innodb-add-undo-tablespaces "Adding Undo Tablespaces")
- [Dropping Undo Tablespaces](innodb-undo-tablespaces.md#innodb-drop-undo-tablespaces "Dropping Undo Tablespaces")
- [Moving Undo Tablespaces](innodb-undo-tablespaces.md#innodb-move-undo-tablespaces "Moving Undo Tablespaces")
- [Configuring the Number of Rollback Segments](innodb-undo-tablespaces.md#innodb-undo-tablespace-rollback-segments "Configuring the Number of Rollback Segments")
- [Truncating Undo Tablespaces](innodb-undo-tablespaces.md#truncate-undo-tablespace "Truncating Undo Tablespaces")
- [Undo Tablespace Status Variables](innodb-undo-tablespaces.md#innodb-undo-tablespace-status-variables "Undo Tablespace Status Variables")

##### Default Undo Tablespaces

Two default undo tablespaces are created when the MySQL instance
is initialized. Default undo tablespaces are created at
initialization time to provide a location for rollback segments
that must exist before SQL statements can be accepted. A minimum
of two undo tablespaces is required to support automated
truncation of undo tablespaces. See
[Truncating Undo Tablespaces](innodb-undo-tablespaces.md#truncate-undo-tablespace "Truncating Undo Tablespaces").

Default undo tablespaces are created in the location defined by
the [`innodb_undo_directory`](innodb-parameters.md#sysvar_innodb_undo_directory)
variable. If the
[`innodb_undo_directory`](innodb-parameters.md#sysvar_innodb_undo_directory) variable
is undefined, default undo tablespaces are created in the data
directory. Default undo tablespace data files are named
`undo_001` and `undo_002`.
The corresponding undo tablespace names defined in the data
dictionary are `innodb_undo_001` and
`innodb_undo_002`.

As of MySQL 8.0.14, additional undo tablespaces can be created
at runtime using SQL. See
[Adding Undo Tablespaces](innodb-undo-tablespaces.md#innodb-add-undo-tablespaces "Adding Undo Tablespaces").

##### Undo Tablespace Size

Prior to MySQL 8.0.23, the initial size of an undo tablespace
depends on the [`innodb_page_size`](innodb-parameters.md#sysvar_innodb_page_size)
value. For the default 16KB page size, the initial undo
tablespace file size is 10MiB. For 4KB, 8KB, 32KB, and 64KB page
sizes, the initial undo tablespace files sizes are 7MiB, 8MiB,
20MiB, and 40MiB, respectively. As of MySQL 8.0.23, the initial
undo tablespace size is normally 16MiB. The initial size may
differ when a new undo tablespace is created by a truncate
operation. In this case, if the file extension size is larger
than 16MB, and the previous file extension occurred within the
last second, the new undo tablespace is created at a quarter of
the size defined by the
[`innodb_max_undo_log_size`](innodb-parameters.md#sysvar_innodb_max_undo_log_size)
variable.

Prior to MySQL 8.0.23, an undo tablespace is extended four
extents at a time. From MySQL 8.0.23, an undo tablespace is
extended by a minimum of 16MB. To handle aggressive growth, the
file extension size is doubled if the previous file extension
happened less than 0.1 seconds earlier. Doubling of the
extension size can occur multiple times to a maximum of 256MB.
If the previous file extension occurred more than 0.1 seconds
earlier, the extension size is reduced by half, which can also
occur multiple times, to a minimum of 16MB. If the
`AUTOEXTEND_SIZE` option is defined for an undo
tablespace, it is extended by the greater of the
`AUTOEXTEND_SIZE` setting and the extension
size determined by the logic described above. For information
about the `AUTOEXTEND_SIZE` option, see
[Section 17.6.3.9, “Tablespace AUTOEXTEND\_SIZE Configuration”](innodb-tablespace-autoextend-size.md "17.6.3.9 Tablespace AUTOEXTEND_SIZE Configuration").

##### Adding Undo Tablespaces

Because undo logs can become large during long-running
transactions, creating additional undo tablespaces can help
prevent individual undo tablespaces from becoming too large. As
of MySQL 8.0.14, additional undo tablespaces can be created at
runtime using
[`CREATE UNDO
TABLESPACE`](create-tablespace.md "15.1.21 CREATE TABLESPACE Statement") syntax.

```sql
CREATE UNDO TABLESPACE tablespace_name ADD DATAFILE 'file_name.ibu';
```

The undo tablespace file name must have an
`.ibu` extension. It is not permitted to
specify a relative path when defining the undo tablespace file
name. A fully qualified path is permitted, but the path must be
known to `InnoDB`. Known paths are those
defined by the
[`innodb_directories`](innodb-parameters.md#sysvar_innodb_directories) variable.
Unique undo tablespace file names are recommended to avoid
potential file name conflicts when moving or cloning data.

Note

In a replication environment, the source and each replica must
have its own undo tablespace file directory. Replicating the
creation of an undo tablespace file to a common directory
would cause a file name conflict.

At startup, directories defined by the
[`innodb_directories`](innodb-parameters.md#sysvar_innodb_directories) variable are
scanned for undo tablespace files. (The scan also traverses
subdirectories.) Directories defined by the
[`innodb_data_home_dir`](innodb-parameters.md#sysvar_innodb_data_home_dir),
[`innodb_undo_directory`](innodb-parameters.md#sysvar_innodb_undo_directory), and
[`datadir`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_datadir) variables are
automatically appended to the
[`innodb_directories`](innodb-parameters.md#sysvar_innodb_directories) value
regardless of whether the
[`innodb_directories`](innodb-parameters.md#sysvar_innodb_directories) variable is
defined explicitly. An undo tablespace can therefore reside in
paths defined by any of those variables.

If the undo tablespace file name does not include a path, the
undo tablespace is created in the directory defined by the
[`innodb_undo_directory`](innodb-parameters.md#sysvar_innodb_undo_directory) variable.
If that variable is undefined, the undo tablespace is created in
the data directory.

Note

The `InnoDB` recovery process requires that
undo tablespace files reside in known directories. Undo
tablespace files must be discovered and opened before redo
recovery and before other data files are opened to permit
uncommitted transactions and data dictionary changes to be
rolled back. An undo tablespace not found before recovery
cannot be used, which can lead to database inconsistencies. An
error message is reported at startup if an undo tablespace
known to the data dictionary is not found. The known directory
requirement also supports undo tablespace portability. See
[Moving Undo Tablespaces](innodb-undo-tablespaces.md#innodb-move-undo-tablespaces "Moving Undo Tablespaces").

To create undo tablespaces in a path relative to the data
directory, set the
[`innodb_undo_directory`](innodb-parameters.md#sysvar_innodb_undo_directory) variable
to the relative path, and specify the file name only when
creating an undo tablespace.

To view undo tablespace names and paths, query
[`INFORMATION_SCHEMA.FILES`](information-schema-files-table.md "28.3.15 The INFORMATION_SCHEMA FILES Table"):

```sql
SELECT TABLESPACE_NAME, FILE_NAME FROM INFORMATION_SCHEMA.FILES
  WHERE FILE_TYPE LIKE 'UNDO LOG';
```

A MySQL instance supports up to 127 undo tablespaces including
the two default undo tablespaces created when the MySQL instance
is initialized.

Note

Prior to MySQL 8.0.14, additional undo tablespaces are created
by configuring the
[`innodb_undo_tablespaces`](innodb-parameters.md#sysvar_innodb_undo_tablespaces)
startup variable. This variable is deprecated and no longer
configurable as of MySQL 8.0.14.

Prior to MySQL 8.0.14, increasing the
[`innodb_undo_tablespaces`](innodb-parameters.md#sysvar_innodb_undo_tablespaces)
setting creates the specified number of undo tablespaces and
adds them to the list of active undo tablespaces. Decreasing
the [`innodb_undo_tablespaces`](innodb-parameters.md#sysvar_innodb_undo_tablespaces)
setting removes undo tablespaces from the list of active undo
tablespaces. Undo tablespaces that are removed from the active
list remain active until they are no longer used by existing
transactions. The
[`innodb_undo_tablespaces`](innodb-parameters.md#sysvar_innodb_undo_tablespaces)
variable can be configured at runtime using a
[`SET`](set-statement.md "15.7.6 SET Statements")
statement or defined in a configuration file.

Prior to MySQL 8.0.14, deactivated undo tablespaces cannot be
removed. Manual removal of undo tablespace files is possible
after a slow shutdown but is not recommended, as deactivated
undo tablespaces may contain active undo logs for some time
after the server is restarted if open transactions were
present when shutting down the server. As of MySQL 8.0.14,
undo tablespaces can be dropped using
[`DROP UNDO
TABALESPACE`](alter-tablespace.md "15.1.10 ALTER TABLESPACE Statement") syntax. See
[Dropping Undo Tablespaces](innodb-undo-tablespaces.md#innodb-drop-undo-tablespaces "Dropping Undo Tablespaces").

##### Dropping Undo Tablespaces

As of MySQL 8.0.14, undo tablespaces created using
[`CREATE UNDO
TABLESPACE`](create-tablespace.md "15.1.21 CREATE TABLESPACE Statement") syntax can be dropped at runtime using
[`DROP UNDO
TABALESPACE`](alter-tablespace.md "15.1.10 ALTER TABLESPACE Statement") syntax.

An undo tablespace must be empty before it can be dropped. To
empty an undo tablespace, the undo tablespace must first be
marked as inactive using
[`ALTER UNDO
TABLESPACE`](alter-tablespace.md "15.1.10 ALTER TABLESPACE Statement") syntax so that the tablespace is no longer
used for assigning rollback segments to new transactions.

```sql
ALTER UNDO TABLESPACE tablespace_name SET INACTIVE;
```

After an undo tablespace is marked as inactive, transactions
currently using rollback segments in the undo tablespace are
permitted to finish, as are any transactions started before
those transactions are completed. After transactions are
completed, the purge system frees the rollback segments in the
undo tablespace, and the undo tablespace is truncated to its
initial size. (The same process is used when truncating undo
tablespaces. See [Truncating Undo Tablespaces](innodb-undo-tablespaces.md#truncate-undo-tablespace "Truncating Undo Tablespaces").)
Once the undo tablespace is empty, it can be dropped.

```sql
DROP UNDO TABLESPACE tablespace_name;
```

Note

Alternatively, the undo tablespace can be left in an empty
state and reactivated later, if needed, by issuing an
[`ALTER UNDO
TABLESPACE tablespace_name SET
ACTIVE`](alter-tablespace.md "15.1.10 ALTER TABLESPACE Statement") statement.

The state of an undo tablespace can be monitored by querying the
Information Schema
[`INNODB_TABLESPACES`](information-schema-innodb-tablespaces-table.md "28.4.24 The INFORMATION_SCHEMA INNODB_TABLESPACES Table") table.

```sql
SELECT NAME, STATE FROM INFORMATION_SCHEMA.INNODB_TABLESPACES
  WHERE NAME LIKE 'tablespace_name';
```

An `inactive` state indicates that rollback
segments in an undo tablespace are no longer used by new
transactions. An `empty` state indicates that
an undo tablespace is empty and ready to be dropped, or ready to
be made active again using an
[`ALTER UNDO
TABLESPACE tablespace_name SET
ACTIVE`](alter-tablespace.md "15.1.10 ALTER TABLESPACE Statement") statement. Attempting to drop an undo
tablespace that is not empty returns an error.

The default undo tablespaces (`innodb_undo_001`
and `innodb_undo_002`) created when the MySQL
instance is initialized cannot be dropped. They can, however, be
made inactive using an
[`ALTER UNDO
TABLESPACE tablespace_name SET
INACTIVE`](alter-tablespace.md "15.1.10 ALTER TABLESPACE Statement") statement. Before a default undo tablespace
can be made inactive, there must be an undo tablespace to take
its place. A minimum of two active undo tablespaces are required
at all times to support automated truncation of undo
tablespaces.

##### Moving Undo Tablespaces

Undo tablespaces created with
[`CREATE UNDO
TABLESPACE`](create-tablespace.md "15.1.21 CREATE TABLESPACE Statement") syntax can be moved while the server is
offline to any known directory. Known directories are those
defined by the
[`innodb_directories`](innodb-parameters.md#sysvar_innodb_directories) variable.
Directories defined by
[`innodb_data_home_dir`](innodb-parameters.md#sysvar_innodb_data_home_dir),
[`innodb_undo_directory`](innodb-parameters.md#sysvar_innodb_undo_directory), and
[`datadir`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_datadir) are automatically
appended to the
[`innodb_directories`](innodb-parameters.md#sysvar_innodb_directories) value
regardless of whether the
[`innodb_directories`](innodb-parameters.md#sysvar_innodb_directories) variable is
defined explicitly. Those directories and their subdirectories
are scanned at startup for undo tablespaces files. An undo
tablespace file moved to any of those directories is discovered
at startup and assumed to be the undo tablespace that was moved.

The default undo tablespaces (`innodb_undo_001`
and `innodb_undo_002`) created when the MySQL
instance is initialized must reside in the directory defined by
the [`innodb_undo_directory`](innodb-parameters.md#sysvar_innodb_undo_directory)
variable. If the
[`innodb_undo_directory`](innodb-parameters.md#sysvar_innodb_undo_directory) variable
is undefined, default undo tablespaces reside in the data
directory. If default undo tablespaces are moved while the
server is offline, the server must be started with the
[`innodb_undo_directory`](innodb-parameters.md#sysvar_innodb_undo_directory) variable
configured to the new directory.

The I/O patterns for undo logs make undo tablespaces good
candidates for [SSD](glossary.md#glos_ssd "SSD") storage.

##### Configuring the Number of Rollback Segments

The [`innodb_rollback_segments`](innodb-parameters.md#sysvar_innodb_rollback_segments)
variable defines the number of
[rollback segments](glossary.md#glos_rollback_segment "rollback segment")
allocated to each undo tablespace and to the global temporary
tablespace. The
[`innodb_rollback_segments`](innodb-parameters.md#sysvar_innodb_rollback_segments)
variable can be configured at startup or while the server is
running.

The default setting for
[`innodb_rollback_segments`](innodb-parameters.md#sysvar_innodb_rollback_segments) is
128, which is also the maximum value. For information about the
number of transactions that a rollback segment supports, see
[Section 17.6.6, “Undo Logs”](innodb-undo-logs.md "17.6.6 Undo Logs").

##### Truncating Undo Tablespaces

There are two methods of truncating undo tablespaces, which can
be used individually or in combination to manage undo tablespace
size. One method is automated, enabled using configuration
variables. The other method is manual, performed using SQL
statements.

The automated method does not require monitoring undo tablespace
size and, once enabled, it performs deactivation, truncation,
and reactivation of undo tablespaces without manual
intervention. The manual truncation method may be preferable if
you want to control when undo tablespaces are taken offline for
truncation. For example, you may want to avoid truncating undo
tablespaces during peak workload times.

###### Automated Truncation

Automated truncation of undo tablespaces requires a minimum of
two active undo tablespaces, which ensures that one undo
tablespace remains active while the other is taken offline to be
truncated. By default, two undo tablespaces are created when the
MySQL instance is initialized.

To have undo tablespaces automatically truncated, enable the
[`innodb_undo_log_truncate`](innodb-parameters.md#sysvar_innodb_undo_log_truncate)
variable. For example:

```sql
mysql> SET GLOBAL innodb_undo_log_truncate=ON;
```

When the
[`innodb_undo_log_truncate`](innodb-parameters.md#sysvar_innodb_undo_log_truncate)
variable is enabled, undo tablespaces that exceed the size limit
defined by the
[`innodb_max_undo_log_size`](innodb-parameters.md#sysvar_innodb_max_undo_log_size)
variable are subject to truncation. The
[`innodb_max_undo_log_size`](innodb-parameters.md#sysvar_innodb_max_undo_log_size)
variable is dynamic and has a default value of 1073741824 bytes
(1024 MiB).

```sql
mysql> SELECT @@innodb_max_undo_log_size;
+----------------------------+
| @@innodb_max_undo_log_size |
+----------------------------+
|                 1073741824 |
+----------------------------+
```

When the
[`innodb_undo_log_truncate`](innodb-parameters.md#sysvar_innodb_undo_log_truncate)
variable is enabled:

1. Default and user-defined undo tablespaces that exceed the
   [`innodb_max_undo_log_size`](innodb-parameters.md#sysvar_innodb_max_undo_log_size)
   setting are marked for truncation. Selection of an undo
   tablespace for truncation is performed in a circular fashion
   to avoid truncating the same undo tablespace each time.
2. Rollback segments residing in the selected undo tablespace
   are made inactive so that they are not assigned to new
   transactions. Existing transactions that are currently using
   rollback segments are permitted to finish.
3. The [purge](glossary.md#glos_purge "purge") system empties
   rollback segments by freeing undo logs that are no longer in
   use.
4. After all rollback segments in the undo tablespace are
   freed, the truncate operation runs and truncates the undo
   tablespace to 16MB.

   The [`innodb_undo_directory`](innodb-parameters.md#sysvar_innodb_undo_directory)
   variable defines the location of default undo tablespace
   files. If the
   [`innodb_undo_directory`](innodb-parameters.md#sysvar_innodb_undo_directory)
   variable is undefined, default undo tablespaces reside in
   the data directory. The location of all undo tablespace
   files including user-defined undo tablespaces created using
   [`CREATE
   UNDO TABLESPACE`](create-tablespace.md "15.1.21 CREATE TABLESPACE Statement") syntax can be determined by
   querying the Information Schema
   [`FILES`](information-schema-files-table.md "28.3.15 The INFORMATION_SCHEMA FILES Table") table:

   ```sql
   SELECT TABLESPACE_NAME, FILE_NAME FROM INFORMATION_SCHEMA.FILES WHERE FILE_TYPE LIKE 'UNDO LOG';
   ```
5. Rollback segments are reactivated so that they can be
   assigned to new transactions.

###### Manual Truncation

Manual truncation of undo tablespaces requires a minimum of
three active undo tablespaces. Two active undo tablespaces are
required at all times to support the possibility that automated
truncation is enabled. A minimum of three undo tablespaces
satisfies this requirement while permitting an undo tablespace
to be taken offline manually.

To manually initiate truncation of an undo tablespace,
deactivate the undo tablespace by issuing the following
statement:

```sql
ALTER UNDO TABLESPACE tablespace_name SET INACTIVE;
```

After the undo tablespace is marked as inactive, transactions
currently using rollback segments in the undo tablespace are
permitted to finish, as are any transactions started before
those transactions are completed. After transactions are
completed, the purge system frees the rollback segments in the
undo tablespace, the undo tablespace is truncated to its initial
size, and the undo tablespace state changes from
`inactive` to `empty`.

Note

When an `ALTER UNDO TABLESPACE
tablespace_name SET
INACTIVE` statement deactivates an undo tablespace,
the purge thread looks for that undo tablespace at the next
opportunity. Once the undo tablespace is found and marked for
truncation, the purge thread returns with increased frequency
to quickly empty and truncate the undo tablespace.

To check the state of an undo tablespace, query the Information
Schema [`INNODB_TABLESPACES`](information-schema-innodb-tablespaces-table.md "28.4.24 The INFORMATION_SCHEMA INNODB_TABLESPACES Table") table.

```sql
SELECT NAME, STATE FROM INFORMATION_SCHEMA.INNODB_TABLESPACES
  WHERE NAME LIKE 'tablespace_name';
```

Once the undo tablespace is in an `empty`
state, it can be reactivated by issuing the following statement:

```sql
ALTER UNDO TABLESPACE tablespace_name SET ACTIVE;
```

An undo tablespace in an `empty` state can also
be dropped. See [Dropping Undo Tablespaces](innodb-undo-tablespaces.md#innodb-drop-undo-tablespaces "Dropping Undo Tablespaces").

###### Expediting Automated Truncation of Undo Tablespaces

The purge thread is responsible for emptying and truncating undo
tablespaces. By default, the purge thread looks for undo
tablespaces to truncate once every 128 times that purge is
invoked. The frequency with which the purge thread looks for
undo tablespaces to truncate is controlled by the
[`innodb_purge_rseg_truncate_frequency`](innodb-parameters.md#sysvar_innodb_purge_rseg_truncate_frequency)
variable, which has a default setting of 128.

```sql
mysql> SELECT @@innodb_purge_rseg_truncate_frequency;
+----------------------------------------+
| @@innodb_purge_rseg_truncate_frequency |
+----------------------------------------+
|                                    128 |
+----------------------------------------+
```

To increase the frequency, decrease the
[`innodb_purge_rseg_truncate_frequency`](innodb-parameters.md#sysvar_innodb_purge_rseg_truncate_frequency)
setting. For example, to have the purge thread look for undo
tablespaces once every 32 times that purge is invoked, set
[`innodb_purge_rseg_truncate_frequency`](innodb-parameters.md#sysvar_innodb_purge_rseg_truncate_frequency)
to 32.

```sql
mysql> SET GLOBAL innodb_purge_rseg_truncate_frequency=32;
```

###### Performance Impact of Truncating Undo Tablespace Files

When an undo tablespace is truncated, the rollback segments in
the undo tablespace are deactivated. The active rollback
segments in other undo tablespaces assume responsibility for the
entire system load, which may result in a slight performance
degradation. The extent to which performance is affected depends
on a number of factors:

- Number of undo tablespaces
- Number of undo logs
- Undo tablespace size
- Speed of the I/O subsystem
- Existing long running transactions
- System load

The easiest way to avoid the potential performance impact is to
increase the number of undo tablespaces.

###### Monitoring Undo Tablespace Truncation

As of MySQL 8.0.16, `undo` and
`purge` subsystem counters are provided for
monitoring background activities associated with undo log
truncation. For counter names and descriptions, query the
Information Schema [`INNODB_METRICS`](information-schema-innodb-metrics-table.md "28.4.21 The INFORMATION_SCHEMA INNODB_METRICS Table")
table.

```sql
SELECT NAME, SUBSYSTEM, COMMENT FROM INFORMATION_SCHEMA.INNODB_METRICS WHERE NAME LIKE '%truncate%';
```

For information about enabling counters and querying counter
data, see
[Section 17.15.6, “InnoDB INFORMATION\_SCHEMA Metrics Table”](innodb-information-schema-metrics-table.md "17.15.6 InnoDB INFORMATION_SCHEMA Metrics Table").

###### Undo Tablespace Truncation Limit

As of MySQL 8.0.21, the number of truncate operations on the
same undo tablespace between checkpoints is limited to 64. The
limit prevents potential issues caused by an excessive number of
undo tablespace truncate operations, which can occur if
[`innodb_max_undo_log_size`](innodb-parameters.md#sysvar_innodb_max_undo_log_size) is set
too low on a busy system, for example. If the limit is exceeded,
an undo tablespace can still be made inactive, but it is not
truncated until after the next checkpoint. the limit was raised
from 64 to 50,000 in MySQL 8.0.22.

###### Undo Tablespace Truncation Recovery

An undo tablespace truncate operation creates a temporary
`undo_space_number_trunc.log`
file in the server log directory. That log directory is defined
by [`innodb_log_group_home_dir`](innodb-parameters.md#sysvar_innodb_log_group_home_dir).
If a system failure occurs during the truncate operation, the
temporary log file permits the startup process to identify undo
tablespaces that were being truncated and to continue the
operation.

##### Undo Tablespace Status Variables

The following status variables permit tracking the total number
of undo tablespaces, implicit
(`InnoDB`-created) undo tablespaces, explicit
(user-created) undo tablespaces, and the number of active undo
tablespaces:

```sql
mysql> SHOW STATUS LIKE 'Innodb_undo_tablespaces%';
+----------------------------------+-------+
| Variable_name                    | Value |
+----------------------------------+-------+
| Innodb_undo_tablespaces_total    | 2     |
| Innodb_undo_tablespaces_implicit | 2     |
| Innodb_undo_tablespaces_explicit | 0     |
| Innodb_undo_tablespaces_active   | 2     |
+----------------------------------+-------+
```

For status variable descriptions, see
[Section 7.1.10, “Server Status Variables”](server-status-variables.md "7.1.10 Server Status Variables").
