#### B.3.4.1 Case Sensitivity in String Searches

For nonbinary strings ([`CHAR`](char.md "13.3.2 The CHAR and VARCHAR Types"),
[`VARCHAR`](char.md "13.3.2 The CHAR and VARCHAR Types"),
[`TEXT`](blob.md "13.3.4 The BLOB and TEXT Types")), string searches use the
collation of the comparison operands. For binary strings
([`BINARY`](binary-varbinary.md "13.3.3 The BINARY and VARBINARY Types"),
[`VARBINARY`](binary-varbinary.md "13.3.3 The BINARY and VARBINARY Types"),
[`BLOB`](blob.md "13.3.4 The BLOB and TEXT Types")), comparisons use the
numeric values of the bytes in the operands; this means that
for alphabetic characters, comparisons are case-sensitive.

A comparison between a nonbinary string and binary string is
treated as a comparison of binary strings.

Simple comparison operations (`>=, >, =, <,
<=`, sorting, and grouping) are based on each
character's “sort value.” Characters with the
same sort value are treated as the same character. For
example, if `e` and
`é` have the same sort value in a
given collation, they compare as equal.

The default character set and collation are
`utf8mb4` and
`utf8mb4_0900_ai_ci`, so nonbinary string
comparisons are case-insensitive by default. This means that
if you search with
`col_name LIKE
'a%'`, you get all column values that start with
`A` or `a`. To make this
search case-sensitive, make sure that one of the operands has
a case-sensitive or binary collation. For example, if you are
comparing a column and a string that both have the
`utf8mb4` character set, you can use the
`COLLATE` operator to cause either operand to
have the `utf8mb4_0900_as_cs` or
`utf8mb4_bin` collation:

```sql
col_name COLLATE utf8mb4_0900_as_cs LIKE 'a%'
col_name LIKE 'a%' COLLATE utf8mb4_0900_as_cs
col_name COLLATE utf8mb4_bin LIKE 'a%'
col_name LIKE 'a%' COLLATE utf8mb4_bin
```

If you want a column always to be treated in case-sensitive
fashion, declare it with a case-sensitive or binary collation.
See [Section 15.1.20, “CREATE TABLE Statement”](create-table.md "15.1.20 CREATE TABLE Statement").

To cause a case-sensitive comparison of nonbinary strings to
be case-insensitive, use `COLLATE` to name a
case-insensitive collation. The strings in the following
example normally are case-sensitive, but
`COLLATE` changes the comparison to be
case-insensitive:

```sql
mysql> SET NAMES 'utf8mb4';
mysql> SET @s1 = 'MySQL' COLLATE utf8mb4_bin,
           @s2 = 'mysql' COLLATE utf8mb4_bin;
mysql> SELECT @s1 = @s2;
+-----------+
| @s1 = @s2 |
+-----------+
|         0 |
+-----------+
mysql> SELECT @s1 COLLATE utf8mb4_0900_ai_ci = @s2;
+--------------------------------------+
| @s1 COLLATE utf8mb4_0900_ai_ci = @s2 |
+--------------------------------------+
|                                    1 |
+--------------------------------------+
```

A binary string is case-sensitive in comparisons. To compare
the string as case-insensitive, convert it to a nonbinary
string and use `COLLATE` to name a
case-insensitive collation:

```sql
mysql> SET @s = BINARY 'MySQL';
mysql> SELECT @s = 'mysql';
+--------------+
| @s = 'mysql' |
+--------------+
|            0 |
+--------------+
mysql> SELECT CONVERT(@s USING utf8mb4) COLLATE utf8mb4_0900_ai_ci = 'mysql';
+----------------------------------------------------------------+
| CONVERT(@s USING utf8mb4) COLLATE utf8mb4_0900_ai_ci = 'mysql' |
+----------------------------------------------------------------+
|                                                              1 |
+----------------------------------------------------------------+
```

To determine whether a value is compared as a nonbinary or
binary string, use the
[`COLLATION()`](information-functions.md#function_collation) function. This
example shows that [`VERSION()`](information-functions.md#function_version)
returns a string that has a case-insensitive collation, so
comparisons are case-insensitive:

```sql
mysql> SELECT COLLATION(VERSION());
+----------------------+
| COLLATION(VERSION()) |
+----------------------+
| utf8mb3_general_ci   |
+----------------------+
```

For binary strings, the collation value is
`binary`, so comparisons are case sensitive.
One context in which you can expect to see
`binary` is for compression functions, which
return binary strings as a general rule: string:

```sql
mysql> SELECT COLLATION(COMPRESS('x'));
+--------------------------+
| COLLATION(COMPRESS('x')) |
+--------------------------+
| binary                   |
+--------------------------+
```

To check the sort value of a string, the
[`WEIGHT_STRING()`](string-functions.md#function_weight-string) may be helpful.
See [Section 14.8, “String Functions and Operators”](string-functions.md "14.8 String Functions and Operators").
