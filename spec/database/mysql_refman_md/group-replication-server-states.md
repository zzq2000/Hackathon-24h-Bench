### 20.4.2 Group Replication Server States

The state of a Group Replication group member shows its current
role in the group. The Performance Schema table
[`replication_group_members`](performance-schema-replication-group-members-table.md "29.12.11.16 The replication_group_members Table") shows the
state for each member in a group. If the group is fully functional
and all members are communicating properly, all members report the
same state for all other members. However, a member that has left
the group or is part of a network partition cannot report accurate
information on the other servers. In this situation, the member
does not attempt to guess the status of the other servers, and
instead reports them as unreachable.

A group member can be in the following states:

`ONLINE`
:   The server is an active member of a group and in a fully
    functioning state. Other group members can connect to it, as
    can clients if applicable. A member is only fully
    synchronized with the group, and participating in it, when
    it is in the `ONLINE` state.

`RECOVERING`
:   The server has joined a group and is in the process of
    becoming an active member. Distributed recovery is currently
    taking place, where the member is receiving state transfer
    from a donor using a remote cloning operation or the donor's
    binary log. This state is

    For more information, see
    [Section 20.5.4, “Distributed Recovery”](group-replication-distributed-recovery.md "20.5.4 Distributed Recovery").

`OFFLINE`
:   The Group Replication plugin is loaded but the member does
    not belong to any group. This status may briefly occur while
    a member is joining or rejoining a group.

`ERROR`
:   The member is in an error state and is not functioning
    correctly as a group member. A member can enter error state
    either while applying transactions or during the recovery
    phase. A member in this state does not participate in the
    group's transactions. For more information on possible
    reasons for error states, see
    [Section 20.7.7, “Responses to Failure Detection and Network Partitioning”](group-replication-responses-failure.md "20.7.7 Responses to Failure Detection and Network Partitioning").

    Depending on the exit action set by
    [`group_replication_exit_state_action`](group-replication-system-variables.md#sysvar_group_replication_exit_state_action),
    the member is in read-only mode
    ([`super_read_only=ON`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_super_read_only)) and
    could also be in offline mode
    ([`offline_mode=ON`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_offline_mode)). Note
    that a server in offline mode following the
    `OFFLINE_MODE` exit action is displayed
    with `ERROR` status, not
    `OFFLINE`. A server with the exit action
    `ABORT_SERVER` shuts down and is removed
    from the view of the group. For more information, see
    [Section 20.7.7.4, “Exit Action”](group-replication-responses-failure-exit.md "20.7.7.4 Exit Action").

    While a member is joining or rejoining a replication group,
    its status can be displayed as `ERROR`
    before the group completes the compatibility checks and
    accepts it as a member.

`UNREACHABLE`
:   The local failure detector suspects that the member cannot
    be contacted, because the group's messages are timing out.
    This can happen if a member is disconnected involuntarily,
    for example. If you see this status for other servers, it
    can also mean that the member where you query this table is
    part of a partition, where a subset of the group's servers
    can contact each other but cannot contact the other servers
    in the group. For more information, see
    [Section 20.7.8, “Handling a Network Partition and Loss of Quorum”](group-replication-network-partitioning.md "20.7.8 Handling a Network Partition and Loss of Quorum").
