### 18.8.2 How to Create FEDERATED Tables

[18.8.2.2 Creating a FEDERATED Table Using CREATE SERVER](federated-create-server.md)

To create a `FEDERATED` table you should follow
these steps:

1. Create the table on the remote server. Alternatively, make a
   note of the table definition of an existing table, perhaps
   using the [`SHOW CREATE TABLE`](show-create-table.md "15.7.7.10 SHOW CREATE TABLE Statement")
   statement.
2. Create the table on the local server with an identical table
   definition, but adding the connection information that links
   the local table to the remote table.

For example, you could create the following table on the remote
server:

```sql
CREATE TABLE test_table (
    id     INT(20) NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT,
    name   VARCHAR(32) NOT NULL DEFAULT '',
    other  INT(20) NOT NULL DEFAULT '0',
    PRIMARY KEY  (id),
    INDEX name (name),
    INDEX other_key (other)
)
ENGINE=MyISAM
DEFAULT CHARSET=utf8mb4;
```

To create the local table that is federated to the remote table,
there are two options available. You can either create the local
table and specify the connection string (containing the server
name, login, password) to be used to connect to the remote table
using the `CONNECTION`, or you can use an
existing connection that you have previously created using the
[`CREATE SERVER`](create-server.md "15.1.18 CREATE SERVER Statement") statement.

Important

When you create the local table it *must*
have an identical field definition to the remote table.

Note

You can improve the performance of a
`FEDERATED` table by adding indexes to the
table on the host. The optimization occurs because the query
sent to the remote server includes the contents of the
`WHERE` clause and is sent to the remote server
and subsequently executed locally. This reduces the network
traffic that would otherwise request the entire table from the
server for local processing.
