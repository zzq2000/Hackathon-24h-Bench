#### 19.2.5.3 Interactions Between Replication Filtering Options

If you use a combination of database-level and table-level
replication filtering options, the replica first accepts or
ignores events using the database options, then it evaluates all
events permitted by those options according to the table
options. This can sometimes lead to results that seem
counterintuitive. It is also important to note that the results
vary depending on whether the operation is logged using
statement-based or row-based binary logging format. If you want
to be sure that your replication filters always operate in the
same way independently of the binary logging format, which is
particularly important if you are using mixed binary logging
format, follow the guidance in this topic.

The effect of the replication filtering options differs between
binary logging formats because of the way the database name is
identified. With statement-based format, DML statements are
handled based on the current database, as specified by the
[`USE`](use.md "15.8.4 USE Statement") statement. With row-based
format, DML statements are handled based on the database where
the modified table exists. DDL statements are always filtered
based on the current database, as specified by the
[`USE`](use.md "15.8.4 USE Statement") statement, regardless of the
binary logging format.

An operation that involves multiple tables can also be affected
differently by replication filtering options depending on the
binary logging format. Operations to watch out for include
transactions involving multi-table
[`UPDATE`](update.md "15.2.17 UPDATE Statement") statements, triggers,
cascading foreign keys, stored functions that update multiple
tables, and DML statements that invoke stored functions that
update one or more tables. If these operations update both
filtered-in and filtered-out tables, the results can vary with
the binary logging format.

If you need to guarantee that your replication filters operate
consistently regardless of the binary logging format,
particularly if you are using mixed binary logging format
([`binlog_format=MIXED`](replication-options-binary-log.md#sysvar_binlog_format)), use only
table-level replication filtering options, and do not use
database-level replication filtering options. Also, do not use
multi-table DML statements that update both filtered-in and
filtered-out tables.

If you need to use a combination of database-level and
table-level replication filters, and want these to operate as
consistently as possible, choose one of the following
strategies:

1. If you use row-based binary logging format
   ([`binlog_format=ROW`](replication-options-binary-log.md#sysvar_binlog_format)), for
   DDL statements, rely on the
   [`USE`](use.md "15.8.4 USE Statement") statement to set the
   database and do not specify the database name. You can
   consider changing to row-based binary logging format for
   improved consistency with replication filtering. See
   [Section 7.4.4.2, “Setting The Binary Log Format”](binary-log-setting.md "7.4.4.2 Setting The Binary Log Format") for the conditions that
   apply to changing the binary logging format.
2. If you use statement-based or mixed binary logging format
   ([`binlog_format=STATEMENT`](replication-options-binary-log.md#sysvar_binlog_format) or
   `MIXED`), for both DML and DDL statements,
   rely on the [`USE`](use.md "15.8.4 USE Statement") statement and
   do not use the database name. Also, do not use multi-table
   DML statements that update both filtered-in and filtered-out
   tables.

**Example 19.7 A [`--replicate-ignore-db`](replication-options-replica.md#option_mysqld_replicate-ignore-db) option and a
[`--replicate-do-table`](replication-options-replica.md#option_mysqld_replicate-do-table) option**

On the replication source server, the following statements are
issued:

```sql
USE db1;
CREATE TABLE t2 LIKE t1;
INSERT INTO db2.t3 VALUES (1);
```

The replica has the following replication filtering options
set:

```simple
replicate-ignore-db = db1
replicate-do-table = db2.t3
```

The DDL statement [`CREATE TABLE`](create-table.md "15.1.20 CREATE TABLE Statement")
creates the table in `db1`, as specified by
the preceding [`USE`](use.md "15.8.4 USE Statement") statement.
The replica filters out this statement according to its
[`--replicate-ignore-db = db1`](replication-options-replica.md#option_mysqld_replicate-ignore-db)
option, because `db1` is the current
database. This result is the same whatever the binary logging
format is on the replication source server. However, the
result of the DML [`INSERT`](insert.md "15.2.7 INSERT Statement")
statement is different depending on the binary logging format:

- If row-based binary logging format is in use on the source
  ([`binlog_format=ROW`](replication-options-binary-log.md#sysvar_binlog_format)), the
  replica evaluates the
  [`INSERT`](insert.md "15.2.7 INSERT Statement") operation using the
  database where the table exists, which is named as
  `db2`. The database-level option
  [`--replicate-ignore-db =
  db1`](replication-options-replica.md#option_mysqld_replicate-ignore-db), which is evaluated first, therefore does not
  apply. The table-level option
  [`--replicate-do-table =
  db2.t3`](replication-options-replica.md#option_mysqld_replicate-do-table) does apply, so the replica applies the
  change to table `t3`.
- If statement-based binary logging format is in use on the
  source
  ([`binlog_format=STATEMENT`](replication-options-binary-log.md#sysvar_binlog_format)),
  the replica evaluates the
  [`INSERT`](insert.md "15.2.7 INSERT Statement") operation using the
  default database, which was set by the
  [`USE`](use.md "15.8.4 USE Statement") statement to
  `db1` and has not been changed. According
  to its database-level
  [`--replicate-ignore-db = db1`](replication-options-replica.md#option_mysqld_replicate-ignore-db)
  option, it therefore ignores the operation and does not
  apply the change to table `t3`. The
  table-level option
  [`--replicate-do-table =
  db2.t3`](replication-options-replica.md#option_mysqld_replicate-do-table) is not checked, because the statement
  already matched a database-level option and was ignored.

If the [`--replicate-ignore-db =
db1`](replication-options-replica.md#option_mysqld_replicate-ignore-db) option on the replica is necessary, and the use
of statement-based (or mixed) binary logging format on the
source is also necessary, the results can be made consistent
by omitting the database name from the
[`INSERT`](insert.md "15.2.7 INSERT Statement") statement and relying on
a [`USE`](use.md "15.8.4 USE Statement") statement instead, as
follows:

```sql
USE db1;
CREATE TABLE t2 LIKE t1;
USE db2;
INSERT INTO t3 VALUES (1);
```

In this case, the replica always evaluates the
[`INSERT`](insert.md "15.2.7 INSERT Statement") statement based on the
database `db2`. Whether the operation is
logged in statement-based or row-based binary format, the
results remain the same.
