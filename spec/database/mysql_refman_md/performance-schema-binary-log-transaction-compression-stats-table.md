#### 29.12.11.1 The binary\_log\_transaction\_compression\_stats Table

This table shows statistical information for transaction
payloads written to the binary log and relay log, and can be
used to calculate the effects of enabling binary log
transaction compression. For information on binary log
transaction compression, see
[Section 7.4.4.5, “Binary Log Transaction Compression”](binary-log-transaction-compression.md "7.4.4.5 Binary Log Transaction Compression").

The
`binary_log_transaction_compression_stats`
table is populated only when the server instance has a binary
log, and the system variable
[`binlog_transaction_compression`](replication-options-binary-log.md#sysvar_binlog_transaction_compression)
is set to `ON`. The statistics cover all
transactions written to the binary log and relay log from the
time the server was started or the table was truncated.
Compressed transactions are grouped by the compression
algorithm used, and uncompressed transactions are grouped
together with the compression algorithm stated as
`NONE`, so the compression ratio can be
calculated.

The
`binary_log_transaction_compression_stats`
table has these columns:

- `LOG_TYPE`

  Whether these transactions were written to the binary log
  or relay log.
- `COMPRESSION_TYPE`

  The compression algorithm used to compress the transaction
  payloads. `NONE` means the payloads for
  these transactions were not compressed, which is correct
  in a number of situations (see
  [Section 7.4.4.5, “Binary Log Transaction Compression”](binary-log-transaction-compression.md "7.4.4.5 Binary Log Transaction Compression")).
- `TRANSACTION_COUNTER`

  The number of transactions written to this log type with
  this compression type.
- `COMPRESSED_BYTES`

  The total number of bytes that were compressed and then
  written to this log type with this compression type,
  counted after compression.
- `UNCOMPRESSED_BYTES`

  The total number of bytes before compression for this log
  type and this compression type.
- `COMPRESSION_PERCENTAGE`

  The compression ratio for this log type and this
  compression type, expressed as a percentage.
- `FIRST_TRANSACTION_ID`

  The ID of the first transaction that was written to this
  log type with this compression type.
- `FIRST_TRANSACTION_COMPRESSED_BYTES`

  The total number of bytes that were compressed and then
  written to the log for the first transaction, counted
  after compression.
- `FIRST_TRANSACTION_UNCOMPRESSED_BYTES`

  The total number of bytes before compression for the first
  transaction.
- `FIRST_TRANSACTION_TIMESTAMP`

  The timestamp when the first transaction was written to
  the log.
- `LAST_TRANSACTION_ID`

  The ID of the most recent transaction that was written to
  this log type with this compression type.
- `LAST_TRANSACTION_COMPRESSED_BYTES`

  The total number of bytes that were compressed and then
  written to the log for the most recent transaction,
  counted after compression.
- `LAST_TRANSACTION_UNCOMPRESSED_BYTES`

  The total number of bytes before compression for the most
  recent transaction.
- `LAST_TRANSACTION_TIMESTAMP`

  The timestamp when the most recent transaction was written
  to the log.

The
`binary_log_transaction_compression_stats`
table has no indexes.

[`TRUNCATE TABLE`](truncate-table.md "15.1.37 TRUNCATE TABLE Statement") is permitted for
the
`binary_log_transaction_compression_stats`
table.
