## 26.6 Restrictions and Limitations on Partitioning

[26.6.1 Partitioning Keys, Primary Keys, and Unique Keys](partitioning-limitations-partitioning-keys-unique-keys.md)

[26.6.2 Partitioning Limitations Relating to Storage Engines](partitioning-limitations-storage-engines.md)

[26.6.3 Partitioning Limitations Relating to Functions](partitioning-limitations-functions.md)

This section discusses current restrictions and limitations on
MySQL partitioning support.

**Prohibited constructs.**
The following constructs are not permitted in partitioning
expressions:

- Stored procedures, stored functions, loadable functions, or
  plugins.
- Declared variables or user variables.

For a list of SQL functions which are permitted in partitioning
expressions, see
[Section 26.6.3, “Partitioning Limitations Relating to Functions”](partitioning-limitations-functions.md "26.6.3 Partitioning Limitations Relating to Functions").

**Arithmetic and logical operators.**

Use of the arithmetic operators
[`+`](arithmetic-functions.md#operator_plus),
[`-`](arithmetic-functions.md#operator_minus), and
[`*`](arithmetic-functions.md#operator_times) is permitted in
partitioning expressions. However, the result must be an integer
value or `NULL` (except in the case of
`[LINEAR] KEY` partitioning, as discussed
elsewhere in this chapter; see
[Section 26.2, “Partitioning Types”](partitioning-types.md "26.2 Partitioning Types"), for more information).

The [`DIV`](arithmetic-functions.md#operator_div) operator is also supported;
the [`/`](arithmetic-functions.md#operator_divide) operator is
not permitted.

The bit operators
[`|`](bit-functions.md#operator_bitwise-or),
[`&`](bit-functions.md#operator_bitwise-and),
[`^`](bit-functions.md#operator_bitwise-xor),
[`<<`](bit-functions.md#operator_left-shift),
[`>>`](bit-functions.md#operator_right-shift), and
[`~`](bit-functions.md#operator_bitwise-invert) are not
permitted in partitioning expressions.

**Server SQL mode.**

Tables employing user-defined partitioning do not preserve the
SQL mode in effect at the time that they were created. As
discussed elsewhere in this Manual (see
[Section 7.1.11, “Server SQL Modes”](sql-mode.md "7.1.11 Server SQL Modes")), the results of many MySQL functions
and operators may change according to the server SQL mode.
Therefore, a change in the SQL mode at any time after the
creation of partitioned tables may lead to major changes in the
behavior of such tables, and could easily lead to corruption or
loss of data. For these reasons, *it is strongly
recommended that you never change the server SQL mode after
creating partitioned tables*.

For one such change in the server SQL mode making a partitioned
tables unusable, consider the following
[`CREATE TABLE`](create-table.md "15.1.20 CREATE TABLE Statement") statement, which can
be executed successfully only if the
[`NO_UNSIGNED_SUBTRACTION`](sql-mode.md#sqlmode_no_unsigned_subtraction) mode is
in effect:

```sql
mysql> SELECT @@sql_mode;
+------------+
| @@sql_mode |
+------------+
|            |
+------------+
1 row in set (0.00 sec)

mysql> CREATE TABLE tu (c1 BIGINT UNSIGNED)
    ->   PARTITION BY RANGE(c1 - 10) (
    ->     PARTITION p0 VALUES LESS THAN (-5),
    ->     PARTITION p1 VALUES LESS THAN (0),
    ->     PARTITION p2 VALUES LESS THAN (5),
    ->     PARTITION p3 VALUES LESS THAN (10),
    ->     PARTITION p4 VALUES LESS THAN (MAXVALUE)
    -> );
ERROR 1563 (HY000): Partition constant is out of partition function domain

mysql> SET sql_mode='NO_UNSIGNED_SUBTRACTION';
Query OK, 0 rows affected (0.00 sec)

mysql> SELECT @@sql_mode;
+-------------------------+
| @@sql_mode              |
+-------------------------+
| NO_UNSIGNED_SUBTRACTION |
+-------------------------+
1 row in set (0.00 sec)

mysql> CREATE TABLE tu (c1 BIGINT UNSIGNED)
    ->   PARTITION BY RANGE(c1 - 10) (
    ->     PARTITION p0 VALUES LESS THAN (-5),
    ->     PARTITION p1 VALUES LESS THAN (0),
    ->     PARTITION p2 VALUES LESS THAN (5),
    ->     PARTITION p3 VALUES LESS THAN (10),
    ->     PARTITION p4 VALUES LESS THAN (MAXVALUE)
    -> );
Query OK, 0 rows affected (0.05 sec)
```

If you remove the
[`NO_UNSIGNED_SUBTRACTION`](sql-mode.md#sqlmode_no_unsigned_subtraction) server
SQL mode after creating `tu`, you may no longer
be able to access this table:

```sql
mysql> SET sql_mode='';
Query OK, 0 rows affected (0.00 sec)

mysql> SELECT * FROM tu;
ERROR 1563 (HY000): Partition constant is out of partition function domain
mysql> INSERT INTO tu VALUES (20);
ERROR 1563 (HY000): Partition constant is out of partition function domain
```

See also [Section 7.1.11, “Server SQL Modes”](sql-mode.md "7.1.11 Server SQL Modes").

Server SQL modes also impact replication of partitioned tables.
Disparate SQL modes on source and replica can lead to partitioning
expressions being evaluated differently; this can cause the
distribution of data among partitions to be different in the
source's and replica's copies of a given table, and may
even cause inserts into partitioned tables that succeed on the
source to fail on the replica. For best results, you should always
use the same server SQL mode on the source and on the replica.

**Performance considerations.**
Some effects of partitioning operations on performance are given
in the following list:

- **File system operations.**
  Partitioning and repartitioning operations (such as
  [`ALTER
  TABLE`](alter-table-partition-operations.md "15.1.9.1 ALTER TABLE Partition Operations") with `PARTITION BY ...`,
  `REORGANIZE PARTITION`, or `REMOVE
  PARTITIONING`) depend on file system operations for
  their implementation. This means that the speed of these
  operations is affected by such factors as file system type
  and characteristics, disk speed, swap space, file handling
  efficiency of the operating system, and MySQL server options
  and variables that relate to file handling. In particular,
  you should make sure that
  [`large_files_support`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_large_files_support) is
  enabled and that
  [`open_files_limit`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_open_files_limit) is set
  properly. Partitioning and repartitioning operations
  involving `InnoDB` tables may be made more
  efficient by enabling
  [`innodb_file_per_table`](innodb-parameters.md#sysvar_innodb_file_per_table).

  See also
  [Maximum number of partitions](partitioning-limitations.md#partitioning-limitations-max-partitions "Maximum number of partitions").
- **Table locks.**
  Generally, the process executing a partitioning operation on
  a table takes a write lock on the table. Reads from such
  tables are relatively unaffected; pending
  [`INSERT`](insert.md "15.2.7 INSERT Statement") and
  [`UPDATE`](update.md "15.2.17 UPDATE Statement") operations are
  performed as soon as the partitioning operation has
  completed. For `InnoDB`-specific exceptions
  to this limitation, see
  [Partitioning Operations](innodb-online-ddl-operations.md#online-ddl-partitioning "Partitioning Operations").
- **Indexes; partition pruning.**
  As with nonpartitioned tables, proper use of indexes can
  speed up queries on partitioned tables significantly. In
  addition, designing partitioned tables and queries on these
  tables to take advantage of
  partition pruning can
  improve performance dramatically. See
  [Section 26.4, “Partition Pruning”](partitioning-pruning.md "26.4 Partition Pruning"), for more
  information.

  Index condition pushdown is supported for partitioned tables.
  See [Section 10.2.1.6, “Index Condition Pushdown Optimization”](index-condition-pushdown-optimization.md "10.2.1.6 Index Condition Pushdown Optimization").
- **Performance with LOAD DATA.**
  In MySQL 8.0, [`LOAD
  DATA`](load-data.md "15.2.9 LOAD DATA Statement") uses buffering to improve performance. You
  should be aware that the buffer uses 130 KB memory per
  partition to achieve this.

**Maximum number of partitions.**
The maximum possible number of partitions for a given table not
using the [`NDB`](mysql-cluster.md "Chapter 25 MySQL NDB Cluster 8.0") storage engine is
8192. This number includes subpartitions.

The maximum possible number of user-defined partitions for a table
using the [`NDB`](mysql-cluster.md "Chapter 25 MySQL NDB Cluster 8.0") storage engine is
determined according to the version of the NDB Cluster software
being used, the number of data nodes, and other factors. See
[NDB and user-defined partitioning](mysql-cluster-nodes-groups.md#mysql-cluster-nodes-groups-user-partitioning "NDB and user-defined partitioning"),
for more information.

If, when creating tables with a large number of partitions (but
less than the maximum), you encounter an error message such as
Got error ... from storage engine: Out of resources
when opening file, you may be able to address the
issue by increasing the value of the
[`open_files_limit`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_open_files_limit) system variable.
However, this is dependent on the operating system, and may not be
possible or advisable on all platforms; see
[Section B.3.2.16, “File Not Found and Similar Errors”](not-enough-file-handles.md "B.3.2.16 File Not Found and Similar Errors"), for more information.
In some cases, using large numbers (hundreds) of partitions may
also not be advisable due to other concerns, so using more
partitions does not automatically lead to better results.

See also
[File system operations](partitioning-limitations.md#partitioning-limitations-file-system-ops "File system operations").

**Foreign keys not supported for partitioned InnoDB tables.**
Partitioned tables using the [`InnoDB`](innodb-storage-engine.md "Chapter 17 The InnoDB Storage Engine")
storage engine do not support foreign keys. More specifically,
this means that the following two statements are true:

1. No definition of an `InnoDB` table employing
   user-defined partitioning may contain foreign key references;
   no `InnoDB` table whose definition contains
   foreign key references may be partitioned.
2. No `InnoDB` table definition may contain a
   foreign key reference to a user-partitioned table; no
   `InnoDB` table with user-defined partitioning
   may contain columns referenced by foreign keys.

The scope of the restrictions just listed includes all tables that
use the `InnoDB` storage engine.
[`CREATE
TABLE`](create-table-foreign-keys.md "15.1.20.5 FOREIGN KEY Constraints") and [`ALTER TABLE`](alter-table.md "15.1.9 ALTER TABLE Statement")
statements that would result in tables violating these
restrictions are not allowed.

**ALTER TABLE ... ORDER BY.**
An `ALTER TABLE ... ORDER BY
column` statement run
against a partitioned table causes ordering of rows only within
each partition.

**ADD COLUMN ... ALGORITHM=INSTANT.**
Once you perform
[`ALTER TABLE ... ADD
COLUMN ... ALGORITHM=INSTANT`](alter-table.md "15.1.9 ALTER TABLE Statement") on a partitioned table,
it is no longer possible to exchange partitions with this table.

**Effects on REPLACE statements by modification of primary keys.**
It can be desirable in some cases (see
[Section 26.6.1, “Partitioning Keys, Primary Keys, and Unique Keys”](partitioning-limitations-partitioning-keys-unique-keys.md "26.6.1 Partitioning Keys, Primary Keys, and Unique Keys"))
to modify a table's primary key. Be aware that, if your
application uses [`REPLACE`](replace.md "15.2.12 REPLACE Statement")
statements and you do this, the results of these statements can
be drastically altered. See [Section 15.2.12, “REPLACE Statement”](replace.md "15.2.12 REPLACE Statement"), for more
information and an example.

**FULLTEXT indexes.**
Partitioned tables do not support `FULLTEXT`
indexes or searches.

**Spatial columns.**
Columns with spatial data types such as `POINT`
or `GEOMETRY` cannot be used in partitioned
tables.

**Temporary tables.**
Temporary tables cannot be partitioned.

**Log tables.**
It is not possible to partition the log tables; an
[`ALTER
TABLE ... PARTITION BY ...`](alter-table-partition-operations.md "15.1.9.1 ALTER TABLE Partition Operations") statement on such a table
fails with an error.

**Data type of partitioning key.**
A partitioning key must be either an integer column or an
expression that resolves to an integer. Expressions employing
[`ENUM`](enum.md "13.3.5 The ENUM Type") columns cannot be used. The
column or expression value may also be `NULL`;
see [Section 26.2.7, “How MySQL Partitioning Handles NULL”](partitioning-handling-nulls.md "26.2.7 How MySQL Partitioning Handles NULL").

There are two exceptions to this restriction:

1. When partitioning by [`LINEAR`]
   `KEY`, it is possible to use columns of any
   valid MySQL data type other than
   [`TEXT`](blob.md "13.3.4 The BLOB and TEXT Types") or
   [`BLOB`](blob.md "13.3.4 The BLOB and TEXT Types") as partitioning keys,
   because the internal key-hashing functions produce the correct
   data type from these types. For example, the following two
   [`CREATE TABLE`](create-table.md "15.1.20 CREATE TABLE Statement") statements are
   valid:

   ```sql
   CREATE TABLE tkc (c1 CHAR)
   PARTITION BY KEY(c1)
   PARTITIONS 4;

   CREATE TABLE tke
       ( c1 ENUM('red', 'orange', 'yellow', 'green', 'blue', 'indigo', 'violet') )
   PARTITION BY LINEAR KEY(c1)
   PARTITIONS 6;
   ```
2. When partitioning by `RANGE COLUMNS` or
   `LIST COLUMNS`, it is possible to use string,
   [`DATE`](datetime.md "13.2.2 The DATE, DATETIME, and TIMESTAMP Types"), and
   [`DATETIME`](datetime.md "13.2.2 The DATE, DATETIME, and TIMESTAMP Types") columns. For example,
   each of the following [`CREATE
   TABLE`](create-table.md "15.1.20 CREATE TABLE Statement") statements is valid:

   ```sql
   CREATE TABLE rc (c1 INT, c2 DATE)
   PARTITION BY RANGE COLUMNS(c2) (
       PARTITION p0 VALUES LESS THAN('1990-01-01'),
       PARTITION p1 VALUES LESS THAN('1995-01-01'),
       PARTITION p2 VALUES LESS THAN('2000-01-01'),
       PARTITION p3 VALUES LESS THAN('2005-01-01'),
       PARTITION p4 VALUES LESS THAN(MAXVALUE)
   );

   CREATE TABLE lc (c1 INT, c2 CHAR(1))
   PARTITION BY LIST COLUMNS(c2) (
       PARTITION p0 VALUES IN('a', 'd', 'g', 'j', 'm', 'p', 's', 'v', 'y'),
       PARTITION p1 VALUES IN('b', 'e', 'h', 'k', 'n', 'q', 't', 'w', 'z'),
       PARTITION p2 VALUES IN('c', 'f', 'i', 'l', 'o', 'r', 'u', 'x', NULL)
   );
   ```

Neither of the preceding exceptions applies to
[`BLOB`](blob.md "13.3.4 The BLOB and TEXT Types") or
[`TEXT`](blob.md "13.3.4 The BLOB and TEXT Types") column types.

**Subqueries.**
A partitioning key may not be a subquery, even if that subquery
resolves to an integer value or `NULL`.

**Column index prefixes not supported for key partitioning.**
When creating a table that is partitioned by key, any columns in
the partitioning key which use column prefixes are not used in
the table's partitioning function. Consider the following
[`CREATE TABLE`](create-table.md "15.1.20 CREATE TABLE Statement") statement, which has
three [`VARCHAR`](char.md "13.3.2 The CHAR and VARCHAR Types") columns, and whose
primary key uses all three columns and specifies prefixes for
two of them:

```sql
CREATE TABLE t1 (
    a VARCHAR(10000),
    b VARCHAR(25),
    c VARCHAR(10),
    PRIMARY KEY (a(10), b, c(2))
) PARTITION BY KEY() PARTITIONS 2;
```

This statement is accepted, but the resulting table is actually
created as if you had issued the following statement, using only
the primary key column which does not include a prefix (column
`b`) for the partitioning key:

```sql
CREATE TABLE t1 (
    a VARCHAR(10000),
    b VARCHAR(25),
    c VARCHAR(10),
    PRIMARY KEY (a(10), b, c(2))
) PARTITION BY KEY(b) PARTITIONS 2;
```

Prior to MySQL 8.0.21, no warning was issued or any other
indication provided that this occurred, except in the event that
all columns specified for the partitioning key used prefixes, in
which case the statement failed, but with a misleading error
message, as shown here:

```sql
mysql> CREATE TABLE t2 (
    ->     a VARCHAR(10000),
    ->     b VARCHAR(25),
    ->     c VARCHAR(10),
    ->     PRIMARY KEY (a(10), b(5), c(2))
    -> ) PARTITION BY KEY() PARTITIONS 2;
ERROR 1503 (HY000): A PRIMARY KEY must include all columns in the
table's partitioning function
```

This also occurred when performing [`ALTER
TABLE`](alter-table.md "15.1.9 ALTER TABLE Statement") or when upgrading such tables.

This permissive behavior is deprecated as of MySQL 8.0.21 (and is
subject to removal in a future version of MySQL). Beginning with
MySQL 8.0.21, using one or more columns having a prefix in the
partitioning key results in a warning for each such column, as
shown here:

```sql
mysql> CREATE TABLE t1 (
    ->     a VARCHAR(10000),
    ->     b VARCHAR(25),
    ->     c VARCHAR(10),
    ->     PRIMARY KEY (a(10), b, c(2))
    -> ) PARTITION BY KEY() PARTITIONS 2;
Query OK, 0 rows affected, 2 warnings (1.25 sec)

mysql> SHOW WARNINGS\G
*************************** 1. row ***************************
  Level: Warning
   Code: 1681
Message: Column 'test.t1.a' having prefix key part 'a(10)' is ignored by the
partitioning function. Use of prefixed columns in the PARTITION BY KEY() clause

*************************** 2. row ***************************
  Level: Warning
   Code: 1681
Message: Column 'test.t1.c' having prefix key part 'c(2)' is ignored by the
partitioning function. Use of prefixed columns in the PARTITION BY KEY() clause
is deprecated and will be removed in a future release.
2 rows in set (0.00 sec)
```

This includes cases in which the columns used in the partitioning
function are defined implicitly as those in the table's
primary key by employing an empty `PARTITION BY
KEY()` clause.

In MySQL 8.0.21 and later, if all columns specified for the
partitioning key employ prefixes, the `CREATE
TABLE` statement used fails with an error message that
identifies the issue correctly:

```sql
mysql> CREATE TABLE t1 (
    ->     a VARCHAR(10000),
    ->     b VARCHAR(25),
    ->     c VARCHAR(10),
    ->     PRIMARY KEY (a(10), b(5), c(2))
    -> ) PARTITION BY KEY() PARTITIONS 2;
ERROR 1503 (HY000): A PRIMARY KEY must include all columns in the table's
partitioning function (prefixed columns are not considered).
```

For general information about partitioning tables by key, see
[Section 26.2.5, “KEY Partitioning”](partitioning-key.md "26.2.5 KEY Partitioning").

**Issues with subpartitions.**
Subpartitions must use `HASH` or
`KEY` partitioning. Only
`RANGE` and `LIST` partitions
may be subpartitioned; `HASH` and
`KEY` partitions cannot be subpartitioned.

`SUBPARTITION BY KEY` requires that the
subpartitioning column or columns be specified explicitly, unlike
the case with `PARTITION BY KEY`, where it can be
omitted (in which case the table's primary key column is used
by default). Consider the table created by this statement:

```sql
CREATE TABLE ts (
    id INT NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
    name VARCHAR(30)
);
```

You can create a table having the same columns, partitioned by
`KEY`, using a statement such as this one:

```sql
CREATE TABLE ts (
    id INT NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
    name VARCHAR(30)
)
PARTITION BY KEY()
PARTITIONS 4;
```

The previous statement is treated as though it had been written
like this, with the table's primary key column used as the
partitioning column:

```sql
CREATE TABLE ts (
    id INT NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
    name VARCHAR(30)
)
PARTITION BY KEY(id)
PARTITIONS 4;
```

However, the following statement that attempts to create a
subpartitioned table using the default column as the
subpartitioning column fails, and the column must be specified for
the statement to succeed, as shown here:

```sql
mysql> CREATE TABLE ts (
    ->     id INT NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
    ->     name VARCHAR(30)
    -> )
    -> PARTITION BY RANGE(id)
    -> SUBPARTITION BY KEY()
    -> SUBPARTITIONS 4
    -> (
    ->     PARTITION p0 VALUES LESS THAN (100),
    ->     PARTITION p1 VALUES LESS THAN (MAXVALUE)
    -> );
ERROR 1064 (42000): You have an error in your SQL syntax; check the manual that
corresponds to your MySQL server version for the right syntax to use near ')

mysql> CREATE TABLE ts (
    ->     id INT NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
    ->     name VARCHAR(30)
    -> )
    -> PARTITION BY RANGE(id)
    -> SUBPARTITION BY KEY(id)
    -> SUBPARTITIONS 4
    -> (
    ->     PARTITION p0 VALUES LESS THAN (100),
    ->     PARTITION p1 VALUES LESS THAN (MAXVALUE)
    -> );
Query OK, 0 rows affected (0.07 sec)
```

This is a known issue (see Bug #51470).

**DATA DIRECTORY and INDEX DIRECTORY options.**
Table-level `DATA DIRECTORY` and `INDEX
DIRECTORY` options are ignored (see Bug #32091). You
can employ these options for individual partitions or
subpartitions of [`InnoDB`](innodb-storage-engine.md "Chapter 17 The InnoDB Storage Engine") tables. As
of MySQL 8.0.21, the directory specified in a `DATA
DIRECTORY` clause must be known to
`InnoDB`. For more information, see
[Using the DATA DIRECTORY Clause](innodb-create-table-external.md#innodb-create-table-external-data-directory "Using the DATA DIRECTORY Clause").

**Repairing and rebuilding partitioned tables.**
The statements [`CHECK TABLE`](check-table.md "15.7.3.2 CHECK TABLE Statement"),
[`OPTIMIZE TABLE`](optimize-table.md "15.7.3.4 OPTIMIZE TABLE Statement"),
[`ANALYZE TABLE`](analyze-table.md "15.7.3.1 ANALYZE TABLE Statement"), and
[`REPAIR TABLE`](repair-table.md "15.7.3.5 REPAIR TABLE Statement") are supported for
partitioned tables.

In addition, you can use `ALTER TABLE ... REBUILD
PARTITION` to rebuild one or more partitions of a
partitioned table; `ALTER TABLE ... REORGANIZE
PARTITION` also causes partitions to be rebuilt. See
[Section 15.1.9, “ALTER TABLE Statement”](alter-table.md "15.1.9 ALTER TABLE Statement"), for more information about these
two statements.

`ANALYZE`, `CHECK`,
`OPTIMIZE`, `REPAIR`, and
`TRUNCATE` operations are supported with
subpartitions. See
[Section 15.1.9.1, “ALTER TABLE Partition Operations”](alter-table-partition-operations.md "15.1.9.1 ALTER TABLE Partition Operations").

**File name delimiters for partitions and subpartitions.**
Table partition and subpartition file names include generated
delimiters such as `#P#` and
`#SP#`. The lettercase of such delimiters can
vary and should not be depended upon.
