#### B.3.2.8 Packet Too Large

A communication packet is a single SQL statement sent to the
MySQL server, a single row that is sent to the client, or a
binary log event sent from a replication source server to a
replica.

The largest possible packet that can be transmitted to or from
a MySQL 8.0 server or client is 1GB.

When a MySQL client or the [**mysqld**](mysqld.md "6.3.1 mysqld — The MySQL Server") server
receives a packet bigger than
[`max_allowed_packet`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_max_allowed_packet) bytes, it
issues an
[`ER_NET_PACKET_TOO_LARGE`](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/mysql-errors/8.0/en/server-error-reference.html#error_er_net_packet_too_large) error
and closes the connection. With some clients, you may also get
a `Lost connection to MySQL server during
query` error if the communication packet is too
large.

Both the client and the server have their own
[`max_allowed_packet`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_max_allowed_packet) variable,
so if you want to handle big packets, you must increase this
variable both in the client and in the server.

If you are using the [**mysql**](mysql.md "6.5.1 mysql — The MySQL Command-Line Client") client program,
its default
[`max_allowed_packet`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_max_allowed_packet) variable
is 16MB. To set a larger value, start [**mysql**](mysql.md "6.5.1 mysql — The MySQL Command-Line Client")
like this:

```terminal
$> mysql --max_allowed_packet=32M
```

That sets the packet size to 32MB.

The server's default
[`max_allowed_packet`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_max_allowed_packet) value is
64MB. You can increase this if the server needs to handle big
queries (for example, if you are working with big
[`BLOB`](blob.md "13.3.4 The BLOB and TEXT Types") columns). For example, to
set the variable to 128MB, start the server like this:

```terminal
$> mysqld --max_allowed_packet=128M
```

You can also use an option file to set
[`max_allowed_packet`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_max_allowed_packet). For
example, to set the size for the server to 128MB, add the
following lines in an option file:

```ini
[mysqld]
max_allowed_packet=128M
```

It is safe to increase the value of this variable because the
extra memory is allocated only when needed. For example,
[**mysqld**](mysqld.md "6.3.1 mysqld — The MySQL Server") allocates more memory only when you
issue a long query or when [**mysqld**](mysqld.md "6.3.1 mysqld — The MySQL Server") must
return a large result row. The small default value of the
variable is a precaution to catch incorrect packets between
the client and server and also to ensure that you do not run
out of memory by using large packets accidentally.

You can also get strange problems with large packets if you
are using large [`BLOB`](blob.md "13.3.4 The BLOB and TEXT Types") values but
have not given [**mysqld**](mysqld.md "6.3.1 mysqld — The MySQL Server") access to enough
memory to handle the query. If you suspect this is the case,
try adding **ulimit -d 256000** to the
beginning of the [**mysqld\_safe**](mysqld-safe.md "6.3.2 mysqld_safe — MySQL Server Startup Script") script and
restarting [**mysqld**](mysqld.md "6.3.1 mysqld — The MySQL Server").
