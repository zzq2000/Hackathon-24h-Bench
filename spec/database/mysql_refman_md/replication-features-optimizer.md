#### 19.5.1.23 Replication and the Query Optimizer

It is possible for the data on the source and replica to become
different if a statement is written in such a way that the data
modification is nondeterministic; that is, left up the query
optimizer. (In general, this is not a good practice, even
outside of replication.) Examples of nondeterministic statements
include [`DELETE`](delete.md "15.2.2 DELETE Statement") or
[`UPDATE`](update.md "15.2.17 UPDATE Statement") statements that use
`LIMIT` with no `ORDER BY`
clause; see [Section 19.5.1.18, “Replication and LIMIT”](replication-features-limit.md "19.5.1.18 Replication and LIMIT"), for a
detailed discussion of these.
