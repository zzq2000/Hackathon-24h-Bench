#### 19.2.1.2 Usage of Row-Based Logging and Replication

MySQL uses statement-based logging (SBL), row-based logging
(RBL) or mixed-format logging. The type of binary log used
impacts the size and efficiency of logging. Therefore the choice
between row-based replication (RBR) or statement-based
replication (SBR) depends on your application and environment.
This section describes known issues when using a row-based
format log, and describes some best practices using it in
replication.

For additional information, see
[Section 19.2.1, “Replication Formats”](replication-formats.md "19.2.1 Replication Formats"), and
[Section 19.2.1.1, “Advantages and Disadvantages of Statement-Based and Row-Based
Replication”](replication-sbr-rbr.md "19.2.1.1 Advantages and Disadvantages of Statement-Based and Row-Based Replication").

For information about issues specific to NDB Cluster Replication
(which depends on row-based replication), see
[Section 25.7.3, “Known Issues in NDB Cluster Replication”](mysql-cluster-replication-issues.md "25.7.3 Known Issues in NDB Cluster Replication").

- **Row-based logging of temporary tables.**
  As noted in
  [Section 19.5.1.31, “Replication and Temporary Tables”](replication-features-temptables.md "19.5.1.31 Replication and Temporary Tables"),
  temporary tables are not replicated when using row-based
  format or (from MySQL 8.0.4) mixed format. For more
  information, see [Section 19.2.1.1, “Advantages and Disadvantages of Statement-Based and Row-Based
  Replication”](replication-sbr-rbr.md "19.2.1.1 Advantages and Disadvantages of Statement-Based and Row-Based Replication").

  Temporary tables are not replicated when using row-based or
  mixed format because there is no need. In addition, because
  temporary tables can be read only from the thread which
  created them, there is seldom if ever any benefit obtained
  from replicating them, even when using statement-based
  format.

  You can switch from statement-based to row-based binary
  logging format at runtime even when temporary tables have
  been created. However, in MySQL 8.0, you cannot switch from
  row-based or mixed format for binary logging to
  statement-based format at runtime, due to any
  `CREATE TEMPORARY TABLE` statements having
  been omitted from the binary log in the previous mode.

  The MySQL server tracks the logging mode that was in effect
  when each temporary table was created. When a given client
  session ends, the server logs a `DROP TEMPORARY
  TABLE IF EXISTS` statement for each temporary table
  that still exists and was created when statement-based
  binary logging was in use. If row-based or mixed format
  binary logging was in use when the table was created, the
  `DROP TEMPORARY TABLE IF EXISTS` statement
  is not logged. In releases before MySQL 8.0.4 and 5.7.25,
  the `DROP TEMPORARY TABLE IF EXISTS`
  statement was logged regardless of the logging mode that was
  in effect.

  Nontransactional DML statements involving temporary tables
  are allowed when using
  [`binlog_format=ROW`](replication-options-binary-log.md#sysvar_binlog_format), as long
  as any nontransactional tables affected by the statements
  are temporary tables (Bug #14272672).
- **RBL and synchronization of nontransactional tables.**
  When many rows are affected, the set of changes is split
  into several events; when the statement commits, all of
  these events are written to the binary log. When executing
  on the replica, a table lock is taken on all tables
  involved, and then the rows are applied in batch mode.
  Depending on the engine used for the replica's copy of the
  table, this may or may not be effective.
- **Latency and binary log size.**
  RBL writes changes for each row to the binary log and so
  its size can increase quite rapidly. This can
  significantly increase the time required to make changes
  on the replica that match those on the source. You should
  be aware of the potential for this delay in your
  applications.
- **Reading the binary log.**
  [**mysqlbinlog**](mysqlbinlog.md "6.6.9 mysqlbinlog — Utility for Processing Binary Log Files") displays row-based events
  in the binary log using the
  [`BINLOG`](binlog.md "15.7.8.1 BINLOG Statement") statement. This
  statement displays an event as a base 64-encoded string,
  the meaning of which is not evident. When invoked with the
  [`--base64-output=DECODE-ROWS`](mysqlbinlog.md#option_mysqlbinlog_base64-output)
  and [`--verbose`](mysqlbinlog.md#option_mysqlbinlog_verbose) options,
  [**mysqlbinlog**](mysqlbinlog.md "6.6.9 mysqlbinlog — Utility for Processing Binary Log Files") formats the contents of the
  binary log to be human readable. When binary log events
  were written in row-based format and you want to read or
  recover from a replication or database failure you can use
  this command to read contents of the binary log. For more
  information, see [Section 6.6.9.2, “mysqlbinlog Row Event Display”](mysqlbinlog-row-events.md "6.6.9.2 mysqlbinlog Row Event Display").
- **Binary log execution errors and replica execution mode.**
  Using
  [`slave_exec_mode=IDEMPOTENT`](replication-options-replica.md#sysvar_slave_exec_mode)
  is generally only useful with MySQL NDB Cluster
  replication, for which `IDEMPOTENT` is
  the default value. (See
  [Section 25.7.10, “NDB Cluster Replication: Bidirectional and Circular Replication”](mysql-cluster-replication-multi-source.md "25.7.10 NDB Cluster Replication: Bidirectional and Circular Replication")).
  When the system variable
  [`replica_exec_mode`](replication-options-replica.md#sysvar_replica_exec_mode) or
  [`slave_exec_mode`](replication-options-replica.md#sysvar_slave_exec_mode) is
  `IDEMPOTENT`, a failure to apply changes
  from RBL because the original row cannot be found does not
  trigger an error or cause replication to fail. This means
  that it is possible that updates are not applied on the
  replica, so that the source and replica are no longer
  synchronized. Latency issues and use of nontransactional
  tables with RBR when
  [`replica_exec_mode`](replication-options-replica.md#sysvar_replica_exec_mode) or
  [`slave_exec_mode`](replication-options-replica.md#sysvar_slave_exec_mode) is
  `IDEMPOTENT` can cause the source and
  replica to diverge even further. For more information
  about [`replica_exec_mode`](replication-options-replica.md#sysvar_replica_exec_mode)
  and [`slave_exec_mode`](replication-options-replica.md#sysvar_slave_exec_mode), see
  [Section 7.1.8, “Server System Variables”](server-system-variables.md "7.1.8 Server System Variables").

  For other scenarios, setting
  [`replica_exec_mode`](replication-options-replica.md#sysvar_replica_exec_mode) or
  [`slave_exec_mode`](replication-options-replica.md#sysvar_slave_exec_mode) to
  `STRICT` is normally sufficient; this is
  the default value for storage engines other than
  [`NDB`](mysql-cluster.md "Chapter 25 MySQL NDB Cluster 8.0").
- **Filtering based on server ID not supported.**
  You can filter based on server ID by using the
  `IGNORE_SERVER_IDS` option for the
  [`CHANGE REPLICATION SOURCE
  TO`](change-replication-source-to.md "15.4.2.3 CHANGE REPLICATION SOURCE TO Statement") statement (from MySQL 8.0.23) or
  [`CHANGE MASTER TO`](change-master-to.md "15.4.2.1 CHANGE MASTER TO Statement") statement
  (before MySQL 8.0.23). This option works with
  statement-based and row-based logging formats, but is
  deprecated for use when
  [`GTID_MODE=ON`](replication-options-gtids.md#sysvar_gtid_mode) is set.
  Another method to filter out changes on some replicas is
  to use a `WHERE` clause that includes the
  relation `@@server_id <>
  id_value` clause with
  [`UPDATE`](update.md "15.2.17 UPDATE Statement") and
  [`DELETE`](delete.md "15.2.2 DELETE Statement") statements. For
  example, `WHERE @@server_id <> 1`.
  However, this does not work correctly with row-based
  logging. To use the
  [`server_id`](replication-options.md#sysvar_server_id) system variable
  for statement filtering, use statement-based logging.
- **RBL, nontransactional tables, and stopped replicas.**
  When using row-based logging, if the replica server is
  stopped while a replica thread is updating a
  nontransactional table, the replica database can reach an
  inconsistent state. For this reason, it is recommended
  that you use a transactional storage engine such as
  [`InnoDB`](innodb-storage-engine.md "Chapter 17 The InnoDB Storage Engine") for all tables
  replicated using the row-based format. Use of
  [`STOP REPLICA`](stop-replica.md "15.4.2.8 STOP REPLICA Statement") or
  [`STOP REPLICA
  SQL_THREAD`](stop-replica.md "15.4.2.8 STOP REPLICA Statement") (prior to MySQL 8.0.22, use
  [`STOP slave`](stop-slave.md "15.4.2.9 STOP SLAVE Statement") or
  [`STOP SLAVE
  SQL_THREAD`](stop-slave.md "15.4.2.9 STOP SLAVE Statement")) prior to shutting down the replica
  MySQL server helps prevent issues from occurring, and is
  always recommended regardless of the logging format or
  storage engine you use.
