### 10.4.4 Internal Temporary Table Use in MySQL

In some cases, the server creates internal temporary tables
while processing statements. Users have no direct control over
when this occurs.

The server creates temporary tables under conditions such as
these:

- Evaluation of [`UNION`](union.md "15.2.18 UNION Clause")
  statements, with some exceptions described later.
- Evaluation of some views, such those that use the
  `TEMPTABLE` algorithm,
  [`UNION`](union.md "15.2.18 UNION Clause"), or aggregation.
- Evaluation of derived tables (see
  [Section 15.2.15.8, “Derived Tables”](derived-tables.md "15.2.15.8 Derived Tables")).
- Evaluation of common table expressions (see
  [Section 15.2.20, “WITH (Common Table Expressions)”](with.md "15.2.20 WITH (Common Table Expressions)")).
- Tables created for subquery or semijoin materialization (see
  [Section 10.2.2, “Optimizing Subqueries, Derived Tables, View References, and Common Table
  Expressions”](subquery-optimization.md "10.2.2 Optimizing Subqueries, Derived Tables, View References, and Common Table Expressions")).
- Evaluation of statements that contain an `ORDER
  BY` clause and a different `GROUP
  BY` clause, or for which the `ORDER
  BY` or `GROUP BY` contains columns
  from tables other than the first table in the join queue.
- Evaluation of `DISTINCT` combined with
  `ORDER BY` may require a temporary table.
- For queries that use the `SQL_SMALL_RESULT`
  modifier, MySQL uses an in-memory temporary table, unless
  the query also contains elements (described later) that
  require on-disk storage.
- To evaluate
  [`INSERT ...
  SELECT`](insert-select.md "15.2.7.1 INSERT ... SELECT Statement") statements that select from and insert into
  the same table, MySQL creates an internal temporary table to
  hold the rows from the
  [`SELECT`](select.md "15.2.13 SELECT Statement"), then inserts those
  rows into the target table. See
  [Section 15.2.7.1, “INSERT ... SELECT Statement”](insert-select.md "15.2.7.1 INSERT ... SELECT Statement").
- Evaluation of multiple-table
  [`UPDATE`](update.md "15.2.17 UPDATE Statement") statements.
- Evaluation of [`GROUP_CONCAT()`](aggregate-functions.md#function_group-concat)
  or [`COUNT(DISTINCT)`](aggregate-functions.md#function_count)
  expressions.
- Evaluation of window functions (see
  [Section 14.20, “Window Functions”](window-functions.md "14.20 Window Functions")) uses temporary tables as
  necessary.

To determine whether a statement requires a temporary table, use
[`EXPLAIN`](explain.md "15.8.2 EXPLAIN Statement") and check the
`Extra` column to see whether it says
`Using temporary` (see
[Section 10.8.1, “Optimizing Queries with EXPLAIN”](using-explain.md "10.8.1 Optimizing Queries with EXPLAIN")). `EXPLAIN`
does not necessarily say `Using temporary` for
derived or materialized temporary tables. For statements that
use window functions, [`EXPLAIN`](explain.md "15.8.2 EXPLAIN Statement")
with `FORMAT=JSON` always provides information
about the windowing steps. If the windowing functions use
temporary tables, it is indicated for each step.

Some query conditions prevent the use of an in-memory temporary
table, in which case the server uses an on-disk table instead:

- Presence of a [`BLOB`](blob.md "13.3.4 The BLOB and TEXT Types") or
  [`TEXT`](blob.md "13.3.4 The BLOB and TEXT Types") column in the table.
  However, the `TempTable` storage engine,
  which is the default storage engine for in-memory internal
  temporary tables in MySQL 8.0, supports binary
  large object types as of MySQL 8.0.13. See
  [Internal Temporary Table Storage Engine](internal-temporary-tables.md#internal-temporary-tables-engines "Internal Temporary Table Storage Engine").
- Presence of any string column with a maximum length larger
  than 512 (bytes for binary strings, characters for nonbinary
  strings) in the [`SELECT`](select.md "15.2.13 SELECT Statement") list,
  if [`UNION`](union.md "15.2.18 UNION Clause") or
  [`UNION ALL`](union.md "15.2.18 UNION Clause")
  is used.
- The [`SHOW COLUMNS`](show-columns.md "15.7.7.5 SHOW COLUMNS Statement") and
  [`DESCRIBE`](describe.md "15.8.1 DESCRIBE Statement") statements use
  `BLOB` as the type for some columns, thus
  the temporary table used for the results is an on-disk
  table.

The server does not use a temporary table for
[`UNION`](union.md "15.2.18 UNION Clause") statements that meet
certain qualifications. Instead, it retains from temporary table
creation only the data structures necessary to perform result
column typecasting. The table is not fully instantiated and no
rows are written to or read from it; rows are sent directly to
the client. The result is reduced memory and disk requirements,
and smaller delay before the first row is sent to the client
because the server need not wait until the last query block is
executed. [`EXPLAIN`](explain.md "15.8.2 EXPLAIN Statement") and optimizer
trace output reflects this execution strategy: The
`UNION RESULT` query block is not present
because that block corresponds to the part that reads from the
temporary table.

These conditions qualify a `UNION` for
evaluation without a temporary table:

- The union is `UNION ALL`, not
  `UNION` or `UNION
  DISTINCT`.
- There is no global `ORDER BY` clause.
- The union is not the top-level query block of an
  `{INSERT | REPLACE} ... SELECT ...`
  statement.

#### Internal Temporary Table Storage Engine

An internal temporary table can be held in memory and
processed by the `TempTable` or
`MEMORY` storage engine, or stored on disk by
the `InnoDB` storage engine.

##### Storage Engine for In-Memory Internal Temporary Tables

The
[`internal_tmp_mem_storage_engine`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_internal_tmp_mem_storage_engine)
variable defines the storage engine used for in-memory
internal temporary tables. Permitted values are
`TempTable` (the default) and
`MEMORY`.

Note

As of MySQL 8.0.27, configuring a session setting for
[`internal_tmp_mem_storage_engine`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_internal_tmp_mem_storage_engine)
requires the
[`SESSION_VARIABLES_ADMIN`](privileges-provided.md#priv_session-variables-admin) or
[`SYSTEM_VARIABLES_ADMIN`](privileges-provided.md#priv_system-variables-admin)
privilege.

The `TempTable` storage engine provides
efficient storage for [`VARCHAR`](char.md "13.3.2 The CHAR and VARCHAR Types")
and [`VARBINARY`](binary-varbinary.md "13.3.3 The BINARY and VARBINARY Types") columns, and
other binary large object types as of MySQL 8.0.13.

The following variables control TempTable storage engine
limits and behavior:

- [`tmp_table_size`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_tmp_table_size): From
  MySQL 8.0.28,
  [`tmp_table_size`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_tmp_table_size) defines
  the maximum size of any individual in-memory internal
  temporary table created by the TempTable storage engine.
  When the [`tmp_table_size`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_tmp_table_size)
  limit is reached, MySQL automatically converts the
  in-memory internal temporary table to an
  `InnoDB` on-disk internal temporary
  table. The default
  [`tmp_table_size`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_tmp_table_size) setting is
  16777216 bytes (16 MiB).

  The [`tmp_table_size`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_tmp_table_size) limit
  is intended to prevent individual queries from consuming
  an inordinate amount global TempTable resources, which can
  affect the performance of concurrent queries that require
  TempTable resources. Global TempTable resources are
  controlled by the
  [`temptable_max_ram`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_temptable_max_ram) and
  [`temptable_max_mmap`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_temptable_max_mmap)
  settings.

  If the [`tmp_table_size`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_tmp_table_size)
  limit is less than the
  [`temptable_max_ram`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_temptable_max_ram) limit,
  it is not possible for an in-memory temporary table to
  contain more data than permitted by the
  [`tmp_table_size`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_tmp_table_size) limit. If
  the [`tmp_table_size`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_tmp_table_size) limit
  is greater than the sum of the
  [`temptable_max_ram`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_temptable_max_ram) and
  [`temptable_max_mmap`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_temptable_max_mmap)
  limits, it is not possible for an in-memory temporary
  table to contain more than the sum of the
  [`temptable_max_ram`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_temptable_max_ram) and
  [`temptable_max_mmap`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_temptable_max_mmap)
  limits.
- [`temptable_max_ram`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_temptable_max_ram):
  Defines the maximum amount of RAM that can be used by the
  `TempTable` storage engine before it
  starts allocating space from memory-mapped files or before
  MySQL starts using `InnoDB` on-disk
  internal temporary tables, depending on your
  configuration. The default
  [`temptable_max_ram`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_temptable_max_ram) setting
  is 1073741824 bytes (1GiB).

  Note

  The [`temptable_max_ram`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_temptable_max_ram)
  setting does not account for the thread-local memory
  block allocated to each thread that uses the
  `TempTable` storage engine. The size of
  the thread-local memory block depends on the size of the
  thread's first memory allocation request. If the
  request is less than 1MB, which it is in most cases, the
  thread-local memory block size is 1MB. If the request is
  greater than 1MB, the thread-local memory block is
  approximately the same size as the initial memory
  request. The thread-local memory block is held in
  thread-local storage until thread exit.
- [`temptable_use_mmap`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_temptable_use_mmap):
  Controls whether the `TempTable` storage
  engine allocates space from memory-mapped files or MySQL
  uses `InnoDB` on-disk internal temporary
  tables when the
  [`temptable_max_ram`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_temptable_max_ram) limit
  is exceeded. The default setting is
  [`temptable_use_mmap=ON`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_temptable_use_mmap).

  Note

  The [`temptable_use_mmap`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_temptable_use_mmap)
  variable was introduced in MySQL 8.0.16 and deprecated
  in MySQL 8.0.26; expect support for it to be removed in
  a future version of MySQL. Setting
  [`temptable_max_mmap=0`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_temptable_max_mmap) is
  equivalent to setting
  [`temptable_use_mmap=OFF`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_temptable_use_mmap).
- [`temptable_max_mmap`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_temptable_max_mmap):
  Introduced in MySQL 8.0.23. Defines the maximum amount of
  memory the TempTable storage engine is permitted to
  allocate from memory-mapped files before MySQL starts
  using `InnoDB` on-disk internal temporary
  tables. The default setting is 1073741824 bytes (1GiB).
  The limit is intended to address the risk of memory mapped
  files using too much space in the temporary directory
  ([`tmpdir`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_tmpdir)). A
  [`temptable_max_mmap=0`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_temptable_max_mmap)
  setting disables allocation from memory-mapped files,
  effectively disabling their use, regardless of the
  [`temptable_use_mmap`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_temptable_use_mmap)
  setting.

Use of memory-mapped files by the `TempTable`
storage engine is governed by these rules:

- Temporary files are created in the directory defined by
  the [`tmpdir`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_tmpdir) variable.
- Temporary files are deleted immediately after they are
  created and opened, and therefore do not remain visible in
  the [`tmpdir`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_tmpdir) directory. The
  space occupied by temporary files is held by the operating
  system while temporary files are open. The space is
  reclaimed when temporary files are closed by the
  `TempTable` storage engine, or when the
  `mysqld` process is shut down.
- Data is never moved between RAM and temporary files,
  within RAM, or between temporary files.
- New data is stored in RAM if space becomes available
  within the limit defined by
  [`temptable_max_ram`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_temptable_max_ram).
  Otherwise, new data is stored in temporary files.
- If space becomes available in RAM after some of the data
  for a table is written to temporary files, it is possible
  for the remaining table data to be stored in RAM.

When using the `MEMORY` storage engine for
in-memory temporary tables
([`internal_tmp_mem_storage_engine=MEMORY`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_internal_tmp_mem_storage_engine)),
MySQL automatically converts an in-memory temporary table to
an on-disk table if it becomes too large. The maximum size of
an in-memory temporary table is defined by the
[`tmp_table_size`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_tmp_table_size) or
[`max_heap_table_size`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_max_heap_table_size) value,
whichever is smaller. This differs from
`MEMORY` tables explicitly created with
[`CREATE TABLE`](create-table.md "15.1.20 CREATE TABLE Statement"). For such tables,
only the [`max_heap_table_size`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_max_heap_table_size)
variable determines how large a table can grow, and there is
no conversion to on-disk format.

##### Storage Engine for On-Disk Internal Temporary Tables

In MySQL 8.0.15 and earlier, the
[`internal_tmp_disk_storage_engine`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_internal_tmp_disk_storage_engine)
variable defined the storage engine used for on-disk internal
temporary tables. Supported storage engines were
`InnoDB` and `MyISAM`.

From MySQL 8.0.16, MySQL uses only the
`InnoDB` storage engine for on-disk internal
temporary tables. The `MYISAM` storage engine
is no longer supported for this purpose.

`InnoDB` on-disk internal temporary tables
are created in session temporary tablespaces that reside in
the data directory by default. For more information, see
[Section 17.6.3.5, “Temporary Tablespaces”](innodb-temporary-tablespace.md "17.6.3.5 Temporary Tablespaces").

In MySQL 8.0.15 and earlier:

- For common table expressions (CTEs), the storage engine
  used for on-disk internal temporary tables cannot be
  `MyISAM`. If
  [`internal_tmp_disk_storage_engine=MYISAM`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_internal_tmp_disk_storage_engine),
  an error occurs for any attempt to materialize a CTE using
  an on-disk temporary table.
- When using
  [`internal_tmp_disk_storage_engine=INNODB`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_internal_tmp_disk_storage_engine),
  queries that generate on-disk internal temporary tables
  that exceed `InnoDB` row or column limits
  return Row size too large or
  Too many columns errors. The
  workaround is to set
  [`internal_tmp_disk_storage_engine`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_internal_tmp_disk_storage_engine)
  to `MYISAM`.

#### Internal Temporary Table Storage Format

When in-memory internal temporary tables are managed by the
`TempTable` storage engine, rows that include
`VARCHAR` columns,
`VARBINARY` columns, and other binary large
object type columns (supported as of MySQL 8.0.13) are
represented in memory by an array of cells, with each cell
containing a NULL flag, the data length, and a data pointer.
Column values are placed in consecutive order after the array,
in a single region of memory, without padding. Each cell in
the array uses 16 bytes of storage. The same storage format
applies when the `TempTable` storage engine
allocates space from memory-mapped files.

When in-memory internal temporary tables are managed by the
`MEMORY` storage engine, fixed-length row
format is used. `VARCHAR` and
`VARBINARY` column values are padded to the
maximum column length, in effect storing them as
`CHAR` and `BINARY` columns.

Prior to MySQL 8.0.16, on-disk internal temporary tables were
managed by the `InnoDB` or
`MyISAM` storage engine (depending on the
[`internal_tmp_disk_storage_engine`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_internal_tmp_disk_storage_engine)
setting). Both engines store internal temporary tables using
dynamic-width row format. Columns take only as much storage as
needed, which reduces disk I/O, space requirements, and
processing time compared to on-disk tables that use
fixed-length rows. Beginning with MySQL 8.0.16,
[`internal_tmp_disk_storage_engine`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_internal_tmp_disk_storage_engine)
is not supported, and internal temporary tables on disk are
always managed by `InnoDB`.

When using the `MEMORY` storage engine,
statements can initially create an in-memory internal
temporary table and then convert it to an on-disk table if the
table becomes too large. In such cases, better performance
might be achieved by skipping the conversion and creating the
internal temporary table on disk to begin with. The
[`big_tables`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_big_tables) variable can be
used to force disk storage of internal temporary tables.

#### Monitoring Internal Temporary Table Creation

When an internal temporary table is created in memory or on
disk, the server increments the
[`Created_tmp_tables`](server-status-variables.md#statvar_Created_tmp_tables) value.
When an internal temporary table is created on disk, the
server increments the
[`Created_tmp_disk_tables`](server-status-variables.md#statvar_Created_tmp_disk_tables)
value. If too many internal temporary tables are created on
disk, consider adjusting the engine-specific limits described
in [Internal Temporary Table Storage Engine](internal-temporary-tables.md#internal-temporary-tables-engines "Internal Temporary Table Storage Engine").

Note

Due to a known limitation,
[`Created_tmp_disk_tables`](server-status-variables.md#statvar_Created_tmp_disk_tables)
does not count on-disk temporary tables created in
memory-mapped files. By default, the TempTable storage
engine overflow mechanism creates internal temporary tables
in memory-mapped files. See
[Internal Temporary Table Storage Engine](internal-temporary-tables.md#internal-temporary-tables-engines "Internal Temporary Table Storage Engine").

The `memory/temptable/physical_ram` and
`memory/temptable/physical_disk` Performance
Schema instruments can be used to monitor
`TempTable` space allocation from memory and
disk. `memory/temptable/physical_ram` reports
the amount of allocated RAM.
`memory/temptable/physical_disk` reports the
amount of space allocated from disk when memory-mapped files
are used as the TempTable overflow mechanism. If the
`physical_disk` instrument reports a value
other than 0 and memory-mapped files are used as the TempTable
overflow mechanism, a TempTable memory limit was reached at
some point. Data can be queried in Performance Schema memory
summary tables such as
[`memory_summary_global_by_event_name`](performance-schema-memory-summary-tables.md "29.12.20.10 Memory Summary Tables").
See
[Section 29.12.20.10, “Memory Summary Tables”](performance-schema-memory-summary-tables.md "29.12.20.10 Memory Summary Tables").
