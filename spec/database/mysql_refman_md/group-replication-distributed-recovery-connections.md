#### 20.5.4.1 Connections for Distributed Recovery

When a joining member connects to an online existing member for
state transfer during distributed recovery, the joining member
acts as a client on the connection and the existing member acts
as a server. When state transfer from the donor's binary log is
in progress over this connection (using the asynchronous
replication channel
`group_replication_recovery`), the joining
member acts as the replica and the existing member acts as the
source. When a remote cloning operation is in progress over this
connection, the joining member acts as a recipient and the
existing member acts as a donor. Configuration settings that
apply to those roles outside the Group Replication context can
apply for Group Replication also, unless they are overridden by
a Group Replication-specific configuration setting or behavior.

The connection that an existing member offers to a joining
member for distributed recovery is not the same connection that
is used by Group Replication for communication between online
members of the group.

- The connection used by the group communication engine for
  Group Replication (XCom, a Paxos variant) for TCP
  communication between remote XCom instances is specified by
  the
  [`group_replication_local_address`](group-replication-system-variables.md#sysvar_group_replication_local_address)
  system variable. This connection is used for TCP/IP messages
  between online members. Communication with the local
  instance is over an input channel using shared memory.
- For distributed recovery prior to MySQL 8.0.21, group
  members offer their standard SQL client connection to
  joining members, as specified by
  [`hostname`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_hostname) and
  [`port`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_port). If an alternative
  port number is specified by
  [`report_port`](replication-options-replica.md#sysvar_report_port), that one is
  used instead.
- In MySQL 8.0.21 and later, group members may advertise an
  alternative list of distributed recovery endpoints as
  dedicated client connections for joining members, allowing
  you to control distributed recovery traffic separately from
  connections by regular client users of the member. A member
  transmits the list of distributed recovery endpoints
  specified by
  [`group_replication_advertise_recovery_endpoints`](group-replication-system-variables.md#sysvar_group_replication_advertise_recovery_endpoints)
  to the group when it joins. By default, the member continues
  to offer the standard SQL client connection as in earlier
  releases.

Important

Distributed recovery can fail if a joining member cannot
correctly identify the other members using the host name as
defined by MySQL Server's
[`hostname`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_hostname) system variable. It
is recommended that operating systems running MySQL have a
properly configured unique host name, either using DNS or
local settings. The host name that the server is using for SQL
client connections can be verified in the
`Member_host` column of the Performance
Schema table
[`replication_group_members`](performance-schema-replication-group-members-table.md "29.12.11.16 The replication_group_members Table"). If
multiple group members externalize a default host name set by
the operating system, there is a chance of the joining member
not resolving it to the correct member address and not being
able to connect for distributed recovery. In this situation
you can use MySQL Server's
[`report_host`](replication-options-replica.md#sysvar_report_host) system variable
to configure a unique host name to be externalized by each of
the servers.

The steps for a joining member to establish a connection for
distributed recovery are as follows:

1. When the member joins the group, it connects with one of the
   seed members included in the list in its
   [`group_replication_group_seeds`](group-replication-system-variables.md#sysvar_group_replication_group_seeds)
   system variable, initially using the
   [`group_replication_local_address`](group-replication-system-variables.md#sysvar_group_replication_local_address)
   connection as specified in that list. The seed members might
   be a subset of the group.
2. Over this connection, the seed member uses Group
   Replication's membership service to provide the joining
   member with a list of all the members that are online in the
   group, in the form of a view. The membership information
   includes the details of the distributed recovery endpoints
   or standard SQL client connection offered by each member for
   distributed recovery.
3. The joining member selects a suitable group member from this
   list to be its donor for distributed recovery, following the
   behaviors described in
   [Section 20.5.4.4, “Fault Tolerance for Distributed Recovery”](group-replication-distributed-recovery-fault.md "20.5.4.4 Fault Tolerance for Distributed Recovery").
4. The joining member then attempts to connect to the donor
   using the donor's advertised distributed recovery endpoints,
   trying each in turn in the order they are specified in the
   list. If the donor provides no endpoints, the joining member
   attempts to connect using the donor's standard SQL client
   connection. The SSL requirements for the connection are as
   specified by the
   `group_replication_recovery_ssl_*` options
   described in
   [Section 20.5.4.1.4, “SSL and Authentication for Distributed Recovery”](group-replication-distributed-recovery-connections.md#group-replication-distributed-recovery-connections-ssl "20.5.4.1.4 SSL and Authentication for Distributed Recovery").
5. If the joining member is not able to connect to the selected
   donor, it retries with other suitable donors, following the
   behaviors described in
   [Section 20.5.4.4, “Fault Tolerance for Distributed Recovery”](group-replication-distributed-recovery-fault.md "20.5.4.4 Fault Tolerance for Distributed Recovery").
   Note that if the joining member exhausts the list of
   advertised endpoints without making a connection, it does
   not fall back to the donor's standard SQL client connection,
   but switches to another donor.
6. When the joining member establishes a distributed recovery
   connection with a donor, it uses that connection for state
   transfer as described in
   [Section 20.5.4, “Distributed Recovery”](group-replication-distributed-recovery.md "20.5.4 Distributed Recovery").
   The host and port for the connection that is used are shown
   in the joining member's log. Note that if a remote cloning
   operation is used, when the joining member has restarted at
   the end of the operation, it establishes a connection with a
   new donor for state transfer from the binary log. This might
   be a connection to a different member from the original
   donor used for the remote cloning operation, or it might be
   a different connection to the original donor. In any case,
   the distributed recovery process continues in the same way
   as it would have with the original donor.

##### 20.5.4.1.1 Selecting addresses for distributed recovery endpoints

IP addresses supplied by the
[`group_replication_advertise_recovery_endpoints`](group-replication-system-variables.md#sysvar_group_replication_advertise_recovery_endpoints)
system variable as distributed recovery endpoints do not have
to be configured for MySQL Server (that is, they do not have
to be specified by the
[`admin_address`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_admin_address) system variable
or in the list for the
[`bind_address`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_bind_address) system
variable). They do have to be assigned to the server. Any host
names used must resolve to a local IP address. IPv4 and IPv6
addresses can be used.

The ports supplied for the distributed recovery endpoints do
have to be configured for MySQL Server, so they must be
specified by the [`port`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_port),
[`report_port`](replication-options-replica.md#sysvar_report_port), or
[`admin_port`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_admin_port) system variable.
The server must listen for TCP/IP connections on these ports.
If you specify the
[`admin_port`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_admin_port), the replication
user for distributed recovery needs the
[`SERVICE_CONNECTION_ADMIN`](privileges-provided.md#priv_service-connection-admin)
privilege to connect. Selecting the
[`admin_port`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_admin_port) keeps distributed
recovery connections separate from regular MySQL client
connections.

Joining members try each of the endpoints in turn in the order
they are specified on the list. If
[`group_replication_advertise_recovery_endpoints`](group-replication-system-variables.md#sysvar_group_replication_advertise_recovery_endpoints)
is set to `DEFAULT` rather than a list of
endpoints, the standard SQL client connection is offered. Note
that the standard SQL client connection is not automatically
included on a list of distributed recovery endpoints, and is
not offered as a fallback if the donor's list of endpoints is
exhausted without a connection. If you want to offer the
standard SQL client connection as one of a number of
distributed recovery endpoints, you must include it explicitly
in the list specified by
[`group_replication_advertise_recovery_endpoints`](group-replication-system-variables.md#sysvar_group_replication_advertise_recovery_endpoints).
You can put it in the last place so that it acts as a last
resort for connection.

A group member's distributed recovery endpoints (or standard
SQL client connection if endpoints are not provided) do not
need to be added to the Group Replication allowlist specified
by the
[`group_replication_ip_allowlist`](group-replication-system-variables.md#sysvar_group_replication_ip_allowlist)
(from MySQL 8.0.22) or
[`group_replication_ip_whitelist`](group-replication-system-variables.md#sysvar_group_replication_ip_whitelist)
system variable. The allowlist is only for the address
specified by
[`group_replication_local_address`](group-replication-system-variables.md#sysvar_group_replication_local_address)
for each member. A joining member must have its initial
connection to the group permitted by the allowlist in order to
retrieve the address or addresses for distributed recovery.

The distributed recovery endpoints that you list are validated
when the system variable is set and when a
[`START GROUP_REPLICATION`](start-group-replication.md "15.4.3.1 START GROUP_REPLICATION Statement")
statement has been issued. If the list cannot be parsed
correctly, or if any of the endpoints cannot be accessed on
the host because the server is not listening on them, Group
Replication logs an error and does not start.

##### 20.5.4.1.2 Compression for Distributed Recovery

In MySQL 8.0.18 and later, you can optionally configure
compression for distributed recovery by the method of state
transfer from a donor's binary log. Compression can
benefit distributed recovery where network bandwidth is
limited and the donor has to transfer many transactions to the
joining member. The
[`group_replication_recovery_compression_algorithms`](group-replication-system-variables.md#sysvar_group_replication_recovery_compression_algorithms)
and
[`group_replication_recovery_zstd_compression_level`](group-replication-system-variables.md#sysvar_group_replication_recovery_zstd_compression_level)
system variables determine permitted compression algorithms,
and the `zstd` compression level used when
carrying out state transfer from a donor's binary log.
For more information, see
[Section 6.2.8, “Connection Compression Control”](connection-compression-control.md "6.2.8 Connection Compression Control").

These compression settings do not apply to remote cloning
operations. When a remote cloning operation is used for
distributed recovery, the clone plugin's setting for
[`clone_enable_compression`](clone-plugin-options-variables.md#sysvar_clone_enable_compression)
applies.

##### 20.5.4.1.3 Replication User for Distributed Recovery

Distributed recovery requires a replication user that has the
correct permissions so that Group Replication can establish
direct member-to-member replication channels. The replication
user must also have the correct permissions to act as the
clone user on the donor for a remote cloning operation. The
same replication user must be used for distributed recovery on
every group member. For instructions to set up this
replication user, see
[Section 20.2.1.3, “User Credentials For Distributed Recovery”](group-replication-user-credentials.md "20.2.1.3 User Credentials For Distributed Recovery"). For
instructions to secure the replication user credentials, see
[Section 20.6.3.1, “Secure User Credentials for Distributed Recovery”](group-replication-secure-user.md "20.6.3.1 Secure User Credentials for Distributed Recovery").

##### 20.5.4.1.4 SSL and Authentication for Distributed Recovery

SSL for distributed recovery is configured separately from SSL
for normal group communications, which is determined by the
server's SSL settings and the
[`group_replication_ssl_mode`](group-replication-system-variables.md#sysvar_group_replication_ssl_mode)
system variable. For distributed recovery connections,
dedicated Group Replication distributed recovery SSL system
variables are available to configure the use of certificates
and ciphers specifically for distributed recovery.

By default, SSL is not used for distributed recovery
connections. To activate it, set
[`group_replication_recovery_use_ssl=ON`](group-replication-system-variables.md#sysvar_group_replication_recovery_use_ssl),
and configure the Group Replication distributed recovery SSL
system variables as described in
[Section 20.6.3, “Securing Distributed Recovery Connections”](group-replication-distributed-recovery-securing.md "20.6.3 Securing Distributed Recovery Connections").
You need a replication user that is set up to use SSL.

When distributed recovery is configured to use SSL, Group
Replication applies this setting for remote cloning
operations, as well as for state transfer from a donor's
binary log. Group Replication automatically configures the
settings for the clone SSL options
([`clone_ssl_ca`](clone-plugin-options-variables.md#sysvar_clone_ssl_ca),
[`clone_ssl_cert`](clone-plugin-options-variables.md#sysvar_clone_ssl_cert), and
[`clone_ssl_key`](clone-plugin-options-variables.md#sysvar_clone_ssl_key)) to match your
settings for the corresponding Group Replication distributed
recovery options
([`group_replication_recovery_ssl_ca`](group-replication-system-variables.md#sysvar_group_replication_recovery_ssl_ca),
[`group_replication_recovery_ssl_cert`](group-replication-system-variables.md#sysvar_group_replication_recovery_ssl_cert),
and
[`group_replication_recovery_ssl_key`](group-replication-system-variables.md#sysvar_group_replication_recovery_ssl_key)).

If you are not using SSL for distributed recovery (so
[`group_replication_recovery_use_ssl`](group-replication-system-variables.md#sysvar_group_replication_recovery_use_ssl)
is set to `OFF`), and the replication user
account for Group Replication authenticates with the
`caching_sha2_password` plugin (which is the
default in MySQL 8.0) or the
`sha256_password` plugin, RSA key-pairs are
used for password exchange. In this case, either use the
[`group_replication_recovery_public_key_path`](group-replication-system-variables.md#sysvar_group_replication_recovery_public_key_path)
system variable to specify the RSA public key file, or use the
[`group_replication_recovery_get_public_key`](group-replication-system-variables.md#sysvar_group_replication_recovery_get_public_key)
system variable to request the public key from the source, as
described in
[Section 20.6.3.1.1, “Replication User With The Caching SHA-2 Authentication Plugin”](group-replication-secure-user.md#group-replication-caching-sha2-user-credentials "20.6.3.1.1 Replication User With The Caching SHA-2 Authentication Plugin").
