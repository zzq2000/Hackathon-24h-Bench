Point-in-time recovery refers to recovery of data changes up to a
given point in time. Typically, this type of recovery is performed
after restoring a full backup that brings the server to its state
as of the time the backup was made. (The full backup can be made
in several ways, such as those listed in
[Section 9.2, “Database Backup Methods”](backup-methods.md "9.2 Database Backup Methods").) Point-in-time recovery then
brings the server up to date incrementally from the time of the
full backup to a more recent time.
