- [memory\_per\_fragment Table: Examples](mysql-cluster-ndbinfo-memory-per-fragment.md#mysql-cluster-ndbinfo-memory-per-fragment-examples "memory_per_fragment Table: Examples")

The `memory_per_fragment` table provides
information about the usage of memory by individual fragments.
See the
[Notes](mysql-cluster-ndbinfo-memory-per-fragment.md#mysql-cluster-ndbinfo-memory-per-fragment-notes "memory_per_fragment Table: Notes")
later in this section to see how you can use this to find out
how much memory is used by `NDB` tables.

The `memory_per_fragment` table contains the
following columns:

- `fq_name`

  Name of this fragment
- `parent_fq_name`

  Name of this fragment's parent
- `type`

  Dictionary object type
  ([`Object::Type`](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/ndbapi/en/ndb-object.html#ndb-object-type), in the NDB
  API) used for this fragment; one of `System
  table`, `User table`,
  `Unique hash index`, `Hash
  index`, `Unique ordered index`,
  `Ordered index`, `Hash index
  trigger`, `Subscription trigger`,
  `Read only constraint`, `Index
  trigger`, `Reorganize trigger`,
  `Tablespace`, `Log file
  group`, `Data file`, `Undo
  file`, `Hash map`,
  `Foreign key definition`, `Foreign
  key parent trigger`, `Foreign key child
  trigger`, or `Schema transaction`.

  You can also obtain this list by executing
  [`TABLE`](table.md "15.2.16 TABLE Statement")
  [`ndbinfo.dict_obj_types`](mysql-cluster-ndbinfo-dict-obj-types.md "25.6.16.26 The ndbinfo dict_obj_types Table") in
  the [**mysql**](mysql.md "6.5.1 mysql — The MySQL Command-Line Client") client.
- `table_id`

  Table ID for this table
- `node_id`

  Node ID for this node
- `block_instance`

  NDB kernel block instance ID; you can use this number to
  obtain information about specific threads from the

##### memory\_per\_fragment Table: Notes

The `memory_per_fragment` table contains one
row for every table fragment replica and every index fragment
replica in the system; this means that, for example, when
[`NoOfReplicas=2`](mysql-cluster-ndbd-definition.md#ndbparam-ndbd-noofreplicas), there
are normally two fragment replicas for each fragment. This is
true as long as all data nodes are running and connected to
the cluster; for a data node that is missing, there are no
rows for the fragment replicas that it hosts.

The columns of the `memory_per_fragment`
table can be grouped according to their function or purpose as
follows:

- *Key columns*:
  `fq_name`, `type`,
  `table_id`, `node_id`,
  `block_instance`, and
  `fragment_num`
- *Relationship column*:
  `parent_fq_name`
- *Fixed-size storage columns*:
  `fixed_elem_alloc_bytes`,
  `fixed_elem_free_bytes`,
  `fixed_elem_size_bytes`,
  `fixed_elem_count`, and
  `fixed_elem_free_count`
- *Variable-sized storage columns*:
  `var_elem_alloc_bytes`,
  `var_elem_free_bytes`, and
  `var_elem_count`
- *Hash index column*:
  `hash_index_alloc_bytes`

The `parent_fq_name` and
`fq_name` columns can be used to identify
indexes associated with a table. Similar schema object
hierarchy information is available in other
`ndbinfo` tables.

Table and index fragment replicas allocate
[`DataMemory`](mysql-cluster-ndbd-definition.md#ndbparam-ndbd-datamemory) in 32KB
pages. These memory pages are managed as listed here:

- *Fixed-size pages*: These store the
  fixed-size parts of rows stored in a given fragment. Every
  row has a fixed-size part.
- *Variable-sized pages*: These store
  variable-sized parts for rows in the fragment. Every row
  having one or more variable-sized, one or more dynamic
  columns (or both) has a variable-sized part.
- *Hash index pages*: These are allocated
  as 8 KB subpages, and store the primary key hash index
  structure.

Each row in an `NDB` table has a fixed-size
part, consisting of a row header, and one or more fixed-size
columns. The row may also contain one or more variable-size
part references, one or more disk part references, or both.
Each row also has a primary key hash index entry
(corresponding to the hidden primary key that is part of every
`NDB` table).

From the foregoing we can see that each table fragment and
index fragment together allocate the amount of
[`DataMemory`](mysql-cluster-ndbd-definition.md#ndbparam-ndbd-datamemory) calculated
as shown here:

```simple
DataMemory =
  (number_of_fixed_pages + number_of_var_pages) * 32KB
    + number_of_hash_pages * 8KB
```

Since `fixed_elem_alloc_bytes` and
`var_elem_alloc_bytes` are always multiples
of 32768 bytes, we can further determine that
`number_of_fixed_pages =
fixed_elem_alloc_bytes / 32768` and
`number_of_var_pages =
var_elem_alloc_bytes / 32768`.
`hash_index_alloc_bytes` is always a multiple
of 8192 bytes, so
`number_of_hash_pages =
hash_index_alloc_bytes / 8192`.

A fixed size page has an internal header and a number of
fixed-size slots, each of which can contain one row's
fixed-size part. The size of a given row's fixed size
part is schema-dependent, and is provided by the
`fixed_elem_size_bytes` column; the number of
fixed-size slots per page can be determined by calculating the
total number of slots and the total number of pages, like
this:

```simple
fixed_slots = fixed_elem_count + fixed_elem_free_count

fixed_pages = fixed_elem_alloc_bytes / 32768

slots_per_page = total_slots / total_pages
```

`fixed_elem_count` is in effect the row count
for a given table fragment, since each row has 1 fixed
element, `fixed_elem_free_count` is the total
number of free fixed-size slots across the allocated pages.
`fixed_elem_free_bytes` is equal to
`fixed_elem_free_count *
fixed_elem_size_bytes`.

A fragment can have any number of fixed-size pages; when the
last row on a fixed-size page is deleted, the page is released
to the `DataMemory` page pool. Fixed-size
pages can be fragmented, with more pages allocated than is
required by the number of fixed-size slots in use. You can
check whether this is the case by comparing the pages required
to the pages allocated, which you can calculate like this:

```simple
fixed_pages_required = 1 + (fixed_elem_count / slots_per_page)

fixed_page_utilization = fixed_pages_required / fixed_pages
```

A variable-sized page has an internal header and uses the
remaining space to store one or more variable-sized row parts;
the number of parts stored depends on the schema and the
actual data stored. Since not all schemas or rows have a
variable-sized part, `var_elem_count` can be
less than `fixed_elem_count`. The total free
space available on all variable-sized pages in the fragment is
shown by the `var_elem_free_bytes` column;
because this space may be spread over multiple pages, it
cannot necessarily be used to store an entry of a particular
size. Each variable-sized page is reorganized as needed to fit
the changing size of variable-sized row parts as they are
inserted, updated, and deleted; if a given row part grows too
large for the page it is in, it can be moved to a different
page.

Variable-sized page utilisation can be calculated as shown
here:

```simple
var_page_used_bytes =  var_elem_alloc_bytes - var_elem_free_bytes

var_page_utilisation = var_page_used_bytes / var_elem_alloc_bytes

avg_row_var_part_size = var_page_used_bytes / fixed_elem_count
```

We can obtain the average variable part size per row like
this:

```simple
avg_row_var_part_size = var_page_used_bytes / fixed_elem_count
```

Secondary unique indexes are implemented internally as
independent tables with the following schema:

- *Primary key*: Indexed columns in base
  table.
- *Values*: Primary key columns from base
  table.

These tables are distributed and fragmented as normal. This
means that their fragment replicas use fixed, variable, and
hash index pages as with any other `NDB`
table.

Secondary ordered indexes are fragmented and distributed in
the same way as the base table. Ordered index fragments are
T-tree structures which maintain a balanced tree containing
row references in the order implied by the indexed columns.
Since the tree contains references rather than actual data,
the T-tree storage cost is not dependent on the size or number
of indexed columns, but is rather a function of the number of
rows. The tree is constructed using fixed-size node
structures, each of which may contain a number of row
references; the number of nodes required depends on the number
of rows in the table, and the tree structure necessary to
represent the ordering. In the
`memory_per_fragment` table, we can see that
ordered indexes allocate only fixed-size pages, so as usual
the relevant columns from this table are as listed here:

- `fixed_elem_alloc_bytes`: This is equal
  to 32768 times the number of fixed-size pages.
- `fixed_elem_count`: The number of T-tree
  nodes in use.
- `fixed_elem_size_bytes`: The number of
  bytes per T-tree node.
- `fixed_elem_free_count`: The number of
  T-tree node slots available in the pages allocated.
- `fixed_elem_free_bytes`: This is equal to
  `fixed_elem_free_count *
  fixed_elem_size_bytes`.

If free space in a page is fragmented, the page is
defragmented. [`OPTIMIZE TABLE`](optimize-table.md "15.7.3.4 OPTIMIZE TABLE Statement")
can be used to defragment a table's variable-sized pages;
this moves row variable-sized parts between pages so that some
whole pages can be freed for re-use.

For the following examples, we create a simple table with
three integer columns, one of which has a primary key, one
having a unique index, and one with no indexes, as well as one
[`VARCHAR`](char.md "13.3.2 The CHAR and VARCHAR Types") column with no indexes,
as shown here:

```sql
mysql> CREATE DATABASE IF NOT EXISTS test;
Query OK, 1 row affected (0.06 sec)

mysql> USE test;
Database changed

mysql> CREATE TABLE t1 (
    ->    c1 BIGINT NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
    ->    c2 INT,
    ->    c3 INT UNIQUE,
    -> )  ENGINE=NDBCLUSTER;
Query OK, 0 rows affected (0.27 sec)
```

Following creation of the table, we insert 50,000 rows
containing random data; the precise method of generating and
inserting these rows makes no practical difference, and we
leave the method of accomplishing as an exercise for the user.

###### Finding a table and its indexes

This query can be used to find a specific table and its
indexes:

```sql
mysql> SELECT fq_name
    -> FROM ndbinfo.memory_per_fragment
    -> WHERE fq_name = 'test/def/t1' OR parent_fq_name='test/def/t1'
    -> GROUP BY fq_name;
+----------------------+

4 rows in set (0.13 sec)

mysql> SELECT COUNT(*) FROM t1;
+----------+
| COUNT(*) |
+----------+
|    50000 |
+----------+
1 row in set (0.00 sec)
```

###### Finding the memory allocated by schema elements

This query shows the memory allocated by each schema element
(in total across all replicas):

```sql
mysql> SELECT
    ->   fq_name AS Name,
    ->   SUM(fixed_elem_alloc_bytes) AS Fixed,
    ->   SUM(var_elem_alloc_bytes) AS Var,
    ->   SUM(hash_index_alloc_bytes) AS Hash,
    ->   SUM(fixed_elem_alloc_bytes+var_elem_alloc_bytes+hash_index_alloc_bytes) AS Total
    -> FROM ndbinfo.memory_per_fragment
    -> WHERE fq_name = 'test/def/t1' OR parent_fq_name='test/def/t1'
    -> GROUP BY fq_name;
+----------------------+---------+---------+---------+----------+

+----------------------+---------+---------+---------+----------+
4 rows in set (0.11 sec)
```

###### Finding the memory allocated for a table and all indexes

The sum of memory allocated for the table and all its indexes
(in total across all replicas) can be obtained using the query
shown here:

```sql
mysql> SELECT
    ->   SUM(fixed_elem_alloc_bytes) AS Fixed,
    ->   SUM(var_elem_alloc_bytes) AS Var,
    ->   SUM(hash_index_alloc_bytes) AS Hash,
    ->   SUM(fixed_elem_alloc_bytes+var_elem_alloc_bytes+hash_index_alloc_bytes) AS Total
    -> FROM ndbinfo.memory_per_fragment
    -> WHERE fq_name = 'test/def/t1' OR parent_fq_name='test/def/t1';
+----------+---------+---------+----------+
| Fixed    | Var     | Hash    | Total    |
+----------+---------+---------+----------+
| 11141120 | 5046272 | 2850816 | 19038208 |
+----------+---------+---------+----------+
1 row in set (0.12 sec)
```

This is an abbreviated version of the previous query which
shows only the total memory used by the table:

```sql
mysql> SELECT
    ->   SUM(fixed_elem_alloc_bytes+var_elem_alloc_bytes+hash_index_alloc_bytes) AS Total
    -> FROM ndbinfo.memory_per_fragment
    -> WHERE fq_name = 'test/def/t1' OR parent_fq_name='test/def/t1';
+----------+
| Total    |
+----------+
| 19038208 |
+----------+
1 row in set (0.12 sec)
```

###### Finding the memory allocated per row

The following query shows the total memory allocated per row
(across all replicas):

```sql
mysql> SELECT
    ->   SUM(fixed_elem_alloc_bytes+var_elem_alloc_bytes+hash_index_alloc_bytes)
    ->   /
    ->   SUM(fixed_elem_count) AS Total_alloc_per_row
    -> FROM ndbinfo.memory_per_fragment
    -> WHERE fq_name = 'test/def/t1';
+---------------------+
| Total_alloc_per_row |
+---------------------+
|            109.2813 |
+---------------------+
1 row in set (0.12 sec)
```

###### Finding the total memory in use per row

To obtain the total memory in use per row (across all
replicas), we need the total memory used divided by the row
count, which is the `fixed_elem_count` for
the base table like this:

```sql
mysql> SELECT
    ->   SUM(
    ->     (fixed_elem_alloc_bytes - fixed_elem_free_bytes)
    ->     + (var_elem_alloc_bytes - var_elem_free_bytes)
    ->     + hash_index_alloc_bytes
    ->   )
    ->   /
    ->   SUM(fixed_elem_count)
    ->   AS total_in_use_per_row
    -> FROM ndbinfo.memory_per_fragment
    -> WHERE fq_name = 'test/def/t1';
+----------------------+
| total_in_use_per_row |
+----------------------+
|             107.2042 |
+----------------------+
1 row in set (0.12 sec)
```

###### Finding the memory allocated per element

The memory allocated by each schema element (in total across
all replicas) can be found using the following query:

```sql
mysql> SELECT
    ->   fq_name AS Name,
    ->   SUM(fixed_elem_alloc_bytes) AS Fixed,
    ->   SUM(var_elem_alloc_bytes) AS Var,
    ->   SUM(hash_index_alloc_bytes) AS Hash,
    ->   SUM(fixed_elem_alloc_bytes + var_elem_alloc_bytes + hash_index_alloc_bytes)
    ->     AS Total_alloc
    -> FROM ndbinfo.memory_per_fragment
    -> WHERE fq_name = 'test/def/t1' OR parent_fq_name='test/def/t1'
    -> GROUP BY fq_name;
+----------------------+---------+---------+---------+-------------+
| Name                 | Fixed   | Var     | Hash    | Total_alloc |
+----------------------+---------+---------+---------+-------------+
| test/def/t1          | 4456448 | 5046272 | 1425408 |    10928128 |
| sys/def/13/PRIMARY   | 1966080 |       0 |       0 |     1966080 |
| sys/def/13/c3        | 1441792 |       0 |       0 |     1441792 |
| sys/def/13/c3$unique | 3276800 |       0 | 1425408 |     4702208 |
+----------------------+---------+---------+---------+-------------+
4 rows in set (0.11 sec)
```

###### Finding the average memory allocated per row, by element

To obtain the average memory allocated per row by each schema
element (in total across all replicas), we use a subquery to
get the base table fixed element count each time to get an
average per row since `fixed_elem_count` for
the indexes is not necessarily the same as for the base table,
as shown here:

```sql
mysql> SELECT
    ->   fq_name AS Name,
    ->   ( SELECT SUM(fixed_elem_count)
    ->     FROM ndbinfo.memory_per_fragment
    ->     WHERE fq_name='test/def/t1') AS Table_rows,
    ->
    ->   SUM(fixed_elem_alloc_bytes)
    ->   /
    ->   ( SELECT SUM(fixed_elem_count)
    ->     FROM ndbinfo.memory_per_fragment
    ->     WHERE fq_name='test/def/t1') AS Avg_fixed_alloc,
    ->
    ->   SUM(var_elem_alloc_bytes)
    ->   /
    ->   ( SELECT SUM(fixed_elem_count)
    ->     FROM ndbinfo.memory_per_fragment
    ->     WHERE fq_name='test/def/t1') as Avg_var_alloc,
    ->
    ->   SUM(hash_index_alloc_bytes)
    ->   /

###### Finding the average memory allocated per row for a table

To get the average amount of memory allocated per row for the
entire table across all replicas, we can use the query shown
here:

```sql
mysql> SELECT
    ->   ( SELECT SUM(fixed_elem_count)
    ->     FROM ndbinfo.memory_per_fragment
    ->     WHERE fq_name='test/def/t1') AS table_rows,
    ->
    ->   SUM(fixed_elem_alloc_bytes + var_elem_alloc_bytes + hash_index_alloc_bytes)
    ->   /
    ->   ( SELECT SUM(fixed_elem_count)
    ->     FROM ndbinfo.memory_per_fragment
    ->     WHERE fq_name='test/def/t1') AS avg_total_alloc
    ->
    -> FROM ndbinfo.memory_per_fragment
    -> WHERE fq_name = 'test/def/t1' OR parent_fq_name='test/def/t1';
+------------+-----------------+
| table_rows | avg_total_alloc |
+------------+-----------------+
|     100000 |        190.3821 |
+------------+-----------------+
1 row in set (0.33 sec)
```

###### Finding the memory in use by each schema element

To obtain the memory in use per schema element across all
replicas, we need to sum the difference between allocated and
free memory for each element, like this:

```sql
mysql> SELECT
    ->   fq_name AS Name,
    ->   SUM(fixed_elem_alloc_bytes - fixed_elem_free_bytes) AS fixed_inuse,
    ->   SUM(var_elem_alloc_bytes-var_elem_free_bytes) AS var_inuse,
    ->   SUM(hash_index_alloc_bytes) AS hash_memory,
    ->   SUM(  (fixed_elem_alloc_bytes - fixed_elem_free_bytes)
    ->       + (var_elem_alloc_bytes - var_elem_free_bytes)
    ->       + hash_index_alloc_bytes) AS total_alloc
    -> FROM ndbinfo.memory_per_fragment
    -> WHERE fq_name = 'test/def/t1' OR parent_fq_name='test/def/t1'
    -> GROUP BY fq_name;
+----------------------+-------------+-----------+---------+-------------+
| fq_name              | fixed_inuse | var_inuse | hash    | total_alloc |
+----------------------+-------------+-----------+---------+-------------+
