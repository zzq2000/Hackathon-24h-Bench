#### 7.9.1.2 Creating Trace Files

If the [**mysqld**](mysqld.md "6.3.1 mysqld — The MySQL Server") server does not start or it
crashes easily, you can try to create a trace file to find the
problem.

To do this, you must have a [**mysqld**](mysqld.md "6.3.1 mysqld — The MySQL Server") that has
been compiled with debugging support. You can check this by
executing `mysqld -V`. If the version number
ends with `-debug`, it is compiled with support
for trace files. (On Windows, the debugging server is named
[**mysqld-debug**](mysqld.md "6.3.1 mysqld — The MySQL Server") rather than
[**mysqld**](mysqld.md "6.3.1 mysqld — The MySQL Server").)

Start the [**mysqld**](mysqld.md "6.3.1 mysqld — The MySQL Server") server with a trace log in
`/tmp/mysqld.trace` on Unix or
`\mysqld.trace` on Windows:

```terminal
$> mysqld --debug
```

On Windows, you should also use the
[`--standalone`](server-options.md#option_mysqld_standalone) flag to not start
[**mysqld**](mysqld.md "6.3.1 mysqld — The MySQL Server") as a service. In a console window, use
this command:

```terminal
C:\> mysqld-debug --debug --standalone
```

After this, you can use the `mysql.exe`
command-line tool in a second console window to reproduce the
problem. You can stop the [**mysqld**](mysqld.md "6.3.1 mysqld — The MySQL Server") server with
[**mysqladmin shutdown**](mysqladmin.md "6.5.2 mysqladmin — A MySQL Server Administration Program").

The trace file can become **very
large**! To generate a smaller trace file, you can use
debugging options something like this:

[**mysqld
--debug=d,info,error,query,general,where:O,/tmp/mysqld.trace**](mysqld.md "6.3.1 mysqld — The MySQL Server")

This only prints information with the most interesting tags to
the trace file.

If you file a bug, please add only those lines from the trace
file to the bug report that indicate where something seems to go
wrong. If you cannot locate the wrong place, open a bug report
and upload the whole trace file to the report, so that a MySQL
developer can take a look at it. For instructions, see
[Section 1.5, “How to Report Bugs or Problems”](bug-reports.md "1.5 How to Report Bugs or Problems").

The trace file is made with the `DBUG` package
by Fred Fish. See [Section 7.9.4, “The DBUG Package”](dbug-package.md "7.9.4 The DBUG Package").
