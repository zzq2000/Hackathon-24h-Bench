#### 19.1.5.4 Adding Binary Log Based Replication Sources to a Multi-Source Replica

These steps assume that binary logging is enabled on the source
(which is the default), the replica is using
`TABLE` based replication applier metadata
repositories (which is the default in MySQL 8.0), and
that you have enabled a replication user and noted the current
binary log file name and position.

Use the [`CHANGE REPLICATION SOURCE
TO`](change-replication-source-to.md "15.4.2.3 CHANGE REPLICATION SOURCE TO Statement") statement (from MySQL 8.0.23) or
[`CHANGE MASTER TO`](change-master-to.md "15.4.2.1 CHANGE MASTER TO Statement") statement (before
MySQL 8.0.23) to configure a replication channel for each source
on the replica (see [Section 19.2.2, “Replication Channels”](replication-channels.md "19.2.2 Replication Channels")). The
`FOR CHANNEL` clause is used to specify the
channel. For example, to add `source1` and
`source2` as sources to the replica, use the
[**mysql**](mysql.md "6.5.1 mysql — The MySQL Command-Line Client") client to issue the statement twice on
the replica, like this:

```sql
mysql> CHANGE MASTER TO MASTER_HOST="source1", MASTER_USER="ted", MASTER_PASSWORD="password", \
MASTER_LOG_FILE='source1-bin.000006', MASTER_LOG_POS=628 FOR CHANNEL "source_1";
mysql> CHANGE MASTER TO MASTER_HOST="source2", MASTER_USER="ted", MASTER_PASSWORD="password", \
MASTER_LOG_FILE='source2-bin.000018', MASTER_LOG_POS=104 FOR CHANNEL "source_2";

Or from MySQL 8.0.23:
mysql> CHANGE REPLICATION SOURCE TO SOURCE_HOST="source1", SOURCE_USER="ted", SOURCE_PASSWORD="password", \
SOURCE_LOG_FILE='source1-bin.000006', SOURCE_LOG_POS=628 FOR CHANNEL "source_1";
mysql> CHANGE REPLICATION SOURCE TO SOURCE_HOST="source2", SOURCE_USER="ted", SOURCE_PASSWORD="password", \
SOURCE_LOG_FILE='source2-bin.000018', SOURCE_LOG_POS=104 FOR CHANNEL "source_2";
```

To make the replica replicate only database `db1`
from `source1`, and only database
`db2` from `source2`, use the
[**mysql**](mysql.md "6.5.1 mysql — The MySQL Command-Line Client") client to issue the
[`CHANGE REPLICATION FILTER`](change-replication-filter.md "15.4.2.2 CHANGE REPLICATION FILTER Statement") statement
for each channel, like this:

```sql
mysql> CHANGE REPLICATION FILTER REPLICATE_WILD_DO_TABLE = ('db1.%') FOR CHANNEL "source_1";
mysql> CHANGE REPLICATION FILTER REPLICATE_WILD_DO_TABLE = ('db2.%') FOR CHANNEL "source_2";
```

For the full syntax of the [`CHANGE REPLICATION
FILTER`](change-replication-filter.md "15.4.2.2 CHANGE REPLICATION FILTER Statement") statement and other available options, see
[Section 15.4.2.2, “CHANGE REPLICATION FILTER Statement”](change-replication-filter.md "15.4.2.2 CHANGE REPLICATION FILTER Statement").
