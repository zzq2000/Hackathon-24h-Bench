#### 10.2.1.14 Constant-Folding Optimization

Comparisons between constants and column values in which the
constant value is out of range or of the wrong type with
respect to the column type are now handled once during query
optimization rather row-by-row than during execution. The
comparisons that can be treated in this manner are
`>`, `>=`,
`<`, `<=`,
`<>`/`!=`,
`=`, and `<=>`.

Consider the table created by the following statement:

```sql
CREATE TABLE t (c TINYINT UNSIGNED NOT NULL);
```

The `WHERE` condition in the query
`SELECT * FROM t WHERE c < 256` contains
the integral constant 256 which is out of range for a
`TINYINT UNSIGNED` column. Previously, this
was handled by treating both operands as the larger type, but
now, since any allowed value for `c` is less
than the constant, the `WHERE` expression can
instead be folded as `WHERE 1`, so that the
query is rewritten as `SELECT * FROM t WHERE
1`.

This makes it possible for the optimizer to remove the
`WHERE` expression altogether. If the column
`c` were nullable (that is, defined only as
`TINYINT UNSIGNED`) the query would be
rewritten like this:

```sql
SELECT * FROM t WHERE ti IS NOT NULL
```

Folding is performed for constants compared to supported MySQL
column types as follows:

- **Integer column type.**
  Integer types are compared with constants of the
  following types as described here:

  - **Integer value.**
    If the constant is out of range for the column type,
    the comparison is folded to `1` or
    `IS NOT NULL`, as already shown.

    If the constant is a range boundary, the comparison is
    folded to `=`. For example (using the
    same table as already defined):

    ```sql
    mysql> EXPLAIN SELECT * FROM t WHERE c >= 255;
    *************************** 1. row ***************************
               id: 1
      select_type: SIMPLE
            table: t
       partitions: NULL
             type: ALL
    possible_keys: NULL
              key: NULL
          key_len: NULL
              ref: NULL
             rows: 5
         filtered: 20.00

    mysql> SHOW WARNINGS;
    *************************** 1. row ***************************
      Level: Note
       Code: 1003
    Message: /* select#1 */ select `test`.`t`.`ti` AS `ti` from `test`.`t` where (`test`.`t`.`ti` = 255)
    1 row in set (0.00 sec)
    ```
  - **Floating- or fixed-point value.**
    If the constant is one of the decimal types (such as
    `DECIMAL`, `REAL`,
    `DOUBLE`, or
    `FLOAT`) and has a nonzero decimal
    portion, it cannot be equal; fold accordingly. For
    other comparisons, round up or down to an integer
    value according to the sign, then perform a range
    check and handle as already described for
    integer-integer comparisons.

    A `REAL` value that is too small to
    be represented as `DECIMAL` is
    rounded to .01 or -.01 depending on the sign, then
    handled as a `DECIMAL`.
  - **String types.**
    Try to interpret the string value as an integer
    type, then handle the comparison as between integer
    values. If this fails, attempt to handle the value
    as a `REAL`.
- **DECIMAL or REAL column.**
  Decimal types are compared with constants of the
  following types as described here:

  - **Integer value.**
    Perform a range check against the column
    value's integer part. If no folding results,
    convert the constant to `DECIMAL`
    with the same number of decimal places as the column
    value, then check it as a `DECIMAL`
    (see next).
  - **DECIMAL or REAL value.**
    Check for overflow (that is, whether the constant
    has more digits in its integer part than allowed for
    the column's decimal type). If so, fold.

    If the constant has more significant fractional digits
    than column's type, truncate the constant. If the
    comparison operator is `=` or
    `<>`, fold. If the operator is
    `>=` or `<=`,
    adjust the operator due to truncation. For example, if
    column's type is `DECIMAL(3,1)`,
    `SELECT * FROM t WHERE f >= 10.13`
    becomes `SELECT * FROM t WHERE f >
    10.1`.

    If the constant has fewer decimal digits than the
    column's type, convert it to a constant with same
    number of digits. For underflow of a
    `REAL` value (that is, too few
    fractional digits to represent it), convert the
    constant to decimal 0.
  - **String value.**
    If the value can be interpreted as an integer type,
    handle it as such. Otherwise, try to handle it as
    `REAL`.
- **FLOAT or DOUBLE column.**
  `FLOAT(m,n)`
  or
  `DOUBLE(m,n)`
  values compared with constants are handled as follows:

  If the value overflows the range of the column, fold.

  If the value has more than *`n`*
  decimals, truncate, compensating during folding. For
  `=` and `<>`
  comparisons, fold to `TRUE`,
  `FALSE`, or `IS [NOT]
  NULL` as described previously; for other
  operators, adjust the operator.

  If the value has more than `m` integer
  digits, fold.

**Limitations.**
This optimization cannot be used in the following cases:

1. With comparisons using `BETWEEN` or
   `IN`.
2. With `BIT` columns or columns using date
   or time types.
3. During the preparation phase for a prepared statement,
   although it can be applied during the optimization phase
   when the prepared statement is actually executed. This due
   to the fact that, during statement preparation, the value
   of the constant is not yet known.
