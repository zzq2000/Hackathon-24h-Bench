This chapter explains MySQL Group Replication and how to install,
configure and monitor groups. MySQL Group Replication enables you to
create elastic, highly-available, fault-tolerant replication
topologies.

Groups can operate in a single-primary mode with automatic primary
election, where only one server accepts updates at a time.
Alternatively, groups can be deployed in multi-primary mode, where
all servers can accept updates, even if they are issued
concurrently.

There is a built-in group membership service that keeps the view of
the group consistent and available for all servers at any given
point in time. Servers can leave and join the group and the view is
updated accordingly. Sometimes servers can leave the group
unexpectedly, in which case the failure detection mechanism detects
this and notifies the group that the view has changed. This is all
automatic.

Group Replication guarantees that the database service is
continuously available. However, it is important to understand that
if one of the group members becomes unavailable, the clients
connected to that group member must be redirected, or failed over,
to a different server in the group, using a connector, load
balancer, router, or some form of middleware. Group Replication does
not have an inbuilt method to do this. For example, see
[MySQL Router 8.0](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/mysql-router/8.0/en/).

Group Replication is provided as a plugin to MySQL Server. You can
follow the instructions in this chapter to configure the plugin on
each of the server instances that you want in the group, start up
the group, and monitor and administer the group. An alternative way
to deploy a group of MySQL server instances is by using
InnoDB Cluster.

Tip

To deploy multiple instances of MySQL, you can use [InnoDB Cluster](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/mysql-shell/8.0/en/mysql-innodb-cluster.html) which enables you to easily administer a group of MySQL server instances in [MySQL Shell](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/mysql-shell/8.0/en/). InnoDB Cluster wraps MySQL Group Replication in a programmatic environment that enables you easily deploy a cluster of MySQL instances to achieve high availability. In addition, InnoDB Cluster interfaces seamlessly with [MySQL Router](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/mysql-router/8.0/en/), which enables your applications to connect to the cluster without writing your own failover process. For similar use cases that do not require high availability, however, you can use [InnoDB ReplicaSet](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/mysql-shell/8.0/en/mysql-innodb-replicaset.html). Installation instructions for MySQL Shell can be found [here](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/mysql-shell/8.0/en/mysql-shell-install.html).
