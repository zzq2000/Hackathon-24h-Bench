#### B.3.2.3 Lost connection to MySQL server

There are three likely causes for this error message.

Usually it indicates network connectivity trouble and you
should check the condition of your network if this error
occurs frequently. If the error message includes “during
query,” this is probably the case you are experiencing.

Sometimes the “during query” form happens when
millions of rows are being sent as part of one or more
queries. If you know that this is happening, you should try
increasing [`net_read_timeout`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_net_read_timeout)
from its default of 30 seconds to 60 seconds or longer,
sufficient for the data transfer to complete.

More rarely, it can happen when the client is attempting the
initial connection to the server. In this case, if your
[`connect_timeout`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_connect_timeout) value is set
to only a few seconds, you may be able to resolve the problem
by increasing it to ten seconds, perhaps more if you have a
very long distance or slow connection. You can determine
whether you are experiencing this more uncommon cause by using
`SHOW GLOBAL STATUS LIKE 'Aborted_connects'`.
It increases by one for each initial connection attempt that
the server aborts. You may see “reading authorization
packet” as part of the error message; if so, that also
suggests that this is the solution that you need.

If the cause is none of those just described, you may be
experiencing a problem with
[`BLOB`](blob.md "13.3.4 The BLOB and TEXT Types") values that are larger
than [`max_allowed_packet`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_max_allowed_packet),
which can cause this error with some clients. Sometime you may
see an [`ER_NET_PACKET_TOO_LARGE`](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/mysql-errors/8.0/en/server-error-reference.html#error_er_net_packet_too_large)
error, and that confirms that you need to increase
[`max_allowed_packet`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_max_allowed_packet).
