### 9.6.3 How to Repair MyISAM Tables

The discussion in this section describes how to use
[**myisamchk**](myisamchk.md "6.6.4 myisamchk — MyISAM Table-Maintenance Utility") on `MyISAM` tables
(extensions `.MYI` and
`.MYD`).

You can also use the [`CHECK TABLE`](check-table.md "15.7.3.2 CHECK TABLE Statement")
and [`REPAIR TABLE`](repair-table.md "15.7.3.5 REPAIR TABLE Statement") statements to
check and repair `MyISAM` tables. See
[Section 15.7.3.2, “CHECK TABLE Statement”](check-table.md "15.7.3.2 CHECK TABLE Statement"), and
[Section 15.7.3.5, “REPAIR TABLE Statement”](repair-table.md "15.7.3.5 REPAIR TABLE Statement").

Symptoms of corrupted tables include queries that abort
unexpectedly and observable errors such as these:

- Can't find file
  `tbl_name.MYI`
  (Errcode: *`nnn`*)
- Unexpected end of file
- Record file is crashed
- Got error *`nnn`* from table handler

To get more information about the error, run
[**perror**](perror.md "6.8.2 perror — Display MySQL Error Message Information") *`nnn`*, where
*`nnn`* is the error number. The
following example shows how to use [**perror**](perror.md "6.8.2 perror — Display MySQL Error Message Information") to
find the meanings for the most common error numbers that
indicate a problem with a table:

```terminal
$> perror 126 127 132 134 135 136 141 144 145
MySQL error code 126 = Index file is crashed
MySQL error code 127 = Record-file is crashed
MySQL error code 132 = Old database file
MySQL error code 134 = Record was already deleted (or record file crashed)
MySQL error code 135 = No more room in record file
MySQL error code 136 = No more room in index file
MySQL error code 141 = Duplicate unique key or constraint on write or update
MySQL error code 144 = Table is crashed and last repair failed
MySQL error code 145 = Table was marked as crashed and should be repaired
```

Note that error 135 (no more room in record file) and error 136
(no more room in index file) are not errors that can be fixed by
a simple repair. In this case, you must use
[`ALTER TABLE`](alter-table.md "15.1.9 ALTER TABLE Statement") to increase the
`MAX_ROWS` and
`AVG_ROW_LENGTH` table option values:

```sql
ALTER TABLE tbl_name MAX_ROWS=xxx AVG_ROW_LENGTH=yyy;
```

If you do not know the current table option values, use
[`SHOW CREATE TABLE`](show-create-table.md "15.7.7.10 SHOW CREATE TABLE Statement").

For the other errors, you must repair your tables.
[**myisamchk**](myisamchk.md "6.6.4 myisamchk — MyISAM Table-Maintenance Utility") can usually detect and fix most
problems that occur.

The repair process involves up to three stages, described here.
Before you begin, you should change location to the database
directory and check the permissions of the table files. On Unix,
make sure that they are readable by the user that
[**mysqld**](mysqld.md "6.3.1 mysqld — The MySQL Server") runs as (and to you, because you need
to access the files you are checking). If it turns out you need
to modify files, they must also be writable by you.

This section is for the cases where a table check fails (such as
those described in [Section 9.6.2, “How to Check MyISAM Tables for Errors”](myisam-check.md "9.6.2 How to Check MyISAM Tables for Errors")), or you want
to use the extended features that [**myisamchk**](myisamchk.md "6.6.4 myisamchk — MyISAM Table-Maintenance Utility")
provides.

The [**myisamchk**](myisamchk.md "6.6.4 myisamchk — MyISAM Table-Maintenance Utility") options used for table
maintenance with are described in [Section 6.6.4, “myisamchk — MyISAM Table-Maintenance Utility”](myisamchk.md "6.6.4 myisamchk — MyISAM Table-Maintenance Utility").
[**myisamchk**](myisamchk.md "6.6.4 myisamchk — MyISAM Table-Maintenance Utility") also has variables that you can set
to control memory allocation that may improve performance. See
[Section 6.6.4.6, “myisamchk Memory Usage”](myisamchk-memory.md "6.6.4.6 myisamchk Memory Usage").

If you are going to repair a table from the command line, you
must first stop the [**mysqld**](mysqld.md "6.3.1 mysqld — The MySQL Server") server. Note that
when you do [**mysqladmin shutdown**](mysqladmin.md "6.5.2 mysqladmin — A MySQL Server Administration Program") on a remote
server, the [**mysqld**](mysqld.md "6.3.1 mysqld — The MySQL Server") server is still available
for a while after [**mysqladmin**](mysqladmin.md "6.5.2 mysqladmin — A MySQL Server Administration Program") returns, until
all statement-processing has stopped and all index changes have
been flushed to disk.

**Stage 1: Checking your tables**

Run [**myisamchk \*.MYI**](myisamchk.md "6.6.4 myisamchk — MyISAM Table-Maintenance Utility") or [**myisamchk -e
\*.MYI**](myisamchk.md "6.6.4 myisamchk — MyISAM Table-Maintenance Utility") if you have more time. Use the
`-s` (silent) option to suppress unnecessary
information.

If the [**mysqld**](mysqld.md "6.3.1 mysqld — The MySQL Server") server is stopped, you should
use the [`--update-state`](myisamchk-check-options.md#option_myisamchk_update-state) option
to tell [**myisamchk**](myisamchk.md "6.6.4 myisamchk — MyISAM Table-Maintenance Utility") to mark the table as
“checked.”

You have to repair only those tables for which
[**myisamchk**](myisamchk.md "6.6.4 myisamchk — MyISAM Table-Maintenance Utility") announces an error. For such
tables, proceed to Stage 2.

If you get unexpected errors when checking (such as `out
of memory` errors), or if [**myisamchk**](myisamchk.md "6.6.4 myisamchk — MyISAM Table-Maintenance Utility")
crashes, go to Stage 3.

**Stage 2: Easy safe repair**

First, try [**myisamchk -r -q
*`tbl_name`***](myisamchk.md "6.6.4 myisamchk — MyISAM Table-Maintenance Utility") (`-r
-q` means “quick recovery mode”). This
attempts to repair the index file without touching the data
file. If the data file contains everything that it should and
the delete links point at the correct locations within the data
file, this should work, and the table is fixed. Start repairing
the next table. Otherwise, use the following procedure:

1. Make a backup of the data file before continuing.
2. Use [**myisamchk -r
   *`tbl_name`***](myisamchk.md "6.6.4 myisamchk — MyISAM Table-Maintenance Utility")
   (`-r` means “recovery mode”).
   This removes incorrect rows and deleted rows from the data
   file and reconstructs the index file.
3. If the preceding step fails, use [**myisamchk
   --safe-recover
   *`tbl_name`***](myisamchk.md "6.6.4 myisamchk — MyISAM Table-Maintenance Utility"). Safe recovery
   mode uses an old recovery method that handles a few cases
   that regular recovery mode does not (but is slower).

Note

If you want a repair operation to go much faster, you should
set the values of the
[`sort_buffer_size`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_sort_buffer_size) and
[`key_buffer_size`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_key_buffer_size) variables
each to about 25% of your available memory when running
[**myisamchk**](myisamchk.md "6.6.4 myisamchk — MyISAM Table-Maintenance Utility").

If you get unexpected errors when repairing (such as
`out of memory` errors), or if
[**myisamchk**](myisamchk.md "6.6.4 myisamchk — MyISAM Table-Maintenance Utility") crashes, go to Stage 3.

**Stage 3: Difficult repair**

You should reach this stage only if the first 16KB block in the
index file is destroyed or contains incorrect information, or if
the index file is missing. In this case, it is necessary to
create a new index file. Do so as follows:

1. Move the data file to a safe place.
2. Use the table description file to create new (empty) data
   and index files:

   ```terminal
   $> mysql db_name
   ```

   ```sql
   mysql> SET autocommit=1;
   mysql> TRUNCATE TABLE tbl_name;
   mysql> quit
   ```
3. Copy the old data file back onto the newly created data
   file. (Do not just move the old file back onto the new file.
   You want to retain a copy in case something goes wrong.)

Important

If you are using replication, you should stop it prior to
performing the above procedure, since it involves file system
operations, and these are not logged by MySQL.

Go back to Stage 2. [**myisamchk -r -q**](myisamchk.md "6.6.4 myisamchk — MyISAM Table-Maintenance Utility") should
work. (This should not be an endless loop.)

You can also use the `REPAIR TABLE
tbl_name USE_FRM` SQL
statement, which performs the whole procedure automatically.
There is also no possibility of unwanted interaction between a
utility and the server, because the server does all the work
when you use [`REPAIR TABLE`](repair-table.md "15.7.3.5 REPAIR TABLE Statement"). See
[Section 15.7.3.5, “REPAIR TABLE Statement”](repair-table.md "15.7.3.5 REPAIR TABLE Statement").
