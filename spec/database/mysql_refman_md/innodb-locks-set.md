### 17.7.3 Locks Set by Different SQL Statements in InnoDB

A [locking read](glossary.md#glos_locking_read "locking read"), an
[`UPDATE`](update.md "15.2.17 UPDATE Statement"), or a
[`DELETE`](delete.md "15.2.2 DELETE Statement") generally set record locks
on every index record that is scanned in the processing of an SQL
statement. It does not matter whether there are
`WHERE` conditions in the statement that would
exclude the row. `InnoDB` does not remember the
exact `WHERE` condition, but only knows which
index ranges were scanned. The locks are normally
[next-key locks](glossary.md#glos_next_key_lock "next-key lock") that also
block inserts into the “gap” immediately before the
record. However, [gap locking](glossary.md#glos_gap_lock "gap lock")
can be disabled explicitly, which causes next-key locking not to
be used. For more information, see
[Section 17.7.1, “InnoDB Locking”](innodb-locking.md "17.7.1 InnoDB Locking"). The transaction isolation level
can also affect which locks are set; see
[Section 17.7.2.1, “Transaction Isolation Levels”](innodb-transaction-isolation-levels.md "17.7.2.1 Transaction Isolation Levels").

If a secondary index is used in a search and the index record
locks to be set are exclusive, `InnoDB` also
retrieves the corresponding clustered index records and sets locks
on them.

If you have no indexes suitable for your statement and MySQL must
scan the entire table to process the statement, every row of the
table becomes locked, which in turn blocks all inserts by other
users to the table. It is important to create good indexes so that
your queries do not scan more rows than necessary.

`InnoDB` sets specific types of locks as follows.

- [`SELECT ...
  FROM`](select.md "15.2.13 SELECT Statement") is a consistent read, reading a snapshot of the
  database and setting no locks unless the transaction isolation
  level is set to
  [`SERIALIZABLE`](innodb-transaction-isolation-levels.md#isolevel_serializable). For
  [`SERIALIZABLE`](innodb-transaction-isolation-levels.md#isolevel_serializable) level, the
  search sets shared next-key locks on the index records it
  encounters. However, only an index record lock is required for
  statements that lock rows using a unique index to search for a
  unique row.
- [`SELECT ... FOR
  UPDATE`](select.md "15.2.13 SELECT Statement") and
  [`SELECT ... FOR
  SHARE`](select.md "15.2.13 SELECT Statement") statements that use a unique index acquire
  locks for scanned rows, and release the locks for rows that do
  not qualify for inclusion in the result set (for example, if
  they do not meet the criteria given in the
  `WHERE` clause). However, in some cases, rows
  might not be unlocked immediately because the relationship
  between a result row and its original source is lost during
  query execution. For example, in a
  [`UNION`](union.md "15.2.18 UNION Clause"), scanned (and locked)
  rows from a table might be inserted into a temporary table
  before evaluating whether they qualify for the result set. In
  this circumstance, the relationship of the rows in the
  temporary table to the rows in the original table is lost and
  the latter rows are not unlocked until the end of query
  execution.
- For [locking reads](glossary.md#glos_locking_read "locking read")
  ([`SELECT`](select.md "15.2.13 SELECT Statement") with `FOR
  UPDATE` or `FOR SHARE`),
  [`UPDATE`](update.md "15.2.17 UPDATE Statement"), and
  [`DELETE`](delete.md "15.2.2 DELETE Statement") statements, the locks
  that are taken depend on whether the statement uses a unique
  index with a unique search condition or a range-type search
  condition.

  - For a unique index with a unique search condition,
    `InnoDB` locks only the index record
    found, not the [gap](glossary.md#glos_gap "gap") before
    it.
  - For other search conditions, and for non-unique indexes,
    `InnoDB` locks the index range scanned,
    using [gap locks](glossary.md#glos_gap_lock "gap lock") or
    [next-key locks](glossary.md#glos_next_key_lock "next-key lock")
    to block insertions by other sessions into the gaps
    covered by the range. For information about gap locks and
    next-key locks, see [Section 17.7.1, “InnoDB Locking”](innodb-locking.md "17.7.1 InnoDB Locking").
- For index records the search encounters,
  [`SELECT ... FOR
  UPDATE`](select.md "15.2.13 SELECT Statement") blocks other sessions from doing
  [`SELECT ... FOR
  SHARE`](select.md "15.2.13 SELECT Statement") or from reading in certain transaction
  isolation levels. Consistent reads ignore any locks set on the
  records that exist in the read view.
- [`UPDATE ... WHERE
  ...`](update.md "15.2.17 UPDATE Statement") sets an exclusive next-key lock on every record
  the search encounters. However, only an index record lock is
  required for statements that lock rows using a unique index to
  search for a unique row.
- When [`UPDATE`](update.md "15.2.17 UPDATE Statement") modifies a
  clustered index record, implicit locks are taken on affected
  secondary index records. The
  [`UPDATE`](update.md "15.2.17 UPDATE Statement") operation also takes
  shared locks on affected secondary index records when
  performing duplicate check scans prior to inserting new
  secondary index records, and when inserting new secondary
  index records.
- [`DELETE FROM ... WHERE
  ...`](delete.md "15.2.2 DELETE Statement") sets an exclusive next-key lock on every record
  the search encounters. However, only an index record lock is
  required for statements that lock rows using a unique index to
  search for a unique row.
- [`INSERT`](insert.md "15.2.7 INSERT Statement") sets an exclusive lock
  on the inserted row. This lock is an index-record lock, not a
  next-key lock (that is, there is no gap lock) and does not
  prevent other sessions from inserting into the gap before the
  inserted row.

  Prior to inserting the row, a type of gap lock called an
  insert intention gap lock is set. This lock signals the intent
  to insert in such a way that multiple transactions inserting
  into the same index gap need not wait for each other if they
  are not inserting at the same position within the gap. Suppose
  that there are index records with values of 4 and 7. Separate
  transactions that attempt to insert values of 5 and 6 each
  lock the gap between 4 and 7 with insert intention locks prior
  to obtaining the exclusive lock on the inserted row, but do
  not block each other because the rows are nonconflicting.

  If a duplicate-key error occurs, a shared lock on the
  duplicate index record is set. This use of a shared lock can
  result in deadlock should there be multiple sessions trying to
  insert the same row if another session already has an
  exclusive lock. This can occur if another session deletes the
  row. Suppose that an `InnoDB` table
  `t1` has the following structure:

  ```sql
  CREATE TABLE t1 (i INT, PRIMARY KEY (i)) ENGINE = InnoDB;
  ```

  Now suppose that three sessions perform the following
  operations in order:

  Session 1:

  ```sql
  START TRANSACTION;
  INSERT INTO t1 VALUES(1);
  ```

  Session 2:

  ```sql
  START TRANSACTION;
  INSERT INTO t1 VALUES(1);
  ```

  Session 3:

  ```sql
  START TRANSACTION;
  INSERT INTO t1 VALUES(1);
  ```

  Session 1:

  ```sql
  ROLLBACK;
  ```

  The first operation by session 1 acquires an exclusive lock
  for the row. The operations by sessions 2 and 3 both result in
  a duplicate-key error and they both request a shared lock for
  the row. When session 1 rolls back, it releases its exclusive
  lock on the row and the queued shared lock requests for
  sessions 2 and 3 are granted. At this point, sessions 2 and 3
  deadlock: Neither can acquire an exclusive lock for the row
  because of the shared lock held by the other.

  A similar situation occurs if the table already contains a row
  with key value 1 and three sessions perform the following
  operations in order:

  Session 1:

  ```sql
  START TRANSACTION;
  DELETE FROM t1 WHERE i = 1;
  ```

  Session 2:

  ```sql
  START TRANSACTION;
  INSERT INTO t1 VALUES(1);
  ```

  Session 3:

  ```sql
  START TRANSACTION;
  INSERT INTO t1 VALUES(1);
  ```

  Session 1:

  ```sql
  COMMIT;
  ```

  The first operation by session 1 acquires an exclusive lock
  for the row. The operations by sessions 2 and 3 both result in
  a duplicate-key error and they both request a shared lock for
  the row. When session 1 commits, it releases its exclusive
  lock on the row and the queued shared lock requests for
  sessions 2 and 3 are granted. At this point, sessions 2 and 3
  deadlock: Neither can acquire an exclusive lock for the row
  because of the shared lock held by the other.
- [`INSERT
  ... ON DUPLICATE KEY UPDATE`](insert-on-duplicate.md "15.2.7.2 INSERT ... ON DUPLICATE KEY UPDATE Statement") differs from a simple
  [`INSERT`](insert.md "15.2.7 INSERT Statement") in that an exclusive
  lock rather than a shared lock is placed on the row to be
  updated when a duplicate-key error occurs. An exclusive
  index-record lock is taken for a duplicate primary key value.
  An exclusive next-key lock is taken for a duplicate unique key
  value.
- [`REPLACE`](replace.md "15.2.12 REPLACE Statement") is done like an
  [`INSERT`](insert.md "15.2.7 INSERT Statement") if there is no collision
  on a unique key. Otherwise, an exclusive next-key lock is
  placed on the row to be replaced.
- `INSERT INTO T SELECT ... FROM S WHERE ...`
  sets an exclusive index record lock (without a gap lock) on
  each row inserted into `T`. If the
  transaction isolation level is [`READ
  COMMITTED`](innodb-transaction-isolation-levels.md#isolevel_read-committed), `InnoDB` does the search
  on `S` as a consistent read (no locks).
  Otherwise, `InnoDB` sets shared next-key
  locks on rows from `S`.
  `InnoDB` has to set locks in the latter case:
  During roll-forward recovery using a statement-based binary
  log, every SQL statement must be executed in exactly the same
  way it was done originally.

  [`CREATE TABLE ...
  SELECT ...`](create-table.md "15.1.20 CREATE TABLE Statement") performs the
  [`SELECT`](select.md "15.2.13 SELECT Statement") with shared next-key
  locks or as a consistent read, as for
  [`INSERT ...
  SELECT`](insert-select.md "15.2.7.1 INSERT ... SELECT Statement").

  When a `SELECT` is used in the constructs
  `REPLACE INTO t SELECT ... FROM s WHERE ...`
  or `UPDATE t ... WHERE col IN (SELECT ... FROM s
  ...)`, `InnoDB` sets shared next-key
  locks on rows from table `s`.
- `InnoDB` sets an exclusive lock on the end of
  the index associated with the
  `AUTO_INCREMENT` column while initializing a
  previously specified `AUTO_INCREMENT` column
  on a table.

  With
  [`innodb_autoinc_lock_mode=0`](innodb-parameters.md#sysvar_innodb_autoinc_lock_mode),
  `InnoDB` uses a special
  `AUTO-INC` table lock mode where the lock is
  obtained and held to the end of the current SQL statement (not
  to the end of the entire transaction) while accessing the
  auto-increment counter. Other clients cannot insert into the
  table while the `AUTO-INC` table lock is
  held. The same behavior occurs for “bulk inserts”
  with
  [`innodb_autoinc_lock_mode=1`](innodb-parameters.md#sysvar_innodb_autoinc_lock_mode).
  Table-level `AUTO-INC` locks are not used
  with
  [`innodb_autoinc_lock_mode=2`](innodb-parameters.md#sysvar_innodb_autoinc_lock_mode).
  For more information, See
  [Section 17.6.1.6, “AUTO\_INCREMENT Handling in InnoDB”](innodb-auto-increment-handling.md "17.6.1.6 AUTO_INCREMENT Handling in InnoDB").

  `InnoDB` fetches the value of a previously
  initialized `AUTO_INCREMENT` column without
  setting any locks.
- If a `FOREIGN KEY` constraint is defined on a
  table, any insert, update, or delete that requires the
  constraint condition to be checked sets shared record-level
  locks on the records that it looks at to check the constraint.
  `InnoDB` also sets these locks in the case
  where the constraint fails.
- [`LOCK TABLES`](lock-tables.md "15.3.6 LOCK TABLES and UNLOCK TABLES Statements") sets table locks,
  but it is the higher MySQL layer above the
  `InnoDB` layer that sets these locks.
  `InnoDB` is aware of table locks if
  `innodb_table_locks = 1` (the default) and
  [`autocommit = 0`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_autocommit), and the MySQL
  layer above `InnoDB` knows about row-level
  locks.

  Otherwise, `InnoDB`'s automatic deadlock
  detection cannot detect deadlocks where such table locks are
  involved. Also, because in this case the higher MySQL layer
  does not know about row-level locks, it is possible to get a
  table lock on a table where another session currently has
  row-level locks. However, this does not endanger transaction
  integrity, as discussed in
  [Section 17.7.5.2, “Deadlock Detection”](innodb-deadlock-detection.md "17.7.5.2 Deadlock Detection").
- [`LOCK TABLES`](lock-tables.md "15.3.6 LOCK TABLES and UNLOCK TABLES Statements") acquires two locks
  on each table if `innodb_table_locks=1` (the
  default). In addition to a table lock on the MySQL layer, it
  also acquires an `InnoDB` table lock. To
  avoid acquiring `InnoDB` table locks, set
  `innodb_table_locks=0`. If no
  `InnoDB` table lock is acquired,
  [`LOCK TABLES`](lock-tables.md "15.3.6 LOCK TABLES and UNLOCK TABLES Statements") completes even if
  some records of the tables are being locked by other
  transactions.

  In MySQL 8.0,
  [`innodb_table_locks=0`](innodb-parameters.md#sysvar_innodb_table_locks) has no
  effect for tables locked explicitly with
  [`LOCK TABLES ...
  WRITE`](lock-tables.md "15.3.6 LOCK TABLES and UNLOCK TABLES Statements"). It does have an effect for tables locked for
  read or write by
  [`LOCK TABLES ...
  WRITE`](lock-tables.md "15.3.6 LOCK TABLES and UNLOCK TABLES Statements") implicitly (for example, through triggers) or
  by [`LOCK TABLES
  ... READ`](lock-tables.md "15.3.6 LOCK TABLES and UNLOCK TABLES Statements").
- All `InnoDB` locks held by a transaction are
  released when the transaction is committed or aborted. Thus,
  it does not make much sense to invoke
  [`LOCK TABLES`](lock-tables.md "15.3.6 LOCK TABLES and UNLOCK TABLES Statements") on
  `InnoDB` tables in
  [`autocommit=1`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_autocommit) mode because the
  acquired `InnoDB` table locks would be
  released immediately.
- You cannot lock additional tables in the middle of a
  transaction because [`LOCK TABLES`](lock-tables.md "15.3.6 LOCK TABLES and UNLOCK TABLES Statements")
  performs an implicit [`COMMIT`](commit.md "15.3.1 START TRANSACTION, COMMIT, and ROLLBACK Statements") and
  [`UNLOCK
  TABLES`](lock-tables.md "15.3.6 LOCK TABLES and UNLOCK TABLES Statements").
