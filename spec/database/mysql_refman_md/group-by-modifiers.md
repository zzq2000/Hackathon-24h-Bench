### 14.19.2 GROUP BY Modifiers

The `GROUP BY` clause permits a `WITH
ROLLUP` modifier that causes summary output to include
extra rows that represent higher-level (that is,
super-aggregate) summary operations. `ROLLUP`
thus enables you to answer questions at multiple levels of
analysis with a single query. For example,
`ROLLUP` can be used to provide support for
OLAP (Online Analytical Processing) operations.

Suppose that a `sales` table has
`year`, `country`,
`product`, and `profit`
columns for recording sales profitability:

```sql
CREATE TABLE sales
(
    year    INT,
    country VARCHAR(20),
    product VARCHAR(32),
    profit  INT
);
```

To summarize table contents per year, use a simple
`GROUP BY` like this:

```sql
mysql> SELECT year, SUM(profit) AS profit
       FROM sales
       GROUP BY year;
+------+--------+
| year | profit |
+------+--------+
| 2000 |   4525 |
| 2001 |   3010 |
+------+--------+
```

The output shows the total (aggregate) profit for each year. To
also determine the total profit summed over all years, you must
add up the individual values yourself or run an additional
query. Or you can use `ROLLUP`, which provides
both levels of analysis with a single query. Adding a
`WITH ROLLUP` modifier to the `GROUP
BY` clause causes the query to produce another
(super-aggregate) row that shows the grand total over all year
values:

```sql
mysql> SELECT year, SUM(profit) AS profit
       FROM sales
       GROUP BY year WITH ROLLUP;
+------+--------+
| year | profit |
+------+--------+
| 2000 |   4525 |
| 2001 |   3010 |
| NULL |   7535 |
+------+--------+
```

The `NULL` value in the `year`
column identifies the grand total super-aggregate line.

`ROLLUP` has a more complex effect when there
are multiple `GROUP BY` columns. In this case,
each time there is a change in value in any but the last
grouping column, the query produces an extra super-aggregate
summary row.

For example, without `ROLLUP`, a summary of the
`sales` table based on `year`,
`country`, and `product` might
look like this, where the output indicates summary values only
at the year/country/product level of analysis:

```sql
mysql> SELECT year, country, product, SUM(profit) AS profit
       FROM sales
       GROUP BY year, country, product;
+------+---------+------------+--------+
| year | country | product    | profit |
+------+---------+------------+--------+
| 2000 | Finland | Computer   |   1500 |
| 2000 | Finland | Phone      |    100 |
| 2000 | India   | Calculator |    150 |
| 2000 | India   | Computer   |   1200 |
| 2000 | USA     | Calculator |     75 |
| 2000 | USA     | Computer   |   1500 |
| 2001 | Finland | Phone      |     10 |
| 2001 | USA     | Calculator |     50 |
| 2001 | USA     | Computer   |   2700 |
| 2001 | USA     | TV         |    250 |
+------+---------+------------+--------+
```

With `ROLLUP` added, the query produces several
extra rows:

```sql
mysql> SELECT year, country, product, SUM(profit) AS profit
       FROM sales
       GROUP BY year, country, product WITH ROLLUP;
+------+---------+------------+--------+
| year | country | product    | profit |
+------+---------+------------+--------+
| 2000 | Finland | Computer   |   1500 |
| 2000 | Finland | Phone      |    100 |
| 2000 | Finland | NULL       |   1600 |
| 2000 | India   | Calculator |    150 |
| 2000 | India   | Computer   |   1200 |
| 2000 | India   | NULL       |   1350 |
| 2000 | USA     | Calculator |     75 |
| 2000 | USA     | Computer   |   1500 |
| 2000 | USA     | NULL       |   1575 |
| 2000 | NULL    | NULL       |   4525 |
| 2001 | Finland | Phone      |     10 |
| 2001 | Finland | NULL       |     10 |
| 2001 | USA     | Calculator |     50 |
| 2001 | USA     | Computer   |   2700 |
| 2001 | USA     | TV         |    250 |
| 2001 | USA     | NULL       |   3000 |
| 2001 | NULL    | NULL       |   3010 |
| NULL | NULL    | NULL       |   7535 |
+------+---------+------------+--------+
```

Now the output includes summary information at four levels of
analysis, not just one:

- Following each set of product rows for a given year and
  country, an extra super-aggregate summary row appears
  showing the total for all products. These rows have the
  `product` column set to
  `NULL`.
- Following each set of rows for a given year, an extra
  super-aggregate summary row appears showing the total for
  all countries and products. These rows have the
  `country` and `products`
  columns set to `NULL`.
- Finally, following all other rows, an extra super-aggregate
  summary row appears showing the grand total for all years,
  countries, and products. This row has the
  `year`, `country`, and
  `products` columns set to
  `NULL`.

The `NULL` indicators in each super-aggregate
row are produced when the row is sent to the client. The server
looks at the columns named in the `GROUP BY`
clause following the leftmost one that has changed value. For
any column in the result set with a name that matches any of
those names, its value is set to `NULL`. (If
you specify grouping columns by column position, the server
identifies which columns to set to `NULL` by
position.)

Because the `NULL` values in the
super-aggregate rows are placed into the result set at such a
late stage in query processing, you can test them as
`NULL` values only in the select list or
`HAVING` clause. You cannot test them as
`NULL` values in join conditions or the
`WHERE` clause to determine which rows to
select. For example, you cannot add `WHERE product IS
NULL` to the query to eliminate from the output all but
the super-aggregate rows.

The `NULL` values do appear as
`NULL` on the client side and can be tested as
such using any MySQL client programming interface. However, at
this point, you cannot distinguish whether a
`NULL` represents a regular grouped value or a
super-aggregate value. To test the distinction, use the
[`GROUPING()`](miscellaneous-functions.md#function_grouping) function, described
later.

Previously, MySQL did not allow the use of
`DISTINCT` or `ORDER BY` in a
query having a `WITH ROLLUP` option. This
restriction is lifted in MySQL 8.0.12 and later. (Bug #87450,
Bug #86311, Bug #26640100, Bug #26073513)

For `GROUP BY ... WITH ROLLUP` queries, to test
whether `NULL` values in the result represent
super-aggregate values, the
[`GROUPING()`](miscellaneous-functions.md#function_grouping) function is available
for use in the select list, `HAVING` clause,
and (as of MySQL 8.0.12) `ORDER BY` clause. For
example, [`GROUPING(year)`](miscellaneous-functions.md#function_grouping) returns 1
when `NULL` in the `year`
column occurs in a super-aggregate row, and 0 otherwise.
Similarly, [`GROUPING(country)`](miscellaneous-functions.md#function_grouping) and
[`GROUPING(product)`](miscellaneous-functions.md#function_grouping) return 1 for
super-aggregate `NULL` values in the
`country` and `product`
columns, respectively:

```sql
mysql> SELECT
         year, country, product, SUM(profit) AS profit,
         GROUPING(year) AS grp_year,
         GROUPING(country) AS grp_country,
         GROUPING(product) AS grp_product
       FROM sales
       GROUP BY year, country, product WITH ROLLUP;
+------+---------+------------+--------+----------+-------------+-------------+
| year | country | product    | profit | grp_year | grp_country | grp_product |
+------+---------+------------+--------+----------+-------------+-------------+

+------+---------+------------+--------+----------+-------------+-------------+
```

Instead of displaying the
[`GROUPING()`](miscellaneous-functions.md#function_grouping) results directly, you
can use [`GROUPING()`](miscellaneous-functions.md#function_grouping) to substitute
labels for super-aggregate `NULL` values:

```sql
mysql> SELECT
         IF(GROUPING(year), 'All years', year) AS year,
         IF(GROUPING(country), 'All countries', country) AS country,
         IF(GROUPING(product), 'All products', product) AS product,
         SUM(profit) AS profit
       FROM sales
       GROUP BY year, country, product WITH ROLLUP;
+-----------+---------------+--------------+--------+
| year      | country       | product      | profit |
+-----------+---------------+--------------+--------+
| 2000      | Finland       | Computer     |   1500 |
| 2000      | Finland       | Phone        |    100 |
| 2000      | Finland       | All products |   1600 |
| 2000      | India         | Calculator   |    150 |
| 2000      | India         | Computer     |   1200 |
| 2000      | India         | All products |   1350 |
| 2000      | USA           | Calculator   |     75 |
| 2000      | USA           | Computer     |   1500 |
| 2000      | USA           | All products |   1575 |
| 2000      | All countries | All products |   4525 |
| 2001      | Finland       | Phone        |     10 |
| 2001      | Finland       | All products |     10 |
| 2001      | USA           | Calculator   |     50 |
| 2001      | USA           | Computer     |   2700 |
| 2001      | USA           | TV           |    250 |
| 2001      | USA           | All products |   3000 |
| 2001      | All countries | All products |   3010 |
| All years | All countries | All products |   7535 |
+-----------+---------------+--------------+--------+
```

With multiple expression arguments,
[`GROUPING()`](miscellaneous-functions.md#function_grouping) returns a result
representing a bitmask that combines the results for each
expression, with the lowest-order bit corresponding to the
result for the rightmost expression. For example,
[`GROUPING(year, country, product)`](miscellaneous-functions.md#function_grouping)
is evaluated like this:

```clike
  result for GROUPING(product)
+ result for GROUPING(country) << 1
+ result for GROUPING(year) << 2
```

The result of such a [`GROUPING()`](miscellaneous-functions.md#function_grouping)
is nonzero if any of the expressions represents a
super-aggregate `NULL`, so you can return only
the super-aggregate rows and filter out the regular grouped rows
like this:

```sql
mysql> SELECT year, country, product, SUM(profit) AS profit
       FROM sales
       GROUP BY year, country, product WITH ROLLUP
       HAVING GROUPING(year, country, product) <> 0;
+------+---------+---------+--------+
| year | country | product | profit |
+------+---------+---------+--------+
| 2000 | Finland | NULL    |   1600 |
| 2000 | India   | NULL    |   1350 |
| 2000 | USA     | NULL    |   1575 |
| 2000 | NULL    | NULL    |   4525 |
| 2001 | Finland | NULL    |     10 |
| 2001 | USA     | NULL    |   3000 |
| 2001 | NULL    | NULL    |   3010 |
| NULL | NULL    | NULL    |   7535 |
+------+---------+---------+--------+
```

The `sales` table contains no
`NULL` values, so all `NULL`
values in a `ROLLUP` result represent
super-aggregate values. When the data set contains
`NULL` values, `ROLLUP`
summaries may contain `NULL` values not only in
super-aggregate rows, but also in regular grouped rows.
[`GROUPING()`](miscellaneous-functions.md#function_grouping) enables these to be
distinguished. Suppose that table `t1` contains
a simple data set with two grouping factors for a set of
quantity values, where `NULL` indicates
something like “other” or “unknown”:

```sql
mysql> SELECT * FROM t1;
+------+-------+----------+
| name | size  | quantity |
+------+-------+----------+
| ball | small |       10 |
| ball | large |       20 |
| ball | NULL  |        5 |
| hoop | small |       15 |
| hoop | large |        5 |
| hoop | NULL  |        3 |
+------+-------+----------+
```

A simple `ROLLUP` operation produces these
results, in which it is not so easy to distinguish
`NULL` values in super-aggregate rows from
`NULL` values in regular grouped rows:

```sql
mysql> SELECT name, size, SUM(quantity) AS quantity
       FROM t1
       GROUP BY name, size WITH ROLLUP;
+------+-------+----------+
| name | size  | quantity |
+------+-------+----------+
| ball | NULL  |        5 |
| ball | large |       20 |
| ball | small |       10 |
| ball | NULL  |       35 |
| hoop | NULL  |        3 |
| hoop | large |        5 |
| hoop | small |       15 |
| hoop | NULL  |       23 |
| NULL | NULL  |       58 |
+------+-------+----------+
```

Using [`GROUPING()`](miscellaneous-functions.md#function_grouping) to substitute
labels for the super-aggregate `NULL` values
makes the result easier to interpret:

```sql
mysql> SELECT
         IF(GROUPING(name) = 1, 'All items', name) AS name,
         IF(GROUPING(size) = 1, 'All sizes', size) AS size,
         SUM(quantity) AS quantity
       FROM t1
       GROUP BY name, size WITH ROLLUP;
+-----------+-----------+----------+
| name      | size      | quantity |
+-----------+-----------+----------+
| ball      | NULL      |        5 |
| ball      | large     |       20 |
| ball      | small     |       10 |
| ball      | All sizes |       35 |
| hoop      | NULL      |        3 |
| hoop      | large     |        5 |
| hoop      | small     |       15 |
| hoop      | All sizes |       23 |
| All items | All sizes |       58 |
+-----------+-----------+----------+
```

#### Other Considerations When using ROLLUP

The following discussion lists some behaviors specific to the
MySQL implementation of `ROLLUP`.

Prior to MySQL 8.0.12, when you use `ROLLUP`,
you cannot also use an `ORDER BY` clause to
sort the results. In other words, `ROLLUP`
and `ORDER BY` were mutually exclusive in
MySQL. However, you still have some control over sort order.
To work around the restriction that prevents using
`ROLLUP` with `ORDER BY` and
achieve a specific sort order of grouped results, generate the
grouped result set as a derived table and apply `ORDER
BY` to it. For example:

```sql
mysql> SELECT * FROM
         (SELECT year, SUM(profit) AS profit
         FROM sales GROUP BY year WITH ROLLUP) AS dt
       ORDER BY year DESC;
+------+--------+
| year | profit |
+------+--------+
| 2001 |   3010 |
| 2000 |   4525 |
| NULL |   7535 |
+------+--------+
```

As of MySQL 8.0.12, `ORDER BY` and
`ROLLUP` can be used together, which enables
the use of `ORDER BY` and
[`GROUPING()`](miscellaneous-functions.md#function_grouping) to achieve a
specific sort order of grouped results. For example:

```sql
mysql> SELECT year, SUM(profit) AS profit
       FROM sales
       GROUP BY year WITH ROLLUP
       ORDER BY GROUPING(year) DESC;
+------+--------+
| year | profit |
+------+--------+
| NULL |   7535 |
| 2000 |   4525 |
| 2001 |   3010 |
+------+--------+
```

In both cases, the super-aggregate summary rows sort with the
rows from which they are calculated, and their placement
depends on sort order (at the end for ascending sort, at the
beginning for descending sort).

`LIMIT` can be used to restrict the number of
rows returned to the client. `LIMIT` is
applied after `ROLLUP`, so the limit applies
against the extra rows added by `ROLLUP`. For
example:

```sql
mysql> SELECT year, country, product, SUM(profit) AS profit
       FROM sales
       GROUP BY year, country, product WITH ROLLUP
       LIMIT 5;
+------+---------+------------+--------+
| year | country | product    | profit |
+------+---------+------------+--------+
| 2000 | Finland | Computer   |   1500 |
| 2000 | Finland | Phone      |    100 |
| 2000 | Finland | NULL       |   1600 |
| 2000 | India   | Calculator |    150 |
| 2000 | India   | Computer   |   1200 |
+------+---------+------------+--------+
```

Using `LIMIT` with `ROLLUP`
may produce results that are more difficult to interpret,
because there is less context for understanding the
super-aggregate rows.

A MySQL extension permits a column that does not appear in the
`GROUP BY` list to be named in the select
list. (For information about nonaggregated columns and
`GROUP BY`, see
[Section 14.19.3, “MySQL Handling of GROUP BY”](group-by-handling.md "14.19.3 MySQL Handling of GROUP BY").) In this case, the server
is free to choose any value from this nonaggregated column in
summary rows, and this includes the extra rows added by
`WITH ROLLUP`. For example, in the following
query, `country` is a nonaggregated column
that does not appear in the `GROUP BY` list
and values chosen for this column are nondeterministic:

```sql
mysql> SELECT year, country, SUM(profit) AS profit
       FROM sales
       GROUP BY year WITH ROLLUP;
+------+---------+--------+
| year | country | profit |
+------+---------+--------+
| 2000 | India   |   4525 |
| 2001 | USA     |   3010 |
| NULL | USA     |   7535 |
+------+---------+--------+
```

This behavior is permitted when the
[`ONLY_FULL_GROUP_BY`](sql-mode.md#sqlmode_only_full_group_by) SQL mode
is not enabled. If that mode is enabled, the server rejects
the query as illegal because `country` is not
listed in the `GROUP BY` clause. With
[`ONLY_FULL_GROUP_BY`](sql-mode.md#sqlmode_only_full_group_by) enabled,
you can still execute the query by using the
[`ANY_VALUE()`](miscellaneous-functions.md#function_any-value) function for
nondeterministic-value columns:

```sql
mysql> SELECT year, ANY_VALUE(country) AS country, SUM(profit) AS profit
       FROM sales
       GROUP BY year WITH ROLLUP;
+------+---------+--------+
| year | country | profit |
+------+---------+--------+
| 2000 | India   |   4525 |
| 2001 | USA     |   3010 |
| NULL | USA     |   7535 |
+------+---------+--------+
```

In MySQL 8.0.28 and later, a rollup column cannot be used as
an argument to [`MATCH()`](fulltext-search.md#function_match) (and is
rejected with an error) except when called in a
`WHERE` clause. See
[Section 14.9, “Full-Text Search Functions”](fulltext-search.md "14.9 Full-Text Search Functions"), for more information.
