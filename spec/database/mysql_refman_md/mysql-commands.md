#### 6.5.1.2 mysql Client Commands

[**mysql**](mysql.md "6.5.1 mysql — The MySQL Command-Line Client") sends each SQL statement that you issue
to the server to be executed. There is also a set of commands
that [**mysql**](mysql.md "6.5.1 mysql — The MySQL Command-Line Client") itself interprets. For a list of
these commands, type `help` or
`\h` at the `mysql>`
prompt:

```none
mysql> help

List of all MySQL commands:

```

If [**mysql**](mysql.md "6.5.1 mysql — The MySQL Command-Line Client") is invoked with the
[`--binary-mode`](mysql-command-options.md#option_mysql_binary-mode) option, all
[**mysql**](mysql.md "6.5.1 mysql — The MySQL Command-Line Client") commands are disabled except
`charset` and `delimiter` in
noninteractive mode (for input piped to [**mysql**](mysql.md "6.5.1 mysql — The MySQL Command-Line Client")
or loaded using the `source` command).
Beginning with MySQL 8.0.43, the
[`--commands`](mysql-command-options.md#option_mysql_commands) option can be used to
enable or disable all commands except `/C`,
`delimiter`, and `use`.

Each command has both a long and short form. The long form is
not case-sensitive; the short form is. The long form can be
followed by an optional semicolon terminator, but the short form
should not.

The use of short-form commands within multiple-line `/*
... */` comments is not supported. Short-form commands
do work within single-line `/*! ... */` version
comments, as do `/*+ ... */` optimizer-hint
comments, which are stored in object definitions. If there is a
concern that optimizer-hint comments may be stored in object
definitions so that dump files when reloaded with
`mysql` would result in execution of such
commands, either invoke [**mysql**](mysql.md "6.5.1 mysql — The MySQL Command-Line Client") with the
[`--binary-mode`](mysql-command-options.md#option_mysql_binary-mode) option or use a
reload client other than [**mysql**](mysql.md "6.5.1 mysql — The MySQL Command-Line Client").

- `help [arg]`,
  `\h [arg]`,
  `\? [arg]`,
  `? [arg]`

  Display a help message listing the available
  [**mysql**](mysql.md "6.5.1 mysql — The MySQL Command-Line Client") commands.

  If you provide an argument to the `help`
  command, [**mysql**](mysql.md "6.5.1 mysql — The MySQL Command-Line Client") uses it as a search string
  to access server-side help from the contents of the MySQL
  Reference Manual. For more information, see
  [Section 6.5.1.4, “mysql Client Server-Side Help”](mysql-server-side-help.md "6.5.1.4 mysql Client Server-Side Help").
- `charset
  charset_name`,
  `\C
  charset_name`

  Change the default character set and issue a
  [`SET NAMES`](set-names.md "15.7.6.3 SET NAMES Statement") statement. This
  enables the character set to remain synchronized on the
  client and server if [**mysql**](mysql.md "6.5.1 mysql — The MySQL Command-Line Client") is run with
  auto-reconnect enabled (which is not recommended), because
  the specified character set is used for reconnects.
- `clear`, `\c`

  Clear the current input. Use this if you change your mind
  about executing the statement that you are entering.
- `connect [db_name
  [host_name]]`,
  `\r [db_name
  [host_name]]`

  Reconnect to the server. The optional database name and host
  name arguments may be given to specify the default database
  or the host where the server is running. If omitted, the
  current values are used.

  If the `connect` command specifies a host
  name argument, that host takes precedence over any
  [`--dns-srv-name`](mysql-command-options.md#option_mysql_dns-srv-name) option given at
  [**mysql**](mysql.md "6.5.1 mysql — The MySQL Command-Line Client") startup to specify a DNS SRV
  record.
- `delimiter str`,
  `\d str`

  Change the string that [**mysql**](mysql.md "6.5.1 mysql — The MySQL Command-Line Client") interprets
  as the separator between SQL statements. The default is the
  semicolon character (`;`).

  The delimiter string can be specified as an unquoted or
  quoted argument on the `delimiter` command
  line. Quoting can be done with either single quote
  (`'`), double quote (`"`),
  or backtick (`` ` ``) characters. To include a
  quote within a quoted string, either quote the string with a
  different quote character or escape the quote with a
  backslash (`\`) character. Backslash should
  be avoided outside of quoted strings because it is the
  escape character for MySQL. For an unquoted argument, the
  delimiter is read up to the first space or end of line. For
  a quoted argument, the delimiter is read up to the matching
  quote on the line.

  [**mysql**](mysql.md "6.5.1 mysql — The MySQL Command-Line Client") interprets instances of the
  delimiter string as a statement delimiter anywhere it
  occurs, except within quoted strings. Be careful about
  defining a delimiter that might occur within other words.
  For example, if you define the delimiter as
  `X`, it is not possible to use the word
  `INDEX` in statements.
  [**mysql**](mysql.md "6.5.1 mysql — The MySQL Command-Line Client") interprets this as
  `INDE` followed by the delimiter
  `X`.

  When the delimiter recognized by [**mysql**](mysql.md "6.5.1 mysql — The MySQL Command-Line Client") is
  set to something other than the default of
  `;`, instances of that character are sent
  to the server without interpretation. However, the server
  itself still interprets `;` as a statement
  delimiter and processes statements accordingly. This
  behavior on the server side comes into play for
  multiple-statement execution (see
  [Multiple Statement Execution Support](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/c-api/8.0/en/c-api-multiple-queries.html)), and for parsing
  the body of stored procedures and functions, triggers, and
  events (see [Section 27.1, “Defining Stored Programs”](stored-programs-defining.md "27.1 Defining Stored Programs")).
- `edit`, `\e`

  Edit the current input statement. [**mysql**](mysql.md "6.5.1 mysql — The MySQL Command-Line Client")
  checks the values of the `EDITOR` and
  `VISUAL` environment variables to determine
  which editor to use. The default editor is
  **vi** if neither variable is set.

  The `edit` command works only in Unix.
- `ego`, `\G`

  Send the current statement to the server to be executed and
  display the result using vertical format.
- `exit`, `\q`

  Exit [**mysql**](mysql.md "6.5.1 mysql — The MySQL Command-Line Client").
- `go`, `\g`

  Send the current statement to the server to be executed.
- `nopager`, `\n`

  Disable output paging. See the description for
  `pager`.

  The `nopager` command works only in Unix.
- `notee`, `\t`

  Disable output copying to the tee file. See the description
  for `tee`.
- `nowarning`, `\w`

  Disable display of warnings after each statement.
- `pager
  [command]`, `\P
  [command]`

  Enable output paging. By using the
  [`--pager`](mysql-command-options.md#option_mysql_pager) option when you invoke
  [**mysql**](mysql.md "6.5.1 mysql — The MySQL Command-Line Client"), it is possible to browse or search
  query results in interactive mode with Unix programs such as
  **less**, **more**, or any
  other similar program. If you specify no value for the
  option, [**mysql**](mysql.md "6.5.1 mysql — The MySQL Command-Line Client") checks the value of the
  `PAGER` environment variable and sets the
  pager to that. Pager functionality works only in interactive
  mode.

  Output paging can be enabled interactively with the
  `pager` command and disabled with
  `nopager`. The command takes an optional
  argument; if given, the paging program is set to that. With
  no argument, the pager is set to the pager that was set on
  the command line, or `stdout` if no pager
  was specified.

  Output paging works only in Unix because it uses the
  `popen()` function, which does not exist on
  Windows. For Windows, the `tee` option can
  be used instead to save query output, although it is not as
  convenient as `pager` for browsing output
  in some situations.
- `print`, `\p`

  Print the current input statement without executing it.
- `prompt [str]`,
  `\R [str]`

  Reconfigure the [**mysql**](mysql.md "6.5.1 mysql — The MySQL Command-Line Client") prompt to the given
  string. The special character sequences that can be used in
  the prompt are described later in this section.

  If you specify the `prompt` command with no
  argument, [**mysql**](mysql.md "6.5.1 mysql — The MySQL Command-Line Client") resets the prompt to the
  default of `mysql>`.
- `query_attributes name
  value
  [name
  value ...]`

  Define query attributes that apply to the next query sent to
  the server. For discussion of the purpose and use of query
  attributes, see [Section 11.6, “Query Attributes”](query-attributes.md "11.6 Query Attributes").

  The `query_attributes` command follows
  these rules:

  - The format and quoting rules for attribute names and
    values are the same as for the
    `delimiter` command.
  - The command permits up to 32 attribute name/value pairs.
    Names and values may be up to 1024 characters long. If a
    name is given without a value, an error occurs.
  - If multiple `query_attributes` commands
    are issued prior to query execution, only the last
    command applies. After sending the query,
    [**mysql**](mysql.md "6.5.1 mysql — The MySQL Command-Line Client") clears the attribute set.
  - If multiple attributes are defined with the same name,
    attempts to retrieve the attribute value have an
    undefined result.
  - An attribute defined with an empty name cannot be
    retrieved by name.
  - If a reconnect occurs while [**mysql**](mysql.md "6.5.1 mysql — The MySQL Command-Line Client")
    executes the query, [**mysql**](mysql.md "6.5.1 mysql — The MySQL Command-Line Client") restores
    the attributes after reconnecting so the query can be
    executed again with the same attributes.
- `quit`, `\q`

  Exit [**mysql**](mysql.md "6.5.1 mysql — The MySQL Command-Line Client").
- `rehash`, `\#`

  Rebuild the completion hash that enables database, table,
  and column name completion while you are entering
  statements. (See the description for the
  [`--auto-rehash`](mysql-command-options.md#option_mysql_auto-rehash) option.)
- `resetconnection`, `\x`

  Reset the connection to clear the session state. This
  includes clearing any current query attributes defined using
  the `query_attributes` command.

  Resetting a connection has effects similar to
  [`mysql_change_user()`](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/c-api/8.0/en/mysql-change-user.html) or an
  auto-reconnect except that the connection is not closed and
  reopened, and re-authentication is not done. See
  [mysql\_change\_user()](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/c-api/8.0/en/mysql-change-user.html), and
  [Automatic Reconnection Control](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/c-api/8.0/en/c-api-auto-reconnect.html).

  This example shows how `resetconnection`
  clears a value maintained in the session state:

  ```sql
  mysql> SELECT LAST_INSERT_ID(3);
  +-------------------+
  | LAST_INSERT_ID(3) |
  +-------------------+
  |                 3 |
  +-------------------+

  mysql> SELECT LAST_INSERT_ID();
  +------------------+
  | LAST_INSERT_ID() |
  +------------------+
  |                3 |
  +------------------+

  mysql> resetconnection;

  mysql> SELECT LAST_INSERT_ID();
  +------------------+
  | LAST_INSERT_ID() |
  +------------------+
  |                0 |
  +------------------+
  ```
- `source
  file_name`, `\.
  file_name`

  Read the named file and executes the statements contained
  therein. On Windows, specify path name separators as
  `/` or `\\`.

  Quote characters are taken as part of the file name itself.
  For best results, the name should not include space
  characters.
- `ssl_session_data_print
  [file_name]`

  Fetches, serializes, and optionally stores the session data
  of a successful connection. The optional file name and
  arguments may be given to specify the file to store
  serialized session data. If omitted, the session data is
  printed to `stdout`.

  If the MySQL session is configured for reuse, session data
  from the file is deserialized and supplied to the
  `connect` command to reconnect. When the
  session is reused successfully, the
  `status` command contains a row showing
  `SSL session reused: true` while the client
  remains reconnected to the server.
- `status`, `\s`

  Provide status information about the connection and the
  server you are using. If you are running with
  [`--safe-updates`](mysql-command-options.md#option_mysql_safe-updates) enabled,
  `status` also prints the values for the
  [**mysql**](mysql.md "6.5.1 mysql — The MySQL Command-Line Client") variables that affect your queries.
- `system
  command`, `\!
  command`

  Execute the given command using your default command
  interpreter.

  Prior to MySQL 8.0.19, the `system` command
  works only in Unix. As of 8.0.19, it also works on Windows.

  In MySQL 8.0.40 and later, this command can be disabled by
  starting the client with
  [`--system-command=OFF`](mysql-command-options.md#option_mysql_system-command) or
  [`--skip-system-command`](mysql-command-options.md#option_mysql_skip-system-command).
- `tee
  [file_name]`,
  `\T [file_name]`

  By using the [`--tee`](mysql-command-options.md#option_mysql_tee) option when
  you invoke [**mysql**](mysql.md "6.5.1 mysql — The MySQL Command-Line Client"), you can log statements
  and their output. All the data displayed on the screen is
  appended into a given file. This can be very useful for
  debugging purposes also. [**mysql**](mysql.md "6.5.1 mysql — The MySQL Command-Line Client") flushes
  results to the file after each statement, just before it
  prints its next prompt. Tee functionality works only in
  interactive mode.

  You can enable this feature interactively with the
  `tee` command. Without a parameter, the
  previous file is used. The `tee` file can
  be disabled with the `notee` command.
  Executing `tee` again re-enables logging.
- `use db_name`,
  `\u db_name`

  Use *`db_name`* as the default
  database.
- `warnings`, `\W`

  Enable display of warnings after each statement (if there
  are any).

Here are a few tips about the `pager` command:

- You can use it to write to a file and the results go only to
  the file:

  ```sql
  mysql> pager cat > /tmp/log.txt
  ```

  You can also pass any options for the program that you want
  to use as your pager:

  ```sql
  mysql> pager less -n -i -S
  ```
- In the preceding example, note the `-S`
  option. You may find it very useful for browsing wide query
  results. Sometimes a very wide result set is difficult to
  read on the screen. The `-S` option to
  **less** can make the result set much more
  readable because you can scroll it horizontally using the
  left-arrow and right-arrow keys. You can also use
  `-S` interactively within
  **less** to switch the horizontal-browse mode
  on and off. For more information, read the
  **less** manual page:

  ```terminal
  man less
  ```
- The `-F` and `-X` options may
  be used with **less** to cause it to exit if
  output fits on one screen, which is convenient when no
  scrolling is necessary:

  ```sql
  mysql> pager less -n -i -S -F -X
  ```
- You can specify very complex pager commands for handling
  query output:

  ```sql
  mysql> pager cat | tee /dr1/tmp/res.txt \
            | tee /dr2/tmp/res2.txt | less -n -i -S
  ```

  In this example, the command would send query results to two
  files in two different directories on two different file
  systems mounted on `/dr1` and
  `/dr2`, yet still display the results
  onscreen using **less**.

You can also combine the `tee` and
`pager` functions. Have a
`tee` file enabled and `pager`
set to **less**, and you are able to browse the
results using the **less** program and still have
everything appended into a file the same time. The difference
between the Unix `tee` used with the
`pager` command and the
[**mysql**](mysql.md "6.5.1 mysql — The MySQL Command-Line Client") built-in `tee` command
is that the built-in `tee` works even if you do
not have the Unix **tee** available. The built-in
`tee` also logs everything that is printed on
the screen, whereas the Unix **tee** used with
`pager` does not log quite that much.
Additionally, `tee` file logging can be turned
on and off interactively from within [**mysql**](mysql.md "6.5.1 mysql — The MySQL Command-Line Client").
This is useful when you want to log some queries to a file, but
not others.

The `prompt` command reconfigures the default
`mysql>` prompt. The string for defining the
prompt can contain the following special sequences.

| Option | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `\C` | The current connection identifier |
| `\c` | A counter that increments for each statement you issue |
| `\D` | The full current date |
| `\d` | The default database |
| `\h` | The server host |
| `\l` | The current delimiter |
| `\m` | Minutes of the current time |
| `\n` | A newline character |
| `\O` | The current month in three-letter format (Jan, Feb, …) |
| `\o` | The current month in numeric format |
| `\P` | am/pm |
| `\p` | The current TCP/IP port or socket file |
| `\R` | The current time, in 24-hour military time (0–23) |
| `\r` | The current time, standard 12-hour time (1–12) |
| `\S` | Semicolon |
| `\s` | Seconds of the current time |
| `\T` | Print an asterisk (`*`) if the current session is inside a transaction block (from MySQL 8.0.28) |
| `\t` | A tab character |
| `\U` | Your full `user_name@host_name` account name |
| `\u` | Your user name |
| `\v` | The server version |
| `\w` | The current day of the week in three-letter format (Mon, Tue, …) |
| `\Y` | The current year, four digits |
| `\y` | The current year, two digits |
| `\_` | A space |
| `\` | A space (a space follows the backslash) |
| `\'` | Single quote |
| `\"` | Double quote |
| `\\` | A literal `\` backslash character |
| `\x` | *`x`*, for any “*`x`*” not listed above |

You can set the prompt in several ways:

- *Use an environment variable.* You can
  set the `MYSQL_PS1` environment variable to
  a prompt string. For example:

  ```terminal
  export MYSQL_PS1="(\u@\h) [\d]> "
  ```
- *Use a command-line option.* You can set
  the [`--prompt`](mysql-command-options.md#option_mysql_prompt) option on the
  command line to [**mysql**](mysql.md "6.5.1 mysql — The MySQL Command-Line Client"). For example:

  ```terminal
  $> mysql --prompt="(\u@\h) [\d]> "
  (user@host) [database]>
  ```
- *Use an option file.* You can set the
  `prompt` option in the
  `[mysql]` group of any MySQL option file,
  such as `/etc/my.cnf` or the
  `.my.cnf` file in your home directory.
  For example:

  ```ini
  [mysql]
  prompt=(\\u@\\h) [\\d]>\\_
  ```

  In this example, note that the backslashes are doubled. If
  you set the prompt using the `prompt`
  option in an option file, it is advisable to double the
  backslashes when using the special prompt options. There is
  some overlap in the set of permissible prompt options and
  the set of special escape sequences that are recognized in
  option files. (The rules for escape sequences in option
  files are listed in [Section 6.2.2.2, “Using Option Files”](option-files.md "6.2.2.2 Using Option Files").) The
  overlap may cause you problems if you use single
  backslashes. For example, `\s` is
  interpreted as a space rather than as the current seconds
  value. The following example shows how to define a prompt
  within an option file to include the current time in
  `hh:mm:ss>`
  format:

  ```ini
  [mysql]
  prompt="\\r:\\m:\\s> "
  ```
- *Set the prompt interactively.* You can
  change your prompt interactively by using the
  `prompt` (or `\R`)
  command. For example:

  ```sql
  mysql> prompt (\u@\h) [\d]>\_
  PROMPT set to '(\u@\h) [\d]>\_'
  (user@host) [database]>
  (user@host) [database]> prompt
  Returning to default PROMPT of mysql>
  mysql>
  ```
