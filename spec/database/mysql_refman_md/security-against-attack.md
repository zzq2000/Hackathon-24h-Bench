### 8.1.3 Making MySQL Secure Against Attackers

When you connect to a MySQL server, you should use a password. The
password is not transmitted as cleartext over the connection.

All other information is transferred as text, and can be read by
anyone who is able to watch the connection. If the connection
between the client and the server goes through an untrusted
network, and you are concerned about this, you can use the
compressed protocol to make traffic much more difficult to
decipher. You can also use MySQL's internal SSL support to make
the connection even more secure. See
[Section 8.3, “Using Encrypted Connections”](encrypted-connections.md "8.3 Using Encrypted Connections"). Alternatively, use SSH to
get an encrypted TCP/IP connection between a MySQL server and a
MySQL client. You can find an Open Source SSH client at
<http://www.openssh.org/>, and a comparison of both
Open Source and Commercial SSH clients at
<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_SSH_clients>.

To make a MySQL system secure, you should strongly consider the
following suggestions:

- Require all MySQL accounts to have a password. A client
  program does not necessarily know the identity of the person
  running it. It is common for client/server applications that
  the user can specify any user name to the client program. For
  example, anyone can use the [**mysql**](mysql.md "6.5.1 mysql — The MySQL Command-Line Client") program
  to connect as any other person simply by invoking it as
  `mysql -u other_user
  db_name` if
  *`other_user`* has no password. If all
  accounts have a password, connecting using another user's
  account becomes much more difficult.

  For a discussion of methods for setting passwords, see
  [Section 8.2.14, “Assigning Account Passwords”](assigning-passwords.md "8.2.14 Assigning Account Passwords").
- Make sure that the only Unix user account with read or write
  privileges in the database directories is the account that is
  used for running [**mysqld**](mysqld.md "6.3.1 mysqld — The MySQL Server").
- Never run the MySQL server as the Unix `root`
  user. This is extremely dangerous, because any user with the
  [`FILE`](privileges-provided.md#priv_file) privilege is able to cause
  the server to create files as `root` (for
  example, `~root/.bashrc`). To prevent this,
  [**mysqld**](mysqld.md "6.3.1 mysqld — The MySQL Server") refuses to run as
  `root` unless that is specified explicitly
  using the [`--user=root`](server-options.md#option_mysqld_user) option.

  [**mysqld**](mysqld.md "6.3.1 mysqld — The MySQL Server") can (and should) be run as an
  ordinary, unprivileged user instead. You can create a separate
  Unix account named `mysql` to make everything
  even more secure. Use this account only for administering
  MySQL. To start [**mysqld**](mysqld.md "6.3.1 mysqld — The MySQL Server") as a different Unix
  user, add a `user` option that specifies the
  user name in the `[mysqld]` group of the
  `my.cnf` option file where you specify
  server options. For example:

  ```ini
  [mysqld]
  user=mysql
  ```

  This causes the server to start as the designated user whether
  you start it manually or by using
  [**mysqld\_safe**](mysqld-safe.md "6.3.2 mysqld_safe — MySQL Server Startup Script") or
  [**mysql.server**](mysql-server.md "6.3.3 mysql.server — MySQL Server Startup Script"). For more details, see
  [Section 8.1.5, “How to Run MySQL as a Normal User”](changing-mysql-user.md "8.1.5 How to Run MySQL as a Normal User").

  Running [**mysqld**](mysqld.md "6.3.1 mysqld — The MySQL Server") as a Unix user other than
  `root` does not mean that you need to change
  the `root` user name in the
  `user` table. *User names for MySQL
  accounts have nothing to do with user names for Unix
  accounts*.
- Do not grant the [`FILE`](privileges-provided.md#priv_file) privilege
  to nonadministrative users. Any user that has this privilege
  can write a file anywhere in the file system with the
  privileges of the [**mysqld**](mysqld.md "6.3.1 mysqld — The MySQL Server") daemon. This
  includes the server's data directory containing the files that
  implement the privilege tables. To make
  [`FILE`](privileges-provided.md#priv_file)-privilege operations a bit
  safer, files generated with
  [`SELECT ... INTO
  OUTFILE`](select-into.md "15.2.13.1 SELECT ... INTO Statement") do not overwrite existing files and are
  writable by everyone.

  The [`FILE`](privileges-provided.md#priv_file) privilege may also be
  used to read any file that is world-readable or accessible to
  the Unix user that the server runs as. With this privilege,
  you can read any file into a database table. This could be
  abused, for example, by using [`LOAD
  DATA`](load-data.md "15.2.9 LOAD DATA Statement") to load `/etc/passwd` into a
  table, which then can be displayed with
  [`SELECT`](select.md "15.2.13 SELECT Statement").

  To limit the location in which files can be read and written,
  set the [`secure_file_priv`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_secure_file_priv)
  system to a specific directory. See
  [Section 7.1.8, “Server System Variables”](server-system-variables.md "7.1.8 Server System Variables").
- Encrypt binary log files and relay log files. Encryption helps
  to protect these files and the potentially sensitive data
  contained in them from being misused by outside attackers, and
  also from unauthorized viewing by users of the operating
  system where they are stored. You enable encryption on a MySQL
  server by setting the
  [`binlog_encryption`](replication-options-binary-log.md#sysvar_binlog_encryption) system
  variable to `ON`. For more information, see
  [Section 19.3.2, “Encrypting Binary Log Files and Relay Log Files”](replication-binlog-encryption.md "19.3.2 Encrypting Binary Log Files and Relay Log Files").
- Do not grant the [`PROCESS`](privileges-provided.md#priv_process) or
  [`SUPER`](privileges-provided.md#priv_super) privilege to
  nonadministrative users. The output of [**mysqladmin
  processlist**](mysqladmin.md "6.5.2 mysqladmin — A MySQL Server Administration Program") and [`SHOW
  PROCESSLIST`](show-processlist.md "15.7.7.29 SHOW PROCESSLIST Statement") shows the text of any statements
  currently being executed, so any user who is permitted to see
  the server process list might be able to see statements issued
  by other users.

  [**mysqld**](mysqld.md "6.3.1 mysqld — The MySQL Server") reserves an extra connection for
  users who have the
  [`CONNECTION_ADMIN`](privileges-provided.md#priv_connection-admin) or
  [`SUPER`](privileges-provided.md#priv_super) privilege, so that a
  MySQL `root` user can log in and check server
  activity even if all normal connections are in use.

  The [`SUPER`](privileges-provided.md#priv_super) privilege can be used
  to terminate client connections, change server operation by
  changing the value of system variables, and control
  replication servers.
- Do not permit the use of symlinks to tables. (This capability
  can be disabled with the
  [`--skip-symbolic-links`](server-options.md#option_mysqld_symbolic-links)
  option.) This is especially important if you run
  [**mysqld**](mysqld.md "6.3.1 mysqld — The MySQL Server") as `root`, because
  anyone that has write access to the server's data directory
  then could delete any file in the system! See
  [Section 10.12.2.2, “Using Symbolic Links for MyISAM Tables on Unix”](symbolic-links-to-tables.md "10.12.2.2 Using Symbolic Links for MyISAM Tables on Unix").
- Stored programs and views should be written using the security
  guidelines discussed in
  [Section 27.6, “Stored Object Access Control”](stored-objects-security.md "27.6 Stored Object Access Control").
- If you do not trust your DNS, you should use IP addresses
  rather than host names in the grant tables. In any case, you
  should be very careful about creating grant table entries
  using host name values that contain wildcards.
- If you want to restrict the number of connections permitted to
  a single account, you can do so by setting the
  [`max_user_connections`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_max_user_connections) variable
  in [**mysqld**](mysqld.md "6.3.1 mysqld — The MySQL Server"). The [`CREATE
  USER`](create-user.md "15.7.1.3 CREATE USER Statement") and [`ALTER USER`](alter-user.md "15.7.1.1 ALTER USER Statement")
  statements also support resource control options for limiting
  the extent of server use permitted to an account. See
  [Section 15.7.1.3, “CREATE USER Statement”](create-user.md "15.7.1.3 CREATE USER Statement"), and
  [Section 15.7.1.1, “ALTER USER Statement”](alter-user.md "15.7.1.1 ALTER USER Statement").
- If the plugin directory is writable by the server, it may be
  possible for a user to write executable code to a file in the
  directory using [`SELECT
  ... INTO DUMPFILE`](select.md "15.2.13 SELECT Statement"). This can be prevented by making
  [`plugin_dir`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_plugin_dir) read only to the
  server or by setting
  [`secure_file_priv`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_secure_file_priv) to a
  directory where [`SELECT`](select.md "15.2.13 SELECT Statement") writes
  can be made safely.
