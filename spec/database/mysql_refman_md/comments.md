## 11.7 Comments

MySQL Server supports three comment styles:

- From a `#` character to the end of the line.
- From a `--` sequence to the end of the
  line. In MySQL, the `--` (double-dash)
  comment style requires the second dash to be followed by at
  least one whitespace or control character, such as a space or
  tab. This syntax differs slightly from standard SQL comment
  syntax, as discussed in [Section 1.6.2.4, “'--' as the Start of a Comment”](ansi-diff-comments.md "1.6.2.4 '--' as the Start of a Comment").
- From a `/*` sequence to the following
  `*/` sequence, as in the C programming
  language. This syntax enables a comment to extend over
  multiple lines because the beginning and closing sequences
  need not be on the same line.

The following example demonstrates all three comment styles:

```sql
mysql> SELECT 1+1;     # This comment continues to the end of line
mysql> SELECT 1+1;     -- This comment continues to the end of line
mysql> SELECT 1 /* this is an in-line comment */ + 1;
mysql> SELECT 1+
/*
this is a
multiple-line comment
*/
1;
```

Nested comments are not supported, and are deprecated; expect them
to be removed in a future MySQL release. (Under some conditions,
nested comments might be permitted, but usually are not, and users
should avoid them.)

MySQL Server supports certain variants of C-style comments. These
enable you to write code that includes MySQL extensions, but is
still portable, by using comments of the following form:

```sql
/*! MySQL-specific code */
```

In this case, MySQL Server parses and executes the code within the
comment as it would any other SQL statement, but other SQL servers
should ignore the extensions. For example, MySQL Server recognizes
the `STRAIGHT_JOIN` keyword in the following
statement, but other servers should not:

```sql
SELECT /*! STRAIGHT_JOIN */ col1 FROM table1,table2 WHERE ...
```

If you add a version number after the `!`
character, the syntax within the comment is executed only if the
MySQL version is greater than or equal to the specified version
number. The `KEY_BLOCK_SIZE` keyword in the
following comment is executed only by servers from MySQL 5.1.10 or
higher:

```sql
CREATE TABLE t1(a INT, KEY (a)) /*!50110 KEY_BLOCK_SIZE=1024 */;
```

The version number uses the format
*`Mmmrr`*, where
*`M`* is a major version,
*`mm`* is a two-digit minor version, and
*`rr`* is a two-digit release number. For
example: In a statement to be run only by a MySQL server version
8.0.31 or later, use `80031` in the comment.

The version number should be followed by at least one whitespace
character (or the end of the comment). Beginning with MySQL
8.0.34, if this condition is not met, the statement triggers a
warning
; you should expect this requirement to become strictly enforced
in a future version of MySQL.

The comment syntax just described applies to how the
[**mysqld**](mysqld.md "6.3.1 mysqld — The MySQL Server") server parses SQL statements. The
[**mysql**](mysql.md "6.5.1 mysql — The MySQL Command-Line Client") client program also performs some parsing
of statements before sending them to the server. (It does this to
determine statement boundaries within a multiple-statement input
line.) For information about differences between the server and
[**mysql**](mysql.md "6.5.1 mysql — The MySQL Command-Line Client") client parsers, see
[Section 6.5.1.6, “mysql Client Tips”](mysql-tips.md "6.5.1.6 mysql Client Tips").

Comments in `/*!12345 ... */` format are not
stored on the server. If this format is used to comment stored
programs, the comments are not retained in the program body.

Another variant of C-style comment syntax is used to specify
optimizer hints. Hint comments include a `+`
character following the `/*` comment opening
sequence. Example:

```sql
SELECT /*+ BKA(t1) */ FROM ... ;
```

For more information, see [Section 10.9.3, “Optimizer Hints”](optimizer-hints.md "10.9.3 Optimizer Hints").

The use of short-form [**mysql**](mysql.md "6.5.1 mysql — The MySQL Command-Line Client") commands such as
`\C` within multiple-line `/* ...
*/` comments is not supported. Short-form commands do
work within single-line `/*! ... */` version
comments, as do `/*+ ... */` optimizer-hint
comments, which are stored in object definitions. If there is a
concern that optimizer-hint comments may be stored in object
definitions so that dump files when reloaded with
`mysql` would result in execution of such
commands, either invoke [**mysql**](mysql.md "6.5.1 mysql — The MySQL Command-Line Client") with the
[`--binary-mode`](mysql-command-options.md#option_mysql_binary-mode) option or use a reload
client other than [**mysql**](mysql.md "6.5.1 mysql — The MySQL Command-Line Client").
