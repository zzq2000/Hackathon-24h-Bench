### 12.9.8 Converting Between 3-Byte and 4-Byte Unicode Character Sets

This section describes issues that you may face when converting
character data between the `utf8mb3` and
`utf8mb4` character sets.

Note

This discussion focuses primarily on converting between
`utf8mb3` and `utf8mb4`, but
similar principles apply to converting between the
`ucs2` character set and character sets such
as `utf16` or `utf32`.

The `utf8mb3` and `utf8mb4`
character sets differ as follows:

- `utf8mb3` supports only characters in the
  Basic Multilingual Plane (BMP). `utf8mb4`
  additionally supports supplementary characters that lie
  outside the BMP.
- `utf8mb3` uses a maximum of three bytes per
  character. `utf8mb4` uses a maximum of four
  bytes per character.

Note

This discussion refers to the `utf8mb3` and
`utf8mb4` character set names to be explicit
about referring to 3-byte and 4-byte UTF-8 character set data.

One advantage of converting from `utf8mb3` to
`utf8mb4` is that this enables applications to
use supplementary characters. One tradeoff is that this may
increase data storage space requirements.

In terms of table content, conversion from
`utf8mb3` to `utf8mb4`
presents no problems:

- For a BMP character, `utf8mb4` and
  `utf8mb3` have identical storage
  characteristics: same code values, same encoding, same
  length.
- For a supplementary character, `utf8mb4`
  requires four bytes to store it, whereas
  `utf8mb3` cannot store the character at
  all. When converting `utf8mb3` columns to
  `utf8mb4`, you need not worry about
  converting supplementary characters because there are none.

In terms of table structure, these are the primary potential
incompatibilities:

- For the variable-length character data types
  ([`VARCHAR`](char.md "13.3.2 The CHAR and VARCHAR Types") and the
  [`TEXT`](blob.md "13.3.4 The BLOB and TEXT Types") types), the maximum
  permitted length in characters is less for
  `utf8mb4` columns than for
  `utf8mb3` columns.
- For all character data types
  ([`CHAR`](char.md "13.3.2 The CHAR and VARCHAR Types"),
  [`VARCHAR`](char.md "13.3.2 The CHAR and VARCHAR Types"), and the
  [`TEXT`](blob.md "13.3.4 The BLOB and TEXT Types") types), the maximum
  number of characters that can be indexed is less for
  `utf8mb4` columns than for
  `utf8mb3` columns.

Consequently, to convert tables from `utf8mb3`
to `utf8mb4`, it may be necessary to change
some column or index definitions.

Tables can be converted from `utf8mb3` to
`utf8mb4` by using [`ALTER
TABLE`](alter-table.md "15.1.9 ALTER TABLE Statement"). Suppose that a table has this definition:

```sql
CREATE TABLE t1 (
  col1 CHAR(10) CHARACTER SET utf8mb3 COLLATE utf8mb3_unicode_ci NOT NULL,
  col2 CHAR(10) CHARACTER SET utf8mb3 COLLATE utf8mb3_bin NOT NULL
) CHARACTER SET utf8mb3;
```

The following statement converts `t1` to use
`utf8mb4`:

```sql
ALTER TABLE t1
  DEFAULT CHARACTER SET utf8mb4,
  MODIFY col1 CHAR(10)
    CHARACTER SET utf8mb4 COLLATE utf8mb4_unicode_ci NOT NULL,
  MODIFY col2 CHAR(10)
    CHARACTER SET utf8mb4 COLLATE utf8mb4_bin NOT NULL;
```

The catch when converting from `utf8mb3` to
`utf8mb4` is that the maximum length of a
column or index key is unchanged in terms of
*bytes*. Therefore, it is smaller in terms of
*characters* because the maximum length of a
character is four bytes instead of three. For the
[`CHAR`](char.md "13.3.2 The CHAR and VARCHAR Types"),
[`VARCHAR`](char.md "13.3.2 The CHAR and VARCHAR Types"), and
[`TEXT`](blob.md "13.3.4 The BLOB and TEXT Types") data types, watch for these
issues when converting your MySQL tables:

- Check all definitions of `utf8mb3` columns
  and make sure they do not exceed the maximum length for the
  storage engine.
- Check all indexes on `utf8mb3` columns and
  make sure they do not exceed the maximum length for the
  storage engine. Sometimes the maximum can change due to
  storage engine enhancements.

If the preceding conditions apply, you must either reduce the
defined length of columns or indexes, or continue to use
`utf8mb3` rather than
`utf8mb4`.

Here are some examples where structural changes may be needed:

- A [`TINYTEXT`](blob.md "13.3.4 The BLOB and TEXT Types") column can hold up
  to 255 bytes, so it can hold up to 85 3-byte or 63 4-byte
  characters. Suppose that you have a
  [`TINYTEXT`](blob.md "13.3.4 The BLOB and TEXT Types") column that uses
  `utf8mb3` but must be able to contain more
  than 63 characters. You cannot convert it to
  `utf8mb4` unless you also change the data
  type to a longer type such as
  [`TEXT`](blob.md "13.3.4 The BLOB and TEXT Types").

  Similarly, a very long
  [`VARCHAR`](char.md "13.3.2 The CHAR and VARCHAR Types") column may need to be
  changed to one of the longer
  [`TEXT`](blob.md "13.3.4 The BLOB and TEXT Types") types if you want to
  convert it from `utf8mb3` to
  `utf8mb4`.
- `InnoDB` has a maximum index length of 767
  bytes for tables that use
  `COMPACT`
  or
  `REDUNDANT`
  row format, so for `utf8mb3` or
  `utf8mb4` columns, you can index a maximum
  of 255 or 191 characters, respectively. If you currently
  have `utf8mb3` columns with indexes longer
  than 191 characters, you must index a smaller number of
  characters.

  In an `InnoDB` table that uses
  `COMPACT`
  or
  `REDUNDANT`
  row format, these column and index definitions are legal:

  ```sql
  col1 VARCHAR(500) CHARACTER SET utf8mb3, INDEX (col1(255))
  ```

  To use `utf8mb4` instead, the index must be
  smaller:

  ```sql
  col1 VARCHAR(500) CHARACTER SET utf8mb4, INDEX (col1(191))
  ```

  Note

  For `InnoDB` tables that use
  `COMPRESSED`
  or
  `DYNAMIC`
  row format, [index key
  prefixes](glossary.md#glos_index_prefix "index prefix") longer than 767 bytes (up to 3072 bytes)
  are permitted. Tables created with these row formats
  enable you to index a maximum of 1024 or 768 characters
  for `utf8mb3` or
  `utf8mb4` columns, respectively. For
  related information, see [Section 17.22, “InnoDB Limits”](innodb-limits.md "17.22 InnoDB Limits"),
  and [DYNAMIC Row Format](innodb-row-format.md#innodb-row-format-dynamic "DYNAMIC Row Format").

The preceding types of changes are most likely to be required
only if you have very long columns or indexes. Otherwise, you
should be able to convert your tables from
`utf8mb3` to `utf8mb4` without
problems, using [`ALTER TABLE`](alter-table.md "15.1.9 ALTER TABLE Statement") as
described previously.

The following items summarize other potential incompatibilities:

- `SET NAMES 'utf8mb4'` causes use of the
  4-byte character set for connection character sets. As long
  as no 4-byte characters are sent from the server, there
  should be no problems. Otherwise, applications that expect
  to receive a maximum of three bytes per character may have
  problems. Conversely, applications that expect to send
  4-byte characters must ensure that the server understands
  them.
- For replication, if character sets that support
  supplementary characters are to be used on the source, all
  replicas must understand them as well.

  Also, keep in mind the general principle that if a table has
  different definitions on the source and replica, this can
  lead to unexpected results. For example, the differences in
  maximum index key length make it risky to use
  `utf8mb3` on the source and
  `utf8mb4` on the replica.

If you have converted to `utf8mb4`,
`utf16`, `utf16le`, or
`utf32`, and then decide to convert back to
`utf8mb3` or `ucs2` (for
example, to downgrade to an older version of MySQL), these
considerations apply:

- `utf8mb3` and `ucs2` data
  should present no problems.
- The server must be recent enough to recognize definitions
  referring to the character set from which you are
  converting.
- For object definitions that refer to the
  `utf8mb4` character set, you can dump them
  with [**mysqldump**](mysqldump.md "6.5.4 mysqldump — A Database Backup Program") prior to downgrading, edit
  the dump file to change instances of
  `utf8mb4` to `utf8`, and
  reload the file in the older server, as long as there are no
  4-byte characters in the data. The older server sees
  `utf8` in the dump file object definitions
  and create new objects that use the (3-byte)
  `utf8` character set.
