### 8.3.3 Creating SSL and RSA Certificates and Keys

[8.3.3.3 Creating RSA Keys Using openssl](creating-rsa-files-using-openssl.md)

The following discussion describes how to create the files
required for SSL and RSA support in MySQL. File creation can be
performed using facilities provided by MySQL itself, or by
invoking the **openssl** command directly.

SSL certificate and key files enable MySQL to support encrypted
connections using SSL. See
[Section 8.3.1, “Configuring MySQL to Use Encrypted Connections”](using-encrypted-connections.md "8.3.1 Configuring MySQL to Use Encrypted Connections").

RSA key files enable MySQL to support secure password exchange
over unencrypted connections for accounts authenticated by the
`sha256_password` or
`caching_sha2_password` plugin. See
[Section 8.4.1.3, “SHA-256 Pluggable Authentication”](sha256-pluggable-authentication.md "8.4.1.3 SHA-256 Pluggable Authentication"), and
[Section 8.4.1.2, “Caching SHA-2 Pluggable Authentication”](caching-sha2-pluggable-authentication.md "8.4.1.2 Caching SHA-2 Pluggable Authentication").
