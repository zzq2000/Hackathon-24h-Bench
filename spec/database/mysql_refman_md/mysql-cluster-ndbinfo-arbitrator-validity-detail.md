#### 25.6.16.1 The ndbinfo arbitrator\_validity\_detail Table

The `arbitrator_validity_detail` table shows
the view that each data node in the cluster has of the
arbitrator. It is a subset of the
[`membership`](mysql-cluster-ndbinfo-membership.md "25.6.16.44 The ndbinfo membership Table") table.

The `arbitrator_validity_detail` table contains
the following columns:

- `node_id`

  This node's node ID
- `arbitrator`

  Node ID of arbitrator
- `arb_ticket`

  Internal identifier used to track arbitration
- `arb_connected`

  Whether this node is connected to the arbitrator; either of
  `Yes` or `No`
- `arb_state`

  Arbitration state

##### Notes

The node ID is the same as that reported by [**ndb\_mgm -e
"SHOW"**](mysql-cluster-programs-ndb-mgm.md "25.5.5 ndb_mgm — The NDB Cluster Management Client").

All nodes should show the same `arbitrator` and
`arb_ticket` values as well as the same
`arb_state` value. Possible
`arb_state` values are
`ARBIT_NULL`, `ARBIT_INIT`,
`ARBIT_FIND`, `ARBIT_PREP1`,
`ARBIT_PREP2`, `ARBIT_START`,
`ARBIT_RUN`, `ARBIT_CHOOSE`,
`ARBIT_CRASH`, and `UNKNOWN`.

`arb_connected` shows whether the current node
is connected to the `arbitrator`.
