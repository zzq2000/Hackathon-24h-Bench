#### 29.12.6.1 The events\_statements\_current Table

The [`events_statements_current`](performance-schema-events-statements-current-table.md "29.12.6.1 The events_statements_current Table")
table contains current statement events. The table stores one
row per thread showing the current status of the thread's most
recent monitored statement event, so there is no system
variable for configuring the table size.

Of the tables that contain statement event rows,
[`events_statements_current`](performance-schema-events-statements-current-table.md "29.12.6.1 The events_statements_current Table") is the
most fundamental. Other tables that contain statement event
rows are logically derived from the current events. For
example, the
[`events_statements_history`](performance-schema-events-statements-history-table.md "29.12.6.2 The events_statements_history Table") and
[`events_statements_history_long`](performance-schema-events-statements-history-long-table.md "29.12.6.3 The events_statements_history_long Table")
tables are collections of the most recent statement events
that have ended, up to a maximum number of rows per thread and
globally across all threads, respectively.

For more information about the relationship between the three
`events_statements_xxx`
event tables, see
[Section 29.9, “Performance Schema Tables for Current and Historical Events”](performance-schema-event-tables.md "29.9 Performance Schema Tables for Current and Historical Events").

For information about configuring whether to collect statement
events, see
[Section 29.12.6, “Performance Schema Statement Event Tables”](performance-schema-statement-tables.md "29.12.6 Performance Schema Statement Event Tables").

The [`events_statements_current`](performance-schema-events-statements-current-table.md "29.12.6.1 The events_statements_current Table")
table has these columns:

- `THREAD_ID`, `EVENT_ID`

  The thread associated with the event and the thread
  current event number when the event starts. The
  `THREAD_ID` and
  `EVENT_ID` values taken together uniquely
  identify the row. No two rows have the same pair of
  values.
- `END_EVENT_ID`

  This column is set to `NULL` when the
  event starts and updated to the thread current event
  number when the event ends.
- `EVENT_NAME`

  The name of the instrument from which the event was
  collected. This is a `NAME` value from
  the [`setup_instruments`](performance-schema-setup-instruments-table.md "29.12.2.3 The setup_instruments Table") table.
  Instrument names may have multiple parts and form a
  hierarchy, as discussed in
  [Section 29.6, “Performance Schema Instrument Naming Conventions”](performance-schema-instrument-naming.md "29.6 Performance Schema Instrument Naming Conventions").

  For SQL statements, the `EVENT_NAME`
  value initially is `statement/com/Query`
  until the statement is parsed, then changes to a more
  appropriate value, as described in
  [Section 29.12.6, “Performance Schema Statement Event Tables”](performance-schema-statement-tables.md "29.12.6 Performance Schema Statement Event Tables").
- `SOURCE`

  The name of the source file containing the instrumented
  code that produced the event and the line number in the
  file at which the instrumentation occurs. This enables you
  to check the source to determine exactly what code is
  involved.
- `TIMER_START`,
  `TIMER_END`,
  `TIMER_WAIT`

  Timing information for the event. The unit for these
  values is picoseconds (trillionths of a second). The
  `TIMER_START` and
  `TIMER_END` values indicate when event
  timing started and ended. `TIMER_WAIT` is
  the event elapsed time (duration).

  If an event has not finished, `TIMER_END`
  is the current timer value and
  `TIMER_WAIT` is the time elapsed so far
  (`TIMER_END` −
  `TIMER_START`).

  If an event is produced from an instrument that has
  `TIMED = NO`, timing information is not
  collected, and `TIMER_START`,
  `TIMER_END`, and
  `TIMER_WAIT` are all
  `NULL`.

  For discussion of picoseconds as the unit for event times
  and factors that affect time values, see
  [Section 29.4.1, “Performance Schema Event Timing”](performance-schema-timing.md "29.4.1 Performance Schema Event Timing").
- `LOCK_TIME`

  The time spent waiting for table locks. This value is
  computed in microseconds but normalized to picoseconds for
  easier comparison with other Performance Schema timers.
- `SQL_TEXT`

  The text of the SQL statement. For a command not
  associated with an SQL statement, the value is
  `NULL`.

  The maximum space available for statement display is 1024
  bytes by default. To change this value, set the
  [`performance_schema_max_sql_text_length`](performance-schema-system-variables.md#sysvar_performance_schema_max_sql_text_length)
  system variable at server startup. (Changing this value
  affects columns in other Performance Schema tables as
  well. See
  [Section 29.10, “Performance Schema Statement Digests and Sampling”](performance-schema-statement-digests.md "29.10 Performance Schema Statement Digests and Sampling").)
- `DIGEST`

  The statement digest SHA-256 value as a string of 64
  hexadecimal characters, or `NULL` if the
  `statements_digest` consumer is
  `no`. For more information about
  statement digesting, see
  [Section 29.10, “Performance Schema Statement Digests and Sampling”](performance-schema-statement-digests.md "29.10 Performance Schema Statement Digests and Sampling").
- `DIGEST_TEXT`

  The normalized statement digest text, or
  `NULL` if the
  `statements_digest` consumer is
  `no`. For more information about
  statement digesting, see
  [Section 29.10, “Performance Schema Statement Digests and Sampling”](performance-schema-statement-digests.md "29.10 Performance Schema Statement Digests and Sampling").

  The
  [`performance_schema_max_digest_length`](performance-schema-system-variables.md#sysvar_performance_schema_max_digest_length)
  system variable determines the maximum number of bytes
  available per session for digest value storage. However,
  the display length of statement digests may be longer than
  the available buffer size due to encoding of statement
  elements such as keywords and literal values in digest
  buffer. Consequently, values selected from the
  `DIGEST_TEXT` column of statement event
  tables may appear to exceed the
  [`performance_schema_max_digest_length`](performance-schema-system-variables.md#sysvar_performance_schema_max_digest_length)
  value.
- `CURRENT_SCHEMA`

  The default database for the statement,
  `NULL` if there is none.
- `OBJECT_SCHEMA`,
  `OBJECT_NAME`,
  `OBJECT_TYPE`

  For nested statements (stored programs), these columns
  contain information about the parent statement. Otherwise
  they are `NULL`.
- `OBJECT_INSTANCE_BEGIN`

  This column identifies the statement. The value is the
  address of an object in memory.
- `MYSQL_ERRNO`

  The statement error number, from the statement diagnostics
  area.
- `RETURNED_SQLSTATE`

  The statement SQLSTATE value, from the statement
  diagnostics area.
- `MESSAGE_TEXT`

  The statement error message, from the statement
  diagnostics area.
- `ERRORS`

  Whether an error occurred for the statement. The value is
  0 if the SQLSTATE value begins with `00`
  (completion) or `01` (warning). The value
  is 1 is the SQLSTATE value is anything else.
- `WARNINGS`

  The number of warnings, from the statement diagnostics
  area.
- `ROWS_AFFECTED`

  The number of rows affected by the statement. For a
  description of the meaning of “affected,” see
  [mysql\_affected\_rows()](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/c-api/8.0/en/mysql-affected-rows.html).
- `ROWS_SENT`

  The number of rows returned by the statement.
- `ROWS_EXAMINED`

  The number of rows examined by the server layer (not
  counting any processing internal to storage engines).
- `CREATED_TMP_DISK_TABLES`

  Like the
  [`Created_tmp_disk_tables`](server-status-variables.md#statvar_Created_tmp_disk_tables)
  status variable, but specific to the statement.
- `CREATED_TMP_TABLES`

  Like the
  [`Created_tmp_tables`](server-status-variables.md#statvar_Created_tmp_tables)
  status variable, but specific to the statement.
- `SELECT_FULL_JOIN`

  Like the
  [`Select_full_join`](server-status-variables.md#statvar_Select_full_join) status
  variable, but specific to the statement.
- `SELECT_FULL_RANGE_JOIN`

  status variable, but specific to the statement.
- `SELECT_RANGE_CHECK`

  Like the
  [`Select_range_check`](server-status-variables.md#statvar_Select_range_check)
  status variable, but specific to the statement.
- `SELECT_SCAN`

  Like the [`Select_scan`](server-status-variables.md#statvar_Select_scan)
  status variable, but specific to the statement.
- `SORT_MERGE_PASSES`

  Like the
  [`Sort_merge_passes`](server-status-variables.md#statvar_Sort_merge_passes) status
  variable, but specific to the statement.
- `SORT_RANGE`

  Like the [`Sort_range`](server-status-variables.md#statvar_Sort_range)
  status variable, but specific to the statement.
- `SORT_ROWS`

  Like the [`Sort_rows`](server-status-variables.md#statvar_Sort_rows)
  status variable, but specific to the statement.
- `SORT_SCAN`

  Like the [`Sort_scan`](server-status-variables.md#statvar_Sort_scan)
  status variable, but specific to the statement.
- `NO_INDEX_USED`

  1 if the statement performed a table scan without using an
  index, 0 otherwise.
- `NO_GOOD_INDEX_USED`

  1 if the server found no good index to use for the
  statement, 0 otherwise. For additional information, see
  the description of the `Extra` column
  from `EXPLAIN` output for the
  `Range checked for each record` value in
  [Section 10.8.2, “EXPLAIN Output Format”](explain-output.md "10.8.2 EXPLAIN Output Format").
- `NESTING_EVENT_ID`,
  `NESTING_EVENT_TYPE`,
  `NESTING_EVENT_LEVEL`

  These three columns are used with other columns to provide
  information as follows for top-level (unnested) statements
  and nested statements (executed within a stored program).

  For top level statements:

  ```none
  OBJECT_TYPE = NULL
  OBJECT_SCHEMA = NULL
  OBJECT_NAME = NULL
  NESTING_EVENT_ID = the parent transaction EVENT_ID
  NESTING_EVENT_TYPE = 'TRANSACTION'
  NESTING_LEVEL = 0
  ```

  For nested statements:

  ```none
  OBJECT_TYPE = the parent statement object type
  OBJECT_SCHEMA = the parent statement object schema
  OBJECT_NAME = the parent statement object name
  NESTING_EVENT_ID = the parent statement EVENT_ID
  NESTING_EVENT_TYPE = 'STATEMENT'
  NESTING_LEVEL = the parent statement NESTING_LEVEL plus one
  ```
- `STATEMENT_ID`

  The query ID maintained by the server at the SQL level.
  The value is unique for the server instance because these
  IDs are generated using a global counter that is
  incremented atomically. This column was added in MySQL
  8.0.14.
- `CPU_TIME`

  The time spent on CPU for the current thread, expressed in
  picoseconds. This column was added in MySQL 8.0.28.
- `MAX_CONTROLLED_MEMORY`

  Reports the maximum amount of controlled memory used by a
  statement during execution.

  This column was added in MySQL 8.0.31.
- `MAX_TOTAL_MEMORY`

  Reports the maximum amount of memory used by a statement
  during execution.

  This column was added in MySQL 8.0.31.
- `EXECUTION_ENGINE`

  The query execution engine. The value is either
  `PRIMARY` or
  `SECONDARY`. For use with MySQL HeatWave Service and
  MySQL HeatWave, where the `PRIMARY` engine is
  `InnoDB` and the
  `SECONDARY` engine is MySQL HeatWave
  (`RAPID`). For MySQL Community Edition Server, MySQL Enterprise Edition Server
  (on-premise), and MySQL HeatWave Service without MySQL HeatWave, the value is
  always `PRIMARY`. This column was added
  in MySQL 8.0.29.

The [`events_statements_current`](performance-schema-events-statements-current-table.md "29.12.6.1 The events_statements_current Table")
table has these indexes:

- Primary key on (`THREAD_ID`,
  `EVENT_ID`)

[`TRUNCATE TABLE`](truncate-table.md "15.1.37 TRUNCATE TABLE Statement") is permitted for
the [`events_statements_current`](performance-schema-events-statements-current-table.md "29.12.6.1 The events_statements_current Table")
table. It removes the rows.
