### 12.10.1 Unicode Character Sets

This section describes the collations available for Unicode
character sets and their differentiating properties. For general
information about Unicode, see
[Section 12.9, “Unicode Support”](charset-unicode.md "12.9 Unicode Support").

MySQL supports multiple Unicode character sets:

- `utf8mb4`: A UTF-8 encoding of the Unicode
  character set using one to four bytes per character.
- `utf8mb3`: A UTF-8 encoding of the Unicode
  character set using one to three bytes per character. This
  character set is deprecated in MySQL 8.0, and you should use
  `utf8mb4` instead.
- `utf8`: An alias for
  `utf8mb3`. In MySQL 8.0, this alias is
  deprecated; use `utf8mb4` instead.
  `utf8` is expected in a future release to
  become an alias for `utf8mb4`.
- `ucs2`: The UCS-2 encoding of the Unicode
  character set using two bytes per character. Deprecated in
  MySQL 8.0.28; you should expect support for this character
  set to be removed in a future release.
- `utf16`: The UTF-16 encoding for the
  Unicode character set using two or four bytes per character.
  Like `ucs2` but with an extension for
  supplementary characters.
- `utf16le`: The UTF-16LE encoding for the
  Unicode character set. Like `utf16` but
  little-endian rather than big-endian.
- `utf32`: The UTF-32 encoding for the
  Unicode character set using four bytes per character.

Note

The `utf8mb3` character set is deprecated and
you should expect it to be removed in a future MySQL release.
Please use `utf8mb4` instead.
`utf8` is currently an alias for
`utf8mb3`, but it is now deprecated as such,
and `utf8` is expected subsequently to become
a reference to `utf8mb4`. Beginning with
MySQL 8.0.28, `utf8mb3` is also displayed in
place of `utf8` in columns of Information
Schema tables, and in the output of SQL
`SHOW` statements.

To avoid ambiguity about the meaning of
`utf8`, consider specifying
`utf8mb4` explicitly for character set
references.

`utf8mb4`, `utf16`,
`utf16le`, and `utf32` support
Basic Multilingual Plane (BMP) characters and supplementary
characters that lie outside the BMP. `utf8mb3`
and `ucs2` support only BMP characters.

Most Unicode character sets have a general collation (indicated
by `_general` in the name or by the absence of
a language specifier), a binary collation (indicated by
`_bin` in the name), and several
language-specific collations (indicated by language specifiers).
For example, for `utf8mb4`,
`utf8mb4_general_ci` and
`utf8mb4_bin` are its general and binary
collations, and `utf8mb4_danish_ci` is one of
its language-specific collations.

Most character sets have a single binary collation.
`utf8mb4` is an exception that has two:
`utf8mb4_bin` and (as of MySQL 8.0.17)
`utf8mb4_0900_bin`. These two binary collations
have the same sort order but are distinguished by their pad
attribute and collating weight characteristics. See
[Collation Pad Attributes](charset-unicode-sets.md#charset-unicode-sets-pad-attributes "Collation Pad Attributes"), and
[Character Collating Weights](charset-unicode-sets.md#charset-unicode-sets-collating-weights "Character Collating Weights").

Collation support for `utf16le` is limited. The
only collations available are
`utf16le_general_ci` and
`utf16le_bin`. These are similar to
`utf16_general_ci` and
`utf16_bin`.

#### Unicode Collation Algorithm (UCA) Versions

MySQL implements the
`xxx_unicode_ci`
collations according to the Unicode Collation Algorithm (UCA)
described at
<http://www.unicode.org/reports/tr10/>. The
collation uses the version-4.0.0 UCA weight keys:
<http://www.unicode.org/Public/UCA/4.0.0/allkeys-4.0.0.txt>.
The
`xxx_unicode_ci`
collations have only partial support for the Unicode Collation
Algorithm. Some characters are not supported, and combining
marks are not fully supported. This affects languages such as
Vietnamese, Yoruba, and Navajo. A combined character is
considered different from the same character written with a
single unicode character in string comparisons, and the two
characters are considered to have a different length (for
example, as returned by the
[`CHAR_LENGTH()`](string-functions.md#function_char-length) function or in
result set metadata).

Unicode collations based on UCA versions higher than 4.0.0
include the version in the collation name. Examples:

- `utf8mb4_unicode_520_ci` is based on UCA
  5.2.0 weight keys
  (<http://www.unicode.org/Public/UCA/5.2.0/allkeys.txt>),
- `utf8mb4_0900_ai_ci` is based on UCA
  9.0.0 weight keys
  (<http://www.unicode.org/Public/UCA/9.0.0/allkeys.txt>).

The [`LOWER()`](string-functions.md#function_lower) and
[`UPPER()`](string-functions.md#function_upper) functions perform case
folding according to the collation of their argument. A
character that has uppercase and lowercase versions only in a
Unicode version higher than 4.0.0 is converted by these
functions only if the argument collation uses a high enough
UCA version.

#### Collation Pad Attributes

Collations based on UCA 9.0.0 and higher are faster than
collations based on UCA versions prior to 9.0.0. They also
have a pad attribute of `NO PAD`, in contrast
to `PAD SPACE` as used in collations based on
UCA versions prior to 9.0.0. For comparison of nonbinary
strings, `NO PAD` collations treat spaces at
the end of strings like any other character (see
[Trailing Space Handling in Comparisons](charset-binary-collations.md#charset-binary-collations-trailing-space-comparisons "Trailing Space Handling in Comparisons")).

To determine the pad attribute for a collation, use the
`INFORMATION_SCHEMA`
[`COLLATIONS`](information-schema-collations-table.md "28.3.6 The INFORMATION_SCHEMA COLLATIONS Table") table, which has a
`PAD_ATTRIBUTE` column. For example:

```sql
mysql> SELECT COLLATION_NAME, PAD_ATTRIBUTE
       FROM INFORMATION_SCHEMA.COLLATIONS
       WHERE CHARACTER_SET_NAME = 'utf8mb4';
+----------------------------+---------------+
| COLLATION_NAME             | PAD_ATTRIBUTE |
+----------------------------+---------------+
| utf8mb4_general_ci         | PAD SPACE     |
| utf8mb4_bin                | PAD SPACE     |
| utf8mb4_unicode_ci         | PAD SPACE     |
| utf8mb4_icelandic_ci       | PAD SPACE     |
...
| utf8mb4_0900_ai_ci         | NO PAD        |
| utf8mb4_de_pb_0900_ai_ci   | NO PAD        |
| utf8mb4_is_0900_ai_ci      | NO PAD        |
...
| utf8mb4_ja_0900_as_cs      | NO PAD        |
| utf8mb4_ja_0900_as_cs_ks   | NO PAD        |
| utf8mb4_0900_as_ci         | NO PAD        |
| utf8mb4_ru_0900_ai_ci      | NO PAD        |
| utf8mb4_ru_0900_as_cs      | NO PAD        |
| utf8mb4_zh_0900_as_cs      | NO PAD        |
| utf8mb4_0900_bin           | NO PAD        |
+----------------------------+---------------+
```

Comparison of nonbinary string values
(`CHAR`, `VARCHAR`, and
`TEXT`) that have a `NO PAD`
collation differ from other collations with respect to
trailing spaces. For example, `'a'` and
`'a '` compare as different strings, not
the same string. This can be seen using the binary collations
for `utf8mb4`. The pad attribute for
`utf8mb4_bin` is `PAD
SPACE`, whereas for
`utf8mb4_0900_bin` it is `NO
PAD`. Consequently, operations involving
`utf8mb4_0900_bin` do not add trailing
spaces, and comparisons involving strings with trailing spaces
may differ for the two collations:

```sql
mysql> CREATE TABLE t1 (c CHAR(10) COLLATE utf8mb4_bin);
Query OK, 0 rows affected (0.03 sec)

mysql> INSERT INTO t1 VALUES('a');
Query OK, 1 row affected (0.01 sec)

mysql> SELECT * FROM t1 WHERE c = 'a ';
+------+
| c    |
+------+
| a    |
+------+
1 row in set (0.00 sec)

mysql> ALTER TABLE t1 MODIFY c CHAR(10) COLLATE utf8mb4_0900_bin;
Query OK, 0 rows affected (0.02 sec)
Records: 0  Duplicates: 0  Warnings: 0

mysql> SELECT * FROM t1 WHERE c = 'a ';
Empty set (0.00 sec)
```

#### Language-Specific Collations

MySQL implements language-specific Unicode collations if the
ordering based only on the Unicode Collation Algorithm (UCA)
does not work well for a language. Language-specific
collations are UCA-based, with additional language tailoring
rules. Examples of such rules appear later in this section.
For questions about particular language orderings,
<http://unicode.org> provides Common Locale Data
Repository (CLDR) collation charts at
<http://www.unicode.org/cldr/charts/30/collation/index.html>.

For example, the nonlanguage-specific
`utf8mb4_0900_ai_ci` and language-specific
`utf8mb4_LOCALE_0900_ai_ci`
Unicode collations each have these characteristics:

- The collation is based on UCA 9.0.0 and CLDR v30, is
  accent-insensitive and case-insensitive. These
  characteristics are indicated by `_0900`,
  `_ai`, and `_ci` in the
  collation name. Exception:
  `utf8mb4_la_0900_ai_ci` is not based on
  CLDR because Classical Latin is not defined in CLDR.
- The collation works for all characters in the range [U+0,
  U+10FFFF].
- If the collation is not language specific, it sorts all
  characters, including supplementary characters, in default
  order (described following). If the collation is language
  specific, it sorts characters of the language correctly
  according to language-specific rules, and characters not
  in the language in default order.
- By default, the collation sorts characters having a code
  point listed in the DUCET table (Default Unicode Collation
  Element Table) according to the weight value assigned in
  the table. The collation sorts characters not having a
  code point listed in the DUCET table using their implicit
  weight value, which is constructed according to the UCA.
- For non-language-specific collations, characters in
  contraction sequences are treated as separate characters.
  For language-specific collations, contractions might
  change character sorting order.

A collation name that includes a locale code or language name
shown in the following table is a language-specific collation.
Unicode character sets may include collations for one or more
of these languages.

**Table 12.3 Unicode Collation Language Specifiers**

| Language | Language Specifier |
| --- | --- |
| Bosnian | `bs` |
| Bulgarian | `bg` |
| Chinese | `zh` |
| Classical Latin | `la` or `roman` |
| Croatian | `hr` or `croatian` |
| Czech | `cs` or `czech` |
| Danish | `da` or `danish` |
| Esperanto | `eo` or `esperanto` |
| Estonian | `et` or `estonian` |
| Galician | `gl` |
| German phone book order | `de_pb` or `german2` |
| Hungarian | `hu` or `hungarian` |
| Icelandic | `is` or `icelandic` |
| Japanese | `ja` |
| Latvian | `lv` or `latvian` |
| Lithuanian | `lt` or `lithuanian` |
| Mongolian | `mn` |
| Norwegian / Bokmål | `nb` |
| Norwegian / Nynorsk | `nn` |
| Persian | `persian` |
| Polish | `pl` or `polish` |
| Romanian | `ro` or `romanian` |
| Russian | `ru` |
| Serbian | `sr` |
| Sinhala | `sinhala` |
| Slovak | `sk` or `slovak` |
| Slovenian | `sl` or `slovenian` |
| Modern Spanish | `es` or `spanish` |
| Traditional Spanish | `es_trad` or `spanish2` |
| Swedish | `sv` or `swedish` |
| Turkish | `tr` or `turkish` |
| Vietnamese | `vi` or `vietnamese` |

MySQL 8.0.30 and later provides the Bulgarian collations
`utf8mb4_bg_0900_ai_ci` and
`utf8mb4_bg_0900_as_cs`.

Croatian collations are tailored for these Croatian letters:
`Č`, `Ć`,
`Dž`, `Đ`,
`Lj`, `Nj`,
`Š`, `Ž`.

MySQL 8.0.30 and later provides the
`utf8mb4_sr_latn_0900_ai_ci` and
`utf8mb4_sr_latn_0900_as_cs` collations for
Serbian and the `utf8mb4_bs_0900_ai_ci` and
`utf8mb4_bs_0900_as_cs` collations for
Bosnian, when these languages are written with the Latin
alphabet.

Beginning with MySQL 8.0.30, MySQL provides collations for
both major varieties of Norwegian: for Bokmål, you can use
`utf8mb4_nb_0900_ai_ci` and
`utf8mb4_nb_0900_as_cs`; for Nynorsk, MySQL
now provides `utf8mb4_nn_0900_ai_ci` and
`utf8mb4_nn_0900_as_cs`.

For Japanese, the `utf8mb4` character set
includes `utf8mb4_ja_0900_as_cs` and
`utf8mb4_ja_0900_as_cs_ks` collations. Both
collations are accent-sensitive and case-sensitive.
`utf8mb4_ja_0900_as_cs_ks` is also
kana-sensitive and distinguishes Katakana characters from
Hiragana characters, whereas
`utf8mb4_ja_0900_as_cs` treats Katakana and
Hiragana characters as equal for sorting. Applications that
require a Japanese collation but not kana sensitivity may use
`utf8mb4_ja_0900_as_cs` for better sort
performance. `utf8mb4_ja_0900_as_cs` uses
three weight levels for sorting;
`utf8mb4_ja_0900_as_cs_ks` uses four.

For Classical Latin collations that are accent-insensitive,
`I` and `J` compare as
equal, and `U` and `V`
compare as equal. `I` and
`J`, and `U` and
`V` compare as equal on the base letter
level. In other words, `J` is regarded as an
accented `I`, and `U` is
regarded as an accented `V`.

MySQL 8.0.30 and later provides collations for the Mongolian
language when written with Cyrillic characters,
`utf8mb4_mn_cyrl_0900_ai_ci` and
`utf8mb4_mn_cyrl_0900_as_cs`.

Spanish collations are available for modern and traditional
Spanish. For both, `ñ` (n-tilde) is a
separate letter between `n` and
`o`. In addition, for traditional Spanish,
`ch` is a separate letter between
`c` and `d`, and
`ll` is a separate letter between
`l` and `m`.

Traditional Spanish collations may also be used for Asturian
and Galician. Beginning with MySQL 8.0.30, MySQL also provides
`utf8mb4_gl_0900_ai_ci` and
`utf8mb4_gl_0900_as_cs` collations for
Galician. (These are the same collations as
`utf8mb4_es_0900_ai_ci` and
`utf8mb4_es_0900_as_cs`, respectively.)

Swedish collations include Swedish rules. For example, in
Swedish, the following relationship holds, which is not
something expected by a German or French speaker:

```none
Ü = Y < Ö
```

#### \_general\_ci Versus \_unicode\_ci Collations

For any Unicode character set, operations performed using the
`xxx_general_ci`
collation are faster than those for the
`xxx_unicode_ci`
collation. For example, comparisons for the
`utf8mb4_general_ci` collation are faster,
but slightly less correct, than comparisons for
`utf8mb4_unicode_ci`. The reason is that
`utf8mb4_unicode_ci` supports mappings such
as expansions; that is, when one character compares as equal
to combinations of other characters. For example,
`ß` is equal to `ss` in
German and some other languages.
`utf8mb4_unicode_ci` also supports
contractions and ignorable characters.
`utf8mb4_general_ci` is a legacy collation
that does not support expansions, contractions, or ignorable
characters. It can make only one-to-one comparisons between
characters.

To further illustrate, the following equalities hold in both
`utf8mb4_general_ci` and
`utf8mb4_unicode_ci` (for the effect of this
in comparisons or searches, see
[Section 12.8.6, “Examples of the Effect of Collation”](charset-collation-effect.md "12.8.6 Examples of the Effect of Collation")):

```none
Ä = A
Ö = O
Ü = U
```

A difference between the collations is that this is true for
`utf8mb4_general_ci`:

```none
ß = s
```

Whereas this is true for
`utf8mb4_unicode_ci`, which supports the
German DIN-1 ordering (also known as dictionary order):

```none
ß = ss
```

MySQL implements language-specific Unicode collations if the
ordering with `utf8mb4_unicode_ci` does not
work well for a language. For example,
`utf8mb4_unicode_ci` works fine for German
dictionary order and French, so there is no need to create
special `utf8mb4` collations.

`utf8mb4_general_ci` also is satisfactory for
both German and French, except that `ß` is
equal to `s`, and not to
`ss`. If this is acceptable for your
application, you should use
`utf8mb4_general_ci` because it is faster. If
this is not acceptable (for example, if you require German
dictionary order), use `utf8mb4_unicode_ci`
because it is more accurate.

If you require German DIN-2 (phone book) ordering, use the
`utf8mb4_german2_ci` collation, which
compares the following sets of characters equal:

```none
Ä = Æ = AE
Ö = Œ = OE
Ü = UE
ß = ss
```

`utf8mb4_german2_ci` is similar to
`latin1_german2_ci`, but the latter does not
compare `Æ` equal to `AE`
or `Œ` equal to `OE`. There
is no `utf8mb4_german_ci` corresponding to
`latin1_german_ci` for German dictionary
order because `utf8mb4_general_ci` suffices.

#### Character Collating Weights

A character's collating weight is determined as follows:

- For all Unicode collations except the
  `_bin` (binary) collations, MySQL
  performs a table lookup to find a character's collating
  weight.
- For `_bin` collations except
  `utf8mb4_0900_bin`, the weight is based
  on the code point, possibly with leading zero bytes added.
- For `utf8mb4_0900_bin`, the weight is the
  `utf8mb4` encoding bytes. The sort order
  is the same as for `utf8mb4_bin`, but
  much faster.

Collating weights can be displayed using the
[`WEIGHT_STRING()`](string-functions.md#function_weight-string) function. (See
[Section 14.8, “String Functions and Operators”](string-functions.md "14.8 String Functions and Operators").) If a collation uses a
weight lookup table, but a character is not in the table (for
example, because it is a “new” character),
collating weight determination becomes more complex:

- For BMP characters in general collations
  (`xxx_general_ci`),
  the weight is the code point.
- For BMP characters in UCA collations (for example,
  `xxx_unicode_ci`
  and language-specific collations), the following algorithm
  applies:

  ```clike
  if (code >= 0x3400 && code <= 0x4DB5)
    base= 0xFB80; /* CJK Ideograph Extension */
  else if (code >= 0x4E00 && code <= 0x9FA5)
    base= 0xFB40; /* CJK Ideograph */
  else
    base= 0xFBC0; /* All other characters */
  aaaa= base +  (code >> 15);
  bbbb= (code & 0x7FFF) | 0x8000;
  ```

  The result is a sequence of two collating elements,
  `aaaa` followed by
  `bbbb`. For example:

  ```sql
  mysql> SELECT HEX(WEIGHT_STRING(_ucs2 0x04CF COLLATE ucs2_unicode_ci));
  +----------------------------------------------------------+
  | HEX(WEIGHT_STRING(_ucs2 0x04CF COLLATE ucs2_unicode_ci)) |
  +----------------------------------------------------------+
  | FBC084CF                                                 |
  +----------------------------------------------------------+
  ```

  Thus, `U+04cf CYRILLIC SMALL LETTER
  PALOCHKA` (`ӏ`) is, with all
  UCA 4.0.0 collations, greater than `U+04c0
  CYRILLIC LETTER PALOCHKA`
  (`Ӏ`). With UCA 5.2.0 collations, all
  palochkas sort together.
- For supplementary characters in general collations, the
  weight is the weight for `0xfffd REPLACEMENT
  CHARACTER`. For supplementary characters in UCA
  4.0.0 collations, their collating weight is
  `0xfffd`. That is, to MySQL, all
  supplementary characters are equal to each other, and
  greater than almost all BMP characters.

  An example with Deseret characters and
  `COUNT(DISTINCT)`:

  ```sql
  CREATE TABLE t (s1 VARCHAR(5) CHARACTER SET utf32 COLLATE utf32_unicode_ci);
  INSERT INTO t VALUES (0xfffd);   /* REPLACEMENT CHARACTER */
  INSERT INTO t VALUES (0x010412); /* DESERET CAPITAL LETTER BEE */
  INSERT INTO t VALUES (0x010413); /* DESERET CAPITAL LETTER TEE */
  SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT s1) FROM t;
  ```

  The result is 2 because in the MySQL
  `xxx_unicode_ci`
  collations, the replacement character has a weight of
  `0x0dc6`, whereas Deseret Bee and Deseret
  Tee both have a weight of `0xfffd`. (Were
  the `utf32_general_ci` collation used
  instead, the result is 1 because all three characters have
  a weight of `0xfffd` in that collation.)

  An example with cuneiform characters and
  [`WEIGHT_STRING()`](string-functions.md#function_weight-string):

  ```sql
  /*
  The four characters in the INSERT string are
  00000041  # LATIN CAPITAL LETTER A
  0001218F  # CUNEIFORM SIGN KAB
  000121A7  # CUNEIFORM SIGN KISH
  00000042  # LATIN CAPITAL LETTER B
  */
  CREATE TABLE t (s1 CHAR(4) CHARACTER SET utf32 COLLATE utf32_unicode_ci);
  INSERT INTO t VALUES (0x000000410001218f000121a700000042);
  SELECT HEX(WEIGHT_STRING(s1)) FROM t;
  ```

  The result is:

  ```none
  0E33 FFFD FFFD 0E4A
  ```

  `0E33` and `0E4A` are
  primary weights as in
  [UCA
  4.0.0](ftp://www.unicode.org/Public/UCA/4.0.0/allkeys-4.0.0.txt). `FFFD` is the weight for
  KAB and also for KISH.

  The rule that all supplementary characters are equal to
  each other is nonoptimal but is not expected to cause
  trouble. These characters are very rare, so it is very
  rare that a multi-character string consists entirely of
  supplementary characters. In Japan, since the
  supplementary characters are obscure Kanji ideographs, the
  typical user does not care what order they are in, anyway.
  If you really want rows sorted by the MySQL rule and
  secondarily by code point value, it is easy:

  ```sql
  ORDER BY s1 COLLATE utf32_unicode_ci, s1 COLLATE utf32_bin
  ```
- For supplementary characters based on UCA versions higher
  than 4.0.0 (for example,
  `xxx_unicode_520_ci`),
  supplementary characters do not necessarily all have the
  same collating weight. Some have explicit weights from the
  UCA `allkeys.txt` file. Others have
  weights calculated from this algorithm:

  ```clike
  aaaa= base +  (code >> 15);
  bbbb= (code & 0x7FFF) | 0x8000;
  ```

There is a difference between “ordering by the
character's code value” and “ordering by the
character's binary representation,” a difference that
appears only with `utf16_bin`, because of
surrogates.

Suppose that `utf16_bin` (the binary
collation for `utf16`) was a binary
comparison “byte by byte” rather than
“character by character.” If that were so, the
order of characters in `utf16_bin` would
differ from the order in `utf8mb4_bin`. For
example, the following chart shows two rare characters. The
first character is in the range
`E000`-`FFFF`, so it is
greater than a surrogate but less than a supplementary. The
second character is a supplementary.

```none
Code point  Character                    utf8mb4      utf16
----------  ---------                    -------      -----
0FF9D       HALFWIDTH KATAKANA LETTER N  EF BE 9D     FF 9D
10384       UGARITIC LETTER DELTA        F0 90 8E 84  D8 00 DF 84
```

The two characters in the chart are in order by code point
value because `0xff9d` <
`0x10384`. And they are in order by
`utf8mb4` value because
`0xef` < `0xf0`. But they
are not in order by `utf16` value, if we use
byte-by-byte comparison, because `0xff` >
`0xd8`.

So MySQL's `utf16_bin` collation is not
“byte by byte.” It is “by code
point.” When MySQL sees a supplementary-character
encoding in `utf16`, it converts to the
character's code-point value, and then compares. Therefore,
`utf8mb4_bin` and
`utf16_bin` are the same ordering. This is
consistent with the SQL:2008 standard requirement for a
UCS\_BASIC collation: “UCS\_BASIC is a collation in which
the ordering is determined entirely by the Unicode scalar
values of the characters in the strings being sorted. It is
applicable to the UCS character repertoire. Since every
character repertoire is a subset of the UCS repertoire, the
UCS\_BASIC collation is potentially applicable to every
character set. NOTE 11: The Unicode scalar value of a
character is its code point treated as an unsigned
integer.”

If the character set is `ucs2`, comparison is
byte-by-byte, but `ucs2` strings should not
contain surrogates, anyway.

#### Miscellaneous Information

The
`xxx_general_mysql500_ci`
collations preserve the pre-5.1.24 ordering of the original
`xxx_general_ci`
collations and permit upgrades for tables created before MySQL
5.1.24 (Bug #27877).
