### 8.2.12 Privilege Restriction Using Partial Revokes

Prior to MySQL 8.0.16, it is not possible to grant privileges that
apply globally except for certain schemas. As of MySQL 8.0.16,
that is possible if the
[`partial_revokes`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_partial_revokes) system variable
is enabled. Specifically, for users who have privileges at the
global level, [`partial_revokes`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_partial_revokes)
enables privileges for specific schemas to be revoked while
leaving the privileges in place for other schemas. Privilege
restrictions thus imposed may be useful for administration of
accounts that have global privileges but should not be permitted
to access certain schemas. For example, it is possible to permit
an account to modify any table except those in the
`mysql` system schema.

For brevity, [`CREATE USER`](create-user.md "15.7.1.3 CREATE USER Statement")
statements shown here do not include passwords. For production
use, always assign account passwords.

#### Using Partial Revokes

The [`partial_revokes`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_partial_revokes) system
variable controls whether privilege restrictions can be placed
on accounts. By default,
[`partial_revokes`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_partial_revokes) is disabled and
attempts to partially revoke global privileges produce an error:

```sql
mysql> CREATE USER u1;
mysql> GRANT SELECT, INSERT ON *.* TO u1;
mysql> REVOKE INSERT ON world.* FROM u1;
ERROR 1141 (42000): There is no such grant defined for user 'u1' on host '%'
```

To permit the [`REVOKE`](revoke.md "15.7.1.8 REVOKE Statement") operation,
enable [`partial_revokes`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_partial_revokes):

```sql
SET PERSIST partial_revokes = ON;
```

[`SET
PERSIST`](set-variable.md "15.7.6.1 SET Syntax for Variable Assignment") sets a value for the running MySQL instance.
It also saves the value, causing it to carry over to subsequent
server restarts. To change the value for the running MySQL
instance without having it carry over to subsequent restarts,
use the `GLOBAL` keyword rather than
`PERSIST`. See [Section 15.7.6.1, “SET Syntax for Variable Assignment”](set-variable.md "15.7.6.1 SET Syntax for Variable Assignment").

With [`partial_revokes`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_partial_revokes) enabled,
the partial revoke succeeds:

```sql
mysql> REVOKE INSERT ON world.* FROM u1;
mysql> SHOW GRANTS FOR u1;
+------------------------------------------+
| Grants for u1@%                          |
+------------------------------------------+
| GRANT SELECT, INSERT ON *.* TO `u1`@`%`  |
| REVOKE INSERT ON `world`.* FROM `u1`@`%` |
+------------------------------------------+
```

[`SHOW GRANTS`](show-grants.md "15.7.7.21 SHOW GRANTS Statement") lists partial revokes
as [`REVOKE`](revoke.md "15.7.1.8 REVOKE Statement") statements in its
output. The result indicates that `u1` has
global [`SELECT`](privileges-provided.md#priv_select) and
[`INSERT`](privileges-provided.md#priv_insert) privileges, except that
[`INSERT`](privileges-provided.md#priv_insert) cannot be exercised for
tables in the `world` schema. That is, access
by `u1` to `world` tables is
read only.

The server records privilege restrictions implemented through
partial revokes in the `mysql.user` system
table. If an account has partial revokes, its
`User_attributes` column value has a
`Restrictions` attribute:

```sql
mysql> SELECT User, Host, User_attributes->>'$.Restrictions'
       FROM mysql.user WHERE User_attributes->>'$.Restrictions' <> '';
+------+------+------------------------------------------------------+
| User | Host | User_attributes->>'$.Restrictions'                   |
+------+------+------------------------------------------------------+
| u1   | %    | [{"Database": "world", "Privileges": ["INSERT"]}] |
+------+------+------------------------------------------------------+
```

Note

Although partial revokes can be imposed for any schema,
privilege restrictions on the `mysql` system
schema in particular are useful as part of a strategy for
preventing regular accounts from modifying system accounts.
See [Protecting System Accounts Against Manipulation by Regular Accounts](account-categories.md#protecting-system-accounts "Protecting System Accounts Against Manipulation by Regular Accounts").

Partial revoke operations are subject to these conditions:

- It is possible to use partial revokes to place restrictions
  on nonexistent schemas, but only if the revoked privilege is
  granted globally. If a privilege is not granted globally,
  revoking it for a nonexistent schema produces an error.
- Partial revokes apply at the schema level only. You cannot
  use partial revokes for privileges that apply only globally
  (such as [`FILE`](privileges-provided.md#priv_file) or
  [`BINLOG_ADMIN`](privileges-provided.md#priv_binlog-admin)), or for table,
  column, or routine privileges.
- In privilege assignments, enabling
  [`partial_revokes`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_partial_revokes) causes
  MySQL to interpret occurrences of unescaped
  `_` and `%` SQL wildcard
  characters in schema names as literal characters, just as if
  they had been escaped as `\_` and
  `\%`. Because this changes how MySQL
  interprets privileges, it may be advisable to avoid
  unescaped wildcard characters in privilege assignments for
  installations where
  [`partial_revokes`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_partial_revokes) may be
  enabled.

As mentioned previously, partial revokes of schema-level
privileges appear in [`SHOW GRANTS`](show-grants.md "15.7.7.21 SHOW GRANTS Statement")
output as [`REVOKE`](revoke.md "15.7.1.8 REVOKE Statement") statements. This
differs from how [`SHOW GRANTS`](show-grants.md "15.7.7.21 SHOW GRANTS Statement")
represents “plain” schema-level privileges:

- When granted, schema-level privileges are represented by
  their own [`GRANT`](grant.md "15.7.1.6 GRANT Statement") statements in
  the output:

  ```sql
  mysql> CREATE USER u1;
  mysql> GRANT UPDATE ON mysql.* TO u1;
  mysql> GRANT DELETE ON world.* TO u1;
  mysql> SHOW GRANTS FOR u1;
  +---------------------------------------+
  | Grants for u1@%                       |
  +---------------------------------------+
  | GRANT USAGE ON *.* TO `u1`@`%`        |
  | GRANT UPDATE ON `mysql`.* TO `u1`@`%` |
  | GRANT DELETE ON `world`.* TO `u1`@`%` |
  +---------------------------------------+
  ```
- When revoked, schema-level privileges simply disappear from
  the output. They do not appear as
  [`REVOKE`](revoke.md "15.7.1.8 REVOKE Statement") statements:

  ```sql
  mysql> REVOKE UPDATE ON mysql.* FROM u1;
  mysql> REVOKE DELETE ON world.* FROM u1;
  mysql> SHOW GRANTS FOR u1;
  +--------------------------------+
  | Grants for u1@%                |
  +--------------------------------+
  | GRANT USAGE ON *.* TO `u1`@`%` |
  +--------------------------------+
  ```

When a user grants a privilege, any restriction the grantor has
on the privilege is inherited by the grantee, unless the grantee
already has the privilege without the restriction. Consider the
following two users, one of whom has the global
[`SELECT`](privileges-provided.md#priv_select) privilege:

```sql
CREATE USER u1, u2;
GRANT SELECT ON *.* TO u2;
```

Suppose that an administrative user `admin` has
a global but partially revoked
[`SELECT`](privileges-provided.md#priv_select) privilege:

```sql
mysql> CREATE USER admin;
mysql> GRANT SELECT ON *.* TO admin WITH GRANT OPTION;
mysql> REVOKE SELECT ON mysql.* FROM admin;
mysql> SHOW GRANTS FOR admin;
+------------------------------------------------------+
| Grants for admin@%                                   |
+------------------------------------------------------+
| GRANT SELECT ON *.* TO `admin`@`%` WITH GRANT OPTION |
| REVOKE SELECT ON `mysql`.* FROM `admin`@`%`          |
+------------------------------------------------------+
```

If `admin` grants
[`SELECT`](privileges-provided.md#priv_select) globally to
`u1` and `u2`, the result
differs for each user:

- If `admin` grants
  [`SELECT`](privileges-provided.md#priv_select) globally to
  `u1`, who has no
  [`SELECT`](privileges-provided.md#priv_select) privilege to begin
  with, `u1` inherits the
  `admin` privilege restriction:

  ```sql
  mysql> GRANT SELECT ON *.* TO u1;
  mysql> SHOW GRANTS FOR u1;
  +------------------------------------------+
  | Grants for u1@%                          |
  +------------------------------------------+
  | GRANT SELECT ON *.* TO `u1`@`%`          |
  | REVOKE SELECT ON `mysql`.* FROM `u1`@`%` |
  +------------------------------------------+
  ```
- On the other hand, `u2` already holds a
  global [`SELECT`](privileges-provided.md#priv_select) privilege
  without restriction. [`GRANT`](grant.md "15.7.1.6 GRANT Statement")
  can only add to a grantee's existing privileges, not reduce
  them, so if `admin` grants
  [`SELECT`](privileges-provided.md#priv_select) globally to
  `u2`, `u2` does not
  inherit the `admin` restriction:

  ```sql
  mysql> GRANT SELECT ON *.* TO u2;
  mysql> SHOW GRANTS FOR u2;
  +---------------------------------+
  | Grants for u2@%                 |
  +---------------------------------+
  | GRANT SELECT ON *.* TO `u2`@`%` |
  +---------------------------------+
  ```

If a [`GRANT`](grant.md "15.7.1.6 GRANT Statement") statement includes an
`AS user` clause,
the privilege restrictions applied are those on the user/role
combination specified by the clause, rather than those on the
user who executes the statement. For information about the
`AS` clause, see [Section 15.7.1.6, “GRANT Statement”](grant.md "15.7.1.6 GRANT Statement").

Restrictions on new privileges granted to an account are added
to any existing restrictions for that account:

```sql
mysql> CREATE USER u1;
mysql> GRANT SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE ON *.* TO u1;
mysql> REVOKE INSERT ON mysql.* FROM u1;
mysql> SHOW GRANTS FOR u1;
+---------------------------------------------------------+
| Grants for u1@%                                         |
+---------------------------------------------------------+
| GRANT SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE ON *.* TO `u1`@`%` |
| REVOKE INSERT ON `mysql`.* FROM `u1`@`%`                |
+---------------------------------------------------------+
mysql> REVOKE DELETE, UPDATE ON db2.* FROM u1;
mysql> SHOW GRANTS FOR u1;
+---------------------------------------------------------+
| Grants for u1@%                                         |
+---------------------------------------------------------+
| GRANT SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE ON *.* TO `u1`@`%` |
| REVOKE UPDATE, DELETE ON `db2`.* FROM `u1`@`%`          |
| REVOKE INSERT ON `mysql`.* FROM `u1`@`%`                |
+---------------------------------------------------------+
```

Aggregation of privilege restrictions applies both when
privileges are partially revoked explicitly (as just shown) and
when restrictions are inherited implicitly from the user who
executes the statement or the user mentioned in an `AS
user` clause.

If an account has a privilege restriction on a schema:

- The account cannot grant to other accounts a privilege on
  the restricted schema or any object within it.
- Another account that does not have the restriction can grant
  privileges to the restricted account for the restricted
  schema or objects within it. Suppose that an unrestricted
  user executes these statements:

  ```sql
  CREATE USER u1;
  GRANT SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE ON *.* TO u1;
  REVOKE SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE ON mysql.* FROM u1;
  GRANT SELECT ON mysql.user TO u1;          -- grant table privilege
  GRANT SELECT(Host,User) ON mysql.db TO u1; -- grant column privileges
  ```

  The resulting account has these privileges, with the ability
  to perform limited operations within the restricted schema:

  ```sql
  mysql> SHOW GRANTS FOR u1;
  +-----------------------------------------------------------+
  | Grants for u1@%                                           |
  +-----------------------------------------------------------+
  | GRANT SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE ON *.* TO `u1`@`%`           |
  | REVOKE SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE ON `mysql`.* FROM `u1`@`%`  |
  | GRANT SELECT (`Host`, `User`) ON `mysql`.`db` TO `u1`@`%` |
  | GRANT SELECT ON `mysql`.`user` TO `u1`@`%`                |
  +-----------------------------------------------------------+
  ```

If an account has a restriction on a global privilege, the
restriction is removed by any of these actions:

- Granting the privilege globally to the account by an account
  that has no restriction on the privilege.
- Granting the privilege at the schema level.
- Revoking the privilege globally.

Consider a user `u1` who holds several
privileges globally, but with restrictions on
[`INSERT`](privileges-provided.md#priv_insert),
[`UPDATE`](privileges-provided.md#priv_update) and
[`DELETE`](privileges-provided.md#priv_delete):

```sql
mysql> CREATE USER u1;
mysql> GRANT SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE ON *.* TO u1;
mysql> REVOKE INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE ON mysql.* FROM u1;
mysql> SHOW GRANTS FOR u1;
+----------------------------------------------------------+
| Grants for u1@%                                          |
+----------------------------------------------------------+
| GRANT SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE ON *.* TO `u1`@`%`  |
| REVOKE INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE ON `mysql`.* FROM `u1`@`%` |
+----------------------------------------------------------+
```

Granting a privilege globally to `u1` from an
account with no restriction removes the privilege restriction.
For example, to remove the [`INSERT`](privileges-provided.md#priv_insert)
restriction:

```sql
mysql> GRANT INSERT ON *.* TO u1;
mysql> SHOW GRANTS FOR u1;
+---------------------------------------------------------+
| Grants for u1@%                                         |
+---------------------------------------------------------+
| GRANT SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE ON *.* TO `u1`@`%` |
| REVOKE UPDATE, DELETE ON `mysql`.* FROM `u1`@`%`        |
+---------------------------------------------------------+
```

Granting a privilege at the schema level to
`u1` removes the privilege restriction. For
example, to remove the [`UPDATE`](privileges-provided.md#priv_update)
restriction:

```sql
mysql> GRANT UPDATE ON mysql.* TO u1;
mysql> SHOW GRANTS FOR u1;
+---------------------------------------------------------+
| Grants for u1@%                                         |
+---------------------------------------------------------+
| GRANT SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE ON *.* TO `u1`@`%` |
| REVOKE DELETE ON `mysql`.* FROM `u1`@`%`                |
+---------------------------------------------------------+
```

Revoking a global privilege removes the privilege, including any
restrictions on it. For example, to remove the
[`DELETE`](privileges-provided.md#priv_delete) restriction (at the cost
of removing all [`DELETE`](privileges-provided.md#priv_delete) access):

```sql
mysql> REVOKE DELETE ON *.* FROM u1;
mysql> SHOW GRANTS FOR u1;
+-------------------------------------------------+
| Grants for u1@%                                 |
+-------------------------------------------------+
| GRANT SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE ON *.* TO `u1`@`%` |
+-------------------------------------------------+
```

If an account has a privilege at both the global and schema
levels, you must revoke it at the schema level twice to effect a
partial revoke. Suppose that `u1` has these
privileges, where [`INSERT`](privileges-provided.md#priv_insert) is held
both globally and on the `world` schema:

```sql
mysql> CREATE USER u1;
mysql> GRANT SELECT, INSERT ON *.* TO u1;
mysql> GRANT INSERT ON world.* TO u1;
mysql> SHOW GRANTS FOR u1;
+-----------------------------------------+
| Grants for u1@%                         |
+-----------------------------------------+
| GRANT SELECT, INSERT ON *.* TO `u1`@`%` |
| GRANT INSERT ON `world`.* TO `u1`@`%`   |
+-----------------------------------------+
```

Revoking [`INSERT`](privileges-provided.md#priv_insert) on
`world` revokes the schema-level privilege
([`SHOW GRANTS`](show-grants.md "15.7.7.21 SHOW GRANTS Statement") no longer displays
the schema-level [`GRANT`](grant.md "15.7.1.6 GRANT Statement")
statement):

```sql
mysql> REVOKE INSERT ON world.* FROM u1;
mysql> SHOW GRANTS FOR u1;
+-----------------------------------------+
| Grants for u1@%                         |
+-----------------------------------------+
| GRANT SELECT, INSERT ON *.* TO `u1`@`%` |
+-----------------------------------------+
```

Revoking [`INSERT`](privileges-provided.md#priv_insert) on
`world` again performs a partial revoke of the
global privilege ([`SHOW GRANTS`](show-grants.md "15.7.7.21 SHOW GRANTS Statement") now
includes a schema-level [`REVOKE`](revoke.md "15.7.1.8 REVOKE Statement")
statement):

```sql
mysql> REVOKE INSERT ON world.* FROM u1;
mysql> SHOW GRANTS FOR u1;
+------------------------------------------+
| Grants for u1@%                          |
+------------------------------------------+
| GRANT SELECT, INSERT ON *.* TO `u1`@`%`  |
| REVOKE INSERT ON `world`.* FROM `u1`@`%` |
+------------------------------------------+
```

#### Partial Revokes Versus Explicit Schema Grants

To provide access to accounts for some schemas but not others,
partial revokes provide an alternative to the approach of
explicitly granting schema-level access without granting global
privileges. The two approaches have different advantages and
disadvantages.

Granting schema-level privileges and not global privileges:

- Adding a new schema: The schema is inaccessible to existing
  accounts by default. For any account to which the schema
  should be accessible, the DBA must grant schema-level
  access.
- Adding a new account: The DBA must grant schema-level access
  for each schema to which the account should have access.

Granting global privileges in conjunction with partial revokes:

- Adding a new schema: The schema is accessible to existing
  accounts that have global privileges. For any such account
  to which the schema should be inaccessible, the DBA must add
  a partial revoke.
- Adding a new account: The DBA must grant the global
  privileges, plus a partial revoke on each restricted schema.

The approach that uses explicit schema-level grant is more
convenient for accounts for which access is limited to a few
schemas. The approach that uses partial revokes is more
convenient for accounts with broad access to all schemas except
a few.

#### Disabling Partial Revokes

Once enabled, [`partial_revokes`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_partial_revokes)
cannot be disabled if any account has privilege restrictions. If
any such account exists, disabling
[`partial_revokes`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_partial_revokes) fails:

- For attempts to disable
  [`partial_revokes`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_partial_revokes) at startup,
  the server logs an error message and enables
  [`partial_revokes`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_partial_revokes).
- For attempts to disable
  [`partial_revokes`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_partial_revokes) at runtime,
  an error occurs and the
  [`partial_revokes`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_partial_revokes) value
  remains unchanged.

To disable [`partial_revokes`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_partial_revokes) when
restrictions exist, the restrictions first must be removed:

1. Determine which accounts have partial revokes:

   ```sql
   SELECT User, Host, User_attributes->>'$.Restrictions'
   FROM mysql.user WHERE User_attributes->>'$.Restrictions' <> '';
   ```
2. For each such account, remove its privilege restrictions.
   Suppose that the previous step shows account
   `u1` to have these restrictions:

   ```sql
   [{"Database": "world", "Privileges": ["INSERT", "DELETE"]
   ```

   Restriction removal can be done various ways:

   - Grant the privileges globally, without restrictions:

     ```sql
     GRANT INSERT, DELETE ON *.* TO u1;
     ```
   - Grant the privileges at the schema level:

     ```sql
     GRANT INSERT, DELETE ON world.* TO u1;
     ```
   - Revoke the privileges globally (assuming that they are
     no longer needed):

     ```sql
     REVOKE INSERT, DELETE ON *.* FROM u1;
     ```
   - Remove the account itself (assuming that it is no longer
     needed):

     ```sql
     DROP USER u1;
     ```

After all privilege restrictions are removed, it is possible to
disable partial revokes:

```sql
SET PERSIST partial_revokes = OFF;
```

#### Partial Revokes and Replication

In replication scenarios, if
[`partial_revokes`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_partial_revokes) is enabled on
any host, it must be enabled on all hosts. Otherwise,
[`REVOKE`](revoke.md "15.7.1.8 REVOKE Statement") statements to partially
revoke a global privilege do not have the same effect for all
hosts on which replication occurs, potentially resulting in
replication inconsistencies or errors.

When [`partial_revokes`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_partial_revokes) is
enabled, an extended syntax is recorded in the binary log for
[`GRANT`](grant.md "15.7.1.6 GRANT Statement") statements, including the
current user that issued the statement and their currently
active roles. If a user or a role recorded in this way does not
exist on the replica, the replication applier thread stops at
the [`GRANT`](grant.md "15.7.1.6 GRANT Statement") statement
with an error. Ensure that all user accounts that issue or might
issue [`GRANT`](grant.md "15.7.1.6 GRANT Statement") statements on the
replication source server also exist on the replica, and have
the same set of roles as they have on the source.
