### 28.3.14 The INFORMATION\_SCHEMA EVENTS Table

The [`EVENTS`](information-schema-events-table.md "28.3.14 The INFORMATION_SCHEMA EVENTS Table") table provides information
about Event Manager events, which are discussed in
[Section 27.4, “Using the Event Scheduler”](event-scheduler.md "27.4 Using the Event Scheduler").

The [`EVENTS`](information-schema-events-table.md "28.3.14 The INFORMATION_SCHEMA EVENTS Table") table has these columns:

- `EVENT_CATALOG`

  The name of the catalog to which the event belongs. This value
  is always `def`.
- `EVENT_SCHEMA`

  The name of the schema (database) to which the event belongs.
- `EVENT_NAME`

  The name of the event.
- `DEFINER`

  The account named in the `DEFINER` clause
  (often the user who created the event), in
  `'user_name'@'host_name'`
  format.
- `TIME_ZONE`

  The event time zone, which is the time zone used for
  scheduling the event and that is in effect within the event as
  it executes. The default value is `SYSTEM`.
- `EVENT_BODY`

  The language used for the statements in the event's
  [`DO`](do.md "15.2.3 DO Statement") clause. The value is always
  `SQL`.
- `EVENT_DEFINITION`

  The text of the SQL statement making up the event's
  [`DO`](do.md "15.2.3 DO Statement") clause; in other words, the
  statement executed by this event.
- `EVENT_TYPE`

  The event repetition type, either `ONE TIME`
  (transient) or `RECURRING` (repeating).
- `EXECUTE_AT`

  For a one-time event, this is the
  [`DATETIME`](datetime.md "13.2.2 The DATE, DATETIME, and TIMESTAMP Types") value specified in the
  `AT` clause of the
  [`CREATE EVENT`](create-event.md "15.1.13 CREATE EVENT Statement") statement used to
  create the event, or of the last [`ALTER
  EVENT`](alter-event.md "15.1.3 ALTER EVENT Statement") statement that modified the event. The value
  shown in this column reflects the addition or subtraction of
  any `INTERVAL` value included in the event's
  `AT` clause. For example, if an event is
  created using `ON SCHEDULE AT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP +
  '1:6' DAY_HOUR`, and the event was created at
  2018-02-09 14:05:30, the value shown in this column would be
  `'2018-02-10 20:05:30'`. If the event's
  timing is determined by an `EVERY` clause
  instead of an `AT` clause (that is, if the
  event is recurring), the value of this column is
  `NULL`.
- `INTERVAL_VALUE`

  For a recurring event, the number of intervals to wait between
  event executions. For a transient event, the value is always
  `NULL`.
- `INTERVAL_FIELD`

  The time units used for the interval which a recurring event
  waits before repeating. For a transient event, the value is
  always `NULL`.
- `SQL_MODE`

  The SQL mode in effect when the event was created or altered,
  and under which the event executes. For the permitted values,
  see [Section 7.1.11, “Server SQL Modes”](sql-mode.md "7.1.11 Server SQL Modes").
- `STARTS`

  The start date and time for a recurring event. This is
  displayed as a [`DATETIME`](datetime.md "13.2.2 The DATE, DATETIME, and TIMESTAMP Types") value,
  and is `NULL` if no start date and time are
  defined for the event. For a transient event, this column is
  always `NULL`. For a recurring event whose
  definition includes a `STARTS` clause, this
  column contains the corresponding
  [`DATETIME`](datetime.md "13.2.2 The DATE, DATETIME, and TIMESTAMP Types") value. As with the
  `EXECUTE_AT` column, this value resolves any
  expressions used. If there is no `STARTS`
  clause affecting the timing of the event, this column is
  `NULL`
- `ENDS`

  For a recurring event whose definition includes a
  `ENDS` clause, this column contains the
  corresponding [`DATETIME`](datetime.md "13.2.2 The DATE, DATETIME, and TIMESTAMP Types") value.
  As with the `EXECUTE_AT` column, this value
  resolves any expressions used. If there is no
  `ENDS` clause affecting the timing of the
  event, this column is `NULL`.
- `STATUS`

  The event status. One of `ENABLED`,
  `DISABLED`, or
  `SLAVESIDE_DISABLED`.
  `SLAVESIDE_DISABLED` indicates that the
  creation of the event occurred on another MySQL server acting
  as a replication source and replicated to the current MySQL
  server which is acting as a replica, but the event is not
  presently being executed on the replica. For more information,
  see [Section 19.5.1.16, “Replication of Invoked Features”](replication-features-invoked.md "19.5.1.16 Replication of Invoked Features").
  information.
- `ON_COMPLETION`

  One of the two values `PRESERVE` or
  `NOT PRESERVE`.
- `CREATED`

  The date and time when the event was created. This is a
  [`TIMESTAMP`](datetime.md "13.2.2 The DATE, DATETIME, and TIMESTAMP Types") value.
- `LAST_ALTERED`

  The date and time when the event was last modified. This is a
  [`TIMESTAMP`](datetime.md "13.2.2 The DATE, DATETIME, and TIMESTAMP Types") value. If the event
  has not been modified since its creation, this value is the
  same as the `CREATED` value.
- `LAST_EXECUTED`

  The date and time when the event last executed. This is a
  [`DATETIME`](datetime.md "13.2.2 The DATE, DATETIME, and TIMESTAMP Types") value. If the event
  has never executed, this column is `NULL`.

  `LAST_EXECUTED` indicates when the event
  started. As a result, the `ENDS` column is
  never less than `LAST_EXECUTED`.
- `EVENT_COMMENT`

  The text of the comment, if the event has one. If not, this
  value is empty.
- `ORIGINATOR`

  The server ID of the MySQL server on which the event was
  created; used in replication. This value may be updated by
  [`ALTER EVENT`](alter-event.md "15.1.3 ALTER EVENT Statement") to the server ID of
  the server on which that statement occurs, if executed on a
  replication source. The default value is 0.
- `CHARACTER_SET_CLIENT`

  The session value of the
  [`character_set_client`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_character_set_client) system
  variable when the event was created.
- `COLLATION_CONNECTION`

  The session value of the
  [`collation_connection`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_collation_connection) system
  variable when the event was created.
- `DATABASE_COLLATION`

  The collation of the database with which the event is
  associated.

#### Notes

- [`EVENTS`](information-schema-events-table.md "28.3.14 The INFORMATION_SCHEMA EVENTS Table") is a nonstandard
  `INFORMATION_SCHEMA` table.
- Times in the [`EVENTS`](information-schema-events-table.md "28.3.14 The INFORMATION_SCHEMA EVENTS Table") table are
  displayed using the event time zone, the current session time
  zone, or UTC, as described in
  [Section 27.4.4, “Event Metadata”](events-metadata.md "27.4.4 Event Metadata").
- For more information about
  `SLAVESIDE_DISABLED` and the
  `ORIGINATOR` column, see
  [Section 19.5.1.16, “Replication of Invoked Features”](replication-features-invoked.md "19.5.1.16 Replication of Invoked Features").

#### Example

Suppose that the user `'jon'@'ghidora'` creates
an event named `e_daily`, and then modifies it a
few minutes later using an [`ALTER
EVENT`](alter-event.md "15.1.3 ALTER EVENT Statement") statement, as shown here:

```sql
DELIMITER |

CREATE EVENT e_daily
    ON SCHEDULE
      EVERY 1 DAY
    COMMENT 'Saves total number of sessions then clears the table each day'
    DO
      BEGIN
        INSERT INTO site_activity.totals (time, total)
          SELECT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP, COUNT(*)
            FROM site_activity.sessions;
        DELETE FROM site_activity.sessions;
      END |

DELIMITER ;

ALTER EVENT e_daily
    ENABLE;
```

(Note that comments can span multiple lines.)

This user can then run the following
[`SELECT`](select.md "15.2.13 SELECT Statement") statement, and obtain the
output shown:

```sql
mysql> SELECT * FROM INFORMATION_SCHEMA.EVENTS
       WHERE EVENT_NAME = 'e_daily'
       AND EVENT_SCHEMA = 'myschema'\G
*************************** 1. row ***************************

                      ERROR_FOR_DIVISION_BY_ZERO,
                      NO_ENGINE_SUBSTITUTION
              STARTS: 2018-08-08 11:06:34
                ENDS: NULL
              STATUS: ENABLED
       ON_COMPLETION: NOT PRESERVE

        LAST_ALTERED: 2018-08-08 11:06:34
       LAST_EXECUTED: 2018-08-08 16:06:34
       EVENT_COMMENT: Saves total number of sessions then clears the
                      table each day

```

Event information is also available from the
[`SHOW EVENTS`](show-events.md "15.7.7.18 SHOW EVENTS Statement") statement. See
[Section 15.7.7.18, “SHOW EVENTS Statement”](show-events.md "15.7.7.18 SHOW EVENTS Statement"). The following statements are
equivalent:

```sql
SELECT
    EVENT_SCHEMA, EVENT_NAME, DEFINER, TIME_ZONE, EVENT_TYPE, EXECUTE_AT,
    INTERVAL_VALUE, INTERVAL_FIELD, STARTS, ENDS, STATUS, ORIGINATOR,
    CHARACTER_SET_CLIENT, COLLATION_CONNECTION, DATABASE_COLLATION
  FROM INFORMATION_SCHEMA.EVENTS
  WHERE table_schema = 'db_name'
  [AND column_name LIKE 'wild']

SHOW EVENTS
  [FROM db_name]
  [LIKE 'wild']
```
