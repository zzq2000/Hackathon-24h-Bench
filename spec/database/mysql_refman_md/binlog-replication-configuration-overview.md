### 19.1.1 Binary Log File Position Based Replication Configuration Overview

This section describes replication between MySQL servers based on
the binary log file position method, where the MySQL instance
operating as the source (where the database changes take place)
writes updates and changes as “events” to the binary
log. The information in the binary log is stored in different
logging formats according to the database changes being recorded.
Replicas are configured to read the binary log from the source and
to execute the events in the binary log on the replica's local
database.

Each replica receives a copy of the entire contents of the binary
log. It is the responsibility of the replica to decide which
statements in the binary log should be executed. Unless you
specify otherwise, all events in the source's binary log are
executed on the replica. If required, you can configure the
replica to process only events that apply to particular databases
or tables.

Important

You cannot configure the source to log only certain events.

Each replica keeps a record of the binary log coordinates: the
file name and position within the file that it has read and
processed from the source. This means that multiple replicas can
be connected to the source and executing different parts of the
same binary log. Because the replicas control this process,
individual replicas can be connected and disconnected from the
server without affecting the source's operation. Also, because
each replica records the current position within the binary log,
it is possible for replicas to be disconnected, reconnect and then
resume processing.

The source and each replica must be configured with a unique ID
(using the [`server_id`](replication-options.md#sysvar_server_id) system
variable). In addition, each replica must be configured with
information about the source's host name, log file name, and
position within that file. These details can be controlled from
within a MySQL session using a [`CHANGE
REPLICATION SOURCE TO`](change-replication-source-to.md "15.4.2.3 CHANGE REPLICATION SOURCE TO Statement") statement (from MySQL 8.0.23) or
[`CHANGE MASTER TO`](change-master-to.md "15.4.2.1 CHANGE MASTER TO Statement") statement (before
MySQL 8.0.23) on the replica. The details are stored within the
replica's connection metadata repository (see
[Section 19.2.4, “Relay Log and Replication Metadata Repositories”](replica-logs.md "19.2.4 Relay Log and Replication Metadata Repositories")).
