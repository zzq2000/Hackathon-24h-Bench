### 17.20.4 InnoDB memcached Multiple get and Range Query Support

The `daemon_memcached` plugin supports multiple
get operations (fetching multiple key-value pairs in a single
**memcached** query) and range queries.

#### Multiple get Operations

The ability to fetch multiple key-value pairs in a single
**memcached** query improves read performance by
reducing communication traffic between the client and server. For
`InnoDB`, it means fewer transactions and
open-table operations.

The following example demonstrates multiple-get support. The
example uses the `test.city` table described in
[Creating a New Table and Column Mapping](innodb-memcached-setup.md#innodb-memcached-new-table-setup "Creating a New Table and Column Mapping").

```sql
mysql> USE test;
mysql> SELECT * FROM test.city;
+---------+-----------+-------------+---------+-------+------+--------+
| city_id | name      | state       | country | flags | cas  | expiry |
+---------+-----------+-------------+---------+-------+------+--------+
| B       | BANGALORE | BANGALORE   | IN      |     0 |    1 |      0 |
| C       | CHENNAI   | TAMIL NADU  | IN      |     0 |    0 |      0 |
| D       | DELHI     | DELHI       | IN      |     0 |    0 |      0 |
| H       | HYDERABAD | TELANGANA   | IN      |     0 |    0 |      0 |
| M       | MUMBAI    | MAHARASHTRA | IN      |     0 |    0 |      0 |
+---------+-----------+-------------+---------+-------+------+--------+
```

Run a `get` command to retrieve all values from
the `city` table. The results are returned in a
key-value pair sequence.

```terminal
telnet 127.0.0.1 11211
Trying 127.0.0.1...
Connected to 127.0.0.1.
Escape character is '^]'.
get B C D H M
VALUE B 0 22
BANGALORE|BANGALORE|IN
VALUE C 0 21
CHENNAI|TAMIL NADU|IN
VALUE D 0 14
DELHI|DELHI|IN
VALUE H 0 22
HYDERABAD|TELANGANA|IN
VALUE M 0 21
MUMBAI|MAHARASHTRA|IN
END
```

When retrieving multiple values in a single `get`
command, you can switch tables (using
`@@containers.name`
notation) to retrieve the value for the first key, but you cannot
switch tables for subsequent keys. For example, the table switch
in this example is valid:

```terminal
get @@aaa.AA BB
VALUE @@aaa.AA 8 12
HELLO, HELLO
VALUE BB 10 16
GOODBYE, GOODBYE
END
```

Attempting to switch tables again in the same
`get` command to retrieve a key value from a
different table is not supported.

There is no limit the number of keys that can be retrieved by a
multiple get operation, but there is a 128MB memory limit for
storing the result.

#### Range Queries

For range queries, the `daemon_memcached` plugin
supports the following comparison operators:
`<`, `>`,
`<=`, `>=`. An operator
must be preceded by an `@` symbol. When a range
query finds multiple matching key-value pairs, results are
returned in a key-value pair sequence.

The following examples demonstrate range query support. The
examples use the `test.city` table described in
[Creating a New Table and Column Mapping](innodb-memcached-setup.md#innodb-memcached-new-table-setup "Creating a New Table and Column Mapping").

```sql
mysql> SELECT * FROM test.city;
+---------+-----------+-------------+---------+-------+------+--------+
| city_id | name      | state       | country | flags | cas  | expiry |
+---------+-----------+-------------+---------+-------+------+--------+
| B       | BANGALORE | BANGALORE   | IN      |     0 |    1 |      0 |
| C       | CHENNAI   | TAMIL NADU  | IN      |     0 |    0 |      0 |
| D       | DELHI     | DELHI       | IN      |     0 |    0 |      0 |
| H       | HYDERABAD | TELANGANA   | IN      |     0 |    0 |      0 |
| M       | MUMBAI    | MAHARASHTRA | IN      |     0 |    0 |      0 |
+---------+-----------+-------------+---------+-------+------+--------+
```

Open a telnet session:

```terminal
telnet 127.0.0.1 11211
Trying 127.0.0.1...
Connected to 127.0.0.1.
Escape character is '^]'.
```

To get all values greater than `B`, enter
`get @>B`:

```terminal
get @>B
VALUE C 0 21
CHENNAI|TAMIL NADU|IN
VALUE D 0 14
DELHI|DELHI|IN
VALUE H 0 22
HYDERABAD|TELANGANA|IN
VALUE M 0 21
MUMBAI|MAHARASHTRA|IN
END
```

To get all values less than `M`, enter
`get @<M`:

```terminal
get @<M
VALUE B 0 22
BANGALORE|BANGALORE|IN
VALUE C 0 21
CHENNAI|TAMIL NADU|IN
VALUE D 0 14
DELHI|DELHI|IN
VALUE H 0 22
HYDERABAD|TELANGANA|IN
END
```

To get all values less than and including `M`,
enter `get @<=M`:

```terminal
get @<=M
VALUE B 0 22
BANGALORE|BANGALORE|IN
VALUE C 0 21
CHENNAI|TAMIL NADU|IN
VALUE D 0 14
DELHI|DELHI|IN
VALUE H 0 22
HYDERABAD|TELANGANA|IN
VALUE M 0 21
MUMBAI|MAHARASHTRA|IN
```

To get values greater than `B` but less than
`M`, enter `get @>B@<M`:

```terminal
get @>B@<M
VALUE C 0 21
CHENNAI|TAMIL NADU|IN
VALUE D 0 14
DELHI|DELHI|IN
VALUE H 0 22
HYDERABAD|TELANGANA|IN
END
```

A maximum of two comparison operators can be parsed, one being
either a 'less than' (`@<`) or 'less than or
equal to' (`@<=`) operator, and the other
being either a 'greater than' (`@>`) or
'greater than or equal to' (`@>=`) operator.
Any additional operators are assumed to be part of the key. For
example, if you issue a `get` command with three
operators, the third operator (`@>C`) is
treated as part of the key, and the `get` command
searches for values smaller than `M` and greater
than `B@>C`.

```terminal
get @<M@>B@>C
VALUE C 0 21
CHENNAI|TAMIL NADU|IN
VALUE D 0 14
DELHI|DELHI|IN
VALUE H 0 22
HYDERABAD|TELANGANA|IN
```
