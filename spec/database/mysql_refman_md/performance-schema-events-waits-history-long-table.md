#### 29.12.4.3 The events\_waits\_history\_long Table

The [`events_waits_history_long`](performance-schema-events-waits-history-long-table.md "29.12.4.3 The events_waits_history_long Table")
table contains *`N`* the most recent
wait events that have ended globally, across all threads. Wait
events are not added to the table until they have ended. When
the table becomes full, the oldest row is discarded when a new
row is added, regardless of which thread generated either row.

The Performance Schema autosizes the value of
*`N`* during server startup. To set the
table size explicitly, set the
[`performance_schema_events_waits_history_long_size`](performance-schema-system-variables.md#sysvar_performance_schema_events_waits_history_long_size)
system variable at server startup.

The [`events_waits_history_long`](performance-schema-events-waits-history-long-table.md "29.12.4.3 The events_waits_history_long Table")
table has the same columns as
[`events_waits_current`](performance-schema-events-waits-current-table.md "29.12.4.1 The events_waits_current Table"). See
[Section 29.12.4.1, “The events\_waits\_current Table”](performance-schema-events-waits-current-table.md "29.12.4.1 The events_waits_current Table").
Unlike [`events_waits_current`](performance-schema-events-waits-current-table.md "29.12.4.1 The events_waits_current Table"),
[`events_waits_history_long`](performance-schema-events-waits-history-long-table.md "29.12.4.3 The events_waits_history_long Table") has no
indexing.

[`TRUNCATE TABLE`](truncate-table.md "15.1.37 TRUNCATE TABLE Statement") is permitted for
the [`events_waits_history_long`](performance-schema-events-waits-history-long-table.md "29.12.4.3 The events_waits_history_long Table")
table. It removes the rows.

For more information about the relationship between the three
wait event tables, see
[Section 29.9, “Performance Schema Tables for Current and Historical Events”](performance-schema-event-tables.md "29.9 Performance Schema Tables for Current and Historical Events").

For information about configuring whether to collect wait
events, see [Section 29.12.4, “Performance Schema Wait Event Tables”](performance-schema-wait-tables.md "29.12.4 Performance Schema Wait Event Tables").
