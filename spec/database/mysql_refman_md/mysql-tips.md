##### Input-Line Editing

[**mysql**](mysql.md "6.5.1 mysql — The MySQL Command-Line Client") supports input-line editing, which
enables you to modify the current input line in place or recall
previous input lines. For example, the
**left-arrow** and **right-arrow**
keys move horizontally within the current input line, and the
**up-arrow** and **down-arrow** keys
move up and down through the set of previously entered lines.
**Backspace** deletes the character before the
cursor and typing new characters enters them at the cursor
position. To enter the line, press **Enter**.

On Windows, the editing key sequences are the same as supported
for command editing in console windows. On Unix, the key
sequences depend on the input library used to build
[**mysql**](mysql.md "6.5.1 mysql — The MySQL Command-Line Client") (for example, the
`libedit` or `readline`
library).

Documentation for the `libedit` and
`readline` libraries is available online. To
change the set of key sequences permitted by a given input
library, define key bindings in the library startup file. This
is a file in your home directory: `.editrc`
for `libedit` and `.inputrc`
for `readline`.

For example, in `libedit`,
**Control+W** deletes everything before the current
cursor position and **Control+U** deletes the
entire line. In `readline`,
**Control+W** deletes the word before the cursor
and **Control+U** deletes everything before the
current cursor position. If [**mysql**](mysql.md "6.5.1 mysql — The MySQL Command-Line Client") was built
using `libedit`, a user who prefers the
`readline` behavior for these two keys can put
the following lines in the `.editrc` file
(creating the file if necessary):

```terminal
bind "^W" ed-delete-prev-word
bind "^U" vi-kill-line-prev
```

To see the current set of key bindings, temporarily put a line
that says only `bind` at the end of
`.editrc`. [**mysql**](mysql.md "6.5.1 mysql — The MySQL Command-Line Client") shows the
bindings when it starts.

##### Disabling Interactive History

The **up-arrow** key enables you to recall input
lines from current and previous sessions. In cases where a
console is shared, this behavior may be unsuitable.
[**mysql**](mysql.md "6.5.1 mysql — The MySQL Command-Line Client") supports disabling the interactive
history partially or fully, depending on the host platform.

On Windows, the history is stored in memory.
**Alt+F7** deletes all input lines stored in memory
for the current history buffer. It also deletes the list of
sequential numbers in front of the input lines displayed with
**F7** and recalled (by number) with
**F9**. New input lines entered after you press
**Alt+F7** repopulate the current history buffer.
Clearing the buffer does not prevent logging to the Windows
Event Viewer, if the [`--syslog`](mysql-command-options.md#option_mysql_syslog)
option was used to start [**mysql**](mysql.md "6.5.1 mysql — The MySQL Command-Line Client"). Closing the
console window also clears the current history buffer.

To disable interactive history on Unix, first delete the
`.mysql_history` file, if it exists (previous
entries are recalled otherwise). Then start
[**mysql**](mysql.md "6.5.1 mysql — The MySQL Command-Line Client") with the
`--histignore="*"` option to ignore all new
input lines. To re-enable the recall (and logging) behavior,
restart [**mysql**](mysql.md "6.5.1 mysql — The MySQL Command-Line Client") without the option.

If you prevent the `.mysql_history` file from
being created (see [Controlling the History File](mysql-logging.md#mysql-logging-history-file "Controlling the History File"))
and use `--histignore="*"` to start the
[**mysql**](mysql.md "6.5.1 mysql — The MySQL Command-Line Client") client, the interactive history recall
facility is disabled fully. Alternatively, if you omit the
[`--histignore`](mysql-command-options.md#option_mysql_histignore) option, you can
recall the input lines entered during the current session.

##### Unicode Support on Windows

Windows provides APIs based on UTF-16LE for reading from and
writing to the console; the [**mysql**](mysql.md "6.5.1 mysql — The MySQL Command-Line Client") client for
Windows is able to use these APIs. The Windows installer creates
an item in the MySQL menu named `MySQL command line
client - Unicode`. This item invokes the
[**mysql**](mysql.md "6.5.1 mysql — The MySQL Command-Line Client") client with properties set to
communicate through the console to the MySQL server using
Unicode.

To take advantage of this support manually, run
[**mysql**](mysql.md "6.5.1 mysql — The MySQL Command-Line Client") within a console that uses a compatible
Unicode font and set the default character set to a Unicode
character set that is supported for communication with the
server:

1. Open a console window.
2. Go to the console window properties, select the font tab,
   and choose Lucida Console or some other compatible Unicode
   font. This is necessary because console windows start by
   default using a DOS raster font that is inadequate for
   Unicode.
3. Execute [**mysql.exe**](mysql.md "6.5.1 mysql — The MySQL Command-Line Client") with the
   [`--default-character-set=utf8mb4`](mysql-command-options.md#option_mysql_default-character-set)
   (or `utf8mb3`) option. This option is
   necessary because `utf16le` is one of the
   character sets that cannot be used as the client character
   set. See
   [Impermissible Client Character Sets](charset-connection.md#charset-connection-impermissible-client-charset "Impermissible Client Character Sets").

With those changes, [**mysql**](mysql.md "6.5.1 mysql — The MySQL Command-Line Client") uses the Windows
APIs to communicate with the console using UTF-16LE, and
communicate with the server using UTF-8. (The menu item
mentioned previously sets the font and character set as just
described.)

To avoid those steps each time you run [**mysql**](mysql.md "6.5.1 mysql — The MySQL Command-Line Client"),
you can create a shortcut that invokes
[**mysql.exe**](mysql.md "6.5.1 mysql — The MySQL Command-Line Client"). The shortcut should set the
console font to Lucida Console or some other compatible Unicode
font, and pass the
[`--default-character-set=utf8mb4`](mysql-command-options.md#option_mysql_default-character-set)
(or `utf8mb3`) option to
[**mysql.exe**](mysql.md "6.5.1 mysql — The MySQL Command-Line Client").

Alternatively, create a shortcut that only sets the console
font, and set the character set in the
`[mysql]` group of your
`my.ini` file:

```ini
[mysql]
default-character-set=utf8mb4   # or utf8mb3
```

##### Displaying Query Results Vertically

Some query results are much more readable when displayed
vertically, instead of in the usual horizontal table format.
Queries can be displayed vertically by terminating the query
with \G instead of a semicolon. For example, longer text values
that include newlines often are much easier to read with
vertical output:

```sql
mysql> SELECT * FROM mails WHERE LENGTH(txt) < 300 LIMIT 300,1\G
*************************** 1. row ***************************
  msg_nro: 3068
     date: 2000-03-01 23:29:50
time_zone: +0200
mail_from: Jones
    reply: jones@example.com
  mail_to: "John Smith" <smith@example.com>
      sbj: UTF-8
      txt: >>>>> "John" == John Smith writes:

John> Hi.  I think this is a good idea.  Is anyone familiar
John> with UTF-8 or Unicode? Otherwise, I'll put this on my
John> TODO list and see what happens.

Yes, please do that.

##### Using Safe-Updates Mode (--safe-updates)

For beginners, a useful startup option is
[`--safe-updates`](mysql-command-options.md#option_mysql_safe-updates) (or
[`--i-am-a-dummy`](mysql-command-options.md#option_mysql_safe-updates),
which has the same effect). Safe-updates mode is helpful for
cases when you might have issued an
[`UPDATE`](update.md "15.2.17 UPDATE Statement") or
[`DELETE`](delete.md "15.2.2 DELETE Statement") statement but forgotten
the `WHERE` clause indicating which rows to
modify. Normally, such statements update or delete all rows in
the table. With [`--safe-updates`](mysql-command-options.md#option_mysql_safe-updates),
you can modify rows only by specifying the key values that
identify them, or a `LIMIT` clause, or both.
This helps prevent accidents. Safe-updates mode also restricts
[`SELECT`](select.md "15.2.13 SELECT Statement") statements that produce
(or are estimated to produce) very large result sets.

The [`--safe-updates`](mysql-command-options.md#option_mysql_safe-updates) option causes
[**mysql**](mysql.md "6.5.1 mysql — The MySQL Command-Line Client") to execute the following statement when
it connects to the MySQL server, to set the session values of
the [`sql_safe_updates`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_sql_safe_updates),
[`sql_select_limit`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_sql_select_limit), and
[`max_join_size`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_max_join_size) system variables:

```sql
SET sql_safe_updates=1, sql_select_limit=1000, max_join_size=1000000;
```

The [`SET`](set-variable.md "15.7.6.1 SET Syntax for Variable Assignment")
statement affects statement processing as follows:

- Enabling [`sql_safe_updates`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_sql_safe_updates)
  causes [`UPDATE`](update.md "15.2.17 UPDATE Statement") and
  [`DELETE`](delete.md "15.2.2 DELETE Statement") statements to produce
  an error if they do not specify a key constraint in the
  `WHERE` clause, or provide a
  `LIMIT` clause, or both. For example:

  ```sql
  UPDATE tbl_name SET not_key_column=val WHERE key_column=val;

  UPDATE tbl_name SET not_key_column=val LIMIT 1;
  ```
- Setting [`sql_select_limit`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_sql_select_limit) to
  1,000 causes the server to limit all
  [`SELECT`](select.md "15.2.13 SELECT Statement") result sets to 1,000
  rows unless the statement includes a
  `LIMIT` clause.
- Setting [`max_join_size`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_max_join_size) to
  1,000,000 causes multiple-table
  [`SELECT`](select.md "15.2.13 SELECT Statement") statements to produce
  an error if the server estimates it must examine more than
  1,000,000 row combinations.

To specify result set limits different from 1,000 and 1,000,000,
you can override the defaults by using the
[`--select-limit`](mysql-command-options.md#option_mysql_select-limit) and
[`--max-join-size`](mysql-command-options.md#option_mysql_max-join-size) options when you
invoke [**mysql**](mysql.md "6.5.1 mysql — The MySQL Command-Line Client"):

```terminal
mysql --safe-updates --select-limit=500 --max-join-size=10000
```

It is possible for [`UPDATE`](update.md "15.2.17 UPDATE Statement") and
[`DELETE`](delete.md "15.2.2 DELETE Statement") statements to produce an
error in safe-updates mode even with a key specified in the
`WHERE` clause, if the optimizer decides not to
use the index on the key column:

- Range access on the index cannot be used if memory usage
  exceeds that permitted by the
  [`range_optimizer_max_mem_size`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_range_optimizer_max_mem_size)
  system variable. The optimizer then falls back to a table
  scan. See [Limiting Memory Use for Range Optimization](range-optimization.md#range-optimization-memory-use "Limiting Memory Use for Range Optimization").
- If key comparisons require type conversion, the index may
  not be used (see [Section 10.3.1, “How MySQL Uses Indexes”](mysql-indexes.md "10.3.1 How MySQL Uses Indexes")). Suppose
  that an indexed string column `c1` is
  compared to a numeric value using `WHERE c1 =
  2222`. For such comparisons, the string value is
  converted to a number and the operands are compared
  numerically (see [Section 14.3, “Type Conversion in Expression Evaluation”](type-conversion.md "14.3 Type Conversion in Expression Evaluation")),
  preventing use of the index. If safe-updates mode is
  enabled, an error occurs.

As of MySQL 8.0.13, safe-updates mode also includes these
behaviors:

- [`EXPLAIN`](explain.md "15.8.2 EXPLAIN Statement") with
  [`UPDATE`](update.md "15.2.17 UPDATE Statement") and
  [`DELETE`](delete.md "15.2.2 DELETE Statement") statements does not
  produce safe-updates errors. This enables use of
  [`EXPLAIN`](explain.md "15.8.2 EXPLAIN Statement") plus
  [`SHOW WARNINGS`](show-warnings.md "15.7.7.42 SHOW WARNINGS Statement") to see why an
  index is not used, which can be helpful in cases such as
  when a
  [`range_optimizer_max_mem_size`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_range_optimizer_max_mem_size)
  violation or type conversion occurs and the optimizer does
  not use an index even though a key column was specified in
  the `WHERE` clause.
- When a safe-updates error occurs, the error message includes
  the first diagnostic that was produced, to provide
  information about the reason for failure. For example, the
  message may indicate that the
  [`range_optimizer_max_mem_size`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_range_optimizer_max_mem_size)
  value was exceeded or type conversion occurred, either of
  which can preclude use of an index.
- For multiple-table deletes and updates, an error is produced
  with safe updates enabled only if any target table uses a
  table scan.

##### Disabling mysql Auto-Reconnect

If the [**mysql**](mysql.md "6.5.1 mysql — The MySQL Command-Line Client") client loses its connection to
the server while sending a statement, it immediately and
automatically tries to reconnect once to the server and send the
statement again. However, even if [**mysql**](mysql.md "6.5.1 mysql — The MySQL Command-Line Client")
succeeds in reconnecting, your first connection has ended and
all your previous session objects and settings are lost:
temporary tables, the autocommit mode, and user-defined and
session variables. Also, any current transaction rolls back.
This behavior may be dangerous for you, as in the following
example where the server was shut down and restarted between the
first and second statements without you knowing it:

```sql
mysql> SET @a=1;
Query OK, 0 rows affected (0.05 sec)

mysql> INSERT INTO t VALUES(@a);
ERROR 2006: MySQL server has gone away
No connection. Trying to reconnect...
Connection id:    1
Current database: test

Query OK, 1 row affected (1.30 sec)

mysql> SELECT * FROM t;
+------+
| a    |
+------+
| NULL |
+------+
1 row in set (0.05 sec)
```

The `@a` user variable has been lost with the
connection, and after the reconnection it is undefined. If it is
important to have [**mysql**](mysql.md "6.5.1 mysql — The MySQL Command-Line Client") terminate with an
error if the connection has been lost, you can start the
[**mysql**](mysql.md "6.5.1 mysql — The MySQL Command-Line Client") client with the
[`--skip-reconnect`](mysql-command-options.md#option_mysql_reconnect)
option.

For more information about auto-reconnect and its effect on
state information when a reconnection occurs, see
[Automatic Reconnection Control](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/c-api/8.0/en/c-api-auto-reconnect.html).

##### mysql Client Parser Versus Server Parser

The [**mysql**](mysql.md "6.5.1 mysql — The MySQL Command-Line Client") client uses a parser on the client
side that is not a duplicate of the complete parser used by the
[**mysqld**](mysqld.md "6.3.1 mysqld — The MySQL Server") server on the server side. This can
lead to differences in treatment of certain constructs.
Examples:

- The server parser treats strings delimited by
  `"` characters as identifiers rather than
  as plain strings if the
  [`ANSI_QUOTES`](sql-mode.md#sqlmode_ansi_quotes) SQL mode is
  enabled.

  The [**mysql**](mysql.md "6.5.1 mysql — The MySQL Command-Line Client") client parser does not take the
  `ANSI_QUOTES` SQL mode into account. It
  treats strings delimited by `"`,
  `'`, and `` ` `` characters
  the same, regardless of whether
  [`ANSI_QUOTES`](sql-mode.md#sqlmode_ansi_quotes) is enabled.
- Within `/*! ... */` and `/*+ ...
  */` comments, the [**mysql**](mysql.md "6.5.1 mysql — The MySQL Command-Line Client") client
  parser interprets short-form [**mysql**](mysql.md "6.5.1 mysql — The MySQL Command-Line Client")
  commands. The server parser does not interpret them because
  these commands have no meaning on the server side.

  If it is desirable for [**mysql**](mysql.md "6.5.1 mysql — The MySQL Command-Line Client") not to
  interpret short-form commands within comments, a partial
  workaround is to use the
  [`--binary-mode`](mysql-command-options.md#option_mysql_binary-mode) option, which
  causes all [**mysql**](mysql.md "6.5.1 mysql — The MySQL Command-Line Client") commands to be disabled
  except `\C` and `\d` in
  noninteractive mode (for input piped to
  [**mysql**](mysql.md "6.5.1 mysql — The MySQL Command-Line Client") or loaded using the
  `source` command).
