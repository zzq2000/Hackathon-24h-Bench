#### 15.2.15.12 Restrictions on Subqueries

- In general, you cannot modify a table and select from the
  same table in a subquery. For example, this limitation
  applies to statements of the following forms:

  ```sql
  DELETE FROM t WHERE ... (SELECT ... FROM t ...);
  UPDATE t ... WHERE col = (SELECT ... FROM t ...);
  {INSERT|REPLACE} INTO t (SELECT ... FROM t ...);
  ```

  Exception: The preceding prohibition does not apply if for
  the modified table you are using a derived table and that
  derived table is materialized rather than merged into the
  outer query. (See
  [Section 10.2.2.4, “Optimizing Derived Tables, View References, and Common Table Expressions
  with Merging or Materialization”](derived-table-optimization.md "10.2.2.4 Optimizing Derived Tables, View References, and Common Table Expressions with Merging or Materialization").) Example:

  ```sql
  UPDATE t ... WHERE col = (SELECT * FROM (SELECT ... FROM t...) AS dt ...);
  ```

  Here the result from the derived table is materialized as a
  temporary table, so the relevant rows in
  `t` have already been selected by the time
  the update to `t` takes place.

  In general, you may be able to influence the optimizer to
  materialize a derived table by adding a
  [`NO_MERGE`](optimizer-hints.md#optimizer-hints-table-level "Table-Level Optimizer Hints") optimizer hint.
  See [Section 10.9.3, “Optimizer Hints”](optimizer-hints.md "10.9.3 Optimizer Hints").
- Row comparison operations are only partially supported:

  - For `expr [NOT] IN
    subquery`,
    *`expr`* can be an
    *`n`*-tuple (specified using row
    constructor syntax) and the subquery can return rows of
    *`n`*-tuples. The permitted
    syntax is therefore more specifically expressed as
    `row_constructor
    [NOT] IN
    table_subquery`
  - For `expr
    op {ALL|ANY|SOME}
    subquery`,
    *`expr`* must be a scalar value
    and the subquery must be a column subquery; it cannot
    return multiple-column rows.

  In other words, for a subquery that returns rows of
  *`n`*-tuples, this is supported:

  ```sql
  (expr_1, ..., expr_n) [NOT] IN table_subquery
  ```

  But this is not supported:

  ```sql
  (expr_1, ..., expr_n) op {ALL|ANY|SOME} subquery
  ```

  The reason for supporting row comparisons for
  `IN` but not for the others is that
  `IN` is implemented by rewriting it as a
  sequence of [`=`](comparison-operators.md#operator_equal)
  comparisons and [`AND`](logical-operators.md#operator_and) operations.
  This approach cannot be used for `ALL`,
  `ANY`, or `SOME`.
- Prior to MySQL 8.0.14, subqueries in the
  `FROM` clause cannot be correlated
  subqueries. They are materialized in whole (evaluated to
  produce a result set) during query execution, so they cannot
  be evaluated per row of the outer query. The optimizer
  delays materialization until the result is needed, which may
  permit materialization to be avoided. See
  [Section 10.2.2.4, “Optimizing Derived Tables, View References, and Common Table Expressions
  with Merging or Materialization”](derived-table-optimization.md "10.2.2.4 Optimizing Derived Tables, View References, and Common Table Expressions with Merging or Materialization").
- MySQL does not support `LIMIT` in
  subqueries for certain subquery operators:

  ```sql
  mysql> SELECT * FROM t1
         WHERE s1 IN (SELECT s2 FROM t2 ORDER BY s1 LIMIT 1);
  ERROR 1235 (42000): This version of MySQL doesn't yet support
   'LIMIT & IN/ALL/ANY/SOME subquery'
  ```

  See [Section 15.2.15.10, “Subquery Errors”](subquery-errors.md "15.2.15.10 Subquery Errors").
- MySQL permits a subquery to refer to a stored function that
  has data-modifying side effects such as inserting rows into
  a table. For example, if `f()` inserts
  rows, the following query can modify data:

  ```sql
  SELECT ... WHERE x IN (SELECT f() ...);
  ```

  This behavior is an extension to the SQL standard. In MySQL,
  it can produce nondeterministic results because
  `f()` might be executed a different number
  of times for different executions of a given query depending
  on how the optimizer chooses to handle it.

  For statement-based or mixed-format replication, one
  implication of this indeterminism is that such a query can
  produce different results on the source and its replicas.
