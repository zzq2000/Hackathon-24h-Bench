### 25.5.23 ndb\_restore — Restore an NDB Cluster Backup

[25.5.23.1 Restoring an NDB Backup to a Different Version of NDB Cluster](ndb-restore-to-different-version.md)

[25.5.23.2 Restoring to a different number of data nodes](ndb-restore-different-number-nodes.md)

[25.5.23.3 Restoring from a backup taken in parallel](ndb-restore-parallel-data-node-backup.md)

The NDB Cluster restoration program is implemented as a separate
command-line utility [**ndb\_restore**](mysql-cluster-programs-ndb-restore.md "25.5.23 ndb_restore — Restore an NDB Cluster Backup"), which can
normally be found in the MySQL `bin`
directory. This program reads the files created as a result of
the backup and inserts the stored information into the database.

In NDB 7.6 and earlier, this program printed
`NDBT_ProgramExit -
status` upon completion of
its run, due to an unnecessary dependency on the
`NDBT` testing library. This dependency has
been removed in NDB 8.0, eliminating the extraneous output.

[**ndb\_restore**](mysql-cluster-programs-ndb-restore.md "25.5.23 ndb_restore — Restore an NDB Cluster Backup") must be executed once for each of
the backup files that were created by the
[`START BACKUP`](mysql-cluster-backup-using-management-client.md "25.6.8.2 Using The NDB Cluster Management Client to Create a Backup") command used to
create the backup (see
[Section 25.6.8.2, “Using The NDB Cluster Management Client to Create a Backup”](mysql-cluster-backup-using-management-client.md "25.6.8.2 Using The NDB Cluster Management Client to Create a Backup")).
This is equal to the number of data nodes in the cluster at the
time that the backup was created.

Note

Before using [**ndb\_restore**](mysql-cluster-programs-ndb-restore.md "25.5.23 ndb_restore — Restore an NDB Cluster Backup"), it is recommended
that the cluster be running in single user mode, unless you
are restoring multiple data nodes in parallel. See
[Section 25.6.6, “NDB Cluster Single User Mode”](mysql-cluster-single-user-mode.md "25.6.6 NDB Cluster Single User Mode"), for more
information.

Options that can be used with [**ndb\_restore**](mysql-cluster-programs-ndb-restore.md "25.5.23 ndb_restore — Restore an NDB Cluster Backup") are
shown in the following table. Additional descriptions follow the
table.

- [`--allow-pk-changes`](mysql-cluster-programs-ndb-restore.md#option_ndb_restore_allow-pk-changes)

  |  |  |
  | --- | --- |
  | Command-Line Format | `--allow-pk-changes[=0|1]` |
  | Introduced | 8.0.21-ndb-8.0.21 |
  | Type | Integer |
  | Default Value | `0` |
  | Minimum Value | `0` |
  | Maximum Value | `1` |

  When this option is set to `1`,
  [**ndb\_restore**](mysql-cluster-programs-ndb-restore.md "25.5.23 ndb_restore — Restore an NDB Cluster Backup") allows the primary keys in a
  table definition to differ from that of the same table in
  the backup. This may be desirable when backing up and
  restoring between different schema versions with primary key
  changes on one or more tables, and it appears that
  performing the restore operation using ndb\_restore is
  simpler or more efficient than issuing many
  [`ALTER TABLE`](alter-table.md "15.1.9 ALTER TABLE Statement") statements after
  restoring table schemas and data.

  The following changes in primary key definitions are
  supported by `--allow-pk-changes`:

  - **Extending the primary
    key**: A non-nullable column that exists in the
    table schema in the backup becomes part of the
    table's primary key in the database.

    Important

    When extending a table's primary key, any columns
    which become part of primary key must not be updated
    while the backup is being taken; any such updates
    discovered by [**ndb\_restore**](mysql-cluster-programs-ndb-restore.md "25.5.23 ndb_restore — Restore an NDB Cluster Backup") cause the
    restore operation to fail, even when no change in
    value takes place. In some cases, it may be possible
    to override this behavior using the
    [`--ignore-extended-pk-updates`](mysql-cluster-programs-ndb-restore.md#option_ndb_restore_ignore-extended-pk-updates)
    option; see the description of this option for more
    information.
  - **Contracting the primary key
    (1)**: A column that is already part of the
    table's primary key in the backup schema is no
    longer part of the primary key, but remains in the
    table.
  - **Contracting the primary key
    (2)**: A column that is already part of the
    table's primary key in the backup schema is removed
    from the table entirely.

  These differences can be combined with other schema
  differences supported by [**ndb\_restore**](mysql-cluster-programs-ndb-restore.md "25.5.23 ndb_restore — Restore an NDB Cluster Backup"),
  including changes to blob and text columns requiring the use
  of staging tables.

  Basic steps in a typical scenario using primary key schema
  changes are listed here:

  1. Restore table schemas using
     [**ndb\_restore**](mysql-cluster-programs-ndb-restore.md "25.5.23 ndb_restore — Restore an NDB Cluster Backup")
     [`--restore-meta`](mysql-cluster-programs-ndb-restore.md#option_ndb_restore_restore-meta)
  2. Alter schema to that desired, or create it
  3. Back up the desired schema
  4. Run [**ndb\_restore**](mysql-cluster-programs-ndb-restore.md "25.5.23 ndb_restore — Restore an NDB Cluster Backup")
     [`--disable-indexes`](mysql-cluster-programs-ndb-restore.md#option_ndb_restore_disable-indexes)
     using the backup from the previous step, to drop indexes
     and constraints
  5. Run [**ndb\_restore**](mysql-cluster-programs-ndb-restore.md "25.5.23 ndb_restore — Restore an NDB Cluster Backup")
     [`--allow-pk-changes`](mysql-cluster-programs-ndb-restore.md#option_ndb_restore_allow-pk-changes)
     (possibly along with
     [`--ignore-extended-pk-updates`](mysql-cluster-programs-ndb-restore.md#option_ndb_restore_ignore-extended-pk-updates),
     [`--disable-indexes`](mysql-cluster-programs-ndb-restore.md#option_ndb_restore_disable-indexes),
     and possibly other options as needed) to restore all
     data
  6. Run [**ndb\_restore**](mysql-cluster-programs-ndb-restore.md "25.5.23 ndb_restore — Restore an NDB Cluster Backup")
     [`--rebuild-indexes`](mysql-cluster-programs-ndb-restore.md#option_ndb_restore_rebuild-indexes)
     using the backup made with the desired schema, to
     rebuild indexes and constraints

  When extending the primary key, it may be necessary for
  [**ndb\_restore**](mysql-cluster-programs-ndb-restore.md "25.5.23 ndb_restore — Restore an NDB Cluster Backup") to use a temporary secondary
  unique index during the restore operation to map from the
  old primary key to the new one. Such an index is created
  only when necessary to apply events from the backup log to a
  table which has an extended primary key. This index is named
  `NDB$RESTORE_PK_MAPPING`, and is created on
  each table requiring it; it can be shared, if necessary, by
  multiple instances of [**ndb\_restore**](mysql-cluster-programs-ndb-restore.md "25.5.23 ndb_restore — Restore an NDB Cluster Backup")
  instances running in parallel. (Running
  [**ndb\_restore**](mysql-cluster-programs-ndb-restore.md "25.5.23 ndb_restore — Restore an NDB Cluster Backup")
  [`--rebuild-indexes`](mysql-cluster-programs-ndb-restore.md#option_ndb_restore_rebuild-indexes) at the
  end of the restore process causes this index to be dropped.)
- [`--append`](mysql-cluster-programs-ndb-restore.md#option_ndb_restore_append)

  |  |  |
  | --- | --- |
  | Command-Line Format | `--append` |

  When used with the [`--tab`](mysql-cluster-programs-ndb-restore.md#option_ndb_restore_tab)
  and [`--print-data`](mysql-cluster-programs-ndb-restore.md#option_ndb_restore_print-data)
  options, this causes the data to be appended to any existing
  files having the same names.
- [`--backup-path`](mysql-cluster-programs-ndb-restore.md#option_ndb_restore_backup-path)=*`dir_name`*

  |  |  |
  | --- | --- |
  | Command-Line Format | `--backup-path=path` |
  | Type | Directory name |
  | Default Value | `./` |

  The path to the backup directory is required; this is
  supplied to [**ndb\_restore**](mysql-cluster-programs-ndb-restore.md "25.5.23 ndb_restore — Restore an NDB Cluster Backup") using the
  `--backup-path` option, and must include the
  subdirectory corresponding to the ID backup of the backup to
  be restored. For example, if the data node's
  [`DataDir`](mysql-cluster-ndbd-definition.md#ndbparam-ndbd-datadir) is
  `/var/lib/mysql-cluster`, then the backup
  directory is
  `/var/lib/mysql-cluster/BACKUP`, and the
  backup files for the backup with the ID 3 can be found in
  `/var/lib/mysql-cluster/BACKUP/BACKUP-3`.
  The path may be absolute or relative to the directory in
  which the [**ndb\_restore**](mysql-cluster-programs-ndb-restore.md "25.5.23 ndb_restore — Restore an NDB Cluster Backup") executable is
  located, and may be optionally prefixed with
  `backup-path=`.

  It is possible to restore a backup to a database with a
  different configuration than it was created from. For
  example, suppose that a backup with backup ID
  `12`, created in a cluster with two storage
  nodes having the node IDs `2` and
  `3`, is to be restored to a cluster with
  four nodes. Then [**ndb\_restore**](mysql-cluster-programs-ndb-restore.md "25.5.23 ndb_restore — Restore an NDB Cluster Backup") must be run
  twice—once for each storage node in the cluster where
  the backup was taken. However,
  [**ndb\_restore**](mysql-cluster-programs-ndb-restore.md "25.5.23 ndb_restore — Restore an NDB Cluster Backup") cannot always restore backups
  made from a cluster running one version of MySQL to a
  cluster running a different MySQL version. See
  [Section 25.3.7, “Upgrading and Downgrading NDB Cluster”](mysql-cluster-upgrade-downgrade.md "25.3.7 Upgrading and Downgrading NDB Cluster"), for more
  information.

  Important

  It is not possible to restore a backup made from a newer
  version of NDB Cluster using an older version of
  [**ndb\_restore**](mysql-cluster-programs-ndb-restore.md "25.5.23 ndb_restore — Restore an NDB Cluster Backup"). You can restore a backup
  made from a newer version of MySQL to an older cluster,
  but you must use a copy of [**ndb\_restore**](mysql-cluster-programs-ndb-restore.md "25.5.23 ndb_restore — Restore an NDB Cluster Backup")
  from the newer NDB Cluster version to do so.

  For example, to restore a cluster backup taken from a
  cluster running NDB Cluster 8.0.44 to a
  cluster running NDB Cluster 7.6.36, you
  must use the [**ndb\_restore**](mysql-cluster-programs-ndb-restore.md "25.5.23 ndb_restore — Restore an NDB Cluster Backup") that comes
  with the NDB Cluster 7.6.36
  distribution.

  For more rapid restoration, the data may be restored in
  parallel, provided that there is a sufficient number of
  cluster connections available. That is, when restoring to
  multiple nodes in parallel, you must have an
  `[api]` or `[mysqld]`
  section in the cluster `config.ini` file
  available for each concurrent [**ndb\_restore**](mysql-cluster-programs-ndb-restore.md "25.5.23 ndb_restore — Restore an NDB Cluster Backup")
  process. However, the data files must always be applied
  before the logs.
- [`--backup-password=password`](mysql-cluster-programs-ndb-restore.md#option_ndb_restore_backup-password)

  |  |  |
  | --- | --- |
  | Command-Line Format | `--backup-password=password` |
  | Introduced | 8.0.22-ndb-8.0.22 |
  | Type | String |
  | Default Value | `[none]` |

  This option specifies a password to be used when decrypting
  an encrypted backup with the
  [`--decrypt`](mysql-cluster-programs-ndb-restore.md#option_ndb_restore_decrypt) option. This
  must be the same password that was used to encrypt the
  backup.

  The password must be 1 to 256 characters in length, and must
  be enclosed by single or double quotation marks. It can
  contain any of the ASCII characters having character codes
  32, 35, 38, 40-91, 93, 95, and 97-126; in other words, it
  can use any printable ASCII characters except for
  `!`, `'`,
  `"`, `$`,
  `%`, `\`, and
  `^`.

  In MySQL 8.0.24 and later, it is possible to omit the
  password, in which case [**ndb\_restore**](mysql-cluster-programs-ndb-restore.md "25.5.23 ndb_restore — Restore an NDB Cluster Backup") waits
  for it to be supplied from `stdin`, as when
  using
  [`--backup-password-from-stdin`](mysql-cluster-programs-ndb-restore.md#option_ndb_restore_backup-password-from-stdin).
- [`--backup-password-from-stdin[=TRUE|FALSE]`](mysql-cluster-programs-ndb-restore.md#option_ndb_restore_backup-password-from-stdin)

  |  |  |
  | --- | --- |
  | Command-Line Format | `--backup-password-from-stdin` |
  | Introduced | 8.0.24-ndb-8.0.24 |

  When used in place of
  [`--backup-password`](mysql-cluster-programs-ndb-restore.md#option_ndb_restore_backup-password), this
  option enables input of the backup password from the system
  shell (`stdin`), similar to how this is
  done when supplying the password interactively to
  [**mysql**](mysql.md "6.5.1 mysql — The MySQL Command-Line Client") when using the
  [`--password`](mysql-command-options.md#option_mysql_password) without supplying
  the password on the command line.
- [`--backupid`](mysql-cluster-programs-ndb-restore.md#option_ndb_restore_backupid)=*`#`*,
  `-b`

  |  |  |
  | --- | --- |
  | Command-Line Format | `--backupid=#` |
  | Type | Numeric |
  | Default Value | `none` |

  This option is used to specify the ID or sequence number of
  the backup, and is the same number shown by the management
  client in the `Backup
  backup_id completed`
  message displayed upon completion of a backup. (See
  [Section 25.6.8.2, “Using The NDB Cluster Management Client to Create a Backup”](mysql-cluster-backup-using-management-client.md "25.6.8.2 Using The NDB Cluster Management Client to Create a Backup").)

  Important

  When restoring cluster backups, you must be sure to
  restore all data nodes from backups having the same backup
  ID. Using files from different backups results at best in
  restoring the cluster to an inconsistent state, and is
  likely to fail altogether.

  In NDB 8.0, this option is required.
- [`--character-sets-dir`](mysql-cluster-programs-ndb-restore.md#option_ndb_restore_character-sets-dir)

  |  |  |
  | --- | --- |
  | Command-Line Format | `--character-sets-dir=path` |
  | Removed | 8.0.31 |

  Directory containing character sets.
- [`--connect`](mysql-cluster-programs-ndb-restore.md#option_ndb_restore_connect),
  `-c`

  |  |  |
  | --- | --- |
  | Command-Line Format | `--connect=connection_string` |
  | Type | String |
  | Default Value | `localhost:1186` |

  Alias for
  [`--ndb-connectstring`](mysql-cluster-programs-ndb-restore.md#option_ndb_restore_ndb-connectstring).
- [`--connect-retries`](mysql-cluster-programs-ndb-restore.md#option_ndb_restore_connect-retries)

  |  |  |
  | --- | --- |
  | Command-Line Format | `--connect-retries=#` |
  | Type | Integer |
  | Default Value | `12` |
  | Minimum Value | `0` |

- [`--core-file`](mysql-cluster-programs-ndb-restore.md#option_ndb_restore_core-file)

  |  |  |
  | --- | --- |
  | Command-Line Format | `--core-file` |

  Write core file on error; used in debugging.
- [`--decrypt`](mysql-cluster-programs-ndb-restore.md#option_ndb_restore_decrypt)

  |  |  |

  | Default Value | `[none]` |

  Also read groups with concat(group, suffix).
- [`--disable-indexes`](mysql-cluster-programs-ndb-restore.md#option_ndb_restore_disable-indexes)

  |  |  |
  | --- | --- |
  | Command-Line Format | `--disable-indexes` |

  Disable restoration of indexes during restoration of the
  data from a native `NDB` backup.
  Afterwards, you can restore indexes for all tables at once
  with multithreaded building of indexes using
  [`--rebuild-indexes`](mysql-cluster-programs-ndb-restore.md#option_ndb_restore_rebuild-indexes), which
  should be faster than rebuilding indexes concurrently for
  very large tables.

  In NDB 8.0.27 and later, this option also drops any foreign
  keys specified in the backup.

  Prior to NDB 8.0.29, attempting to access from MySQL an
  `NDB` table for which one or more indexes
  could not be found was always rejected with error
  [`4243`](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/ndbapi/en/ndb-error-codes-application-error.html#ndberrno-4243) Index not
  found. Beginning with NDB 8.0.29, it is possible
  for MySQL to open such a table, provided the query does not
  use any of the affected indexes; otherwise the query is
  rejected with
  [`ER_NOT_KEYFILE`](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/mysql-errors/8.0/en/server-error-reference.html#error_er_not_keyfile). In the
  latter case, you can temporarily work around the problem by
  executing an [`ALTER TABLE`](alter-table.md "15.1.9 ALTER TABLE Statement")
  statement such as this one:

  ```sql
  ALTER TABLE tbl ALTER INDEX idx INVISIBLE;
  ```

  This causes MySQL to ignore the index `idx`
  on table `tbl`. See
  [Primary Keys and Indexes](alter-table.md#alter-table-index "Primary Keys and Indexes"), for more information.
- [`--dont-ignore-systab-0`](mysql-cluster-programs-ndb-restore.md#option_ndb_restore_dont-ignore-systab-0),
  `-f`

  |  |  |
  | --- | --- |
  | Command-Line Format | `--dont-ignore-systab-0` |

  Normally, when restoring table data and metadata,
  [**ndb\_restore**](mysql-cluster-programs-ndb-restore.md "25.5.23 ndb_restore — Restore an NDB Cluster Backup") ignores the copy of the
  [`NDB`](mysql-cluster.md "Chapter 25 MySQL NDB Cluster 8.0") system table that is
  present in the backup.
  `--dont-ignore-systab-0` causes the system
  table to be restored. *This option is intended for
  experimental and development use only, and is not
  recommended in a production environment*.
- [`--exclude-databases`](mysql-cluster-programs-ndb-restore.md#option_ndb_restore_exclude-databases)=*`db-list`*

  |  |  |
  | --- | --- |
  | Command-Line Format | `--exclude-databases=list` |
  | Type | String |
  | Default Value |  |

  Comma-delimited list of one or more databases which should
  not be restored.

  This option is often used in combination with
  [`--exclude-tables`](mysql-cluster-programs-ndb-restore.md#option_ndb_restore_exclude-tables); see
  that option's description for further information and
  examples.
- [`--exclude-intermediate-sql-tables[`](mysql-cluster-programs-ndb-restore.md#option_ndb_restore_exclude-intermediate-sql-tables)=*`TRUE|FALSE]`*

  |  |  |
  | --- | --- |
  | Command-Line Format | `--exclude-intermediate-sql-tables[=TRUE|FALSE]` |
  | Type | Boolean |
  | Default Value | `TRUE` |

  When performing copying [`ALTER
  TABLE`](alter-table.md "15.1.9 ALTER TABLE Statement") operations, [**mysqld**](mysqld.md "6.3.1 mysqld — The MySQL Server")
  creates intermediate tables (whose names are prefixed with
  `#sql-`). When `TRUE`, the
  `--exclude-intermediate-sql-tables` option
  keeps [**ndb\_restore**](mysql-cluster-programs-ndb-restore.md "25.5.23 ndb_restore — Restore an NDB Cluster Backup") from restoring such
  tables that may have been left over from these operations.
  This option is `TRUE` by default.
- [`--exclude-missing-columns`](mysql-cluster-programs-ndb-restore.md#option_ndb_restore_exclude-missing-columns)

  |  |  |
  | --- | --- |
  | Command-Line Format | `--exclude-missing-columns` |

  It is possible to restore only selected table columns using
  this option, which causes [**ndb\_restore**](mysql-cluster-programs-ndb-restore.md "25.5.23 ndb_restore — Restore an NDB Cluster Backup") to
  ignore any columns missing from tables being restored as
  compared to the versions of those tables found in the
  backup. This option applies to all tables being restored. If
  you wish to apply this option only to selected tables or
  databases, you can use it in combination with one or more of
  the `--include-*` or
  `--exclude-*` options described elsewhere in
  this section to do so, then restore data to the remaining
  tables using a complementary set of these options.
- [`--exclude-missing-tables`](mysql-cluster-programs-ndb-restore.md#option_ndb_restore_exclude-missing-tables)

  |  |  |
  | --- | --- |
  | Command-Line Format | `--exclude-missing-tables` |

  It is possible to restore only selected tables using this
  option, which causes [**ndb\_restore**](mysql-cluster-programs-ndb-restore.md "25.5.23 ndb_restore — Restore an NDB Cluster Backup") to
  ignore any tables from the backup that are not found in the
  target database.
- [`--exclude-tables`](mysql-cluster-programs-ndb-restore.md#option_ndb_restore_exclude-tables)=*`table-list`*

  |  |  |
  | --- | --- |
  | Command-Line Format | `--exclude-tables=list` |
  | Type | String |
  | Default Value |  |

  List of one or more tables to exclude; each table reference
  must include the database name. Often used together with
  [`--exclude-databases`](mysql-cluster-programs-ndb-restore.md#option_ndb_restore_exclude-databases).

  When [`--exclude-databases`](mysql-cluster-programs-ndb-restore.md#option_ndb_restore_exclude-databases)
  or `--exclude-tables` is used, only those
  databases or tables named by the option are excluded; all
  other databases and tables are restored by
  [**ndb\_restore**](mysql-cluster-programs-ndb-restore.md "25.5.23 ndb_restore — Restore an NDB Cluster Backup").

  This table shows several invocations of
  [**ndb\_restore**](mysql-cluster-programs-ndb-restore.md "25.5.23 ndb_restore — Restore an NDB Cluster Backup") using
  `--exclude-*` options (other options possibly
  required have been omitted for clarity), and the effects
  these options have on restoring from an NDB Cluster backup:

  **Table 25.43 Several invocations of ndb\_restore using --exclude-\*
  options, and the effects these options have on restoring from an
  NDB Cluster backup.**

  | Option | Result |
  | --- | --- |
  | `--exclude-databases=db1` | All tables in all databases except `db1` are restored; no tables in `db1` are restored |
  | `--exclude-databases=db1,db2` (or `--exclude-databases=db1` `--exclude-databases=db2`) | All tables in all databases except `db1` and `db2` are restored; no tables in `db1` or `db2` are restored |
  | `--exclude-tables=db1.t1` | All tables except `t1` in database `db1` are restored; all other tables in `db1` are restored; all tables in all other databases are restored |
  | `--exclude-tables=db1.t2,db2.t1` (or `--exclude-tables=db1.t2` `--exclude-tables=db2.t1)` | All tables in database `db1` except for `t2` and all tables in database `db2` except for table `t1` are restored; no other tables in `db1` or `db2` are restored; all tables in all other databases are restored |

  You can use these two options together. For example, the
  following causes all tables in all databases
  *except for* databases
  `db1` and `db2`, and
  tables `t1` and `t2` in
  database `db3`, to be restored:

  ```terminal
  $> ndb_restore [...] --exclude-databases=db1,db2 --exclude-tables=db3.t1,db3.t2
  ```

  (Again, we have omitted other possibly necessary options in
  the interest of clarity and brevity from the example just
  shown.)

  You can use `--include-*` and
  `--exclude-*` options together, subject to
  the following rules:

  - The actions of all `--include-*` and
    `--exclude-*` options are cumulative.
  - All `--include-*` and
    `--exclude-*` options are evaluated in
    the order passed to ndb\_restore, from right to left.
  - In the event of conflicting options, the first
    (rightmost) option takes precedence. In other words, the
    first option (going from right to left) that matches
    against a given database or table “wins”.

  For example, the following set of options causes
  [**ndb\_restore**](mysql-cluster-programs-ndb-restore.md "25.5.23 ndb_restore — Restore an NDB Cluster Backup") to restore all tables from
  database `db1` except
  `db1.t1`, while restoring no other tables
  from any other databases:

  ```terminal
  --include-databases=db1 --exclude-tables=db1.t1
  ```

  However, reversing the order of the options just given
  simply causes all tables from database
  `db1` to be restored (including
  `db1.t1`, but no tables from any other
  database), because the
  [`--include-databases`](mysql-cluster-programs-ndb-restore.md#option_ndb_restore_include-databases)
  option, being farthest to the right, is the first match
  against database `db1` and thus takes
  precedence over any other option that matches
  `db1` or any tables in
  `db1`:

  ```terminal
  --exclude-tables=db1.t1 --include-databases=db1
  ```
- [`--fields-enclosed-by`](mysql-cluster-programs-ndb-restore.md#option_ndb_restore_fields-enclosed-by)=*`char`*

  |  |  |
  | --- | --- |
  | Command-Line Format | `--fields-enclosed-by=char` |
  | Type | String |
  | Default Value |  |

  Each column value is enclosed by the string passed to this
  option (regardless of data type; see the description of
  [`--fields-optionally-enclosed-by`](mysql-cluster-programs-ndb-restore.md#option_ndb_restore_fields-optionally-enclosed-by)).
- [`--fields-optionally-enclosed-by`](mysql-cluster-programs-ndb-restore.md#option_ndb_restore_fields-optionally-enclosed-by)

  |  |  |
  | --- | --- |
  | Command-Line Format | `--fields-optionally-enclosed-by` |
  | Type | String |
  | Default Value |  |

  The string passed to this option is used to enclose column
  values containing character data (such as
  [`CHAR`](char.md "13.3.2 The CHAR and VARCHAR Types"),
  [`VARCHAR`](char.md "13.3.2 The CHAR and VARCHAR Types"),
  [`BINARY`](binary-varbinary.md "13.3.3 The BINARY and VARBINARY Types"),

  |  |  |
  | --- | --- |
  | Command-Line Format | `--fields-terminated-by=char` |
  | Type | String |
  | Default Value | `\t (tab)` |

  The string passed to this option is used to separate column
  values. The default value is a tab character
  (`\t`).
- [`--help`](mysql-cluster-programs-ndb-restore.md#option_ndb_restore_help)

  |  |  |
  | --- | --- |
  | Command-Line Format | `--help` |

- [`--hex`](mysql-cluster-programs-ndb-restore.md#option_ndb_restore_hex)

  |  |  |
  | --- | --- |
  | Command-Line Format | `--hex` |

  If this option is used, all binary values are output in
  hexadecimal format.
- [`--ignore-extended-pk-updates`](mysql-cluster-programs-ndb-restore.md#option_ndb_restore_ignore-extended-pk-updates)

  |  |  |
  | --- | --- |
  | Command-Line Format | `--ignore-extended-pk-updates[=0|1]` |
  | Introduced | 8.0.21-ndb-8.0.21 |
  | Type | Integer |
  | Default Value | `0` |
  | Minimum Value | `0` |
  | Maximum Value | `1` |

  When using
  [`--allow-pk-changes`](mysql-cluster-programs-ndb-restore.md#option_ndb_restore_allow-pk-changes),
  columns which become part of a table's primary key must
  not be updated while the backup is being taken; such columns
  should keep the same values from the time values are
  inserted into them until the rows containing the values are
  deleted. If [**ndb\_restore**](mysql-cluster-programs-ndb-restore.md "25.5.23 ndb_restore — Restore an NDB Cluster Backup") encounters
  updates to these columns when restoring a backup, the
  restore fails. Because some applications may set values for
  all columns when updating a row, even when some column
  values are not changed, the backup may include log events
  appearing to update columns which are not in fact modified.
  In such cases you can set
  `--ignore-extended-pk-updates` to
  `1`, forcing [**ndb\_restore**](mysql-cluster-programs-ndb-restore.md "25.5.23 ndb_restore — Restore an NDB Cluster Backup")
  to ignore such updates.

  Important

  When causing these updates to be ignored, the user is
  responsible for ensuring that there are no updates to the
  values of any columns that become part of the primary key.

  For more information, see the description of
  [`--allow-pk-changes`](mysql-cluster-programs-ndb-restore.md#option_ndb_restore_allow-pk-changes).

  | Command-Line Format | `--include-databases=list` |
  | Type | String |
  | Default Value |  |

  Comma-delimited list of one or more databases to restore.
  Often used together with
  [`--include-tables`](mysql-cluster-programs-ndb-restore.md#option_ndb_restore_include-tables); see
  the description of that option for further information and
  examples.
- [`--include-stored-grants`](mysql-cluster-programs-ndb-restore.md#option_ndb_restore_include-stored-grants)

  | --- | --- |
  | Command-Line Format | `--include-stored-grants` |
  | Introduced | 8.0.19-ndb-8.0.19 |

  In NDB 8.0, [**ndb\_restore**](mysql-cluster-programs-ndb-restore.md "25.5.23 ndb_restore — Restore an NDB Cluster Backup") does not by
  default restore shared users and grants (see
  [Section 25.6.13, “Privilege Synchronization and NDB\_STORED\_USER”](mysql-cluster-privilege-synchronization.md "25.6.13 Privilege Synchronization and NDB_STORED_USER"))
  to the `ndb_sql_metadata` table. Specifying
  this option causes it to do so.
- [`--include-tables`](mysql-cluster-programs-ndb-restore.md#option_ndb_restore_include-tables)=*`table-list`*

  |  |  |
  | --- | --- |
  | Command-Line Format | `--include-tables=list` |
  | Type | String |
  | Default Value |  |

  Comma-delimited list of tables to restore; each table
  reference must include the database name.

  When `--include-databases` or
  [`--include-tables`](mysql-cluster-programs-ndb-restore.md#option_ndb_restore_include-tables) is
  used, only those databases or tables named by the option are
  restored; all other databases and tables are excluded by
  [**ndb\_restore**](mysql-cluster-programs-ndb-restore.md "25.5.23 ndb_restore — Restore an NDB Cluster Backup"), and are not restored.

  The following table shows several invocations of
  [**ndb\_restore**](mysql-cluster-programs-ndb-restore.md "25.5.23 ndb_restore — Restore an NDB Cluster Backup") using
  `--include-*` options (other options possibly
  required have been omitted for clarity), and the effects
  these have on restoring from an NDB Cluster backup:

  **Table 25.44 Several invocations of ndb\_restore using --include-\*
  options, and their effects on restoring from an NDB Cluster
  backup.**

  | Option | Result |
  | --- | --- |
  | `--include-databases=db1` | Only tables in database `db1` are restored; all tables in all other databases are ignored |
  | `--include-databases=db1,db2` (or `--include-databases=db1` `--include-databases=db2`) | Only tables in databases `db1` and `db2` are restored; all tables in all other databases are ignored |
  | `--include-tables=db1.t1` | Only table `t1` in database `db1` is restored; no other tables in `db1` or in any other database are restored |
  | `--include-tables=db1.t2,db2.t1` (or `--include-tables=db1.t2` `--include-tables=db2.t1`) | Only the table `t2` in database `db1` and the table `t1` in database `db2` are restored; no other tables in `db1`, `db2`, or any other database are restored |

  You can also use these two options together. For example,
  the following causes all tables in databases
  `db1` and `db2`, together
  with the tables `t1` and
  `t2` in database `db3`, to
  be restored (and no other databases or tables):

  ```terminal
  $> ndb_restore [...] --include-databases=db1,db2 --include-tables=db3.t1,db3.t2
  ```

  (Again we have omitted other, possibly required, options in
  the example just shown.)

  It also possible to restore only selected databases, or
  selected tables from a single database, without any
  `--include-*` (or
  `--exclude-*`) options, using the syntax
  shown here:

  ```terminal
  ndb_restore other_options db_name,[db_name[,...] | tbl_name[,tbl_name][,...]]
  ```

  In other words, you can specify either of the following to
  be restored:

  - All tables from one or more databases
  - One or more tables from a single database
- [`--lines-terminated-by`](mysql-cluster-programs-ndb-restore.md#option_ndb_restore_lines-terminated-by)=*`char`*

  |  |  |
  | --- | --- |
  | Command-Line Format | `--lines-terminated-by=char` |
  | Type | String |
  | Default Value | `\n (linebreak)` |

  Specifies the string used to end each line of output. The
  default is a linefeed character (`\n`).
- [`--login-path`](mysql-cluster-programs-ndb-restore.md#option_ndb_restore_login-path)

  |  |  |
  | --- | --- |
  | Command-Line Format | `--login-path=path` |
  | Type | String |
  | Default Value | `[none]` |

  Read given path from login file.
- [`--lossy-conversions`](mysql-cluster-programs-ndb-restore.md#option_ndb_restore_lossy-conversions),
  `-L`

  |  |  |
  | --- | --- |
  | Command-Line Format | `--lossy-conversions` |

  This option is intended to complement the
  [`--promote-attributes`](mysql-cluster-programs-ndb-restore.md#option_ndb_restore_promote-attributes)
  option. Using `--lossy-conversions` allows
  lossy conversions of column values (type demotions or
  changes in sign) when restoring data from backup. With some
  exceptions, the rules governing demotion are the same as for
  MySQL replication; see
  [Section 19.5.1.9.2, “Replication of Columns Having Different Data Types”](replication-features-differing-tables.md#replication-features-different-data-types "19.5.1.9.2 Replication of Columns Having Different Data Types"),
  for information about specific type conversions currently
  supported by attribute demotion.

  Beginning with NDB 8.0.26, this option also makes it
  possible to restore a `NULL` column as
  `NOT NULL`. The column must not contain any
  `NULL` entries; otherwise
  [**ndb\_restore**](mysql-cluster-programs-ndb-restore.md "25.5.23 ndb_restore — Restore an NDB Cluster Backup") stops with an error.

  [**ndb\_restore**](mysql-cluster-programs-ndb-restore.md "25.5.23 ndb_restore — Restore an NDB Cluster Backup") reports any truncation of
  data that it performs during lossy conversions once per
  attribute and column.
- [`--no-binlog`](mysql-cluster-programs-ndb-restore.md#option_ndb_restore_no-binlog)

  |  |  |
  | --- | --- |
  | Command-Line Format | `--no-binlog` |

  This option prevents any connected SQL nodes from writing
  data restored by [**ndb\_restore**](mysql-cluster-programs-ndb-restore.md "25.5.23 ndb_restore — Restore an NDB Cluster Backup") to their
  binary logs.
- [`--no-restore-disk-objects`](mysql-cluster-programs-ndb-restore.md#option_ndb_restore_no-restore-disk-objects),
  `-d`

  |  |  |
  | --- | --- |
  | Command-Line Format | `--no-restore-disk-objects` |

  This option stops [**ndb\_restore**](mysql-cluster-programs-ndb-restore.md "25.5.23 ndb_restore — Restore an NDB Cluster Backup") from
  restoring any NDB Cluster Disk Data objects, such as
  tablespaces and log file groups; see
  [Section 25.6.11, “NDB Cluster Disk Data Tables”](mysql-cluster-disk-data.md "25.6.11 NDB Cluster Disk Data Tables"), for more
  information about these.
- [`--no-upgrade`](mysql-cluster-programs-ndb-restore.md#option_ndb_restore_no-upgrade),
  `-u`

  |  |  |
  | --- | --- |
  | Command-Line Format | `--no-upgrade` |

  When using [**ndb\_restore**](mysql-cluster-programs-ndb-restore.md "25.5.23 ndb_restore — Restore an NDB Cluster Backup") to restore a
  backup, [`VARCHAR`](char.md "13.3.2 The CHAR and VARCHAR Types") columns
  created using the old fixed format are resized and recreated
  using the variable-width format now employed. This behavior
  can be overridden by specifying
  `--no-upgrade`.
- [`--ndb-connectstring`](mysql-cluster-programs-ndb-restore.md#option_ndb_restore_ndb-connectstring)

  |  |  |
  | --- | --- |
  | Command-Line Format | `--ndb-connectstring=connection_string` |
  | Type | String |
  | Default Value | `[none]` |

  Set connect string for connecting to ndb\_mgmd. Syntax:
  "[nodeid=id;][host=]hostname[:port]". Overrides entries in
  NDB\_CONNECTSTRING and my.cnf.
- [`--ndb-mgmd-host`](mysql-cluster-programs-ndb-restore.md#option_ndb_restore_ndb-mgmd-host)

  |  |  |
  | --- | --- |
  | Command-Line Format | `--ndb-mgmd-host=connection_string` |
  | Type | String |
  | Default Value | `[none]` |

  Same as
  [`--ndb-connectstring`](mysql-cluster-programs-ndb-restore.md#option_ndb_restore_ndb-connectstring).
- [`--ndb-nodegroup-map`](mysql-cluster-programs-ndb-restore.md#option_ndb_restore_ndb-nodegroup-map)=*`map`*,
  `-z`

  |  |  |
  | --- | --- |
  | Command-Line Format | `--ndb-nodegroup-map=map` |

  Intended for restoring a backup taken from one node group to
  a different node group, but never completely implemented;
  unsupported.

  All code supporting this option was removed in NDB 8.0.27;
  in this and later versions, any value set for it is ignored,
  and the option itself does nothing.
- [`--ndb-nodeid`](mysql-cluster-programs-ndb-restore.md#option_ndb_restore_ndb-nodeid)

  |  |  |
  | --- | --- |
  | Command-Line Format | `--ndb-nodeid=#` |
  | Type | Integer |
  | Default Value | `[none]` |

  | Command-Line Format | `--nodeid=#` |
  | Type | Numeric |
  | Default Value | `none` |

  Specify the node ID of the data node on which the backup was
  taken.

  When restoring to a cluster with different number of data
  nodes from that where the backup was taken, this information
  helps identify the correct set or sets of files to be
  restored to a given node. (In such cases, multiple files
  usually need to be restored to a single data node.) See
  [Section 25.5.23.2, “Restoring to a different number of data nodes”](ndb-restore-different-number-nodes.md "25.5.23.2 Restoring to a different number of data nodes"), for
  additional information and examples.

  In NDB 8.0, this option is required.
- [`--num-slices`](mysql-cluster-programs-ndb-restore.md#option_ndb_restore_num-slices)=*`#`*

  |  |  |
  | --- | --- |
  | Command-Line Format | `--num-slices=#` |
  | Introduced | 8.0.20-ndb-8.0.20 |
  | Type | Integer |
  | Default Value | `1` |
  | Minimum Value | `1` |
  | Maximum Value | `1024` |

  When restoring a backup by slices, this option sets the
  number of slices into which to divide the backup. This
  allows multiple instances of [**ndb\_restore**](mysql-cluster-programs-ndb-restore.md "25.5.23 ndb_restore — Restore an NDB Cluster Backup")
  to restore disjoint subsets in parallel, potentially
  reducing the amount of time required to perform the restore
  operation.

  A *slice* is a subset of the data in a
  given backup; that is, it is a set of fragments having the
  same slice ID, specified using the
  [`--slice-id`](mysql-cluster-programs-ndb-restore.md#option_ndb_restore_slice-id) option. The
  two options must always be used together, and the value set
  by `--slice-id` must always be less than the
  number of slices.

  [**ndb\_restore**](mysql-cluster-programs-ndb-restore.md "25.5.23 ndb_restore — Restore an NDB Cluster Backup") encounters fragments and
  assigns each one a fragment counter. When restoring by
  slices, a slice ID is assigned to each fragment; this slice
  ID is in the range 0 to 1 less than the number of slices.
  For a table that is not a
  [`BLOB`](blob.md "13.3.4 The BLOB and TEXT Types") table, the slice to
  which a given fragment belongs is determined using the
  formula shown here:

  ```simple
  [slice_ID] = [fragment_counter] % [number_of_slices]
  ```

  For a [`BLOB`](blob.md "13.3.4 The BLOB and TEXT Types") table, a fragment
  counter is not used; the fragment number is used instead,
  along with the ID of the main table for the
  `BLOB` table (recall that
  `NDB` stores
  *`BLOB`* values in a separate table
  internally). In this case, the slice ID for a given fragment
  is calculated as shown here:

  ```simple
  [slice_ID] =
  ([main_table_ID] + [fragment_ID]) % [number_of_slices]
  ```

  Thus, restoring by *`N`* slices means
  running *`N`* instances of
  [**ndb\_restore**](mysql-cluster-programs-ndb-restore.md "25.5.23 ndb_restore — Restore an NDB Cluster Backup"), all with
  `--num-slices=N`
  (along with any other necessary options) and one each with
  [`--slice-id=1`](mysql-cluster-programs-ndb-restore.md#option_ndb_restore_slice-id),
  `--slice-id=2`,
  `--slice-id=3`, and so on through
  `slice-id=N-1`.

  **Example.**
  Assume that you want to restore a backup named
  `BACKUP-1`, found in the default
  directory
  `/var/lib/mysql-cluster/BACKUP/BACKUP-3`
  on the node file system on each data node, to a cluster
  with four data nodes having the node IDs 1, 2, 3, and 4.
  To perform this operation using five slices, execute the
  sets of commands shown in the following list:

  1. Restore the cluster metadata using
     [**ndb\_restore**](mysql-cluster-programs-ndb-restore.md "25.5.23 ndb_restore — Restore an NDB Cluster Backup") as shown here:

     ```terminal
     $> ndb_restore -b 1 -n 1 -m --disable-indexes --backup-path=/home/ndbuser/backups
     ```
  2. Restore the cluster data to the data nodes invoking
     [**ndb\_restore**](mysql-cluster-programs-ndb-restore.md "25.5.23 ndb_restore — Restore an NDB Cluster Backup") as shown here:

     ```terminal
     $> ndb_restore -b 1 -n 1 -r --num-slices=5 --slice-id=0 --backup-path=/var/lib/mysql-cluster/BACKUP/BACKUP-1
     $> ndb_restore -b 1 -n 1 -r --num-slices=5 --slice-id=1 --backup-path=/var/lib/mysql-cluster/BACKUP/BACKUP-1
     $> ndb_restore -b 1 -n 1 -r --num-slices=5 --slice-id=2 --backup-path=/var/lib/mysql-cluster/BACKUP/BACKUP-1
     $> ndb_restore -b 1 -n 1 -r --num-slices=5 --slice-id=3 --backup-path=/var/lib/mysql-cluster/BACKUP/BACKUP-1
     $> ndb_restore -b 1 -n 1 -r --num-slices=5 --slice-id=4 --backup-path=/var/lib/mysql-cluster/BACKUP/BACKUP-1

     $> ndb_restore -b 1 -n 2 -r --num-slices=5 --slice-id=0 --backup-path=/var/lib/mysql-cluster/BACKUP/BACKUP-1
     $> ndb_restore -b 1 -n 2 -r --num-slices=5 --slice-id=1 --backup-path=/var/lib/mysql-cluster/BACKUP/BACKUP-1
     $> ndb_restore -b 1 -n 2 -r --num-slices=5 --slice-id=2 --backup-path=/var/lib/mysql-cluster/BACKUP/BACKUP-1
     $> ndb_restore -b 1 -n 2 -r --num-slices=5 --slice-id=3 --backup-path=/var/lib/mysql-cluster/BACKUP/BACKUP-1
     $> ndb_restore -b 1 -n 2 -r --num-slices=5 --slice-id=4 --backup-path=/var/lib/mysql-cluster/BACKUP/BACKUP-1

     $> ndb_restore -b 1 -n 3 -r --num-slices=5 --slice-id=0 --backup-path=/var/lib/mysql-cluster/BACKUP/BACKUP-1
     $> ndb_restore -b 1 -n 3 -r --num-slices=5 --slice-id=1 --backup-path=/var/lib/mysql-cluster/BACKUP/BACKUP-1
     $> ndb_restore -b 1 -n 3 -r --num-slices=5 --slice-id=2 --backup-path=/var/lib/mysql-cluster/BACKUP/BACKUP-1
     $> ndb_restore -b 1 -n 3 -r --num-slices=5 --slice-id=3 --backup-path=/var/lib/mysql-cluster/BACKUP/BACKUP-1
     $> ndb_restore -b 1 -n 3 -r --num-slices=5 --slice-id=4 --backup-path=/var/lib/mysql-cluster/BACKUP/BACKUP-1

     $> ndb_restore -b 1 -n 4 -r --num-slices=5 --slice-id=0 --backup-path=/var/lib/mysql-cluster/BACKUP/BACKUP-1
     $> ndb_restore -b 1 -n 4 -r --num-slices=5 --slice-id=1 --backup-path=/var/lib/mysql-cluster/BACKUP/BACKUP-1
     $> ndb_restore -b 1 -n 4 -r --num-slices=5 --slice-id=2 --backup-path=/var/lib/mysql-cluster/BACKUP/BACKUP-1
     $> ndb_restore -b 1 -n 4 -r --num-slices=5 --slice-id=3 --backup-path=/var/lib/mysql-cluster/BACKUP/BACKUP-1
     $> ndb_restore -b 1 -n 4 -r --num-slices=5 --slice-id=4 --backup-path=/var/lib/mysql-cluster/BACKUP/BACKUP-1
     ```

     All of the commands just shown in this step can be
     executed in parallel, provided there are enough slots
     for connections to the cluster (see the description for
     the [`--backup-path`](mysql-cluster-programs-ndb-restore.md#option_ndb_restore_backup-path)
     option).
  3. Restore indexes as usual, as shown here:

     ```terminal
     $> ndb_restore -b 1 -n 1 --rebuild-indexes --backup-path=/var/lib/mysql-cluster/BACKUP/BACKUP-1
     ```
  4. Finally, restore the epoch, using the command shown
     here:

     ```terminal
     $> ndb_restore -b 1 -n 1 --restore-epoch --backup-path=/var/lib/mysql-cluster/BACKUP/BACKUP-1
     ```

  You should use slicing to restore the cluster data only; it
  is not necessary to employ
  [`--num-slices`](mysql-cluster-programs-ndb-restore.md#option_ndb_restore_num-slices) or
  [`--slice-id`](mysql-cluster-programs-ndb-restore.md#option_ndb_restore_slice-id) when
  restoring the metadata, indexes, or epoch information. If
  either or both of these options are used with the
  [**ndb\_restore**](mysql-cluster-programs-ndb-restore.md "25.5.23 ndb_restore — Restore an NDB Cluster Backup") options controlling
  restoration of these, the program ignores them.

  The effects of using the
  [`--parallelism`](mysql-cluster-programs-ndb-restore.md#option_ndb_restore_parallelism) option on
  the speed of restoration are independent of those produced
  by slicing or parallel restoration using multiple instances
  of [**ndb\_restore**](mysql-cluster-programs-ndb-restore.md "25.5.23 ndb_restore — Restore an NDB Cluster Backup")
  (`--parallelism` specifies the number of
  parallel transactions executed by a
  *single* [**ndb\_restore**](mysql-cluster-programs-ndb-restore.md "25.5.23 ndb_restore — Restore an NDB Cluster Backup")
  thread), but it can be used together with either or both of
  these. You should be aware that increasing
  `--parallelism` causes
  [**ndb\_restore**](mysql-cluster-programs-ndb-restore.md "25.5.23 ndb_restore — Restore an NDB Cluster Backup") to impose a greater load on
  the cluster; if the system can handle this, restoration
  should complete even more quickly.

  The value of `--num-slices` is not directly
  dependent on values relating to hardware such as number of
  CPUs or CPU cores, amount of RAM, and so forth, nor does it
  depend on the number of LDMs.

  It is possible to employ different values for this option on
  different data nodes as part of the same restoration; doing
  so should not in and of itself produce any ill effects.
- [`--parallelism`](mysql-cluster-programs-ndb-restore.md#option_ndb_restore_parallelism)=*`#`*,
  `-p`

  |  |  |
  | --- | --- |
  | Command-Line Format | `--parallelism=#` |
  | Type | Numeric |
  | Default Value | `128` |
  | Minimum Value | `1` |
  | Maximum Value | `1024` |

  [**ndb\_restore**](mysql-cluster-programs-ndb-restore.md "25.5.23 ndb_restore — Restore an NDB Cluster Backup") uses single-row transactions
  to apply many rows concurrently. This parameter determines
  the number of parallel transactions (concurrent rows) that
  an instance of [**ndb\_restore**](mysql-cluster-programs-ndb-restore.md "25.5.23 ndb_restore — Restore an NDB Cluster Backup") tries to use.
  By default, this is 128; the minimum is 1, and the maximum
  is 1024.

  The work of performing the inserts is parallelized across
  the threads in the data nodes involved. This mechanism is
  employed for restoring bulk data from the
  `.Data` file—that is, the fuzzy
  snapshot of the data; it is not used for building or
  rebuilding indexes. The change log is applied serially;
  index drops and builds are DDL operations and handled
  separately. There is no thread-level parallelism on the
  client side of the restore.
- [`--preserve-trailing-spaces`](mysql-cluster-programs-ndb-restore.md#option_ndb_restore_preserve-trailing-spaces),
  `-P`

  |  |  |
  | --- | --- |
  | Command-Line Format | `--preserve-trailing-spaces` |

  Cause trailing spaces to be preserved when promoting a
  fixed-width character data type to its variable-width
  equivalent—that is, when promoting a
  [`CHAR`](char.md "13.3.2 The CHAR and VARCHAR Types") column value to
  [`VARCHAR`](char.md "13.3.2 The CHAR and VARCHAR Types"), or a
  `BINARY` column value to
  [`VARBINARY`](binary-varbinary.md "13.3.3 The BINARY and VARBINARY Types"). Otherwise, any
  trailing spaces are dropped from such column values when
  they are inserted into the new columns.

  Note

  Although you can promote
  [`CHAR`](char.md "13.3.2 The CHAR and VARCHAR Types") columns to
  [`VARCHAR`](char.md "13.3.2 The CHAR and VARCHAR Types") and
  `BINARY` columns to
  [`VARBINARY`](binary-varbinary.md "13.3.3 The BINARY and VARBINARY Types"), you cannot
  promote [`VARCHAR`](char.md "13.3.2 The CHAR and VARCHAR Types") columns to
  [`CHAR`](char.md "13.3.2 The CHAR and VARCHAR Types") or
  [`VARBINARY`](binary-varbinary.md "13.3.3 The BINARY and VARBINARY Types") columns to
  `BINARY`.
- [`--print`](mysql-cluster-programs-ndb-restore.md#option_ndb_restore_print)

  |  |  |
  | --- | --- |
  | Command-Line Format | `--print` |

  Causes [**ndb\_restore**](mysql-cluster-programs-ndb-restore.md "25.5.23 ndb_restore — Restore an NDB Cluster Backup") to print all data,
  metadata, and logs to `stdout`. Equivalent
  to using the
  [`--print-data`](mysql-cluster-programs-ndb-restore.md#option_ndb_restore_print-data),
  [`--print-meta`](mysql-cluster-programs-ndb-restore.md#option_ndb_restore_print-meta), and
  [`--print-log`](mysql-cluster-programs-ndb-restore.md#option_ndb_restore_print-log) options
  together.

  Note

  Use of `--print` or any of the
  `--print_*` options is in effect performing
  a dry run. Including one or more of these options causes
  any output to be redirected to `stdout`;
  in such cases, [**ndb\_restore**](mysql-cluster-programs-ndb-restore.md "25.5.23 ndb_restore — Restore an NDB Cluster Backup") makes no
  attempt to restore data or metadata to an NDB Cluster.
- [`--print-data`](mysql-cluster-programs-ndb-restore.md#option_ndb_restore_print-data)

  |  |  |
  | --- | --- |
  | Command-Line Format | `--print-data` |

  Cause [**ndb\_restore**](mysql-cluster-programs-ndb-restore.md "25.5.23 ndb_restore — Restore an NDB Cluster Backup") to direct its output to
  `stdout`. Often used together with one or
  more of [`--tab`](mysql-cluster-programs-ndb-restore.md#option_ndb_restore_tab),
  [`--fields-enclosed-by`](mysql-cluster-programs-ndb-restore.md#option_ndb_restore_fields-enclosed-by),
  [`--fields-optionally-enclosed-by`](mysql-cluster-programs-ndb-restore.md#option_ndb_restore_fields-optionally-enclosed-by),
  [`--fields-terminated-by`](mysql-cluster-programs-ndb-restore.md#option_ndb_restore_fields-terminated-by),
  [`--hex`](mysql-cluster-programs-ndb-restore.md#option_ndb_restore_hex), and
  [`--append`](mysql-cluster-programs-ndb-restore.md#option_ndb_restore_append).

  [`TEXT`](blob.md "13.3.4 The BLOB and TEXT Types") and
  [`BLOB`](blob.md "13.3.4 The BLOB and TEXT Types") column values are always
  truncated. Such values are truncated to the first 256 bytes
  in the output. This cannot currently be overridden when
  using `--print-data`.
- [`--print-defaults`](mysql-cluster-programs-ndb-restore.md#option_ndb_restore_print-defaults)

  |  |  |
  | --- | --- |
  | Command-Line Format | `--print-defaults` |

  Print program argument list and exit.
- [`--print-log`](mysql-cluster-programs-ndb-restore.md#option_ndb_restore_print-log)

  |  |  |
  | --- | --- |
  | Command-Line Format | `--print-log` |

  Cause [**ndb\_restore**](mysql-cluster-programs-ndb-restore.md "25.5.23 ndb_restore — Restore an NDB Cluster Backup") to output its log to
  `stdout`.
- [`--print-meta`](mysql-cluster-programs-ndb-restore.md#option_ndb_restore_print-meta)

  |  |  |
  | --- | --- |
  | Command-Line Format | `--print-meta` |

  Print all metadata to `stdout`.
- [`print-sql-log`](mysql-cluster-programs-ndb-restore.md#option_ndb_restore_print-sql-log)

  |  |  |
  | --- | --- |
  | Command-Line Format | `--print-sql-log` |

  Log SQL statements to `stdout`. Use the
  option to enable; normally this behavior is disabled. The
  option checks before attempting to log whether all the
  tables being restored have explicitly defined primary keys;
  queries on a table having only the hidden primary key
  implemented by `NDB` cannot be converted to
  valid SQL.

  This option does not work with tables having
  [`BLOB`](blob.md "13.3.4 The BLOB and TEXT Types") columns.
- [`--progress-frequency`](mysql-cluster-programs-ndb-restore.md#option_ndb_restore_progress-frequency)=*`N`*

  |  |  |
  | --- | --- |
  | Command-Line Format | `--progress-frequency=#` |
  | Type | Numeric |
  | Default Value | `0` |
  | Minimum Value | `0` |
  | Maximum Value | `65535` |

  Print a status report each *`N`*
  seconds while the backup is in progress. 0 (the default)
  causes no status reports to be printed. The maximum is
  65535.
- [`--promote-attributes`](mysql-cluster-programs-ndb-restore.md#option_ndb_restore_promote-attributes),
  `-A`

  |  |  |
  | --- | --- |
  | Command-Line Format | `--promote-attributes` |

  [**ndb\_restore**](mysql-cluster-programs-ndb-restore.md "25.5.23 ndb_restore — Restore an NDB Cluster Backup") supports limited
  attribute promotion in
  much the same way that it is supported by MySQL replication;
  that is, data backed up from a column of a given type can
  generally be restored to a column using a “larger,
  similar” type. For example, data from a
  `CHAR(20)` column can be restored to a
  column declared as `VARCHAR(20)`,
  `VARCHAR(30)`, or
  `CHAR(30)`; data from a
  [`MEDIUMINT`](integer-types.md "13.1.2 Integer Types (Exact Value) - INTEGER, INT, SMALLINT, TINYINT, MEDIUMINT, BIGINT") column can be
  restored to a column of type
  [`INT`](integer-types.md "13.1.2 Integer Types (Exact Value) - INTEGER, INT, SMALLINT, TINYINT, MEDIUMINT, BIGINT") or
  [`BIGINT`](integer-types.md "13.1.2 Integer Types (Exact Value) - INTEGER, INT, SMALLINT, TINYINT, MEDIUMINT, BIGINT"). See
  [Section 19.5.1.9.2, “Replication of Columns Having Different Data Types”](replication-features-differing-tables.md#replication-features-different-data-types "19.5.1.9.2 Replication of Columns Having Different Data Types"),
  for a table of type conversions currently supported by
  attribute promotion.

  Beginning with NDB 8.0.26, this option also makes it
  possible to restore a `NOT NULL` column as
  `NULL`.

  Attribute promotion by [**ndb\_restore**](mysql-cluster-programs-ndb-restore.md "25.5.23 ndb_restore — Restore an NDB Cluster Backup") must
  be enabled explicitly, as follows:

  1. Prepare the table to which the backup is to be restored.
     [**ndb\_restore**](mysql-cluster-programs-ndb-restore.md "25.5.23 ndb_restore — Restore an NDB Cluster Backup") cannot be used to
     re-create the table with a different definition from the
     original; this means that you must either create the
     table manually, or alter the columns which you wish to
     promote using [`ALTER TABLE`](alter-table.md "15.1.9 ALTER TABLE Statement")
     after restoring the table metadata but before restoring
     the data.
  2. Invoke [**ndb\_restore**](mysql-cluster-programs-ndb-restore.md "25.5.23 ndb_restore — Restore an NDB Cluster Backup") with the
     [`--promote-attributes`](mysql-cluster-programs-ndb-restore.md#option_ndb_restore_promote-attributes)
     option (short form `-A`) when restoring
     the table data. Attribute promotion does not occur if
     this option is not used; instead, the restore operation
     fails with an error.

  When converting between character data types and
  `TEXT` or `BLOB`, only
  conversions between character types
  ([`CHAR`](char.md "13.3.2 The CHAR and VARCHAR Types") and
  [`VARCHAR`](char.md "13.3.2 The CHAR and VARCHAR Types")) and binary types
  ([`BINARY`](binary-varbinary.md "13.3.3 The BINARY and VARBINARY Types") and
  [`VARBINARY`](binary-varbinary.md "13.3.3 The BINARY and VARBINARY Types")) can be performed
  at the same time. For example, you cannot promote an
  [`INT`](integer-types.md "13.1.2 Integer Types (Exact Value) - INTEGER, INT, SMALLINT, TINYINT, MEDIUMINT, BIGINT") column to
  [`BIGINT`](integer-types.md "13.1.2 Integer Types (Exact Value) - INTEGER, INT, SMALLINT, TINYINT, MEDIUMINT, BIGINT") while promoting a
  `VARCHAR` column to `TEXT`
  in the same invocation of [**ndb\_restore**](mysql-cluster-programs-ndb-restore.md "25.5.23 ndb_restore — Restore an NDB Cluster Backup").

  Converting between [`TEXT`](blob.md "13.3.4 The BLOB and TEXT Types")
  columns using different character sets is not supported, and
  is expressly disallowed.

  When performing conversions of character or binary types to
  `TEXT` or `BLOB` with
  [**ndb\_restore**](mysql-cluster-programs-ndb-restore.md "25.5.23 ndb_restore — Restore an NDB Cluster Backup"), you may notice that it
  creates and uses one or more staging tables named
  `table_name$STnode_id`.
  These tables are not needed afterwards, and are normally
  deleted by [**ndb\_restore**](mysql-cluster-programs-ndb-restore.md "25.5.23 ndb_restore — Restore an NDB Cluster Backup") following a
  successful restoration.
- [`--rebuild-indexes`](mysql-cluster-programs-ndb-restore.md#option_ndb_restore_rebuild-indexes)

  |  |  |
  | --- | --- |
  | Command-Line Format | `--rebuild-indexes` |

  Enable multithreaded rebuilding of the ordered indexes while
  restoring a native `NDB` backup. The number
  of threads used for building ordered indexes by
  [**ndb\_restore**](mysql-cluster-programs-ndb-restore.md "25.5.23 ndb_restore — Restore an NDB Cluster Backup") with this option is
  controlled by the
  [`BuildIndexThreads`](mysql-cluster-ndbd-definition.md#ndbparam-ndbd-buildindexthreads)
  data node configuration parameter and the number of LDMs.

  It is necessary to use this option only for the first run of
  [**ndb\_restore**](mysql-cluster-programs-ndb-restore.md "25.5.23 ndb_restore — Restore an NDB Cluster Backup"); this causes all ordered
  indexes to be rebuilt without using
  `--rebuild-indexes` again when restoring
  subsequent nodes. You should use this option prior to
  inserting new rows into the database; otherwise, it is
  possible for a row to be inserted that later causes a unique
  constraint violation when trying to rebuild the indexes.

  Building of ordered indices is parallelized with the number
  of LDMs by default. Offline index builds performed during
  node and system restarts can be made faster using the
  [`BuildIndexThreads`](mysql-cluster-ndbd-definition.md#ndbparam-ndbd-buildindexthreads)
  data node configuration parameter; this parameter has no
  effect on dropping and rebuilding of indexes by
  [**ndb\_restore**](mysql-cluster-programs-ndb-restore.md "25.5.23 ndb_restore — Restore an NDB Cluster Backup"), which is performed online.

  Rebuilding of unique indexes uses disk write bandwidth for
  redo logging and local checkpointing. An insufficient amount
  of this bandwidth can lead to redo buffer overload or log
  overload errors. In such cases you can run
  [**ndb\_restore**](mysql-cluster-programs-ndb-restore.md "25.5.23 ndb_restore — Restore an NDB Cluster Backup")
  `--rebuild-indexes` again; the process
  resumes at the point where the error occurred. You can also
  do this when you have encountered temporary errors. You can
  repeat execution of [**ndb\_restore**](mysql-cluster-programs-ndb-restore.md "25.5.23 ndb_restore — Restore an NDB Cluster Backup")
  `--rebuild-indexes` indefinitely; you may be
  able to stop such errors by reducing the value of
  [`--parallelism`](mysql-cluster-programs-ndb-restore.md#option_ndb_restore_parallelism). If the
  problem is insufficient space, you can increase the size of
  the redo log
  ([`FragmentLogFileSize`](mysql-cluster-ndbd-definition.md#ndbparam-ndbd-fragmentlogfilesize)
  node configuration parameter), or you can increase the speed
  at which LCPs are performed
  ([`MaxDiskWriteSpeed`](mysql-cluster-ndbd-definition.md#ndbparam-ndbd-maxdiskwritespeed)
  and related parameters), in order to free space more
  quickly.
- [`--remap-column=db.tbl.col:fn:args`](mysql-cluster-programs-ndb-restore.md#option_ndb_restore_remap-column)

  |  |  |
  | --- | --- |
  | Command-Line Format | `--remap-column=string` |
  | Introduced | 8.0.21-ndb-8.0.21 |
  | Type | String |
  | Default Value | `[none]` |

  When used together with
  [`--restore-data`](mysql-cluster-programs-ndb-restore.md#option_ndb_restore_restore-data), this
  option applies a function to the value of the indicated
  column. Values in the argument string are listed here:

  - *`db`*: Database name, following
    any renames performed by
    [`--rewrite-database`](mysql-cluster-programs-ndb-restore.md#option_ndb_restore_rewrite-database).
  - *`tbl`*: Table name.
  - *`col`*: Name of the column to be
    updated. This column must be of type
    [`INT`](integer-types.md "13.1.2 Integer Types (Exact Value) - INTEGER, INT, SMALLINT, TINYINT, MEDIUMINT, BIGINT") or
    [`BIGINT`](integer-types.md "13.1.2 Integer Types (Exact Value) - INTEGER, INT, SMALLINT, TINYINT, MEDIUMINT, BIGINT"). The column can
    also be but is not required to be
    `UNSIGNED`.
  - *`fn`*: Function name; currently,
    the only supported name is `offset`.
  - *`args`*: Arguments supplied to
    the function. Currently, only a single argument, the
    size of the offset to be added by the
    `offset` function, is supported.
    Negative values are supported. The size of the argument
    cannot exceed that of the signed variant of the
    column's type; for example, if
    *`col`* is an
    `INT` column, then the allowed range of
    the argument passed to the `offset`
    function is `-2147483648` to
    `2147483647` (see
    [Section 13.1.2, “Integer Types (Exact Value) - INTEGER, INT, SMALLINT, TINYINT,
    MEDIUMINT, BIGINT”](integer-types.md "13.1.2 Integer Types (Exact Value) - INTEGER, INT, SMALLINT, TINYINT, MEDIUMINT, BIGINT")).

    If applying the offset value to the column would cause
    an overflow or underflow, the restore operation fails.
    This could happen, for example, if the column is a
    `BIGINT`, and the option attempts to
    apply an offset value of 8 on a row in which the column
    value is 4294967291, since `4294967291 + 8
    = 4294967299 > 4294967295`.

  This option can be useful when you wish to merge data stored
  in multiple source instances of NDB Cluster (all using the
  same schema) into a single destination NDB Cluster, using
  NDB native backup (see
  [Section 25.6.8.2, “Using The NDB Cluster Management Client to Create a Backup”](mysql-cluster-backup-using-management-client.md "25.6.8.2 Using The NDB Cluster Management Client to Create a Backup"))
  and [**ndb\_restore**](mysql-cluster-programs-ndb-restore.md "25.5.23 ndb_restore — Restore an NDB Cluster Backup") to merge the data, where
  primary and unique key values are overlapping between source
  clusters, and it is necessary as part of the process to
  remap these values to ranges that do not overlap. It may
  also be necessary to preserve other relationships between
  tables. To fulfill such requirements, it is possible to use
  the option multiple times in the same invocation of
  [**ndb\_restore**](mysql-cluster-programs-ndb-restore.md "25.5.23 ndb_restore — Restore an NDB Cluster Backup") to remap columns of different
  tables, as shown here:

  ```terminal
  $> ndb_restore --restore-data --remap-column=hr.employee.id:offset:1000 \
      --remap-column=hr.manager.id:offset:1000 --remap-column=hr.firstaiders.id:offset:1000
  ```

  (Other options not shown here may also be used.)

  `--remap-column` can also be used to update
  multiple columns of the same table. Combinations of multiple
  tables and columns are possible. Different offset values can
  also be used for different columns of the same table, like
  this:

  ```terminal
  $> ndb_restore --restore-data --remap-column=hr.employee.salary:offset:10000 \
      --remap-column=hr.employee.hours:offset:-10
  ```

  When source backups contain duplicate tables which should
  not be merged, you can handle this by using
  [`--exclude-tables`](mysql-cluster-programs-ndb-restore.md#option_ndb_restore_exclude-tables),
  [`--exclude-databases`](mysql-cluster-programs-ndb-restore.md#option_ndb_restore_exclude-databases), or
  by some other means in your application.

  Information about the structure and other characteristics of
  tables to be merged can obtained using
  [`SHOW CREATE TABLE`](show-create-table.md "15.7.7.10 SHOW CREATE TABLE Statement"); the
  [**ndb\_desc**](mysql-cluster-programs-ndb-desc.md "25.5.9 ndb_desc — Describe NDB Tables") tool; and
  [`MAX()`](aggregate-functions.md#function_max),
  [`MIN()`](aggregate-functions.md#function_min),
  [`LAST_INSERT_ID()`](information-functions.md#function_last-insert-id), and other
  MySQL functions.

  Replication of changes from merged to unmerged tables, or
  from unmerged to merged tables, in separate instances of NDB
  Cluster is not supported.
- [`--restore-data`](mysql-cluster-programs-ndb-restore.md#option_ndb_restore_restore-data),
  `-r`

  |  |  |
  | --- | --- |
  | Command-Line Format | `--restore-data` |

  Output [`NDB`](mysql-cluster.md "Chapter 25 MySQL NDB Cluster 8.0") table data and logs.
- [`--restore-epoch`](mysql-cluster-programs-ndb-restore.md#option_ndb_restore_restore-epoch),
  `-e`

  |  |  |
  | --- | --- |
  | Command-Line Format | `--restore-epoch` |

  Add (or restore) epoch information to the cluster
  replication status table. This is useful for starting
  replication on an NDB Cluster replica. When this option is
  used, the row in the
  `mysql.ndb_apply_status` having
  `0` in the `id` column is
  updated if it already exists; such a row is inserted if it
  does not already exist. (See
  [Section 25.7.9, “NDB Cluster Backups With NDB Cluster Replication”](mysql-cluster-replication-backups.md "25.7.9 NDB Cluster Backups With NDB Cluster Replication").)
- [`--restore-meta`](mysql-cluster-programs-ndb-restore.md#option_ndb_restore_restore-meta),
  `-m`

  |  |  |
  | --- | --- |
  | Command-Line Format | `--restore-meta` |

  This option causes [**ndb\_restore**](mysql-cluster-programs-ndb-restore.md "25.5.23 ndb_restore — Restore an NDB Cluster Backup") to print
  [`NDB`](mysql-cluster.md "Chapter 25 MySQL NDB Cluster 8.0") table metadata.

  The first time you run the [**ndb\_restore**](mysql-cluster-programs-ndb-restore.md "25.5.23 ndb_restore — Restore an NDB Cluster Backup")
  restoration program, you also need to restore the metadata.
  In other words, you must re-create the database
  tables—this can be done by running it with the
  `--restore-meta` (`-m`)
  option. Restoring the metadata need be done only on a single
  data node; this is sufficient to restore it to the entire
  cluster.

  In older versions of NDB Cluster, tables whose schemas were
  restored using this option used the same number of
  partitions as they did on the original cluster, even if it
  had a differing number of data nodes from the new cluster.
  In NDB 8.0, when restoring metadata, this is no longer an
  issue; [**ndb\_restore**](mysql-cluster-programs-ndb-restore.md "25.5.23 ndb_restore — Restore an NDB Cluster Backup") now uses the default
  number of partitions for the target cluster, unless the
  number of local data manager threads is also changed from
  what it was for data nodes in the original cluster.

  When using this option in NDB 8.0, it is recommended that
  auto synchronization be disabled by setting
  [`ndb_metadata_check=OFF`](mysql-cluster-options-variables.md#sysvar_ndb_metadata_check)
  until [**ndb\_restore**](mysql-cluster-programs-ndb-restore.md "25.5.23 ndb_restore — Restore an NDB Cluster Backup") has completed restoring
  the metadata, after which it can it turned on again to
  synchronize objects newly created in the NDB dictionary.

  Note

  The cluster should have an empty database when starting to
  restore a backup. (In other words, you should start the
  data nodes with [`--initial`](mysql-cluster-programs-ndbd.md#option_ndbd_initial)
  prior to performing the restore.)
- [`--restore-privilege-tables`](mysql-cluster-programs-ndb-restore.md#option_ndb_restore_restore-privilege-tables)

  |  |  |
  | --- | --- |
  | Command-Line Format | `--restore-privilege-tables` |
  | Deprecated | 8.0.16-ndb-8.0.16 |

  [**ndb\_restore**](mysql-cluster-programs-ndb-restore.md "25.5.23 ndb_restore — Restore an NDB Cluster Backup") does not by default restore
  distributed MySQL privilege tables created in releases of
  NDB Cluster prior to version 8.0, which does not support
  distributed privileges as implemented in NDB 7.6 and
  earlier. This option causes [**ndb\_restore**](mysql-cluster-programs-ndb-restore.md "25.5.23 ndb_restore — Restore an NDB Cluster Backup")
  to restore them.

  In NDB 8.0, such tables are not used for access control; as
  part of the MySQL server's upgrade process, the server
  creates [`InnoDB`](innodb-storage-engine.md "Chapter 17 The InnoDB Storage Engine") copies of these
  tables local to itself. For more information, see
  [Section 25.3.7, “Upgrading and Downgrading NDB Cluster”](mysql-cluster-upgrade-downgrade.md "25.3.7 Upgrading and Downgrading NDB Cluster"), as well
  as [Section 8.2.3, “Grant Tables”](grant-tables.md "8.2.3 Grant Tables").
- [`--rewrite-database`](mysql-cluster-programs-ndb-restore.md#option_ndb_restore_rewrite-database)=*`olddb,newdb`*

  |  |  |
  | --- | --- |
  | Command-Line Format | `--rewrite-database=string` |
  | Type | String |
  | Default Value | `none` |

  This option makes it possible to restore to a database
  having a different name from that used in the backup. For
  example, if a backup is made of a database named
  `products`, you can restore the data it
  contains to a database named `inventory`,
  use this option as shown here (omitting any other options
  that might be required):

  ```terminal
  $> ndb_restore --rewrite-database=product,inventory
  ```

  The option can be employed multiple times in a single
  invocation of [**ndb\_restore**](mysql-cluster-programs-ndb-restore.md "25.5.23 ndb_restore — Restore an NDB Cluster Backup"). Thus it is
  possible to restore simultaneously from a database named
  `db1` to a database named
  `db2` and from a database named
  `db3` to one named `db4`
  using `--rewrite-database=db1,db2
  --rewrite-database=db3,db4`. Other
  [**ndb\_restore**](mysql-cluster-programs-ndb-restore.md "25.5.23 ndb_restore — Restore an NDB Cluster Backup") options may be used between
  multiple occurrences of `--rewrite-database`.

  In the event of conflicts between multiple
  `--rewrite-database` options, the last
  `--rewrite-database` option used, reading
  from left to right, is the one that takes effect. For
  example, if `--rewrite-database=db1,db2
  --rewrite-database=db1,db3` is used, only
  `--rewrite-database=db1,db3` is honored, and
  `--rewrite-database=db1,db2` is ignored. It
  is also possible to restore from multiple databases to a
  single database, so that `--rewrite-database=db1,db3
  --rewrite-database=db2,db3` restores all tables and
  data from databases `db1` and
  `db2` into database `db3`.

  Important

  When restoring from multiple backup databases into a
  single target database using
  `--rewrite-database`, no check is made for
  collisions between table or other object names, and the
  order in which rows are restored is not guaranteed. This
  means that it is possible in such cases for rows to be
  overwritten and updates to be lost.
- [`--skip-broken-objects`](mysql-cluster-programs-ndb-restore.md#option_ndb_restore_skip-broken-objects)

  |  |  |
  | --- | --- |
  | Command-Line Format | `--skip-broken-objects` |

  This option causes [**ndb\_restore**](mysql-cluster-programs-ndb-restore.md "25.5.23 ndb_restore — Restore an NDB Cluster Backup") to ignore
  corrupt tables while reading a native
  [`NDB`](mysql-cluster.md "Chapter 25 MySQL NDB Cluster 8.0") backup, and to continue
  restoring any remaining tables (that are not also
  corrupted). Currently, the
  `--skip-broken-objects` option works only in
  the case of missing blob parts tables.
- [`--skip-fk-checks`](mysql-cluster-programs-ndb-restore.md#option_ndb_restore_skip-fk-checks)

  |  |  |
  | --- | --- |
  | Command-Line Format | `--skip-fk-checks` |
  | Introduced | 8.0.45-ndb-8.0.45 |

  This option modifies the behavior of
  [**ndb\_restore**](mysql-cluster-programs-ndb-restore.md "25.5.23 ndb_restore — Restore an NDB Cluster Backup")
  [`--rebuild-indexes`](mysql-cluster-programs-ndb-restore.md#option_ndb_restore_rebuild-indexes) so
  that, when foreign keys are re-enabled, the existing data in
  the table is not checked for consistency.
- [`--skip-table-check`](mysql-cluster-programs-ndb-restore.md#option_ndb_restore_skip-table-check),
  `-s`

  |  |  |
  | --- | --- |
  | Command-Line Format | `--skip-table-check` |

  It is possible to restore data without restoring table
  metadata. By default when doing this,
  [**ndb\_restore**](mysql-cluster-programs-ndb-restore.md "25.5.23 ndb_restore — Restore an NDB Cluster Backup") fails with an error if a
  mismatch is found between the table data and the table
  schema; this option overrides that behavior.

  Some of the restrictions on mismatches in column definitions
  when restoring data using [**ndb\_restore**](mysql-cluster-programs-ndb-restore.md "25.5.23 ndb_restore — Restore an NDB Cluster Backup") are
  relaxed; when one of these types of mismatches is
  encountered, [**ndb\_restore**](mysql-cluster-programs-ndb-restore.md "25.5.23 ndb_restore — Restore an NDB Cluster Backup") does not stop
  with an error as it did previously, but rather accepts the
  data and inserts it into the target table while issuing a
  warning to the user that this is being done. This behavior
  occurs whether or not either of the options
  `--skip-table-check` or
  [`--promote-attributes`](mysql-cluster-programs-ndb-restore.md#option_ndb_restore_promote-attributes) is
  in use. These differences in column definitions are of the
  following types:

  - Different `COLUMN_FORMAT` settings
    (`FIXED`, `DYNAMIC`,
    `DEFAULT`)
  - Different `STORAGE` settings
    (`MEMORY`, `DISK`)
  - Different default values
  - Different distribution key settings
- [`--skip-unknown-objects`](mysql-cluster-programs-ndb-restore.md#option_ndb_restore_skip-unknown-objects)

  |  |  |
  | --- | --- |
  | Command-Line Format | `--skip-unknown-objects` |

  This option causes [**ndb\_restore**](mysql-cluster-programs-ndb-restore.md "25.5.23 ndb_restore — Restore an NDB Cluster Backup") to ignore
  any schema objects it does not recognize while reading a
  native [`NDB`](mysql-cluster.md "Chapter 25 MySQL NDB Cluster 8.0") backup. This can be
  used for restoring a backup made from a cluster running (for
  example) NDB 7.6 to a cluster running NDB Cluster 7.5.
- [`--slice-id`](mysql-cluster-programs-ndb-restore.md#option_ndb_restore_slice-id)=*`#`*

  |  |  |
  | --- | --- |
  | Command-Line Format | `--slice-id=#` |
  | Introduced | 8.0.20-ndb-8.0.20 |
  | Type | Integer |
  | Default Value | `0` |
  | Minimum Value | `0` |
  | Maximum Value | `1023` |

  When restoring by slices, this is the ID of the slice to
  restore. This option is always used together with
  [`--num-slices`](mysql-cluster-programs-ndb-restore.md#option_ndb_restore_num-slices), and its
  value must be always less than that of
  `--num-slices`.

  For more information, see the description of the
  [`--num-slices`](mysql-cluster-programs-ndb-restore.md#option_ndb_restore_num-slices) elsewhere

  | Command-Line Format | `--tab=path` |
  | Type | Directory name |

  Causes [`--print-data`](mysql-cluster-programs-ndb-restore.md#option_ndb_restore_print-data) to
  create dump files, one per table, each named
  `tbl_name.txt`.
  It requires as its argument the path to the directory where
  the files should be saved; use `.` for the
  current directory.
- `--timestamp-printouts`

  |  |  |
  | --- | --- |
  | Command-Line Format | `--timestamp-printouts{=true|false}` |
  | Introduced | 8.0.33-ndb-8.0.33 |
  | Type | Boolean |
  | Default Value | `true` |

  Causes info, error, and debug log messages to be prefixed
  with timestamps.

  This option is enabled by default in NDB 8.0. Disable it
  with `--timestamp-printouts=false`.
- [`--usage`](mysql-cluster-programs-ndb-restore.md#option_ndb_restore_usage)

  |  |  |

  | Command-Line Format | `--verbose=#` |
  | Type | Numeric |
  | Default Value | `1` |
  | Minimum Value | `0` |
  | Maximum Value | `255` |

  Sets the level for the verbosity of the output. The minimum
  is 0; the maximum is 255. The default value is 1.
- [`--version`](mysql-cluster-programs-ndb-restore.md#option_ndb_restore_version)

  |  |  |
  | --- | --- |
  | Command-Line Format | `--version` |

  Display version information and exit.
- [`--with-apply-status`](mysql-cluster-programs-ndb-restore.md#option_ndb_restore_with-apply-status)

  |  |  |
  | --- | --- |
  | Command-Line Format | `--with-apply-status` |
  | Introduced | 8.0.29-ndb-8.0.29 |

  Restore all rows from the backup's
  `ndb_apply_status` table (except for the
  row having `server_id = 0`, which is
  generated using
  [`--restore-epoch`](mysql-cluster-programs-ndb-restore.md#option_ndb_restore_restore-epoch)). This
  option requires that
  [`--restore-data`](mysql-cluster-programs-ndb-restore.md#option_ndb_restore_restore-data) also be
  used.

  If the `ndb_apply_status` table from the
  backup already contains a row with `server_id =
  0`, [**ndb\_restore**](mysql-cluster-programs-ndb-restore.md "25.5.23 ndb_restore — Restore an NDB Cluster Backup")
  `--with-apply-status` deletes it. For this
  reason, we recommend that you use
  [**ndb\_restore**](mysql-cluster-programs-ndb-restore.md "25.5.23 ndb_restore — Restore an NDB Cluster Backup")
  `--restore-epoch` after invoking
  [**ndb\_restore**](mysql-cluster-programs-ndb-restore.md "25.5.23 ndb_restore — Restore an NDB Cluster Backup") with the
  `--with-apply-status` option. You can also
  use `--restore-epoch` concurrently with the
  last of any invocations of [**ndb\_restore**](mysql-cluster-programs-ndb-restore.md "25.5.23 ndb_restore — Restore an NDB Cluster Backup")
  `--with-apply-status` used to restore the
  cluster.

  For more information, see
  [ndb\_apply\_status Table](mysql-cluster-replication-schema.md#ndb-replication-ndb-apply-status "ndb_apply_status Table").

Typical options for this utility are shown here:

```terminal
ndb_restore [-c connection_string] -n node_id -b backup_id \
      [-m] -r --backup-path=/path/to/backup/files
```

Normally, when restoring from an NDB Cluster backup,
[**ndb\_restore**](mysql-cluster-programs-ndb-restore.md "25.5.23 ndb_restore — Restore an NDB Cluster Backup") requires at a minimum the
[`--nodeid`](mysql-cluster-programs-ndb-restore.md#option_ndb_restore_nodeid) (short form:
`-n`),
[`--backupid`](mysql-cluster-programs-ndb-restore.md#option_ndb_restore_backupid) (short form:
`-b`), and
[`--backup-path`](mysql-cluster-programs-ndb-restore.md#option_ndb_restore_backup-path) options.

The `-c` option is used to specify a connection
string which tells `ndb_restore` where to
locate the cluster management server (see
[Section 25.4.3.3, “NDB Cluster Connection Strings”](mysql-cluster-connection-strings.md "25.4.3.3 NDB Cluster Connection Strings")). If this
option is not used, then [**ndb\_restore**](mysql-cluster-programs-ndb-restore.md "25.5.23 ndb_restore — Restore an NDB Cluster Backup") attempts
to connect to a management server on
`localhost:1186`. This utility acts as a
cluster API node, and so requires a free connection
“slot” to connect to the cluster management server.
This means that there must be at least one
`[api]` or `[mysqld]` section
that can be used by it in the cluster
`config.ini` file. It is a good idea to keep
at least one empty `[api]` or
`[mysqld]` section in
`config.ini` that is not being used for a
MySQL server or other application for this reason (see
[Section 25.4.3.7, “Defining SQL and Other API Nodes in an NDB Cluster”](mysql-cluster-api-definition.md "25.4.3.7 Defining SQL and Other API Nodes in an NDB Cluster")).

In NDB 8.0.22 and later, [**ndb\_restore**](mysql-cluster-programs-ndb-restore.md "25.5.23 ndb_restore — Restore an NDB Cluster Backup") can
decrypt an encrypted backup using
[`--decrypt`](mysql-cluster-programs-ndb-restore.md#option_ndb_restore_decrypt) and
[`--backup-password`](mysql-cluster-programs-ndb-restore.md#option_ndb_restore_backup-password). Both
options must be specified to perform decryption. See the
documentation for the [`START
BACKUP`](mysql-cluster-backup-using-management-client.md "25.6.8.2 Using The NDB Cluster Management Client to Create a Backup") management client command for information on
creating encrypted backups.

You can verify that [**ndb\_restore**](mysql-cluster-programs-ndb-restore.md "25.5.23 ndb_restore — Restore an NDB Cluster Backup") is connected
to the cluster by using the
[`SHOW`](mysql-cluster-mgm-client-commands.md#ndbclient-show) command in the
[**ndb\_mgm**](mysql-cluster-programs-ndb-mgm.md "25.5.5 ndb_mgm — The NDB Cluster Management Client") management client. You can also
accomplish this from a system shell, as shown here:

```terminal
$> ndb_mgm -e "SHOW"
```

**Error reporting.**
[**ndb\_restore**](mysql-cluster-programs-ndb-restore.md "25.5.23 ndb_restore — Restore an NDB Cluster Backup") reports both temporary and
permanent errors. In the case of temporary errors, it may able
to recover from them, and reports `Restore successful,
but encountered temporary error, please look at
configuration` in such cases.

Important

After using [**ndb\_restore**](mysql-cluster-programs-ndb-restore.md "25.5.23 ndb_restore — Restore an NDB Cluster Backup") to initialize an
NDB Cluster for use in circular replication, binary logs on
the SQL node acting as the replica are not automatically
created, and you must cause them to be created manually. To
cause the binary logs to be created, issue a
[`SHOW TABLES`](show-tables.md "15.7.7.39 SHOW TABLES Statement") statement on that
SQL node before running [`START
SLAVE`](start-slave.md "15.4.2.7 START SLAVE Statement"). This is a known issue in NDB Cluster.
