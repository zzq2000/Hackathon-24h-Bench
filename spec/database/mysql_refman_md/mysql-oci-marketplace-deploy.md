## 34.2 Deploying MySQL EE on Oracle Cloud Infrastructure

To deploy MySQL EE on Oracle Cloud Infrastructure, do the
following:

1. Open the OCI Marketplace and select
   MySQL.

   The MySQL listing is displayed.
2. Click Launch Instance to begin the
   application launch process.

   The Create Compute Instance dialog is
   displayed.

   See
   [To
   create a Linux instance](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/Compute/Tasks/launchinginstance.htm) for information on how to
   complete the fields.

By default, the MySQL server listens on port 3306 and is
configured with a single user, root.

Important

When the deployment is complete, and the MySQL server is
started, you must connect to the compute instance and retrieve
the default root password which was written to the MySQL log
file.

See [Connecting with SSH](mysql-oci-marketplace-connecting.md#mysql-oci-marketplace-connecting-ssh "Connecting with SSH") for
more information.

The following MySQL software is installed:

- MySQL Server EE
- MySQL Enterprise Backup
- MySQL Shell
- MySQL Router

### MySQL Configuration

For security, the following are enabled:

- SELinux: for more information, see
  [Configuring
  and Using SELinux](https://docs.oracle.com/en/operating-systems/oracle-linux/7/admin/ol7-s1-syssec.html)
- `firewalld`: for more information, see
  [Controlling
  the firewalld Firewall Service](https://docs.oracle.com/en/operating-systems/oracle-linux/7/security/ol7-implement-sec.html#ol7-firewalld-cfg)

The following MySQL plugins are enabled:

- `thread_pool`
- `validate_password`

On startup, the following occurs:

- MySQL Server reads `/etc/my.cnf` and all
  files named
  `*.cnf` in
  `/etc/my.cnf.d/`.
- `/etc/my.cnf.d/perf-tuning.cnf` is
  created by `/usr/bin/mkcnf` based on the
  selected OCI shape.

  Note

  To disable this mechanism, remove
  `/etc/systemd/system/mysqld.service.d/perf-tuning.conf`.

  Performance tuning is configured for the following shapes:

  - VM.Standard2.1
  - VM.Standard2.2
  - VM.Standard2.4
  - VM.Standard2.8
  - VM.Standard2.16
  - VM.Standard2.24
  - VM.Standard.E2.1
  - VM.Standard.E2.2
  - VM.Standard.E2.4
  - VM.Standard.E2.8
  - VM.Standard.E3.Flex
  - VM.Standard.E4.Flex
  - BM.Standard2.52

  For all other shapes, the tuning for VM.Standard2.1 is used.
