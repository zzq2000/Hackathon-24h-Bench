### 12.9.1 The utf8mb4 Character Set (4-Byte UTF-8 Unicode Encoding)

The `utf8mb4` character set has these
characteristics:

- Supports BMP and supplementary characters.
- Requires a maximum of four bytes per multibyte character.

`utf8mb4` contrasts with the
`utf8mb3` character set, which supports only
BMP characters and uses a maximum of three bytes per character:

- For a BMP character, `utf8mb4` and
  `utf8mb3` have identical storage
  characteristics: same code values, same encoding, same
  length.
- For a supplementary character, `utf8mb4`
  requires four bytes to store it, whereas
  `utf8mb3` cannot store the character at
  all. When converting `utf8mb3` columns to
  `utf8mb4`, you need not worry about
  converting supplementary characters because there are none.

`utf8mb4` is a superset of
`utf8mb3`, so for an operation such as the
following concatenation, the result has character set
`utf8mb4` and the collation of
`utf8mb4_col`:

```sql
SELECT CONCAT(utf8mb3_col, utf8mb4_col);
```

Similarly, the following comparison in the
`WHERE` clause works according to the collation
of `utf8mb4_col`:

```sql
SELECT * FROM utf8mb3_tbl, utf8mb4_tbl
WHERE utf8mb3_tbl.utf8mb3_col = utf8mb4_tbl.utf8mb4_col;
```
