#### 29.12.5.1 The events\_stages\_current Table

The [`events_stages_current`](performance-schema-events-stages-current-table.md "29.12.5.1 The events_stages_current Table") table
contains current stage events. The table stores one row per
thread showing the current status of the thread's most recent
monitored stage event, so there is no system variable for
configuring the table size.

Of the tables that contain stage event rows,
[`events_stages_current`](performance-schema-events-stages-current-table.md "29.12.5.1 The events_stages_current Table") is the most
fundamental. Other tables that contain stage event rows are
logically derived from the current events. For example, the
[`events_stages_history`](performance-schema-events-stages-history-table.md "29.12.5.2 The events_stages_history Table") and
[`events_stages_history_long`](performance-schema-events-stages-history-long-table.md "29.12.5.3 The events_stages_history_long Table") tables
are collections of the most recent stage events that have
ended, up to a maximum number of rows per thread and globally
across all threads, respectively.

For more information about the relationship between the three
stage event tables, see
[Section 29.9, “Performance Schema Tables for Current and Historical Events”](performance-schema-event-tables.md "29.9 Performance Schema Tables for Current and Historical Events").

For information about configuring whether to collect stage
events, see [Section 29.12.5, “Performance Schema Stage Event Tables”](performance-schema-stage-tables.md "29.12.5 Performance Schema Stage Event Tables").

The [`events_stages_current`](performance-schema-events-stages-current-table.md "29.12.5.1 The events_stages_current Table") table
has these columns:

- `THREAD_ID`, `EVENT_ID`

  The thread associated with the event and the thread
  current event number when the event starts. The
  `THREAD_ID` and
  `EVENT_ID` values taken together uniquely
  identify the row. No two rows have the same pair of
  values.
- `END_EVENT_ID`

  This column is set to `NULL` when the
  event starts and updated to the thread current event
  number when the event ends.
- `EVENT_NAME`

  The name of the instrument that produced the event. This
  is a `NAME` value from the
  [`setup_instruments`](performance-schema-setup-instruments-table.md "29.12.2.3 The setup_instruments Table") table.
  Instrument names may have multiple parts and form a
  hierarchy, as discussed in
  [Section 29.6, “Performance Schema Instrument Naming Conventions”](performance-schema-instrument-naming.md "29.6 Performance Schema Instrument Naming Conventions").
- `SOURCE`

  The name of the source file containing the instrumented
  code that produced the event and the line number in the
  file at which the instrumentation occurs. This enables you
  to check the source to determine exactly what code is
  involved.
- `TIMER_START`,
  `TIMER_END`,
  `TIMER_WAIT`

  Timing information for the event. The unit for these
  values is picoseconds (trillionths of a second). The
  `TIMER_START` and
  `TIMER_END` values indicate when event
  timing started and ended. `TIMER_WAIT` is
  the event elapsed time (duration).

  If an event has not finished, `TIMER_END`
  is the current timer value and
  `TIMER_WAIT` is the time elapsed so far
  (`TIMER_END` −
  `TIMER_START`).

  If an event is produced from an instrument that has
  `TIMED = NO`, timing information is not
  collected, and `TIMER_START`,
  `TIMER_END`, and
  `TIMER_WAIT` are all
  `NULL`.

  For discussion of picoseconds as the unit for event times
  and factors that affect time values, see
  [Section 29.4.1, “Performance Schema Event Timing”](performance-schema-timing.md "29.4.1 Performance Schema Event Timing").
- `WORK_COMPLETED`,
  `WORK_ESTIMATED`

  These columns provide stage progress information, for
  instruments that have been implemented to produce such
  information. `WORK_COMPLETED` indicates
  how many work units have been completed for the stage, and
  `WORK_ESTIMATED` indicates how many work
  units are expected for the stage. For more information,
  see [Stage Event Progress Information](performance-schema-stage-tables.md#stage-event-progress "Stage Event Progress Information").
- `NESTING_EVENT_ID`

  The `EVENT_ID` value of the event within
  which this event is nested. The nesting event for a stage
  event is usually a statement event.
- `NESTING_EVENT_TYPE`

  The nesting event type. The value is
  `TRANSACTION`,
  `STATEMENT`, `STAGE`, or
  `WAIT`.

The [`events_stages_current`](performance-schema-events-stages-current-table.md "29.12.5.1 The events_stages_current Table") table
has these indexes:

- Primary key on (`THREAD_ID`,
  `EVENT_ID`)

[`TRUNCATE TABLE`](truncate-table.md "15.1.37 TRUNCATE TABLE Statement") is permitted for
the [`events_stages_current`](performance-schema-events-stages-current-table.md "29.12.5.1 The events_stages_current Table") table.
It removes the rows.
