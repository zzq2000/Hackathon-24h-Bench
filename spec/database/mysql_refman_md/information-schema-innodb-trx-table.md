### 28.4.28 The INFORMATION\_SCHEMA INNODB\_TRX Table

The [`INNODB_TRX`](information-schema-innodb-trx-table.md "28.4.28 The INFORMATION_SCHEMA INNODB_TRX Table") table provides
information about every transaction currently executing inside
`InnoDB`, including whether the transaction is
waiting for a lock, when the transaction started, and the SQL
statement the transaction is executing, if any.

For usage information, see
[Section 17.15.2.1, “Using InnoDB Transaction and Locking Information”](innodb-information-schema-examples.md "17.15.2.1 Using InnoDB Transaction and Locking Information").

The [`INNODB_TRX`](information-schema-innodb-trx-table.md "28.4.28 The INFORMATION_SCHEMA INNODB_TRX Table") table has these
columns:

- `TRX_ID`

  A unique transaction ID number, internal to
  `InnoDB`. These IDs are not created for
  transactions that are read only and nonlocking. For details,
  see [Section 10.5.3, “Optimizing InnoDB Read-Only Transactions”](innodb-performance-ro-txn.md "10.5.3 Optimizing InnoDB Read-Only Transactions").
- `TRX_WEIGHT`

  The weight of a transaction, reflecting (but not necessarily
  the exact count of) the number of rows altered and the number
  of rows locked by the transaction. To resolve a deadlock,
  `InnoDB` selects the transaction with the
  smallest weight as the “victim” to roll back.
  Transactions that have changed nontransactional tables are
  considered heavier than others, regardless of the number of
  altered and locked rows.
- `TRX_STATE`

  The transaction execution state. Permitted values are
  `RUNNING`, `LOCK WAIT`,
  `ROLLING BACK`, and
  `COMMITTING`.
- `TRX_STARTED`

  The transaction start time.
- `TRX_REQUESTED_LOCK_ID`

  The ID of the lock the transaction is currently waiting for,
  if `TRX_STATE` is `LOCK
  WAIT`; otherwise `NULL`. To obtain
  details about the lock, join this column with the
  `ENGINE_LOCK_ID` column of the Performance
  Schema [`data_locks`](performance-schema-data-locks-table.md "29.12.13.1 The data_locks Table") table.
- `TRX_WAIT_STARTED`

  The time when the transaction started waiting on the lock, if
  `TRX_STATE` is `LOCK WAIT`;
  otherwise `NULL`.
- `TRX_MYSQL_THREAD_ID`

  The MySQL thread ID. To obtain details about the thread, join
  this column with the `ID` column of the
  `INFORMATION_SCHEMA`
  [`PROCESSLIST`](information-schema-processlist-table.md "28.3.23 The INFORMATION_SCHEMA PROCESSLIST Table") table, but see
  [Section 17.15.2.3, “Persistence and Consistency of InnoDB Transaction and Locking
  Information”](innodb-information-schema-internal-data.md "17.15.2.3 Persistence and Consistency of InnoDB Transaction and Locking Information").
- `TRX_QUERY`

  The SQL statement that is being executed by the transaction.
- `TRX_OPERATION_STATE`

  The transaction's current operation, if any; otherwise
  `NULL`.
- `TRX_TABLES_IN_USE`

  The number of `InnoDB` tables used while
  processing the current SQL statement of this transaction.
- `TRX_TABLES_LOCKED`

  The number of `InnoDB` tables that the
  current SQL statement has row locks on. (Because these are row
  locks, not table locks, the tables can usually still be read
  from and written to by multiple transactions, despite some
  rows being locked.)
- `TRX_LOCK_STRUCTS`

  The number of locks reserved by the transaction.
- `TRX_LOCK_MEMORY_BYTES`

  The total size taken up by the lock structures of this
  transaction in memory.
- `TRX_ROWS_LOCKED`

  The approximate number or rows locked by this transaction. The
  value might include delete-marked rows that are physically
  present but not visible to the transaction.
- `TRX_ROWS_MODIFIED`

  The number of modified and inserted rows in this transaction.
- `TRX_CONCURRENCY_TICKETS`

  A value indicating how much work the current transaction can
  do before being swapped out, as specified by the
  [`innodb_concurrency_tickets`](innodb-parameters.md#sysvar_innodb_concurrency_tickets)
  system variable.
- `TRX_ISOLATION_LEVEL`

  The isolation level of the current transaction.
- `TRX_UNIQUE_CHECKS`

  Whether unique checks are turned on or off for the current
  transaction. For example, they might be turned off during a
  bulk data load.
- `TRX_FOREIGN_KEY_CHECKS`

  Whether foreign key checks are turned on or off for the
  current transaction. For example, they might be turned off
  during a bulk data load.
- `TRX_LAST_FOREIGN_KEY_ERROR`

  The detailed error message for the last foreign key error, if
  any; otherwise `NULL`.
- `TRX_ADAPTIVE_HASH_LATCHED`

  Whether the adaptive hash index is locked by the current
  transaction. When the adaptive hash index search system is
  partitioned, a single transaction does not lock the entire
  adaptive hash index. Adaptive hash index partitioning is
  controlled by
  [`innodb_adaptive_hash_index_parts`](innodb-parameters.md#sysvar_innodb_adaptive_hash_index_parts),
  which is set to 8 by default.
- `TRX_ADAPTIVE_HASH_TIMEOUT`

  Deprecated in MySQL 5.7.8. Always returns 0.

  Whether to relinquish the search latch immediately for the
  adaptive hash index, or reserve it across calls from MySQL.
  When there is no adaptive hash index contention, this value
  remains zero and statements reserve the latch until they
  finish. During times of contention, it counts down to zero,
  and statements release the latch immediately after each row
  lookup. When the adaptive hash index search system is
  partitioned (controlled by
  [`innodb_adaptive_hash_index_parts`](innodb-parameters.md#sysvar_innodb_adaptive_hash_index_parts)),
  the value remains 0.
- `TRX_IS_READ_ONLY`

  A value of 1 indicates the transaction is read only.
- `TRX_AUTOCOMMIT_NON_LOCKING`

  A value of 1 indicates the transaction is a
  [`SELECT`](select.md "15.2.13 SELECT Statement") statement that does not
  use the `FOR UPDATE` or `LOCK IN
  SHARED MODE` clauses, and is executing with
  [`autocommit`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_autocommit) enabled so that
  the transaction contains only this one statement. When this
  column and `TRX_IS_READ_ONLY` are both 1,
  `InnoDB` optimizes the transaction to reduce
  the overhead associated with transactions that change table
  data.
- `TRX_SCHEDULE_WEIGHT`

  The transaction schedule weight assigned by the
  Contention-Aware Transaction Scheduling (CATS) algorithm to
  transactions waiting for a lock. The value is relative to the
  values of other transactions. A higher value has a greater
  weight. A value is computed only for transactions in a
  `LOCK WAIT` state, as reported by the
  `TRX_STATE` column. A NULL value is reported
  for transactions that are not waiting for a lock. The
  `TRX_SCHEDULE_WEIGHT` value is different from
  the `TRX_WEIGHT` value, which is computed by
  a different algorithm for a different purpose.
