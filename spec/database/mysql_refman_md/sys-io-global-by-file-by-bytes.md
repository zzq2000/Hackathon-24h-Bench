#### 30.4.3.11 The io\_global\_by\_file\_by\_bytes and x$io\_global\_by\_file\_by\_bytes Views

These views summarize global I/O consumers to display amount
of I/O, grouped by file. By default, rows are sorted by
descending total I/O (bytes read and written).

The [`io_global_by_file_by_bytes`](sys-io-global-by-file-by-bytes.md "30.4.3.11 The io_global_by_file_by_bytes and x$io_global_by_file_by_bytes Views")
and [`x$io_global_by_file_by_bytes`](sys-io-global-by-file-by-bytes.md "30.4.3.11 The io_global_by_file_by_bytes and x$io_global_by_file_by_bytes Views")
views have these columns:

- `file`

  The file path name.
- `count_read`

  The total number of read events for the file.
- `total_read`

  The total number of bytes read from the file.
- `avg_read`

  The average number of bytes per read from the file.
- `count_write`

  The total number of write events for the file.
- `total_written`

  The total number of bytes written to the file.
- `avg_write`

  The average number of bytes per write to the file.
- `total`
