## 29.11 Performance Schema General Table Characteristics

The name of the `performance_schema` database is
lowercase, as are the names of tables within it. Queries should
specify the names in lowercase.

Many tables in the `performance_schema` database
are read only and cannot be modified:

```sql
mysql> TRUNCATE TABLE performance_schema.setup_instruments;
ERROR 1683 (HY000): Invalid performance_schema usage.
```

Some of the setup tables have columns that can be modified to
affect Performance Schema operation; some also permit rows to be
inserted or deleted. Truncation is permitted to clear collected
events, so [`TRUNCATE TABLE`](truncate-table.md "15.1.37 TRUNCATE TABLE Statement") can be
used on tables containing those kinds of information, such as
tables named with a prefix of `events_waits_`.

Summary tables can be truncated with [`TRUNCATE
TABLE`](truncate-table.md "15.1.37 TRUNCATE TABLE Statement"). Generally, the effect is to reset the summary
columns to 0 or `NULL`, not to remove rows. This
enables you to clear collected values and restart aggregation.
That might be useful, for example, after you have made a runtime
configuration change. Exceptions to this truncation behavior are
noted in individual summary table sections.

Privileges are as for other databases and tables:

- To retrieve from `performance_schema` tables,
  you must have the [`SELECT`](privileges-provided.md#priv_select)
  privilege.
- To change those columns that can be modified, you must have
  the [`UPDATE`](privileges-provided.md#priv_update) privilege.
- To truncate tables that can be truncated, you must have the
  [`DROP`](privileges-provided.md#priv_drop) privilege.

Because only a limited set of privileges apply to Performance
Schema tables, attempts to use `GRANT ALL` as
shorthand for granting privileges at the database or table level
fail with an error:

```sql
mysql> GRANT ALL ON performance_schema.*
       TO 'u1'@'localhost';
ERROR 1044 (42000): Access denied for user 'root'@'localhost'
to database 'performance_schema'
mysql> GRANT ALL ON performance_schema.setup_instruments
       TO 'u2'@'localhost';
ERROR 1044 (42000): Access denied for user 'root'@'localhost'
to database 'performance_schema'
```

Instead, grant exactly the desired privileges:

```sql
mysql> GRANT SELECT ON performance_schema.*
       TO 'u1'@'localhost';
Query OK, 0 rows affected (0.03 sec)

mysql> GRANT SELECT, UPDATE ON performance_schema.setup_instruments
       TO 'u2'@'localhost';
Query OK, 0 rows affected (0.02 sec)
```
