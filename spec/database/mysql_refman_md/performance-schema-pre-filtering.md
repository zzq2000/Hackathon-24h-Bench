### 29.4.3 Event Pre-Filtering

Pre-filtering is done by the Performance Schema and has a global
effect that applies to all users. Pre-filtering can be applied
to either the producer or consumer stage of event processing:

- To configure pre-filtering at the producer stage, several
  tables can be used:

  - [`setup_instruments`](performance-schema-setup-instruments-table.md "29.12.2.3 The setup_instruments Table") indicates
    which instruments are available. An instrument disabled
    in this table produces no events regardless of the
    contents of the other production-related setup tables.
    An instrument enabled in this table is permitted to
    produce events, subject to the contents of the other
    tables.
  - [`setup_objects`](performance-schema-setup-objects-table.md "29.12.2.4 The setup_objects Table") controls
    whether the Performance Schema monitors particular table
    and stored program objects.
  - [`threads`](performance-schema-threads-table.md "29.12.21.8 The threads Table") indicates whether
    monitoring is enabled for each server thread.
  - [`setup_actors`](performance-schema-setup-actors-table.md "29.12.2.1 The setup_actors Table") determines the
    initial monitoring state for new foreground threads.
- To configure pre-filtering at the consumer stage, modify the
  [`setup_consumers`](performance-schema-setup-consumers-table.md "29.12.2.2 The setup_consumers Table") table. This
  determines the destinations to which events are sent.
  [`setup_consumers`](performance-schema-setup-consumers-table.md "29.12.2.2 The setup_consumers Table") also implicitly
  affects event production. If a given event is not sent to
  any destination (that is, it is never consumed), the
  Performance Schema does not produce it.

Modifications to any of these tables affect monitoring
immediately, with the exception that modifications to the
[`setup_actors`](performance-schema-setup-actors-table.md "29.12.2.1 The setup_actors Table") table affect only
foreground threads created subsequent to the modification, not
existing threads.

When you change the monitoring configuration, the Performance
Schema does not flush the history tables. Events already
collected remain in the current-events and history tables until
displaced by newer events. If you disable instruments, you might
need to wait a while before events for them are displaced by
newer events of interest. Alternatively, use
[`TRUNCATE TABLE`](truncate-table.md "15.1.37 TRUNCATE TABLE Statement") to empty the
history tables.

After making instrumentation changes, you might want to truncate
the summary tables. Generally, the effect is to reset the
summary columns to 0 or `NULL`, not to remove
rows. This enables you to clear collected values and restart
aggregation. That might be useful, for example, after you have
made a runtime configuration change. Exceptions to this
truncation behavior are noted in individual summary table
sections.

The following sections describe how to use specific tables to
control Performance Schema pre-filtering.
