#### 13.4.2.8 GeometryCollection Class

A `GeomCollection` is a geometry that is a
collection of zero or more geometries of any class.

`GeomCollection` and
`GeometryCollection` are synonymous, with
`GeomCollection` the preferred type name.

All the elements in a geometry collection must be in the same
spatial reference system (that is, in the same coordinate
system). There are no other constraints on the elements of a
geometry collection, although the subclasses of
`GeomCollection` described in the following
sections may restrict membership. Restrictions may be based
on:

- Element type (for example, a `MultiPoint`
  may contain only `Point` elements)
- Dimension
- Constraints on the degree of spatial overlap between
  elements
