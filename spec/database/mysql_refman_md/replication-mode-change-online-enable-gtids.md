#### 19.1.4.2 Enabling GTID Transactions Online

This section describes how to enable GTID transactions, and
optionally auto-positioning, on servers that are already online
and using anonymous transactions. This procedure does not require
taking the server offline and is suited to use in production.
However, if you have the possibility to take the servers offline
when enabling GTID transactions that process is easier.

Beginning with MySQL 8.0.23, you can set up replication channels
to assign GTIDs to replicated transactions that do not already
have any. This feature enables replication from a source server
that does not use GTID-based replication, to a replica that does.
If it is possible to enable GTIDs on the replication source
server, as described in this procedure, use this approach instead.
Assigning GTIDs is designed for replication source servers where
you cannot enable GTIDs. For more information on this option, see
[Section 19.1.3.6, “Replication From a Source Without GTIDs to a Replica With GTIDs”](replication-gtids-assign-anon.md "19.1.3.6 Replication From a Source Without GTIDs to a Replica With GTIDs").

Before you start, ensure that the servers meet the following
pre-conditions:

- *All* servers in your topology must use
  MySQL 5.7.6 or later. You cannot enable GTID transactions
  online on any single server unless *all*
  servers which are in the topology are using this version.
- All servers have [`gtid_mode`](replication-options-gtids.md#sysvar_gtid_mode)
  set to the default value `OFF`.

The following procedure can be paused at any time and later
resumed where it was, or reversed by jumping to the corresponding
step of
[Section 19.1.4.3, “Disabling GTID Transactions Online”](replication-mode-change-online-disable-gtids.md "19.1.4.3 Disabling GTID Transactions Online"),
the online procedure to disable GTIDs. This makes the procedure
fault-tolerant because any unrelated issues that may appear in the
middle of the procedure can be handled as usual, and then the
procedure continued where it was left off.

Note

It is crucial that you complete every step before continuing to
the next step.

To enable GTID transactions:

1. On each server, execute:

   ```sql
   SET @@GLOBAL.ENFORCE_GTID_CONSISTENCY = WARN;
   ```

   Let the server run for a while with your normal workload and
   monitor the logs. If this step causes any warnings in the log,
   adjust your application so that it only uses GTID-compatible
   features and does not generate any warnings.

   Important

   This is the first important step. You must ensure that no
   warnings are being generated in the error logs before going
   to the next step.
2. On each server, execute:

   ```sql
   SET @@GLOBAL.ENFORCE_GTID_CONSISTENCY = ON;
   ```
3. On each server, execute:

   ```sql
   SET @@GLOBAL.GTID_MODE = OFF_PERMISSIVE;
   ```

   It does not matter which server executes this statement first,
   but it is important that all servers complete this step before
   any server begins the next step.
4. On each server, execute:

   ```sql
   SET @@GLOBAL.GTID_MODE = ON_PERMISSIVE;
   ```

   It does not matter which server executes this statement first.
5. On each server, wait until the status variable
   `ONGOING_ANONYMOUS_TRANSACTION_COUNT` is
   zero. This can be checked using:

   ```sql
   SHOW STATUS LIKE 'ONGOING_ANONYMOUS_TRANSACTION_COUNT';
   ```

   Note

   On a replica, it is theoretically possible that this shows
   zero and then nonzero again. This is not a problem, it
   suffices that it shows zero once.
6. Wait for all transactions generated up to step 5 to replicate
   to all servers. You can do this without stopping updates: the
   only important thing is that all anonymous transactions get
   replicated.

   See
   [Section 19.1.4.4, “Verifying Replication of Anonymous Transactions”](replication-mode-change-online-verify-transactions.md "19.1.4.4 Verifying Replication of Anonymous Transactions")
   for one method of checking that all anonymous transactions
   have replicated to all servers.
7. If you use binary logs for anything other than replication,
   for example point in time backup and restore, wait until you
   do not need the old binary logs having transactions without
   GTIDs.

   For instance, after step 6 has completed, you can execute
   [`FLUSH LOGS`](flush.md#flush-logs) on the server where
   you are taking backups. Then either explicitly take a backup
   or wait for the next iteration of any periodic backup routine
   you may have set up.

   Ideally, wait for the server to purge all binary logs that
   existed when step 6 was completed. Also wait for any backup
   taken before step 6 to expire.

   Important

   This is the second important point. It is vital to
   understand that binary logs containing anonymous
   transactions, without GTIDs cannot be used after the next
   step. After this step, you must be sure that transactions
   without GTIDs do not exist anywhere in the topology.
8. On each server, execute:

   ```sql
   SET @@GLOBAL.GTID_MODE = ON;
   ```
9. On each server, add `gtid_mode=ON` and
   `enforce_gtid_consistency=ON` to
   `my.cnf`.

   You are now guaranteed that all transactions have a GTID
   (except transactions generated in step 5 or earlier, which
   have already been processed). To start using the GTID protocol
   so that you can later perform automatic fail-over, execute the
   following on each replica. Optionally, if you use multi-source
   replication, do this for each channel and include the
   `FOR CHANNEL
   channel` clause:

   ```sql
   STOP SLAVE [FOR CHANNEL 'channel'];
   CHANGE MASTER TO MASTER_AUTO_POSITION = 1 [FOR CHANNEL 'channel'];
   START SLAVE [FOR CHANNEL 'channel'];

   Or from MySQL 8.0.22 / 8.0.23:
   STOP REPLICA [FOR CHANNEL 'channel'];
   CHANGE REPLICATION SOURCE TO SOURCE_AUTO_POSITION = 1 [FOR CHANNEL 'channel'];
   START REPLICA [FOR CHANNEL 'channel'];
   ```
