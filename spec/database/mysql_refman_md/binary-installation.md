## 2.2 Installing MySQL on Unix/Linux Using Generic Binaries

Oracle provides a set of binary distributions of MySQL. These
include generic binary distributions in the form of compressed
**tar** files (files with a
`.tar.xz` extension) for a number of platforms,
and binaries in platform-specific package formats for selected
platforms.

This section covers the installation of MySQL from a compressed
**tar** file binary distribution on Unix/Linux
platforms. For Linux-generic binary distribution installation
instructions with a focus on MySQL security features, refer to the
[Secure
Deployment Guide](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/mysql-secure-deployment-guide/8.0/en/). For other platform-specific binary package
formats, see the other platform-specific sections in this manual.
For example, for Windows distributions, see
[Section 2.3, “Installing MySQL on Microsoft Windows”](windows-installation.md "2.3 Installing MySQL on Microsoft Windows"). See
[Section 2.1.3, “How to Get MySQL”](getting-mysql.md "2.1.3 How to Get MySQL") on how to obtain MySQL in different
distribution formats.

MySQL compressed **tar** file binary distributions
have names of the form
`mysql-VERSION-OS.tar.xz`,
where `VERSION` is a
number (for example, `8.0.45`), and
*`OS`* indicates the type of operating system
for which the distribution is intended (for example,
`pc-linux-i686` or `winx64`).

There is also a “minimal install” version of the MySQL
compressed **tar** file for the Linux generic binary
distribution, which has a name of the form
`mysql-VERSION-OS-GLIBCVER-ARCH-minimal.tar.xz`.
The minimal install distribution excludes debug binaries and is
stripped of debug symbols, making it significantly smaller than the
regular binary distribution. If you choose to install the minimal
install distribution, remember to adjust for the difference in file
name format in the instructions that follow.

Warnings

- If you have previously installed MySQL using your operating
  system native package management system, such as Yum or APT,
  you may experience problems installing using a native binary.
  Make sure your previous MySQL installation has been removed
  entirely (using your package management system), and that any
  additional files, such as old versions of your data files,
  have also been removed. You should also check for
  configuration files such as `/etc/my.cnf`
  or the `/etc/mysql` directory and delete
  them.

  For information about replacing third-party packages with
  official MySQL packages, see the related
  [APT
  guide](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/mysql-apt-repo-quick-guide/en/) or [Yum
  guide](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/replace-third-party-yum.html).
- MySQL has a dependency on the `libaio`
  library. Data directory initialization and subsequent server
  startup steps fail if this library is not installed locally.
  If necessary, install it using the appropriate package
  manager. For example, on Yum-based systems:

  ```terminal
  $> yum search libaio  # search for info
  $> yum install libaio # install library
  ```

  Or, on APT-based systems:

  ```terminal
  $> apt-cache search libaio # search for info
  $> apt-get install libaio1 # install library
  ```
- **Oracle Linux 8 / Red Hat 8**
  (EL8): These platforms by default do not install the file
  `/lib64/libtinfo.so.5`, which is required
  by the MySQL client **bin/mysql** for packages
  `mysql-VERSION-el7-x86_64.tar.gz` and
  `mysql-VERSION-linux-glibc2.12-x86_64.tar.xz`.
  To work around this issue, install the
  `ncurses-compat-libs` package:

  ```terminal
  $> yum install ncurses-compat-libs
  ```
- If no RPM or `.deb` file specific to your
  distribution is provided by Oracle (or by your Linux vendor),
  you can try the generic binaries. In some cases, due to
  library incompatibilities or other issues, these may not work
  with your Linux installation. In such cases, you can try to
  compile and install MySQL from source. See
  [Section 2.8, “Installing MySQL from Source”](source-installation.md "2.8 Installing MySQL from Source"), for more information
  and instructions

To install a compressed **tar** file binary
distribution, unpack it at the installation location you choose
(typically `/usr/local/mysql`). This creates the
directories shown in the following table.

**Table 2.3 MySQL Installation Layout for Generic Unix/Linux Binary Package**

| Directory | Contents of Directory |
| --- | --- |
| `bin` | [**mysqld**](mysqld.md "6.3.1 mysqld — The MySQL Server") server, client and utility programs |
| `docs` | MySQL manual in Info format |
| `man` | Unix manual pages |
| `include` | Include (header) files |
| `lib` | Libraries |
| `share` | Error messages, dictionary, and SQL for database installation |
| `support-files` | Miscellaneous support files |

Debug versions of the [**mysqld**](mysqld.md "6.3.1 mysqld — The MySQL Server") binary are available
as [**mysqld-debug**](mysqld.md "6.3.1 mysqld — The MySQL Server"). To compile your own debug
version of MySQL from a source distribution, use the appropriate
configuration options to enable debugging support. See
[Section 2.8, “Installing MySQL from Source”](source-installation.md "2.8 Installing MySQL from Source").

To install and use a MySQL binary distribution, the command sequence
looks like this:

```terminal
$> groupadd mysql
$> useradd -r -g mysql -s /bin/false mysql
$> cd /usr/local
$> tar xvf /path/to/mysql-VERSION-OS.tar.xz
$> ln -s full-path-to-mysql-VERSION-OS mysql
$> cd mysql
$> mkdir mysql-files
$> chown mysql:mysql mysql-files
$> chmod 750 mysql-files
$> bin/mysqld --initialize --user=mysql
$> bin/mysql_ssl_rsa_setup
$> bin/mysqld_safe --user=mysql &
# Next command is optional
$> cp support-files/mysql.server /etc/init.d/mysql.server
```

Note

This procedure assumes that you have `root`
(administrator) access to your system. Alternatively, you can
prefix each command using the **sudo** (Linux) or
**pfexec** (Solaris) command.

The `mysql-files` directory provides a convenient
location to use as the value for the
`secure_file_priv` system variable, which limits
import and export operations to a specific directory. See
[Section 7.1.8, “Server System Variables”](server-system-variables.md "7.1.8 Server System Variables").

A more detailed version of the preceding description for installing
a binary distribution follows.

### Create a mysql User and Group

If your system does not already have a user and group to use for
running [**mysqld**](mysqld.md "6.3.1 mysqld — The MySQL Server"), you may need to create them. The
following commands add the `mysql` group and the
`mysql` user. You might want to call the user and
group something else instead of `mysql`. If so,
substitute the appropriate name in the following instructions. The
syntax for **useradd** and
**groupadd** may differ slightly on different
versions of Unix/Linux, or they may have different names such as
**adduser** and **addgroup**.

```terminal
$> groupadd mysql
$> useradd -r -g mysql -s /bin/false mysql
```

Note

Because the user is required only for ownership purposes, not
login purposes, the **useradd** command uses the
`-r` and `-s /bin/false` options to
create a user that does not have login permissions to your server
host. Omit these options if your **useradd** does
not support them.

### Obtain and Unpack the Distribution

Pick the directory under which you want to unpack the distribution
and change location into it. The example here unpacks the
distribution under `/usr/local`. The
instructions, therefore, assume that you have permission to create
files and directories in `/usr/local`. If that
directory is protected, you must perform the installation as
`root`.

```terminal
$> cd /usr/local
```

Obtain a distribution file using the instructions in
[Section 2.1.3, “How to Get MySQL”](getting-mysql.md "2.1.3 How to Get MySQL"). For a given release, binary
distributions for all platforms are built from the same MySQL source
distribution.

Unpack the distribution, which creates the installation directory.
**tar** can uncompress and unpack the distribution if
it has `z` option support:

```terminal
$> tar xvf /path/to/mysql-VERSION-OS.tar.xz
```

The **tar** command creates a directory named
`mysql-VERSION-OS`.

To install MySQL from a compressed **tar** file
binary distribution, your system must have GNU `XZ
Utils` to uncompress the distribution and a reasonable
**tar** to unpack it.

Note

The compression algorithm changed from Gzip to XZ in MySQL Server
8.0.12; and the generic binary's file extension changed from
.tar.gz to .tar.xz.

GNU **tar** is known to work. The standard
**tar** provided with some operating systems is not
able to unpack the long file names in the MySQL distribution. You
should download and install GNU **tar**, or if
available, use a preinstalled version of GNU tar. Usually this is
available as **gnutar**, **gtar**, or
as **tar** within a GNU or Free Software directory,
such as `/usr/sfw/bin` or
`/usr/local/bin`. GNU **tar** is
available from <http://www.gnu.org/software/tar/>.

If your **tar** does not support the
`xz` format then use the **xz**
command to unpack the distribution and **tar** to
unpack it. Replace the preceding **tar** command with
the following alternative command to uncompress and extract the
distribution:

```terminal
$> xz -dc /path/to/mysql-VERSION-OS.tar.xz | tar x
```

Next, create a symbolic link to the installation directory created
by **tar**:

```terminal
$> ln -s full-path-to-mysql-VERSION-OS mysql
```

The `ln` command makes a symbolic link to the
installation directory. This enables you to refer more easily to it
as `/usr/local/mysql`. To avoid having to type
the path name of client programs always when you are working with
MySQL, you can add the `/usr/local/mysql/bin`
directory to your `PATH` variable:

```terminal
$> export PATH=$PATH:/usr/local/mysql/bin
```

### Perform Postinstallation Setup

The remainder of the installation process involves setting
distribution ownership and access permissions, initializing the data
directory, starting the MySQL server, and setting up the
configuration file. For instructions, see
[Section 2.9, “Postinstallation Setup and Testing”](postinstallation.md "2.9 Postinstallation Setup and Testing").
