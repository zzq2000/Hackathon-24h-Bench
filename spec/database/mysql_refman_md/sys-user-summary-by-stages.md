#### 30.4.3.44 The user\_summary\_by\_stages and x$user\_summary\_by\_stages Views

These views summarize stages, grouped by user. By default,
rows are sorted by user and descending total stage latency.

The [`user_summary_by_stages`](sys-user-summary-by-stages.md "30.4.3.44 The user_summary_by_stages and x$user_summary_by_stages Views") and
[`x$user_summary_by_stages`](sys-user-summary-by-stages.md "30.4.3.44 The user_summary_by_stages and x$user_summary_by_stages Views") views
have these columns:

- `user`

  The client user name. Rows for which the
  `USER` column in the underlying
  Performance Schema table is `NULL` are
  assumed to be for background threads and are reported with
  a host name of `background`.
- `event_name`

  The stage event name.
- `total`

  The total number of occurrences of the stage event for the
  user.
- `total_latency`

  The total wait time of timed occurrences of the stage
  event for the user.
- `avg_latency`

  The average wait time per timed occurrence of the stage
  event for the user.
