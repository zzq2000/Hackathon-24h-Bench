#### 1.6.3.3 Enforced Constraints on Invalid Data

By default, MySQL 8.0 rejects invalid or improper data values
and aborts the statement in which they occur. It is possible
to alter this behavior to be more forgiving of invalid values,
such that the server coerces them to valid ones for data
entry, by disabling strict SQL mode (see
[Section 7.1.11, “Server SQL Modes”](sql-mode.md "7.1.11 Server SQL Modes")), but this is not recommended.

Older versions of MySQL employed the forgiving behavior by
default; for a description of this behavior, see
[Constraints on Invalid Data](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/constraint-invalid-data.html).
