#### 25.6.8.1 NDB Cluster Backup Concepts

A backup is a snapshot of the database at a given time. The
backup consists of three main parts:

- **Metadata.**
  The names and definitions of all database tables
- **Table records.**
  The data actually stored in the database tables at the
  time that the backup was made
- **Transaction log.**
  A sequential record telling how and when data was stored
  in the database

Each of these parts is saved on all nodes participating in the
backup. During backup, each node saves these three parts into
three files on disk:

- `BACKUP-backup_id.node_id.ctl`

  A control file containing control information and metadata.
  Each node saves the same table definitions (for all tables
  in the cluster) to its own version of this file.
- `BACKUP-backup_id-0.node_id.data`

  A data file containing the table records, which are saved on
  a per-fragment basis. That is, different nodes save
  different fragments during the backup. The file saved by
  each node starts with a header that states the tables to
  which the records belong. Following the list of records
  there is a footer containing a checksum for all records.
- `BACKUP-backup_id.node_id.log`

  A log file containing records of committed transactions.
  Only transactions on tables stored in the backup are stored
  in the log. Nodes involved in the backup save different
  records because different nodes host different database
  fragments.

In the listing just shown, *`backup_id`*
stands for the backup identifier and
*`node_id`* is the unique identifier for
the node creating the file.

The location of the backup files is determined by the
[`BackupDataDir`](mysql-cluster-ndbd-definition.md#ndbparam-ndbd-backupdatadir) parameter.
