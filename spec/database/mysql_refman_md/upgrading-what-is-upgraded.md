## 3.4 What the MySQL Upgrade Process Upgrades

Installing a new version of MySQL may require upgrading these
parts of the existing installation:

- The `mysql` system schema, which contains
  tables that store information required by the MySQL server as
  it runs (see [Section 7.3, “The mysql System Schema”](system-schema.md "7.3 The mysql System Schema")).
  `mysql` schema tables fall into two broad
  categories:

  - Data dictionary tables, which store database object
    metadata.
  - System tables (that is, the remaining non-data dictionary
    tables), which are used for other operational purposes.
- Other schemas, some of which are built in and may be
  considered “owned” by the server, and others
  which are not:

  - The [`performance_schema`](performance-schema.md "Chapter 29 MySQL Performance Schema"),
    [`INFORMATION_SCHEMA`](information-schema.md "Chapter 28 INFORMATION_SCHEMA Tables"),
    [`ndbinfo`](mysql-cluster-ndbinfo.md "25.6.16 ndbinfo: The NDB Cluster Information Database"), and
    [`sys`](sys-schema.md "Chapter 30 MySQL sys Schema") schemas.
  - User schemas.

Two distinct version numbers are associated with parts of the
installation that may require upgrading:

- The data dictionary version. This applies to the data
  dictionary tables.
- The server version, also known as the MySQL version. This
  applies to the system tables and objects in other schemas.

In both cases, the actual version applicable to the existing MySQL
installation is stored in the data dictionary, and the current
expected version is compiled into the new version of MySQL. When
an actual version is lower than the current expected version,
those parts of the installation associated with that version must
be upgraded to the current version. If both versions indicate an
upgrade is needed, the data dictionary upgrade must occur first.

As a reflection of the two distinct versions just mentioned, the
upgrade occurs in two steps:

- Step 1: Data dictionary upgrade.

  This step upgrades:

  - The data dictionary tables in the `mysql`
    schema. If the actual data dictionary version is lower
    than the current expected version, the server creates data
    dictionary tables with updated definitions, copies
    persisted metadata to the new tables, atomically replaces
    the old tables with the new ones, and reinitializes the
    data dictionary.
  - The Performance Schema,
    `INFORMATION_SCHEMA`, and
    `ndbinfo`.
- Step 2: Server upgrade.

  This step comprises all other upgrade tasks. If the server
  version of the existing MySQL installation is lower than that
  of the new installed MySQL version, everything else must be
  upgraded:

  - The system tables in the `mysql` schema
    (the remaining non-data dictionary tables).
  - The `sys` schema.
  - User schemas.

The data dictionary upgrade (step 1) is the responsibility of the
server, which performs this task as necessary at startup unless
invoked with an option that prevents it from doing so. The option
is [`--upgrade=NONE`](server-options.md#option_mysqld_upgrade) as of MySQL
8.0.16, [`--no-dd-upgrade`](server-options.md#option_mysqld_no-dd-upgrade) prior to
MySQL 8.0.16.

If the data dictionary is out of date but the server is prevented
from upgrading it, the server does not run, and exits with an
error instead. For example:

```none
[ERROR] [MY-013381] [Server] Server shutting down because upgrade is
required, yet prohibited by the command line option '--upgrade=NONE'.
[ERROR] [MY-010334] [Server] Failed to initialize DD Storage Engine
[ERROR] [MY-010020] [Server] Data Dictionary initialization failed.
```

Some changes to the responsibility for step 2 occurred in MySQL
8.0.16:

- Prior to MySQL 8.0.16, [**mysql\_upgrade**](mysql-upgrade.md "6.4.5 mysql_upgrade — Check and Upgrade MySQL Tables")
  upgrades the Performance Schema, the
  `INFORMATION_SCHEMA`, and the objects
  described in step 2. The DBA is expected to invoke
  [**mysql\_upgrade**](mysql-upgrade.md "6.4.5 mysql_upgrade — Check and Upgrade MySQL Tables") manually after starting the
  server.
- As of MySQL 8.0.16, the server performs all tasks previously
  handled by [**mysql\_upgrade**](mysql-upgrade.md "6.4.5 mysql_upgrade — Check and Upgrade MySQL Tables"). Although
  upgrading remains a two-step operation, the server performs
  them both, resulting in a simpler process.

Depending on the version of MySQL to which you are upgrading, the
instructions in [In-Place Upgrade](upgrade-binary-package.md#upgrade-procedure-inplace "In-Place Upgrade") and
[Logical Upgrade](upgrade-binary-package.md#upgrade-procedure-logical "Logical Upgrade") indicate whether the
server performs all upgrade tasks or whether you must also invoke
[**mysql\_upgrade**](mysql-upgrade.md "6.4.5 mysql_upgrade — Check and Upgrade MySQL Tables") after server startup.

Note

Because the server upgrades the Performance Schema,
`INFORMATION_SCHEMA`, and the objects described
in step 2 as of MySQL 8.0.16, [**mysql\_upgrade**](mysql-upgrade.md "6.4.5 mysql_upgrade — Check and Upgrade MySQL Tables")
is unneeded and is deprecated as of that version; expect it to
be removed in a future version of MySQL.

Most aspects of what occurs during step 2 are the same prior to
and as of MySQL 8.0.16, although different command options may be
needed to achieve a particular effect.

As of MySQL 8.0.16, the [`--upgrade`](server-options.md#option_mysqld_upgrade)
server option controls whether and how the server performs an
automatic upgrade at startup:

- With no option or with
  [`--upgrade=AUTO`](server-options.md#option_mysqld_upgrade), the server
  upgrades anything it determines to be out of date (steps 1 and
  2).
- With [`--upgrade=NONE`](server-options.md#option_mysqld_upgrade), the server
  upgrades nothing (skips steps 1 and 2), but also exits with an
  error if the data dictionary must be upgraded. It is not
  possible to run the server with an out-of-date data
  dictionary; the server insists on either upgrading it or
  exiting.
- With [`--upgrade=MINIMAL`](server-options.md#option_mysqld_upgrade), the
  server upgrades the data dictionary, the Performance Schema,
  and the `INFORMATION_SCHEMA`, if necessary
  (step 1). Note that following an upgrade with this option,
  Group Replication cannot be started, because system tables on
  which the replication internals depend are not updated, and
  reduced functionality might also be apparent in other areas.
- With [`--upgrade=FORCE`](server-options.md#option_mysqld_upgrade), the
  server upgrades the data dictionary, the Performance Schema,
  and the `INFORMATION_SCHEMA`, if necessary
  (step 1), and forces an upgrade of everything else (step 2).
  Expect server startup to take longer with this option because
  the server checks all objects in all schemas.

`FORCE` is useful to force step 2 actions to be
performed if the server thinks they are not necessary. One way
that `FORCE` differs from `AUTO`
is that with `FORCE`, the server re-creates
system tables such as help tables or time zone tables if they are
missing.

The following list shows upgrade commands prior to MySQL 8.0.16
and the equivalent commands for MySQL 8.0.16 and higher:

- Perform a normal upgrade (steps 1 and 2 as necessary):

  - Prior to MySQL 8.0.16: [**mysqld**](mysqld.md "6.3.1 mysqld — The MySQL Server") followed
    by [**mysql\_upgrade**](mysql-upgrade.md "6.4.5 mysql_upgrade — Check and Upgrade MySQL Tables")
  - As of MySQL 8.0.16: [**mysqld**](mysqld.md "6.3.1 mysqld — The MySQL Server")
- Perform only step 1 as necessary:

  - Prior to MySQL 8.0.16: It is not possible to perform all
    upgrade tasks described in step 1 while excluding those
    described in step 2. However, you can avoid upgrading user
    schemas and the `sys` schema using
    [**mysqld**](mysqld.md "6.3.1 mysqld — The MySQL Server") followed by
    [**mysql\_upgrade**](mysql-upgrade.md "6.4.5 mysql_upgrade — Check and Upgrade MySQL Tables") with the
    [`--upgrade-system-tables`](mysql-upgrade.md#option_mysql_upgrade_upgrade-system-tables)
    and
    [`--skip-sys-schema`](mysql-upgrade.md#option_mysql_upgrade_skip-sys-schema)
    options.
  - As of MySQL 8.0.16: [**mysqld
    --upgrade=MINIMAL**](mysqld.md "6.3.1 mysqld — The MySQL Server")
- Perform step 1 as necessary, and force step 2:

  - Prior to MySQL 8.0.16: [**mysqld**](mysqld.md "6.3.1 mysqld — The MySQL Server") followed
    by [**mysql\_upgrade --force**](mysql-upgrade.md "6.4.5 mysql_upgrade — Check and Upgrade MySQL Tables")
  - As of MySQL 8.0.16: [**mysqld
    --upgrade=FORCE**](mysqld.md "6.3.1 mysqld — The MySQL Server")

Prior to MySQL 8.0.16, certain [**mysql\_upgrade**](mysql-upgrade.md "6.4.5 mysql_upgrade — Check and Upgrade MySQL Tables")
options affect the actions it performs. The following table shows
which server `--upgrade` option values to use as of
MySQL 8.0.16 to achieve similar effects. (These are not
necessarily exact equivalents because a given
`--upgrade` option value may have additional
effects.)

| mysql\_upgrade Option | Server Option |
| --- | --- |
| [`--skip-sys-schema`](mysql-upgrade.md#option_mysql_upgrade_skip-sys-schema) | [`--upgrade=NONE`](server-options.md#option_mysqld_upgrade) or [`--upgrade=MINIMAL`](server-options.md#option_mysqld_upgrade) |
| [`--upgrade-system-tables`](mysql-upgrade.md#option_mysql_upgrade_upgrade-system-tables) | [`--upgrade=NONE`](server-options.md#option_mysqld_upgrade) or [`--upgrade=MINIMAL`](server-options.md#option_mysqld_upgrade) |
| [`--force`](mysql-upgrade.md#option_mysql_upgrade_force) | [`--upgrade=FORCE`](server-options.md#option_mysqld_upgrade) |

Additional notes about what occurs during upgrade step 2:

- Step 2 installs the `sys` schema if it is not
  installed, and upgrades it to the current version otherwise.
  An error occurs if a `sys` schema exists but
  has no `version` view, on the assumption that
  its absence indicates a user-created schema:

  ```none
  A sys schema exists with no sys.version view. If
  you have a user created sys schema, this must be renamed for the
  upgrade to succeed.
  ```

  To upgrade in this case, remove or rename the existing
  `sys` schema first. Then perform the upgrade
  procedure again. (It may be necessary to force step 2.)

  To prevent the `sys` schema check:

  - As of MySQL 8.0.16: Start the server with the
    `--upgrade=NONE` or
    `--upgrade=MINIMAL` option.
  - Prior to MySQL 8.0.16: Invoke
    [**mysql\_upgrade**](mysql-upgrade.md "6.4.5 mysql_upgrade — Check and Upgrade MySQL Tables") with the
    [`--skip-sys-schema`](mysql-upgrade.md#option_mysql_upgrade_skip-sys-schema)
    option.
- Step 2 upgrades the system tables to ensure that they have the
  current structure. This is true whether the server or
  [**mysql\_upgrade**](mysql-upgrade.md "6.4.5 mysql_upgrade — Check and Upgrade MySQL Tables") performs the step. With
  respect to the content of the help tables and time zone
  tables, [**mysql\_upgrade**](mysql-upgrade.md "6.4.5 mysql_upgrade — Check and Upgrade MySQL Tables") does not load either
  type of table, whereas the server loads the help tables, but
  not the time zone tables. (That is, prior to MySQL 8.0.16, the
  server loads the help tables only at data directory
  initialization time. As of MySQL 8.0.16, it loads the help
  tables at initialization and upgrade time.) The procedure for
  loading time zone tables is platform dependent and requires
  decision making by the DBA, so it cannot be done
  automatically.
- From MySQL 8.0.30, when Step 2 is upgrading the system tables
  in the `mysql` schema, the column order in
  the primary key of the `mysql.db`,
  `mysql.tables_priv`,
  `mysql.columns_priv` and
  `mysql.procs_priv` tables is changed to place
  the host name and user name columns together. Placing the host
  name and user name together means that index lookup can be
  used, which improves performance for
  [`CREATE USER`](create-user.md "15.7.1.3 CREATE USER Statement"),
  [`DROP USER`](drop-user.md "15.7.1.5 DROP USER Statement"), and
  [`RENAME USER`](rename-user.md "15.7.1.7 RENAME USER Statement") statements, and for
  ACL checks for multiple users with multiple privileges.
  Dropping and re-creating the index is necessary and might take
  some time if the system has a large number of users and
  privileges.
- Step 2 processes all tables in all user schemas as necessary.
  Table checking might take a long time to complete. Each table
  is locked and therefore unavailable to other sessions while it
  is being processed. Check and repair operations can be
  time-consuming, particularly for large tables. Table checking
  uses the `FOR UPGRADE` option of the
  [`CHECK TABLE`](check-table.md "15.7.3.2 CHECK TABLE Statement") statement. For
  details about what this option entails, see
  [Section 15.7.3.2, “CHECK TABLE Statement”](check-table.md "15.7.3.2 CHECK TABLE Statement").

  To prevent table checking:

  - As of MySQL 8.0.16: Start the server with the
    `--upgrade=NONE` or
    `--upgrade=MINIMAL` option.
  - Prior to MySQL 8.0.16: Invoke
    [**mysql\_upgrade**](mysql-upgrade.md "6.4.5 mysql_upgrade — Check and Upgrade MySQL Tables") with the
    [`--upgrade-system-tables`](mysql-upgrade.md#option_mysql_upgrade_upgrade-system-tables)
    option.

  To force table checking:

  - As of MySQL 8.0.16: Start the server with the
    `--upgrade=FORCE` option.
  - Prior to MySQL 8.0.16: Invoke
    [**mysql\_upgrade**](mysql-upgrade.md "6.4.5 mysql_upgrade — Check and Upgrade MySQL Tables") with the
    [`--force`](mysql-upgrade.md#option_mysql_upgrade_force) option.
- Step 2 saves the MySQL version number in a file named
  `mysql_upgrade_info` in the data directory.

  To ignore the `mysql_upgrade_info` file and
  perform the check regardless:

  - As of MySQL 8.0.16: Start the server with the
    `--upgrade=FORCE` option.
  - Prior to MySQL 8.0.16: Invoke
    [**mysql\_upgrade**](mysql-upgrade.md "6.4.5 mysql_upgrade — Check and Upgrade MySQL Tables") with the
    [`--force`](mysql-upgrade.md#option_mysql_upgrade_force) option.

  Note

  The `mysql_upgrade_info` file is
  deprecated; expect it to be removed in a future version of
  MySQL.
- Step 2 marks all checked and repaired tables with the current
  MySQL version number. This ensures that the next time upgrade
  checking occurs with the same version of the server, it can be
  determined whether there is any need to check or repair a
  given table again.
