## 17.22 InnoDB Limits

This section describes limits for `InnoDB`
tables, indexes, tablespaces, and other aspects of the
`InnoDB` storage engine.

- A table can contain a maximum of 1017 columns. Virtual
  generated columns are included in this limit.
- A table can contain a maximum of 64
  [secondary indexes](glossary.md#glos_secondary_index "secondary index").
- The index key prefix length limit is 3072 bytes for
  `InnoDB` tables that use
  `DYNAMIC`
  or
  `COMPRESSED`
  row format.

  The index key prefix length limit is 767 bytes for
  `InnoDB` tables that use the
  `REDUNDANT`
  or
  `COMPACT`
  row format. For example, you might hit this limit with a
  [column prefix](glossary.md#glos_column_prefix "column prefix") index
  of more than 191 characters on a `TEXT` or
  `VARCHAR` column, assuming a
  `utf8mb4` character set and the maximum of 4
  bytes for each character.

  Attempting to use an index key prefix length that exceeds the
  limit returns an error.

  If you reduce the `InnoDB`
  [page size](glossary.md#glos_page_size "page size") to 8KB or 4KB
  by specifying the
  [`innodb_page_size`](innodb-parameters.md#sysvar_innodb_page_size) option when
  creating the MySQL instance, the maximum length of the index
  key is lowered proportionally, based on the limit of 3072
  bytes for a 16KB page size. That is, the maximum index key
  length is 1536 bytes when the page size is 8KB, and 768 bytes
  when the page size is 4KB.

  The limits that apply to index key prefixes also apply to
  full-column index keys.
- A maximum of 16 columns is permitted for multicolumn indexes.
  Exceeding the limit returns an error.

  ```sql
  ERROR 1070 (42000): Too many key parts specified; max 16 parts allowed
  ```
- The maximum row size, excluding any variable-length columns
  that are stored off-page, is slightly less than half of a page
  for 4KB, 8KB, 16KB, and 32KB page sizes. For example, the
  maximum row size for the default
  [`innodb_page_size`](innodb-parameters.md#sysvar_innodb_page_size) of 16KB is
  about 8000 bytes. However, for an `InnoDB`
  page size of 64KB, the maximum row size is approximately 16000
  bytes. [`LONGBLOB`](blob.md "13.3.4 The BLOB and TEXT Types") and
  [`LONGTEXT`](blob.md "13.3.4 The BLOB and TEXT Types")
  columns must be less than 4GB, and the total row size,
  including [`BLOB`](blob.md "13.3.4 The BLOB and TEXT Types") and
  [`TEXT`](blob.md "13.3.4 The BLOB and TEXT Types") columns, must be less than
  4GB.

  If a row is less than half a page long, all of it is stored
  locally within the page. If it exceeds half a page,
  variable-length columns are chosen for external off-page
  storage until the row fits within half a page, as described in
  [Section 17.11.2, “File Space Management”](innodb-file-space.md "17.11.2 File Space Management").
- Although `InnoDB` supports row sizes larger
  than 65,535 bytes internally, MySQL itself imposes a row-size
  limit of 65,535 for the combined size of all columns. See
  [Section 10.4.7, “Limits on Table Column Count and Row Size”](column-count-limit.md "10.4.7 Limits on Table Column Count and Row Size").
- The maximum table or tablespace size is impacted by the server
  file system, which can impose a maximum file size that is
  smaller than the internal 64 TiB size limit defined by
  `InnoDB`. For example, the
  *ext4* file system on Linux has a maximum
  file size of 16 TiB, so the maximum table or tablespace size
  becomes 16 TiB instead of 64 TiB. Another example is the
  *FAT32* file system, which has a maximum
  file size of 4 GB.

  If you require a larger system tablespace, configure it using
  several smaller data files rather than one large data file, or
  distribute table data across file-per-table and general
  tablespace data files.
- The combined maximum size for `InnoDB` log
  files is 512GB.
- The minimum tablespace size is slightly larger than 10MB. The
  maximum tablespace size depends on the
  `InnoDB` page size.

  **Table 17.31 InnoDB Maximum Tablespace Size**

  | InnoDB Page Size | Maximum Tablespace Size |
  | --- | --- |
  | 4KB | 16TB |
  | 8KB | 32TB |
  | 16KB | 64TB |
  | 32KB | 128TB |
  | 64KB | 256TB |

  The maximum tablespace size is also the maximum size for a
  table.
- An `InnoDB` instance supports up to 2^32
  (4294967296) tablespaces, with a small number of those
  tablespaces reserved for undo and temporary tables.
- Shared tablespaces support up to 2^32 (4294967296) tables.
- The path of a tablespace file, including the file name, cannot
  exceed the `MAX_PATH` limit on Windows. Prior
  to Windows 10, the `MAX_PATH` limit is 260
  characters. As of Windows 10, version 1607,
  `MAX_PATH` limitations are removed from
  common Win32 file and directory functions, but you must enable
  the new behavior.
- For limits associated with concurrent read-write transactions,
  see [Section 17.6.6, “Undo Logs”](innodb-undo-logs.md "17.6.6 Undo Logs").
