#### 19.5.1.3 Replication and Character Sets

The following applies to replication between MySQL servers that
use different character sets:

- If the source has databases with a character set different
  from the global
  [`character_set_server`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_character_set_server) value,
  you should design your [`CREATE
  TABLE`](create-table.md "15.1.20 CREATE TABLE Statement") statements so that they do not implicitly
  rely on the database default character set. A good
  workaround is to state the character set and collation
  explicitly in [`CREATE TABLE`](create-table.md "15.1.20 CREATE TABLE Statement")
  statements.
