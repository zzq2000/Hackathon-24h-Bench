#### 17.6.3.8 Optimizing Tablespace Space Allocation on Linux

As of MySQL 8.0.22, you can optimize how `InnoDB`
allocates space to file-per-table and general tablespaces on
Linux. By default, when additional space is required,
`InnoDB` allocates pages to the tablespace and
physically writes NULLs to those pages. This behavior can affect
performance if new pages are allocated frequently. As of MySQL
8.0.22, you can disable
[`innodb_extend_and_initialize`](innodb-parameters.md#sysvar_innodb_extend_and_initialize) on
Linux systems to avoid physically writing NULLs to newly allocated
tablespace pages. When
[`innodb_extend_and_initialize`](innodb-parameters.md#sysvar_innodb_extend_and_initialize) is
disabled, space is allocated to tablespace files using
`posix_fallocate()` calls, which reserve space
without physically writing NULLs.

When pages are allocated using
`posix_fallocate()` calls, the extension size is
small by default and pages are often allocated only a few at a
time, which can cause fragmentation and increase random I/O. To
avoid this issue, increase the tablespace extension size when
enabling `posix_fallocate()` calls. Tablespace
extension size can be increased up to 4GB using the
`AUTOEXTEND_SIZE` option. For more information,
see [Section 17.6.3.9, “Tablespace AUTOEXTEND\_SIZE Configuration”](innodb-tablespace-autoextend-size.md "17.6.3.9 Tablespace AUTOEXTEND_SIZE Configuration").

`InnoDB` writes a redo log record before
allocating a new tablespace page. If a page allocation operation
is interrupted, the operation is replayed from the redo log record
during recovery. (A page allocation operation replayed from a redo
log record physically writes NULLs to the newly allocated page.) A
redo log record is written before allocating a page regardless of
the [`innodb_extend_and_initialize`](innodb-parameters.md#sysvar_innodb_extend_and_initialize)
setting.

On non-Linux systems and Windows, `InnoDB`
allocates new pages to the tablespace and physically writes NULLs
to those pages, which is the default behavior. Attempting to
disable
[`innodb_extend_and_initialize`](innodb-parameters.md#sysvar_innodb_extend_and_initialize) on
those systems returns the following error:

Changing innodb\_extend\_and\_initialize not supported on
this platform. Falling back to the default.
