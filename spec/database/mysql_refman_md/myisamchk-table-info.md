#### 6.6.4.5 Obtaining Table Information with myisamchk

To obtain a description of a `MyISAM` table or
statistics about it, use the commands shown here. The output
from these commands is explained later in this section.

- [**myisamchk -d
  *`tbl_name`***](myisamchk.md "6.6.4 myisamchk — MyISAM Table-Maintenance Utility")

  Runs [**myisamchk**](myisamchk.md "6.6.4 myisamchk — MyISAM Table-Maintenance Utility") in “describe
  mode” to produce a description of your table. If you
  start the MySQL server with external locking disabled,
  [**myisamchk**](myisamchk.md "6.6.4 myisamchk — MyISAM Table-Maintenance Utility") may report an error for a table
  that is updated while it runs. However, because
  [**myisamchk**](myisamchk.md "6.6.4 myisamchk — MyISAM Table-Maintenance Utility") does not change the table in
  describe mode, there is no risk of destroying data.
- [**myisamchk -dv
  *`tbl_name`***](myisamchk.md "6.6.4 myisamchk — MyISAM Table-Maintenance Utility")

  Adding `-v` runs [**myisamchk**](myisamchk.md "6.6.4 myisamchk — MyISAM Table-Maintenance Utility")
  in verbose mode so that it produces more information about
  the table. Adding `-v` a second time produces
  even more information.
- [**myisamchk -eis
  *`tbl_name`***](myisamchk.md "6.6.4 myisamchk — MyISAM Table-Maintenance Utility")

  Shows only the most important information from a table. This
  operation is slow because it must read the entire table.
- [**myisamchk -eiv
  *`tbl_name`***](myisamchk.md "6.6.4 myisamchk — MyISAM Table-Maintenance Utility")

  This is like `-eis`, but tells you what is
  being done.

The *`tbl_name`* argument can be either
the name of a `MyISAM` table or the name of its
index file, as described in [Section 6.6.4, “myisamchk — MyISAM Table-Maintenance Utility”](myisamchk.md "6.6.4 myisamchk — MyISAM Table-Maintenance Utility").
Multiple *`tbl_name`* arguments can be
given.

Suppose that a table named `person` has the
following structure. (The `MAX_ROWS` table
option is included so that in the example output from
[**myisamchk**](myisamchk.md "6.6.4 myisamchk — MyISAM Table-Maintenance Utility") shown later, some values are
smaller and fit the output format more easily.)

```sql
CREATE TABLE person
(
  id         INT NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT,
  last_name  VARCHAR(20) NOT NULL,
  first_name VARCHAR(20) NOT NULL,
  birth      DATE,
  death      DATE,
  PRIMARY KEY (id),
  INDEX (last_name, first_name),
  INDEX (birth)
) MAX_ROWS = 1000000 ENGINE=MYISAM;
```

Suppose also that the table has these data and index file sizes:

```terminal
-rw-rw----  1 mysql  mysql  9347072 Aug 19 11:47 person.MYD
-rw-rw----  1 mysql  mysql  6066176 Aug 19 11:47 person.MYI
```

Explanations for the types of information
[**myisamchk**](myisamchk.md "6.6.4 myisamchk — MyISAM Table-Maintenance Utility") produces are given here.
“Keyfile” refers to the index file.
“Record” and “row” are synonymous, as
are “field” and “column.”

The initial part of the table description contains these values:

- `MyISAM file`

  Name of the `MyISAM` (index) file.
- `Record format`

  The format used to store table rows. The preceding examples
  use `Fixed length`. Other possible values
  are `Compressed` and
  `Packed`. (`Packed`
  corresponds to what `SHOW TABLE STATUS`
  reports as `Dynamic`.)
- `Chararacter set`

  The table default character set.
- `File-version`

  Version of `MyISAM` format. Always 1.
- `Creation time`

  When the data file was created.
- `Recover time`

  When the index/data file was last reconstructed.
- `Status`

  Table status flags. Possible values are
  `crashed`, `open`,
  `changed`, `analyzed`,
  `optimized keys`, and `sorted index
  pages`.
- `Auto increment key`, `Last
  value`

  The key number associated the table's
  `AUTO_INCREMENT` column, and the most
  recently generated value for this column. These fields do
  not appear if there is no such column.
- `Data records`

  The number of rows in the table.
- `Deleted blocks`

  How many deleted blocks still have reserved space. You can
  optimize your table to minimize this space. See
  [Section 9.6.4, “MyISAM Table Optimization”](myisam-optimization.md "9.6.4 MyISAM Table Optimization").
- `Datafile parts`

  For dynamic-row format, this indicates how many data blocks
  there are. For an optimized table without fragmented rows,
  this is the same as `Data records`.
- `Deleted data`

  How many bytes of unreclaimed deleted data there are. You
  can optimize your table to minimize this space. See
  [Section 9.6.4, “MyISAM Table Optimization”](myisam-optimization.md "9.6.4 MyISAM Table Optimization").
- `Datafile pointer`

  The size of the data file pointer, in bytes. It is usually
  2, 3, 4, or 5 bytes. Most tables manage with 2 bytes, but
  this cannot be controlled from MySQL yet. For fixed tables,
  this is a row address. For dynamic tables, this is a byte
  address.
- `Keyfile pointer`

  The size of the index file pointer, in bytes. It is usually
  1, 2, or 3 bytes. Most tables manage with 2 bytes, but this
  is calculated automatically by MySQL. It is always a block
  address.
- `Max datafile length`

  How long the table data file can become, in bytes.
- `Max keyfile length`

  How long the table index file can become, in bytes.
- `Recordlength`

  How much space each row takes, in bytes.

The `table description` part of the output
includes a list of all keys in the table. For each key,
[**myisamchk**](myisamchk.md "6.6.4 myisamchk — MyISAM Table-Maintenance Utility") displays some low-level
information:

- `Key`

  This key's number. This value is shown only for the first
  column of the key. If this value is missing, the line
  corresponds to the second or later column of a
  multiple-column key. For the table shown in the example,
  there are two `table description` lines for
  the second index. This indicates that it is a multiple-part
  index with two parts.
- `Start`

  Where in the row this portion of the index starts.
- `Len`

  How long this portion of the index is. For packed numbers,
  this should always be the full length of the column. For
  strings, it may be shorter than the full length of the
  indexed column, because you can index a prefix of a string
  column. The total length of a multiple-part key is the sum
  of the `Len` values for all key parts.
- `Index`

  Whether a key value can exist multiple times in the index.
  Possible values are `unique` or
  `multip.` (multiple).
- `Type`

  What data type this portion of the index has. This is a
  `MyISAM` data type with the possible values
  `packed`, `stripped`, or
  `empty`.
- `Root`

  Address of the root index block.
- `Blocksize`

  The size of each index block. By default this is 1024, but
  the value may be changed at compile time when MySQL is built
  from source.
- `Rec/key`

  This is a statistical value used by the optimizer. It tells
  how many rows there are per value for this index. A unique
  index always has a value of 1. This may be updated after a
  table is loaded (or greatly changed) with [**myisamchk
  -a**](myisamchk.md "6.6.4 myisamchk — MyISAM Table-Maintenance Utility"). If this is not updated at all, a default value
  of 30 is given.

The last part of the output provides information about each
column:

- `Field`

  The column number.
- `Start`

  The byte position of the column within table rows.
- `Length`

  The length of the column in bytes.
- `Nullpos`, `Nullbit`

  For columns that can be `NULL`,
  `MyISAM` stores `NULL`
  values as a flag in a byte. Depending on how many nullable
  columns there are, there can be one or more bytes used for
  this purpose. The `Nullpos` and
  `Nullbit` values, if nonempty, indicate
  which byte and bit contains that flag indicating whether the
  column is `NULL`.

  The position and number of bytes used to store
  `NULL` flags is shown in the line for field
  1. This is why there are six `Field` lines
  for the `person` table even though it has
  only five columns.
- `Type`

  The data type. The value may contain any of the following
  descriptors:

  - `constant`

    All rows have the same value.
  - `no endspace`

    Do not store endspace.
  - `no endspace, not_always`

    Do not store endspace and do not do endspace compression
    for all values.
  - `no endspace, no empty`

    Do not store endspace. Do not store empty values.
  - `table-lookup`

    The column was converted to an
    [`ENUM`](enum.md "13.3.5 The ENUM Type").
  - `zerofill(N)`

    The most significant *`N`* bytes
    in the value are always 0 and are not stored.
  - `no zeros`

    Do not store zeros.
  - `always zero`

    Zero values are stored using one bit.
- `Huff tree`

  The number of the Huffman tree associated with the column.
- `Bits`

  The number of bits used in the Huffman tree.

The `Huff tree` and `Bits`
fields are displayed if the table has been compressed with
[**myisampack**](myisampack.md "6.6.6 myisampack — Generate Compressed, Read-Only MyISAM Tables"). See [Section 6.6.6, “myisampack — Generate Compressed, Read-Only MyISAM Tables”](myisampack.md "6.6.6 myisampack — Generate Compressed, Read-Only MyISAM Tables"),
for an example of this information.

[**myisamchk -eiv**](myisamchk.md "6.6.4 myisamchk — MyISAM Table-Maintenance Utility") output includes the following
information:

- `Data records`

  The number of rows in the table.
- `Deleted blocks`

  How many deleted blocks still have reserved space. You can
  optimize your table to minimize this space. See
  [Section 9.6.4, “MyISAM Table Optimization”](myisam-optimization.md "9.6.4 MyISAM Table Optimization").
- `Key`

  The key number.
- `Keyblocks used`

  What percentage of the keyblocks are used. When a table has
  just been reorganized with [**myisamchk**](myisamchk.md "6.6.4 myisamchk — MyISAM Table-Maintenance Utility"), the
  values are very high (very near theoretical maximum).
- `Packed`

  MySQL tries to pack key values that have a common suffix.
  This can only be used for indexes on
  [`CHAR`](char.md "13.3.2 The CHAR and VARCHAR Types") and
  [`VARCHAR`](char.md "13.3.2 The CHAR and VARCHAR Types") columns. For long
  indexed strings that have similar leftmost parts, this can
  significantly reduce the space used. In the preceding
  example, the second key is 40 bytes long and a 97% reduction
  in space is achieved.
- `Max levels`

  How deep the B-tree for this key is. Large tables with long
  key values get high values.
- `Records`

  How many rows are in the table.
- `M.recordlength`

  The average row length. This is the exact row length for
  tables with fixed-length rows, because all rows have the
  same length.
- `Packed`

  MySQL strips spaces from the end of strings. The
  `Packed` value indicates the percentage of
  savings achieved by doing this.
- `Recordspace used`

  What percentage of the data file is used.
- `Empty space`

  What percentage of the data file is unused.
- `Blocks/Record`

  Average number of blocks per row (that is, how many links a
  fragmented row is composed of). This is always 1.0 for
  fixed-format tables. This value should stay as close to 1.0
  as possible. If it gets too large, you can reorganize the
  table. See [Section 9.6.4, “MyISAM Table Optimization”](myisam-optimization.md "9.6.4 MyISAM Table Optimization").
- `Recordblocks`

  How many blocks (links) are used. For fixed-format tables,
  this is the same as the number of rows.
- `Deleteblocks`

  How many blocks (links) are deleted.
- `Recorddata`

  How many bytes in the data file are used.
- `Deleted data`

  How many bytes in the data file are deleted (unused).
- `Lost space`

  If a row is updated to a shorter length, some space is lost.
  This is the sum of all such losses, in bytes.
- `Linkdata`

  When the dynamic table format is used, row fragments are
  linked with pointers (4 to 7 bytes each).
  `Linkdata` is the sum of the amount of
  storage used by all such pointers.
