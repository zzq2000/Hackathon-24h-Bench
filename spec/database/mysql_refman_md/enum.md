### 13.3.5 The ENUM Type

An `ENUM` is a string object with a value
chosen from a list of permitted values that are enumerated
explicitly in the column specification at table creation time.

See [Section 13.3.1, “String Data Type Syntax”](string-type-syntax.md "13.3.1 String Data Type Syntax") for
[`ENUM`](enum.md "13.3.5 The ENUM Type") type syntax and length
limits.

The [`ENUM`](enum.md "13.3.5 The ENUM Type") type has these
advantages:

- Compact data storage in situations where a column has a
  limited set of possible values. The strings you specify as
  input values are automatically encoded as numbers. See
  [Section 13.7, “Data Type Storage Requirements”](storage-requirements.md "13.7 Data Type Storage Requirements") for storage
  requirements for the `ENUM` type.
- Readable queries and output. The numbers are translated back
  to the corresponding strings in query results.

and these potential issues to consider:

- If you make enumeration values that look like numbers, it is
  easy to mix up the literal values with their internal index
  numbers, as explained in [Enumeration Limitations](enum.md#enum-limits "Enumeration Limitations").
- Using `ENUM` columns in `ORDER
  BY` clauses requires extra care, as explained in
  [Enumeration Sorting](enum.md#enum-sorting "Enumeration Sorting").

#### Creating and Using ENUM Columns

An enumeration value must be a quoted string literal. For
example, you can create a table with an
`ENUM` column like this:

```sql
CREATE TABLE shirts (
    name VARCHAR(40),
    size ENUM('x-small', 'small', 'medium', 'large', 'x-large')
);
INSERT INTO shirts (name, size) VALUES ('dress shirt','large'), ('t-shirt','medium'),
  ('polo shirt','small');
SELECT name, size FROM shirts WHERE size = 'medium';
+---------+--------+
| name    | size   |
+---------+--------+
| t-shirt | medium |
+---------+--------+
UPDATE shirts SET size = 'small' WHERE size = 'large';
COMMIT;
```

Inserting 1 million rows into this table with a value of
`'medium'` would require 1 million bytes of
storage, as opposed to 6 million bytes if you stored the
actual string `'medium'` in a
`VARCHAR` column.

#### Index Values for Enumeration Literals

Each enumeration value has an index:

- The elements listed in the column specification are
  assigned index numbers, beginning with 1.
- The index value of the empty string error value is 0. This
  means that you can use the following
  [`SELECT`](select.md "15.2.13 SELECT Statement") statement to find
  rows into which invalid `ENUM` values
  were assigned:

  ```sql
  mysql> SELECT * FROM tbl_name WHERE enum_col=0;
  ```
- The index of the `NULL` value is
  `NULL`.
- The term “index” here refers to a position
  within the list of enumeration values. It has nothing to
  do with table indexes.

For example, a column specified as `ENUM('Mercury',
'Venus', 'Earth')` can have any of the values shown
here. The index of each value is also shown.

| Value | Index |
| --- | --- |
| `NULL` | `NULL` |
| `''` | 0 |
| `'Mercury'` | 1 |
| `'Venus'` | 2 |
| `'Earth'` | 3 |

An [`ENUM`](enum.md "13.3.5 The ENUM Type") column can have a
maximum of 65,535 distinct elements.

If you retrieve an `ENUM` value in a numeric
context, the column value's index is returned. For example,
you can retrieve numeric values from an
`ENUM` column like this:

```sql
mysql> SELECT enum_col+0 FROM tbl_name;
```

Functions such as [`SUM()`](aggregate-functions.md#function_sum) or
[`AVG()`](aggregate-functions.md#function_avg) that expect a numeric
argument cast the argument to a number if necessary. For
`ENUM` values, the index number is used in
the calculation.

#### Handling of Enumeration Literals

Trailing spaces are automatically deleted from
`ENUM` member values in the table definition
when a table is created.

When retrieved, values stored into an `ENUM`
column are displayed using the lettercase that was used in the
column definition. Note that `ENUM` columns
can be assigned a character set and collation. For binary or
case-sensitive collations, lettercase is taken into account
when assigning values to the column.

If you store a number into an `ENUM` column,
the number is treated as the index into the possible values,
and the value stored is the enumeration member with that
index. (However, this does *not* work with
[`LOAD DATA`](load-data.md "15.2.9 LOAD DATA Statement"), which treats all
input as strings.) If the numeric value is quoted, it is still
interpreted as an index if there is no matching string in the
list of enumeration values. For these reasons, it is not
advisable to define an `ENUM` column with
enumeration values that look like numbers, because this can
easily become confusing. For example, the following column has
enumeration members with string values of
`'0'`, `'1'`, and
`'2'`, but numeric index values of
`1`, `2`, and
`3`:

```sql
numbers ENUM('0','1','2')
```

If you store `2`, it is interpreted as an
index value, and becomes `'1'` (the value
with index 2). If you store `'2'`, it matches
an enumeration value, so it is stored as
`'2'`. If you store `'3'`,
it does not match any enumeration value, so it is treated as
an index and becomes `'2'` (the value with
index 3).

```sql
mysql> INSERT INTO t (numbers) VALUES(2),('2'),('3');
mysql> SELECT * FROM t;
+---------+
| numbers |
+---------+
| 1       |
| 2       |
| 2       |
+---------+
```

To determine all possible values for an
`ENUM` column, use
[`SHOW COLUMNS
FROM tbl_name LIKE
'enum_col'`](show-columns.md "15.7.7.5 SHOW COLUMNS Statement") and parse the
`ENUM` definition in the
`Type` column of the output.

In the C API, `ENUM` values are returned as
strings. For information about using result set metadata to
distinguish them from other strings, see
[C API Basic Data Structures](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/c-api/8.0/en/c-api-data-structures.html).

#### Empty or NULL Enumeration Values

An enumeration value can also be the empty string
(`''`) or `NULL` under
certain circumstances:

- If you insert an invalid value into an
  `ENUM` (that is, a string not present in
  the list of permitted values), the empty string is
  inserted instead as a special error value. This string can
  be distinguished from a “normal” empty string
  by the fact that this string has the numeric value 0. See
  [Index Values for Enumeration Literals](enum.md#enum-indexes "Index Values for Enumeration Literals") for details about the
  numeric indexes for the enumeration values.

  If strict SQL mode is enabled, attempts to insert invalid
  `ENUM` values result in an error.
- If an `ENUM` column is declared to permit
  `NULL`, the `NULL` value
  is a valid value for the column, and the default value is
  `NULL`. If an `ENUM`
  column is declared `NOT NULL`, its
  default value is the first element of the list of
  permitted values.

#### Enumeration Sorting

`ENUM` values are sorted based on their index
numbers, which depend on the order in which the enumeration
members were listed in the column specification. For example,
`'b'` sorts before `'a'` for
`ENUM('b', 'a')`. The empty string sorts
before nonempty strings, and `NULL` values
sort before all other enumeration values.

To prevent unexpected results when using the `ORDER
BY` clause on an `ENUM` column, use
one of these techniques:

- Specify the `ENUM` list in alphabetic
  order.
- Make sure that the column is sorted lexically rather than
  by index number by coding `ORDER BY
  CAST(col AS CHAR)` or
  `ORDER BY
  CONCAT(col)`.

#### Enumeration Limitations

An enumeration value cannot be an expression, even one that
evaluates to a string value.

For example, this [`CREATE TABLE`](create-table.md "15.1.20 CREATE TABLE Statement")
statement does *not* work because the
`CONCAT` function cannot be used to construct
an enumeration value:

```sql
CREATE TABLE sizes (
    size ENUM('small', CONCAT('med','ium'), 'large')
);
```

You also cannot employ a user variable as an enumeration
value. This pair of statements do *not*
work:

```sql
SET @mysize = 'medium';

CREATE TABLE sizes (
    size ENUM('small', @mysize, 'large')
);
```

We strongly recommend that you do *not* use
numbers as enumeration values, because it does not save on
storage over the appropriate
[`TINYINT`](integer-types.md "13.1.2 Integer Types (Exact Value) - INTEGER, INT, SMALLINT, TINYINT, MEDIUMINT, BIGINT") or
[`SMALLINT`](integer-types.md "13.1.2 Integer Types (Exact Value) - INTEGER, INT, SMALLINT, TINYINT, MEDIUMINT, BIGINT") type, and it is easy
to mix up the strings and the underlying number values (which
might not be the same) if you quote the
`ENUM` values incorrectly. If you do use a
number as an enumeration value, always enclose it in quotation
marks. If the quotation marks are omitted, the number is
regarded as an index. See [Handling of Enumeration Literals](enum.md#enum-literals "Handling of Enumeration Literals") to
see how even a quoted number could be mistakenly used as a
numeric index value.

Duplicate values in the definition cause a warning, or an
error if strict SQL mode is enabled.
