This section explains how to upgrade a Group Replication setup. The
basic process of upgrading members of a group is the same as
upgrading stand-alone instances, see [Chapter 3, *Upgrading MySQL*](upgrading.md "Chapter 3 Upgrading MySQL") for
the actual process of doing upgrade and types available. Choosing
between an in-place or logical upgrade depends on the amount of data
stored in the group. Usually an in-place upgrade is faster, and
therefore is recommended. You should also consult
[Section 19.5.3, “Upgrading a Replication Topology”](replication-upgrade.md "19.5.3 Upgrading a Replication Topology").

While you are in the process of upgrading an online group, in order
to maximize availability, you might need to have members with
different MySQL Server versions running at the same time. Group
Replication includes compatibility policies that enable you to
safely combine members running different versions of MySQL in the
same group during the upgrade procedure. Depending on your group,
the effects of these policies might affect the order in which you
should upgrade group members. For details, see
[Section 20.8.1, “Combining Different Member Versions in a Group”](group-replication-online-upgrade-combining-versions.md "20.8.1 Combining Different Member Versions in a Group").

If your group can be taken fully offline see
[Section 20.8.2, “Group Replication Offline Upgrade”](group-replication-offline-upgrade.md "20.8.2 Group Replication Offline Upgrade"). If your group
needs to remain online, as is common with production deployments,
see [Section 20.8.3, “Group Replication Online Upgrade”](group-replication-online-upgrade.md "20.8.3 Group Replication Online Upgrade") for the
different approaches available for upgrading a group with minimal
downtime.
