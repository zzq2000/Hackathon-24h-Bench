### 25.6.6 NDB Cluster Single User Mode

Single user mode enables the
database administrator to restrict access to the database system
to a single API node, such as a MySQL server (SQL node) or an
instance of [**ndb\_restore**](mysql-cluster-programs-ndb-restore.md "25.5.23 ndb_restore — Restore an NDB Cluster Backup"). When entering single
user mode, connections to all other API nodes are closed
gracefully and all running transactions are aborted. No new
transactions are permitted to start.

Once the cluster has entered single user mode, only the designated
API node is granted access to the database.

You can use the `ALL STATUS` command in the
[**ndb\_mgm**](mysql-cluster-programs-ndb-mgm.md "25.5.5 ndb_mgm — The NDB Cluster Management Client") client to see when the cluster has
entered single user mode. You can also check the
`status` column of the
[`ndbinfo.nodes`](mysql-cluster-ndbinfo-nodes.md "25.6.16.47 The ndbinfo nodes Table") table (see
[Section 25.6.16.47, “The ndbinfo nodes Table”](mysql-cluster-ndbinfo-nodes.md "25.6.16.47 The ndbinfo nodes Table"), for more
information).

Example:

```ndbmgm
ndb_mgm> ENTER SINGLE USER MODE 5
```

After this command has executed and the cluster has entered single
user mode, the API node whose node ID is `5`
becomes the cluster's only permitted user.

The node specified in the preceding command must be an API node;
attempting to specify any other type of node is rejected.

Note

When the preceding command is invoked, all transactions running
on the designated node are aborted, the connection is closed,
and the server must be restarted.

The command `EXIT SINGLE USER MODE` changes the
state of the cluster's data nodes from single user mode to
normal mode. API nodes—such as MySQL Servers—waiting
for a connection (that is, waiting for the cluster to become ready
and available), are again permitted to connect. The API node
denoted as the single-user node continues to run (if still
connected) during and after the state change.

Example:

```ndbmgm
ndb_mgm> EXIT SINGLE USER MODE
```

There are two recommended ways to handle a node failure when
running in single user mode:

- Method 1:

  1. Finish all single user mode transactions
  2. Issue the `EXIT SINGLE USER MODE` command
  3. Restart the cluster's data nodes
- Method 2:

  Restart storage nodes prior to entering single user mode.
