#### 17.7.2.3 Consistent Nonlocking Reads

A [consistent read](glossary.md#glos_consistent_read "consistent read")
means that `InnoDB` uses multi-versioning to
present to a query a snapshot of the database at a point in
time. The query sees the changes made by transactions that
committed before that point in time, and no changes made by
later or uncommitted transactions. The exception to this rule is
that the query sees the changes made by earlier statements
within the same transaction. This exception causes the following
anomaly: If you update some rows in a table, a
[`SELECT`](select.md "15.2.13 SELECT Statement") sees the latest version of
the updated rows, but it might also see older versions of any
rows. If other sessions simultaneously update the same table,
the anomaly means that you might see the table in a state that
never existed in the database.

If the transaction
[isolation level](glossary.md#glos_isolation_level "isolation level") is
[`REPEATABLE READ`](innodb-transaction-isolation-levels.md#isolevel_repeatable-read) (the default
level), all consistent reads within the same transaction read
the snapshot established by the first such read in that
transaction. You can get a fresher snapshot for your queries by
committing the current transaction and after that issuing new
queries.

With [`READ COMMITTED`](innodb-transaction-isolation-levels.md#isolevel_read-committed) isolation
level, each consistent read within a transaction sets and reads
its own fresh snapshot.

Consistent read is the default mode in which
`InnoDB` processes
[`SELECT`](select.md "15.2.13 SELECT Statement") statements in
[`READ COMMITTED`](innodb-transaction-isolation-levels.md#isolevel_read-committed) and
[`REPEATABLE READ`](innodb-transaction-isolation-levels.md#isolevel_repeatable-read) isolation
levels. A consistent read does not set any locks on the tables
it accesses, and therefore other sessions are free to modify
those tables at the same time a consistent read is being
performed on the table.

Suppose that you are running in the default
[`REPEATABLE READ`](innodb-transaction-isolation-levels.md#isolevel_repeatable-read) isolation
level. When you issue a consistent read (that is, an ordinary
[`SELECT`](select.md "15.2.13 SELECT Statement") statement),
`InnoDB` gives your transaction a timepoint
according to which your query sees the database. If another
transaction deletes a row and commits after your timepoint was
assigned, you do not see the row as having been deleted. Inserts
and updates are treated similarly.

Note

The snapshot of the database state applies to
[`SELECT`](select.md "15.2.13 SELECT Statement") statements within a
transaction, not necessarily to
[DML](glossary.md#glos_dml "DML") statements. If you insert
or modify some rows and then commit that transaction, a
[`DELETE`](delete.md "15.2.2 DELETE Statement") or
[`UPDATE`](update.md "15.2.17 UPDATE Statement") statement issued from
another concurrent `REPEATABLE READ`
transaction could affect those just-committed rows, even
though the session could not query them. If a transaction does
update or delete rows committed by a different transaction,
those changes do become visible to the current transaction.
For example, you might encounter a situation like the
following:

```sql
SELECT COUNT(c1) FROM t1 WHERE c1 = 'xyz';
-- Returns 0: no rows match.
DELETE FROM t1 WHERE c1 = 'xyz';
-- Deletes several rows recently committed by other transaction.

SELECT COUNT(c2) FROM t1 WHERE c2 = 'abc';
-- Returns 0: no rows match.
UPDATE t1 SET c2 = 'cba' WHERE c2 = 'abc';
-- Affects 10 rows: another txn just committed 10 rows with 'abc' values.
SELECT COUNT(c2) FROM t1 WHERE c2 = 'cba';
-- Returns 10: this txn can now see the rows it just updated.
```

You can advance your timepoint by committing your transaction
and then doing another [`SELECT`](select.md "15.2.13 SELECT Statement") or
[`START TRANSACTION WITH
CONSISTENT SNAPSHOT`](commit.md "15.3.1 START TRANSACTION, COMMIT, and ROLLBACK Statements").

This is called multi-versioned
concurrency control.

In the following example, session A sees the row inserted by B
only when B has committed the insert and A has committed as
well, so that the timepoint is advanced past the commit of B.

```sql
             Session A              Session B

           SET autocommit=0;      SET autocommit=0;
time
|          SELECT * FROM t;
|          empty set
|                                 INSERT INTO t VALUES (1, 2);
|
v          SELECT * FROM t;
           empty set
                                  COMMIT;

           SELECT * FROM t;
           empty set

           COMMIT;

           SELECT * FROM t;
           ---------------------
           |    1    |    2    |
           ---------------------
```

If you want to see the “freshest” state of the
database, use either the [`READ
COMMITTED`](innodb-transaction-isolation-levels.md#isolevel_read-committed) isolation level or a
[locking read](glossary.md#glos_locking_read "locking read"):

```sql
SELECT * FROM t FOR SHARE;
```

With [`READ COMMITTED`](innodb-transaction-isolation-levels.md#isolevel_read-committed) isolation
level, each consistent read within a transaction sets and reads
its own fresh snapshot. With `FOR SHARE`, a
locking read occurs instead: A `SELECT` blocks
until the transaction containing the freshest rows ends (see
[Section 17.7.2.4, “Locking Reads”](innodb-locking-reads.md "17.7.2.4 Locking Reads")).

Consistent read does not work over certain DDL statements:

- Consistent read does not work over [`DROP
  TABLE`](drop-table.md "15.1.32 DROP TABLE Statement"), because MySQL cannot use a table that has
  been dropped and `InnoDB` destroys the
  table.
- Consistent read does not work over
  [`ALTER TABLE`](alter-table.md "15.1.9 ALTER TABLE Statement") operations that
  make a temporary copy of the original table and delete the
  original table when the temporary copy is built. When you
  reissue a consistent read within a transaction, rows in the
  new table are not visible because those rows did not exist
  when the transaction's snapshot was taken. In this case, the
  transaction returns an error:
  [`ER_TABLE_DEF_CHANGED`](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/mysql-errors/8.0/en/server-error-reference.html#error_er_table_def_changed),
  “Table definition has changed, please retry
  transaction”.

The type of read varies for selects in clauses like
[`INSERT INTO ...
SELECT`](insert.md "15.2.7 INSERT Statement"), [`UPDATE
... (SELECT)`](update.md "15.2.17 UPDATE Statement"), and
[`CREATE TABLE ...
SELECT`](create-table.md "15.1.20 CREATE TABLE Statement") that do not specify `FOR
UPDATE` or `FOR SHARE`:

- By default, `InnoDB` uses stronger locks
  for those statements and the
  [`SELECT`](select.md "15.2.13 SELECT Statement") part acts like
  [`READ COMMITTED`](innodb-transaction-isolation-levels.md#isolevel_read-committed), where
  each consistent read, even within the same transaction, sets
  and reads its own fresh snapshot.
- To perform a nonlocking read in such cases, set the
  isolation level of the transaction to
  [`READ UNCOMMITTED`](innodb-transaction-isolation-levels.md#isolevel_read-uncommitted) or
  [`READ COMMITTED`](innodb-transaction-isolation-levels.md#isolevel_read-committed) to avoid
  setting locks on rows read from the selected table.
