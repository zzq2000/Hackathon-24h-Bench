### 12.8.1 Using COLLATE in SQL Statements

With the `COLLATE` clause, you can override
whatever the default collation is for a comparison.
`COLLATE` may be used in various parts of SQL
statements. Here are some examples:

- With `ORDER BY`:

  ```sql
  SELECT k
  FROM t1
  ORDER BY k COLLATE latin1_german2_ci;
  ```
- With `AS`:

  ```sql
  SELECT k COLLATE latin1_german2_ci AS k1
  FROM t1
  ORDER BY k1;
  ```
- With `GROUP BY`:

  ```sql
  SELECT k
  FROM t1
  GROUP BY k COLLATE latin1_german2_ci;
  ```
- With aggregate functions:

  ```sql
  SELECT MAX(k COLLATE latin1_german2_ci)
  FROM t1;
  ```
- With `DISTINCT`:

  ```sql
  SELECT DISTINCT k COLLATE latin1_german2_ci
  FROM t1;
  ```
- With `WHERE`:

  ```sql
  SELECT *
  FROM t1
  WHERE _latin1 'Müller' COLLATE latin1_german2_ci = k;
  ```

  ```sql
  SELECT *
  FROM t1
  WHERE k LIKE _latin1 'Müller' COLLATE latin1_german2_ci;
  ```
- With `HAVING`:

  ```sql
  SELECT k
  FROM t1
  GROUP BY k
  HAVING k = _latin1 'Müller' COLLATE latin1_german2_ci;
  ```
