#### 29.12.16.1 The tp\_thread\_group\_state Table

Note

The Performance Schema table described here is available as
of MySQL 8.0.14. Prior to MySQL 8.0.14, use the
corresponding `INFORMATION_SCHEMA` table
instead; see
[Section 28.5.2, “The INFORMATION\_SCHEMA TP\_THREAD\_GROUP\_STATE Table”](information-schema-tp-thread-group-state-table.md "28.5.2 The INFORMATION_SCHEMA TP_THREAD_GROUP_STATE Table").

The [`tp_thread_group_state`](performance-schema-tp-thread-group-state-table.md "29.12.16.1 The tp_thread_group_state Table") table
has one row per thread group in the thread pool. Each row
provides information about the current state of a group.

The [`tp_thread_group_state`](performance-schema-tp-thread-group-state-table.md "29.12.16.1 The tp_thread_group_state Table") table
has these columns:

- `TP_GROUP_ID`

  The thread group ID. This is a unique key within the
  table.
- `CONSUMER THREADS`

  The number of consumer threads. There is at most one
  thread ready to start executing if the active threads
  become stalled or blocked.
- `RESERVE_THREADS`

  The number of threads in the reserved state. This means
  that they are not started until there is a need to wake a
  new thread and there is no consumer thread. This is where
  most threads end up when the thread group has created more
  threads than needed for normal operation. Often a thread
  group needs additional threads for a short while and then
  does not need them again for a while. In this case, they
  go into the reserved state and remain until needed again.
  They take up some extra memory resources, but no extra
  computing resources.
- `CONNECT_THREAD_COUNT`

  The number of threads that are processing or waiting to
  process connection initialization and authentication.
  There can be a maximum of four connection threads per
  thread group; these threads expire after a period of
  inactivity.
- `CONNECTION_COUNT`

  The number of connections using this thread group.
- `QUEUED_QUERIES`

  The number of statements waiting in the high-priority
  queue.
- `QUEUED_TRANSACTIONS`

  The number of statements waiting in the low-priority
  queue. These are the initial statements for transactions
  that have not started, so they also represent queued
  transactions.
- `STALL_LIMIT`

  The value of the
  [`thread_pool_stall_limit`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_thread_pool_stall_limit)
  system variable for the thread group. This is the same
  value for all thread groups.
- `PRIO_KICKUP_TIMER`

  The value of the
  [`thread_pool_prio_kickup_timer`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_thread_pool_prio_kickup_timer)
  system variable for the thread group. This is the same
  value for all thread groups.
- `ALGORITHM`

  The value of the
  [`thread_pool_algorithm`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_thread_pool_algorithm)
  system variable for the thread group. This is the same
  value for all thread groups.
- `THREAD_COUNT`

  The number of threads started in the thread pool as part
  of this thread group.
- `ACTIVE_THREAD_COUNT`

  The number of threads active in executing statements.
- `STALLED_THREAD_COUNT`

  The number of stalled statements in the thread group. A
  stalled statement could be executing, but from a thread
  pool perspective it is stalled and making no progress. A
  long-running statement quickly ends up in this category.
- `WAITING_THREAD_NUMBER`

  If there is a thread handling the polling of statements in
  the thread group, this specifies the thread number within
  this thread group. It is possible that this thread could
  be executing a statement.
- `OLDEST_QUEUED`

  How long in milliseconds the oldest queued statement has
  been waiting for execution.
- `MAX_THREAD_IDS_IN_GROUP`

  The maximum thread ID of the threads in the group. This is
  the same as
  [`MAX(TP_THREAD_NUMBER)`](aggregate-functions.md#function_max) for
  the threads when selected from the
  [`tp_thread_state`](performance-schema-tp-thread-state-table.md "29.12.16.3 The tp_thread_state Table") table. That
  is, these two queries are equivalent:

  ```sql
  SELECT TP_GROUP_ID, MAX_THREAD_IDS_IN_GROUP
  FROM tp_thread_group_state;

  SELECT TP_GROUP_ID, MAX(TP_THREAD_NUMBER)
  FROM tp_thread_state GROUP BY TP_GROUP_ID;
  ```

The [`tp_thread_group_state`](performance-schema-tp-thread-group-state-table.md "29.12.16.1 The tp_thread_group_state Table") table
has these indexes:

- Unique index on (`TP_GROUP_ID`)

[`TRUNCATE TABLE`](truncate-table.md "15.1.37 TRUNCATE TABLE Statement") is not permitted
for the [`tp_thread_group_state`](performance-schema-tp-thread-group-state-table.md "29.12.16.1 The tp_thread_group_state Table")
table.
