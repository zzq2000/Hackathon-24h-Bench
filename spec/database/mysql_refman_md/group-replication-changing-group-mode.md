#### 20.5.1.2 Changing the Group Mode

This section explains how to change the mode which a group is
running in, either single or multi-primary. The functions used
to change a group's mode can be run on any member.

##### Changing to Single-Primary Mode

Use the
[`group_replication_switch_to_single_primary_mode()`](group-replication-functions-for-mode.md#function_group-replication-switch-to-single-primary-mode)
function to change a group running in multi-primary mode to
single-primary mode by issuing:

```sql
SELECT group_replication_switch_to_single_primary_mode()
```

When you change to single-primary mode, strict consistency
checks are also disabled on all group members, as required in
single-primary mode
([`group_replication_enforce_update_everywhere_checks=OFF`](group-replication-system-variables.md#sysvar_group_replication_enforce_update_everywhere_checks)).

If no string is passed in, the election of the new primary in
the resulting single-primary group follows the election
policies described in
[Section 20.1.3.1, “Single-Primary Mode”](group-replication-single-primary-mode.md "20.1.3.1 Single-Primary Mode"). To
override the election process and configure a specific member
of the multi-primary group as the new primary in the process,
get the [`server_uuid`](replication-options.md#sysvar_server_uuid) of the
member and pass it to [`group_replication_switch_to_single_primary_mode()`](group-replication-functions-for-mode.md#function_group-replication-switch-to-single-primary-mode).
For example, issue:

```sql
SELECT group_replication_switch_to_single_primary_mode(member_uuid);
```

If you invoke the function on a member running a MySQL Server
version from 8.0.17, and all members are running MySQL Server
version 8.0.17 or higher, you can only specify a new primary
member that is running the lowest MySQL Server version in the
group, based on the patch version. This safeguard is applied
to ensure the group maintains compatibility with new
functions. If you do not specify a new primary member, the
election process considers the patch version of the group
members.

If any member is running a MySQL Server version between MySQL
8.0.13 and MySQL 8.0.16, this safeguard is not enforced for
the group and you can specify any new primary member, but it
is recommended to select a primary that is running the lowest
MySQL Server version in the group. If you do not specify a new
primary member, the election process considers only the major
version of the group members.

While the action runs, you can check its progress by issuing:

```sql
SELECT event_name, work_completed, work_estimated FROM performance_schema.events_stages_current WHERE event_name LIKE "%stage/group_rpl%";
+----------------------------------------------------------------------------+----------------+----------------+
| event_name                                                                 | work_completed | work_estimated |
+----------------------------------------------------------------------------+----------------+----------------+
| stage/group_rpl/Primary Switch: waiting for pending transactions to finish |              4 |             20 |
+----------------------------------------------------------------------------+----------------+----------------+
```

##### Changing to Multi-Primary Mode

Use the
[`group_replication_switch_to_multi_primary_mode()`](group-replication-functions-for-mode.md#function_group-replication-switch-to-multi-primary-mode)
function to change a group running in single-primary mode to
multi-primary mode by issuing:

```sql
SELECT group_replication_switch_to_multi_primary_mode()
```

After some coordinated group operations to ensure the safety
and consistency of your data, all members which belong to the
group become primaries.

When you change a group that was running in single-primary
mode to run in multi-primary mode, members running MySQL
8.0.17 or higher are automatically placed in read-only mode if
they are running a higher MySQL server version than the lowest
version present in the group. Members running MySQL 8.0.16 or
lower do not carry out this check, and are always placed in
read-write mode.

While the action runs, you can check its progress by issuing:

```sql
SELECT event_name, work_completed, work_estimated FROM performance_schema.events_stages_current WHERE event_name LIKE "%stage/group_rpl%";
+----------------------------------------------------------------------+----------------+----------------+
| event_name                                                           | work_completed | work_estimated |
+----------------------------------------------------------------------+----------------+----------------+
| stage/group_rpl/Multi-primary Switch: applying buffered transactions |              0 |              1 |
+----------------------------------------------------------------------+----------------+----------------+
```
