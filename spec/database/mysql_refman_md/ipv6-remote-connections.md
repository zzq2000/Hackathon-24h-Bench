#### 7.1.13.4 Connecting Using IPv6 Nonlocal Host Addresses

The following procedure shows how to configure MySQL to permit
IPv6 connections by remote clients. It is similar to the
preceding procedure for local clients, but the server and client
hosts are distinct and each has its own nonlocal IPv6 address.
The example uses these addresses:

```simple
Server host: 2001:db8:0:f101::1
Client host: 2001:db8:0:f101::2
```

These addresses are chosen from the nonroutable address range
recommended by
[IANA](http://www.iana.org/assignments/ipv6-unicast-address-assignments/ipv6-unicast-address-assignments.xml)
for documentation purposes and suffice for testing on your local
network. To accept IPv6 connections from clients outside the
local network, the server host must have a public address. If
your network provider assigns you an IPv6 address, you can use
that. Otherwise, another way to obtain an address is to use an
IPv6 broker; see [Section 7.1.13.5, “Obtaining an IPv6 Address from a Broker”](ipv6-brokers.md "7.1.13.5 Obtaining an IPv6 Address from a Broker").

1. Start the MySQL server with an appropriate
   [`bind_address`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_bind_address) setting to
   permit it to accept IPv6 connections. For example, put the
   following lines in the server option file and restart the
   server:

   ```ini
   [mysqld]
   bind_address = *
   ```

   Specifying \* (or `::`) as the value for
   [`bind_address`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_bind_address) permits both
   IPv4 and IPv6 connections on all server host IPv4 and IPv6
   interfaces. If you want to bind the server to a specific
   list of addresses, you can do this as of MySQL 8.0.13 by
   specifying a comma-separated list of values for
   [`bind_address`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_bind_address). This example
   specifies an IPv4 address as well as the required server
   host IPv6 address:

   ```ini
   [mysqld]
   bind_address = 198.51.100.20,2001:db8:0:f101::1
   ```

   For more information, see the
   [`bind_address`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_bind_address) description in
   [Section 7.1.8, “Server System Variables”](server-system-variables.md "7.1.8 Server System Variables").
2. On the server host (`2001:db8:0:f101::1`),
   create an account for a user who can connect from the client
   host (`2001:db8:0:f101::2`):

   ```sql
   mysql> CREATE USER 'remoteipv6user'@'2001:db8:0:f101::2' IDENTIFIED BY 'remoteipv6pass';
   ```
3. On the client host (`2001:db8:0:f101::2`),
   invoke the [**mysql**](mysql.md "6.5.1 mysql — The MySQL Command-Line Client") client to connect to the
   server using the new account:

   ```terminal
   $> mysql -h 2001:db8:0:f101::1 -u remoteipv6user -premoteipv6pass
   ```
4. Try some simple statements that show connection information:

   ```sql
   mysql> STATUS
   ...
   Connection:   2001:db8:0:f101::1 via TCP/IP
   ...

   mysql> SELECT CURRENT_USER(), @@bind_address;
   +-----------------------------------+----------------+
   | CURRENT_USER()                    | @@bind_address |
   +-----------------------------------+----------------+
   | remoteipv6user@2001:db8:0:f101::2 | ::             |
   +-----------------------------------+----------------+
   ```
