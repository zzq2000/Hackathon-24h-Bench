#### 25.3.2.2 Compiling and Installing NDB Cluster from Source on Windows

Oracle provides precompiled NDB Cluster binaries for Windows
which should be adequate for most users. However, if you wish,
it is also possible to compile NDB Cluster for Windows from
source code. The procedure for doing this is almost identical to
the procedure used to compile the standard MySQL Server binaries
for Windows, and uses the same tools. However, there are two
major differences:

- Building MySQL NDB Cluster 8.0 requires using the MySQL
  Server 8.0 sources. These are available from the MySQL
  downloads page at <https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/>. The
  archived source file should have a name similar to
  `mysql-8.0.43.tar.gz`.
  You can also obtain the sources from GitHub at
  <https://github.com/mysql/mysql-server>.
- You must configure the build using the
  [`WITH_NDB`](source-configuration-options.md#option_cmake_with_ndb) option in addition to
  any other build options you wish to use with
  **CMake**.
  [`WITH_NDBCLUSTER`](source-configuration-options.md#option_cmake_with_ndbcluster) is also
  supported for backwards compatibility, but is deprecated as
  of NDB 8.0.31.

Important

The [`WITH_NDB_JAVA`](source-configuration-options.md#option_cmake_with_ndb_java) option is
enabled by default. This means that, by default, if
**CMake** cannot find the location of Java on
your system, the configuration process fails; if you do not
wish to enable Java and ClusterJ support, you must indicate
this explicitly by configuring the build using
`-DWITH_NDB_JAVA=OFF`. (Bug #12379735) Use
[`WITH_CLASSPATH`](source-configuration-options.md#option_cmake_with_classpath) to provide the
Java classpath if needed.

For more information about **CMake** options
specific to building NDB Cluster, see
[CMake Options for Compiling NDB Cluster](source-configuration-options.md#cmake-mysql-cluster-options "CMake Options for Compiling NDB Cluster").

Once the build process is complete, you can create a Zip archive
containing the compiled binaries;
[Section 2.8.4, “Installing MySQL Using a Standard Source Distribution”](installing-source-distribution.md "2.8.4 Installing MySQL Using a Standard Source Distribution") provides the
commands needed to perform this task on Windows systems. The NDB
Cluster binaries can be found in the `bin`
directory of the resulting archive, which is equivalent to the
`no-install` archive, and which can be
installed and configured in the same manner. For more
information, see
[Section 25.3.2.1, “Installing NDB Cluster on Windows from a Binary Release”](mysql-cluster-install-windows-binary.md "25.3.2.1 Installing NDB Cluster on Windows from a Binary Release").
