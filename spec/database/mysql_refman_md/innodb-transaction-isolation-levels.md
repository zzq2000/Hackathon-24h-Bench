#### 17.7.2.1 Transaction Isolation Levels

Transaction isolation is one of the foundations of database
processing. Isolation is the I in the acronym
[ACID](glossary.md#glos_acid "ACID"); the isolation level is
the setting that fine-tunes the balance between performance and
reliability, consistency, and reproducibility of results when
multiple transactions are making changes and performing queries
at the same time.

`InnoDB` offers all four transaction isolation
levels described by the SQL:1992 standard:
[`READ UNCOMMITTED`](innodb-transaction-isolation-levels.md#isolevel_read-uncommitted),
[`READ COMMITTED`](innodb-transaction-isolation-levels.md#isolevel_read-committed),
[`REPEATABLE READ`](innodb-transaction-isolation-levels.md#isolevel_repeatable-read), and
[`SERIALIZABLE`](innodb-transaction-isolation-levels.md#isolevel_serializable). The default
isolation level for `InnoDB` is
[`REPEATABLE READ`](innodb-transaction-isolation-levels.md#isolevel_repeatable-read).

A user can change the isolation level for a single session or
for all subsequent connections with the [`SET
TRANSACTION`](set-transaction.md "15.3.7 SET TRANSACTION Statement") statement. To set the server's default
isolation level for all connections, use the
[`--transaction-isolation`](server-options.md#option_mysqld_transaction-isolation) option on
the command line or in an option file. For detailed information
about isolation levels and level-setting syntax, see
[Section 15.3.7, “SET TRANSACTION Statement”](set-transaction.md "15.3.7 SET TRANSACTION Statement").

`InnoDB` supports each of the transaction
isolation levels described here using different
[locking](glossary.md#glos_locking "locking") strategies. You can
enforce a high degree of consistency with the default
[`REPEATABLE READ`](innodb-transaction-isolation-levels.md#isolevel_repeatable-read) level, for
operations on crucial data where
[ACID](glossary.md#glos_acid "ACID") compliance is important.
Or you can relax the consistency rules with
[`READ COMMITTED`](innodb-transaction-isolation-levels.md#isolevel_read-committed) or even
[`READ UNCOMMITTED`](innodb-transaction-isolation-levels.md#isolevel_read-uncommitted), in
situations such as bulk reporting where precise consistency and
repeatable results are less important than minimizing the amount
of overhead for locking.
[`SERIALIZABLE`](innodb-transaction-isolation-levels.md#isolevel_serializable) enforces even
stricter rules than [`REPEATABLE
READ`](innodb-transaction-isolation-levels.md#isolevel_repeatable-read), and is used mainly in specialized situations,
such as with [XA](glossary.md#glos_xa "XA") transactions and
for troubleshooting issues with concurrency and
[deadlocks](glossary.md#glos_deadlock "deadlock").

The following list describes how MySQL supports the different
transaction levels. The list goes from the most commonly used
level to the least used.

- `REPEATABLE READ`

  This is the default isolation level for
  `InnoDB`.
  [Consistent reads](glossary.md#glos_consistent_read "consistent read")
  within the same transaction read the
  [snapshot](glossary.md#glos_snapshot "snapshot") established by
  the first read. This means that if you issue several plain
  (nonlocking) [`SELECT`](select.md "15.2.13 SELECT Statement")
  statements within the same transaction, these
  [`SELECT`](select.md "15.2.13 SELECT Statement") statements are
  consistent also with respect to each other. See
  [Section 17.7.2.3, “Consistent Nonlocking Reads”](innodb-consistent-read.md "17.7.2.3 Consistent Nonlocking Reads").

  For [locking reads](glossary.md#glos_locking_read "locking read")
  ([`SELECT`](select.md "15.2.13 SELECT Statement") with `FOR
  UPDATE` or `FOR SHARE`),
  [`UPDATE`](update.md "15.2.17 UPDATE Statement"), and
  [`DELETE`](delete.md "15.2.2 DELETE Statement") statements, locking
  depends on whether the statement uses a unique index with a
  unique search condition, or a range-type search condition.

  - For a unique index with a unique search condition,
    `InnoDB` locks only the index record
    found, not the [gap](glossary.md#glos_gap "gap")
    before it.
  - For other search conditions, `InnoDB`
    locks the index range scanned, using
    [gap locks](glossary.md#glos_gap_lock "gap lock") or
    [next-key locks](glossary.md#glos_next_key_lock "next-key lock")
    to block insertions by other sessions into the gaps
    covered by the range. For information about gap locks
    and next-key locks, see
    [Section 17.7.1, “InnoDB Locking”](innodb-locking.md "17.7.1 InnoDB Locking").

  It is not recommended to mix locking statements
  ([`UPDATE`](update.md "15.2.17 UPDATE Statement"),
  [`INSERT`](insert.md "15.2.7 INSERT Statement"),
  [`DELETE`](delete.md "15.2.2 DELETE Statement"), or `SELECT
  ... FOR ...`) with non-locking
  [`SELECT`](select.md "15.2.13 SELECT Statement") statements in a single
  [`REPEATABLE READ`](innodb-transaction-isolation-levels.md#isolevel_repeatable-read)
  transaction, because typically in such cases you want
  [`SERIALIZABLE`](innodb-transaction-isolation-levels.md#isolevel_serializable). This is
  because a non-locking [`SELECT`](select.md "15.2.13 SELECT Statement")
  statement presents the state of the database from a read
  view which consists of transactions committed before the
  read view was created, and before the current transaction's
  own writes, while the locking statements use the most recent
  state of the database to use locking. In general, these two
  different table states are inconsistent with each other and
  difficult to parse.
- `READ COMMITTED`

  Each consistent read, even within the same transaction, sets
  and reads its own fresh snapshot. For information about
  consistent reads, see
  [Section 17.7.2.3, “Consistent Nonlocking Reads”](innodb-consistent-read.md "17.7.2.3 Consistent Nonlocking Reads").

  For locking reads ([`SELECT`](select.md "15.2.13 SELECT Statement")
  with `FOR UPDATE` or `FOR
  SHARE`), [`UPDATE`](update.md "15.2.17 UPDATE Statement")
  statements, and [`DELETE`](delete.md "15.2.2 DELETE Statement")
  statements, `InnoDB` locks only index
  records, not the gaps before them, and thus permits the free
  insertion of new records next to locked records. Gap locking
  is only used for foreign-key constraint checking and
  duplicate-key checking.

  Because gap locking is disabled, phantom row problems may
  occur, as other sessions can insert new rows into the gaps.
  For information about phantom rows, see
  [Section 17.7.4, “Phantom Rows”](innodb-next-key-locking.md "17.7.4 Phantom Rows").

  Only row-based binary logging is supported with the
  `READ COMMITTED` isolation level. If you
  use `READ COMMITTED` with
  [`binlog_format=MIXED`](replication-options-binary-log.md#sysvar_binlog_format), the
  server automatically uses row-based logging.

  Using `READ COMMITTED` has additional
  effects:

  - For [`UPDATE`](update.md "15.2.17 UPDATE Statement") or
    [`DELETE`](delete.md "15.2.2 DELETE Statement") statements,
    `InnoDB` holds locks only for rows that
    it updates or deletes. Record locks for nonmatching rows
    are released after MySQL has evaluated the
    `WHERE` condition. This greatly reduces
    the probability of deadlocks, but they can still happen.
  - For [`UPDATE`](update.md "15.2.17 UPDATE Statement") statements, if
    a row is already locked, `InnoDB`
    performs a “semi-consistent” read,
    returning the latest committed version to MySQL so that
    MySQL can determine whether the row matches the
    `WHERE` condition of the
    [`UPDATE`](update.md "15.2.17 UPDATE Statement"). If the row
    matches (must be updated), MySQL reads the row again and
    this time `InnoDB` either locks it or
    waits for a lock on it.

  Consider the following example, beginning with this table:

  ```sql
  CREATE TABLE t (a INT NOT NULL, b INT) ENGINE = InnoDB;
  INSERT INTO t VALUES (1,2),(2,3),(3,2),(4,3),(5,2);
  COMMIT;
  ```

  In this case, the table has no indexes, so searches and
  index scans use the hidden clustered index for record
  locking (see [Section 17.6.2.1, “Clustered and Secondary Indexes”](innodb-index-types.md "17.6.2.1 Clustered and Secondary Indexes")) rather
  than indexed columns.

  Suppose that one session performs an
  [`UPDATE`](update.md "15.2.17 UPDATE Statement") using these
  statements:

  ```sql
  # Session A
  START TRANSACTION;
  UPDATE t SET b = 5 WHERE b = 3;
  ```

  Suppose also that a second session performs an
  [`UPDATE`](update.md "15.2.17 UPDATE Statement") by executing these
  statements following those of the first session:

  ```sql
  # Session B
  UPDATE t SET b = 4 WHERE b = 2;
  ```

  As [`InnoDB`](innodb-storage-engine.md "Chapter 17 The InnoDB Storage Engine") executes each
  [`UPDATE`](update.md "15.2.17 UPDATE Statement"), it first acquires an
  exclusive lock for each row, and then determines whether to
  modify it. If [`InnoDB`](innodb-storage-engine.md "Chapter 17 The InnoDB Storage Engine") does not
  modify the row, it releases the lock. Otherwise,
  [`InnoDB`](innodb-storage-engine.md "Chapter 17 The InnoDB Storage Engine") retains the lock until
  the end of the transaction. This affects transaction
  processing as follows.

  When using the default `REPEATABLE READ`
  isolation level, the first
  [`UPDATE`](update.md "15.2.17 UPDATE Statement") acquires an x-lock on
  each row that it reads and does not release any of them:

  ```none
  x-lock(1,2); retain x-lock
  x-lock(2,3); update(2,3) to (2,5); retain x-lock
  x-lock(3,2); retain x-lock
  x-lock(4,3); update(4,3) to (4,5); retain x-lock
  x-lock(5,2); retain x-lock
  ```

  The second [`UPDATE`](update.md "15.2.17 UPDATE Statement") blocks as
  soon as it tries to acquire any locks (because first update
  has retained locks on all rows), and does not proceed until
  the first [`UPDATE`](update.md "15.2.17 UPDATE Statement") commits or
  rolls back:

  ```none
  x-lock(1,2); block and wait for first UPDATE to commit or roll back
  ```

  If `READ COMMITTED` is used instead, the
  first [`UPDATE`](update.md "15.2.17 UPDATE Statement") acquires an
  x-lock on each row that it reads and releases those for rows
  that it does not modify:

  ```none
  x-lock(1,2); unlock(1,2)
  x-lock(2,3); update(2,3) to (2,5); retain x-lock
  x-lock(3,2); unlock(3,2)
  x-lock(4,3); update(4,3) to (4,5); retain x-lock
  x-lock(5,2); unlock(5,2)
  ```

  For the second `UPDATE`,
  `InnoDB` does a
  “semi-consistent” read, returning the latest
  committed version of each row that it reads to MySQL so that
  MySQL can determine whether the row matches the
  `WHERE` condition of the
  [`UPDATE`](update.md "15.2.17 UPDATE Statement"):

  ```none
  x-lock(1,2); update(1,2) to (1,4); retain x-lock
  x-lock(2,3); unlock(2,3)
  x-lock(3,2); update(3,2) to (3,4); retain x-lock
  x-lock(4,3); unlock(4,3)
  x-lock(5,2); update(5,2) to (5,4); retain x-lock
  ```

  However, if the `WHERE` condition includes
  an indexed column, and `InnoDB` uses the
  index, only the indexed column is considered when taking and
  retaining record locks. In the following example, the first
  [`UPDATE`](update.md "15.2.17 UPDATE Statement") takes and retains an
  x-lock on each row where b = 2. The second
  [`UPDATE`](update.md "15.2.17 UPDATE Statement") blocks when it tries
  to acquire x-locks on the same records, as it also uses the
  index defined on column b.

  ```sql
  CREATE TABLE t (a INT NOT NULL, b INT, c INT, INDEX (b)) ENGINE = InnoDB;
  INSERT INTO t VALUES (1,2,3),(2,2,4);
  COMMIT;

  # Session A
  START TRANSACTION;
  UPDATE t SET b = 3 WHERE b = 2 AND c = 3;

  # Session B
  UPDATE t SET b = 4 WHERE b = 2 AND c = 4;
  ```

  The `READ COMMITTED` isolation level can be
  set at startup or changed at runtime. At runtime, it can be
  set globally for all sessions, or individually per session.
- `READ UNCOMMITTED`

  [`SELECT`](select.md "15.2.13 SELECT Statement") statements are
  performed in a nonlocking fashion, but a possible earlier
  version of a row might be used. Thus, using this isolation
  level, such reads are not consistent. This is also called a
  [dirty read](glossary.md#glos_dirty_read "dirty read").
  Otherwise, this isolation level works like
  [`READ COMMITTED`](innodb-transaction-isolation-levels.md#isolevel_read-committed).
- `SERIALIZABLE`

  This level is like [`REPEATABLE
  READ`](innodb-transaction-isolation-levels.md#isolevel_repeatable-read), but `InnoDB` implicitly
  converts all plain [`SELECT`](select.md "15.2.13 SELECT Statement")
  statements to [`SELECT
  ... FOR SHARE`](select.md "15.2.13 SELECT Statement") if
  [`autocommit`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_autocommit) is disabled. If
  [`autocommit`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_autocommit) is enabled, the
  [`SELECT`](select.md "15.2.13 SELECT Statement") is its own
  transaction. It therefore is known to be read only and can
  be serialized if performed as a consistent (nonlocking) read
  and need not block for other transactions. (To force a plain
  [`SELECT`](select.md "15.2.13 SELECT Statement") to block if other
  transactions have modified the selected rows, disable
  [`autocommit`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_autocommit).)

  Note

  As of MySQL 8.0.22, DML operations that read data from
  MySQL grant tables (through a join list or subquery) but
  do not modify them do not acquire read locks on the MySQL
  grant tables, regardless of the isolation level. For more
  information, see
  [Grant Table Concurrency](grant-tables.md#grant-tables-concurrency "Grant Table Concurrency").
