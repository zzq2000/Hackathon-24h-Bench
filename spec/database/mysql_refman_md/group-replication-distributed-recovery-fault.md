#### 20.5.4.4 Fault Tolerance for Distributed Recovery

Group Replication's distributed recovery process has a number of
built-in measures to ensure fault tolerance in the event of any
problems during the process.

The donor for distributed recovery is selected randomly from the
existing list of suitable online group members in the current
view. Selecting a random donor means that there is a good chance
that the same server is not selected more than once when
multiple members enter the group. In MySQL 8.0.17 and later, for
state transfer from the binary log, the joiner only selects a
donor that is running a lower or equal patch version of MySQL
Server compared to itself. For earlier releases, all of the
online members are allowed to be a donor. For a remote cloning
operation, the joiner selects a donor that is running the same
patch version as itself. When the member joining has restarted
at the end of the operation, it establishes a connection with a
new donor for state transfer from the binary log, which might be
a different member from the original donor used for the remote
cloning operation.

In the following situations, Group Replication detects an error
in distributed recovery, automatically switches over to a new
donor, and retries the state transfer:

- *Connection error* - There is an
  authentication issue or another problem with making the
  connection to a candidate donor.
- *Replication errors* - One of the
  replication threads (the receiver or applier threads) being
  used for state transfer from the binary log fails. Because
  this method of state transfer uses the existing MySQL
  replication framework, it is possible that some transient
  errors could cause errors in the receiver or applier
  threads.
- *Remote cloning operation errors* - A
  remote cloning operation fails or is stopped before it
  completes.
- *Donor leaves the group* - The donor
  leaves the group, or Group Replication is stopped on the
  donor, while state transfer is in progress.

The Performance Schema table
[`replication_applier_status_by_worker`](performance-schema-replication-applier-status-by-worker-table.md "29.12.11.5 The replication_applier_status_by_worker Table")
displays the error that caused the last retry. In these
situations, the new connection following the error is attempted
with a new candidate donor. Selecting a different donor in the
event of an error means that there is a chance the new candidate
donor does not have the same error. If the clone plugin is
installed, Group Replication attempts a remote cloning operation
with each of the suitable online clone-supporting donors first.
If all those attempts fail, Group Replication attempts state
transfer from the binary log with all the suitable donors in
turn, if that is possible.

Warning

For a remote cloning operation, user-created tablespaces and
data on the recipient (the joining member) are dropped before
the remote cloning operation begins to transfer the data from
the donor. If the remote cloning operation starts but does not
complete, the joining member might be left with a partial set
of its original data files, or with no user data. Data
transferred by the donor is removed from the recipient if the
cloning operation is stopped before the data is fully cloned.
This situation can be repaired by retrying the cloning
operation, which Group Replication does automatically.

In the following situations, the distributed recovery process
cannot be completed, and the joining member leaves the group:

- *Purged transactions* - Transactions that
  are required by the joining member are not present in any
  online group member's binary log files, and the data cannot
  be obtained by a remote cloning operation (because the clone
  plugin is not installed, or because cloning was attempted
  with all possible donors but failed). The joining member is
  therefore unable to catch up with the group.
- *Extra transactions* - The joining member
  already contains some transactions that are not present in
  the group. If a remote cloning operation was carried out,
  these transactions would be deleted and lost, because the
  data directory on the joining member is erased. If state
  transfer from a donor's binary log was carried out, these
  transactions could conflict with the group's transactions.
  For advice on dealing with this situation, see
  [Extra Transactions](group-replication-gtids.md#group-replication-gtids-extra "Extra Transactions").
- *Connection retry limit reached* - The
  joining member has made all the connection attempts allowed
  by the connection retry limit. You can configure this using
  the
  [`group_replication_recovery_retry_count`](group-replication-system-variables.md#sysvar_group_replication_recovery_retry_count)
  system variable (see
  [Section 20.5.4.3, “Configuring Distributed Recovery”](group-replication-tuning-recovery.md "20.5.4.3 Configuring Distributed Recovery")).
- *No more donors* - The joining member has
  unsuccessfully attempted a remote cloning operation with
  each of the online clone-supporting donors in turn (if the
  clone plugin is installed), then has unsuccessfully
  attempted state transfer from the binary log with each of
  the suitable online donors in turn, if possible.
- *Joining member leaves the group* - The
  joining member leaves the group or Group Replication is
  stopped on the joining member while state transfer is in
  progress.

If the joining member left the group unintentionally, so in any
situation listed above except the last, it proceeds to take the
action specified by the
[`group_replication_exit_state_action`](group-replication-system-variables.md#sysvar_group_replication_exit_state_action)
system variable.
