#### 25.2.7.3 Limits Relating to Transaction Handling in NDB Cluster

A number of limitations exist in NDB Cluster with regard to the
handling of transactions. These include the following:

- **Transaction isolation level.**

  The [`NDBCLUSTER`](mysql-cluster.md "Chapter 25 MySQL NDB Cluster 8.0") storage engine
  supports only the [`READ
  COMMITTED`](innodb-transaction-isolation-levels.md#isolevel_read-committed) transaction isolation level.
  (`InnoDB`, for example, supports
  [`READ COMMITTED`](innodb-transaction-isolation-levels.md#isolevel_read-committed),
  [`READ UNCOMMITTED`](innodb-transaction-isolation-levels.md#isolevel_read-uncommitted),
  [`REPEATABLE READ`](innodb-transaction-isolation-levels.md#isolevel_repeatable-read), and
  [`SERIALIZABLE`](innodb-transaction-isolation-levels.md#isolevel_serializable).) You
  should keep in mind that `NDB` implements
  `READ COMMITTED` on a per-row basis; when
  a read request arrives at the data node storing the row,
  what is returned is the last committed version of the row
  at that time.

  Uncommitted data is never returned, but when a transaction
  modifying a number of rows commits concurrently with a
  transaction reading the same rows, the transaction
  performing the read can observe “before”
  values, “after” values, or both, for different
  rows among these, due to the fact that a given row read
  request can be processed either before or after the commit
  of the other transaction.

  To ensure that a given transaction reads only before or
  after values, you can impose row locks using
  [`SELECT ... LOCK IN
  SHARE MODE`](select.md "15.2.13 SELECT Statement"). In such cases, the lock is held until
  the owning transaction is committed. Using row locks can
  also cause the following issues:

  - Increased frequency of lock wait timeout errors, and
    reduced concurrency
  - Increased transaction processing overhead due to reads
    requiring a commit phase
  - Possibility of exhausting the available number of
    concurrent locks, which is limited by
    [`MaxNoOfConcurrentOperations`](mysql-cluster-ndbd-definition.md#ndbparam-ndbd-maxnoofconcurrentoperations)

  `NDB` uses `READ
  COMMITTED` for all reads unless a modifier such as
  `LOCK IN SHARE MODE` or `FOR
  UPDATE` is used. `LOCK IN SHARE
  MODE` causes shared row locks to be used;
  `FOR UPDATE` causes exclusive row locks to
  be used. Unique key reads have their locks upgraded
  automatically by `NDB` to ensure a
  self-consistent read; `BLOB` reads also
  employ extra locking for consistency.

  See [Section 25.6.8.4, “NDB Cluster Backup Troubleshooting”](mysql-cluster-backup-troubleshooting.md "25.6.8.4 NDB Cluster Backup Troubleshooting"),
  for information on how NDB Cluster's implementation of
  transaction isolation level can affect backup and
  restoration of `NDB` databases.
- **Transactions and BLOB or TEXT columns.**
  [`NDBCLUSTER`](mysql-cluster.md "Chapter 25 MySQL NDB Cluster 8.0") stores only part
  of a column value that uses any of MySQL's
  [`BLOB`](blob.md "13.3.4 The BLOB and TEXT Types") or
  [`TEXT`](blob.md "13.3.4 The BLOB and TEXT Types") data types in the
  table visible to MySQL; the remainder of the
  [`BLOB`](blob.md "13.3.4 The BLOB and TEXT Types") or
  [`TEXT`](blob.md "13.3.4 The BLOB and TEXT Types") is stored in a
  separate internal table that is not accessible to MySQL.
  This gives rise to two related issues of which you should
  be aware whenever executing
  [`SELECT`](select.md "15.2.13 SELECT Statement") statements on tables
  that contain columns of these types:

  1. For any [`SELECT`](select.md "15.2.13 SELECT Statement") from an
     NDB Cluster table: If the
     [`SELECT`](select.md "15.2.13 SELECT Statement") includes a
     [`BLOB`](blob.md "13.3.4 The BLOB and TEXT Types") or
     [`TEXT`](blob.md "13.3.4 The BLOB and TEXT Types") column, the
     [`READ COMMITTED`](innodb-transaction-isolation-levels.md#isolevel_read-committed)
     transaction isolation level is converted to a read with
     read lock. This is done to guarantee consistency.
  2. For any [`SELECT`](select.md "15.2.13 SELECT Statement") which uses
     a unique key lookup to retrieve any columns that use any
     of the [`BLOB`](blob.md "13.3.4 The BLOB and TEXT Types") or
     [`TEXT`](blob.md "13.3.4 The BLOB and TEXT Types") data types and that
     is executed within a transaction, a shared read lock is
     held on the table for the duration of the
     transaction—that is, until the transaction is
     either committed or aborted.

     This issue does not occur for queries that use index or
     table scans, even against
     [`NDB`](mysql-cluster.md "Chapter 25 MySQL NDB Cluster 8.0") tables having
     [`BLOB`](blob.md "13.3.4 The BLOB and TEXT Types") or
     [`TEXT`](blob.md "13.3.4 The BLOB and TEXT Types") columns.

     For example, consider the table `t`
     defined by the following [`CREATE
     TABLE`](create-table.md "15.1.20 CREATE TABLE Statement") statement:

     ```sql
     CREATE TABLE t (
         a INT NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
         b INT NOT NULL,
         c INT NOT NULL,
         d TEXT,
         INDEX i(b),
         UNIQUE KEY u(c)
     ) ENGINE = NDB,
     ```

     The following query on `t` causes a
     shared read lock, because it uses a unique key lookup:

     ```sql
     SELECT * FROM t WHERE c = 1;
     ```

     However, none of the four queries shown here causes a
     shared read lock:

     ```sql
     SELECT * FROM t WHERE b = 1;

     SELECT * FROM t WHERE d = '1';

     SELECT * FROM t;

     SELECT b,c WHERE a = 1;
     ```

     This is because, of these four queries, the first uses
     an index scan, the second and third use table scans, and
     the fourth, while using a primary key lookup, does not
     retrieve the value of any
     [`BLOB`](blob.md "13.3.4 The BLOB and TEXT Types") or
     [`TEXT`](blob.md "13.3.4 The BLOB and TEXT Types") columns.

     You can help minimize issues with shared read locks by
     avoiding queries that use unique key lookups that
     retrieve [`BLOB`](blob.md "13.3.4 The BLOB and TEXT Types") or
     [`TEXT`](blob.md "13.3.4 The BLOB and TEXT Types") columns, or, in
     cases where such queries are not avoidable, by
     committing transactions as soon as possible afterward.
- **Unique key lookups and transaction isolation.**
  Unique indexes are implemented in `NDB`
  using a hidden index table which is maintained internally.
  When a user-created `NDB` table is
  accessed using a unique index, the hidden index table is
  first read to find the primary key that is then used to
  read the user-created table. To avoid modification of the
  index during this double-read operation, the row found in
  the hidden index table is locked. When a row referenced by
  a unique index in the user-created `NDB`
  table is updated, the hidden index table is subject to an
  exclusive lock by the transaction in which the update is
  performed. This means that any read operation on the same
  (user-created) `NDB` table must wait for
  the update to complete. This is true even when the
  transaction level of the read operation is
  [`READ COMMITTED`](innodb-transaction-isolation-levels.md#isolevel_read-committed).

  One workaround which can be used to bypass potentially
  blocking reads is to force the SQL node to ignore the unique
  index when performing the read. This can be done by using
  the `IGNORE INDEX` index hint as part of
  the [`SELECT`](select.md "15.2.13 SELECT Statement") statement reading
  the table (see [Section 10.9.4, “Index Hints”](index-hints.md "10.9.4 Index Hints")). Because the
  MySQL server creates a shadowing ordered index for every
  unique index created in `NDB`, this lets
  the ordered index be read instead, and avoids unique index
  access locking. The resulting read is as consistent as a
  committed read by primary key, returning the last committed
  value at the time the row is read.

  Reading via an ordered index makes less efficient use of
  resources in the cluster, and may have higher latency.

  It is also possible to avoid using the unique index for
  access by querying for ranges rather than for unique values.
- **Rollbacks.**
  There are no partial transactions, and no partial
  rollbacks of transactions. A duplicate key or similar
  error causes the entire transaction to be rolled back.

  This behavior differs from that of other transactional
  storage engines such as [`InnoDB`](innodb-storage-engine.md "Chapter 17 The InnoDB Storage Engine")
  that may roll back individual statements.
- **Transactions and memory usage.**
  As noted elsewhere in this chapter, NDB Cluster does not
  handle large transactions well; it is better to perform a
  number of small transactions with a few operations each
  than to attempt a single large transaction containing a
  great many operations. Among other considerations, large
  transactions require very large amounts of memory. Because
  of this, the transactional behavior of a number of MySQL
  statements is affected as described in the following list:

  - [`TRUNCATE TABLE`](truncate-table.md "15.1.37 TRUNCATE TABLE Statement") is not
    transactional when used on
    [`NDB`](mysql-cluster.md "Chapter 25 MySQL NDB Cluster 8.0") tables. If a
    [`TRUNCATE TABLE`](truncate-table.md "15.1.37 TRUNCATE TABLE Statement") fails to
    empty the table, then it must be re-run until it is
    successful.
  - `DELETE FROM` (even with no
    `WHERE` clause) *is*
    transactional. For tables containing a great many rows,
    you may find that performance is improved by using
    several `DELETE FROM ... LIMIT ...`
    statements to “chunk” the delete operation.
    If your objective is to empty the table, then you may
    wish to use [`TRUNCATE
    TABLE`](truncate-table.md "15.1.37 TRUNCATE TABLE Statement") instead.
  - **LOAD DATA statements.**
    [`LOAD DATA`](load-data.md "15.2.9 LOAD DATA Statement") is not
    transactional when used on
    [`NDB`](mysql-cluster.md "Chapter 25 MySQL NDB Cluster 8.0") tables.

    Important

    When executing a [`LOAD
    DATA`](load-data.md "15.2.9 LOAD DATA Statement") statement, the
    [`NDB`](mysql-cluster.md "Chapter 25 MySQL NDB Cluster 8.0") engine performs
    commits at irregular intervals that enable better
    utilization of the communication network. It is not
    possible to know ahead of time when such commits take
    place.
  - **ALTER TABLE and transactions.**
    When copying an [`NDB`](mysql-cluster.md "Chapter 25 MySQL NDB Cluster 8.0") table
    as part of an [`ALTER
    TABLE`](alter-table.md "15.1.9 ALTER TABLE Statement"), the creation of the copy is
    nontransactional. (In any case, this operation is
    rolled back when the copy is deleted.)
- **Transactions and the COUNT() function.**
  When using NDB Cluster Replication, it is not possible to
  guarantee the transactional consistency of the
  [`COUNT()`](aggregate-functions.md#function_count) function on the
  replica. In other words, when performing on the source a
  series of statements
  ([`INSERT`](insert.md "15.2.7 INSERT Statement"),
  [`DELETE`](delete.md "15.2.2 DELETE Statement"), or both) that
  changes the number of rows in a table within a single
  transaction, executing `SELECT COUNT(*) FROM
  table` queries on the
  replica may yield intermediate results. This is due to the
  fact that `SELECT COUNT(...)` may perform
  dirty reads, and is not a bug in the
  [`NDB`](mysql-cluster.md "Chapter 25 MySQL NDB Cluster 8.0") storage engine. (See Bug
  #31321 for more information.)
