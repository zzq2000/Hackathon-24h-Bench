#### 10.2.1.2 Range Optimization

The [`range`](explain-output.md#jointype_range) access method
uses a single index to retrieve a subset of table rows that
are contained within one or several index value intervals. It
can be used for a single-part or multiple-part index. The
following sections describe conditions under which the
optimizer uses range access.

##### Range Access Method for Single-Part Indexes

For a single-part index, index value intervals can be
conveniently represented by corresponding conditions in the
`WHERE` clause, denoted as
range conditions
rather than “intervals.”

The definition of a range condition for a single-part index
is as follows:

- For both `BTREE` and
  `HASH` indexes, comparison of a key
  part with a constant value is a range condition when
  using the
  [`=`](comparison-operators.md#operator_equal),
  [`<=>`](comparison-operators.md#operator_equal-to),
  [`IN()`](comparison-operators.md#operator_in), [`IS
  NULL`](comparison-operators.md#operator_is-null), or [`IS NOT
  NULL`](comparison-operators.md#operator_is-not-null) operators.
- Additionally, for `BTREE` indexes,
  comparison of a key part with a constant value is a
  range condition when using the
  [`>`](comparison-operators.md#operator_greater-than),
  [`<`](comparison-operators.md#operator_less-than),
  [`>=`](comparison-operators.md#operator_greater-than-or-equal),
  [`<=`](comparison-operators.md#operator_less-than-or-equal),
  [`BETWEEN`](comparison-operators.md#operator_between),
  [`!=`](comparison-operators.md#operator_not-equal),
  or
  [`<>`](comparison-operators.md#operator_not-equal)
  operators, or [`LIKE`](string-comparison-functions.md#operator_like)
  comparisons if the argument to
  [`LIKE`](string-comparison-functions.md#operator_like) is a constant string
  that does not start with a wildcard character.
- For all index types, multiple range conditions combined
  with [`OR`](logical-operators.md#operator_or) or
  [`AND`](logical-operators.md#operator_and) form a range condition.

“Constant value” in the preceding descriptions
means one of the following:

- A constant from the query string
- A column of a [`const`](explain-output.md#jointype_const)
  or [`system`](explain-output.md#jointype_system) table from
  the same join
- The result of an uncorrelated subquery
- Any expression composed entirely from subexpressions of
  the preceding types

Here are some examples of queries with range conditions in
the `WHERE` clause:

```sql
SELECT * FROM t1
  WHERE key_col > 1
  AND key_col < 10;

SELECT * FROM t1
  WHERE key_col = 1
  OR key_col IN (15,18,20);

SELECT * FROM t1
  WHERE key_col LIKE 'ab%'
  OR key_col BETWEEN 'bar' AND 'foo';
```

Some nonconstant values may be converted to constants during
the optimizer constant propagation phase.

MySQL tries to extract range conditions from the
`WHERE` clause for each of the possible
indexes. During the extraction process, conditions that
cannot be used for constructing the range condition are
dropped, conditions that produce overlapping ranges are
combined, and conditions that produce empty ranges are
removed.

Consider the following statement, where
`key1` is an indexed column and
`nonkey` is not indexed:

```sql
SELECT * FROM t1 WHERE
  (key1 < 'abc' AND (key1 LIKE 'abcde%' OR key1 LIKE '%b')) OR
  (key1 < 'bar' AND nonkey = 4) OR
  (key1 < 'uux' AND key1 > 'z');
```

The extraction process for key `key1` is as
follows:

1. Start with original `WHERE` clause:

   ```sql
   (key1 < 'abc' AND (key1 LIKE 'abcde%' OR key1 LIKE '%b')) OR
   (key1 < 'bar' AND nonkey = 4) OR
   (key1 < 'uux' AND key1 > 'z')
   ```
2. Remove `nonkey = 4` and `key1
   LIKE '%b'` because they cannot be used for a
   range scan. The correct way to remove them is to replace
   them with `TRUE`, so that we do not
   miss any matching rows when doing the range scan.
   Replacing them with `TRUE` yields:

   ```sql
   (key1 < 'abc' AND (key1 LIKE 'abcde%' OR TRUE)) OR
   (key1 < 'bar' AND TRUE) OR
   (key1 < 'uux' AND key1 > 'z')
   ```
3. Collapse conditions that are always true or false:

   - `(key1 LIKE 'abcde%' OR TRUE)` is
     always true
   - `(key1 < 'uux' AND key1 >
     'z')` is always false

   Replacing these conditions with constants yields:

   ```clike
   (key1 < 'abc' AND TRUE) OR (key1 < 'bar' AND TRUE) OR (FALSE)
   ```

   Removing unnecessary `TRUE` and
   `FALSE` constants yields:

   ```clike
   (key1 < 'abc') OR (key1 < 'bar')
   ```
4. Combining overlapping intervals into one yields the
   final condition to be used for the range scan:

   ```clike
   (key1 < 'bar')
   ```

In general (and as demonstrated by the preceding example),
the condition used for a range scan is less restrictive than
the `WHERE` clause. MySQL performs an
additional check to filter out rows that satisfy the range
condition but not the full `WHERE` clause.

The range condition extraction algorithm can handle nested
[`AND`](logical-operators.md#operator_and)/[`OR`](logical-operators.md#operator_or)
constructs of arbitrary depth, and its output does not
depend on the order in which conditions appear in
`WHERE` clause.

MySQL does not support merging multiple ranges for the
[`range`](explain-output.md#jointype_range) access method for
spatial indexes. To work around this limitation, you can use
a [`UNION`](union.md "15.2.18 UNION Clause") with identical
[`SELECT`](select.md "15.2.13 SELECT Statement") statements, except
that you put each spatial predicate in a different
[`SELECT`](select.md "15.2.13 SELECT Statement").

##### Range Access Method for Multiple-Part Indexes

Range conditions on a multiple-part index are an extension
of range conditions for a single-part index. A range
condition on a multiple-part index restricts index rows to
lie within one or several key tuple intervals. Key tuple
intervals are defined over a set of key tuples, using
ordering from the index.

For example, consider a multiple-part index defined as
`key1(key_part1,
key_part2,
key_part3)`, and the
following set of key tuples listed in key order:

```clike
key_part1  key_part2  key_part3
  NULL       1          'abc'
  NULL       1          'xyz'
  NULL       2          'foo'
   1         1          'abc'
   1         1          'xyz'
   1         2          'abc'
   2         1          'aaa'
```

The condition `key_part1
= 1` defines this interval:

```clike
(1,-inf,-inf) <= (key_part1,key_part2,key_part3) < (1,+inf,+inf)
```

The interval covers the 4th, 5th, and 6th tuples in the
preceding data set and can be used by the range access
method.

By contrast, the condition
`key_part3 =
'abc'` does not define a single interval and cannot
be used by the range access method.

The following descriptions indicate how range conditions
work for multiple-part indexes in greater detail.

- For `HASH` indexes, each interval
  containing identical values can be used. This means that
  the interval can be produced only for conditions in the
  following form:

  ```sql
      key_part1 cmp const1
  AND key_part2 cmp const2
  AND ...
  AND key_partN cmp constN;
  ```

  Here, *`const1`*,
  *`const2`*, … are
  constants, *`cmp`* is one of the
  [`=`](comparison-operators.md#operator_equal),
  [`<=>`](comparison-operators.md#operator_equal-to),
  or [`IS NULL`](comparison-operators.md#operator_is-null) comparison
  operators, and the conditions cover all index parts.
  (That is, there are *`N`*
  conditions, one for each part of an
  *`N`*-part index.) For example,
  the following is a range condition for a three-part
  `HASH` index:

  ```sql
  key_part1 = 1 AND key_part2 IS NULL AND key_part3 = 'foo'
  ```

  For the definition of what is considered to be a
  constant, see
  [Range Access Method for Single-Part Indexes](range-optimization.md#range-access-single-part "Range Access Method for Single-Part Indexes").
- For a `BTREE` index, an interval might
  be usable for conditions combined with
  [`AND`](logical-operators.md#operator_and), where each condition
  compares a key part with a constant value using
  [`=`](comparison-operators.md#operator_equal),
  [`<=>`](comparison-operators.md#operator_equal-to),
  [`IS NULL`](comparison-operators.md#operator_is-null),
  [`>`](comparison-operators.md#operator_greater-than),
  [`<`](comparison-operators.md#operator_less-than),
  [`>=`](comparison-operators.md#operator_greater-than-or-equal),
  [`<=`](comparison-operators.md#operator_less-than-or-equal),
  [`!=`](comparison-operators.md#operator_not-equal),
  [`<>`](comparison-operators.md#operator_not-equal),
  [`BETWEEN`](comparison-operators.md#operator_between), or
  [`LIKE
  'pattern'`](string-comparison-functions.md#operator_like) (where
  `'pattern'`
  does not start with a wildcard). An interval can be used
  as long as it is possible to determine a single key
  tuple containing all rows that match the condition (or
  two intervals if
  [`<>`](comparison-operators.md#operator_not-equal)
  or [`!=`](comparison-operators.md#operator_not-equal)
  is used).

  The optimizer attempts to use additional key parts to
  determine the interval as long as the comparison
  operator is
  [`=`](comparison-operators.md#operator_equal),
  [`<=>`](comparison-operators.md#operator_equal-to),
  or [`IS NULL`](comparison-operators.md#operator_is-null). If the operator
  is
  [`>`](comparison-operators.md#operator_greater-than),
  [`<`](comparison-operators.md#operator_less-than),
  [`>=`](comparison-operators.md#operator_greater-than-or-equal),
  [`<=`](comparison-operators.md#operator_less-than-or-equal),
  [`!=`](comparison-operators.md#operator_not-equal),
  [`<>`](comparison-operators.md#operator_not-equal),
  [`BETWEEN`](comparison-operators.md#operator_between), or
  [`LIKE`](string-comparison-functions.md#operator_like), the
  optimizer uses it but considers no more key parts. For
  the following expression, the optimizer uses
  [`=`](comparison-operators.md#operator_equal) from
  the first comparison. It also uses
  [`>=`](comparison-operators.md#operator_greater-than-or-equal)
  from the second comparison but considers no further key
  parts and does not use the third comparison for interval
  construction:

  ```sql
  key_part1 = 'foo' AND key_part2 >= 10 AND key_part3 > 10
  ```

  The single interval is:

  ```sql
  ('foo',10,-inf) < (key_part1,key_part2,key_part3) < ('foo',+inf,+inf)
  ```

  It is possible that the created interval contains more
  rows than the initial condition. For example, the
  preceding interval includes the value `('foo',
  11, 0)`, which does not satisfy the original
  condition.
- If conditions that cover sets of rows contained within
  intervals are combined with
  [`OR`](logical-operators.md#operator_or), they form a condition
  that covers a set of rows contained within the union of
  their intervals. If the conditions are combined with
  [`AND`](logical-operators.md#operator_and), they form a condition
  that covers a set of rows contained within the
  intersection of their intervals. For example, for this
  condition on a two-part index:

  ```sql
  (key_part1 = 1 AND key_part2 < 2) OR (key_part1 > 5)
  ```

  The intervals are:

  ```sql
  (1,-inf) < (key_part1,key_part2) < (1,2)
  (5,-inf) < (key_part1,key_part2)
  ```

  In this example, the interval on the first line uses one
  key part for the left bound and two key parts for the
  right bound. The interval on the second line uses only
  one key part. The `key_len` column in
  the [`EXPLAIN`](explain.md "15.8.2 EXPLAIN Statement") output
  indicates the maximum length of the key prefix used.

  In some cases, `key_len` may indicate
  that a key part was used, but that might be not what you
  would expect. Suppose that
  *`key_part1`* and
  *`key_part2`* can be
  `NULL`. Then the
  `key_len` column displays two key part
  lengths for the following condition:

  ```sql
  key_part1 >= 1 AND key_part2 < 2
  ```

  But, in fact, the condition is converted to this:

  ```sql
  key_part1 >= 1 AND key_part2 IS NOT NULL
  ```

For a description of how optimizations are performed to
combine or eliminate intervals for range conditions on a
single-part index, see
[Range Access Method for Single-Part Indexes](range-optimization.md#range-access-single-part "Range Access Method for Single-Part Indexes"). Analogous steps
are performed for range conditions on multiple-part indexes.

##### Equality Range Optimization of Many-Valued Comparisons

Consider these expressions, where
*`col_name`* is an indexed column:

```sql
col_name IN(val1, ..., valN)
col_name = val1 OR ... OR col_name = valN
```

Each expression is true if
*`col_name`* is equal to any of
several values. These comparisons are equality range
comparisons (where the “range” is a single
value). The optimizer estimates the cost of reading
qualifying rows for equality range comparisons as follows:

- If there is a unique index on
  *`col_name`*, the row estimate
  for each range is 1 because at most one row can have the
  given value.
- Otherwise, any index on
  *`col_name`* is nonunique and the
  optimizer can estimate the row count for each range
  using dives into the index or index statistics.

With index dives, the optimizer makes a dive at each end of
a range and uses the number of rows in the range as the
estimate. For example, the expression
`col_name IN (10, 20,
30)` has three equality ranges and the optimizer
makes two dives per range to generate a row estimate. Each
pair of dives yields an estimate of the number of rows that
have the given value.

Index dives provide accurate row estimates, but as the
number of comparison values in the expression increases, the
optimizer takes longer to generate a row estimate. Use of
index statistics is less accurate than index dives but
permits faster row estimation for large value lists.

The
[`eq_range_index_dive_limit`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_eq_range_index_dive_limit)
system variable enables you to configure the number of
values at which the optimizer switches from one row
estimation strategy to the other. To permit use of index
dives for comparisons of up to *`N`*
equality ranges, set
[`eq_range_index_dive_limit`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_eq_range_index_dive_limit)
to *`N`* + 1. To disable use of
statistics and always use index dives regardless of
*`N`*, set
[`eq_range_index_dive_limit`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_eq_range_index_dive_limit)
to 0.

To update table index statistics for best estimates, use
[`ANALYZE TABLE`](analyze-table.md "15.7.3.1 ANALYZE TABLE Statement").

Prior to MySQL 8.0, there is no way of skipping
the use of index dives to estimate index usefulness, except
by using the
[`eq_range_index_dive_limit`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_eq_range_index_dive_limit)
system variable. In MySQL 8.0, index dive
skipping is possible for queries that satisfy all these
conditions:

- The query is for a single table, not a join on multiple
  tables.
- A single-index `FORCE INDEX` index hint
  is present. The idea is that if index use is forced,
  there is nothing to be gained from the additional
  overhead of performing dives into the index.
- The index is nonunique and not a
  `FULLTEXT` index.
- No subquery is present.
- No `DISTINCT`, `GROUP
  BY`, or `ORDER BY` clause is
  present.

For [`EXPLAIN FOR
CONNECTION`](explain.md "15.8.2 EXPLAIN Statement"), the output changes as follows if index
dives are skipped:

- For traditional output, the `rows` and
  `filtered` values are
  `NULL`.
- For JSON output,
  `rows_examined_per_scan` and
  `rows_produced_per_join` do not appear,
  `skip_index_dive_due_to_force` is
  `true`, and cost calculations are not
  accurate.

Without `FOR CONNECTION`,
[`EXPLAIN`](explain.md "15.8.2 EXPLAIN Statement") output does not
change when index dives are skipped.

After execution of a query for which index dives are
skipped, the corresponding row in the Information Schema
[`OPTIMIZER_TRACE`](information-schema-optimizer-trace-table.md "28.3.19 The INFORMATION_SCHEMA OPTIMIZER_TRACE Table") table contains
an `index_dives_for_range_access` value of
`skipped_due_to_force_index`.

##### Skip Scan Range Access Method

Consider the following scenario:

```sql
CREATE TABLE t1 (f1 INT NOT NULL, f2 INT NOT NULL, PRIMARY KEY(f1, f2));
INSERT INTO t1 VALUES
  (1,1), (1,2), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5),
  (2,1), (2,2), (2,3), (2,4), (2,5);
INSERT INTO t1 SELECT f1, f2 + 5 FROM t1;
INSERT INTO t1 SELECT f1, f2 + 10 FROM t1;
INSERT INTO t1 SELECT f1, f2 + 20 FROM t1;
INSERT INTO t1 SELECT f1, f2 + 40 FROM t1;
ANALYZE TABLE t1;

EXPLAIN SELECT f1, f2 FROM t1 WHERE f2 > 40;
```

To execute this query, MySQL can choose an index scan to
fetch all rows (the index includes all columns to be
selected), then apply the `f2 > 40`
condition from the `WHERE` clause to
produce the final result set.

A range scan is more efficient than a full index scan, but
cannot be used in this case because there is no condition on
`f1`, the first index column. However, as
of MySQL 8.0.13, the optimizer can perform multiple range
scans, one for each value of `f1`, using a
method called Skip Scan that is similar to Loose Index Scan
(see [Section 10.2.1.17, “GROUP BY Optimization”](group-by-optimization.md "10.2.1.17 GROUP BY Optimization")):

1. Skip between distinct values of the first index part,
   `f1` (the index prefix).
2. Perform a subrange scan on each distinct prefix value
   for the `f2 > 40` condition on the
   remaining index part.

For the data set shown earlier, the algorithm operates like
this:

1. Get the first distinct value of the first key part
   (`f1 = 1`).
2. Construct the range based on the first and second key
   parts (`f1 = 1 AND f2 > 40`).
3. Perform a range scan.
4. Get the next distinct value of the first key part
   (`f1 = 2`).
5. Construct the range based on the first and second key
   parts (`f1 = 2 AND f2 > 40`).
6. Perform a range scan.

Using this strategy decreases the number of accessed rows
because MySQL skips the rows that do not qualify for each
constructed range. This Skip Scan access method is
applicable under the following conditions:

- Table T has at least one compound index with key parts
  of the form ([A\_1, ..., A\_*`k`*,]
  B\_1, ..., B\_*`m`*, C [, D\_1, ...,
  D\_*`n`*]). Key parts A and D may
  be empty, but B and C must be nonempty.
- The query references only one table.
- The query does not use `GROUP BY` or
  `DISTINCT`.
- The query references only columns in the index.
- The predicates on A\_1, ...,
  A\_*`k`* must be equality
  predicates and they must be constants. This includes the
  [`IN()`](comparison-operators.md#operator_in) operator.
- The query must be a conjunctive query; that is, an
  `AND` of `OR`
  conditions:
  `(cond1(key_part1)
  OR
  cond2(key_part1))
  AND
  (cond1(key_part2)
  OR ...) AND ...`
- There must be a range condition on C.
- Conditions on D columns are permitted. Conditions on D
  must be in conjunction with the range condition on C.

Use of Skip Scan is indicated in `EXPLAIN`
output as follows:

- `Using index for skip scan` in the
  `Extra` column indicates that the loose
  index Skip Scan access method is used.
- If the index can be used for Skip Scan, the index should
  be visible in the `possible_keys`
  column.

Use of Skip Scan is indicated in optimizer trace output by a
`"skip scan"` element of this form:

```json
"skip_scan_range": {
  "type": "skip_scan",
  "index": index_used_for_skip_scan,
  "key_parts_used_for_access": [key_parts_used_for_access],
  "range": [range]
}
```

You may also see a
`"best_skip_scan_summary"` element. If Skip
Scan is chosen as the best range access variant, a
`"chosen_range_access_summary"` is written.
If Skip Scan is chosen as the overall best access method, a
`"best_access_path"` element is present.

Use of Skip Scan is subject to the value of the
[`skip_scan`](switchable-optimizations.md#optflag_skip-scan) flag of the
[`optimizer_switch`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_optimizer_switch) system
variable. See [Section 10.9.2, “Switchable Optimizations”](switchable-optimizations.md "10.9.2 Switchable Optimizations"). By
default, this flag is `on`. To disable it,
set [`skip_scan`](switchable-optimizations.md#optflag_skip-scan) to
`off`.

In addition to using the
[`optimizer_switch`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_optimizer_switch) system
variable to control optimizer use of Skip Scan session-wide,
MySQL supports optimizer hints to influence the optimizer on
a per-statement basis. See
[Section 10.9.3, “Optimizer Hints”](optimizer-hints.md "10.9.3 Optimizer Hints").

##### Range Optimization of Row Constructor Expressions

The optimizer is able to apply the range scan access method
to queries of this form:

```sql
SELECT ... FROM t1 WHERE ( col_1, col_2 ) IN (( 'a', 'b' ), ( 'c', 'd' ));
```

Previously, for range scans to be used, it was necessary to
write the query as:

```sql
SELECT ... FROM t1 WHERE ( col_1 = 'a' AND col_2 = 'b' )
OR ( col_1 = 'c' AND col_2 = 'd' );
```

For the optimizer to use a range scan, queries must satisfy
these conditions:

- Only [`IN()`](comparison-operators.md#operator_in) predicates are
  used, not [`NOT IN()`](comparison-operators.md#operator_not-in).
- On the left side of the
  [`IN()`](comparison-operators.md#operator_in) predicate, the row
  constructor contains only column references.
- On the right side of the
  [`IN()`](comparison-operators.md#operator_in) predicate, row
  constructors contain only runtime constants, which are
  either literals or local column references that are
  bound to constants during execution.
- On the right side of the
  [`IN()`](comparison-operators.md#operator_in) predicate, there is
  more than one row constructor.

For more information about the optimizer and row
constructors, see
[Section 10.2.1.22, “Row Constructor Expression Optimization”](row-constructor-optimization.md "10.2.1.22 Row Constructor Expression Optimization")

##### Limiting Memory Use for Range Optimization

To control the memory available to the range optimizer, use
the
[`range_optimizer_max_mem_size`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_range_optimizer_max_mem_size)
system variable:

- A value of 0 means “no limit.”
- With a value greater than 0, the optimizer tracks the
  memory consumed when considering the range access
  method. If the specified limit is about to be exceeded,
  the range access method is abandoned and other methods,
  including a full table scan, are considered instead.
  This could be less optimal. If this happens, the
  following warning occurs (where
  *`N`* is the current
  [`range_optimizer_max_mem_size`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_range_optimizer_max_mem_size)
  value):

  ```none
  Warning    3170    Memory capacity of N bytes for
                     'range_optimizer_max_mem_size' exceeded. Range
                     optimization was not done for this query.
  ```
- For [`UPDATE`](update.md "15.2.17 UPDATE Statement") and
  [`DELETE`](delete.md "15.2.2 DELETE Statement") statements, if the
  optimizer falls back to a full table scan and the
  [`sql_safe_updates`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_sql_safe_updates) system
  variable is enabled, an error occurs rather than a
  warning because, in effect, no key is used to determine
  which rows to modify. For more information, see
  [Using Safe-Updates Mode (--safe-updates)](mysql-tips.md#safe-updates "Using Safe-Updates Mode (--safe-updates)").

For individual queries that exceed the available range
optimization memory and for which the optimizer falls back
to less optimal plans, increasing the
[`range_optimizer_max_mem_size`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_range_optimizer_max_mem_size)
value may improve performance.

To estimate the amount of memory needed to process a range
expression, use these guidelines:

- For a simple query such as the following, where there is
  one candidate key for the range access method, each
  predicate combined with [`OR`](logical-operators.md#operator_or)
  uses approximately 230 bytes:

  ```sql
  SELECT COUNT(*) FROM t
  WHERE a=1 OR a=2 OR a=3 OR .. . a=N;
  ```
- Similarly for a query such as the following, each
  predicate combined with [`AND`](logical-operators.md#operator_and)
  uses approximately 125 bytes:

  ```sql
  SELECT COUNT(*) FROM t
  WHERE a=1 AND b=1 AND c=1 ... N;
  ```
- For a query with [`IN()`](comparison-operators.md#operator_in)
  predicates:

  ```sql
  SELECT COUNT(*) FROM t
  WHERE a IN (1,2, ..., M) AND b IN (1,2, ..., N);
  ```

  Each literal value in an
  [`IN()`](comparison-operators.md#operator_in) list counts as a
  predicate combined with [`OR`](logical-operators.md#operator_or).
  If there are two [`IN()`](comparison-operators.md#operator_in)
  lists, the number of predicates combined with
  [`OR`](logical-operators.md#operator_or) is the product of the
  number of literal values in each list. Thus, the number
  of predicates combined with
  [`OR`](logical-operators.md#operator_or) in the preceding case is
  *`M`* ×
  *`N`*.
