#### 25.6.16.65 The ndbinfo transporters Table

This table contains aggregated information about NDB
transporters. In NDB 8.0.37 and later, you can obtain similar
information about individual transporters from the
[`transporter_details`](mysql-cluster-ndbinfo-transporter-details.md "25.6.16.64 The ndbinfo transporter_details Table") table.

The `transporters` table contains the following
columns:

- `node_id`

  This data node's unique node ID in the cluster
- `remote_node_id`

  The remote data node's node ID
- `status`

  Status of the connection
- `remote_address`

  Name or IP address of the remote host
- `bytes_sent`

  Number of bytes sent using this connection
- `bytes_received`

  Number of bytes received using this connection
- `connect_count`

  Number of times connection established on this transporter
- `overloaded`

  1 if this transporter is currently overloaded, otherwise 0
- `overload_count`

  Number of times this transporter has entered overload state
  since connecting
- `slowdown`

  1 if this transporter is in slowdown state, otherwise 0
- `slowdown_count`

  Number of times this transporter has entered slowdown state
  since connecting

##### Notes

For each running data node in the cluster, the
`transporters` table displays a row showing the
status of each of that node's connections with all nodes in
the cluster, *including itself*. This
information is shown in the table's
*status* column, which can have any one of
the following values: `CONNECTING`,
`CONNECTED`, `DISCONNECTING`,
or `DISCONNECTED`.

Connections to API and management nodes which are configured but
not currently connected to the cluster are shown with status
`DISCONNECTED`. Rows where the
`node_id` is that of a data node which is not
currently connected are not shown in this table. (This is
similar omission of disconnected nodes in the
[`ndbinfo.nodes`](mysql-cluster-ndbinfo-nodes.md "25.6.16.47 The ndbinfo nodes Table") table.

The `remote_address` is the host name or
address for the node whose ID is shown in the
`remote_node_id` column. The
`bytes_sent` from this node and
`bytes_received` by this node are the numbers,
respectively, of bytes sent and received by the node using this
connection since it was established. For nodes whose status is
`CONNECTING` or
`DISCONNECTED`, these columns always display
`0`.

Assume you have a 5-node cluster consisting of 2 data nodes, 2
SQL nodes, and 1 management node, as shown in the output of the
[`SHOW`](mysql-cluster-mgm-client-commands.md#ndbclient-show) command in the
[**ndb\_mgm**](mysql-cluster-programs-ndb-mgm.md "25.5.5 ndb_mgm — The NDB Cluster Management Client") client:

```ndbmgm
ndb_mgm> SHOW
Connected to Management Server at: localhost:1186
Cluster Configuration
---------------------
[ndbd(NDB)]     2 node(s)
id=1    @10.100.10.1  (8.0.44-ndb-8.0.44, Nodegroup: 0, *)
id=2    @10.100.10.2  (8.0.44-ndb-8.0.44, Nodegroup: 0)

[ndb_mgmd(MGM)] 1 node(s)
id=10   @10.100.10.10  (8.0.44-ndb-8.0.44)

[mysqld(API)]   2 node(s)
id=20   @10.100.10.20  (8.0.44-ndb-8.0.44)
id=21   @10.100.10.21  (8.0.44-ndb-8.0.44)
```

There are 10 rows in the `transporters`
table—5 for the first data node, and 5 for the
second—assuming that all data nodes are running, as shown
here:

```sql
mysql> SELECT node_id, remote_node_id, status
    ->   FROM ndbinfo.transporters;
+---------+----------------+---------------+
| node_id | remote_node_id | status        |
+---------+----------------+---------------+
|       1 |              1 | DISCONNECTED  |
|       1 |              2 | CONNECTED     |
|       1 |             10 | CONNECTED     |
|       1 |             20 | CONNECTED     |
|       1 |             21 | CONNECTED     |
|       2 |              1 | CONNECTED     |
|       2 |              2 | DISCONNECTED  |
|       2 |             10 | CONNECTED     |
|       2 |             20 | CONNECTED     |
|       2 |             21 | CONNECTED     |
+---------+----------------+---------------+
10 rows in set (0.04 sec)
```

If you shut down one of the data nodes in this cluster using the
command `2 STOP` in the
[**ndb\_mgm**](mysql-cluster-programs-ndb-mgm.md "25.5.5 ndb_mgm — The NDB Cluster Management Client") client, then repeat the previous
query (again using the [**mysql**](mysql.md "6.5.1 mysql — The MySQL Command-Line Client") client), this
table now shows only 5 rows—1 row for each connection from
the remaining management node to another node, including both
itself and the data node that is currently offline—and
displays `CONNECTING` for the status of each
remaining connection to the data node that is currently offline,
as shown here:

```sql
mysql> SELECT node_id, remote_node_id, status
    ->   FROM ndbinfo.transporters;
+---------+----------------+---------------+
| node_id | remote_node_id | status        |
+---------+----------------+---------------+
|       1 |              1 | DISCONNECTED  |
|       1 |              2 | CONNECTING    |
|       1 |             10 | CONNECTED     |
|       1 |             20 | CONNECTED     |
|       1 |             21 | CONNECTED     |
+---------+----------------+---------------+
5 rows in set (0.02 sec)
```

The `connect_count`,
`overloaded`,
`overload_count`, `slowdown`,
and `slowdown_count` counters are reset on
connection, and retain their values after the remote node
disconnects. The `bytes_sent` and
`bytes_received` counters are also reset on
connection, and so retain their values following disconnection
(until the next connection resets them).

The *overload* state referred to by the
`overloaded` and
`overload_count` columns occurs when this
transporter's send buffer contains more than
[`OVerloadLimit`](mysql-cluster-tcp-definition.md#ndbparam-tcp-overloadlimit) bytes
(default is 80% of
[`SendBufferMemory`](mysql-cluster-tcp-definition.md#ndbparam-tcp-sendbuffermemory), that
is, 0.8 \* 2097152 = 1677721 bytes). When a given transporter is
in a state of overload, any new transaction that tries to use
this transporter fails with Error 1218 (Send Buffers
overloaded in NDB kernel). This affects both scans
and primary key operations.

The *slowdown* state referenced by the
`slowdown` and
`slowdown_count` columns of this table occurs
when the transporter's send buffer contains more than 60%
of the overload limit (equal to 0.6 \* 2097152 = 1258291 bytes by
default). In this state, any new scan using this transporter has
its batch size reduced to minimize the load on the transporter.

Common causes of send buffer slowdown or overloading include the
following:

- Data size, in particular the quantity of data stored in
  [`TEXT`](blob.md "13.3.4 The BLOB and TEXT Types") columns or
  [`BLOB`](blob.md "13.3.4 The BLOB and TEXT Types") columns (or both types
  of columns)
- Having a data node (ndbd or ndbmtd) on the same host as an
  SQL node that is engaged in binary logging
- Large number of rows per transaction or transaction batch
- Configuration issues such as insufficient
  [`SendBufferMemory`](mysql-cluster-tcp-definition.md#ndbparam-tcp-sendbuffermemory)
- Hardware issues such as insufficient RAM or poor network
  connectivity
