#### 17.8.3.5 Configuring Buffer Pool Flushing

`InnoDB` performs certain tasks in the
background, including flushing of dirty pages from the buffer
pool. Dirty pages are those that have been modified but are not
yet written to the data files on disk.

In MySQL 8.0, buffer pool flushing is performed by
page cleaner threads. The number of page cleaner threads is
controlled by the
[`innodb_page_cleaners`](innodb-parameters.md#sysvar_innodb_page_cleaners) variable,
which has a default value of 4. However, if the number of page
cleaner threads exceeds the number of buffer pool instances,
[`innodb_page_cleaners`](innodb-parameters.md#sysvar_innodb_page_cleaners) is
automatically set to the same value as
[`innodb_buffer_pool_instances`](innodb-parameters.md#sysvar_innodb_buffer_pool_instances).

Buffer pool flushing is initiated when the percentage of dirty
pages reaches the low water mark value defined by the
[`innodb_max_dirty_pages_pct_lwm`](innodb-parameters.md#sysvar_innodb_max_dirty_pages_pct_lwm)
variable. The default low water mark is 10% of buffer pool
pages. A
[`innodb_max_dirty_pages_pct_lwm`](innodb-parameters.md#sysvar_innodb_max_dirty_pages_pct_lwm)
value of 0 disables this early flushing behaviour.

The purpose of the
[`innodb_max_dirty_pages_pct_lwm`](innodb-parameters.md#sysvar_innodb_max_dirty_pages_pct_lwm)
threshold is to control the percentage dirty pages in the buffer
pool and to prevent the amount of dirty pages from reaching the
threshold defined by the
[`innodb_max_dirty_pages_pct`](innodb-parameters.md#sysvar_innodb_max_dirty_pages_pct)
variable, which has a default value of 90.
`InnoDB` aggressively flushes buffer pool pages
if the percentage of dirty pages in the buffer pool reaches the
[`innodb_max_dirty_pages_pct`](innodb-parameters.md#sysvar_innodb_max_dirty_pages_pct)
threshold.

When configuring
[`innodb_max_dirty_pages_pct_lwm`](innodb-parameters.md#sysvar_innodb_max_dirty_pages_pct_lwm),
the value should always be lower than the
[`innodb_max_dirty_pages_pct`](innodb-parameters.md#sysvar_innodb_max_dirty_pages_pct)
value.

Additional variables permit fine-tuning of buffer pool flushing
behavior:

- The [`innodb_flush_neighbors`](innodb-parameters.md#sysvar_innodb_flush_neighbors)
  variable defines whether flushing a page from the buffer
  pool also flushes other dirty pages in the same extent.

  - The default setting of 0 disables
    [`innodb_flush_neighbors`](innodb-parameters.md#sysvar_innodb_flush_neighbors).
    Dirty pages in the same extent are not flushed. This
    setting is recommended for non-rotational storage (SSD)
    devices where seek time is not a significant factor.
  - A setting of 1 flushes contiguous dirty pages in the
    same extent.
  - A setting of 2 flushes dirty pages in the same extent.

  When table data is stored on a traditional
  [HDD](glossary.md#glos_hdd "HDD") storage device, flushing
  neighbor pages in one operation reduces I/O overhead
  (primarily for disk seek operations) compared to flushing
  individual pages at different times. For table data stored
  on [SSD](glossary.md#glos_ssd "SSD"), seek time is not a
  significant factor and you can disable this setting to
  spread out write operations.
- The [`innodb_lru_scan_depth`](innodb-parameters.md#sysvar_innodb_lru_scan_depth)
  variable specifies, per buffer pool instance, how far down
  the buffer pool LRU list the page cleaner thread scans
  looking for dirty pages to flush. This is a background
  operation performed by a page cleaner thread once per
  second.

  A setting smaller than the default is generally suitable for
  most workloads. A value that is significantly higher than
  necessary may impact performance. Only consider increasing
  the value if you have spare I/O capacity under a typical
  workload. Conversely, if a write-intensive workload
  saturates your I/O capacity, decrease the value, especially
  in the case of a large buffer pool.

  When tuning
  [`innodb_lru_scan_depth`](innodb-parameters.md#sysvar_innodb_lru_scan_depth),
  start with a low value and configure the setting upward with
  the goal of rarely seeing zero free pages. Also, consider
  adjusting
  [`innodb_lru_scan_depth`](innodb-parameters.md#sysvar_innodb_lru_scan_depth) when
  changing the number of buffer pool instances, since
  [`innodb_lru_scan_depth`](innodb-parameters.md#sysvar_innodb_lru_scan_depth) \*
  [`innodb_buffer_pool_instances`](innodb-parameters.md#sysvar_innodb_buffer_pool_instances)
  defines the amount of work performed by the page cleaner
  thread each second.

The [`innodb_flush_neighbors`](innodb-parameters.md#sysvar_innodb_flush_neighbors) and
[`innodb_lru_scan_depth`](innodb-parameters.md#sysvar_innodb_lru_scan_depth) variables
are primarily intended for write-intensive workloads. With heavy
DML activity, flushing can fall behind if it is not aggressive
enough, or disk writes can saturate I/O capacity if flushing is
too aggressive. The ideal settings depend on your workload, data
access patterns, and storage configuration (for example, whether
data is stored on HDD or SSD devices).

##### Adaptive Flushing

`InnoDB` uses an adaptive flushing algorithm
to dynamically adjust the rate of flushing based on the speed
of redo log generation and the current rate of flushing. The
intent is to smooth overall performance by ensuring that
flushing activity keeps pace with the current workload.
Automatically adjusting the flushing rate helps avoid sudden
dips in throughput that can occur when bursts of I/O activity
due to buffer pool flushing affects the I/O capacity available
for ordinary read and write activity.

Sharp checkpoints, which are typically associated with
write-intensive workloads that generate a lot of redo entries,
can cause a sudden change in throughput, for example. A sharp
checkpoint occurs when `InnoDB` wants to
reuse a portion of a log file. Before doing so, all dirty
pages with redo entries in that portion of the log file must
be flushed. If log files become full, a sharp checkpoint
occurs, causing a temporary reduction in throughput. This
scenario can occur even if
[`innodb_max_dirty_pages_pct`](innodb-parameters.md#sysvar_innodb_max_dirty_pages_pct)
threshold is not reached.

The adaptive flushing algorithm helps avoid such scenarios by
tracking the number of dirty pages in the buffer pool and the
rate at which redo log records are being generated. Based on
this information, it decides how many dirty pages to flush
from the buffer pool each second, which permits it to manage
sudden changes in workload.

The
[`innodb_adaptive_flushing_lwm`](innodb-parameters.md#sysvar_innodb_adaptive_flushing_lwm)
variable defines a low water mark for redo log capacity. When
that threshold is crossed, adaptive flushing is enabled, even
if the
[`innodb_adaptive_flushing`](innodb-parameters.md#sysvar_innodb_adaptive_flushing)
variable is disabled.

Internal benchmarking has shown that the algorithm not only
maintains throughput over time, but can also improve overall
throughput significantly. However, adaptive flushing can
affect the I/O pattern of a workload significantly and may not
be appropriate in all cases. It gives the most benefit when
the redo log is in danger of filling up. If adaptive flushing
is not appropriate to the characteristics of your workload,
you can disable it. Adaptive flushing controlled by the
[`innodb_adaptive_flushing`](innodb-parameters.md#sysvar_innodb_adaptive_flushing)
variable, which is enabled by default.

[`innodb_flushing_avg_loops`](innodb-parameters.md#sysvar_innodb_flushing_avg_loops)
defines the number of iterations that
`InnoDB` keeps the previously calculated
snapshot of the flushing state, controlling how quickly
adaptive flushing responds to foreground workload changes. A
high
[`innodb_flushing_avg_loops`](innodb-parameters.md#sysvar_innodb_flushing_avg_loops)
value means that `InnoDB` keeps the
previously calculated snapshot longer, so adaptive flushing
responds more slowly. When setting a high value it is
important to ensure that redo log utilization does not reach
75% (the hardcoded limit at which asynchronous flushing
starts), and that the
[`innodb_max_dirty_pages_pct`](innodb-parameters.md#sysvar_innodb_max_dirty_pages_pct)
threshold keeps the number of dirty pages to a level that is
appropriate for the workload.

Systems with consistent workloads, a large log file size
([`innodb_log_file_size`](innodb-parameters.md#sysvar_innodb_log_file_size)), and
small spikes that do not reach 75% log space utilization
should use a high
[`innodb_flushing_avg_loops`](innodb-parameters.md#sysvar_innodb_flushing_avg_loops)
value to keep flushing as smooth as possible. For systems with
extreme load spikes or log files that do not provide a lot of
space, a smaller value allows flushing to closely track
workload changes, and helps to avoid reaching 75% log space
utilization.

Be aware that if flushing falls behind, the rate of buffer
pool flushing can exceed the I/O capacity available to
`InnoDB`, as defined by
[`innodb_io_capacity`](innodb-parameters.md#sysvar_innodb_io_capacity) setting.
The [`innodb_io_capacity_max`](innodb-parameters.md#sysvar_innodb_io_capacity_max)
value defines an upper limit on I/O capacity in such
situations, so that a spike in I/O activity does not consume
the entire I/O capacity of the server.

The [`innodb_io_capacity`](innodb-parameters.md#sysvar_innodb_io_capacity)
setting is applicable to all buffer pool instances. When dirty
pages are flushed, I/O capacity is divided equally among
buffer pool instances.

##### Limiting Buffer Flushing During Idle Periods

As of MySQL 8.0.18, you can use the
[`innodb_idle_flush_pct`](innodb-parameters.md#sysvar_innodb_idle_flush_pct)
variable to limit the rate of buffer pool flushing during idle
periods, which are periods of time that database pages are not
modified. The
[`innodb_idle_flush_pct`](innodb-parameters.md#sysvar_innodb_idle_flush_pct) value
is a percentage of the
[`innodb_io_capacity`](innodb-parameters.md#sysvar_innodb_io_capacity) setting,
which defines the number of I/O operations per second
available to `InnoDB`. The default
[`innodb_idle_flush_pct`](innodb-parameters.md#sysvar_innodb_idle_flush_pct) value
is 100, which is 100 percent of the
[`innodb_io_capacity`](innodb-parameters.md#sysvar_innodb_io_capacity) setting.
To limit flushing during idle periods, define an
[`innodb_idle_flush_pct`](innodb-parameters.md#sysvar_innodb_idle_flush_pct) value
less than 100.

Limiting page flushing during idle periods can help extend the
life of solid state storage devices. Side effects of limiting
page flushing during idle periods may include a longer
shutdown time following a lengthy idle period, and a longer
recovery period should a server failure occur.
