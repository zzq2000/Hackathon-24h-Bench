##### Notes

The `fq_name` contains the fully qualified name
of the schema object to which this fragment replica belongs.
This currently has the following formats:

- Base table:
  `DbName/def/TblName`
- `BLOB` table:
  `DbName/def/NDB$BLOB_BaseTblId_ColNo`
- Ordered index:
  `sys/def/BaseTblId/IndexName`
- Unique index:
  `sys/def/BaseTblId/IndexName$unique`

The `$unique` suffix shown for unique indexes
is added by [**mysqld**](mysqld.md "6.3.1 mysqld — The MySQL Server"); for an index created by a
different NDB API client application, this may differ, or not be
present.

The syntax just shown for fully qualified object names is an
internal interface which is subject to change in future
releases.

Consider a table `t1` created and modified by
the following SQL statements:

```sql
CREATE DATABASE mydb;

USE mydb;

CREATE TABLE t1 (
  a INT NOT NULL,
  b INT NOT NULL,
  t TEXT NOT NULL,
  PRIMARY KEY (b)
) ENGINE=ndbcluster;

CREATE UNIQUE INDEX ix1 ON t1(b) USING HASH;
```

If `t1` is assigned table ID 11, this yields
the `fq_name` values shown here:

- Base table: `mydb/def/t1`
- `BLOB` table:
  `mydb/def/NDB$BLOB_11_2`
- Ordered index (primary key):
  `sys/def/11/PRIMARY`
- Unique index: `sys/def/11/ix1$unique`

For indexes or `BLOB` tables, the
`parent_fq_name` column contains the
`fq_name` of the corresponding base table. For
base tables, this column is always `NULL`.

The `type` column shows the schema object type
used for this fragment, which can take any one of the values
`System table`, `User table`,
`Unique hash index`, or `Ordered
index`. `BLOB` tables are shown as
`User table`.

The `table_id` column value is unique at any
given time, but can be reused if the corresponding object has
been deleted. The same ID can be seen using the
[**ndb\_show\_tables**](mysql-cluster-programs-ndb-show-tables.md "25.5.27 ndb_show_tables — Display List of NDB Tables") utility.

The `block_instance` column shows which LDM
instance this fragment replica belongs to. You can use this to
obtain information about specific threads from the
[`threadblocks`](mysql-cluster-ndbinfo-threadblocks.md "25.6.16.61 The ndbinfo threadblocks Table") table. The first
such instance is always numbered 0.

Since there are typically two fragment replicas, and assuming
that this is so, each `fragment_num` value
should appear twice in the table, on two different data nodes
from the same node group.

Since `NDB` does not use single-key access for
ordered indexes, the counts for
`tot_key_reads`,
`tot_key_inserts`,
`tot_key_updates`,
`tot_key_writes`, and
`tot_key_deletes` are not incremented by
ordered index operations.

Note

When using `tot_key_writes`, you should keep
in mind that a write operation in this context updates the row
if the key exists, and inserts a new row otherwise. (One use
of this is in the `NDB` implementation of the
[`REPLACE`](replace.md "15.2.12 REPLACE Statement") SQL statement.)

The `tot_key_refs` column shows the number of
key operations refused by the LDM. Generally, such a refusal is
due to duplicate keys (inserts), Key not
found errors (updates, deletes, and reads), or the
operation was rejected by an interpreted program used as a
predicate on the row matching the key.

The `attrinfo` and `keyinfo`
attributes counted by the
`tot_key_attrinfo_bytes` and
`tot_key_keyinfo_bytes` columns are attributes
of an `LQHKEYREQ` signal (see
[The NDB Communication Protocol](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/ndb-internals/en/ndb-internals-ndb-protocol.html)) used to initiate a
key operation by the LDM. An `attrinfo`
typically contains tuple field values (inserts and updates) or
projection specifications (for reads);
`keyinfo` contains the primary or unique key
needed to locate a given tuple in this schema object.

The value shown by `tot_frag_scans` includes
both full scans (that examine every row) and scans of subsets.
Unique indexes and `BLOB` tables are never
scanned, so this value, like other scan-related counts, is 0 for
fragment replicas of these.

`tot_scan_rows_examined` may display less than
the total number of rows in a given fragment replica, since
ordered index scans can limited by bounds. In addition, a client
may choose to end a scan before all potentially matching rows
have been examined; this occurs when using an SQL statement
containing a `LIMIT` or
`EXISTS` clause, for example.
`tot_scan_rows_returned` is always less than or
equal to `tot_scan_rows_examined`.

`tot_scan_bytes_returned` includes, in the case
of pushed joins, projections returned to the
[`DBSPJ`](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/ndb-internals/en/ndb-internals-kernel-blocks-dbspj.html) block in the NDB
kernel.

`tot_qd_frag_scans` can be effected by the
setting for the
[`MaxParallelScansPerFragment`](mysql-cluster-ndbd-definition.md#ndbparam-ndbd-maxparallelscansperfragment)
data node configuration parameter, which limits the number of
scans that may execute concurrently on a single fragment
replica.
