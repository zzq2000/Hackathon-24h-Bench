### 6.2.5 Connecting to the Server Using URI-Like Strings or Key-Value Pairs

This section describes use of URI-like connection strings or
key-value pairs to specify how to establish connections to the
MySQL server, for clients such as MySQL Shell. For information on
establishing connections using command-line options, for clients
such as [**mysql**](mysql.md "6.5.1 mysql — The MySQL Command-Line Client") or [**mysqldump**](mysqldump.md "6.5.4 mysqldump — A Database Backup Program"),
see [Section 6.2.4, “Connecting to the MySQL Server Using Command Options”](connecting.md "6.2.4 Connecting to the MySQL Server Using Command Options"). For additional information if
you are unable to connect, see
[Section 8.2.22, “Troubleshooting Problems Connecting to MySQL”](problems-connecting.md "8.2.22 Troubleshooting Problems Connecting to MySQL").

Note

The term “URI-like” signifies connection-string
syntax that is similar to but not identical to the URI (uniform
resource identifier) syntax defined by
[RFC
3986](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3986).

The following MySQL clients support connecting to a MySQL server
using a URI-like connection string or key-value pairs:

- MySQL Shell
- MySQL Connectors which implement X DevAPI

This section documents all valid URI-like string and key-value
pair connection parameters, many of which are similar to those
specified with command-line options:

- Parameters specified with a URI-like string use a syntax such
  as `myuser@example.com:3306/main-schema`. For
  the full syntax, see [Connecting Using URI-Like Connection Strings](connecting-using-uri-or-key-value-pairs.md#connecting-using-uri "Connecting Using URI-Like Connection Strings").
- Parameters specified with key-value pairs use a syntax such as
  `{user:'myuser', host:'example.com', port:3306,
  schema:'main-schema'}`. For the full syntax, see
  [Connecting Using Key-Value Pairs](connecting-using-uri-or-key-value-pairs.md#connecting-using-key-value-pairs "Connecting Using Key-Value Pairs").

Connection parameters are not case-sensitive. Each parameter, if
specified, can be given only once. If a parameter is specified
more than once, an error occurs.

This section covers the following topics:

- [Base Connection Parameters](connecting-using-uri-or-key-value-pairs.md#connection-parameters-base "Base Connection Parameters")
- [Additional Connection parameters](connecting-using-uri-or-key-value-pairs.md#connection-parameters-additional "Additional Connection parameters")
- [Connecting Using URI-Like Connection Strings](connecting-using-uri-or-key-value-pairs.md#connecting-using-uri "Connecting Using URI-Like Connection Strings")
- [Connecting Using Key-Value Pairs](connecting-using-uri-or-key-value-pairs.md#connecting-using-key-value-pairs "Connecting Using Key-Value Pairs")

#### Base Connection Parameters

The following discussion describes the parameters available when
specifying a connection to MySQL. These parameters can be
provided using either a string that conforms to the base
URI-like syntax (see [Connecting Using URI-Like Connection Strings](connecting-using-uri-or-key-value-pairs.md#connecting-using-uri "Connecting Using URI-Like Connection Strings")), or
as key-value pairs (see
[Connecting Using Key-Value Pairs](connecting-using-uri-or-key-value-pairs.md#connecting-using-key-value-pairs "Connecting Using Key-Value Pairs")).

- *`scheme`*: The transport protocol to
  use. Use `mysqlx` for X Protocol
  connections and `mysql` for
  classic MySQL protocol connections. If no protocol is specified,
  the server attempts to guess the protocol. Connectors that
  support DNS SRV can use the `mysqlx+srv`
  scheme (see [Connections Using DNS SRV Records](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/x-devapi-userguide/en/connecting-dns-srv.html)).
- *`user`*: The MySQL user account to
  provide for the authentication process.
- *`password`*: The password to use for
  the authentication process.

  Warning

  Specifying an explicit password in the connection
  specification is insecure and not recommended. Later
  discussion shows how to cause an interactive prompt for
  the password to occur.
- *`host`*: The host on which the
  server instance is running. The value can be a host name,
  IPv4 address, or IPv6 address. If no host is specified, the
  default is `localhost`.
- *`port`*: The TCP/IP network port on
  which the target MySQL server is listening for connections.
  If no port is specified, the default is 33060 for
  X Protocol connections and 3306 for classic MySQL protocol
  connections.
- *`socket`*: The path to a Unix socket
  file or the name of a Windows named pipe. Values are local
  file paths. In URI-like strings, they must be encoded, using
  either percent encoding or by surrounding the path with
  parentheses. Parentheses eliminate the need to percent
  encode characters such as the `/` directory
  separator character. For example, to connect as
  `root@localhost` using the Unix socket
  `/tmp/mysql.sock`, specify the path using
  percent encoding as
  `root@localhost?socket=%2Ftmp%2Fmysql.sock`,
  or using parentheses as
  `root@localhost?socket=(/tmp/mysql.sock)`.
- *`schema`*: The default database for
  the connection. If no database is specified, the connection
  has no default database.

The handling of `localhost` on Unix depends on
the type of transport protocol. Connections using
classic MySQL protocol handle `localhost` the same
way as other MySQL clients, which means that
`localhost` is assumed to be for socket-based
connections. For connections using X Protocol, the behavior of
`localhost` differs in that it is assumed to
represent the loopback address, for example, IPv4 address
127.0.0.1.

#### Additional Connection parameters

You can specify options for the connection, either as attributes
in a URI-like string by appending
`?attribute=value`,
or as key-value pairs. The following options are available:

- `ssl-mode`: The desired security state for
  the connection. The following modes are permissible:

  - `DISABLED`
  - `PREFERRED`
  - `REQUIRED`
  - `VERIFY_CA`
  - `VERIFY_IDENTITY`

  Important

  `VERIFY_CA` and
  `VERIFY_IDENTITY` are better choices than
  the default `PREFERRED`, because they
  help prevent man-in-the-middle attacks.

  For information about these modes, see the
  [`--ssl-mode`](connection-options.md#option_general_ssl-mode) option
  description in
  [Command Options for Encrypted Connections](connection-options.md#encrypted-connection-options "Command Options for Encrypted Connections").
- `ssl-ca`: The path to the X.509 certificate
  authority file in PEM format.
- `ssl-capath`: The path to the directory
  that contains the X.509 certificates authority files in PEM
  format.
- `ssl-cert`: The path to the X.509
  certificate file in PEM format.
- `ssl-cipher`: The encryption cipher to use
  for connections that use TLS protocols up through TLSv1.2.
- `ssl-crl`: The path to the file that
  contains certificate revocation lists in PEM format.
- `ssl-crlpath`: The path to the directory
  that contains certificate revocation-list files in PEM
  format.
- `ssl-key`: The path to the X.509 key file
  in PEM format.
- `tls-version`: The TLS protocols permitted
  for classic MySQL protocol encrypted connections. This option is
  supported by MySQL Shell only. The value of
  `tls-version` (singular) is a comma
  separated list, for example
  `TLSv1.2,TLSv1.3`. For details, see
  [Section 8.3.2, “Encrypted Connection TLS Protocols and Ciphers”](encrypted-connection-protocols-ciphers.md "8.3.2 Encrypted Connection TLS Protocols and Ciphers").
  This option depends on the `ssl-mode`
  option not being set to `DISABLED`.
- `tls-versions`: The permissible TLS
  protocols for encrypted X Protocol connections. The value
  of `tls-versions` (plural) is an array such
  as `[TLSv1.2,TLSv1.3]`. For details, see
  [Section 8.3.2, “Encrypted Connection TLS Protocols and Ciphers”](encrypted-connection-protocols-ciphers.md "8.3.2 Encrypted Connection TLS Protocols and Ciphers").
  This option depends on the `ssl-mode`
  option not being set to `DISABLED`.
- `tls-ciphersuites`: The permitted TLS
  cipher suites. The value of
  `tls-ciphersuites` is a list of IANA cipher
  suite names as listed at
  [TLS
  Ciphersuites](https://www.iana.org/assignments/tls-parameters/tls-parameters.xhtml#tls-parameters-4). For details, see
  [Section 8.3.2, “Encrypted Connection TLS Protocols and Ciphers”](encrypted-connection-protocols-ciphers.md "8.3.2 Encrypted Connection TLS Protocols and Ciphers").
  This option depends on the `ssl-mode`
  option not being set to `DISABLED`.
- `auth-method`: The authentication method to
  use for the connection. The default is
  `AUTO`, meaning that the server attempts to
  guess. The following methods are permissible:

  - `AUTO`
  - `MYSQL41`
  - `SHA256_MEMORY`
  - `FROM_CAPABILITIES`
  - `FALLBACK`
  - `PLAIN`

  For X Protocol connections, any configured
  `auth-method` is overridden to this
  sequence of authentication methods:
  `MYSQL41`,
  `SHA256_MEMORY`, `PLAIN`.
- `get-server-public-key`: Request from the
  server the public key required for RSA key pair-based
  password exchange. Use when connecting to MySQL 8.0 servers
  over classic MySQL protocol with SSL mode
  `DISABLED`. You must specify the protocol
  in this case. For example:

  ```simple
  mysql://user@localhost:3306?get-server-public-key=true
  ```

  This option applies to clients that authenticate with the
  `caching_sha2_password` authentication
  plugin. For that plugin, the server does not send the public
  key unless requested. This option is ignored for accounts
  that do not authenticate with that plugin. It is also
  ignored if RSA-based password exchange is not used, as is
  the case when the client connects to the server using a
  secure connection.

  If
  `server-public-key-path=file_name`
  is given and specifies a valid public key file, it takes
  precedence over `get-server-public-key`.

  For information about the
  `caching_sha2_password` plugin, see
  [Section 8.4.1.2, “Caching SHA-2 Pluggable Authentication”](caching-sha2-pluggable-authentication.md "8.4.1.2 Caching SHA-2 Pluggable Authentication").
- `server-public-key-path`: The path name to
  a file in PEM format containing a client-side copy of the
  public key required by the server for RSA key pair-based
  password exchange. Use when connecting to MySQL 8.0 servers
  over classic MySQL protocol with SSL mode
  `DISABLED`.

  This option applies to clients that authenticate with the
  `sha256_password` or
  `caching_sha2_password` authentication
  plugin. This option is ignored for accounts that do not
  authenticate with one of those plugins. It is also ignored
  if RSA-based password exchange is not used, as is the case
  when the client connects to the server using a secure
  connection.

  If
  `server-public-key-path=file_name`
  is given and specifies a valid public key file, it takes
  precedence over `get-server-public-key`.

  For information about the `sha256_password`
  and `caching_sha2_password` plugins, see
  [Section 8.4.1.3, “SHA-256 Pluggable Authentication”](sha256-pluggable-authentication.md "8.4.1.3 SHA-256 Pluggable Authentication"), and
  [Section 8.4.1.2, “Caching SHA-2 Pluggable Authentication”](caching-sha2-pluggable-authentication.md "8.4.1.2 Caching SHA-2 Pluggable Authentication").
- `ssh`: The URI for connection to an SSH
  server to access a MySQL server instance using SSH
  tunneling. The URI format is
  `[user@]host[:port]`. Use the
  `uri` option to specify the URI of the
  target MySQL server instance. For information on SSH tunnel
  connections from MySQL Shell, see
  [Using an SSH Tunnel](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/mysql-shell/8.0/en/mysql-shell-connection-ssh.html).
- `uri`: The URI for a MySQL server instance
  that is to be accessed through an SSH tunnel from the server
  specified by the `ssh` option. The URI
  format is `[scheme://][user@]host[:port]`.
  Do not use the base connection parameters
  (`scheme`, `user`,
  `host`, `port`) to specify
  the MySQL server connection for SSH tunneling, just use the
  `uri` option.
- `ssh-password`: The password for the
  connection to the SSH server.

  Warning

  Specifying an explicit password in the connection
  specification is insecure and not recommended.
  MySQL Shell prompts for a password interactively when one
  is required.
- `ssh-config-file`: The SSH configuration
  file for the connection to the SSH server. You can use the
  MySQL Shell configuration option
  `ssh.configFile` to set a custom file as
  the default if this option is not specified. If
  `ssh.configFile` has not been set, the
  default is the standard SSH configuration file
  `~/.ssh/config`.
- `ssh-identity-file`: The identity file to
  use for the connection to the SSH server. The default if
  this option is not specified is any identity file configured
  in an SSH agent (if used), or in the SSH configuration file,
  or the standard private key file in the SSH configuration
  folder (`~/.ssh/id_rsa`).
- `ssh-identity-pass`: The passphrase for the
  identity file specified by the
  `ssh-identity-file` option.

  Warning

  Specifying an explicit password in the connection
  specification is insecure and not recommended.
  MySQL Shell prompts for a password interactively when one
  is required.
- `connect-timeout`: An integer value used to
  configure the number of seconds that clients, such as
  MySQL Shell, wait until they stop trying to connect to an
  unresponsive MySQL server.
- `compression`: This option requests or
  disables compression for the connection. Up to MySQL 8.0.19
  it operates for classic MySQL protocol connections only, and from
  MySQL 8.0.20 it also operates for X Protocol connections.

  - Up to MySQL 8.0.19, the values for this option are
    `true` (or 1) which enables
    compression, and the default `false`
    (or 0) which disables compression.
  - From MySQL 8.0.20, the values for this option are
    `required`, which requests
    compression and fails if the server does not support
    it; `preferred`, which requests
    compression and falls back to an uncompressed
    connection; and `disabled`, which
    requests an uncompressed connection and fails if the
    server does not permit those.
    `preferred` is the default for
    X Protocol connections, and
    `disabled` is the default for
    classic MySQL protocol connections. For information on
    X Plugin connection compression control, see
    [Section 22.5.5, “Connection Compression with X Plugin”](x-plugin-connection-compression.md "22.5.5 Connection Compression with X Plugin").

  Note that different MySQL clients implement their support
  for connection compression differently. Consult your
  client's documentation for details.
- `compression-algorithms` and
  `compression-level`: These options are
  available in MySQL Shell 8.0.20 and later for more control
  over connection compression. You can specify them to select
  the compression algorithm used for the connection, and the
  numeric compression level used with that algorithm. You can
  also use `compression-algorithms` in place
  of `compression` to request compression for
  the connection. For information on MySQL Shell's connection
  compression control, see
  [Using Compressed Connections](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/mysql-shell/8.0/en/mysql-shell-compressed-connections.html).
- `connection-attributes`: Controls the
  key-value pairs that application programs pass to the server
  at connect time. For general information about connection
  attributes, see
  [Section 29.12.9, “Performance Schema Connection Attribute Tables”](performance-schema-connection-attribute-tables.md "29.12.9 Performance Schema Connection Attribute Tables").
  Clients usually define a default set of attributes, which
  can be disabled or enabled. For example:

  ```simple
  mysqlx://user@host?connection-attributes
  mysqlx://user@host?connection-attributes=true
  mysqlx://user@host?connection-attributes=false
  ```

  The default behavior is to send the default attribute set.
  Applications can specify attributes to be passed in addition
  to the default attributes. You specify additional connection
  attributes as a `connection-attributes`
  parameter in a connection string. The
  `connection-attributes` parameter value
  must be empty (the same as specifying
  `true`), a `Boolean` value
  (`true` or `false` to
  enable or disable the default attribute set), or a list or
  zero or more `key=value` specifiers
  separated by commas (to be sent in addition to the default
  attribute set). Within a list, a missing key value evaluates
  as an empty string. Further examples:

  ```simple
  mysqlx://user@host?connection-attributes=[attr1=val1,attr2,attr3=]
  mysqlx://user@host?connection-attributes=[]
  ```

  Application-defined attribute names cannot begin with
  `_` because such names are reserved for
  internal attributes.

#### Connecting Using URI-Like Connection Strings

You can specify a connection to MySQL Server using a URI-like
string. Such strings can be used with the MySQL Shell with the
[`--uri`](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/mysql-shell/8.0/en/mysqlsh.html#option_mysqlsh_uri) command option, the
MySQL Shell `\connect` command, and MySQL
Connectors which implement X DevAPI.

Note

The term “URI-like” signifies connection-string
syntax that is similar to but not identical to the URI
(uniform resource identifier) syntax defined by
[RFC
3986](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3986).

A URI-like connection string has the following syntax:

```simple
[scheme://][user[:[password]]@]host[:port][/schema][?attribute1=value1&attribute2=value2...
```

Important

Percent encoding must be used for reserved characters in the
elements of the URI-like string. For example, if you specify a
string that includes the `@` character, the
character must be replaced by `%40`. If you
include a zone ID in an IPv6 address, the `%`
character used as the separator must be replaced with
`%25`.

The parameters you can use in a URI-like connection string are
described at [Base Connection Parameters](connecting-using-uri-or-key-value-pairs.md#connection-parameters-base "Base Connection Parameters").

MySQL Shell's `shell.parseUri()` and
`shell.unparseUri()` methods can be used to
deconstruct and assemble a URI-like connection string. Given a
URI-like connection string, `shell.parseUri()`
returns a dictionary containing each element found in the
string. `shell.unparseUri()` converts a
dictionary of URI components and connection options into a valid
URI-like connection string for connecting to MySQL, which can be
used in MySQL Shell or by MySQL Connectors which implement
X DevAPI.

If no password is specified in the URI-like string, which is
recommended, interactive clients prompt for the password. The
following examples show how to specify URI-like strings with the
user name *`user_name`*. In each case,
the password is prompted for.

- An X Protocol connection to a local server instance
  listening at port 33065.

  ```simple
  mysqlx://user_name@localhost:33065
  ```
- A classic MySQL protocol connection to a local server instance
  listening at port 3333.

  ```simple
  mysql://user_name@localhost:3333
  ```
- An X Protocol connection to a remote server instance, using
  a host name, an IPv4 address, and an IPv6 address.

  ```simple
  mysqlx://user_name@server.example.com/
  mysqlx://user_name@198.51.100.14:123
  mysqlx://user_name@[2001:db8:85a3:8d3:1319:8a2e:370:7348]
  ```
- An X Protocol connection using a socket, with the path
  provided using either percent encoding or parentheses.

  ```simple
  mysqlx://user_name@/path%2Fto%2Fsocket.sock
  mysqlx://user_name@(/path/to/socket.sock)
  ```
- An optional path can be specified, which represents a
  database.

  ```simple
  # use 'world' as the default database
  mysqlx://user_name@198.51.100.1/world

  # use 'world_x' as the default database, encoding _ as %5F
  mysqlx://user_name@198.51.100.2:33060/world%5Fx
  ```
- An optional query can be specified, consisting of values
  each given as a
  `key=value`
  pair or as a single *`key`*. To
  specify multiple values, separate them by
  `,` characters. A mix of
  `key=value`
  and *`key`* values is permissible.
  Values can be of type list, with list values ordered by
  appearance. Strings must be either percent encoded or
  surrounded by parentheses. The following are equivalent.

  ```simple
  ssluser@127.0.0.1?ssl-ca=%2Froot%2Fclientcert%2Fca-cert.pem\
  &ssl-cert=%2Froot%2Fclientcert%2Fclient-cert.pem\
  &ssl-key=%2Froot%2Fclientcert%2Fclient-key

  ssluser@127.0.0.1?ssl-ca=(/root/clientcert/ca-cert.pem)\
  &ssl-cert=(/root/clientcert/client-cert.pem)\
  &ssl-key=(/root/clientcert/client-key)
  ```
- To specify a TLS version and ciphersuite to use for
  encrypted connections:

  ```simple
  mysql://user_name@198.51.100.2:3306/world%5Fx?\
  tls-versions=[TLSv1.2,TLSv1.3]&tls-ciphersuites=[TLS_DHE_PSK_WITH_AES_128_\
  GCM_SHA256, TLS_CHACHA20_POLY1305_SHA256]
  ```

The previous examples assume that connections require a
password. With interactive clients, the specified user's
password is requested at the login prompt. If the user account
has no password (which is insecure and not recommended), or if
socket peer-credential authentication is in use (for example,
with Unix socket connections), you must explicitly specify in
the connection string that no password is being provided and the
password prompt is not required. To do this, place a
`:` after the
*`user_name`* in the string but do not
specify a password after it. For example:

```simple
mysqlx://user_name:@localhost
```

#### Connecting Using Key-Value Pairs

In MySQL Shell and some MySQL Connectors which implement
X DevAPI, you can specify a connection to MySQL Server using
key-value pairs, supplied in language-natural constructs for the
implementation. For example, you can supply connection
parameters using key-value pairs as a JSON object in JavaScript,
or as a dictionary in Python. Regardless of the way the
key-value pairs are supplied, the concept remains the same: the
keys as described in this section can be assigned values that
are used to specify a connection. You can specify connections
using key-value pairs in MySQL Shell's
`shell.connect()` method or InnoDB Cluster's
`dba.createCluster()` method, and with some of
the MySQL Connectors which implement X DevAPI.

Generally, key-value pairs are surrounded by
`{` and `}` characters and the
`,` character is used as a separator between
key-value pairs. The `:` character is used
between keys and values, and strings must be delimited (for
example, using the `'` character). It is not
necessary to percent encode strings, unlike URI-like connection
strings.

A connection specified as key-value pairs has the following
format:

```simple
{ key: value, key: value, ...}
```

The parameters you can use as keys for a connection are
described at [Base Connection Parameters](connecting-using-uri-or-key-value-pairs.md#connection-parameters-base "Base Connection Parameters").

If no password is specified in the key-value pairs, which is
recommended, interactive clients prompt for the password. The
following examples show how to specify connections using
key-value pairs with the user name
`'user_name'`. In
each case, the password is prompted for.

- An X Protocol connection to a local server instance
  listening at port 33065.

  ```simple
  {user:'user_name', host:'localhost', port:33065}
  ```
- A classic MySQL protocol connection to a local server instance
  listening at port 3333.

  ```simple
  {user:'user_name', host:'localhost', port:3333}
  ```
- An X Protocol connection to a remote server instance, using
  a host name, an IPv4 address, and an IPv6 address.

  ```simple
  {user:'user_name', host:'server.example.com'}
  {user:'user_name', host:198.51.100.14:123}
  {user:'user_name', host:[2001:db8:85a3:8d3:1319:8a2e:370:7348]}
  ```
- An X Protocol connection using a socket.

  ```simple
  {user:'user_name', socket:'/path/to/socket/file'}
  ```
- An optional schema can be specified, which represents a
  database.

  ```simple
  {user:'user_name', host:'localhost', schema:'world'}
  ```

The previous examples assume that connections require a
password. With interactive clients, the specified user's
password is requested at the login prompt. If the user account
has no password (which is insecure and not recommended), or if
socket peer-credential authentication is in use (for example,
with Unix socket connections), you must explicitly specify that
no password is being provided and the password prompt is not
required. To do this, provide an empty string using
`''` after the `password` key.
For example:

```simple
{user:'user_name', password:'', host:'localhost'}
```
