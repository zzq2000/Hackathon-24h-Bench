## 12.15 Character Set Configuration

The MySQL server has a compiled-in default character set and
collation. To change these defaults, use the
[`--character-set-server`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_character_set_server) and
[`--collation-server`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_collation_server) options when you
start the server. See [Section 7.1.7, “Server Command Options”](server-options.md "7.1.7 Server Command Options"). The
collation must be a legal collation for the default character set.
To determine which collations are available for each character
set, use the [`SHOW COLLATION`](show-collation.md "15.7.7.4 SHOW COLLATION Statement")
statement or query the `INFORMATION_SCHEMA`
[`COLLATIONS`](information-schema-collations-table.md "28.3.6 The INFORMATION_SCHEMA COLLATIONS Table") table.

If you try to use a character set that is not compiled into your
binary, you might run into the following problems:

- If your program uses an incorrect path to determine where the
  character sets are stored (which is typically the
  `share/mysql/charsets` or
  `share/charsets` directory under the MySQL
  installation directory), this can be fixed by using the
  `--character-sets-dir` option when you run the
  program. For example, to specify a directory to be used by
  MySQL client programs, list it in the
  `[client]` group of your option file. The
  examples given here show what the setting might look like for
  Unix or Windows, respectively:

  ```ini
  [client]
  character-sets-dir=/usr/local/mysql/share/mysql/charsets

  [client]
  character-sets-dir="C:/Program Files/MySQL/MySQL Server 8.0/share/charsets"
  ```
- If the character set is a complex character set that cannot be
  loaded dynamically, you must recompile the program with
  support for the character set.

  For Unicode character sets, you can define collations without
  recompiling by using LDML notation. See
  [Section 12.14.4, “Adding a UCA Collation to a Unicode Character Set”](adding-collation-unicode-uca.md "12.14.4 Adding a UCA Collation to a Unicode Character Set").
- If the character set is a dynamic character set, but you do
  not have a configuration file for it, you should install the
  configuration file for the character set from a new MySQL
  distribution.
- If your character set index file
  (`Index.xml`) does not contain the name for
  the character set, your program displays an error message:

  ```none
  Character set 'charset_name' is not a compiled character set and is not
  specified in the '/usr/share/mysql/charsets/Index.xml' file
  ```

  To solve this problem, you should either get a new index file
  or manually add the name of any missing character sets to the
  current file.

You can force client programs to use specific character set as
follows:

```ini
[client]
default-character-set=charset_name
```

This is normally unnecessary. However, when
[`character_set_system`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_character_set_system) differs from
[`character_set_server`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_character_set_server) or
[`character_set_client`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_character_set_client), and you
input characters manually (as database object identifiers, column
values, or both), these may be displayed incorrectly in output
from the client or the output itself may be formatted incorrectly.
In such cases, starting the mysql client with
[`--default-character-set=system_character_set`](mysql-command-options.md#option_mysql_default-character-set)—that
is, setting the client character set to match the system character
set—should fix the problem.
