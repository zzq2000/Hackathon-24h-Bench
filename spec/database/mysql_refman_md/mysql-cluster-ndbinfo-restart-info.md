#### 25.6.16.52 The ndbinfo restart\_info Table

The `restart_info` table contains information
about node restart operations. Each entry in the table
corresponds to a node restart status report in real time from a
data node with the given node ID. Only the most recent report
for any given node is shown.

The `restart_info` table contains the following
columns:

- `node_id`

  Node ID in the cluster
- `node_restart_status`

  Node status; see text for values. Each of these corresponds
  to a possible value of
  `node_restart_status_int`.
- `node_restart_status_int`

  Node status code; see text for values.
- `secs_to_complete_node_failure`

  Time in seconds to complete node failure handling
- `secs_to_allocate_node_id`

  Time in seconds from node failure completion to allocation
  of node ID
- `secs_to_include_in_heartbeat_protocol`

  Time in seconds from allocation of node ID to inclusion in
  heartbeat protocol
- `secs_until_wait_for_ndbcntr_master`

  Time in seconds from being included in heartbeat protocol
  until waiting for
  [`NDBCNTR`](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/ndb-internals/en/ndb-internals-kernel-blocks-ndbcntr.html) master began
- `secs_wait_for_ndbcntr_master`

  Time in seconds spent waiting to be accepted by
  [`NDBCNTR`](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/ndb-internals/en/ndb-internals-kernel-blocks-ndbcntr.html) master for
  starting
- `secs_to_get_start_permitted`

  Time in seconds elapsed from receiving of permission for
  start from master until all nodes have accepted start of
  this node
- `secs_to_wait_for_lcp_for_copy_meta_data`

  Time in seconds spent waiting for LCP completion before
  copying metadata
- `secs_to_copy_meta_data`

  Time in seconds required to copy metadata from master to
  newly starting node
- `secs_to_include_node`

  Time in seconds waited for GCP and inclusion of all nodes
  into protocols
- `secs_starting_node_to_request_local_recovery`

  Time in seconds that the node just starting spent waiting to
  request local recovery
- `secs_for_local_recovery`

  Time in seconds required for local recovery by node just
  starting
- `secs_restore_fragments`

  Time in seconds required to restore fragments from LCP files
- `secs_undo_disk_data`

  Time in seconds required to execute undo log on disk data
  part of records
- `secs_exec_redo_log`

  Time in seconds required to execute redo log on all restored
  fragments
- `secs_index_rebuild`

  Time in seconds required to rebuild indexes on restored
  fragments
- `secs_to_synchronize_starting_node`

  Time in seconds required to synchronize starting node from
  live nodes
- `secs_wait_lcp_for_restart`

  Time in seconds required for LCP start and completion before
  restart was completed
- `secs_wait_subscription_handover`

  Time in seconds spent waiting for handover of replication
  subscriptions
- `total_restart_secs`

  Total number of seconds from node failure until node is
  started again

##### Notes

The following list contains values defined for the
`node_restart_status_int` column with their
internal status names (in parentheses), and the corresponding
messages shown in the `node_restart_status`
column:

- `0` (`ALLOCATED_NODE_ID`)

  `Allocated node id`
- `1`
  (`INCLUDED_IN_HB_PROTOCOL`)

  `Included in heartbeat protocol`

  start`
- `3` (`NDBCNTR_STARTED`)

  `NDBCNTR master permitted us to start`
- `4` (`START_PERMITTED`)

  `All nodes permitted us to start`
- `5`
  (`WAIT_LCP_TO_COPY_DICT`)

  `Wait for LCP completion to start copying
  metadata`
- `6`
  (`COPY_DICT_TO_STARTING_NODE`)

  `Copying metadata to starting node`
- `7`
  (`INCLUDE_NODE_IN_LCP_AND_GCP`)

  `Include node in LCP and GCP protocols`

  `Wait for LCP to ensure durability`
- `11`
  (`WAIT_SUMA_HANDOVER`)

  `Wait for handover of subscriptions`
- `12` (`RESTART_COMPLETED`)

  `Restart completed`
- `13` (`NODE_FAILED`)

  `Node failed, failure handling in progress`
- `14`
  (`NODE_FAILURE_COMPLETED`)

  `Restart completed`
- `20`
  (`NOT_DEFINED_IN_CLUSTER`)

  (`NODE_NOT_RESTARTED_YET`)

  `Initial state`

Status numbers 0 through 12 apply on master nodes only; the
remainder of those shown in the table apply to all restarting
data nodes. Status numbers 13 and 14 define node failure states;
20 and 21 occur when no information about the restart of a given
node is available.
