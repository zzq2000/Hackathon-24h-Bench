### 13.3.1 String Data Type Syntax

The string data types are [`CHAR`](char.md "13.3.2 The CHAR and VARCHAR Types"),
[`VARCHAR`](char.md "13.3.2 The CHAR and VARCHAR Types"),
[`BINARY`](binary-varbinary.md "13.3.3 The BINARY and VARBINARY Types"),
[`VARBINARY`](binary-varbinary.md "13.3.3 The BINARY and VARBINARY Types"),
[`BLOB`](blob.md "13.3.4 The BLOB and TEXT Types"),
[`TEXT`](blob.md "13.3.4 The BLOB and TEXT Types"),
[`ENUM`](enum.md "13.3.5 The ENUM Type"), and
[`SET`](set.md "13.3.6 The SET Type").

In some cases, MySQL may change a string column to a type
different from that given in a [`CREATE
TABLE`](create-table.md "15.1.20 CREATE TABLE Statement") or [`ALTER TABLE`](alter-table.md "15.1.9 ALTER TABLE Statement")
statement. See [Section 15.1.20.7, “Silent Column Specification Changes”](silent-column-changes.md "15.1.20.7 Silent Column Specification Changes").

For definitions of character string columns
([`CHAR`](char.md "13.3.2 The CHAR and VARCHAR Types"),
[`VARCHAR`](char.md "13.3.2 The CHAR and VARCHAR Types"), and the
[`TEXT`](blob.md "13.3.4 The BLOB and TEXT Types") types), MySQL interprets
length specifications in character units. For definitions of
binary string columns ([`BINARY`](binary-varbinary.md "13.3.3 The BINARY and VARBINARY Types"),
[`VARBINARY`](binary-varbinary.md "13.3.3 The BINARY and VARBINARY Types"), and the
[`BLOB`](blob.md "13.3.4 The BLOB and TEXT Types") types), MySQL interprets
length specifications in byte units.

Column definitions for character string data types
[`CHAR`](char.md "13.3.2 The CHAR and VARCHAR Types"),
[`VARCHAR`](char.md "13.3.2 The CHAR and VARCHAR Types"), the
[`TEXT`](blob.md "13.3.4 The BLOB and TEXT Types") types,
[`ENUM`](enum.md "13.3.5 The ENUM Type"),
[`SET`](set.md "13.3.6 The SET Type"), and any synonyms) can
specify the column character set and collation:

- `CHARACTER SET` specifies the character
  set. If desired, a collation for the character set can be
  specified with the `COLLATE` attribute,
  along with any other attributes. For example:

  ```sql
  CREATE TABLE t
  (
      c1 VARCHAR(20) CHARACTER SET utf8mb4,
      c2 TEXT CHARACTER SET latin1 COLLATE latin1_general_cs
  );
  ```

  This table definition creates a column named
  `c1` that has a character set of
  `utf8mb4` with the default collation for
  that character set, and a column named `c2`
  that has a character set of `latin1` and a
  case-sensitive (`_cs`) collation.

  The rules for assigning the character set and collation when
  either or both of `CHARACTER SET` and the
  `COLLATE` attribute are missing are
  described in [Section 12.3.5, “Column Character Set and Collation”](charset-column.md "12.3.5 Column Character Set and Collation").

  `CHARSET` is a synonym for
  `CHARACTER SET`.
- Specifying the `CHARACTER SET binary`
  attribute for a character string data type causes the column
  to be created as the corresponding binary string data type:
  [`CHAR`](char.md "13.3.2 The CHAR and VARCHAR Types") becomes
  [`BINARY`](binary-varbinary.md "13.3.3 The BINARY and VARBINARY Types"),
  [`VARCHAR`](char.md "13.3.2 The CHAR and VARCHAR Types") becomes
  [`VARBINARY`](binary-varbinary.md "13.3.3 The BINARY and VARBINARY Types"), and
  [`TEXT`](blob.md "13.3.4 The BLOB and TEXT Types") becomes
  [`BLOB`](blob.md "13.3.4 The BLOB and TEXT Types"). For the
  [`ENUM`](enum.md "13.3.5 The ENUM Type") and
  [`SET`](set.md "13.3.6 The SET Type") data types, this does not
  occur; they are created as declared. Suppose that you
  specify a table using this definition:

  ```sql
  CREATE TABLE t
  (
    c1 VARCHAR(10) CHARACTER SET binary,
    c2 TEXT CHARACTER SET binary,
    c3 ENUM('a','b','c') CHARACTER SET binary
  );
  ```

  The resulting table has this definition:

  ```sql
  CREATE TABLE t
  (
    c1 VARBINARY(10),
    c2 BLOB,
    c3 ENUM('a','b','c') CHARACTER SET binary
  );
  ```
- The `BINARY` attribute is a nonstandard
  MySQL extension that is shorthand for specifying the binary
  (`_bin`) collation of the column character
  set (or of the table default character set if no column
  character set is specified). In this case, comparison and
  sorting are based on numeric character code values. Suppose
  that you specify a table using this definition:

  ```sql
  CREATE TABLE t
  (
    c1 VARCHAR(10) CHARACTER SET latin1 BINARY,
    c2 TEXT BINARY
  ) CHARACTER SET utf8mb4;
  ```

  The resulting table has this definition:

  ```sql
  CREATE TABLE t (
    c1 VARCHAR(10) CHARACTER SET latin1 COLLATE latin1_bin,
    c2 TEXT CHARACTER SET utf8mb4 COLLATE utf8mb4_bin
  ) CHARACTER SET utf8mb4;
  ```

  In MySQL 8.0, this nonstandard use of the
  `BINARY` attribute is ambiguous because the
  `utf8mb4` character set has multiple
  `_bin` collations. As of MySQL 8.0.17, the
  `BINARY` attribute is deprecated and you
  should expect support for it to be removed in a future
  version of MySQL. Applications should be adjusted to use an
  explicit `_bin` collation instead.

  The use of `BINARY` to specify a data type
  or character set remains unchanged.
- The `ASCII` attribute is shorthand for
  `CHARACTER SET latin1`. Supported in older
  MySQL releases, `ASCII` is deprecated in
  MySQL 8.0.28 and later; use `CHARACTER SET`
  instead.
- The `UNICODE` attribute is shorthand for
  `CHARACTER SET ucs2`. Supported in older
  MySQL releases, `UNICODE` is deprecated in
  MySQL 8.0.28 and later; use `CHARACTER SET`
  instead.

Character column comparison and sorting are based on the
collation assigned to the column. For the
[`CHAR`](char.md "13.3.2 The CHAR and VARCHAR Types"),
[`VARCHAR`](char.md "13.3.2 The CHAR and VARCHAR Types"),
[`TEXT`](blob.md "13.3.4 The BLOB and TEXT Types"),
[`ENUM`](enum.md "13.3.5 The ENUM Type"), and
[`SET`](set.md "13.3.6 The SET Type") data types, you can declare a
column with a binary (`_bin`) collation or the
`BINARY` attribute to cause comparison and
sorting to use the underlying character code values rather than
a lexical ordering.

For additional information about use of character sets in MySQL,
see [Chapter 12, *Character Sets, Collations, Unicode*](charset.md "Chapter 12 Character Sets, Collations, Unicode").

- `[NATIONAL] CHAR[(M)]
  [CHARACTER SET charset_name]
  [COLLATE
  collation_name]`

  A fixed-length string that is always right-padded with
  spaces to the specified length when stored.
  *`M`* represents the column length in
  characters. The range of *`M`* is 0
  to 255. If *`M`* is omitted, the
  length is 1.

  Note

  Trailing spaces are removed when
  [`CHAR`](char.md "13.3.2 The CHAR and VARCHAR Types") values are retrieved
  unless the
  [`PAD_CHAR_TO_FULL_LENGTH`](sql-mode.md#sqlmode_pad_char_to_full_length)
  SQL mode is enabled.

  [`CHAR`](char.md "13.3.2 The CHAR and VARCHAR Types") is shorthand for
  [`CHARACTER`](char.md "13.3.2 The CHAR and VARCHAR Types").
  [`NATIONAL CHAR`](char.md "13.3.2 The CHAR and VARCHAR Types") (or its
  equivalent short form, [`NCHAR`](char.md "13.3.2 The CHAR and VARCHAR Types"))
  is the standard SQL way to define that a
  [`CHAR`](char.md "13.3.2 The CHAR and VARCHAR Types") column should use some
  predefined character set. MySQL uses
  `utf8mb3` as this predefined character set.
  [Section 12.3.7, “The National Character Set”](charset-national.md "12.3.7 The National Character Set").

  The [`CHAR BYTE`](binary-varbinary.md "13.3.3 The BINARY and VARBINARY Types") data type is an
  alias for the [`BINARY`](binary-varbinary.md "13.3.3 The BINARY and VARBINARY Types") data
  type. This is a compatibility feature.

  MySQL permits you to create a column of type
  `CHAR(0)`. This is useful primarily when
  you must be compliant with old applications that depend on
  the existence of a column but that do not actually use its
  value. `CHAR(0)` is also quite nice when
  you need a column that can take only two values: A column
  that is defined as `CHAR(0) NULL` occupies
  only one bit and can take only the values
  `NULL` and `''` (the empty
  string).
- `[NATIONAL] VARCHAR(M)
  [CHARACTER SET charset_name]
  [COLLATE
  collation_name]`

  A variable-length string. *`M`*
  represents the maximum column length in characters. The
  range of *`M`* is 0 to 65,535. The
  effective maximum length of a
  [`VARCHAR`](char.md "13.3.2 The CHAR and VARCHAR Types") is subject to the
  maximum row size (65,535 bytes, which is shared among all
  columns) and the character set used. For example,
  `utf8mb3` characters can require up to
  three bytes per character, so a
  [`VARCHAR`](char.md "13.3.2 The CHAR and VARCHAR Types") column that uses the
  `utf8mb3` character set can be declared to
  be a maximum of 21,844 characters. See
  [Section 10.4.7, “Limits on Table Column Count and Row Size”](column-count-limit.md "10.4.7 Limits on Table Column Count and Row Size").

  MySQL stores [`VARCHAR`](char.md "13.3.2 The CHAR and VARCHAR Types") values
  as a 1-byte or 2-byte length prefix plus data. The length
  prefix indicates the number of bytes in the value. A
  [`VARCHAR`](char.md "13.3.2 The CHAR and VARCHAR Types") column uses one
  length byte if values require no more than 255 bytes, two
  length bytes if values may require more than 255 bytes.

  Note

  MySQL follows the standard SQL specification, and does
  *not* remove trailing spaces from
  [`VARCHAR`](char.md "13.3.2 The CHAR and VARCHAR Types") values.

  [`VARCHAR`](char.md "13.3.2 The CHAR and VARCHAR Types") is shorthand for
  [`CHARACTER VARYING`](char.md "13.3.2 The CHAR and VARCHAR Types").
  [`NATIONAL VARCHAR`](char.md "13.3.2 The CHAR and VARCHAR Types") is the
  standard SQL way to define that a
  [`VARCHAR`](char.md "13.3.2 The CHAR and VARCHAR Types") column should use
  some predefined character set. MySQL uses
  `utf8mb3` as this predefined character set.
  [Section 12.3.7, “The National Character Set”](charset-national.md "12.3.7 The National Character Set").
  [`NVARCHAR`](char.md "13.3.2 The CHAR and VARCHAR Types") is shorthand for
  [`NATIONAL VARCHAR`](char.md "13.3.2 The CHAR and VARCHAR Types").
- [`BINARY[(M)]`](binary-varbinary.md "13.3.3 The BINARY and VARBINARY Types")

  The [`BINARY`](binary-varbinary.md "13.3.3 The BINARY and VARBINARY Types") type is similar to
  the [`CHAR`](char.md "13.3.2 The CHAR and VARCHAR Types") type, but stores
  binary byte strings rather than nonbinary character strings.
  An optional length *`M`* represents
  the column length in bytes. If omitted,
  *`M`* defaults to 1.
- [`VARBINARY(M)`](binary-varbinary.md "13.3.3 The BINARY and VARBINARY Types")

  The [`VARBINARY`](binary-varbinary.md "13.3.3 The BINARY and VARBINARY Types") type is similar
  to the [`VARCHAR`](char.md "13.3.2 The CHAR and VARCHAR Types") type, but
  stores binary byte strings rather than nonbinary character
  strings. *`M`* represents the maximum
  column length in bytes.
- [`TINYBLOB`](blob.md "13.3.4 The BLOB and TEXT Types")

  A [`BLOB`](blob.md "13.3.4 The BLOB and TEXT Types") column with a maximum
  length of 255 (28 − 1)
  bytes. Each [`TINYBLOB`](blob.md "13.3.4 The BLOB and TEXT Types") value is
  stored using a 1-byte length prefix that indicates the
  number of bytes in the value.
- [`TINYTEXT
  [CHARACTER SET charset_name]
  [COLLATE
  collation_name]`](blob.md "13.3.4 The BLOB and TEXT Types")

  A [`TEXT`](blob.md "13.3.4 The BLOB and TEXT Types") column with a maximum
  length of 255 (28 − 1)
  characters. The effective maximum length is less if the
  value contains multibyte characters. Each
  [`TINYTEXT`](blob.md "13.3.4 The BLOB and TEXT Types") value is stored
  using a 1-byte length prefix that indicates the number of
  bytes in the value.
- [`BLOB[(M)]`](blob.md "13.3.4 The BLOB and TEXT Types")

  A [`BLOB`](blob.md "13.3.4 The BLOB and TEXT Types") column with a maximum
  length of 65,535 (216 − 1)
  bytes. Each [`BLOB`](blob.md "13.3.4 The BLOB and TEXT Types") value is
  stored using a 2-byte length prefix that indicates the
  number of bytes in the value.

  An optional length *`M`* can be given
  for this type. If this is done, MySQL creates the column as
  the smallest [`BLOB`](blob.md "13.3.4 The BLOB and TEXT Types") type large
  enough to hold values *`M`* bytes
  long.
- [`TEXT[(M)]
  [CHARACTER SET charset_name]
  [COLLATE
  collation_name]`](blob.md "13.3.4 The BLOB and TEXT Types")

  A [`TEXT`](blob.md "13.3.4 The BLOB and TEXT Types") column with a maximum
  length of 65,535 (216 − 1)
  bytes. The effective maximum length is less if the
  value contains multibyte characters. Each
  [`TEXT`](blob.md "13.3.4 The BLOB and TEXT Types") value is stored using a
  2-byte length prefix that indicates the number of bytes in
  the value.

  An optional length *`M`* can be given
  for this type. If this is done, MySQL creates the column as
  the smallest [`TEXT`](blob.md "13.3.4 The BLOB and TEXT Types") type large
  enough to hold values *`M`*
  characters long.
- [`MEDIUMBLOB`](blob.md "13.3.4 The BLOB and TEXT Types")

  A [`BLOB`](blob.md "13.3.4 The BLOB and TEXT Types") column with a maximum
  length of 16,777,215 (224 −
  1) bytes. Each [`MEDIUMBLOB`](blob.md "13.3.4 The BLOB and TEXT Types")
  value is stored using a 3-byte length prefix that indicates
  the number of bytes in the value.
- [`MEDIUMTEXT
  [CHARACTER SET charset_name]
  [COLLATE
  collation_name]`](blob.md "13.3.4 The BLOB and TEXT Types")

  A [`TEXT`](blob.md "13.3.4 The BLOB and TEXT Types") column with a maximum
  length of 16,777,215 (224 −
  1) characters. The effective maximum length is less if the
  value contains multibyte characters. Each
  [`MEDIUMTEXT`](blob.md "13.3.4 The BLOB and TEXT Types") value is stored
  using a 3-byte length prefix that indicates the number of
  bytes in the value.
- [`LONGBLOB`](blob.md "13.3.4 The BLOB and TEXT Types")

  A [`BLOB`](blob.md "13.3.4 The BLOB and TEXT Types") column with a maximum
  length of 4,294,967,295 or 4GB
  (232 − 1) bytes. The
  effective maximum length of
  [`LONGBLOB`](blob.md "13.3.4 The BLOB and TEXT Types") columns depends on
  the configured maximum packet size in the client/server
  protocol and available memory. Each
  [`LONGBLOB`](blob.md "13.3.4 The BLOB and TEXT Types") value is stored
  using a 4-byte length prefix that indicates the number of
  bytes in the value.
- [`LONGTEXT
  [CHARACTER SET charset_name]
  [COLLATE
  collation_name]`](blob.md "13.3.4 The BLOB and TEXT Types")

  A [`TEXT`](blob.md "13.3.4 The BLOB and TEXT Types") column with a maximum
  length of 4,294,967,295 or 4GB
  (232 − 1) characters. The
  effective maximum length is less if the value contains
  multibyte characters. The effective maximum length of
  [`LONGTEXT`](blob.md "13.3.4 The BLOB and TEXT Types")
  columns also depends on the configured maximum packet size
  in the client/server protocol and available memory. Each
  [`LONGTEXT`](blob.md "13.3.4 The BLOB and TEXT Types")
  value is stored using a 4-byte length prefix that indicates
  the number of bytes in the value.
- [`ENUM('value1','value2',...)
  [CHARACTER SET charset_name]
  [COLLATE
  collation_name]`](enum.md "13.3.5 The ENUM Type")

  An enumeration. A string object that can have only one
  value, chosen from the list of values
  `'value1'`,
  `'value2'`,
  `...`, `NULL` or the
  special `''` error value.
  [`ENUM`](enum.md "13.3.5 The ENUM Type") values are represented
  internally as integers.

  An [`ENUM`](enum.md "13.3.5 The ENUM Type") column can have a
  maximum of 65,535 distinct elements.

  The maximum supported length of an individual
  `ENUM` element is
  *`M`* <= 255 and
  (*`M`* x
  *`w`*) <= 1020, where
  `M` is the element literal length and
  *`w`* is the number of bytes required
  for the maximum-length character in the character set.
- [`SET('value1','value2',...)
  [CHARACTER SET charset_name]
  [COLLATE
  collation_name]`](set.md "13.3.6 The SET Type")

  A set. A string object that can have zero or more values,
  each of which must be chosen from the list of values
  `'value1'`,
  `'value2'`,
  `...` [`SET`](set.md "13.3.6 The SET Type")
  values are represented internally as integers.

  A [`SET`](set.md "13.3.6 The SET Type") column can have a
  maximum of 64 distinct members.

  The maximum supported length of an individual
  `SET` element is
  *`M`* <= 255 and
  (*`M`* x
  *`w`*) <= 1020, where
  `M` is the element literal length and
  *`w`* is the number of bytes required
  for the maximum-length character in the character set.
