### 15.3.2 Statements That Cannot Be Rolled Back

Some statements cannot be rolled back. In general, these include
data definition language (DDL) statements, such as those that
create or drop databases, those that create, drop, or alter tables
or stored routines.

You should design your transactions not to include such
statements. If you issue a statement early in a transaction that
cannot be rolled back, and then another statement later fails, the
full effect of the transaction cannot be rolled back in such cases
by issuing a
[`ROLLBACK`](commit.md "15.3.1 START TRANSACTION, COMMIT, and ROLLBACK Statements")
statement.
