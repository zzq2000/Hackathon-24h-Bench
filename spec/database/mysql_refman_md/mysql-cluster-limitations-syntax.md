#### 25.2.7.1 Noncompliance with SQL Syntax in NDB Cluster

Some SQL statements relating to certain MySQL features produce
errors when used with [`NDB`](mysql-cluster.md "Chapter 25 MySQL NDB Cluster 8.0") tables,
as described in the following list:

- **Temporary tables.**
  Temporary tables are not supported. Trying either to
  create a temporary table that uses the
  [`NDB`](mysql-cluster.md "Chapter 25 MySQL NDB Cluster 8.0") storage engine or to
  alter an existing temporary table to use
  [`NDB`](mysql-cluster.md "Chapter 25 MySQL NDB Cluster 8.0") fails with the error
  Table storage engine 'ndbcluster' does not
  support the create option 'TEMPORARY'.
- **Indexes and keys in NDB tables.**
  Keys and indexes on NDB Cluster tables are subject to the
  following limitations:

  - **Column width.**
    Attempting to create an index on an
    `NDB` table column whose width is
    greater than 3072 bytes is rejected with
    [`ER_TOO_LONG_KEY`](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/mysql-errors/8.0/en/server-error-reference.html#error_er_too_long_key):
    Specified key was too long; max key length
    is 3072 bytes.

    Attempting to create an index on an
    `NDB` table column whose width is
    greater than 3056 bytes succeeds with a warning. In such
    cases, statistical information is not generated, which
    means a nonoptimal execution plan may be selected. For
    this reason, you should consider making the index length
    shorter than 3056 bytes if possible.
  - **TEXT and BLOB columns.**
    You cannot create indexes on
    [`NDB`](mysql-cluster.md "Chapter 25 MySQL NDB Cluster 8.0") table columns that
    use any of the [`TEXT`](blob.md "13.3.4 The BLOB and TEXT Types") or
    [`BLOB`](blob.md "13.3.4 The BLOB and TEXT Types") data types.
  - **FULLTEXT indexes.**
    The [`NDB`](mysql-cluster.md "Chapter 25 MySQL NDB Cluster 8.0") storage engine
    does not support `FULLTEXT` indexes,
    which are possible for
    [`MyISAM`](myisam-storage-engine.md "18.2 The MyISAM Storage Engine") and
    [`InnoDB`](innodb-storage-engine.md "Chapter 17 The InnoDB Storage Engine") tables only.

    However, you can create indexes on
    [`VARCHAR`](char.md "13.3.2 The CHAR and VARCHAR Types") columns of
    [`NDB`](mysql-cluster.md "Chapter 25 MySQL NDB Cluster 8.0") tables.
  - **USING HASH keys and NULL.**
    Using nullable columns in unique keys and primary keys
    means that queries using these columns are handled as
    full table scans. To work around this issue, make the
    column `NOT NULL`, or re-create the
    index without the `USING HASH`
    option.
  - **Prefixes.**
    There are no prefix indexes; only entire columns can
    be indexed. (The size of an `NDB`
    column index is always the same as the width of the
    column in bytes, up to and including 3072 bytes, as
    described earlier in this section. Also see
    [Section 25.2.7.6, “Unsupported or Missing Features in NDB Cluster”](mysql-cluster-limitations-unsupported.md "25.2.7.6 Unsupported or Missing Features in NDB Cluster"),
    for additional information.)
  - **BIT columns.**
    A [`BIT`](bit-type.md "13.1.5 Bit-Value Type - BIT") column cannot be
    a primary key, unique key, or index, nor can it be
    part of a composite primary key, unique key, or index.
  - **AUTO\_INCREMENT columns.**
    Like other MySQL storage engines, the
    [`NDB`](mysql-cluster.md "Chapter 25 MySQL NDB Cluster 8.0") storage engine can
    handle a maximum of one
    `AUTO_INCREMENT` column per table,
    and this column must be indexed. However, in the case
    of an NDB table with no explicit primary key, an
    `AUTO_INCREMENT` column is
    automatically defined and used as a
    “hidden” primary key. For this reason,
    you cannot create an `NDB` table
    having an `AUTO_INCREMENT` column and
    no explicit primary key.

    The following [`CREATE
    TABLE`](create-table.md "15.1.20 CREATE TABLE Statement") statements do not work, as shown here:

    ```sql
    # No index on AUTO_INCREMENT column; table has no primary key
    # Raises ER_WRONG_AUTO_KEY
    mysql> CREATE TABLE n (
        ->     a INT,
        ->     b INT AUTO_INCREMENT
        ->     )
        -> ENGINE=NDB;
    ERROR 1075 (42000): Incorrect table definition; there can be only one auto
    column and it must be defined as a key

    # Index on AUTO_INCREMENT column; table has no primary key
    # Raises NDB error 4335
    mysql> CREATE TABLE n (
        ->     a INT,
        ->     b INT AUTO_INCREMENT,
        ->     KEY k (b)
        ->     )
        -> ENGINE=NDB;
    ERROR 1296 (HY000): Got error 4335 'Only one autoincrement column allowed per
    table. Having a table without primary key uses an autoincr' from NDBCLUSTER
    ```

    The following statement creates a table with a primary
    key, an `AUTO_INCREMENT` column, and an
    index on this column, and succeeds:

    ```sql
    # Index on AUTO_INCREMENT column; table has a primary key
    mysql> CREATE TABLE n (
        ->     a INT PRIMARY KEY,
        ->     b INT AUTO_INCREMENT,
        ->     KEY k (b)
        ->     )
        -> ENGINE=NDB;
    Query OK, 0 rows affected (0.38 sec)
    ```
- **Restrictions on foreign keys.**
  Support for foreign key constraints in NDB
  8.0 is comparable to that provided by
  [`InnoDB`](innodb-storage-engine.md "Chapter 17 The InnoDB Storage Engine"), subject to the
  following restrictions:

  - Every column referenced as a foreign key requires an
    explicit unique key, if it is not the table's
    primary key.
  - `ON UPDATE CASCADE` is not supported
    when the reference is to the parent table's primary
    key.

    This is because an update of a primary key is
    implemented as a delete of the old row (containing the
    old primary key) plus an insert of the new row (with a
    new primary key). This is not visible to the
    `NDB` kernel, which views these two
    rows as being the same, and thus has no way of knowing
    that this update should be cascaded.
  - `ON DELETE CASCADE` is also not
    supported where the child table contains one or more
    columns of any of the
    [`TEXT`](blob.md "13.3.4 The BLOB and TEXT Types") or
    [`BLOB`](blob.md "13.3.4 The BLOB and TEXT Types") types. (Bug #89511,
    Bug #27484882)
  - `SET DEFAULT` is not supported. (Also
    not supported by [`InnoDB`](innodb-storage-engine.md "Chapter 17 The InnoDB Storage Engine").)
  - The `NO ACTION` keyword is accepted but
    treated as `RESTRICT`. `NO
    ACTION`, which is a standard SQL keyword, is
    the default in MySQL 8.0. (Also the same as
    with `InnoDB`.)
  - In earlier versions of NDB Cluster, when creating a
    table with foreign key referencing an index in another
    table, it sometimes appeared possible to create the
    foreign key even if the order of the columns in the
    indexes did not match, due to the fact that an
    appropriate error was not always returned internally. A
    partial fix for this issue improved the error used
    internally to work in most cases; however, it remains
    possible for this situation to occur in the event that
    the parent index is a unique index. (Bug #18094360)

  For more information, see
  [Section 15.1.20.5, “FOREIGN KEY Constraints”](create-table-foreign-keys.md "15.1.20.5 FOREIGN KEY Constraints"), and
  [Section 1.6.3.2, “FOREIGN KEY Constraints”](constraint-foreign-key.md "1.6.3.2 FOREIGN KEY Constraints").
- **NDB Cluster and geometry data types.**
  Geometry data types (`WKT` and
  `WKB`) are supported for
  [`NDB`](mysql-cluster.md "Chapter 25 MySQL NDB Cluster 8.0") tables. However, spatial
  indexes are not supported.
- **Character sets and binary log files.**
  Currently, the `ndb_apply_status` and
  `ndb_binlog_index` tables are created
  using the `latin1` (ASCII) character set.
  Because names of binary logs are recorded in this table,
  binary log files named using non-Latin characters are not
  referenced correctly in these tables. This is a known
  issue, which we are working to fix. (Bug #50226)

  To work around this problem, use only Latin-1 characters
  when naming binary log files or setting any the
  [`--basedir`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_basedir),
  [`--log-bin`](replication-options-binary-log.md#option_mysqld_log-bin), or
  [`--log-bin-index`](replication-options-binary-log.md#option_mysqld_log-bin-index) options.
- **Creating NDB tables with user-defined partitioning.**

  Support for user-defined partitioning in NDB Cluster is
  restricted to [`LINEAR`]
  `KEY` partitioning. Using any other
  partitioning type with `ENGINE=NDB` or
  `ENGINE=NDBCLUSTER` in a
  [`CREATE TABLE`](create-table.md "15.1.20 CREATE TABLE Statement") statement
  results in an error.

  It is possible to override this restriction, but doing so is
  not supported for use in production settings. For details,
  see [User-defined partitioning and the NDB storage engine (NDB Cluster)](partitioning-limitations-storage-engines.md#partitioning-limitations-ndb "User-defined partitioning and the NDB storage engine (NDB Cluster)").

  **Default partitioning scheme.**
  All NDB Cluster tables are by default partitioned by
  `KEY` using the table's primary key
  as the partitioning key. If no primary key is explicitly
  set for the table, the “hidden” primary key
  automatically created by the
  [`NDB`](mysql-cluster.md "Chapter 25 MySQL NDB Cluster 8.0") storage engine is used
  instead. For additional discussion of these and related
  issues, see [Section 26.2.5, “KEY Partitioning”](partitioning-key.md "26.2.5 KEY Partitioning").

  [`CREATE TABLE`](create-table.md "15.1.20 CREATE TABLE Statement") and
  [`ALTER TABLE`](alter-table.md "15.1.9 ALTER TABLE Statement") statements that
  would cause a user-partitioned
  [`NDBCLUSTER`](mysql-cluster.md "Chapter 25 MySQL NDB Cluster 8.0") table not to meet
  either or both of the following two requirements are not
  permitted, and fail with an error:

  1. The table must have an explicit primary key.
  2. All columns listed in the table's partitioning
     expression must be part of the primary key.

  **Exception.**
  If a user-partitioned
  [`NDBCLUSTER`](mysql-cluster.md "Chapter 25 MySQL NDB Cluster 8.0") table is created
  using an empty column-list (that is, using
  `PARTITION BY [LINEAR] KEY()`), then no
  explicit primary key is required.

  **Maximum number of partitions for NDBCLUSTER tables.**
  The maximum number of partitions that can defined for a
  [`NDBCLUSTER`](mysql-cluster.md "Chapter 25 MySQL NDB Cluster 8.0") table when
  employing user-defined partitioning is 8 per node group.
  (See [Section 25.2.2, “NDB Cluster Nodes, Node Groups, Fragment Replicas, and Partitions”](mysql-cluster-nodes-groups.md "25.2.2 NDB Cluster Nodes, Node Groups, Fragment Replicas, and Partitions"), for
  more information about NDB Cluster node groups.

  **DROP PARTITION not supported.**
  It is not possible to drop partitions from
  [`NDB`](mysql-cluster.md "Chapter 25 MySQL NDB Cluster 8.0") tables using
  `ALTER TABLE ... DROP PARTITION`. The
  other partitioning extensions to
  [`ALTER
  TABLE`](alter-table.md "15.1.9 ALTER TABLE Statement")—`ADD PARTITION`,
  `REORGANIZE PARTITION`, and
  `COALESCE PARTITION`—are supported
  for NDB tables, but use copying and so are not optimized.
  See [Section 26.3.1, “Management of RANGE and LIST Partitions”](partitioning-management-range-list.md "26.3.1 Management of RANGE and LIST Partitions")
  and [Section 15.1.9, “ALTER TABLE Statement”](alter-table.md "15.1.9 ALTER TABLE Statement").

  **Partition selection.**
  Partition selection is not supported for
  `NDB` tables. See
  [Section 26.5, “Partition Selection”](partitioning-selection.md "26.5 Partition Selection"), for more
  information.
- **JSON data type.**
  The MySQL [`JSON`](json.md "13.5 The JSON Data Type") data type is
  supported for `NDB` tables in the
  [**mysqld**](mysqld.md "6.3.1 mysqld — The MySQL Server") supplied with NDB
  8.0.

  An `NDB` table can have a maximum of 3
  `JSON` columns.

  The NDB API has no special provision for working with
  `JSON` data, which it views simply as
  `BLOB` data. Handling data as
  `JSON` must be performed by the
  application.
- **DEFAULT value expressions.**
  Explicit default value expressions (as implemented in
  MySQL 8.0.34 and later) for `NDB` table
  column definitions are not supported. This means that, for
  example, the following [`CREATE
  TABLE`](create-table.md "15.1.20 CREATE TABLE Statement") statement is rejected with an error:

  ```sql
  mysql> CREATE TABLE t (
      ->   id INT NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
      ->   cf FLOAT DEFAULT (RAND() * 10)
      -> ) ENGINE=NDBCLUSTER;
  ERROR 3774 (HY000): 'Specified storage engine' is not supported for default value expressions.
  ```

  NDB Cluster does support literal default column values, as
  shown here:

  ```sql
  mysql> CREATE TABLE t3 (
      ->   id INT NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
      ->   ci INT DEFAULT 0,
      ->   cv VARCHAR(20) DEFAULT ''
      -> ) ENGINE=NDBCLUSTER;
  Query OK, 0 rows affected (0.17 sec)
  ```

  For more information, see
  [Section 13.6, “Data Type Default Values”](data-type-defaults.md "13.6 Data Type Default Values").
