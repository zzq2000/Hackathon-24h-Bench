#### 9.4.5.5 Using mysqldump to Test for Upgrade Incompatibilities

When contemplating a MySQL upgrade, it is prudent to install
the newer version separately from your current production
version. Then you can dump the database and database object
definitions from the production server and load them into the
new server to verify that they are handled properly. (This is
also useful for testing downgrades.)

On the production server:

```terminal
$> mysqldump --all-databases --no-data --routines --events > dump-defs.sql
```

On the upgraded server:

```terminal
$> mysql < dump-defs.sql
```

Because the dump file does not contain table data, it can be
processed quickly. This enables you to spot potential
incompatibilities without waiting for lengthy data-loading
operations. Look for warnings or errors while the dump file is
being processed.

After you have verified that the definitions are handled
properly, dump the data and try to load it into the upgraded
server.

On the production server:

```terminal
$> mysqldump --all-databases --no-create-info > dump-data.sql
```

On the upgraded server:

```terminal
$> mysql < dump-data.sql
```

Now check the table contents and run some test queries.
