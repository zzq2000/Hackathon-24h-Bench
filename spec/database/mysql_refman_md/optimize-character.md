#### 10.4.2.2 Optimizing for Character and String Types

For character and string columns, follow these guidelines:

- Use binary collation order for fast comparison and sort
  operations, when you do not need language-specific
  collation features. You can use the
  [`BINARY`](cast-functions.md#operator_binary) operator to use binary
  collation within a particular query.
- When comparing values from different columns, declare
  those columns with the same character set and collation
  wherever possible, to avoid string conversions while
  running the query.
- For column values less than 8KB in size, use binary
  `VARCHAR` instead of
  `BLOB`. The `GROUP BY`
  and `ORDER BY` clauses can generate
  temporary tables, and these temporary tables can use the
  `MEMORY` storage engine if the original
  table does not contain any `BLOB`
  columns.
- If a table contains string columns such as name and
  address, but many queries do not retrieve those columns,
  consider splitting the string columns into a separate
  table and using join queries with a foreign key when
  necessary. When MySQL retrieves any value from a row, it
  reads a data block containing all the columns of that row
  (and possibly other adjacent rows). Keeping each row
  small, with only the most frequently used columns, allows
  more rows to fit in each data block. Such compact tables
  reduce disk I/O and memory usage for common queries.
- When you use a randomly generated value as a primary key
  in an `InnoDB` table, prefix it with an
  ascending value such as the current date and time if
  possible. When consecutive primary values are physically
  stored near each other, `InnoDB` can
  insert and retrieve them faster.
- See [Section 10.4.2.1, “Optimizing for Numeric Data”](optimize-numeric.md "10.4.2.1 Optimizing for Numeric Data") for reasons why a
  numeric column is usually preferable to an equivalent
  string column.
