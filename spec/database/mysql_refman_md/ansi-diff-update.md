#### 1.6.2.2 UPDATE Differences

If you access a column from the table to be updated in an
expression, [`UPDATE`](update.md "15.2.17 UPDATE Statement") uses the
current value of the column. The second assignment in the
following statement sets `col2` to the
current (updated) `col1` value, not the
original `col1` value. The result is that
`col1` and `col2` have the
same value. This behavior differs from standard SQL.

```sql
UPDATE t1 SET col1 = col1 + 1, col2 = col1;
```
