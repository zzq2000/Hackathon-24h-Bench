#### 10.10.2.1 Shared Key Cache Access

Threads can access key cache buffers simultaneously, subject
to the following conditions:

- A buffer that is not being updated can be accessed by
  multiple sessions.
- A buffer that is being updated causes sessions that need
  to use it to wait until the update is complete.
- Multiple sessions can initiate requests that result in
  cache block replacements, as long as they do not interfere
  with each other (that is, as long as they need different
  index blocks, and thus cause different cache blocks to be
  replaced).

Shared access to the key cache enables the server to improve
throughput significantly.
