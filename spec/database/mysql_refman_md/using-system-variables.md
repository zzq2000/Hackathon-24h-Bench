The MySQL server maintains many system variables that configure
its operation. [Section 7.1.8, “Server System Variables”](server-system-variables.md "7.1.8 Server System Variables"),
describes the meaning of these variables. Each system variable has
a default value. System variables can be set at server startup
using options on the command line or in an option file. Most of
them can be changed dynamically while the server is running by
means of the
[`SET`](set-variable.md "15.7.6.1 SET Syntax for Variable Assignment")
statement, which enables you to modify operation of the server
without having to stop and restart it. You can also use system
variable values in expressions.

Many system variables are built in. System variables may also be
installed by server plugins or components:

- System variables implemented by a server plugin are exposed
  when the plugin is installed and have names that begin with
  the plugin name. For example, the `audit_log`
  plugin implements a system variable named
  [`audit_log_policy`](audit-log-reference.md#sysvar_audit_log_policy).
- System variables implemented by a component are exposed when
  the component is installed and have names that begin with a
  component-specific prefix. For example, the
  `log_filter_dragnet` error log filter
  component implements a system variable named
  `log_error_filter_rules`, the full name of
  which is
  [`dragnet.log_error_filter_rules`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_dragnet.log_error_filter_rules).
  To refer to this variable, use the full name.

There are two scopes in which system variables exist. Global
variables affect the overall operation of the server. Session
variables affect its operation for individual client connections.
A given system variable can have both a global and a session
value. Global and session system variables are related as follows:

- When the server starts, it initializes each global variable to
  its default value. These defaults can be changed by options
  specified on the command line or in an option file. (See
  [Section 6.2.2, “Specifying Program Options”](program-options.md "6.2.2 Specifying Program Options").)
- The server also maintains a set of session variables for each
  client that connects. The client's session variables are
  initialized at connect time using the current values of the
  corresponding global variables. For example, a client's SQL
  mode is controlled by the session
  [`sql_mode`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_sql_mode) value, which is
  initialized when the client connects to the value of the
  global [`sql_mode`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_sql_mode) value.

  For some system variables, the session value is not
  initialized from the corresponding global value; if so, that
  is indicated in the variable description.

System variable values can be set globally at server startup by
using options on the command line or in an option file. At
startup, the syntax for system variables is the same as for
command options, so within variable names, dashes and underscores
may be used interchangeably. For example,
[`--general_log=ON`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_general_log) and
[`--general-log=ON`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_general_log) are equivalent.

When you use a startup option to set a variable that takes a
numeric value, the value can be given with a suffix of
`K`, `M`, or
`G` (either uppercase or lowercase) to indicate a
multiplier of 1024, 10242 or
10243; that is, units of kilobytes,
megabytes, or gigabytes, respectively. As of MySQL 8.0.14, a
suffix can also be `T`, `P`, and
`E` to indicate a multiplier of
10244, 10245
or 10246. Thus, the following command
starts the server with a sort buffer size of 256 kilobytes and a
maximum packet size of one gigabyte:

```terminal
mysqld --sort-buffer-size=256K --max-allowed-packet=1G
```

Within an option file, those variables are set like this:

```ini
[mysqld]
sort_buffer_size=256K
max_allowed_packet=1G
```

The lettercase of suffix letters does not matter;
`256K` and `256k` are
equivalent, as are `1G` and
`1g`.

To restrict the maximum value to which a system variable can be
set at runtime with the
[`SET`](set-variable.md "15.7.6.1 SET Syntax for Variable Assignment")
statement, specify this maximum by using an option of the form
`--maximum-var_name=value`
at server startup. For example, to prevent the value of
[`sort_buffer_size`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_sort_buffer_size) from being
increased to more than 32MB at runtime, use the option
`--maximum-sort-buffer-size=32M`.

Many system variables are dynamic and can be changed at runtime by
using the
[`SET`](set-variable.md "15.7.6.1 SET Syntax for Variable Assignment")
statement. For a list, see
[Section 7.1.9.2, “Dynamic System Variables”](dynamic-system-variables.md "7.1.9.2 Dynamic System Variables"). To change a system
variable with
[`SET`](set-variable.md "15.7.6.1 SET Syntax for Variable Assignment"), refer
to it by name, optionally preceded by a modifier. At runtime,
system variable names must be written using underscores, not
dashes. The following examples briefly illustrate this syntax:

- Set a global system variable:

  ```sql
  SET GLOBAL max_connections = 1000;
  SET @@GLOBAL.max_connections = 1000;
  ```
- Persist a global system variable to the
  `mysqld-auto.cnf` file (and set the runtime
  value):

  ```sql
  SET PERSIST max_connections = 1000;
  SET @@PERSIST.max_connections = 1000;
  ```
- Persist a global system variable to the
  `mysqld-auto.cnf` file (without setting the
  runtime value):

  ```sql
  SET PERSIST_ONLY back_log = 1000;
  SET @@PERSIST_ONLY.back_log = 1000;
  ```
- Set a session system variable:

  ```sql
  SET SESSION sql_mode = 'TRADITIONAL';
  SET @@SESSION.sql_mode = 'TRADITIONAL';
  SET @@sql_mode = 'TRADITIONAL';
  ```

For complete details about
[`SET`](set-variable.md "15.7.6.1 SET Syntax for Variable Assignment")
syntax, see [Section 15.7.6.1, “SET Syntax for Variable Assignment”](set-variable.md "15.7.6.1 SET Syntax for Variable Assignment"). For a description of
the privilege requirements for setting and persisting system
variables, see [Section 7.1.9.1, “System Variable Privileges”](system-variable-privileges.md "7.1.9.1 System Variable Privileges")

Suffixes for specifying a value multiplier can be used when
setting a variable at server startup, but not to set the value
with [`SET`](set-variable.md "15.7.6.1 SET Syntax for Variable Assignment")
at runtime. On the other hand, with
[`SET`](set-variable.md "15.7.6.1 SET Syntax for Variable Assignment") you
can assign a variable's value using an expression, which is not
true when you set a variable at server startup. For example, the
first of the following lines is legal at server startup, but the
second is not:

```terminal
$> mysql --max_allowed_packet=16M
$> mysql --max_allowed_packet=16*1024*1024
```

Conversely, the second of the following lines is legal at runtime,
but the first is not:

```terminal
mysql> SET GLOBAL max_allowed_packet=16M;
mysql> SET GLOBAL max_allowed_packet=16*1024*1024;
```

To display system variable names and values, use the
[`SHOW VARIABLES`](show-variables.md "15.7.7.41 SHOW VARIABLES Statement") statement:

```sql

```

With a [`LIKE`](string-comparison-functions.md#operator_like) clause, the statement
displays only those variables that match the pattern. To obtain a
specific variable name, use a [`LIKE`](string-comparison-functions.md#operator_like)
clause as shown:

```sql
SHOW VARIABLES LIKE 'max_join_size';
SHOW SESSION VARIABLES LIKE 'max_join_size';
```

To get a list of variables whose name match a pattern, use the
`%` wildcard character in a
[`LIKE`](string-comparison-functions.md#operator_like) clause:

```sql
SHOW VARIABLES LIKE '%size%';
SHOW GLOBAL VARIABLES LIKE '%size%';
```

Wildcard characters can be used in any position within the pattern
to be matched. Strictly speaking, because `_` is
a wildcard that matches any single character, you should escape it
as `\_` to match it literally. In practice, this
is rarely necessary.

For [`SHOW VARIABLES`](show-variables.md "15.7.7.41 SHOW VARIABLES Statement"), if you specify
neither `GLOBAL` nor `SESSION`,
MySQL returns `SESSION` values.

The reason for requiring the `GLOBAL` keyword
when setting `GLOBAL`-only variables but not when
retrieving them is to prevent problems in the future:

- Were a `SESSION` variable to be removed that
  has the same name as a `GLOBAL` variable, a
  client with privileges sufficient to modify global variables
  might accidentally change the `GLOBAL`
  variable rather than just the `SESSION`
  variable for its own session.
- Were a `SESSION` variable to be added with
  the same name as a `GLOBAL` variable, a
  client that intends to change the `GLOBAL`
  variable might find only its own `SESSION`
  variable changed.
