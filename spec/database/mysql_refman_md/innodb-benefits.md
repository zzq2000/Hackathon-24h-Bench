### 17.1.1 Benefits of Using InnoDB Tables

`InnoDB` tables have the following benefits:

- If the server unexpectedly exits because of a hardware or
  software issue, regardless of what was happening in the
  database at the time, you don't need to do anything special
  after restarting the database. `InnoDB` crash
  recovery automatically finalizes changes that were committed
  before the time of the crash, and undoes changes that were in
  process but not committed, permitting you to restart and
  continue from where you left off. See
  [Section 17.18.2, “InnoDB Recovery”](innodb-recovery.md "17.18.2 InnoDB Recovery").
- The `InnoDB` storage engine maintains its own
  buffer pool that caches table and index data in main memory as
  data is accessed. Frequently used data is processed directly
  from memory. This cache applies to many types of information
  and speeds up processing. On dedicated database servers, up to
  80% of physical memory is often assigned to the buffer pool.
  See [Section 17.5.1, “Buffer Pool”](innodb-buffer-pool.md "17.5.1 Buffer Pool").
- If you split up related data into different tables, you can
  set up foreign keys that enforce referential integrity. See
  [Section 15.1.20.5, “FOREIGN KEY Constraints”](create-table-foreign-keys.md "15.1.20.5 FOREIGN KEY Constraints").
- If data becomes corrupted on disk or in memory, a checksum
  mechanism alerts you to the bogus data before you use it. The
  [`innodb_checksum_algorithm`](innodb-parameters.md#sysvar_innodb_checksum_algorithm)
  variable defines the checksum algorithm used by
  `InnoDB`.
- When you design a database with appropriate primary key
  columns for each table, operations involving those columns are
  automatically optimized. It is very fast to reference the
  primary key columns in
  [`WHERE`](select.md "15.2.13 SELECT Statement")
  clauses, [`ORDER
  BY`](select.md "15.2.13 SELECT Statement") clauses,
  [`GROUP BY`](select.md "15.2.13 SELECT Statement")
  clauses, and join operations. See
  [Section 17.6.2.1, “Clustered and Secondary Indexes”](innodb-index-types.md "17.6.2.1 Clustered and Secondary Indexes").
- Inserts, updates, and deletes are optimized by an automatic
  mechanism called change buffering. `InnoDB`
  not only allows concurrent read and write access to the same
  table, it caches changed data to streamline disk I/O. See
  [Section 17.5.2, “Change Buffer”](innodb-change-buffer.md "17.5.2 Change Buffer").
- Performance benefits are not limited to large tables with
  long-running queries. When the same rows are accessed over and
  over from a table, the Adaptive Hash Index takes over to make
  these lookups even faster, as if they came out of a hash
  table. See [Section 17.5.3, “Adaptive Hash Index”](innodb-adaptive-hash.md "17.5.3 Adaptive Hash Index").
- You can compress tables and associated indexes. See
  [Section 17.9, “InnoDB Table and Page Compression”](innodb-compression.md "17.9 InnoDB Table and Page Compression").
- You can encrypt your data. See
  [Section 17.13, “InnoDB Data-at-Rest Encryption”](innodb-data-encryption.md "17.13 InnoDB Data-at-Rest Encryption").
- You can create and drop indexes and perform other DDL
  operations with much less impact on performance and
  availability. See
  [Section 17.12.1, “Online DDL Operations”](innodb-online-ddl-operations.md "17.12.1 Online DDL Operations").
- Truncating a file-per-table tablespace is very fast and can
  free up disk space for the operating system to reuse rather
  than only `InnoDB`. See
  [Section 17.6.3.2, “File-Per-Table Tablespaces”](innodb-file-per-table-tablespaces.md "17.6.3.2 File-Per-Table Tablespaces").
- The storage layout for table data is more efficient for
  [`BLOB`](blob.md "13.3.4 The BLOB and TEXT Types") and long text fields, with
  the `DYNAMIC` row format. See
  [Section 17.10, “InnoDB Row Formats”](innodb-row-format.md "17.10 InnoDB Row Formats").
- You can monitor the internal workings of the storage engine by
  querying `INFORMATION_SCHEMA` tables. See
  [Section 17.15, “InnoDB INFORMATION\_SCHEMA Tables”](innodb-information-schema.md "17.15 InnoDB INFORMATION_SCHEMA Tables").
- You can monitor the performance details of the storage engine
  by querying Performance Schema tables. See
  [Section 17.16, “InnoDB Integration with MySQL Performance Schema”](innodb-performance-schema.md "17.16 InnoDB Integration with MySQL Performance Schema").
- You can mix `InnoDB` tables with tables from
  other MySQL storage engines, even within the same statement.
  For example, you can use a join operation to combine data from
  `InnoDB` and
  [`MEMORY`](memory-storage-engine.md "18.3 The MEMORY Storage Engine") tables in a single query.
- `InnoDB` has been designed for CPU efficiency
  and maximum performance when processing large data volumes.
- `InnoDB` tables can handle large quantities
  of data, even on operating systems where file size is limited
  to 2GB.

For `InnoDB`-specific tuning techniques you can
apply to your MySQL server and application code, see
[Section 10.5, “Optimizing for InnoDB Tables”](optimizing-innodb.md "10.5 Optimizing for InnoDB Tables").
