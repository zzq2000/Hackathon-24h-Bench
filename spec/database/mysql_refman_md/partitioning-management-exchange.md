### 26.3.3 Exchanging Partitions and Subpartitions with Tables

In MySQL 8.0, it is possible to exchange a table
partition or subpartition with a table using `ALTER
TABLE pt EXCHANGE PARTITION
p WITH TABLE
nt`, where
*`pt`* is the partitioned table and
*`p`* is the partition or subpartition of
*`pt`* to be exchanged with unpartitioned
table *`nt`*, provided that the following
statements are true:

1. Table *`nt`* is not itself
   partitioned.
2. Table *`nt`* is not a temporary
   table.
3. The structures of tables *`pt`* and
   *`nt`* are otherwise identical.
4. Table `nt` contains no foreign key
   references, and no other table has any foreign keys that
   refer to `nt`.
5. There are no rows in *`nt`* that lie
   outside the boundaries of the partition definition for
   *`p`*. This condition does not apply
   if `WITHOUT VALIDATION` is used.
6. Both tables must use the same character set and collation.
7. For `InnoDB` tables, both tables must use
   the same row format. To determine the row format of an
   `InnoDB` table, query
   [`INFORMATION_SCHEMA.INNODB_TABLES`](information-schema-innodb-tables-table.md "28.4.23 The INFORMATION_SCHEMA INNODB_TABLES Table").
8. Any partition-level `MAX_ROWS` setting for
   `p` must be the same as the table-level
   `MAX_ROWS` value set for
   `nt`. The setting for any partition-level
   `MIN_ROWS` setting for `p`
   must also be the same any table-level
   `MIN_ROWS` value set for
   `nt`.

   This is true in either case whether not
   `pt` has an explicit table-level
   `MAX_ROWS` or `MIN_ROWS`
   option in effect.
9. The `AVG_ROW_LENGTH` cannot differ between
   the two tables `pt` and
   `nt`.
10. `pt` does not have any partitions that use
    the `DATA DIRECTORY` option. This
    restriction is lifted for `InnoDB` tables
    in MySQL 8.0.14 and later.
11. `INDEX DIRECTORY` cannot differ between the
    table and the partition to be exchanged with it.
12. No table or partition `TABLESPACE` options
    can be used in either of the tables.

In addition to the [`ALTER`](privileges-provided.md#priv_alter),
[`INSERT`](privileges-provided.md#priv_insert), and
[`CREATE`](privileges-provided.md#priv_create) privileges usually
required for [`ALTER TABLE`](alter-table.md "15.1.9 ALTER TABLE Statement")
statements, you must have the
[`DROP`](privileges-provided.md#priv_drop) privilege to perform
[`ALTER TABLE ...
EXCHANGE PARTITION`](alter-table.md "15.1.9 ALTER TABLE Statement").

You should also be aware of the following effects of
[`ALTER TABLE ...
EXCHANGE PARTITION`](alter-table.md "15.1.9 ALTER TABLE Statement"):

- Executing [`ALTER
  TABLE ... EXCHANGE PARTITION`](alter-table.md "15.1.9 ALTER TABLE Statement") does not invoke any
  triggers on either the partitioned table or the table to be
  exchanged.
- Any `AUTO_INCREMENT` columns in the
  exchanged table are reset.
- The `IGNORE` keyword has no effect when
  used with `ALTER TABLE ... EXCHANGE
  PARTITION`.

The syntax for
[`ALTER TABLE ...
EXCHANGE PARTITION`](alter-table.md "15.1.9 ALTER TABLE Statement") is shown here, where
*`pt`* is the partitioned table,
*`p`* is the partition (or subpartition)
to be exchanged, and *`nt`* is the
nonpartitioned table to be exchanged with
*`p`*:

```sql
ALTER TABLE pt
    EXCHANGE PARTITION p
    WITH TABLE nt;
```

Optionally, you can append `WITH VALIDATION` or
`WITHOUT VALIDATION`. When `WITHOUT
VALIDATION` is specified, the
[`ALTER TABLE ...
EXCHANGE PARTITION`](alter-table.md "15.1.9 ALTER TABLE Statement") operation does not perform any
row-by-row validation when exchanging a partition a
nonpartitioned table, allowing database administrators to assume
responsibility for ensuring that rows are within the boundaries
of the partition definition. `WITH VALIDATION`
is the default.

One and only one partition or subpartition may be exchanged with
one and only one nonpartitioned table in a single
[`ALTER TABLE
EXCHANGE PARTITION`](alter-table.md "15.1.9 ALTER TABLE Statement") statement. To exchange multiple
partitions or subpartitions, use multiple
[`ALTER TABLE
EXCHANGE PARTITION`](alter-table.md "15.1.9 ALTER TABLE Statement") statements. `EXCHANGE
PARTITION` may not be combined with other
[`ALTER TABLE`](alter-table.md "15.1.9 ALTER TABLE Statement") options. The
partitioning and (if applicable) subpartitioning used by the
partitioned table may be of any type or types supported in MySQL
8.0.

#### Exchanging a Partition with a Nonpartitioned Table

Suppose that a partitioned table `e` has been
created and populated using the following SQL statements:

```sql
CREATE TABLE e (
    id INT NOT NULL,
    fname VARCHAR(30),
    lname VARCHAR(30)
)
    PARTITION BY RANGE (id) (
        PARTITION p0 VALUES LESS THAN (50),
        PARTITION p1 VALUES LESS THAN (100),
        PARTITION p2 VALUES LESS THAN (150),
        PARTITION p3 VALUES LESS THAN (MAXVALUE)
);

INSERT INTO e VALUES
    (1669, "Jim", "Smith"),
    (337, "Mary", "Jones"),
    (16, "Frank", "White"),
    (2005, "Linda", "Black");
```

Now we create a nonpartitioned copy of `e`
named `e2`. This can be done using the
[**mysql**](mysql.md "6.5.1 mysql — The MySQL Command-Line Client") client as shown here:

```sql
mysql> CREATE TABLE e2 LIKE e;
Query OK, 0 rows affected (0.04 sec)

mysql> ALTER TABLE e2 REMOVE PARTITIONING;
Query OK, 0 rows affected (0.07 sec)
Records: 0  Duplicates: 0  Warnings: 0
```

You can see which partitions in table `e`
contain rows by querying the Information Schema
[`PARTITIONS`](information-schema-partitions-table.md "28.3.21 The INFORMATION_SCHEMA PARTITIONS Table") table, like this:

```sql
mysql> SELECT PARTITION_NAME, TABLE_ROWS
           FROM INFORMATION_SCHEMA.PARTITIONS
           WHERE TABLE_NAME = 'e';
+----------------+------------+
| PARTITION_NAME | TABLE_ROWS |
+----------------+------------+
| p0             |          1 |
| p1             |          0 |
| p2             |          0 |
| p3             |          3 |
+----------------+------------+
2 rows in set (0.00 sec)
```

Note

For partitioned `InnoDB` tables, the row
count given in the `TABLE_ROWS` column of the
Information Schema [`PARTITIONS`](information-schema-partitions-table.md "28.3.21 The INFORMATION_SCHEMA PARTITIONS Table")
table is only an estimated value used in SQL optimization, and
is not always exact.

To exchange partition `p0` in table
`e` with table `e2`, you can
use
[`ALTER
TABLE`](alter-table-partition-operations.md "15.1.9.1 ALTER TABLE Partition Operations"), as shown here:

```sql
mysql> ALTER TABLE e EXCHANGE PARTITION p0 WITH TABLE e2;
Query OK, 0 rows affected (0.04 sec)
```

More precisely, the statement just issued causes any rows found
in the partition to be swapped with those found in the table.
You can observe how this has happened by querying the
Information Schema [`PARTITIONS`](information-schema-partitions-table.md "28.3.21 The INFORMATION_SCHEMA PARTITIONS Table")
table, as before. The table row that was previously found in
partition `p0` is no longer present:

```sql
mysql> SELECT PARTITION_NAME, TABLE_ROWS
           FROM INFORMATION_SCHEMA.PARTITIONS
           WHERE TABLE_NAME = 'e';
+----------------+------------+
| PARTITION_NAME | TABLE_ROWS |
+----------------+------------+
| p0             |          0 |
| p1             |          0 |
| p2             |          0 |
| p3             |          3 |
+----------------+------------+
4 rows in set (0.00 sec)
```

If you query table `e2`, you can see that the
“missing” row can now be found there:

```sql
mysql> SELECT * FROM e2;
+----+-------+-------+
| id | fname | lname |
+----+-------+-------+
| 16 | Frank | White |
+----+-------+-------+
1 row in set (0.00 sec)
```

The table to be exchanged with the partition does not
necessarily have to be empty. To demonstrate this, we first
insert a new row into table `e`, making sure
that this row is stored in partition `p0` by
choosing an `id` column value that is less than
50, and verifying this afterward by querying the
[`PARTITIONS`](information-schema-partitions-table.md "28.3.21 The INFORMATION_SCHEMA PARTITIONS Table") table:

```sql
mysql> INSERT INTO e VALUES (41, "Michael", "Green");
Query OK, 1 row affected (0.05 sec)

mysql> SELECT PARTITION_NAME, TABLE_ROWS
           FROM INFORMATION_SCHEMA.PARTITIONS
           WHERE TABLE_NAME = 'e';
+----------------+------------+
| PARTITION_NAME | TABLE_ROWS |
+----------------+------------+
| p0             |          1 |
| p1             |          0 |
| p2             |          0 |
| p3             |          3 |
+----------------+------------+
4 rows in set (0.00 sec)
```

Now we once again exchange partition `p0` with
table `e2` using the same
[`ALTER
TABLE`](alter-table-partition-operations.md "15.1.9.1 ALTER TABLE Partition Operations") statement as previously:

```sql
mysql> ALTER TABLE e EXCHANGE PARTITION p0 WITH TABLE e2;
Query OK, 0 rows affected (0.28 sec)
```

The output of the following queries shows that the table row
that was stored in partition `p0` and the table
row that was stored in table `e2`, prior to
issuing the
[`ALTER
TABLE`](alter-table-partition-operations.md "15.1.9.1 ALTER TABLE Partition Operations") statement, have now switched places:

```sql
mysql> SELECT * FROM e;
+------+-------+-------+
| id   | fname | lname |
+------+-------+-------+
|   16 | Frank | White |
| 1669 | Jim   | Smith |
|  337 | Mary  | Jones |
| 2005 | Linda | Black |
+------+-------+-------+
4 rows in set (0.00 sec)

mysql> SELECT PARTITION_NAME, TABLE_ROWS
           FROM INFORMATION_SCHEMA.PARTITIONS
           WHERE TABLE_NAME = 'e';
+----------------+------------+
| PARTITION_NAME | TABLE_ROWS |
+----------------+------------+
| p0             |          1 |
| p1             |          0 |
| p2             |          0 |
| p3             |          3 |
+----------------+------------+
4 rows in set (0.00 sec)

mysql> SELECT * FROM e2;
+----+---------+-------+
| id | fname   | lname |
+----+---------+-------+
| 41 | Michael | Green |
+----+---------+-------+
1 row in set (0.00 sec)
```

#### Nonmatching Rows

You should keep in mind that any rows found in the
nonpartitioned table prior to issuing the
[`ALTER TABLE ...
EXCHANGE PARTITION`](alter-table.md "15.1.9 ALTER TABLE Statement") statement must meet the conditions
required for them to be stored in the target partition;
otherwise, the statement fails. To see how this occurs, first
insert a row into `e2` that is outside the
boundaries of the partition definition for partition
`p0` of table `e`. For
example, insert a row with an `id` column value
that is too large; then, try to exchange the table with the
partition again:

```sql
mysql> INSERT INTO e2 VALUES (51, "Ellen", "McDonald");
Query OK, 1 row affected (0.08 sec)

mysql> ALTER TABLE e EXCHANGE PARTITION p0 WITH TABLE e2;
ERROR 1707 (HY000): Found row that does not match the partition
```

Only the `WITHOUT VALIDATION` option would
permit this operation to succeed:

```sql
mysql> ALTER TABLE e EXCHANGE PARTITION p0 WITH TABLE e2 WITHOUT VALIDATION;
Query OK, 0 rows affected (0.02 sec)
```

When a partition is exchanged with a table that contains rows
that do not match the partition definition, it is the
responsibility of the database administrator to fix the
non-matching rows, which can be performed using
[`REPAIR TABLE`](repair-table.md "15.7.3.5 REPAIR TABLE Statement") or
[`ALTER
TABLE ... REPAIR PARTITION`](alter-table-partition-operations.md "15.1.9.1 ALTER TABLE Partition Operations").

#### Exchanging Partitions Without Row-By-Row Validation

To avoid time consuming validation when exchanging a partition
with a table that has many rows, it is possible to skip the
row-by-row validation step by appending `WITHOUT
VALIDATION` to the
[`ALTER
TABLE ... EXCHANGE PARTITION`](alter-table-partition-operations.md "15.1.9.1 ALTER TABLE Partition Operations") statement.

The following example compares the difference between execution
times when exchanging a partition with a nonpartitioned table,
with and without validation. The partitioned table (table
`e`) contains two partitions of 1 million rows
each. The rows in p0 of table e are removed and p0 is exchanged
with a nonpartitioned table of 1 million rows. The `WITH
VALIDATION` operation takes 0.74 seconds. By
comparison, the `WITHOUT VALIDATION` operation
takes 0.01 seconds.

```sql
# Create a partitioned table with 1 million rows in each partition

CREATE TABLE e (
    id INT NOT NULL,
    fname VARCHAR(30),
    lname VARCHAR(30)
)
    PARTITION BY RANGE (id) (
        PARTITION p0 VALUES LESS THAN (1000001),
        PARTITION p1 VALUES LESS THAN (2000001),
);

mysql> SELECT COUNT(*) FROM e;
| COUNT(*) |
+----------+
|  2000000 |
+----------+
1 row in set (0.27 sec)

# View the rows in each partition

SELECT PARTITION_NAME, TABLE_ROWS FROM INFORMATION_SCHEMA.PARTITIONS WHERE TABLE_NAME = 'e';
+----------------+-------------+
| PARTITION_NAME | TABLE_ROWS  |
+----------------+-------------+
| p0             |     1000000 |
| p1             |     1000000 |
+----------------+-------------+
2 rows in set (0.00 sec)

# Create a nonpartitioned table of the same structure and populate it with 1 million rows

CREATE TABLE e2 (
    id INT NOT NULL,
    fname VARCHAR(30),
    lname VARCHAR(30)
);

mysql> SELECT COUNT(*) FROM e2;
+----------+
| COUNT(*) |
+----------+
|  1000000 |
+----------+
1 row in set (0.24 sec)

# Create another nonpartitioned table of the same structure and populate it with 1 million rows

CREATE TABLE e3 (
    id INT NOT NULL,
    fname VARCHAR(30),
    lname VARCHAR(30)
);

mysql> SELECT COUNT(*) FROM e3;
+----------+
| COUNT(*) |
+----------+
|  1000000 |
+----------+
1 row in set (0.25 sec)

# Drop the rows from p0 of table e

mysql> DELETE FROM e WHERE id < 1000001;
Query OK, 1000000 rows affected (5.55 sec)

# Confirm that there are no rows in partition p0

mysql> SELECT PARTITION_NAME, TABLE_ROWS FROM INFORMATION_SCHEMA.PARTITIONS WHERE TABLE_NAME = 'e';
+----------------+------------+
| PARTITION_NAME | TABLE_ROWS |
+----------------+------------+
| p0             |          0 |
| p1             |    1000000 |
+----------------+------------+
2 rows in set (0.00 sec)

# Exchange partition p0 of table e with the table e2 'WITH VALIDATION'

mysql> ALTER TABLE e EXCHANGE PARTITION p0 WITH TABLE e2 WITH VALIDATION;
Query OK, 0 rows affected (0.74 sec)

# Confirm that the partition was exchanged with table e2

mysql> SELECT PARTITION_NAME, TABLE_ROWS FROM INFORMATION_SCHEMA.PARTITIONS WHERE TABLE_NAME = 'e';
+----------------+------------+
| PARTITION_NAME | TABLE_ROWS |
+----------------+------------+
| p0             |    1000000 |
| p1             |    1000000 |
+----------------+------------+
2 rows in set (0.00 sec)

# Once again, drop the rows from p0 of table e

mysql> DELETE FROM e WHERE id < 1000001;
Query OK, 1000000 rows affected (5.55 sec)

# Confirm that there are no rows in partition p0

mysql> SELECT PARTITION_NAME, TABLE_ROWS FROM INFORMATION_SCHEMA.PARTITIONS WHERE TABLE_NAME = 'e';
+----------------+------------+
| PARTITION_NAME | TABLE_ROWS |
+----------------+------------+
| p0             |          0 |
| p1             |    1000000 |
+----------------+------------+
2 rows in set (0.00 sec)

# Exchange partition p0 of table e with the table e3 'WITHOUT VALIDATION'

mysql> ALTER TABLE e EXCHANGE PARTITION p0 WITH TABLE e3 WITHOUT VALIDATION;
Query OK, 0 rows affected (0.01 sec)

# Confirm that the partition was exchanged with table e3

mysql> SELECT PARTITION_NAME, TABLE_ROWS FROM INFORMATION_SCHEMA.PARTITIONS WHERE TABLE_NAME = 'e';
+----------------+------------+
| PARTITION_NAME | TABLE_ROWS |
+----------------+------------+
| p0             |    1000000 |
| p1             |    1000000 |
+----------------+------------+
2 rows in set (0.00 sec)
```

If a partition is exchanged with a table that contains rows that
do not match the partition definition, it is the responsibility
of the database administrator to fix the non-matching rows,
which can be performed using [`REPAIR
TABLE`](repair-table.md "15.7.3.5 REPAIR TABLE Statement") or
[`ALTER
TABLE ... REPAIR PARTITION`](alter-table-partition-operations.md "15.1.9.1 ALTER TABLE Partition Operations").

#### Exchanging a Subpartition with a Nonpartitioned Table

You can also exchange a subpartition of a subpartitioned table
(see [Section 26.2.6, “Subpartitioning”](partitioning-subpartitions.md "26.2.6 Subpartitioning")) with a
nonpartitioned table using an
[`ALTER TABLE ...
EXCHANGE PARTITION`](alter-table.md "15.1.9 ALTER TABLE Statement") statement. In the following
example, we first create a table `es` that is
partitioned by `RANGE` and subpartitioned by
`KEY`, populate this table as we did table
`e`, and then create an empty, nonpartitioned
copy `es2` of the table, as shown here:

```sql
mysql> CREATE TABLE es (
    ->     id INT NOT NULL,
    ->     fname VARCHAR(30),
    ->     lname VARCHAR(30)
    -> )
    ->     PARTITION BY RANGE (id)
    ->     SUBPARTITION BY KEY (lname)
    ->     SUBPARTITIONS 2 (
    ->         PARTITION p0 VALUES LESS THAN (50),
    ->         PARTITION p1 VALUES LESS THAN (100),
    ->         PARTITION p2 VALUES LESS THAN (150),
    ->         PARTITION p3 VALUES LESS THAN (MAXVALUE)
    ->     );
Query OK, 0 rows affected (2.76 sec)

mysql> INSERT INTO es VALUES
    ->     (1669, "Jim", "Smith"),
    ->     (337, "Mary", "Jones"),
    ->     (16, "Frank", "White"),
    ->     (2005, "Linda", "Black");
Query OK, 4 rows affected (0.04 sec)
Records: 4  Duplicates: 0  Warnings: 0

mysql> CREATE TABLE es2 LIKE es;
Query OK, 0 rows affected (1.27 sec)

mysql> ALTER TABLE es2 REMOVE PARTITIONING;
Query OK, 0 rows affected (0.70 sec)
Records: 0  Duplicates: 0  Warnings: 0
```

Although we did not explicitly name any of the subpartitions
when creating table `es`, we can obtain
generated names for these by including the
`SUBPARTITION_NAME` column of the
[`PARTITIONS`](information-schema-partitions-table.md "28.3.21 The INFORMATION_SCHEMA PARTITIONS Table") table from
`INFORMATION_SCHEMA` when selecting from that
table, as shown here:

```sql
mysql> SELECT PARTITION_NAME, SUBPARTITION_NAME, TABLE_ROWS
    ->     FROM INFORMATION_SCHEMA.PARTITIONS
    ->     WHERE TABLE_NAME = 'es';
+----------------+-------------------+------------+
| PARTITION_NAME | SUBPARTITION_NAME | TABLE_ROWS |
+----------------+-------------------+------------+
| p0             | p0sp0             |          1 |
| p0             | p0sp1             |          0 |
| p1             | p1sp0             |          0 |
| p1             | p1sp1             |          0 |
| p2             | p2sp0             |          0 |
| p2             | p2sp1             |          0 |
| p3             | p3sp0             |          3 |
| p3             | p3sp1             |          0 |
+----------------+-------------------+------------+
8 rows in set (0.00 sec)
```

The following
[`ALTER
TABLE`](alter-table-partition-operations.md "15.1.9.1 ALTER TABLE Partition Operations") statement exchanges subpartition
`p3sp0` in table `es` with the
nonpartitioned table `es2`:

```sql
mysql> ALTER TABLE es EXCHANGE PARTITION p3sp0 WITH TABLE es2;
Query OK, 0 rows affected (0.29 sec)
```

You can verify that the rows were exchanged by issuing the
following queries:

```sql
mysql> SELECT PARTITION_NAME, SUBPARTITION_NAME, TABLE_ROWS
    ->     FROM INFORMATION_SCHEMA.PARTITIONS
    ->     WHERE TABLE_NAME = 'es';
+----------------+-------------------+------------+
| PARTITION_NAME | SUBPARTITION_NAME | TABLE_ROWS |
+----------------+-------------------+------------+
| p0             | p0sp0             |          1 |
| p0             | p0sp1             |          0 |
| p1             | p1sp0             |          0 |
| p1             | p1sp1             |          0 |
| p2             | p2sp0             |          0 |
| p2             | p2sp1             |          0 |
| p3             | p3sp0             |          0 |
| p3             | p3sp1             |          0 |
+----------------+-------------------+------------+
8 rows in set (0.00 sec)

mysql> SELECT * FROM es2;
+------+-------+-------+
| id   | fname | lname |
+------+-------+-------+
| 1669 | Jim   | Smith |
|  337 | Mary  | Jones |
| 2005 | Linda | Black |
+------+-------+-------+
3 rows in set (0.00 sec)
```

If a table is subpartitioned, you can exchange only a
subpartition of the table—not an entire
partition—with an unpartitioned table, as shown here:

```sql
mysql> ALTER TABLE es EXCHANGE PARTITION p3 WITH TABLE es2;
ERROR 1704 (HY000): Subpartitioned table, use subpartition instead of partition
```

Table structures are compared in a strict fashion; the number,
order, names, and types of columns and indexes of the
partitioned table and the nonpartitioned table must match
exactly. In addition, both tables must use the same storage
engine:

```sql
mysql> CREATE TABLE es3 LIKE e;
Query OK, 0 rows affected (1.31 sec)

mysql> ALTER TABLE es3 REMOVE PARTITIONING;
Query OK, 0 rows affected (0.53 sec)
Records: 0  Duplicates: 0  Warnings: 0

mysql> SHOW CREATE TABLE es3\G
*************************** 1. row ***************************
       Table: es3
Create Table: CREATE TABLE `es3` (
  `id` int(11) NOT NULL,
  `fname` varchar(30) DEFAULT NULL,
  `lname` varchar(30) DEFAULT NULL
) ENGINE=InnoDB DEFAULT CHARSET=utf8mb4 COLLATE=utf8mb4_0900_ai_ci
1 row in set (0.00 sec)

mysql> ALTER TABLE es3 ENGINE = MyISAM;
Query OK, 0 rows affected (0.15 sec)
