## 6.10 Unix Signal Handling in MySQL

On Unix and Unix-like systems, a process can be the recipient of
signals sent to it by the `root` system account
or the system account that owns the process. Signals can be sent
using the [**kill**](kill.md "15.7.8.4 KILL Statement") command. Some command
interpreters associate certain key sequences with signals, such as
**Control+C** to send a `SIGINT`
signal. This section describes how the MySQL server and client
programs respond to signals.

- [Server Response to Signals](unix-signal-response.md#server-signal-response "Server Response to Signals")
- [Client Response to Signals](unix-signal-response.md#client-signal-response "Client Response to Signals")

### Server Response to Signals

[**mysqld**](mysqld.md "6.3.1 mysqld — The MySQL Server") responds to signals as follows:

- `SIGTERM` causes the server to shut down.
  This is like executing a
  [`SHUTDOWN`](shutdown.md "15.7.8.9 SHUTDOWN Statement") statement without
  having to connect to the server (which for shutdown requires
  an account that has the
  [`SHUTDOWN`](privileges-provided.md#priv_shutdown) privilege).
- `SIGHUP` causes the server to reload the
  grant tables and to flush tables, logs, the thread cache,
  and the host cache. These actions are like various forms of
  the [`FLUSH`](flush.md "15.7.8.3 FLUSH Statement") statement. Sending
  the signal enables the flush operations to be performed
  without having to connect to the server, which requires a
  MySQL account that has privileges sufficient for those
  operations. Prior to MySQL 8.0.20, the server also writes a
  status report to the error log that has this format:

- As of MySQL 8.0.19, `SIGUSR1` causes the
  server to flush the error log, general query log, and slow
  query log. One use for `SIGUSR1` is to
  implement log rotation without having to connect to the
  server, which requires a MySQL account that has privileges
  sufficient for those operations. For information about log
  rotation, see [Section 7.4.6, “Server Log Maintenance”](log-file-maintenance.md "7.4.6 Server Log Maintenance").

  The server response to `SIGUSR1` is a
  subset of the response to `SIGHUP`,
  enabling `SIGUSR1` to be used as a more
  “lightweight” signal that flushes certain logs
  without the other `SIGHUP` effects such as
  flushing the thread and host caches and writing a status
  report to the error log.
- `SIGINT` normally is ignored by the server.
  Starting the server with the
  [`--gdb`](server-options.md#option_mysqld_gdb) option installs an
  interrupt handler for `SIGINT` for
  debugging purposes. See
  [Section 7.9.1.4, “Debugging mysqld under gdb”](using-gdb-on-mysqld.md "7.9.1.4 Debugging mysqld under gdb").

### Client Response to Signals

MySQL client programs respond to signals as follows:

- The [**mysql**](mysql.md "6.5.1 mysql — The MySQL Command-Line Client") client interprets
  `SIGINT` (typically the result of typing
  **Control+C**) as instruction to interrupt the
  current statement if there is one, or to cancel any partial
  input line otherwise. This behavior can be disabled using
  the [`--sigint-ignore`](mysql-command-options.md#option_mysql_sigint-ignore) option to
  ignore `SIGINT` signals.
- Client programs that use the MySQL client library block
  `SIGPIPE` signals by default. These
  variations are possible:

  - Client can install their own `SIGPIPE`
    handler to override the default behavior. See
    [Writing C API Threaded Client Programs](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/c-api/8.0/en/c-api-threaded-clients.html).
  - Clients can prevent installation of
    `SIGPIPE` handlers by specifying the
    `CLIENT_IGNORE_SIGPIPE` option to
    [`mysql_real_connect()`](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/c-api/8.0/en/mysql-real-connect.html) at
    connect time. See [mysql\_real\_connect()](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/c-api/8.0/en/mysql-real-connect.html).
