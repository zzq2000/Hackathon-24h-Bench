#### 20.2.1.6 Adding Instances to the Group

At this point, the group has one member in it, server s1, which
has some data in it. It is now time to expand the group by
adding the other two servers configured previously.

##### 20.2.1.6.1 Adding a Second Instance

In order to add a second instance, server s2, first create the
configuration file for it. The configuration is similar to the
one used for server s1, except for things such as the
[`server_id`](replication-options.md#sysvar_server_id).

```ini
[mysqld]

#
# Disable other storage engines
#
disabled_storage_engines="MyISAM,BLACKHOLE,FEDERATED,ARCHIVE,MEMORY"

#
# Replication configuration parameters
#
server_id=2
gtid_mode=ON
enforce_gtid_consistency=ON
binlog_checksum=NONE           # Not needed in 8.0.21 or later

#
# Group Replication configuration
#
plugin_load_add='group_replication.so'
group_replication_group_name="aaaaaaaa-aaaa-aaaa-aaaa-aaaaaaaaaaaa"
group_replication_start_on_boot=off
group_replication_local_address= "s2:33061"
group_replication_group_seeds= "s1:33061,s2:33061,s3:33061"
group_replication_bootstrap_group= off
```

Similar to the procedure for server s1, with the option file
in place you launch the server. Then configure the distributed
recovery credentials as follows. The statements are the same
as used when setting up server s1 as the user is shared within
the group. This member needs to have the same replication user
configured in
[Section 20.2.1.3, “User Credentials For Distributed Recovery”](group-replication-user-credentials.md "20.2.1.3 User Credentials For Distributed Recovery"). If you
are relying on distributed recovery to configure the user on
all members, when s2 connects to the seed s1 the replication
user is replicated or cloned to s1. If you did not have binary
logging enabled when you configured the user credentials on
s1, and a remote cloning operation is not used for state
transfer, you must create the replication user on s2. In this
case, connect to s2 and issue:

```sql
SET SQL_LOG_BIN=0;
CREATE USER rpl_user@'%' IDENTIFIED BY 'password';
GRANT REPLICATION SLAVE ON *.* TO rpl_user@'%';
GRANT CONNECTION_ADMIN ON *.* TO rpl_user@'%';
GRANT BACKUP_ADMIN ON *.* TO rpl_user@'%';
GRANT GROUP_REPLICATION_STREAM ON *.* TO rpl_user@'%';
FLUSH PRIVILEGES;
SET SQL_LOG_BIN=1;
```

If you are providing user credentials using a
[`CHANGE REPLICATION SOURCE TO`](change-replication-source-to.md "15.4.2.3 CHANGE REPLICATION SOURCE TO Statement") |
[`CHANGE MASTER TO`](change-master-to.md "15.4.2.1 CHANGE MASTER TO Statement") statement,
issue the following statement after that:

```sql
CHANGE MASTER TO MASTER_USER='rpl_user', MASTER_PASSWORD='password' \\
	FOR CHANNEL 'group_replication_recovery';
```

In MySQL 8.0.23 and lter, use this instead:

```sql
CHANGE REPLICATION SOURCE TO SOURCE_USER='rpl_user', SOURCE_PASSWORD='password' \\
	FOR CHANNEL 'group_replication_recovery';
```

Tip

If you are using the caching SHA-2 authentication plugin,
the default in MySQL 8, see
[Section 20.6.3.1.1, “Replication User With The Caching SHA-2 Authentication Plugin”](group-replication-secure-user.md#group-replication-caching-sha2-user-credentials "20.6.3.1.1 Replication User With The Caching SHA-2 Authentication Plugin").

If necessary, install the Group Replication plugin, see
[Section 20.2.1.4, “Launching Group Replication”](group-replication-launching.md "20.2.1.4 Launching Group Replication").

Start Group Replication and s2 starts the process of joining
the group.

```sql
mysql> START GROUP_REPLICATION;
```

If you are providing user credentials for distributed recovery
as part of [`START
GROUP_REPLICATION`](start-group-replication.md "15.4.3.1 START GROUP_REPLICATION Statement") (MySQL 8.0.21 or later), you can
do so like this:

```sql
mysql> START GROUP_REPLICATION USER='rpl_user', PASSWORD='password';
```

Unlike the previous steps that were the same as those executed
on s1, here there is a difference in that you do
*not* need to bootstrap the group because
the group already exists. In other words on s2
[`group_replication_bootstrap_group`](group-replication-system-variables.md#sysvar_group_replication_bootstrap_group)
is set to `OFF`, and you do not issue
`SET GLOBAL
group_replication_bootstrap_group=ON;` before
starting Group Replication, because the group has already been
created and bootstrapped by server s1. At this point server s2
only needs to be added to the already existing group.

Tip

When Group Replication starts successfully and the server
joins the group it checks the
[`super_read_only`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_super_read_only) variable.
By setting [`super_read_only`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_super_read_only)
to ON in the member's configuration file, you can
ensure that servers which fail when starting Group
Replication for any reason do not accept transactions. If
the server should join the group as a read/write instance,
for example as the primary in a single-primary group or as a
member of a multi-primary group, when
[`super_read_only`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_super_read_only) is set to
`ON` then it is set to
`OFF` upon joining the group.

Checking the
[`performance_schema.replication_group_members`](performance-schema-replication-group-members-table.md "29.12.11.16 The replication_group_members Table")
table again shows that there are now two
`ONLINE` servers in the group.

```sql
mysql> SELECT * FROM performance_schema.replication_group_members;
+---------------------------+--------------------------------------+-------------+-------------+--------------+-------------+----------------+----------------------------+
| CHANNEL_NAME              | MEMBER_ID                            | MEMBER_HOST | MEMBER_PORT | MEMBER_STATE | MEMBER_ROLE | MEMBER_VERSION | MEMBER_COMMUNICATION_STACK |

| group_replication_applier | ac39f1e6-6dfa-11e6-a69d-00212844f856 |   s2        |        3306 | ONLINE       | SECONDARY   | 8.0.45          | XCom                       |
+---------------------------+--------------------------------------+-------------+-------------+--------------+-------------+----------------+----------------------------+
```

When s2 attempted to join the group,
[Section 20.5.4, “Distributed Recovery”](group-replication-distributed-recovery.md "20.5.4 Distributed Recovery")
ensured that s2 applied the same transactions which s1 had
applied. Once this process completed, s2 could join the group
as a member, and at this point it is marked as
`ONLINE`. In other words it must have already
caught up with server s1 automatically. Once s2 is
`ONLINE`, it then begins to process
transactions with the group. Verify that s2 has indeed
synchronized with server s1 as follows.

```

As seen above, the second server has been added to the group
and it has replicated the changes from server s1
automatically. In other words, the transactions applied on s1
up to the point in time that s2 joined the group have been
replicated to s2.

##### 20.2.1.6.2 Adding Additional Instances

Adding additional instances to the group is essentially the
same sequence of steps as adding the second server, except
that the configuration has to be changed as it had to be for
server s2. To summarise the required operations:

1. Create the configuration file.

   ```ini
   [mysqld]

   #
   # Disable other storage engines
   #
   disabled_storage_engines="MyISAM,BLACKHOLE,FEDERATED,ARCHIVE,MEMORY"

   #
   # Replication configuration parameters
   #
   server_id=3
   gtid_mode=ON
   enforce_gtid_consistency=ON
   binlog_checksum=NONE           # Not needed from 8.0.21

   #
   # Group Replication configuration
   #
   plugin_load_add='group_replication.so'
   group_replication_group_name="aaaaaaaa-aaaa-aaaa-aaaa-aaaaaaaaaaaa"
   group_replication_start_on_boot=off
   group_replication_local_address= "s3:33061"
   group_replication_group_seeds= "s1:33061,s2:33061,s3:33061"
   group_replication_bootstrap_group= off
   ```
2. Start the server and connect to it. Create the replication
   user for distributed recovery.

   ```sql
   SET SQL_LOG_BIN=0;
   CREATE USER rpl_user@'%' IDENTIFIED BY 'password';
   GRANT REPLICATION SLAVE ON *.* TO rpl_user@'%';
   GRANT CONNECTION_ADMIN ON *.* TO rpl_user@'%';
   GRANT BACKUP_ADMIN ON *.* TO rpl_user@'%';
   GRANT GROUP_REPLICATION_STREAM ON *.* TO rpl_user@'%';
   FLUSH PRIVILEGES;
   SET SQL_LOG_BIN=1;
   ```

   If you are providing user credentials using a
   [`CHANGE REPLICATION SOURCE
   TO`](change-replication-source-to.md "15.4.2.3 CHANGE REPLICATION SOURCE TO Statement") | [`CHANGE MASTER
   TO`](change-master-to.md "15.4.2.1 CHANGE MASTER TO Statement") statement, issue the following statement
   after that:

   ```sql
   CHANGE MASTER TO MASTER_USER='rpl_user', MASTER_PASSWORD='password' \\
   	FOR CHANNEL 'group_replication_recovery';
   ```

   In MySQL 8.0.23 or later, use this statement instead:

   ```sql
   CHANGE REPLICATION SOURCE TO SOURCE_USER='rpl_user', SOURCE_PASSWORD='password' \\
   	FOR CHANNEL 'group_replication_recovery';
   ```
3. Install the Group Replication plugin if necessary, like
   this:

   ```sql
   mysql> INSTALL PLUGIN group_replication SONAME 'group_replication.so';
   ```
4. Start Group Replication:

   ```sql
   mysql> START GROUP_REPLICATION;
   ```

   If you are providing user credentials for distributed
   recovery in the [`START
   GROUP_REPLICATION`](start-group-replication.md "15.4.3.1 START GROUP_REPLICATION Statement") statement (MySQL 8.0.21 or
   later), you can do so like this:

   ```sql
   mysql> START GROUP_REPLICATION USER='rpl_user', PASSWORD='password';
   ```

At this point server s3 is booted and running, has joined the
group and caught up with the other servers in the group.
Consulting the
[`performance_schema.replication_group_members`](performance-schema-replication-group-members-table.md "29.12.11.16 The replication_group_members Table")
table again confirms this is the case.

```sql
mysql> SELECT * FROM performance_schema.replication_group_members;
+---------------------------+--------------------------------------+-------------+-------------+--------------+-------------+----------------+----------------------------+
| CHANNEL_NAME              | MEMBER_ID                            | MEMBER_HOST | MEMBER_PORT | MEMBER_STATE | MEMBER_ROLE | MEMBER_VERSION | MEMBER_COMMUNICATION_STACK |
+---------------------------+--------------------------------------+-------------+-------------+--------------+-------------+----------------+----------------------------+
| group_replication_applier | 395409e1-6dfa-11e6-970b-00212844f856 |   s1        |        3306 | ONLINE       | PRIMARY     | 8.0.45          | XCom                       |
| group_replication_applier | 7eb217ff-6df3-11e6-966c-00212844f856 |   s3        |        3306 | ONLINE       | SECONDARY   | 8.0.45          | XCom                       |
| group_replication_applier | ac39f1e6-6dfa-11e6-a69d-00212844f856 |   s2        |        3306 | ONLINE       | SECONDARY   | 8.0.45          | XCom                       |
+---------------------------+--------------------------------------+-------------+-------------+--------------+-------------+----------------+----------------------------+
```

Issuing this same query on server s2 or server s1 yields the
same result. Also, you can verify that server s3 has caught
up:

```sql
