#### 30.4.3.49 The wait\_classes\_global\_by\_latency and x$wait\_classes\_global\_by\_latency Views

These views summarize wait class total latencies, grouped by
event class. By default, rows are sorted by descending total
latency. Idle events are ignored.

An event class is determined by stripping from the event name
everything after the first three components. For example, the
class for `wait/io/file/sql/slow_log` is
`wait/io/file`.

The
[`wait_classes_global_by_latency`](sys-wait-classes-global-by-latency.md "30.4.3.49 The wait_classes_global_by_latency and x$wait_classes_global_by_latency Views")
and
[`x$wait_classes_global_by_latency`](sys-wait-classes-global-by-latency.md "30.4.3.49 The wait_classes_global_by_latency and x$wait_classes_global_by_latency Views")
views have these columns:

- `event_class`

  The event class.
- `total`

  The total number of occurrences of events in the class.
- `total_latency`

  The total wait time of timed occurrences of events in the
  class.
- `min_latency`

  The minimum single wait time of timed occurrences of
  events in the class.
- `avg_latency`

  The average wait time per timed occurrence of events in
  the class.
- `max_latency`

  The maximum single wait time of timed occurrences of
  events in the class.
