#### 8.4.4.2 Keyring Component Installation

Keyring service consumers require that a keyring component or
plugin be installed:

- To use a keyring component, begin with the instructions
  here.
- To use a keyring plugin instead, begin with
  [Section 8.4.4.3, “Keyring Plugin Installation”](keyring-plugin-installation.md "8.4.4.3 Keyring Plugin Installation").
- If you intend to use keyring functions in conjunction with
  the chosen keyring component or plugin, install the
  functions after installing that component or plugin, using
  the instructions in
  [Section 8.4.4.15, “General-Purpose Keyring Key-Management Functions”](keyring-functions-general-purpose.md "8.4.4.15 General-Purpose Keyring Key-Management Functions").

Note

Only one keyring component or plugin should be enabled at a
time. Enabling multiple keyring components or plugins is
unsupported and results may not be as anticipated.

MySQL provides these keyring component choices:

- `component_keyring_file`: Stores keyring
  data in a file local to the server host. Available in MySQL Community Edition
  and MySQL Enterprise Edition distributions.
- `component_keyring_encrypted_file`: Stores
  keyring data in an encrypted, password-protected file local
  to the server host. Available in MySQL Enterprise Edition distributions.
- `component_keyring_oci`: Stores keyring
  data in the Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Vault. Available in MySQL Enterprise Edition distributions.

To be usable by the server, the component library file must be
located in the MySQL plugin directory (the directory named by
the [`plugin_dir`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_plugin_dir) system
variable). If necessary, configure the plugin directory location
by setting the value of
[`plugin_dir`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_plugin_dir) at server startup.

A keyring component or plugin must be loaded early during the
server startup sequence so that other components can access it
as necessary during their own initialization. For example, the
`InnoDB` storage engine uses the keyring for
tablespace encryption, so a keyring component or plugin must be
loaded and available prior to `InnoDB`
initialization.

Note

A keyring component must be enabled on the MySQL server
instance if you need to support secure storage for persisted
system variable values. The keyring plugin does not support
the function. See
[Persisting Sensitive System Variables](persisted-system-variables.md#persisted-system-variables-sensitive "Persisting Sensitive System Variables").

Unlike keyring plugins, keyring components are not loaded using
the [`--early-plugin-load`](server-options.md#option_mysqld_early-plugin-load) server
option or configured using system variables. Instead, the server
determines which keyring component to load during startup using
a manifest, and the loaded component consults its own
configuration file when it initializes. Therefore, to install a
keyring component, you must:

1. Write a manifest that tells the server which keyring
   component to load.
2. Write a configuration file for that keyring component.

The first step in installing a keyring component is writing a
manifest that indicates which component to load. During startup,
the server reads either a global manifest file, or a global
manifest file paired with a local manifest file:

- The server attempts to read its global manifest file from
  the directory where the server is installed.
- If the global manifest file indicates use of a local
  manifest file, the server attempts to read its local
  manifest file from the data directory.
- Although global and local manifest files are located in
  different directories, the file name is
  `mysqld.my` in both locations.
- It is not an error for a manifest file not to exist. In this
  case, the server attempts no component loading associated
  with the file.

Local manifest files permit setting up component loading for
multiple instances of the server, such that loading instructions
for each server instance are specific to a given data directory
instance. This enables different MySQL instances to use
different keyring components.

Server manifest files have these properties:

- A manifest file must be in valid JSON format.
- A manifest file permits these items:

  - `"read_local_manifest"`: This item is
    permitted only in the global manifest file. If the item
    is not present, the server uses only the global manifest
    file. If the item is present, its value is
    `true` or `false`,
    indicating whether the server should read
    component-loading information from the local manifest
    file.

    If the `"read_local_manifest"` item is
    present in the global manifest file along with other
    items, the server checks the
    `"read_local_manifest"` item value
    first:

    - If the value is `false`, the server
      processes the other items in the global manifest
      file and ignores the local manifest file.
    - If the value is `true`, the server
      ignores the other items in the global manifest file
      and attempts to read the local manifest file.
  - `"components"`: This item indicates
    which component to load. The item value is a string that
    specifies a valid component URN, such as
    `"file://component_keyring_file"`. A
    component URN begins with `file://` and
    indicates the base name of the library file located in
    the MySQL plugin directory that implements the
    component.
- Server access to a manifest file should be read only. For
  example, a `mysqld.my` server manifest
  file may be owned by `root` and be
  read/write to `root`, but should be read
  only to the account used to run the MySQL server. If the
  manifest file is found during startup to be read/write to
  that account, the server writes a warning to the error log
  suggesting that the file be made read only.
- The database administrator has the responsibility for
  creating any manifest files to be used, and for ensuring
  that their access mode and contents are correct. If an error
  occurs, server startup fails and the administrator must
  correct any issues indicated by diagnostics in the server
  error log.

Given the preceding manifest file properties, to configure the
server to load `component_keyring_file`, create
a global manifest file named `mysqld.my` in
the [**mysqld**](mysqld.md "6.3.1 mysqld — The MySQL Server") installation directory, and
optionally create a local manifest file, also named
`mysqld.my`, in the data directory. The
following instructions describe how to load
`component_keyring_file`. To load a different
keyring component, substitute its name for
`component_keyring_file`.

- To use a global manifest file only, the file contents look
  like this:

  ```json
  {
    "components": "file://component_keyring_file"
  }
  ```

  Create this file in the directory where
  [**mysqld**](mysqld.md "6.3.1 mysqld — The MySQL Server") is installed.
- Alternatively, to use a global and local manifest file pair,
  the global file looks like this:

  ```json
  {
    "read_local_manifest": true
  }
  ```

  Create this file in the directory where
  [**mysqld**](mysqld.md "6.3.1 mysqld — The MySQL Server") is installed.

  The local file looks like this:

  ```json
  {
    "components": "file://component_keyring_file"
  }
  ```

  Create this file in the data directory.

With the manifest in place, proceed to configuring the keyring
component. To do this, check the notes for your chosen keyring
component for configuration instructions specific to that
component:

- `component_keyring_file`:
  [Section 8.4.4.4, “Using the component\_keyring\_file File-Based Keyring Component”](keyring-file-component.md "8.4.4.4 Using the component_keyring_file File-Based Keyring Component").
- `component_keyring_encrypted_file`:
  [Section 8.4.4.5, “Using the component\_keyring\_encrypted\_file Encrypted File-Based Keyring
  Component”](keyring-encrypted-file-component.md "8.4.4.5 Using the component_keyring_encrypted_file Encrypted File-Based Keyring Component").
- `component_keyring_oci`:
  [Section 8.4.4.11, “Using the Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Vault Keyring Component”](keyring-oci-component.md "8.4.4.11 Using the Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Vault Keyring Component").

After performing any component-specific configuration, start the
server. Verify component installation by examining the
Performance Schema
[`keyring_component_status`](performance-schema-keyring-component-status-table.md "29.12.18.1 The keyring_component_status Table") table:

```sql
mysql> SELECT * FROM performance_schema.keyring_component_status;

+---------------------+-------------------------------------------------+
```

A `Component_status` value of
`Active` indicates that the component
initialized successfully.

If the component cannot be loaded, server startup fails. Check
the server error log for diagnostic messages. If the component
loads but fails to initialize due to configuration problems, the
server starts but the `Component_status` value
is `Disabled`. Check the server error log,
correct the configuration issues, and use the
[`ALTER INSTANCE RELOAD KEYRING`](alter-instance.md#alter-instance-reload-keyring)
statement to reload the configuration.

Keyring components should be loaded only by using a manifest
file, not by using the [`INSTALL
COMPONENT`](install-component.md "15.7.4.3 INSTALL COMPONENT Statement") statement. Keyring components loaded using
that statement may be available too late in the server startup
sequence for certain components that use the keyring, such as
`InnoDB`, because they are registered in the
`mysql.component` system table and loaded
automatically for subsequent server restarts. But
`mysql.component` is an
`InnoDB` table, so any components named in it
can be loaded during startup only after
`InnoDB` initialization.

If no keyring component or plugin is available when a component
tries to access the keyring service, the service cannot be used
by that component. As a result, the component may fail to
initialize or may initialize with limited functionality. For
example, if `InnoDB` finds that there are
encrypted tablespaces when it initializes, it attempts to access
the keyring. If the keyring is unavailable,
`InnoDB` can access only unencrypted
tablespaces.
