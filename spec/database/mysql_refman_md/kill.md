#### 15.7.8.4 KILL Statement

```sql
KILL [CONNECTION | QUERY] processlist_id
```

Each connection to [**mysqld**](mysqld.md "6.3.1 mysqld — The MySQL Server") runs in a separate
thread. You can kill a thread with the `KILL
processlist_id` statement.

Thread processlist identifiers can be determined from the
`ID` column of the
`INFORMATION_SCHEMA`
[`PROCESSLIST`](information-schema-processlist-table.md "28.3.23 The INFORMATION_SCHEMA PROCESSLIST Table") table, the
`Id` column of [`SHOW
PROCESSLIST`](show-processlist.md "15.7.7.29 SHOW PROCESSLIST Statement") output, and the
`PROCESSLIST_ID` column of the Performance
Schema [`threads`](performance-schema-threads-table.md "29.12.21.8 The threads Table") table. The value for
the current thread is returned by the
[`CONNECTION_ID()`](information-functions.md#function_connection-id) function.

[`KILL`](kill.md "15.7.8.4 KILL Statement") permits an optional
`CONNECTION` or `QUERY`
modifier:

- [`KILL
  CONNECTION`](kill.md "15.7.8.4 KILL Statement") is the same as
  [`KILL`](kill.md "15.7.8.4 KILL Statement") with no modifier: It
  terminates the connection associated with the given
  *`processlist_id`*, after terminating
  any statement the connection is executing.
- [`KILL QUERY`](kill.md "15.7.8.4 KILL Statement")
  terminates the statement the connection is currently
  executing, but leaves the connection itself intact.

The ability to see which threads are available to be killed
depends on the [`PROCESS`](privileges-provided.md#priv_process) privilege:

- Without [`PROCESS`](privileges-provided.md#priv_process), you can see
  only your own threads.
- With [`PROCESS`](privileges-provided.md#priv_process), you can see all
  threads.

The ability to kill threads and statements depends on the
[`CONNECTION_ADMIN`](privileges-provided.md#priv_connection-admin) privilege and
the deprecated [`SUPER`](privileges-provided.md#priv_super) privilege:

- Without [`CONNECTION_ADMIN`](privileges-provided.md#priv_connection-admin) or
  [`SUPER`](privileges-provided.md#priv_super), you can kill only your
  own threads and statements.
- With [`CONNECTION_ADMIN`](privileges-provided.md#priv_connection-admin) or
  [`SUPER`](privileges-provided.md#priv_super), you can kill all
  threads and statements, except that to affect a thread or
  statement that is executing with the
  [`SYSTEM_USER`](privileges-provided.md#priv_system-user) privilege, your
  own session must additionally have the
  [`SYSTEM_USER`](privileges-provided.md#priv_system-user) privilege.

You can also use the [**mysqladmin processlist**](mysqladmin.md "6.5.2 mysqladmin — A MySQL Server Administration Program")
and [**mysqladmin kill**](mysqladmin.md "6.5.2 mysqladmin — A MySQL Server Administration Program") commands to examine and
kill threads.

When you use [`KILL`](kill.md "15.7.8.4 KILL Statement"), a
thread-specific kill flag is set for the thread. In most cases,
it might take some time for the thread to die because the kill
flag is checked only at specific intervals:

- During [`SELECT`](select.md "15.2.13 SELECT Statement") operations, for
  `ORDER BY` and `GROUP BY`
  loops, the flag is checked after reading a block of rows. If
  the kill flag is set, the statement is aborted.
- [`ALTER TABLE`](alter-table.md "15.1.9 ALTER TABLE Statement") operations that
  make a table copy check the kill flag periodically for each
  few copied rows read from the original table. If the kill
  flag was set, the statement is aborted and the temporary
  table is deleted.

  The [`KILL`](kill.md "15.7.8.4 KILL Statement") statement returns
  without waiting for confirmation, but the kill flag check
  aborts the operation within a reasonably small amount of
  time. Aborting the operation to perform any necessary
  cleanup also takes some time.
- During [`UPDATE`](update.md "15.2.17 UPDATE Statement") or
  [`DELETE`](delete.md "15.2.2 DELETE Statement") operations, the kill
  flag is checked after each block read and after each updated
  or deleted row. If the kill flag is set, the statement is
  aborted. If you are not using transactions, the changes are
  not rolled back.
- [`GET_LOCK()`](locking-functions.md#function_get-lock) aborts and returns
  `NULL`.
- If the thread is in the table lock handler (state:
  `Locked`), the table lock is quickly
  aborted.
- If the thread is waiting for free disk space in a write
  call, the write is aborted with a “disk full”
  error message.
- [`EXPLAIN ANALYZE`](explain.md#explain-analyze "Obtaining Information with EXPLAIN ANALYZE") aborts and
  prints the first row of output. This works in MySQL 8.0.20
  and later.

Warning

Killing a [`REPAIR TABLE`](repair-table.md "15.7.3.5 REPAIR TABLE Statement") or
[`OPTIMIZE TABLE`](optimize-table.md "15.7.3.4 OPTIMIZE TABLE Statement") operation on a
`MyISAM` table results in a table that is
corrupted and unusable. Any reads or writes to such a table
fail until you optimize or repair it again (without
interruption).
