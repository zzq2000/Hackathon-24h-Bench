### 8.2.18 Multifactor Authentication

Authentication involves one party establishing its identity to the
satisfaction of a second party. Multifactor authentication (MFA)
is the use of multiple authentication values (or
“factors”) during the authentication process. MFA
provides greater security than one-factor/single-factor
authentication (1FA/SFA), which uses only one authentication
method such as a password. MFA enables additional authentication
methods, such as authentication using multiple passwords, or
authentication using devices like smart cards, security keys, and
biometric readers.

MySQL 8.0.27 and higher includes support for multifactor
authentication. This capability includes forms of MFA that require
up to three authentication values. That is, MySQL account
management supports accounts that use 2FA or 3FA, in addition to
the existing 1FA support.

When a client attempts a connection to the MySQL server using a
single-factor account, the server invokes the authentication
plugin indicated by the account definition and accepts or rejects
the connection depending on whether the plugin reports success or
failure.

For an account that has multiple authentication factors, the
process is similar. The server invokes authentication plugins in
the order listed in the account definition. If a plugin reports
success, the server either accepts the connection if the plugin is
the last one, or proceeds to invoke the next plugin if any remain.
If any plugin reports failure, the server rejects the connection.

The following sections cover multifactor authentication in MySQL
in more detail.

- [Elements of Multifactor Authentication Support](multifactor-authentication.md#multifactor-authentication-elements "Elements of Multifactor Authentication Support")
- [Configuring the Multifactor Authentication Policy](multifactor-authentication.md#multifactor-authentication-policy "Configuring the Multifactor Authentication Policy")
- [Getting Started with Multifactor Authentication](multifactor-authentication.md#multifactor-authentication-getting-started "Getting Started with Multifactor Authentication")

#### Elements of Multifactor Authentication Support

Authentication factors commonly include these types of
information:

- Something you know, such as a secret password or passphrase.
- Something you have, such as a security key or smart card.
- Something you are; that is, a biometric characteristic such
  as a fingerprint or facial scan.

The “something you know” factor type relies on
information that is kept secret on both sides of the
authentication process. Unfortunately, secrets may be subject to
compromise: Someone might see you enter your password or fool
you with a phishing attack, a password stored on the server side
might be exposed by a security breach, and so forth. Security
can be improved by using multiple passwords, but each may still
be subject to compromise. Use of the other factor types enables
improved security with less risk of compromise.

Implementation of multifactor authentication in MySQL comprises
these elements:

- The [`authentication_policy`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_authentication_policy)
  system variable controls how many authentication factors can
  be used and the types of authentication permitted for each
  factor. That is, it places constraints on
  [`CREATE USER`](create-user.md "15.7.1.3 CREATE USER Statement") and
  [`ALTER USER`](alter-user.md "15.7.1.1 ALTER USER Statement") statements with
  respect to multifactor authentication.
- [`CREATE USER`](create-user.md "15.7.1.3 CREATE USER Statement") and
  [`ALTER USER`](alter-user.md "15.7.1.1 ALTER USER Statement") have syntax
  enabling multiple authentication methods to be specified for
  new accounts, and for adding, modifying, or dropping
  authentication methods for existing accounts. If an account
  uses 2FA or 3FA, the `mysql.user` system
  table stores information about the additional authentication
  factors in the `User_attributes` column.
- To enable authentication to the MySQL server using accounts
  that require multiple passwords, client programs have
  [`--password1`](connection-options.md#option_general_password1),
  [`--password2`](connection-options.md#option_general_password2), and
  [`--password3`](connection-options.md#option_general_password3) options that
  permit up to three passwords to be specified. For
  applications that use the C API, the
  `MYSQL_OPT_USER_PASSWORD` option for the
  [`mysql_options4()`](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/c-api/8.0/en/mysql-options4.html) C API
  function enables the same capability.
- The server-side `authentication_fido`
  plugin (deprecated) enables authentication using devices.
  This server-side FIDO authentication plugin is included only
  in MySQL Enterprise Edition distributions. It is not included in MySQL
  community distributions. However, the client-side
  `authentication_fido_client` plugin
  (deprecated) is included in all distributions, including
  community distributions. This enables clients from any
  distribution to connect to accounts that use
  `authentication_fido` to authenticate on a
  server that has that plugin loaded. See
  [Section 8.4.1.11, “FIDO Pluggable Authentication”](fido-pluggable-authentication.md "8.4.1.11 FIDO Pluggable Authentication").
- `authentication_fido` also enables
  passwordless authentication, if it is the only
  authentication plugin used by an account. See
  [FIDO Passwordless Authentication](fido-pluggable-authentication.md#fido-pluggable-authentication-passwordless "FIDO Passwordless Authentication").
- Multifactor authentication can use non-FIDO MySQL
  authentication methods, the FIDO authentication method, or a
  combination of both.
- These privileges enable users to perform certain restricted
  multifactor authentication-related operations:

  - A user who has the
    [`AUTHENTICATION_POLICY_ADMIN`](privileges-provided.md#priv_authentication-policy-admin)
    privilege is not subject to the constraints imposed by
    the
    [`authentication_policy`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_authentication_policy)
    system variable. (A warning does occur for statements
    that otherwise would not be permitted.)
  - The
    [`PASSWORDLESS_USER_ADMIN`](privileges-provided.md#priv_passwordless-user-admin)
    privilege enables creation of
    passwordless-authentication accounts and replication of
    operations on them.

#### Configuring the Multifactor Authentication Policy

The [`authentication_policy`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_authentication_policy)
system variable defines the multifactor authentication policy.
Specifically, it defines how many authentication factors
accounts may have (or are required to have) and the
authentication methods that can be used for each factor.

The value of
[`authentication_policy`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_authentication_policy) is a list
of 1, 2, or 3 comma-separated elements. Each element in the list
corresponds to an authentication factor and can be an
authentication plugin name, an asterisk (`*`),
empty, or missing. (Exception: Element 1 cannot be empty or
missing.) The entire list is enclosed in single quotes. For
example, the following
[`authentication_policy`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_authentication_policy) value
includes an asterisk, an authentication plugin name, and an
empty element:

```simple
authentication_policy = '*,authentication_fido,'
```

An asterisk (`*`) indicates that an
authentication method is required but any method is permitted.
An empty element indicates that an authentication method is
optional and any method is permitted. A missing element (no
asterisk, empty element, or authentication plugin name)
indicates that an authentication method is not permitted. When a
plugin name is specified, that authentication method is required
for the respective factor when creating or modifying an account.

The default
[`authentication_policy`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_authentication_policy) value is
`'*,,'` (an asterisk and two empty elements),
which requires a first factor, and optionally permits second and
third factors. The default
[`authentication_policy`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_authentication_policy) value is
thus backward compatible with existing 1FA accounts, but also
permits creation or modification of accounts to use 2FA or 3FA.

A user who has the
[`AUTHENTICATION_POLICY_ADMIN`](privileges-provided.md#priv_authentication-policy-admin)
privilege is not subject to the constraints imposed by the
[`authentication_policy`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_authentication_policy) setting.
(A warning occurs for statements that otherwise would not be
permitted.)

[`authentication_policy`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_authentication_policy) values
can be defined in an option file or specified using a
[`SET
GLOBAL`](set-variable.md "15.7.6.1 SET Syntax for Variable Assignment") statement:

```sql
SET GLOBAL authentication_policy='*,*,';
```

There are several rules that govern how the
[`authentication_policy`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_authentication_policy) value can
be defined. Refer to the
[`authentication_policy`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_authentication_policy) system
variable description for a compete account of those rules. The
following table provides several
[`authentication_policy`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_authentication_policy) example
values and the policy established by each.

**Table 8.11 Example authentication\_policy Values**

| authentication\_policy Value | Effective Policy |
| --- | --- |
| `'*'` | Permit only creating or altering accounts with one factor. |
| `'*,*'` | Permit only creating or altering accounts with two factors. |
| `'*,*,*'` | Permit only creating or altering accounts with three factors. |
| `'*,'` | Permit creating or altering accounts with one or two factors. |
| `'*,,'` | Permit creating or altering accounts with one, two, or three factors. |
| `'*,*,'` | Permit creating or altering accounts with two or three factors. |
| `'*,auth_plugin'` | Permit creating or altering accounts with two factors, where the first factor can be any authentication method, and the second factor must be the named plugin. |
| `'auth_plugin,*,'` | Permit creating or altering accounts with two or three factors, where the first factor must be the named plugin. |
| `'auth_plugin,'` | Permit creating or altering accounts with one or two factors, where the first factor must be the named plugin. |
| `'auth_plugin,auth_plugin,auth_plugin'` | Permits creating or altering accounts with three factors, where the factors must use the named plugins. |

#### Getting Started with Multifactor Authentication

By default, MySQL uses a multifactor authentication policy that
permits any authentication plugin for the first factor, and
optionally permits second and third authentication factors. This
policy is configurable; for details, see
[Configuring the Multifactor Authentication Policy](multifactor-authentication.md#multifactor-authentication-policy "Configuring the Multifactor Authentication Policy").

Note

It is not permitted to use any internal credential storage
plugins (`caching_sha2_password` or
`mysql_native_password`) for factor 2 or 3.

Suppose that you want an account to authenticate first using the
`caching_sha2_password` plugin, then using the
`authentication_ldap_sasl` SASL LDAP plugin.
(This assumes that LDAP authentication is already set up as
described in [Section 8.4.1.7, “LDAP Pluggable Authentication”](ldap-pluggable-authentication.md "8.4.1.7 LDAP Pluggable Authentication"),
and that the user has an entry in the LDAP directory
corresponding to the authentication string shown in the
example.) Create the account using a statement like this:

```sql
CREATE USER 'alice'@'localhost'
  IDENTIFIED WITH caching_sha2_password
    BY 'sha2_password'
  AND IDENTIFIED WITH authentication_ldap_sasl
    AS 'uid=u1_ldap,ou=People,dc=example,dc=com';
```

To connect, the user must supply two passwords. To enable
authentication to the MySQL server using accounts that require
multiple passwords, client programs have
[`--password1`](connection-options.md#option_general_password1),
[`--password2`](connection-options.md#option_general_password2), and
[`--password3`](connection-options.md#option_general_password3) options that permit
up to three passwords to be specified. These options are similar
to the [`--password`](connection-options.md#option_general_password) option in that
they can take a password value following the option on the
command line (which is insecure) or if given without a password
value cause the user to be prompted for one. For the account
just created, factors 1 and 2 take passwords, so invoke the
[**mysql**](mysql.md "6.5.1 mysql — The MySQL Command-Line Client") client with the
[`--password1`](mysql-command-options.md#option_mysql_password1) and
[`--password2`](mysql-command-options.md#option_mysql_password2) options.
[**mysql**](mysql.md "6.5.1 mysql — The MySQL Command-Line Client") prompts for each password in turn:

```terminal
$> mysql --user=alice --password1 --password2
Enter password: (enter factor 1 password)
Enter password: (enter factor 2 password)
```

Suppose you want to add a third authentication factor. This can
be achieved by dropping and recreating the user with a third
factor or by using
[`ALTER USER
user ADD
factor`](alter-user.md "15.7.1.1 ALTER USER Statement") syntax. Both methods
are shown below:

```sql
DROP USER 'alice'@'localhost';

CREATE USER 'alice'@'localhost'
  IDENTIFIED WITH caching_sha2_password
    BY 'sha2_password'
  AND IDENTIFIED WITH authentication_ldap_sasl
    AS 'uid=u1_ldap,ou=People,dc=example,dc=com'
  AND IDENTIFIED WITH authentication_fido;
```

`ADD factor` syntax
includes the factor number and `FACTOR`
keyword:

```sql
ALTER USER 'alice'@'localhost' ADD 3 FACTOR IDENTIFIED WITH authentication_fido;
```

[`ALTER USER
user DROP
factor`](alter-user.md "15.7.1.1 ALTER USER Statement") syntax permits
dropping a factor. The following example drops the third factor
(`authentication_fido`) that was added in the
previous example:

```sql
ALTER USER 'alice'@'localhost' DROP 3 FACTOR;
```

[`ALTER USER
user MODIFY
factor`](alter-user.md "15.7.1.1 ALTER USER Statement") syntax permits
changing the plugin or authentication string for a particular
factor, provided that the factor exists. The following example
modifies the second factor, changing the authentication method
from `authentication_ldap_sasl` to
`authetication_fido`:

```sql
ALTER USER 'alice'@'localhost' MODIFY 2 FACTOR IDENTIFIED WITH authentication_fido;
```

Use [`SHOW CREATE USER`](show-create-user.md "15.7.7.12 SHOW CREATE USER Statement") to view the
authentication methods defined for an account:

```sql
SHOW CREATE USER 'u1'@'localhost'\G
*************************** 1. row ***************************
CREATE USER for u1@localhost: CREATE USER `u1`@`localhost`
IDENTIFIED WITH 'caching_sha2_password' AS 'sha2_password'
AND IDENTIFIED WITH 'authentication_fido' REQUIRE NONE
PASSWORD EXPIRE DEFAULT ACCOUNT UNLOCK PASSWORD HISTORY
DEFAULT PASSWORD REUSE INTERVAL DEFAULT PASSWORD REQUIRE
CURRENT DEFAULT
```
