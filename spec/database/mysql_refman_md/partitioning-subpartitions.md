### 26.2.6 Subpartitioning

Subpartitioning—also known as
composite
partitioning—is the further division of each
partition in a partitioned table. Consider the following
[`CREATE TABLE`](create-table.md "15.1.20 CREATE TABLE Statement") statement:

```sql
CREATE TABLE ts (id INT, purchased DATE)
    PARTITION BY RANGE( YEAR(purchased) )
    SUBPARTITION BY HASH( TO_DAYS(purchased) )
    SUBPARTITIONS 2 (
        PARTITION p0 VALUES LESS THAN (1990),
        PARTITION p1 VALUES LESS THAN (2000),
        PARTITION p2 VALUES LESS THAN MAXVALUE
    );
```

Table `ts` has 3 `RANGE`
partitions. Each of these
partitions—`p0`, `p1`,
and `p2`—is further divided into 2
subpartitions. In effect, the entire table is divided into
`3 * 2 = 6` partitions. However, due to the
action of the `PARTITION BY RANGE` clause, the
first 2 of these store only those records with a value less than
1990 in the `purchased` column.

It is possible to subpartition tables that are partitioned by
`RANGE` or `LIST`.
Subpartitions may use either `HASH` or
`KEY` partitioning. This is also known as
composite partitioning.

Note

`SUBPARTITION BY HASH` and
`SUBPARTITION BY KEY` generally follow the
same syntax rules as `PARTITION BY HASH` and
`PARTITION BY KEY`, respectively. An
exception to this is that `SUBPARTITION BY
KEY` (unlike `PARTITION BY KEY`)
does not currently support a default column, so the column
used for this purpose must be specified, even if the table has
an explicit primary key. This is a known issue which we are
working to address; see
[Issues with subpartitions](partitioning-limitations.md#partitioning-limitations-subpartitions "Issues with subpartitions"), for
more information and an example.

It is also possible to define subpartitions explicitly using
`SUBPARTITION` clauses to specify options for
individual subpartitions. For example, a more verbose fashion of
creating the same table `ts` as shown in the
previous example would be:

```sql
CREATE TABLE ts (id INT, purchased DATE)
    PARTITION BY RANGE( YEAR(purchased) )
    SUBPARTITION BY HASH( TO_DAYS(purchased) ) (
        PARTITION p0 VALUES LESS THAN (1990) (
            SUBPARTITION s0,
            SUBPARTITION s1
        ),
        PARTITION p1 VALUES LESS THAN (2000) (
            SUBPARTITION s2,
            SUBPARTITION s3
        ),
        PARTITION p2 VALUES LESS THAN MAXVALUE (
            SUBPARTITION s4,
            SUBPARTITION s5
        )
    );
```

Some syntactical items of note are listed here:

- Each partition must have the same number of subpartitions.
- If you explicitly define any subpartitions using
  `SUBPARTITION` on any partition of a
  partitioned table, you must define them all. In other words,
  the following statement fails:

  ```sql
  CREATE TABLE ts (id INT, purchased DATE)
      PARTITION BY RANGE( YEAR(purchased) )
      SUBPARTITION BY HASH( TO_DAYS(purchased) ) (
          PARTITION p0 VALUES LESS THAN (1990) (
              SUBPARTITION s0,
              SUBPARTITION s1
          ),
          PARTITION p1 VALUES LESS THAN (2000),
          PARTITION p2 VALUES LESS THAN MAXVALUE (
              SUBPARTITION s2,
              SUBPARTITION s3
          )
      );
  ```

  This statement would still fail even if it used
  `SUBPARTITIONS 2`.
- Each `SUBPARTITION` clause must include (at
  a minimum) a name for the subpartition. Otherwise, you may
  set any desired option for the subpartition or allow it to
  assume its default setting for that option.
- Subpartition names must be unique across the entire table.
  For example, the following [`CREATE
  TABLE`](create-table.md "15.1.20 CREATE TABLE Statement") statement is valid:

  ```sql
  CREATE TABLE ts (id INT, purchased DATE)
      PARTITION BY RANGE( YEAR(purchased) )
      SUBPARTITION BY HASH( TO_DAYS(purchased) ) (
          PARTITION p0 VALUES LESS THAN (1990) (
              SUBPARTITION s0,
              SUBPARTITION s1
          ),
          PARTITION p1 VALUES LESS THAN (2000) (
              SUBPARTITION s2,
              SUBPARTITION s3
          ),
          PARTITION p2 VALUES LESS THAN MAXVALUE (
              SUBPARTITION s4,
              SUBPARTITION s5
          )
      );
  ```
