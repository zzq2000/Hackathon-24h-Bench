#### 10.2.1.21 Window Function Optimization

Window functions affect the strategies the optimizer
considers:

- Derived table merging for a subquery is disabled if the
  subquery has window functions. The subquery is always
  materialized.
- Semijoins are not applicable to window function
  optimization because semijoins apply to subqueries in
  `WHERE` and `JOIN ...
  ON`, which cannot contain window functions.
- The optimizer processes multiple windows that have the
  same ordering requirements in sequence, so sorting can be
  skipped for windows following the first one.
- The optimizer makes no attempt to merge windows that could
  be evaluated in a single step (for example, when multiple
  `OVER` clauses contain identical window
  definitions). The workaround is to define the window in a
  `WINDOW` clause and refer to the window
  name in the `OVER` clauses.

An aggregate function not used as a window function is
aggregated in the outermost possible query. For example, in
this query, MySQL sees that `COUNT(t1.b)` is
something that cannot exist in the outer query because of its
placement in the `WHERE` clause:

```sql
SELECT * FROM t1 WHERE t1.a = (SELECT COUNT(t1.b) FROM t2);
```

Consequently, MySQL aggregates inside the subquery, treating
`t1.b` as a constant and returning the count
of rows of `t2`.

Replacing `WHERE` with
`HAVING` results in an error:

```sql
mysql> SELECT * FROM t1 HAVING t1.a = (SELECT COUNT(t1.b) FROM t2);
ERROR 1140 (42000): In aggregated query without GROUP BY, expression #1
of SELECT list contains nonaggregated column 'test.t1.a'; this is
incompatible with sql_mode=only_full_group_by
```

The error occurs because `COUNT(t1.b)` can
exist in the `HAVING`, and so makes the outer
query aggregated.

Window functions (including aggregate functions used as window
functions) do not have the preceding complexity. They always
aggregate in the subquery where they are written, never in the
outer query.

Window function evaluation may be affected by the value of the
[`windowing_use_high_precision`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_windowing_use_high_precision)
system variable, which determines whether to compute window
operations without loss of precision. By default,
[`windowing_use_high_precision`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_windowing_use_high_precision)
is enabled.

For some moving frame aggregates, the inverse aggregate
function can be applied to remove values from the aggregate.
This can improve performance but possibly with a loss of
precision. For example, adding a very small floating-point
value to a very large value causes the very small value to be
“hidden” by the large value. When inverting the
large value later, the effect of the small value is lost.

Loss of precision due to inverse aggregation is a factor only
for operations on floating-point (approximate-value) data
types. For other types, inverse aggregation is safe; this
includes [`DECIMAL`](fixed-point-types.md "13.1.3 Fixed-Point Types (Exact Value) - DECIMAL, NUMERIC"), which permits
a fractional part but is an exact-value type.

For faster execution, MySQL always uses inverse aggregation
when it is safe:

- For floating-point values, inverse aggregation is not
  always safe and might result in loss of precision. The
  default is to avoid inverse aggregation, which is slower
  but preserves precision. If it is permissible to sacrifice
  safety for speed,
  [`windowing_use_high_precision`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_windowing_use_high_precision)
  can be disabled to permit inverse aggregation.
- For nonfloating-point data types, inverse aggregation is
  always safe and is used regardless of the
  [`windowing_use_high_precision`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_windowing_use_high_precision)
  value.
- [`windowing_use_high_precision`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_windowing_use_high_precision)
  has no effect on [`MIN()`](aggregate-functions.md#function_min) and
  [`MAX()`](aggregate-functions.md#function_max), which do not use
  inverse aggregation in any case.

For evaluation of the variance functions
[`STDDEV_POP()`](aggregate-functions.md#function_stddev-pop),
[`STDDEV_SAMP()`](aggregate-functions.md#function_stddev-samp),
[`VAR_POP()`](aggregate-functions.md#function_var-pop),
[`VAR_SAMP()`](aggregate-functions.md#function_var-samp), and their synonyms,
evaluation can occur in optimized mode or default mode.
Optimized mode may produce slightly different results in the
last significant digits. If such differences are permissible,
[`windowing_use_high_precision`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_windowing_use_high_precision)
can be disabled to permit optimized mode.

For [`EXPLAIN`](explain.md "15.8.2 EXPLAIN Statement"), windowing
execution plan information is too extensive to display in
traditional output format. To see windowing information, use
[`EXPLAIN
FORMAT=JSON`](explain.md "15.8.2 EXPLAIN Statement") and look for the
`windowing` element.
