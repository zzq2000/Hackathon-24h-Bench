### 26.6.2 Partitioning Limitations Relating to Storage Engines

In MySQL 8.0, partitioning support is not actually
provided by the MySQL Server, but rather by a table storage
engine's own or native partitioning handler. In MySQL
8.0, only the [`InnoDB`](innodb-storage-engine.md "Chapter 17 The InnoDB Storage Engine")
and [`NDB`](mysql-cluster.md "Chapter 25 MySQL NDB Cluster 8.0") storage engines provide
native partitioning handlers. This means that partitioned tables
cannot be created using any other storage engine than these.
(You must be using MySQL NDB Cluster with the
`NDB` storage engine to create
`NDB` tables.)

**InnoDB storage engine.**
[`InnoDB`](innodb-storage-engine.md "Chapter 17 The InnoDB Storage Engine") foreign keys and MySQL
partitioning are not compatible. Partitioned
`InnoDB` tables cannot have foreign key
references, nor can they have columns referenced by foreign
keys. `InnoDB` tables which have or which are
referenced by foreign keys cannot be partitioned.

[`ALTER
TABLE ... OPTIMIZE PARTITION`](alter-table-partition-operations.md "15.1.9.1 ALTER TABLE Partition Operations") does not work correctly
with partitioned tables that use `InnoDB`. Use
`ALTER TABLE ... REBUILD PARTITION` and
`ALTER TABLE ... ANALYZE PARTITION`, instead,
for such tables. For more information, see
[Section 15.1.9.1, “ALTER TABLE Partition Operations”](alter-table-partition-operations.md "15.1.9.1 ALTER TABLE Partition Operations").

**User-defined partitioning and the NDB storage engine (NDB Cluster).**
Partitioning by `KEY` (including
`LINEAR KEY`) is the only type of
partitioning supported for the
[`NDB`](mysql-cluster.md "Chapter 25 MySQL NDB Cluster 8.0") storage engine. It is not
possible under normal circumstances in NDB Cluster to create
an NDB Cluster table using any partitioning type other than
[`LINEAR`] `KEY`, and
attempting to do so fails with an error.

*Exception (not for production)*: It is
possible to override this restriction by setting the
[`new`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_new) system variable on NDB
Cluster SQL nodes to `ON`. If you choose to do
this, you should be aware that tables using partitioning types
other than `[LINEAR] KEY` are not supported in
production. *In such cases, you can create and use
tables with partitioning types other than `KEY`
or `LINEAR KEY`, but you do this entirely at
your own risk*. You should also be aware that this
functionality is now deprecated and subject to removal without
further notice in a future release of NDB Cluster.

The maximum number of partitions that can be defined for an
[`NDB`](mysql-cluster.md "Chapter 25 MySQL NDB Cluster 8.0") table depends on the number of
data nodes and node groups in the cluster, the version of the
NDB Cluster software in use, and other factors. See
[NDB and user-defined partitioning](mysql-cluster-nodes-groups.md#mysql-cluster-nodes-groups-user-partitioning "NDB and user-defined partitioning"),
for more information.

The maximum amount of fixed-size data that can be stored per
partition in an `NDB` table is 128 TB.
Previously, this was 16 GB.

[`CREATE TABLE`](create-table.md "15.1.20 CREATE TABLE Statement") and
[`ALTER
TABLE`](alter-table-partition-operations.md "15.1.9.1 ALTER TABLE Partition Operations") statements that would cause a user-partitioned
[`NDB`](mysql-cluster.md "Chapter 25 MySQL NDB Cluster 8.0") table not to meet either or
both of the following two requirements are not permitted, and
fail with an error:

1. The table must have an explicit primary key.
2. All columns listed in the table's partitioning
   expression must be part of the primary key.

**Exception.**
If a user-partitioned [`NDB`](mysql-cluster.md "Chapter 25 MySQL NDB Cluster 8.0") table
is created using an empty column-list (that is, using
`PARTITION BY KEY()` or `PARTITION BY
LINEAR KEY()`), then no explicit primary key is
required.

**Partition selection.**
Partition selection is not supported for
[`NDB`](mysql-cluster.md "Chapter 25 MySQL NDB Cluster 8.0") tables. See
[Section 26.5, “Partition Selection”](partitioning-selection.md "26.5 Partition Selection"), for more
information.

**Upgrading partitioned tables.**
When performing an upgrade, tables which are partitioned by
`KEY` must be dumped and reloaded.
Partitioned tables using storage engines other than
`InnoDB` cannot be upgraded from MySQL 5.7 or
earlier to MySQL 8.0 or later; you must either drop the
partitioning from such tables with `ALTER TABLE ...
REMOVE PARTITIONING` or convert them to
`InnoDB` using `ALTER TABLE ...
ENGINE=INNODB` prior to the upgrade.

For information about converting `MyISAM`
tables to `InnoDB`, see
[Section 17.6.1.5, “Converting Tables from MyISAM to InnoDB”](converting-tables-to-innodb.md "17.6.1.5 Converting Tables from MyISAM to InnoDB").
