### 8.2.9 Reserved Accounts

One part of the MySQL installation process is data directory
initialization (see
[Section 2.9.1, “Initializing the Data Directory”](data-directory-initialization.md "2.9.1 Initializing the Data Directory")). During data
directory initialization, MySQL creates user accounts that should
be considered reserved:

- `'root'@'localhost`: Used for administrative
  purposes. This account has all privileges, is a system
  account, and can perform any operation.

  Strictly speaking, this account name is not reserved, in the
  sense that some installations rename the
  `root` account to something else to avoid
  exposing a highly privileged account with a well-known name.
- `'mysql.sys'@'localhost'`: Used as the
  `DEFINER` for
  [`sys`](sys-schema.md "Chapter 30 MySQL sys Schema") schema objects. Use of the
  `mysql.sys` account avoids problems that
  occur if a DBA renames or removes the `root`
  account. This account is locked so that it cannot be used for
  client connections.
- `'mysql.session'@'localhost'`: Used
  internally by plugins to access the server. This account is
  locked so that it cannot be used for client connections. The
  account is a system account.
- `'mysql.infoschema'@'localhost'`: Used as the
  `DEFINER` for
  [`INFORMATION_SCHEMA`](information-schema.md "Chapter 28 INFORMATION_SCHEMA Tables") views. Use of
  the `mysql.infoschema` account avoids
  problems that occur if a DBA renames or removes the root
  account. This account is locked so that it cannot be used for
  client connections.
