### 13.1.1 Numeric Data Type Syntax

For integer data types, *`M`* indicates
the minimum display width. The maximum display width is 255.
Display width is unrelated to the range of values a type can
store, as described in
[Section 13.1.6, “Numeric Type Attributes”](numeric-type-attributes.md "13.1.6 Numeric Type Attributes").

For floating-point and fixed-point data types,
*`M`* is the total number of digits that
can be stored.

As of MySQL 8.0.17, the display width attribute is deprecated
for integer data types; you should expect support for it to be
removed in a future version of MySQL.

If you specify `ZEROFILL` for a numeric column,
MySQL automatically adds the `UNSIGNED`
attribute to the column.

As of MySQL 8.0.17, the `ZEROFILL` attribute is
deprecated for numeric data types; you should expect support for
it to be removed in a future version of MySQL. Consider using an
alternative means of producing the effect of this attribute. For
example, applications could use the
[`LPAD()`](string-functions.md#function_lpad) function to zero-pad
numbers up to the desired width, or they could store the
formatted numbers in [`CHAR`](char.md "13.3.2 The CHAR and VARCHAR Types")
columns.

Numeric data types that permit the `UNSIGNED`
attribute also permit `SIGNED`. However, these
data types are signed by default, so the
`SIGNED` attribute has no effect.

As of MySQL 8.0.17, the `UNSIGNED` attribute is
deprecated for columns of type
[`FLOAT`](floating-point-types.md "13.1.4 Floating-Point Types (Approximate Value) - FLOAT, DOUBLE"),
[`DOUBLE`](floating-point-types.md "13.1.4 Floating-Point Types (Approximate Value) - FLOAT, DOUBLE"), and
[`DECIMAL`](fixed-point-types.md "13.1.3 Fixed-Point Types (Exact Value) - DECIMAL, NUMERIC") (and any synonyms); you
should expect support for it to be removed in a future version
of MySQL. Consider using a simple `CHECK`
constraint instead for such columns.

`SERIAL` is an alias for `BIGINT
UNSIGNED NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT UNIQUE`.

`SERIAL DEFAULT VALUE` in the definition of an
integer column is an alias for `NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT
UNIQUE`.

Warning

When you use subtraction between integer values where one is
of type `UNSIGNED`, the result is unsigned
unless the
[`NO_UNSIGNED_SUBTRACTION`](sql-mode.md#sqlmode_no_unsigned_subtraction) SQL
mode is enabled. See [Section 14.10, “Cast Functions and Operators”](cast-functions.md "14.10 Cast Functions and Operators").

- [`BIT[(M)]`](bit-type.md "13.1.5 Bit-Value Type - BIT")

  A bit-value type. *`M`* indicates the
  number of bits per value, from 1 to 64. The default is 1 if
  *`M`* is omitted.
- [`TINYINT[(M)]
  [UNSIGNED] [ZEROFILL]`](integer-types.md "13.1.2 Integer Types (Exact Value) - INTEGER, INT, SMALLINT, TINYINT, MEDIUMINT, BIGINT")

  A very small integer. The signed range is
  `-128` to `127`. The
  unsigned range is `0` to
  `255`.
- [`BOOL`](integer-types.md "13.1.2 Integer Types (Exact Value) - INTEGER, INT, SMALLINT, TINYINT, MEDIUMINT, BIGINT"),
  [`BOOLEAN`](integer-types.md "13.1.2 Integer Types (Exact Value) - INTEGER, INT, SMALLINT, TINYINT, MEDIUMINT, BIGINT")

  These types are synonyms for
  [`TINYINT(1)`](integer-types.md "13.1.2 Integer Types (Exact Value) - INTEGER, INT, SMALLINT, TINYINT, MEDIUMINT, BIGINT"). A value of zero
  is considered false. Nonzero values are considered true:

  ```sql
  mysql> SELECT IF(0, 'true', 'false');
  +------------------------+
  | IF(0, 'true', 'false') |
  +------------------------+
  | false                  |
  +------------------------+

  mysql> SELECT IF(1, 'true', 'false');
  +------------------------+
  | IF(1, 'true', 'false') |
  +------------------------+
  | true                   |
  +------------------------+

  mysql> SELECT IF(2, 'true', 'false');
  +------------------------+
  | IF(2, 'true', 'false') |
  +------------------------+
  | true                   |
  +------------------------+
  ```

  However, the values `TRUE` and
  `FALSE` are merely aliases for
  `1` and `0`, respectively,
  as shown here:

  ```sql
  mysql> SELECT IF(0 = FALSE, 'true', 'false');
  +--------------------------------+
  | IF(0 = FALSE, 'true', 'false') |
  +--------------------------------+
  | true                           |
  +--------------------------------+

  mysql> SELECT IF(1 = TRUE, 'true', 'false');
  +-------------------------------+
  | IF(1 = TRUE, 'true', 'false') |
  +-------------------------------+
  | true                          |
  +-------------------------------+

  mysql> SELECT IF(2 = TRUE, 'true', 'false');
  +-------------------------------+
  | IF(2 = TRUE, 'true', 'false') |
  +-------------------------------+
  | false                         |
  +-------------------------------+

  mysql> SELECT IF(2 = FALSE, 'true', 'false');
  +--------------------------------+
  | IF(2 = FALSE, 'true', 'false') |
  +--------------------------------+
  | false                          |
  +--------------------------------+
  ```

  The last two statements display the results shown because
  `2` is equal to neither
  `1` nor `0`.
- [`SMALLINT[(M)]
  [UNSIGNED] [ZEROFILL]`](integer-types.md "13.1.2 Integer Types (Exact Value) - INTEGER, INT, SMALLINT, TINYINT, MEDIUMINT, BIGINT")

  A small integer. The signed range is
  `-32768` to `32767`. The
  unsigned range is `0` to
  `65535`.
- [`MEDIUMINT[(M)]
  [UNSIGNED] [ZEROFILL]`](integer-types.md "13.1.2 Integer Types (Exact Value) - INTEGER, INT, SMALLINT, TINYINT, MEDIUMINT, BIGINT")

  A medium-sized integer. The signed range is
  `-8388608` to `8388607`.
  The unsigned range is `0` to
  `16777215`.
- [`INT[(M)]
  [UNSIGNED] [ZEROFILL]`](integer-types.md "13.1.2 Integer Types (Exact Value) - INTEGER, INT, SMALLINT, TINYINT, MEDIUMINT, BIGINT")

  A normal-size integer. The signed range is
  `-2147483648` to
  `2147483647`. The unsigned range is
  `0` to `4294967295`.
- [`INTEGER[(M)]
  [UNSIGNED] [ZEROFILL]`](integer-types.md "13.1.2 Integer Types (Exact Value) - INTEGER, INT, SMALLINT, TINYINT, MEDIUMINT, BIGINT")

  This type is a synonym for
  [`INT`](integer-types.md "13.1.2 Integer Types (Exact Value) - INTEGER, INT, SMALLINT, TINYINT, MEDIUMINT, BIGINT").
- [`BIGINT[(M)]
  [UNSIGNED] [ZEROFILL]`](integer-types.md "13.1.2 Integer Types (Exact Value) - INTEGER, INT, SMALLINT, TINYINT, MEDIUMINT, BIGINT")

  A large integer. The signed range is
  `-9223372036854775808` to
  `9223372036854775807`. The unsigned range
  is `0` to
  `18446744073709551615`.

  `SERIAL` is an alias for `BIGINT
  UNSIGNED NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT UNIQUE`.

  Some things you should be aware of with respect to
  [`BIGINT`](integer-types.md "13.1.2 Integer Types (Exact Value) - INTEGER, INT, SMALLINT, TINYINT, MEDIUMINT, BIGINT") columns:

  - All arithmetic is done using signed
    [`BIGINT`](integer-types.md "13.1.2 Integer Types (Exact Value) - INTEGER, INT, SMALLINT, TINYINT, MEDIUMINT, BIGINT") or
    [`DOUBLE`](floating-point-types.md "13.1.4 Floating-Point Types (Approximate Value) - FLOAT, DOUBLE") values, so you
    should not use unsigned big integers larger than
    `9223372036854775807` (63 bits) except
    with bit functions! If you do that, some of the last
    digits in the result may be wrong because of rounding
    errors when converting a
    [`BIGINT`](integer-types.md "13.1.2 Integer Types (Exact Value) - INTEGER, INT, SMALLINT, TINYINT, MEDIUMINT, BIGINT") value to a
    [`DOUBLE`](floating-point-types.md "13.1.4 Floating-Point Types (Approximate Value) - FLOAT, DOUBLE").

    MySQL can handle [`BIGINT`](integer-types.md "13.1.2 Integer Types (Exact Value) - INTEGER, INT, SMALLINT, TINYINT, MEDIUMINT, BIGINT")
    in the following cases:

    - When using integers to store large unsigned values
      in a [`BIGINT`](integer-types.md "13.1.2 Integer Types (Exact Value) - INTEGER, INT, SMALLINT, TINYINT, MEDIUMINT, BIGINT") column.
    - In
      [`MIN(col_name)`](aggregate-functions.md#function_min)
      or
      [`MAX(col_name)`](aggregate-functions.md#function_max),
      where *`col_name`* refers to
      a [`BIGINT`](integer-types.md "13.1.2 Integer Types (Exact Value) - INTEGER, INT, SMALLINT, TINYINT, MEDIUMINT, BIGINT") column.
    - When using operators
      ([`+`](arithmetic-functions.md#operator_plus),
      [`-`](arithmetic-functions.md#operator_minus),
      [`*`](arithmetic-functions.md#operator_times),
      and so on) where both operands are integers.
  - You can always store an exact integer value in a
    [`BIGINT`](integer-types.md "13.1.2 Integer Types (Exact Value) - INTEGER, INT, SMALLINT, TINYINT, MEDIUMINT, BIGINT") column by storing
    it using a string. In this case, MySQL performs a
    string-to-number conversion that involves no
    intermediate double-precision representation.
  - The [`-`](arithmetic-functions.md#operator_minus),
    [`+`](arithmetic-functions.md#operator_plus), and
    [`*`](arithmetic-functions.md#operator_times)
    operators use [`BIGINT`](integer-types.md "13.1.2 Integer Types (Exact Value) - INTEGER, INT, SMALLINT, TINYINT, MEDIUMINT, BIGINT")
    arithmetic when both operands are integer values. This
    means that if you multiply two big integers (or results
    from functions that return integers), you may get
    unexpected results when the result is larger than
    `9223372036854775807`.
- [`DECIMAL[(M[,D])]
  [UNSIGNED] [ZEROFILL]`](fixed-point-types.md "13.1.3 Fixed-Point Types (Exact Value) - DECIMAL, NUMERIC")

  A packed “exact” fixed-point number.
  *`M`* is the total number of digits
  (the precision) and *`D`* is the
  number of digits after the decimal point (the scale). The
  decimal point and (for negative numbers) the
  `-` sign are not counted in
  *`M`*. If
  *`D`* is 0, values have no decimal
  point or fractional part. The maximum number of digits
  (*`M`*) for
  [`DECIMAL`](fixed-point-types.md "13.1.3 Fixed-Point Types (Exact Value) - DECIMAL, NUMERIC") is 65. The maximum
  number of supported decimals (*`D`*)
  is 30. If *`D`* is omitted, the
  default is 0. If *`M`* is omitted,
  the default is 10. (There is also a limit on how long the
  text of [`DECIMAL`](fixed-point-types.md "13.1.3 Fixed-Point Types (Exact Value) - DECIMAL, NUMERIC") literals can
  be; see [Section 14.24.3, “Expression Handling”](precision-math-expressions.md "14.24.3 Expression Handling").)

  `UNSIGNED`, if specified, disallows
  negative values. As of MySQL 8.0.17, the
  `UNSIGNED` attribute is deprecated for
  columns of type [`DECIMAL`](fixed-point-types.md "13.1.3 Fixed-Point Types (Exact Value) - DECIMAL, NUMERIC") (and
  any synonyms); you should expect support for it to be
  removed in a future version of MySQL. Consider using a
  simple `CHECK` constraint instead for such
  columns.

  All basic calculations (`+, -, *, /`) with
  [`DECIMAL`](fixed-point-types.md "13.1.3 Fixed-Point Types (Exact Value) - DECIMAL, NUMERIC") columns are done with
  a precision of 65 digits.
- [`DEC[(M[,D])]
  [UNSIGNED] [ZEROFILL]`](fixed-point-types.md "13.1.3 Fixed-Point Types (Exact Value) - DECIMAL, NUMERIC"),
  [`NUMERIC[(M[,D])]
  [UNSIGNED] [ZEROFILL]`](fixed-point-types.md "13.1.3 Fixed-Point Types (Exact Value) - DECIMAL, NUMERIC"),
  [`FIXED[(M[,D])]
  [UNSIGNED] [ZEROFILL]`](fixed-point-types.md "13.1.3 Fixed-Point Types (Exact Value) - DECIMAL, NUMERIC")

  These types are synonyms for
  [`DECIMAL`](fixed-point-types.md "13.1.3 Fixed-Point Types (Exact Value) - DECIMAL, NUMERIC"). The
  [`FIXED`](fixed-point-types.md "13.1.3 Fixed-Point Types (Exact Value) - DECIMAL, NUMERIC") synonym is available
  for compatibility with other database systems.
- [`FLOAT[(M,D)]
  [UNSIGNED] [ZEROFILL]`](floating-point-types.md "13.1.4 Floating-Point Types (Approximate Value) - FLOAT, DOUBLE")

  A small (single-precision) floating-point number.
  Permissible values are `-3.402823466E+38`
  to `-1.175494351E-38`,
  `0`, and `1.175494351E-38`
  to `3.402823466E+38`. These are the
  theoretical limits, based on the IEEE standard. The actual
  range might be slightly smaller depending on your hardware
  or operating system.

  *`M`* is the total number of digits
  and *`D`* is the number of digits
  following the decimal point. If *`M`*
  and *`D`* are omitted, values are
  stored to the limits permitted by the hardware. A
  single-precision floating-point number is accurate to
  approximately 7 decimal places.

  `FLOAT(M,D)`
  is a nonstandard MySQL extension. As of MySQL 8.0.17, this
  syntax is deprecated, and you should expect support for it
  to be removed in a future version of MySQL.

  `UNSIGNED`, if specified, disallows
  negative values. As of MySQL 8.0.17, the
  `UNSIGNED` attribute is deprecated for
  columns of type [`FLOAT`](floating-point-types.md "13.1.4 Floating-Point Types (Approximate Value) - FLOAT, DOUBLE") (and
  any synonyms) and you should expect support for it to be
  removed in a future version of MySQL. Consider using a
  simple `CHECK` constraint instead for such
  columns.

  Using [`FLOAT`](floating-point-types.md "13.1.4 Floating-Point Types (Approximate Value) - FLOAT, DOUBLE") might give you
  some unexpected problems because all calculations in MySQL
  are done with double precision. See
  [Section B.3.4.7, “Solving Problems with No Matching Rows”](no-matching-rows.md "B.3.4.7 Solving Problems with No Matching Rows").
- [`FLOAT(p)
  [UNSIGNED] [ZEROFILL]`](floating-point-types.md "13.1.4 Floating-Point Types (Approximate Value) - FLOAT, DOUBLE")

  A floating-point number. *`p`*
  represents the precision in bits, but MySQL uses this value
  only to determine whether to use
  [`FLOAT`](floating-point-types.md "13.1.4 Floating-Point Types (Approximate Value) - FLOAT, DOUBLE") or
  [`DOUBLE`](floating-point-types.md "13.1.4 Floating-Point Types (Approximate Value) - FLOAT, DOUBLE") for the resulting data
  type. If *`p`* is from 0 to 24, the
  data type becomes [`FLOAT`](floating-point-types.md "13.1.4 Floating-Point Types (Approximate Value) - FLOAT, DOUBLE") with
  no *`M`* or
  *`D`* values. If
  *`p`* is from 25 to 53, the data type
  becomes [`DOUBLE`](floating-point-types.md "13.1.4 Floating-Point Types (Approximate Value) - FLOAT, DOUBLE") with no
  *`M`* or *`D`*
  values. The range of the resulting column is the same as for
  the single-precision [`FLOAT`](floating-point-types.md "13.1.4 Floating-Point Types (Approximate Value) - FLOAT, DOUBLE") or
  double-precision [`DOUBLE`](floating-point-types.md "13.1.4 Floating-Point Types (Approximate Value) - FLOAT, DOUBLE") data
  types described earlier in this section.

  `UNSIGNED`, if specified, disallows
  negative values. As of MySQL 8.0.17, the
  `UNSIGNED` attribute is deprecated for
  columns of type [`FLOAT`](floating-point-types.md "13.1.4 Floating-Point Types (Approximate Value) - FLOAT, DOUBLE") (and
  any synonyms) and you should expect support for it to be
  removed in a future version of MySQL. Consider using a
  simple `CHECK` constraint instead for such
  columns.

  [`FLOAT(p)`](floating-point-types.md "13.1.4 Floating-Point Types (Approximate Value) - FLOAT, DOUBLE")
  syntax is provided for ODBC compatibility.
- [`DOUBLE[(M,D)]
  [UNSIGNED] [ZEROFILL]`](floating-point-types.md "13.1.4 Floating-Point Types (Approximate Value) - FLOAT, DOUBLE")

  A normal-size (double-precision) floating-point number.
  Permissible values are
  `-1.7976931348623157E+308` to
  `-2.2250738585072014E-308`,
  `0`, and
  `2.2250738585072014E-308` to
  `1.7976931348623157E+308`. These are the
  theoretical limits, based on the IEEE standard. The actual
  range might be slightly smaller depending on your hardware
  or operating system.

  *`M`* is the total number of digits
  and *`D`* is the number of digits
  following the decimal point. If *`M`*
  and *`D`* are omitted, values are
  stored to the limits permitted by the hardware. A
  double-precision floating-point number is accurate to
  approximately 15 decimal places.

  `DOUBLE(M,D)`
  is a nonstandard MySQL extension. As of MySQL 8.0.17, this
  syntax is deprecated and you should expect support for it to
  be removed in a future version of MySQL.

  `UNSIGNED`, if specified, disallows
  negative values. As of MySQL 8.0.17, the
  `UNSIGNED` attribute is deprecated for

  [`REAL[(M,D)]
  [UNSIGNED] [ZEROFILL]`](floating-point-types.md "13.1.4 Floating-Point Types (Approximate Value) - FLOAT, DOUBLE")

  These types are synonyms for
  [`DOUBLE`](floating-point-types.md "13.1.4 Floating-Point Types (Approximate Value) - FLOAT, DOUBLE"). Exception: If the
  [`REAL_AS_FLOAT`](sql-mode.md#sqlmode_real_as_float) SQL mode is
  enabled, [`REAL`](floating-point-types.md "13.1.4 Floating-Point Types (Approximate Value) - FLOAT, DOUBLE") is a synonym
  for [`FLOAT`](floating-point-types.md "13.1.4 Floating-Point Types (Approximate Value) - FLOAT, DOUBLE") rather than
  [`DOUBLE`](floating-point-types.md "13.1.4 Floating-Point Types (Approximate Value) - FLOAT, DOUBLE").
