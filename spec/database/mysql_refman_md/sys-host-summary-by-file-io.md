#### 30.4.3.2 The host\_summary\_by\_file\_io and x$host\_summary\_by\_file\_io Views

These views summarize file I/O, grouped by host. By default,
rows are sorted by descending total file I/O latency.

The [`host_summary_by_file_io`](sys-host-summary-by-file-io.md "30.4.3.2 The host_summary_by_file_io and x$host_summary_by_file_io Views") and
[`x$host_summary_by_file_io`](sys-host-summary-by-file-io.md "30.4.3.2 The host_summary_by_file_io and x$host_summary_by_file_io Views") views
have these columns:

- `host`

  The host from which the client connected. Rows for which
  the `HOST` column in the underlying
  Performance Schema table is `NULL` are
  assumed to be for background threads and are reported with
  a host name of `background`.
- `ios`

  The total number of file I/O events for the host.
- `io_latency`

  The total wait time of timed file I/O events for the host.
