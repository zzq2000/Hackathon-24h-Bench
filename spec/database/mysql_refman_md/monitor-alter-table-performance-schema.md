### 17.16.1 Monitoring ALTER TABLE Progress for InnoDB Tables Using Performance Schema

You can monitor [`ALTER TABLE`](alter-table.md "15.1.9 ALTER TABLE Statement")
progress for `InnoDB` tables using
[Performance Schema](performance-schema.md "Chapter 29 MySQL Performance Schema").

There are seven stage events that represent different phases of
[`ALTER TABLE`](alter-table.md "15.1.9 ALTER TABLE Statement"). Each stage event
reports a running total of `WORK_COMPLETED` and
`WORK_ESTIMATED` for the overall
[`ALTER TABLE`](alter-table.md "15.1.9 ALTER TABLE Statement") operation as it
progresses through its different phases.
`WORK_ESTIMATED` is calculated using a formula
that takes into account all of the work that
[`ALTER TABLE`](alter-table.md "15.1.9 ALTER TABLE Statement") performs, and may be
revised during [`ALTER TABLE`](alter-table.md "15.1.9 ALTER TABLE Statement")
processing. `WORK_COMPLETED` and
`WORK_ESTIMATED` values are an abstract
representation of all of the work performed by
[`ALTER TABLE`](alter-table.md "15.1.9 ALTER TABLE Statement").

In order of occurrence, [`ALTER TABLE`](alter-table.md "15.1.9 ALTER TABLE Statement")
stage events include:

- `stage/innodb/alter table (read PK and internal
  sort)`: This stage is active when
  [`ALTER TABLE`](alter-table.md "15.1.9 ALTER TABLE Statement") is in the
  reading-primary-key phase. It starts with
  `WORK_COMPLETED=0` and
  `WORK_ESTIMATED` set to the estimated number
  of pages in the primary key. When the stage is completed,
  `WORK_ESTIMATED` is updated to the actual
  number of pages in the primary key.
- `stage/innodb/alter table (merge sort)`: This
  stage is repeated for each index added by the
  [`ALTER TABLE`](alter-table.md "15.1.9 ALTER TABLE Statement") operation.
- `stage/innodb/alter table (insert)`: This
  stage is repeated for each index added by the
  [`ALTER TABLE`](alter-table.md "15.1.9 ALTER TABLE Statement") operation.
- `stage/innodb/alter table (log apply index)`:
  This stage includes the application of DML log generated while
  [`ALTER TABLE`](alter-table.md "15.1.9 ALTER TABLE Statement") was running.
- `stage/innodb/alter table (flush)`: Before
  this stage begins, `WORK_ESTIMATED` is
  updated with a more accurate estimate, based on the length of
  the flush list.
- `stage/innodb/alter table (log apply table)`:
  This stage includes the application of concurrent DML log
  generated while [`ALTER TABLE`](alter-table.md "15.1.9 ALTER TABLE Statement") was
  running. The duration of this phase depends on the extent of
  table changes. This phase is instant if no concurrent DML was
  run on the table.
- `stage/innodb/alter table (end)`: Includes
  any remaining work that appeared after the flush phase, such
  as reapplying DML that was executed on the table while
  [`ALTER TABLE`](alter-table.md "15.1.9 ALTER TABLE Statement") was running.

Note

`InnoDB` [`ALTER
TABLE`](alter-table.md "15.1.9 ALTER TABLE Statement") stage events do not currently account for the
addition of spatial indexes.

#### ALTER TABLE Monitoring Example Using Performance Schema

The following example demonstrates how to enable the
`stage/innodb/alter table%` stage event
instruments and related consumer tables to monitor
[`ALTER TABLE`](alter-table.md "15.1.9 ALTER TABLE Statement") progress. For
information about Performance Schema stage event instruments and
related consumers, see
[Section 29.12.5, “Performance Schema Stage Event Tables”](performance-schema-stage-tables.md "29.12.5 Performance Schema Stage Event Tables").

1. Enable the `stage/innodb/alter%` instruments:

   ```sql
   mysql> UPDATE performance_schema.setup_instruments
          SET ENABLED = 'YES'
          WHERE NAME LIKE 'stage/innodb/alter%';
   Query OK, 7 rows affected (0.00 sec)
   Rows matched: 7  Changed: 7  Warnings: 0
   ```
2. Enable the stage event consumer tables, which include
   [`events_stages_current`](performance-schema-events-stages-current-table.md "29.12.5.1 The events_stages_current Table"),
   [`events_stages_history`](performance-schema-events-stages-history-table.md "29.12.5.2 The events_stages_history Table"), and
   [`events_stages_history_long`](performance-schema-events-stages-history-long-table.md "29.12.5.3 The events_stages_history_long Table").

   ```sql
   mysql> UPDATE performance_schema.setup_consumers
          SET ENABLED = 'YES'
          WHERE NAME LIKE '%stages%';
   Query OK, 3 rows affected (0.00 sec)
   Rows matched: 3  Changed: 3  Warnings: 0
   ```
3. Run an [`ALTER TABLE`](alter-table.md "15.1.9 ALTER TABLE Statement") operation.
   In this example, a `middle_name` column is
   added to the employees table of the employees sample database.

   ```sql
   mysql> ALTER TABLE employees.employees ADD COLUMN middle_name varchar(14) AFTER first_name;
   Query OK, 0 rows affected (9.27 sec)
   Records: 0  Duplicates: 0  Warnings: 0
   ```
4. Check the progress of the [`ALTER
   TABLE`](alter-table.md "15.1.9 ALTER TABLE Statement") operation by querying the Performance Schema
   [`events_stages_current`](performance-schema-events-stages-current-table.md "29.12.5.1 The events_stages_current Table") table. The
   stage event shown differs depending on which
   [`ALTER TABLE`](alter-table.md "15.1.9 ALTER TABLE Statement") phase is currently
   in progress. The `WORK_COMPLETED` column
   shows the work completed. The
   `WORK_ESTIMATED` column provides an estimate
   of the remaining work.

   ```sql
   mysql> SELECT EVENT_NAME, WORK_COMPLETED, WORK_ESTIMATED
          FROM performance_schema.events_stages_current;
   +------------------------------------------------------+----------------+----------------+
   | EVENT_NAME                                           | WORK_COMPLETED | WORK_ESTIMATED |
   +------------------------------------------------------+----------------+----------------+
   | stage/innodb/alter table (read PK and internal sort) |            280 |           1245 |
   +------------------------------------------------------+----------------+----------------+
   1 row in set (0.01 sec)
   ```

   The [`events_stages_current`](performance-schema-events-stages-current-table.md "29.12.5.1 The events_stages_current Table") table
   returns an empty set if the [`ALTER
   TABLE`](alter-table.md "15.1.9 ALTER TABLE Statement") operation has completed. In this case, you can
   check the [`events_stages_history`](performance-schema-events-stages-history-table.md "29.12.5.2 The events_stages_history Table")
   table to view event data for the completed operation. For
   example:

   ```sql
   mysql> SELECT EVENT_NAME, WORK_COMPLETED, WORK_ESTIMATED
          FROM performance_schema.events_stages_history;
   +------------------------------------------------------+----------------+----------------+
   | EVENT_NAME                                           | WORK_COMPLETED | WORK_ESTIMATED |
   +------------------------------------------------------+----------------+----------------+
   | stage/innodb/alter table (read PK and internal sort) |            886 |           1213 |
   | stage/innodb/alter table (flush)                     |           1213 |           1213 |
   | stage/innodb/alter table (log apply table)           |           1597 |           1597 |
   | stage/innodb/alter table (end)                       |           1597 |           1597 |
   | stage/innodb/alter table (log apply table)           |           1981 |           1981 |
   +------------------------------------------------------+----------------+----------------+
   5 rows in set (0.00 sec)
   ```

   As shown above, the `WORK_ESTIMATED` value
   was revised during `ALTER TABLE` processing.
   The estimated work after completion of the initial stage is
   1213. When `ALTER TABLE` processing
   completed, `WORK_ESTIMATED` was set to the
   actual value, which is 1981.
