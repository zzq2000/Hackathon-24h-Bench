### 22.5.3 Using Encrypted Connections with X Plugin

This section explains how to configure X Plugin to use encrypted
connections. For more background information, see
[Section 8.3, “Using Encrypted Connections”](encrypted-connections.md "8.3 Using Encrypted Connections").

To enable configuring support for encrypted connections, X Plugin
has `mysqlx_ssl_xxx`
system variables, which can have different values from the
`ssl_xxx` system
variables used with MySQL Server. For example, X Plugin can have
SSL key, certificate, and certificate authority files that differ
from those used for MySQL Server. These variables are described at
[Section 22.5.6.2, “X Plugin Options and System Variables”](x-plugin-options-system-variables.md "22.5.6.2 X Plugin Options and System Variables"). Similarly,
X Plugin has its own
`Mysqlx_ssl_xxx`
status variables that correspond to the MySQL Server
encrypted-connection
`Ssl_xxx` status
variables. See [Section 22.5.6.3, “X Plugin Status Variables”](x-plugin-status-variables.md "22.5.6.3 X Plugin Status Variables").

At initialization, X Plugin determines its TLS context for
encrypted connections as follows:

- If all
  `mysqlx_ssl_xxx`
  system variables have their default values, X Plugin uses the
  same TLS context as the MySQL Server main connection
  interface, which is determined by the values of the
  `ssl_xxx` system
  variables.
- If any
  `mysqlx_ssl_xxx`
  variable has a nondefault value, X Plugin uses the TLS
  context defined by the values of its own system variables.
  (This is the case if any
  `mysqlx_ssl_xxx`
  system variable is set to a value different from its default.)

This means that, on a server with X Plugin enabled, you can
choose to have MySQL Protocol and X Protocol connections share
the same encryption configuration by setting only the
`ssl_xxx` variables,
or have separate encryption configurations for MySQL Protocol and
X Protocol connections by configuring the
`ssl_xxx` and
`mysqlx_ssl_xxx`
variables separately.

To have MySQL Protocol and X Protocol connections use the same
encryption configuration, set only the
`ssl_xxx` system
variables in `my.cnf`:

```ini
[mysqld]
ssl_ca=ca.pem
ssl_cert=server-cert.pem
ssl_key=server-key.pem
```

To configure encryption separately for MySQL Protocol and
X Protocol connections, set both the
`ssl_xxx` and
`mysqlx_ssl_xxx`
system variables in `my.cnf`:

```ini
[mysqld]
ssl_ca=ca1.pem
ssl_cert=server-cert1.pem
ssl_key=server-key1.pem

mysqlx_ssl_ca=ca2.pem
mysqlx_ssl_cert=server-cert2.pem
mysqlx_ssl_key=server-key2.pem
```

For general information about configuring connection-encryption
support, see [Section 8.3.1, “Configuring MySQL to Use Encrypted Connections”](using-encrypted-connections.md "8.3.1 Configuring MySQL to Use Encrypted Connections"). That
discussion is written for MySQL Server, but the parameter names
are similar for X Plugin. (The X Plugin
`mysqlx_ssl_xxx`
system variable names correspond to the MySQL Server
`ssl_xxx` system
variable names.)

The [`tls_version`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_tls_version) system variable
that determines the permitted TLS versions for MySQL Protocol
connections also applies to X Protocol connections. The permitted
TLS versions for both types of connections are therefore the same.

Encryption per connection is optional, but a specific user can be
required to use encryption for X Protocol and MySQL Protocol
connections by including an appropriate `REQUIRE`
clause in the [`CREATE USER`](create-user.md "15.7.1.3 CREATE USER Statement") statement
that creates the user. For details, see
[Section 15.7.1.3, “CREATE USER Statement”](create-user.md "15.7.1.3 CREATE USER Statement"). Alternatively, to require all users
to use encryption for X Protocol and MySQL Protocol connections,
enable the
[`require_secure_transport`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_require_secure_transport) system
variable. For additional information, see
[Configuring Encrypted Connections as Mandatory](using-encrypted-connections.md#mandatory-encrypted-connections "Configuring Encrypted Connections as Mandatory").
