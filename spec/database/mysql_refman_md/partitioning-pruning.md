## 26.4 Partition Pruning

The optimization known as partition
pruning is based on a relatively simple concept which
can be described as “Do not scan partitions where there can
be no matching values”. Suppose a partitioned table
`t1` is created by this statement:

```sql
CREATE TABLE t1 (
    fname VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
    lname VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
    region_code TINYINT UNSIGNED NOT NULL,
    dob DATE NOT NULL
)
PARTITION BY RANGE( region_code ) (
    PARTITION p0 VALUES LESS THAN (64),
    PARTITION p1 VALUES LESS THAN (128),
    PARTITION p2 VALUES LESS THAN (192),
    PARTITION p3 VALUES LESS THAN MAXVALUE
);
```

Suppose that you wish to obtain results from a
[`SELECT`](select.md "15.2.13 SELECT Statement") statement such as this one:

```sql
SELECT fname, lname, region_code, dob
    FROM t1
    WHERE region_code > 125 AND region_code < 130;
```

It is easy to see that none of the rows which ought to be returned
are in either of the partitions `p0` or
`p3`; that is, we need search only in partitions
`p1` and `p2` to find matching
rows. By limiting the search, it is possible to expend much less
time and effort in finding matching rows than by scanning all
partitions in the table. This “cutting away” of
unneeded partitions is known as
pruning. When the optimizer
can make use of partition pruning in performing this query,
execution of the query can be an order of magnitude faster than
the same query against a nonpartitioned table containing the same
column definitions and data.

The optimizer can perform pruning whenever a
`WHERE` condition can be reduced to either one of
the following two cases:

- `partition_column =
  constant`
- `partition_column IN
  (constant1,
  constant2, ...,
  constantN)`

In the first case, the optimizer simply evaluates the partitioning
expression for the value given, determines which partition
contains that value, and scans only this partition. In many cases,
the equal sign can be replaced with another arithmetic comparison,
including `<`, `>`,
`<=`, `>=`, and
`<>`. Some queries using
`BETWEEN` in the `WHERE` clause
can also take advantage of partition pruning. See the examples
later in this section.

In the second case, the optimizer evaluates the partitioning
expression for each value in the list, creates a list of matching
partitions, and then scans only the partitions in this partition
list.

[`SELECT`](select.md "15.2.13 SELECT Statement"),
[`DELETE`](delete.md "15.2.2 DELETE Statement"), and
[`UPDATE`](update.md "15.2.17 UPDATE Statement") statements support partition
pruning. An [`INSERT`](insert.md "15.2.7 INSERT Statement") statement also
accesses only one partition per inserted row; this is true even
for a table that is partitioned by `HASH` or
`KEY` although this is not currently shown in the
output of [`EXPLAIN`](explain.md "15.8.2 EXPLAIN Statement").

Pruning can also be applied to short ranges, which the optimizer
can convert into equivalent lists of values. For instance, in the
previous example, the `WHERE` clause can be
converted to `WHERE region_code IN (126, 127, 128,
129)`. Then the optimizer can determine that the first
two values in the list are found in partition
`p1`, the remaining two values in partition
`p2`, and that the other partitions contain no
relevant values and so do not need to be searched for matching
rows.

The optimizer can also perform pruning for
`WHERE` conditions that involve comparisons of
the preceding types on multiple columns for tables that use
`RANGE COLUMNS` or `LIST
COLUMNS` partitioning.

This type of optimization can be applied whenever the partitioning
expression consists of an equality or a range which can be reduced
to a set of equalities, or when the partitioning expression
represents an increasing or decreasing relationship. Pruning can
also be applied for tables partitioned on a
[`DATE`](datetime.md "13.2.2 The DATE, DATETIME, and TIMESTAMP Types") or
[`DATETIME`](datetime.md "13.2.2 The DATE, DATETIME, and TIMESTAMP Types") column when the
partitioning expression uses the
[`YEAR()`](date-and-time-functions.md#function_year) or
[`TO_DAYS()`](date-and-time-functions.md#function_to-days) function. Pruning can
also be applied for such tables when the partitioning expression
uses the [`TO_SECONDS()`](date-and-time-functions.md#function_to-seconds) function.

Suppose that table `t2`, partitioned on a
[`DATE`](datetime.md "13.2.2 The DATE, DATETIME, and TIMESTAMP Types") column, is created using the
statement shown here:

```sql
CREATE TABLE t2 (
    fname VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
    lname VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
    region_code TINYINT UNSIGNED NOT NULL,
    dob DATE NOT NULL
)
PARTITION BY RANGE( YEAR(dob) ) (
    PARTITION d0 VALUES LESS THAN (1970),
    PARTITION d1 VALUES LESS THAN (1975),
    PARTITION d2 VALUES LESS THAN (1980),
    PARTITION d3 VALUES LESS THAN (1985),
    PARTITION d4 VALUES LESS THAN (1990),
    PARTITION d5 VALUES LESS THAN (2000),
    PARTITION d6 VALUES LESS THAN (2005),
    PARTITION d7 VALUES LESS THAN MAXVALUE
);
```

The following statements using `t2` can make of
use partition pruning:

```sql
SELECT * FROM t2 WHERE dob = '1982-06-23';

UPDATE t2 SET region_code = 8 WHERE dob BETWEEN '1991-02-15' AND '1997-04-25';

DELETE FROM t2 WHERE dob >= '1984-06-21' AND dob <= '1999-06-21'
```

In the case of the last statement, the optimizer can also act as
follows:

1. *Find the partition containing the low end of the
   range*.

   [`YEAR('1984-06-21')`](date-and-time-functions.md#function_year) yields the
   value `1984`, which is found in partition
   `d3`.
2. *Find the partition containing the high end of the
   range*.

   [`YEAR('1999-06-21')`](date-and-time-functions.md#function_year) evaluates to
   `1999`, which is found in partition
   `d5`.
3. *Scan only these two partitions and any partitions
   that may lie between them*.

   In this case, this means that only partitions
   `d3`, `d4`, and
   `d5` are scanned. The remaining partitions
   may be safely ignored (and are ignored).

Important

Invalid `DATE` and `DATETIME`
values referenced in the `WHERE` condition of a
statement against a partitioned table are treated as
`NULL`. This means that a query such as
`SELECT * FROM
partitioned_table WHERE
date_column <
'2008-12-00'` does not return any values (see Bug
#40972).

So far, we have looked only at examples using
`RANGE` partitioning, but pruning can be applied
with other partitioning types as well.

Consider a table that is partitioned by `LIST`,
where the partitioning expression is increasing or decreasing,
such as the table `t3` shown here. (In this
example, we assume for the sake of brevity that the
`region_code` column is limited to values between
1 and 10 inclusive.)

```sql
CREATE TABLE t3 (
    fname VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
    lname VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
    region_code TINYINT UNSIGNED NOT NULL,
    dob DATE NOT NULL
)
PARTITION BY LIST(region_code) (
    PARTITION r0 VALUES IN (1, 3),
    PARTITION r1 VALUES IN (2, 5, 8),
    PARTITION r2 VALUES IN (4, 9),
    PARTITION r3 VALUES IN (6, 7, 10)
);
```

For a statement such as `SELECT * FROM t3 WHERE
region_code BETWEEN 1 AND 3`, the optimizer determines in
which partitions the values 1, 2, and 3 are found
(`r0` and `r1`) and skips the
remaining ones (`r2` and `r3`).

For tables that are partitioned by `HASH` or
`[LINEAR] KEY`, partition pruning is also
possible in cases in which the `WHERE` clause
uses a simple `=` relation against a column used
in the partitioning expression. Consider a table created like
this:

```sql
CREATE TABLE t4 (
    fname VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
    lname VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
    region_code TINYINT UNSIGNED NOT NULL,
    dob DATE NOT NULL
)
PARTITION BY KEY(region_code)
PARTITIONS 8;
```

A statement that compares a column value with a constant can be
pruned:

```sql
UPDATE t4 WHERE region_code = 7;
```

Pruning can also be employed for short ranges, because the
optimizer can turn such conditions into `IN`
relations. For example, using the same table `t4`
as defined previously, queries such as these can be pruned:

```sql
SELECT * FROM t4 WHERE region_code > 2 AND region_code < 6;

SELECT * FROM t4 WHERE region_code BETWEEN 3 AND 5;
```

In both these cases, the `WHERE` clause is
transformed by the optimizer into `WHERE region_code IN
(3, 4, 5)`.

Important

This optimization is used only if the range size is smaller than
the number of partitions. Consider this statement:

```sql
DELETE FROM t4 WHERE region_code BETWEEN 4 AND 12;
```

The range in the `WHERE` clause covers 9 values
(4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12), but `t4` has
only 8 partitions. This means that the `DELETE`
cannot be pruned.

When a table is partitioned by `HASH` or
`[LINEAR] KEY`, pruning can be used only on
integer columns. For example, this statement cannot use pruning
because `dob` is a
[`DATE`](datetime.md "13.2.2 The DATE, DATETIME, and TIMESTAMP Types") column:

```sql
SELECT * FROM t4 WHERE dob >= '2001-04-14' AND dob <= '2005-10-15';
```

However, if the table stores year values in an
[`INT`](integer-types.md "13.1.2 Integer Types (Exact Value) - INTEGER, INT, SMALLINT, TINYINT, MEDIUMINT, BIGINT") column, then a query having
`WHERE year_col >= 2001 AND year_col <=
2005` can be pruned.

Tables using a storage engine that provides automatic
partitioning, such as the `NDB` storage engine
used by MySQL Cluster can be pruned if they are explicitly
partitioned.
