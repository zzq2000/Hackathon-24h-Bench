### 15.1.3 ALTER EVENT Statement

```sql
ALTER
    [DEFINER = user]
    EVENT event_name
    [ON SCHEDULE schedule]
    [ON COMPLETION [NOT] PRESERVE]
    [RENAME TO new_event_name]
    [ENABLE | DISABLE | DISABLE ON SLAVE]
    [COMMENT 'string']
    [DO event_body]
```

The [`ALTER EVENT`](alter-event.md "15.1.3 ALTER EVENT Statement") statement changes
one or more of the characteristics of an existing event without
the need to drop and recreate it. The syntax for each of the
`DEFINER`, `ON SCHEDULE`,
`ON COMPLETION`, `COMMENT`,
`ENABLE` / `DISABLE`, and
[`DO`](do.md "15.2.3 DO Statement") clauses is exactly the same as
when used with [`CREATE EVENT`](create-event.md "15.1.13 CREATE EVENT Statement"). (See
[Section 15.1.13, “CREATE EVENT Statement”](create-event.md "15.1.13 CREATE EVENT Statement").)

Any user can alter an event defined on a database for which that
user has the [`EVENT`](privileges-provided.md#priv_event) privilege. When
a user executes a successful [`ALTER
EVENT`](alter-event.md "15.1.3 ALTER EVENT Statement") statement, that user becomes the definer for the
affected event.

[`ALTER EVENT`](alter-event.md "15.1.3 ALTER EVENT Statement") works only with an
existing event:

```sql
mysql> ALTER EVENT no_such_event
     >     ON SCHEDULE
     >       EVERY '2:3' DAY_HOUR;
ERROR 1517 (HY000): Unknown event 'no_such_event'
```

In each of the following examples, assume that the event named
`myevent` is defined as shown here:

```sql
CREATE EVENT myevent
    ON SCHEDULE
      EVERY 6 HOUR
    COMMENT 'A sample comment.'
    DO
      UPDATE myschema.mytable SET mycol = mycol + 1;
```

The following statement changes the schedule for
`myevent` from once every six hours starting
immediately to once every twelve hours, starting four hours from
the time the statement is run:

```sql
ALTER EVENT myevent
    ON SCHEDULE
      EVERY 12 HOUR
    STARTS CURRENT_TIMESTAMP + INTERVAL 4 HOUR;
```

It is possible to change multiple characteristics of an event in a
single statement. This example changes the SQL statement executed
by `myevent` to one that deletes all records from
`mytable`; it also changes the schedule for the
event such that it executes once, one day after this
[`ALTER EVENT`](alter-event.md "15.1.3 ALTER EVENT Statement") statement is run.

```sql
ALTER EVENT myevent
    ON SCHEDULE
      AT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP + INTERVAL 1 DAY
    DO
      TRUNCATE TABLE myschema.mytable;
```

Specify the options in an [`ALTER
EVENT`](alter-event.md "15.1.3 ALTER EVENT Statement") statement only for those characteristics that you
want to change; omitted options keep their existing values. This
includes any default values for [`CREATE
EVENT`](create-event.md "15.1.13 CREATE EVENT Statement") such as `ENABLE`.

To disable `myevent`, use this
[`ALTER EVENT`](alter-event.md "15.1.3 ALTER EVENT Statement") statement:

```sql
ALTER EVENT myevent
    DISABLE;
```

The `ON SCHEDULE` clause may use expressions
involving built-in MySQL functions and user variables to obtain
any of the *`timestamp`* or
*`interval`* values which it contains. You
cannot use stored routines or loadable functions in such
expressions, and you cannot use any table references; however, you
can use `SELECT FROM DUAL`. This is true for both
[`ALTER EVENT`](alter-event.md "15.1.3 ALTER EVENT Statement") and
[`CREATE EVENT`](create-event.md "15.1.13 CREATE EVENT Statement") statements. References
to stored routines, loadable functions, and tables in such cases
are specifically not permitted, and fail with an error (see Bug
#22830).

Although an [`ALTER EVENT`](alter-event.md "15.1.3 ALTER EVENT Statement") statement
that contains another [`ALTER EVENT`](alter-event.md "15.1.3 ALTER EVENT Statement")
statement in its [`DO`](do.md "15.2.3 DO Statement") clause appears
to succeed, when the server attempts to execute the resulting
scheduled event, the execution fails with an error.

To rename an event, use the [`ALTER
EVENT`](alter-event.md "15.1.3 ALTER EVENT Statement") statement's `RENAME TO` clause.
This statement renames the event `myevent` to
`yourevent`:

```sql
ALTER EVENT myevent
    RENAME TO yourevent;
```

You can also move an event to a different database using
`ALTER EVENT ... RENAME TO ...` and
`db_name.event_name`
notation, as shown here:

```sql
ALTER EVENT olddb.myevent
    RENAME TO newdb.myevent;
```

To execute the previous statement, the user executing it must have
the [`EVENT`](privileges-provided.md#priv_event) privilege on both the
`olddb` and `newdb` databases.

Note

There is no `RENAME EVENT` statement.

The value `DISABLE ON SLAVE` is used on a replica
instead of `ENABLE` or `DISABLE`
to indicate an event that was created on the replication source
server and replicated to the replica, but that is not executed on
the replica. Normally, `DISABLE ON SLAVE` is set
automatically as required; however, there are some circumstances
under which you may want or need to change it manually. See
[Section 19.5.1.16, “Replication of Invoked Features”](replication-features-invoked.md "19.5.1.16 Replication of Invoked Features"), for more
information.
