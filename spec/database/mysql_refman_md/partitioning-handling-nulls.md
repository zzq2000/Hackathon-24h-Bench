### 26.2.7 How MySQL Partitioning Handles NULL

Partitioning in MySQL does nothing to disallow
`NULL` as the value of a partitioning
expression, whether it is a column value or the value of a
user-supplied expression. Even though it is permitted to use
`NULL` as the value of an expression that must
otherwise yield an integer, it is important to keep in mind that
`NULL` is not a number. MySQL's
partitioning implementation treats `NULL` as
being less than any non-`NULL` value, just as
`ORDER BY` does.

This means that treatment of `NULL` varies
between partitioning of different types, and may produce
behavior which you do not expect if you are not prepared for it.
This being the case, we discuss in this section how each MySQL
partitioning type handles `NULL` values when
determining the partition in which a row should be stored, and
provide examples for each.

**Handling of NULL with RANGE partitioning.**
If you insert a row into a table partitioned by
`RANGE` such that the column value used to
determine the partition is `NULL`, the row is
inserted into the lowest partition. Consider these two tables
in a database named `p`, created as follows:

```sql
mysql> CREATE TABLE t1 (
    ->     c1 INT,
    ->     c2 VARCHAR(20)
    -> )
    -> PARTITION BY RANGE(c1) (
    ->     PARTITION p0 VALUES LESS THAN (0),
    ->     PARTITION p1 VALUES LESS THAN (10),
    ->     PARTITION p2 VALUES LESS THAN MAXVALUE
    -> );
Query OK, 0 rows affected (0.09 sec)

mysql> CREATE TABLE t2 (
    ->     c1 INT,
    ->     c2 VARCHAR(20)
    -> )
    -> PARTITION BY RANGE(c1) (
    ->     PARTITION p0 VALUES LESS THAN (-5),
    ->     PARTITION p1 VALUES LESS THAN (0),
    ->     PARTITION p2 VALUES LESS THAN (10),
    ->     PARTITION p3 VALUES LESS THAN MAXVALUE
    -> );
Query OK, 0 rows affected (0.09 sec)
```

You can see the partitions created by these two
[`CREATE TABLE`](create-table.md "15.1.20 CREATE TABLE Statement") statements using the
following query against the
[`PARTITIONS`](information-schema-partitions-table.md "28.3.21 The INFORMATION_SCHEMA PARTITIONS Table") table in the
`INFORMATION_SCHEMA` database:

```sql
mysql> SELECT TABLE_NAME, PARTITION_NAME, TABLE_ROWS, AVG_ROW_LENGTH, DATA_LENGTH
     >   FROM INFORMATION_SCHEMA.PARTITIONS
     >   WHERE TABLE_SCHEMA = 'p' AND TABLE_NAME LIKE 't_';
+------------+----------------+------------+----------------+-------------+
| TABLE_NAME | PARTITION_NAME | TABLE_ROWS | AVG_ROW_LENGTH | DATA_LENGTH |
+------------+----------------+------------+----------------+-------------+
| t1         | p0             |          0 |              0 |           0 |
| t1         | p1             |          0 |              0 |           0 |
| t1         | p2             |          0 |              0 |           0 |
| t2         | p0             |          0 |              0 |           0 |
| t2         | p1             |          0 |              0 |           0 |
| t2         | p2             |          0 |              0 |           0 |
| t2         | p3             |          0 |              0 |           0 |
+------------+----------------+------------+----------------+-------------+
7 rows in set (0.00 sec)
```

(For more information about this table, see
[Section 28.3.21, “The INFORMATION\_SCHEMA PARTITIONS Table”](information-schema-partitions-table.md "28.3.21 The INFORMATION_SCHEMA PARTITIONS Table").) Now let
us populate each of these tables with a single row containing a
`NULL` in the column used as the partitioning
key, and verify that the rows were inserted using a pair of
[`SELECT`](select.md "15.2.13 SELECT Statement") statements:

```sql
mysql> INSERT INTO t1 VALUES (NULL, 'mothra');
Query OK, 1 row affected (0.00 sec)

mysql> INSERT INTO t2 VALUES (NULL, 'mothra');
Query OK, 1 row affected (0.00 sec)

mysql> SELECT * FROM t1;
+------+--------+
| id   | name   |
+------+--------+
| NULL | mothra |
+------+--------+
1 row in set (0.00 sec)

mysql> SELECT * FROM t2;
+------+--------+
| id   | name   |
+------+--------+
| NULL | mothra |
+------+--------+
1 row in set (0.00 sec)
```

You can see which partitions are used to store the inserted rows
by rerunning the previous query against
[`INFORMATION_SCHEMA.PARTITIONS`](information-schema-partitions-table.md "28.3.21 The INFORMATION_SCHEMA PARTITIONS Table") and
inspecting the output:

```sql
mysql> SELECT TABLE_NAME, PARTITION_NAME, TABLE_ROWS, AVG_ROW_LENGTH, DATA_LENGTH
     >   FROM INFORMATION_SCHEMA.PARTITIONS
     >   WHERE TABLE_SCHEMA = 'p' AND TABLE_NAME LIKE 't_';
+------------+----------------+------------+----------------+-------------+
| TABLE_NAME | PARTITION_NAME | TABLE_ROWS | AVG_ROW_LENGTH | DATA_LENGTH |
+------------+----------------+------------+----------------+-------------+
| t1         | p0             |          1 |             20 |          20 |
| t1         | p1             |          0 |              0 |           0 |
| t1         | p2             |          0 |              0 |           0 |
| t2         | p0             |          1 |             20 |          20 |
| t2         | p1             |          0 |              0 |           0 |
| t2         | p2             |          0 |              0 |           0 |
| t2         | p3             |          0 |              0 |           0 |
+------------+----------------+------------+----------------+-------------+
7 rows in set (0.01 sec)
```

You can also demonstrate that these rows were stored in the
lowest-numbered partition of each table by dropping these
partitions, and then re-running the
[`SELECT`](select.md "15.2.13 SELECT Statement") statements:

```sql
mysql> ALTER TABLE t1 DROP PARTITION p0;
Query OK, 0 rows affected (0.16 sec)

mysql> ALTER TABLE t2 DROP PARTITION p0;
Query OK, 0 rows affected (0.16 sec)

mysql> SELECT * FROM t1;
Empty set (0.00 sec)

mysql> SELECT * FROM t2;
Empty set (0.00 sec)
```

(For more information on `ALTER TABLE ... DROP
PARTITION`, see [Section 15.1.9, “ALTER TABLE Statement”](alter-table.md "15.1.9 ALTER TABLE Statement").)

`NULL` is also treated in this way for
partitioning expressions that use SQL functions. Suppose that we
define a table using a [`CREATE
TABLE`](create-table.md "15.1.20 CREATE TABLE Statement") statement such as this one:

```sql
CREATE TABLE tndate (
    id INT,
    dt DATE
)
PARTITION BY RANGE( YEAR(dt) ) (
    PARTITION p0 VALUES LESS THAN (1990),
    PARTITION p1 VALUES LESS THAN (2000),
    PARTITION p2 VALUES LESS THAN MAXVALUE
);
```

As with other MySQL functions,
[`YEAR(NULL)`](date-and-time-functions.md#function_year) returns
`NULL`. A row with a `dt`
column value of `NULL` is treated as though the
partitioning expression evaluated to a value less than any other
value, and so is inserted into partition `p0`.

**Handling of NULL with LIST partitioning.**
A table that is partitioned by `LIST` admits
`NULL` values if and only if one of its
partitions is defined using that value-list that contains
`NULL`. The converse of this is that a table
partitioned by `LIST` which does not
explicitly use `NULL` in a value list rejects
rows resulting in a `NULL` value for the
partitioning expression, as shown in this example:

```sql
mysql> CREATE TABLE ts1 (
    ->     c1 INT,
    ->     c2 VARCHAR(20)
    -> )
    -> PARTITION BY LIST(c1) (
    ->     PARTITION p0 VALUES IN (0, 3, 6),
    ->     PARTITION p1 VALUES IN (1, 4, 7),
    ->     PARTITION p2 VALUES IN (2, 5, 8)
    -> );
Query OK, 0 rows affected (0.01 sec)

mysql> INSERT INTO ts1 VALUES (9, 'mothra');
ERROR 1504 (HY000): Table has no partition for value 9

mysql> INSERT INTO ts1 VALUES (NULL, 'mothra');
ERROR 1504 (HY000): Table has no partition for value NULL
```

Only rows having a `c1` value between
`0` and `8` inclusive can be
inserted into `ts1`. `NULL`
falls outside this range, just like the number
`9`. We can create tables
`ts2` and `ts3` having value
lists containing `NULL`, as shown here:

```sql
mysql> CREATE TABLE ts2 (
    ->     c1 INT,
    ->     c2 VARCHAR(20)
    -> )
    -> PARTITION BY LIST(c1) (
    ->     PARTITION p0 VALUES IN (0, 3, 6),
    ->     PARTITION p1 VALUES IN (1, 4, 7),
    ->     PARTITION p2 VALUES IN (2, 5, 8),
    ->     PARTITION p3 VALUES IN (NULL)
    -> );
Query OK, 0 rows affected (0.01 sec)

mysql> CREATE TABLE ts3 (
    ->     c1 INT,
    ->     c2 VARCHAR(20)
    -> )
    -> PARTITION BY LIST(c1) (
    ->     PARTITION p0 VALUES IN (0, 3, 6),
    ->     PARTITION p1 VALUES IN (1, 4, 7, NULL),
    ->     PARTITION p2 VALUES IN (2, 5, 8)
    -> );
Query OK, 0 rows affected (0.01 sec)
```

When defining value lists for partitioning, you can (and should)
treat `NULL` just as you would any other value.
For example, both `VALUES IN (NULL)` and
`VALUES IN (1, 4, 7, NULL)` are valid, as are
`VALUES IN (1, NULL, 4, 7)`, `VALUES IN
(NULL, 1, 4, 7)`, and so on. You can insert a row
having `NULL` for column `c1`
into each of the tables `ts2` and
`ts3`:

```sql
mysql> INSERT INTO ts2 VALUES (NULL, 'mothra');
Query OK, 1 row affected (0.00 sec)

mysql> INSERT INTO ts3 VALUES (NULL, 'mothra');
Query OK, 1 row affected (0.00 sec)
```

By issuing the appropriate query against
[`INFORMATION_SCHEMA.PARTITIONS`](information-schema-partitions-table.md "28.3.21 The INFORMATION_SCHEMA PARTITIONS Table"), you
can determine which partitions were used to store the rows just
inserted (we assume, as in the previous examples, that the
partitioned tables were created in the `p`
database):

```sql
mysql> SELECT TABLE_NAME, PARTITION_NAME, TABLE_ROWS, AVG_ROW_LENGTH, DATA_LENGTH
     >   FROM INFORMATION_SCHEMA.PARTITIONS
     >   WHERE TABLE_SCHEMA = 'p' AND TABLE_NAME LIKE 'ts_';
+------------+----------------+------------+----------------+-------------+
| TABLE_NAME | PARTITION_NAME | TABLE_ROWS | AVG_ROW_LENGTH | DATA_LENGTH |
+------------+----------------+------------+----------------+-------------+
| ts2        | p0             |          0 |              0 |           0 |
| ts2        | p1             |          0 |              0 |           0 |
| ts2        | p2             |          0 |              0 |           0 |
| ts2        | p3             |          1 |             20 |          20 |
| ts3        | p0             |          0 |              0 |           0 |
| ts3        | p1             |          1 |             20 |          20 |
| ts3        | p2             |          0 |              0 |           0 |
+------------+----------------+------------+----------------+-------------+
7 rows in set (0.01 sec)
```

As shown earlier in this section, you can also verify which
partitions were used for storing the rows by deleting these
partitions and then performing a
[`SELECT`](select.md "15.2.13 SELECT Statement").

**Handling of NULL with HASH and KEY partitioning.**
`NULL` is handled somewhat differently for
tables partitioned by `HASH` or
`KEY`. In these cases, any partition
expression that yields a `NULL` value is
treated as though its return value were zero. We can verify
this behavior by examining the effects on the file system of
creating a table partitioned by `HASH` and
populating it with a record containing appropriate values.
Suppose that you have a table `th` (also in
the `p` database) created using the following
statement:

```sql
mysql> CREATE TABLE th (
    ->     c1 INT,
    ->     c2 VARCHAR(20)
    -> )
    -> PARTITION BY HASH(c1)
    -> PARTITIONS 2;
Query OK, 0 rows affected (0.00 sec)
```

The partitions belonging to this table can be viewed using the
query shown here:

```sql
mysql> SELECT TABLE_NAME,PARTITION_NAME,TABLE_ROWS,AVG_ROW_LENGTH,DATA_LENGTH
     >   FROM INFORMATION_SCHEMA.PARTITIONS
     >   WHERE TABLE_SCHEMA = 'p' AND TABLE_NAME ='th';
+------------+----------------+------------+----------------+-------------+
| TABLE_NAME | PARTITION_NAME | TABLE_ROWS | AVG_ROW_LENGTH | DATA_LENGTH |
+------------+----------------+------------+----------------+-------------+
| th         | p0             |          0 |              0 |           0 |
| th         | p1             |          0 |              0 |           0 |
+------------+----------------+------------+----------------+-------------+
2 rows in set (0.00 sec)
```

`TABLE_ROWS` for each partition is 0. Now
insert two rows into `th` whose
`c1` column values are `NULL`
and 0, and verify that these rows were inserted, as shown here:

```sql
mysql> INSERT INTO th VALUES (NULL, 'mothra'), (0, 'gigan');
Query OK, 1 row affected (0.00 sec)

mysql> SELECT * FROM th;
+------+---------+
| c1   | c2      |
+------+---------+
| NULL | mothra  |
+------+---------+
|    0 | gigan   |
+------+---------+
2 rows in set (0.01 sec)
```

Recall that for any integer *`N`*, the
value of `NULL MOD
N` is always
`NULL`. For tables that are partitioned by
`HASH` or `KEY`, this result
is treated for determining the correct partition as
`0`. Checking the Information Schema
[`PARTITIONS`](information-schema-partitions-table.md "28.3.21 The INFORMATION_SCHEMA PARTITIONS Table") table once again, we can
see that both rows were inserted into partition
`p0`:

```sql
mysql> SELECT TABLE_NAME, PARTITION_NAME, TABLE_ROWS, AVG_ROW_LENGTH, DATA_LENGTH
     >   FROM INFORMATION_SCHEMA.PARTITIONS
     >   WHERE TABLE_SCHEMA = 'p' AND TABLE_NAME ='th';
+------------+----------------+------------+----------------+-------------+
| TABLE_NAME | PARTITION_NAME | TABLE_ROWS | AVG_ROW_LENGTH | DATA_LENGTH |
+------------+----------------+------------+----------------+-------------+
| th         | p0             |          2 |             20 |          20 |
| th         | p1             |          0 |              0 |           0 |
+------------+----------------+------------+----------------+-------------+
2 rows in set (0.00 sec)
```

By repeating the last example using `PARTITION BY
KEY` in place of `PARTITION BY HASH`
in the definition of the table, you can verify that
`NULL` is also treated like 0 for this type of
partitioning.
