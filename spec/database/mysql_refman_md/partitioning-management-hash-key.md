### 26.3.2 Management of HASH and KEY Partitions

Tables which are partitioned by hash or by key are very similar
to one another with regard to making changes in a partitioning
setup, and both differ in a number of ways from tables which
have been partitioned by range or list. For that reason, this
section addresses the modification of tables partitioned by hash
or by key only. For a discussion of adding and dropping of
partitions of tables that are partitioned by range or list, see
[Section 26.3.1, “Management of RANGE and LIST Partitions”](partitioning-management-range-list.md "26.3.1 Management of RANGE and LIST Partitions").

You cannot drop partitions from tables that are partitioned by
`HASH` or `KEY` in the same
way that you can from tables that are partitioned by
`RANGE` or `LIST`. However,
you can merge `HASH` or `KEY`
partitions using `ALTER TABLE ... COALESCE
PARTITION`. Suppose that a `clients`
table containing data about clients is divided into 12
partitions, created as shown here:

```sql
CREATE TABLE clients (
    id INT,
    fname VARCHAR(30),
    lname VARCHAR(30),
    signed DATE
)
PARTITION BY HASH( MONTH(signed) )
PARTITIONS 12;
```

To reduce the number of partitions from 12 to 8, execute the
following
[`ALTER
TABLE`](alter-table-partition-operations.md "15.1.9.1 ALTER TABLE Partition Operations") statement:

```sql
mysql> ALTER TABLE clients COALESCE PARTITION 4;
Query OK, 0 rows affected (0.02 sec)
```

`COALESCE` works equally well with tables that
are partitioned by `HASH`,
`KEY`, `LINEAR HASH`, or
`LINEAR KEY`. Here is an example similar to the
previous one, differing only in that the table is partitioned by
`LINEAR KEY`:

```sql
mysql> CREATE TABLE clients_lk (
    ->     id INT,
    ->     fname VARCHAR(30),
    ->     lname VARCHAR(30),
    ->     signed DATE
    -> )
    -> PARTITION BY LINEAR KEY(signed)
    -> PARTITIONS 12;
Query OK, 0 rows affected (0.03 sec)

mysql> ALTER TABLE clients_lk COALESCE PARTITION 4;
Query OK, 0 rows affected (0.06 sec)
Records: 0  Duplicates: 0  Warnings: 0
```

The number following `COALESCE PARTITION` is
the number of partitions to merge into the remainder—in
other words, it is the number of partitions to remove from the
table.

Attempting to remove more partitions than are in the table
results in an error like this one:

```sql
mysql> ALTER TABLE clients COALESCE PARTITION 18;
ERROR 1478 (HY000): Cannot remove all partitions, use DROP TABLE instead
```

To increase the number of partitions for the
`clients` table from 12 to 18, use
`ALTER TABLE ... ADD PARTITION` as shown here:

```sql
ALTER TABLE clients ADD PARTITION PARTITIONS 6;
```
