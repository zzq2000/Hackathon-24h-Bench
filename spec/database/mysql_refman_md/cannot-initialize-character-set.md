#### B.3.2.15 Can't initialize character set

You might see an error like this if you have character set
problems:

```none
MySQL Connection Failed: Can't initialize character set charset_name
```

This error can have any of the following causes:

- The character set is a multibyte character set and you
  have no support for the character set in the client. In
  this case, you need to recompile the client by running
  **CMake** with the
  [`-DDEFAULT_CHARSET=charset_name`](source-configuration-options.md#option_cmake_default_charset)
  option. See
  [Section 2.8.7, “MySQL Source-Configuration Options”](source-configuration-options.md "2.8.7 MySQL Source-Configuration Options").

  All standard MySQL binaries are compiled with support for
  all multibyte character sets.
- The character set is a simple character set that is not
  compiled into [**mysqld**](mysqld.md "6.3.1 mysqld — The MySQL Server"), and the character
  set definition files are not in the place where the client
  expects to find them.

  In this case, you need to use one of the following methods
  to solve the problem:

  - Recompile the client with support for the character
    set. See
    [Section 2.8.7, “MySQL Source-Configuration Options”](source-configuration-options.md "2.8.7 MySQL Source-Configuration Options").
  - Specify to the client the directory where the
    character set definition files are located. For many
    clients, you can do this with the
    `--character-sets-dir` option.
  - Copy the character definition files to the path where
    the client expects them to be.
