### 10.15.5 Tracing Memory Usage

Each stored trace is a string, which is extended (using
`realloc()`) as optimization progresses by
appending more data to it. The
[`optimizer_trace_max_mem_size`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_optimizer_trace_max_mem_size)
server system variable sets a limit on the total amount of memory
used by all traces currently being stored. If this limit is
reached, the current trace is not extended, which means the trace
is incomplete; in this case the
`MISSING_BYTES_BEYOND_MAX_MEM_SIZE` column shows
the number of bytes missing from the trace.
