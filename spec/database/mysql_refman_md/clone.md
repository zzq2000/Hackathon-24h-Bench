### 15.7.5 CLONE Statement

```sql
CLONE clone_action

clone_action: {
    LOCAL DATA DIRECTORY [=] 'clone_dir';
  | INSTANCE FROM 'user'@'host':port
    IDENTIFIED BY 'password'
    [DATA DIRECTORY [=] 'clone_dir']
    [REQUIRE [NO] SSL]
}
```

The [`CLONE`](clone.md "15.7.5 CLONE Statement") statement is used to
clone data locally or from a remote MySQL server instance. To use
[`CLONE`](clone.md "15.7.5 CLONE Statement") syntax, the clone plugin must
be installed. See [Section 7.6.7, “The Clone Plugin”](clone-plugin.md "7.6.7 The Clone Plugin").

[`CLONE LOCAL DATA
DIRECTORY`](clone.md "15.7.5 CLONE Statement") syntax clones data from the local MySQL data
directory to a directory on the same server or node where the
MySQL server instance runs. The `'clone_dir'`
directory is the full path of the local directory that data is
cloned to. An absolute path is required. The specified directory
must not exist, but the specified path must be an existent path.
The MySQL server requires the necessary write access to create the
specified directory. For more information, see
[Section 7.6.7.2, “Cloning Data Locally”](clone-plugin-local.md "7.6.7.2 Cloning Data Locally").

[`CLONE INSTANCE`](clone.md "15.7.5 CLONE Statement")
syntax clones data from a remote MySQL server instance (the donor)
and transfers it to the MySQL instance where the cloning operation
was initiated (the recipient).

- `user` is the
  clone user on the donor MySQL server instance.
- `host` is the
  [`hostname`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_hostname) address of the donor
  MySQL server instance. Internet Protocol version 6 (IPv6)
  address format is not supported. An alias to the IPv6 address
  can be used instead. An IPv4 address can be used as is.
- `port` is the
  [`port`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_port) number of the donor
  MySQL server instance. (The X Protocol port specified by
  [`mysqlx_port`](x-plugin-options-system-variables.md#sysvar_mysqlx_port) is not supported.
  Connecting to the donor MySQL server instance through MySQL Router
  is also not supported.)
- `IDENTIFIED BY
  'password'` specifies the
  password of the clone user on the donor MySQL server instance.
- `DATA DIRECTORY [=]
  'clone_dir'` is an
  optional clause used to specify a directory on the recipient
  for the data you are cloning. Use this option if you do not
  want to remove existing data in the recipient data directory.
  An absolute path is required, and the directory must not
  exist. The MySQL server must have the necessary write access
  to create the directory.

  When the optional `DATA DIRECTORY [=]
  'clone_dir'` clause is not
  used, a cloning operation removes existing data in the
  recipient data directory, replaces it with the cloned data,
  and automatically restarts the server afterward.
- `[REQUIRE [NO] SSL]` explicitly specifies
  whether an encrypted connection is to be used or not when
  transferring cloned data over the network. An error is
  returned if the explicit specification cannot be satisfied. If
  an SSL clause is not specified, clone attempts to establish an
  encrypted connection by default, falling back to an insecure
  connection if the secure connection attempt fails. A secure
  connection is required when cloning encrypted data regardless
  of whether this clause is specified. For more information, see
  [Configuring an Encrypted Connection for Cloning](clone-plugin-remote.md#clone-plugin-remote-ssl "Configuring an Encrypted Connection for Cloning").

For additional information about cloning data from a remote MySQL
server instance, see [Section 7.6.7.3, “Cloning Remote Data”](clone-plugin-remote.md "7.6.7.3 Cloning Remote Data").
