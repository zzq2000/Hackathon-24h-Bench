#### 25.6.16.12 The ndbinfo counters Table

The `counters` table provides running totals of
events such as reads and writes for specific kernel blocks and
data nodes. Counts are kept from the most recent node start or
restart; a node start or restart resets all counters on that
node. Not all kernel blocks have all types of counters.

The `counters` table contains the following
columns:

- `node_id`

  The data node ID
- `block_name`

  Name of the associated NDB kernel block (see
  [NDB Kernel Blocks](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/ndb-internals/en/ndb-internals-kernel-blocks.html)).
- `block_instance`

  Block instance
- `counter_id`

  The counter's internal ID number; normally an integer
  between 1 and 10, inclusive.
- `counter_name`

  The name of the counter. See text for names of individual
  counters and the NDB kernel block with which each counter is
  associated.
- `val`

  The counter's value

##### Notes

Each counter is associated with a particular NDB kernel block.

The `OPERATIONS` counter is associated with the
[`DBLQH`](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/ndb-internals/en/ndb-internals-kernel-blocks-dblqh.html) (local query handler)
kernel block. A primary-key read counts as one operation, as
does a primary-key update. For reads, there is one operation in
[`DBLQH`](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/ndb-internals/en/ndb-internals-kernel-blocks-dblqh.html) per operation in
[`DBTC`](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/ndb-internals/en/ndb-internals-kernel-blocks-dbtc.html). For writes, there is
one operation counted per fragment replica.

The `ATTRINFO`,
`TRANSACTIONS`, `COMMITS`,
`READS`, `LOCAL_READS`,
`SIMPLE_READS`, `WRITES`,
`LOCAL_WRITES`, `ABORTS`,
`TABLE_SCANS`, and
`RANGE_SCANS` counters are associated with the
[`DBTC`](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/ndb-internals/en/ndb-internals-kernel-blocks-dbtc.html) (transaction
co-ordinator) kernel block.

`LOCAL_WRITES` and
`LOCAL_READS` are primary-key operations using
a transaction coordinator in a node that also holds the primary
fragment replica of the record.

The `READS` counter includes all reads.
`LOCAL_READS` includes only those reads of the
primary fragment replica on the same node as this transaction
coordinator. `SIMPLE_READS` includes only those
reads in which the read operation is the beginning and ending
operation for a given transaction. Simple reads do not hold
locks but are part of a transaction, in that they observe
uncommitted changes made by the transaction containing them but
not of any other uncommitted transactions. Such reads are
“simple” from the point of view of the TC block;
since they hold no locks they are not durable, and once
[`DBTC`](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/ndb-internals/en/ndb-internals-kernel-blocks-dbtc.html) has routed them to the
relevant LQH block, it holds no state for them.

`ATTRINFO` keeps a count of the number of times
an interpreted program is sent to the data node. See
[NDB Protocol Messages](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/ndb-internals/en/ndb-internals-ndb-protocol-messages.html), for more
information about `ATTRINFO` messages in the
`NDB` kernel.

The `LOCAL_TABLE_SCANS_SENT`,
`READS_RECEIVED`,
`PRUNED_RANGE_SCANS_RECEIVED`,
`RANGE_SCANS_RECEIVED`,
`LOCAL_READS_SENT`,
`CONST_PRUNED_RANGE_SCANS_RECEIVED`,
`LOCAL_RANGE_SCANS_SENT`,
`REMOTE_READS_SENT`,
`REMOTE_RANGE_SCANS_SENT`,
`READS_NOT_FOUND`,
`SCAN_BATCHES_RETURNED`,
`TABLE_SCANS_RECEIVED`, and
`SCAN_ROWS_RETURNED` counters are associated
with the [`DBSPJ`](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/ndb-internals/en/ndb-internals-kernel-blocks-dbspj.html) (select
push-down join) kernel block.

The `block_name` and
`block_instance` columns provide, respectively,
the applicable NDB kernel block name and instance number. You
can use these to obtain information about specific threads from
the [`threadblocks`](mysql-cluster-ndbinfo-threadblocks.md "25.6.16.61 The ndbinfo threadblocks Table") table.

A number of counters provide information about transporter
overload and send buffer sizing when troubleshooting such
issues. For each LQH instance, there is one instance of each
counter in the following list:

- `LQHKEY_OVERLOAD`: Number of primary key
  requests rejected at the LQH block instance due to
  transporter overload
- `LQHKEY_OVERLOAD_TC`: Count of instances of
  `LQHKEY_OVERLOAD` where the TC node
  transporter was overloaded
- `LQHKEY_OVERLOAD_READER`: Count of
  instances of `LQHKEY_OVERLOAD` where the
  API reader (reads only) node was overloaded.
- `LQHKEY_OVERLOAD_NODE_PEER`: Count of
  instances of `LQHKEY_OVERLOAD` where the
  next backup data node (writes only) was overloaded
- `LQHKEY_OVERLOAD_SUBSCRIBER`: Count of
  instances of `LQHKEY_OVERLOAD` where a
  event subscriber (writes only) was overloaded.
- `LQHSCAN_SLOWDOWNS`: Count of instances
  where a fragment scan batch size was reduced due to scanning
  API transporter overload.
