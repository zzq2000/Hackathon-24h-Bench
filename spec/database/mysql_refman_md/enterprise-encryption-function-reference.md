### 8.6.4 MySQL Enterprise Encryption Function Reference

In releases from MySQL 8.0.30, MySQL Enterprise Encryption's functions are
provided by the MySQL component
`component_enterprise_encryption`. For their
descriptions, see
[Section 8.6.5, “MySQL Enterprise Encryption Component Function Descriptions”](enterprise-encryption-functions.md "8.6.5 MySQL Enterprise Encryption Component Function Descriptions").

In releases before MySQL 8.0.30, MySQL Enterprise Encryption's functions are based
on the `openssl_udf` shared library. The
functions continue to be available in later releases if they have
been installed, but they are deprecated. For their descriptions,
see [Section 8.6.6, “MySQL Enterprise Encryption Legacy Function Descriptions”](enterprise-encryption-functions-legacy.md "8.6.6 MySQL Enterprise Encryption Legacy Function Descriptions").

For information on upgrading to the new component functions
provided by the MySQL component
`component_enterprise_encryption`, and a list of
the behavior differences between the legacy functions and the
component functions, see
[Upgrading MySQL Enterprise Encryption](enterprise-encryption-installation.md#enterprise-encryption-upgrading "Upgrading MySQL Enterprise Encryption").
