### 14.4.4 Assignment Operators

**Table 14.6 Assignment Operators**

| Name | Description |
| --- | --- |
| [`:=`](assignment-operators.md#operator_assign-value) | Assign a value |
| [`=`](assignment-operators.md#operator_assign-equal) | Assign a value (as part of a [`SET`](set-variable.md "15.7.6.1 SET Syntax for Variable Assignment") statement, or as part of the `SET` clause in an [`UPDATE`](update.md "15.2.17 UPDATE Statement") statement) |

- [`:=`](assignment-operators.md#operator_assign-value)

  Assignment operator. Causes the user variable on the left
  hand side of the operator to take on the value to its right.
  The value on the right hand side may be a literal value,
  another variable storing a value, or any legal expression
  that yields a scalar value, including the result of a query
  (provided that this value is a scalar value). You can
  perform multiple assignments in the same
  [`SET`](set-variable.md "15.7.6.1 SET Syntax for Variable Assignment")
  statement. You can perform multiple assignments in the same
  statement.

  Unlike
  [`=`](assignment-operators.md#operator_assign-equal), the
  [`:=`](assignment-operators.md#operator_assign-value)
  operator is never interpreted as a comparison operator. This
  means you can use
  [`:=`](assignment-operators.md#operator_assign-value) in
  any valid SQL statement (not just in
  [`SET`](set-variable.md "15.7.6.1 SET Syntax for Variable Assignment")
  statements) to assign a value to a variable.

  ```sql
  mysql> SELECT @var1, @var2;
          -> NULL, NULL
  mysql> SELECT @var1 := 1, @var2;
          -> 1, NULL
  mysql> SELECT @var1, @var2;
          -> 1, NULL
  mysql> SELECT @var1, @var2 := @var1;
          -> 1, 1
  mysql> SELECT @var1, @var2;
          -> 1, 1

  mysql> SELECT @var1:=COUNT(*) FROM t1;
          -> 4
  mysql> SELECT @var1;
          -> 4
  ```

  You can make value assignments using
  [`:=`](assignment-operators.md#operator_assign-value) in
  other statements besides
  [`SELECT`](select.md "15.2.13 SELECT Statement"), such as
  [`UPDATE`](update.md "15.2.17 UPDATE Statement"), as shown here:

  ```sql
  mysql> SELECT @var1;
          -> 4
  mysql> SELECT * FROM t1;
          -> 1, 3, 5, 7

  mysql> UPDATE t1 SET c1 = 2 WHERE c1 = @var1:= 1;
  Query OK, 1 row affected (0.00 sec)
  Rows matched: 1  Changed: 1  Warnings: 0

  mysql> SELECT @var1;
          -> 1
  mysql> SELECT * FROM t1;
          -> 2, 3, 5, 7
  ```

  While it is also possible both to set and to read the value
  of the same variable in a single SQL statement using the
  [`:=`](assignment-operators.md#operator_assign-value)
  operator, this is not recommended.
  [Section 11.4, “User-Defined Variables”](user-variables.md "11.4 User-Defined Variables"), explains why you should
  avoid doing this.
- [`=`](assignment-operators.md#operator_assign-equal)

  This operator is used to perform value assignments in two
  cases, described in the next two paragraphs.

  Within a
  [`SET`](set-variable.md "15.7.6.1 SET Syntax for Variable Assignment")
  statement, `=` is treated as an assignment
  operator that causes the user variable on the left hand side
  of the operator to take on the value to its right. (In other
  words, when used in a
  [`SET`](set-variable.md "15.7.6.1 SET Syntax for Variable Assignment")
  statement, `=` is treated identically to
  [`:=`](assignment-operators.md#operator_assign-value).)
  The value on the right hand side may be a literal value,
  another variable storing a value, or any legal expression
  that yields a scalar value, including the result of a query
  (provided that this value is a scalar value). You can
  perform multiple assignments in the same
  [`SET`](set-variable.md "15.7.6.1 SET Syntax for Variable Assignment")
  statement.

  In the `SET` clause of an
  [`UPDATE`](update.md "15.2.17 UPDATE Statement") statement,
  `=` also acts as an assignment operator; in
  this case, however, it causes the column named on the left
  hand side of the operator to assume the value given to the
  right, provided any `WHERE` conditions that
  are part of the [`UPDATE`](update.md "15.2.17 UPDATE Statement") are
  met. You can make multiple assignments in the same
  `SET` clause of an
  [`UPDATE`](update.md "15.2.17 UPDATE Statement") statement.

  In any other context, `=` is treated as a
  [comparison operator](comparison-operators.md#operator_equal).

  ```sql
  mysql> SELECT @var1, @var2;
          -> NULL, NULL
  mysql> SELECT @var1 := 1, @var2;
          -> 1, NULL
  mysql> SELECT @var1, @var2;
          -> 1, NULL
  mysql> SELECT @var1, @var2 := @var1;
          -> 1, 1
  mysql> SELECT @var1, @var2;
          -> 1, 1
  ```
