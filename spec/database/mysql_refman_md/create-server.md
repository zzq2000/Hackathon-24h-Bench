### 15.1.18 CREATE SERVER Statement

```sql
CREATE SERVER server_name
    FOREIGN DATA WRAPPER wrapper_name
    OPTIONS (option [, option] ...)

option: {
    HOST character-literal
  | DATABASE character-literal
  | USER character-literal
  | PASSWORD character-literal
  | SOCKET character-literal
  | OWNER character-literal
  | PORT numeric-literal
}
```

This statement creates the definition of a server for use with the
`FEDERATED` storage engine. The `CREATE
SERVER` statement creates a new row in the
`servers` table in the `mysql`
database. This statement requires the
[`SUPER`](privileges-provided.md#priv_super) privilege.

The `server_name`
should be a unique reference to the server. Server definitions are
global within the scope of the server, it is not possible to
qualify the server definition to a specific database.
`server_name` has a
maximum length of 64 characters (names longer than 64 characters
are silently truncated), and is case-insensitive. You may specify
the name as a quoted string.

The `wrapper_name` is
an identifier and may be quoted with single quotation marks.

For each `option` you
must specify either a character literal or numeric literal.
Character literals are UTF-8, support a maximum length of 64
characters and default to a blank (empty) string. String literals
are silently truncated to 64 characters. Numeric literals must be
a number between 0 and 9999, default value is 0.

Note

The `OWNER` option is currently not applied,
and has no effect on the ownership or operation of the server
connection that is created.

The `CREATE SERVER` statement creates an entry in
the `mysql.servers` table that can later be used
with the [`CREATE TABLE`](create-table.md "15.1.20 CREATE TABLE Statement") statement
when creating a `FEDERATED` table. The options
that you specify are used to populate the columns in the
`mysql.servers` table. The table columns are
`Server_name`, `Host`,
`Db`, `Username`,
`Password`, `Port` and
`Socket`.

For example:

```sql
CREATE SERVER s
FOREIGN DATA WRAPPER mysql
OPTIONS (USER 'Remote', HOST '198.51.100.106', DATABASE 'test');
```

Be sure to specify all options necessary to establish a connection
to the server. The user name, host name, and database name are
mandatory. Other options might be required as well, such as
password.

The data stored in the table can be used when creating a
connection to a `FEDERATED` table:

```sql
CREATE TABLE t (s1 INT) ENGINE=FEDERATED CONNECTION='s';
```

For more information, see
[Section 18.8, “The FEDERATED Storage Engine”](federated-storage-engine.md "18.8 The FEDERATED Storage Engine").

`CREATE SERVER` causes an implicit commit. See
[Section 15.3.3, “Statements That Cause an Implicit Commit”](implicit-commit.md "15.3.3 Statements That Cause an Implicit Commit").

`CREATE SERVER` is not written to the binary log,
regardless of the logging format that is in use.
