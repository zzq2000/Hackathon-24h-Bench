### 9.3.2 Using Backups for Recovery

Now, suppose that we have a catastrophic unexpected exit on
Wednesday at 8 a.m. that requires recovery from backups. To
recover, first we restore the last full backup we have (the one
from Sunday 1 p.m.). The full backup file is just a set of SQL
statements, so restoring it is very easy:

```terminal
$> mysql < backup_sunday_1_PM.sql
```

At this point, the data is restored to its state as of Sunday 1
p.m.. To restore the changes made since then, we must use the
incremental backups; that is, the
`gbichot2-bin.000007` and
`gbichot2-bin.000008` binary log files. Fetch
the files if necessary from where they were backed up, and then
process their contents like this:

```terminal
$> mysqlbinlog gbichot2-bin.000007 gbichot2-bin.000008 | mysql
```

We now have recovered the data to its state as of Tuesday 1
p.m., but still are missing the changes from that date to the
date of the crash. To not lose them, we would have needed to
have the MySQL server store its MySQL binary logs into a safe
location (RAID disks, SAN, ...) different from the place where
it stores its data files, so that these logs were not on the
destroyed disk. (That is, we can start the server with a
[`--log-bin`](replication-options-binary-log.md#option_mysqld_log-bin) option that specifies a
location on a different physical device from the one on which
the data directory resides. That way, the logs are safe even if
the device containing the directory is lost.) If we had done
this, we would have the `gbichot2-bin.000009`
file (and any subsequent files) at hand, and we could apply them
using [**mysqlbinlog**](mysqlbinlog.md "6.6.9 mysqlbinlog — Utility for Processing Binary Log Files") and
[**mysql**](mysql.md "6.5.1 mysql — The MySQL Command-Line Client") to restore the most recent data changes
with no loss up to the moment of the crash:

```terminal
$> mysqlbinlog gbichot2-bin.000009 ... | mysql
```
