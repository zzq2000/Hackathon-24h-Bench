#### 1.6.2.3 FOREIGN KEY Constraint Differences

The MySQL implementation of foreign key constraints differs
from the SQL standard in the following key respects:

- If there are several rows in the parent table with the
  same referenced key value,
  [`InnoDB`](innodb-storage-engine.md "Chapter 17 The InnoDB Storage Engine") performs a foreign key
  check as if the other parent rows with the same key value
  do not exist. For example, if you define a
  `RESTRICT` type constraint, and there is
  a child row with several parent rows,
  `InnoDB` does not permit the deletion of
  any of the parent rows.
- If `ON UPDATE CASCADE` or `ON
  UPDATE SET NULL` recurses to update the
  *same table* it has previously updated
  during the same cascade, it acts like
  `RESTRICT`. This means that you cannot
  use self-referential `ON UPDATE CASCADE`
  or `ON UPDATE SET NULL` operations. This
  is to prevent infinite loops resulting from cascaded
  updates. A self-referential `ON DELETE SET
  NULL`, on the other hand, is possible, as is a
  self-referential `ON DELETE CASCADE`.
  Cascading operations may not be nested more than 15 levels
  deep.
- In an SQL statement that inserts, deletes, or updates many
  rows, foreign key constraints (like unique constraints)
  are checked row-by-row. When performing foreign key
  checks, [`InnoDB`](innodb-storage-engine.md "Chapter 17 The InnoDB Storage Engine") sets shared
  row-level locks on child or parent records that it must
  examine. MySQL checks foreign key constraints immediately;
  the check is not deferred to transaction commit. According
  to the SQL standard, the default behavior should be
  deferred checking. That is, constraints are only checked
  after the *entire SQL statement* has
  been processed. This means that it is not possible to
  delete a row that refers to itself using a foreign key.
- No storage engine, including `InnoDB`,
  recognizes or enforces the `MATCH` clause
  used in referential-integrity constraint definitions. Use
  of an explicit `MATCH` clause does not
  have the specified effect, and it causes `ON
  DELETE` and `ON UPDATE` clauses
  to be ignored. Specifying the `MATCH`
  should be avoided.

  The `MATCH` clause in the SQL standard
  controls how `NULL` values in a composite
  (multiple-column) foreign key are handled when comparing
  to a primary key in the referenced table. MySQL
  essentially implements the semantics defined by
  `MATCH SIMPLE`, which permits a foreign
  key to be all or partially `NULL`. In
  that case, a (child table) row containing such a foreign
  key can be inserted even though it does not match any row
  in the referenced (parent) table. (It is possible to
  implement other semantics using triggers.)
- MySQL requires that the referenced columns be indexed for
  performance reasons. However, MySQL does not enforce a
  requirement that the referenced columns be
  `UNIQUE` or be declared `NOT
  NULL`.

  A `FOREIGN KEY` constraint that
  references a non-`UNIQUE` key is not
  standard SQL but rather an
  [`InnoDB`](innodb-storage-engine.md "Chapter 17 The InnoDB Storage Engine") extension. The
  [`NDB`](mysql-cluster.md "Chapter 25 MySQL NDB Cluster 8.0") storage engine, on the
  other hand, requires an explicit unique key (or primary
  key) on any column referenced as a foreign key.

  The handling of foreign key references to nonunique keys
  or keys that contain `NULL` values is not
  well defined for operations such as
  [`UPDATE`](update.md "15.2.17 UPDATE Statement") or `DELETE
  CASCADE`. You are advised to use foreign keys
  that reference only `UNIQUE` (including
  `PRIMARY`) and `NOT
  NULL` keys.
- For storage engines that do not support foreign keys (such
  as [`MyISAM`](myisam-storage-engine.md "18.2 The MyISAM Storage Engine")), MySQL Server
  parses and ignores foreign key specifications.
- MySQL parses but ignores “inline
  `REFERENCES` specifications” (as
  defined in the SQL standard) where the references are
  defined as part of the column specification. MySQL accepts
  `REFERENCES` clauses only when specified
  as part of a separate `FOREIGN KEY`
  specification.

  Defining a column to use a `REFERENCES
  tbl_name(col_name)`
  clause has no actual effect and *serves only as a
  memo or comment to you that the column which you are
  currently defining is intended to refer to a column in
  another table*. It is important to realize when
  using this syntax that:

  - MySQL does not perform any sort of check to make sure
    that *`col_name`* actually
    exists in *`tbl_name`* (or even
    that *`tbl_name`* itself
    exists).
  - MySQL does not perform any sort of action on
    *`tbl_name`* such as deleting
    rows in response to actions taken on rows in the table
    which you are defining; in other words, this syntax
    induces no `ON DELETE` or `ON
    UPDATE` behavior whatsoever. (Although you
    can write an `ON DELETE` or
    `ON UPDATE` clause as part of the
    `REFERENCES` clause, it is also
    ignored.)
  - This syntax creates a *column*; it
    does **not** create any
    sort of index or key.

  You can use a column so created as a join column, as shown
  here:

  ```sql
  CREATE TABLE person (
      id SMALLINT UNSIGNED NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT,
      name CHAR(60) NOT NULL,
      PRIMARY KEY (id)
  );

  CREATE TABLE shirt (
      id SMALLINT UNSIGNED NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT,
      style ENUM('t-shirt', 'polo', 'dress') NOT NULL,
      color ENUM('red', 'blue', 'orange', 'white', 'black') NOT NULL,
      owner SMALLINT UNSIGNED NOT NULL REFERENCES person(id),
      PRIMARY KEY (id)
  );

  INSERT INTO person VALUES (NULL, 'Antonio Paz');

  SELECT @last := LAST_INSERT_ID();

  INSERT INTO shirt VALUES
  (NULL, 'polo', 'blue', @last),
  (NULL, 'dress', 'white', @last),
  (NULL, 't-shirt', 'blue', @last);

  INSERT INTO person VALUES (NULL, 'Lilliana Angelovska');

  SELECT @last := LAST_INSERT_ID();

  INSERT INTO shirt VALUES
  (NULL, 'dress', 'orange', @last),
  (NULL, 'polo', 'red', @last),
  (NULL, 'dress', 'blue', @last),
  (NULL, 't-shirt', 'white', @last);

  SELECT * FROM person;
  +----+---------------------+
  | id | name                |
  +----+---------------------+
  |  1 | Antonio Paz         |
  |  2 | Lilliana Angelovska |
  +----+---------------------+

  SELECT * FROM shirt;
  +----+---------+--------+-------+
  | id | style   | color  | owner |
  +----+---------+--------+-------+
  |  1 | polo    | blue   |     1 |
  |  2 | dress   | white  |     1 |
  |  3 | t-shirt | blue   |     1 |
  |  4 | dress   | orange |     2 |
  |  5 | polo    | red    |     2 |
  |  6 | dress   | blue   |     2 |
  |  7 | t-shirt | white  |     2 |
  +----+---------+--------+-------+

  SELECT s.* FROM person p INNER JOIN shirt s
     ON s.owner = p.id
   WHERE p.name LIKE 'Lilliana%'
     AND s.color <> 'white';

  +----+-------+--------+-------+
  | id | style | color  | owner |
  +----+-------+--------+-------+
  |  4 | dress | orange |     2 |
  |  5 | polo  | red    |     2 |
  |  6 | dress | blue   |     2 |
  +----+-------+--------+-------+
  ```

  When used in this fashion, the
  `REFERENCES` clause is not displayed in
  the output of [`SHOW CREATE
  TABLE`](show-create-table.md "15.7.7.10 SHOW CREATE TABLE Statement") or
  [`DESCRIBE`](describe.md "15.8.1 DESCRIBE Statement"):

  ```sql
  SHOW CREATE TABLE shirt\G
  *************************** 1. row ***************************
  Table: shirt
  Create Table: CREATE TABLE `shirt` (
  `id` smallint(5) unsigned NOT NULL auto_increment,
  `style` enum('t-shirt','polo','dress') NOT NULL,
  `color` enum('red','blue','orange','white','black') NOT NULL,
  `owner` smallint(5) unsigned NOT NULL,
  PRIMARY KEY  (`id`)
  ) ENGINE=InnoDB DEFAULT CHARSET=utf8mb4 COLLATE=utf8mb4_0900_ai_ci
  ```
