#### 18.2.3.3 Compressed Table Characteristics

Compressed storage format is a read-only format that is
generated with the [**myisampack**](myisampack.md "6.6.6 myisampack — Generate Compressed, Read-Only MyISAM Tables") tool.
Compressed tables can be uncompressed with
[**myisamchk**](myisamchk.md "6.6.4 myisamchk — MyISAM Table-Maintenance Utility").

Compressed tables have the following characteristics:

- Compressed tables take very little disk space. This
  minimizes disk usage, which is helpful when using slow disks
  (such as CD-ROMs).
- Each row is compressed separately, so there is very little
  access overhead. The header for a row takes up one to three
  bytes depending on the biggest row in the table. Each column
  is compressed differently. There is usually a different
  Huffman tree for each column. Some of the compression types
  are:

  - Suffix space compression.
  - Prefix space compression.
  - Numbers with a value of zero are stored using one bit.
  - If values in an integer column have a small range, the
    column is stored using the smallest possible type. For
    example, a [`BIGINT`](integer-types.md "13.1.2 Integer Types (Exact Value) - INTEGER, INT, SMALLINT, TINYINT, MEDIUMINT, BIGINT") column
    (eight bytes) can be stored as a
    [`TINYINT`](integer-types.md "13.1.2 Integer Types (Exact Value) - INTEGER, INT, SMALLINT, TINYINT, MEDIUMINT, BIGINT") column (one byte)
    if all its values are in the range from
    `-128` to `127`.
  - If a column has only a small set of possible values, the
    data type is converted to
    [`ENUM`](enum.md "13.3.5 The ENUM Type").
  - A column may use any combination of the preceding
    compression types.
- Can be used for fixed-length or dynamic-length rows.

Note

While a compressed table is read only, and you cannot
therefore update or add rows in the table, DDL (Data
Definition Language) operations are still valid. For example,
you may still use `DROP` to drop the table,
and [`TRUNCATE TABLE`](truncate-table.md "15.1.37 TRUNCATE TABLE Statement") to empty the
table.
