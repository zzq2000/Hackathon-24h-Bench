### 13.4.3 Supported Spatial Data Formats

Two standard spatial data formats are used to represent geometry
objects in queries:

- Well-Known Text (WKT) format
- Well-Known Binary (WKB) format

Internally, MySQL stores geometry values in a format that is not
identical to either WKT or WKB format. (Internal format is like
WKB but with an initial 4 bytes to indicate the SRID.)

There are functions available to convert between different data
formats; see [Section 14.16.6, “Geometry Format Conversion Functions”](gis-format-conversion-functions.md "14.16.6 Geometry Format Conversion Functions").

The following sections describe the spatial data formats MySQL
uses:

- [Well-Known Text (WKT) Format](gis-data-formats.md#gis-wkt-format "Well-Known Text (WKT) Format")
- [Well-Known Binary (WKB) Format](gis-data-formats.md#gis-wkb-format "Well-Known Binary (WKB) Format")
- [Internal Geometry Storage Format](gis-data-formats.md#gis-internal-format "Internal Geometry Storage Format")

#### Well-Known Text (WKT) Format

The Well-Known Text (WKT) representation of geometry values is
designed for exchanging geometry data in ASCII form. The
OpenGIS specification provides a Backus-Naur grammar that
specifies the formal production rules for writing WKT values
(see [Section 13.4, “Spatial Data Types”](spatial-types.md "13.4 Spatial Data Types")).

Examples of WKT representations of geometry objects:

- A `Point`:

  ```simple
  POINT(15 20)
  ```

  The point coordinates are specified with no separating
  comma. This differs from the syntax for the SQL
  [`Point()`](gis-mysql-specific-functions.md#function_point) function, which
  requires a comma between the coordinates. Take care to use
  the syntax appropriate to the context of a given spatial
  operation. For example, the following statements both use
  [`ST_X()`](gis-point-property-functions.md#function_st-x) to extract the
  X-coordinate from a `Point` object. The
  first produces the object directly using the
  [`Point()`](gis-mysql-specific-functions.md#function_point) function. The
  second uses a WKT representation converted to a
  `Point` with
  [`ST_GeomFromText()`](gis-wkt-functions.md#function_st-geomfromtext).

  ```sql
  mysql> SELECT ST_X(Point(15, 20));
  +---------------------+
  | ST_X(POINT(15, 20)) |
  +---------------------+
  |                  15 |
  +---------------------+

  mysql> SELECT ST_X(ST_GeomFromText('POINT(15 20)'));
  +---------------------------------------+
  | ST_X(ST_GeomFromText('POINT(15 20)')) |
  +---------------------------------------+
  |                                    15 |
  +---------------------------------------+
  ```
- A `LineString` with four points:

  ```simple
  LINESTRING(0 0, 10 10, 20 25, 50 60)
  ```

  The point coordinate pairs are separated by commas.
- A `Polygon` with one exterior ring and
  one interior ring:

  ```simple
  POLYGON((0 0,10 0,10 10,0 10,0 0),(5 5,7 5,7 7,5 7, 5 5))
  ```
- A `MultiPoint` with three
  `Point` values:

  ```simple
  MULTIPOINT(0 0, 20 20, 60 60)
  ```

  Spatial functions such as
  [`ST_MPointFromText()`](gis-wkt-functions.md#function_st-mpointfromtext) and
  [`ST_GeomFromText()`](gis-wkt-functions.md#function_st-geomfromtext) that
  accept WKT-format representations of
  `MultiPoint` values permit individual
  points within values to be surrounded by parentheses. For
  example, both of the following function calls are valid:

  ```sql
  ST_MPointFromText('MULTIPOINT (1 1, 2 2, 3 3)')
  ST_MPointFromText('MULTIPOINT ((1 1), (2 2), (3 3))')
  ```
- A `MultiLineString` with two
  `LineString` values:

  ```simple
  MULTILINESTRING((10 10, 20 20), (15 15, 30 15))
  ```
- A `MultiPolygon` with two
  `Polygon` values:

  ```simple
  MULTIPOLYGON(((0 0,10 0,10 10,0 10,0 0)),((5 5,7 5,7 7,5 7, 5 5)))
  ```
- A `GeometryCollection` consisting of two
  `Point` values and one
  `LineString`:

  ```simple
  GEOMETRYCOLLECTION(POINT(10 10), POINT(30 30), LINESTRING(15 15, 20 20))
  ```

#### Well-Known Binary (WKB) Format

The Well-Known Binary (WKB) representation of geometric values
is used for exchanging geometry data as binary streams
represented by [`BLOB`](blob.md "13.3.4 The BLOB and TEXT Types") values
containing geometric WKB information. This format is defined
by the OpenGIS specification (see
[Section 13.4, “Spatial Data Types”](spatial-types.md "13.4 Spatial Data Types")). It is also defined in the
ISO *SQL/MM Part 3: Spatial* standard.

WKB uses 1-byte unsigned integers, 4-byte unsigned integers,
and 8-byte double-precision numbers (IEEE 754 format). A byte
is eight bits.

For example, a WKB value that corresponds to `POINT(1
-1)` consists of this sequence of 21 bytes, each
represented by two hexadecimal digits:

```simple
0101000000000000000000F03F000000000000F0BF
```

The sequence consists of the components shown in the following
table.

**Table 13.2 WKB Components Example**

| Component | Size | Value |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Byte order | 1 byte | `01` |
| WKB type | 4 bytes | `01000000` |
| X coordinate | 8 bytes | `000000000000F03F` |
| Y coordinate | 8 bytes | `000000000000F0BF` |

Component representation is as follows:

- The byte order indicator is either 1 or 0 to signify
  little-endian or big-endian storage. The little-endian and
  big-endian byte orders are also known as Network Data
  Representation (NDR) and External Data Representation
  (XDR), respectively.
- The WKB type is a code that indicates the geometry type.
  MySQL uses values from 1 through 7 to indicate
  `Point`, `LineString`,
  `Polygon`, `MultiPoint`,
  `MultiLineString`,
  `MultiPolygon`, and
  `GeometryCollection`.
- A `Point` value has X and Y coordinates,
  each represented as a double-precision value.

WKB values for more complex geometry values have more complex
data structures, as detailed in the OpenGIS specification.

#### Internal Geometry Storage Format

MySQL stores geometry values using 4 bytes to indicate the
SRID followed by the WKB representation of the value. For a
description of WKB format, see
[Well-Known Binary (WKB) Format](gis-data-formats.md#gis-wkb-format "Well-Known Binary (WKB) Format").

For the WKB part, these MySQL-specific considerations apply:

- The byte-order indicator byte is 1 because MySQL stores
  geometries as little-endian values.
- MySQL supports geometry types of `Point`,
  `LineString`, `Polygon`,
  `MultiPoint`,
  `MultiLineString`,
  `MultiPolygon`, and
  `GeometryCollection`. Other geometry
  types are not supported.
- Only `GeometryCollection` can be empty.
  Such a value is stored with 0 elements.
- Polygon rings can be specified both clockwise and
  counterclockwise. MySQL flips the rings automatically when
  reading data.

Cartesian coordinates are stored in the length unit of the
spatial reference system, with X values in the X coordinates
and Y values in the Y coordinates. Axis directions are those
specified by the spatial reference system.

Geographic coordinates are stored in the angle unit of the
spatial reference system, with longitudes in the X coordinates
and latitudes in the Y coordinates. Axis directions and the
meridian are those specified by the spatial reference system.

The [`LENGTH()`](string-functions.md#function_length) function returns
the space in bytes required for value storage. Example:

```sql
mysql> SET @g = ST_GeomFromText('POINT(1 -1)');
mysql> SELECT LENGTH(@g);
+------------+
| LENGTH(@g) |
+------------+
|         25 |
+------------+
mysql> SELECT HEX(@g);
+----------------------------------------------------+
| HEX(@g)                                            |
+----------------------------------------------------+
| 000000000101000000000000000000F03F000000000000F0BF |
+----------------------------------------------------+
```

The value length is 25 bytes, made up of these components (as
can be seen from the hexadecimal value):

- 4 bytes for integer SRID (0)
- 1 byte for integer byte order (1 = little-endian)
- 4 bytes for integer type information (1 =
  `Point`)
- 8 bytes for double-precision X coordinate (1)
- 8 bytes for double-precision Y coordinate (−1)
