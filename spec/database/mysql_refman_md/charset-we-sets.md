### 12.10.2 West European Character Sets

Western European character sets cover most West European
languages, such as French, Spanish, Catalan, Basque, Portuguese,
Italian, Albanian, Dutch, German, Danish, Swedish, Norwegian,
Finnish, Faroese, Icelandic, Irish, Scottish, and English.

- `ascii` (US ASCII) collations:

  - `ascii_bin`
  - `ascii_general_ci` (default)
- `cp850` (DOS West European) collations:

  - `cp850_bin`
  - `cp850_general_ci` (default)
- `dec8` (DEC Western European) collations:

  - `dec8_bin`
  - `dec8_swedish_ci` (default)

  The `dec` character set is deprecated in
  MySQL 8.0.28; expect support for it to be removed in a
  subsequent MySQL release.
- `hp8` (HP Western European) collations:

  - `hp8_bin`
  - `hp8_english_ci` (default)

  The `hp8` character set is deprecated in
  MySQL 8.0.28; expect support for it to be removed in a
  subsequent MySQL release.
- `latin1` (cp1252 West European) collations:

  - `latin1_bin`
  - `latin1_danish_ci`
  - `latin1_general_ci`
  - `latin1_general_cs`
  - `latin1_german1_ci`
  - `latin1_german2_ci`
  - `latin1_spanish_ci`
  - `latin1_swedish_ci` (default)

  MySQL's `latin1` is the same as the Windows
  `cp1252` character set. This means it is
  the same as the official `ISO 8859-1` or
  IANA (Internet Assigned Numbers Authority)
  `latin1`, except that IANA
  `latin1` treats the code points between
  `0x80` and `0x9f` as
  “undefined,” whereas `cp1252`,
  and therefore MySQL's `latin1`, assign
  characters for those positions. For example,
  `0x80` is the Euro sign. For the
  “undefined” entries in
  `cp1252`, MySQL translates
  `0x81` to Unicode
  `0x0081`, `0x8d` to
  `0x008d`, `0x8f` to
  `0x008f`, `0x90` to
  `0x0090`, and `0x9d` to
  `0x009d`.

  The `latin1_swedish_ci` collation is the
  default that probably is used by the majority of MySQL
  customers. Although it is frequently said that it is based
  on the Swedish/Finnish collation rules, there are Swedes and
  Finns who disagree with this statement.

  The `latin1_german1_ci` and
  `latin1_german2_ci` collations are based on
  the DIN-1 and DIN-2 standards, where DIN stands for
  *Deutsches Institut für
  Normung* (the German equivalent of ANSI).
  DIN-1 is called the “dictionary collation” and
  DIN-2 is called the “phone book collation.” For
  an example of the effect this has in comparisons or when
  doing searches, see
  [Section 12.8.6, “Examples of the Effect of Collation”](charset-collation-effect.md "12.8.6 Examples of the Effect of Collation").

  - `latin1_german1_ci` (dictionary) rules:

    ```none
    Ä = A
    Ö = O
    Ü = U
    ß = s
    ```
  - `latin1_german2_ci` (phone-book) rules:

    ```none
    Ä = AE
    Ö = OE
    Ü = UE
    ß = ss
    ```

  In the `latin1_spanish_ci` collation,
  `ñ` (n-tilde) is a separate letter between
  `n` and `o`.
- `macroman` (Mac West European) collations:

  - `macroman_bin`
  - `macroman_general_ci` (default)

  `macroroman` is deprecated in MySQL 8.0.28;
  expect support for it to be removed in a subsequent MySQL
  release.
- `swe7` (7bit Swedish) collations:

  - `swe7_bin`
  - `swe7_swedish_ci` (default)
