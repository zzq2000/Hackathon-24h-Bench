### 20.2.2 Deploying Group Replication Locally

The most common way to deploy Group Replication is using multiple
server instances, to provide high availability. It is also
possible to deploy Group Replication locally, for example for
testing purposes. This section explains how you can deploy Group
Replication locally.

Important

Group Replication is usually deployed on multiple hosts because
this ensures that high-availability is provided. The
instructions in this section are not suitable for production
deployments because all MySQL server instances are running on
the same single host. In the event of failure of this host, the
whole group fails. Therefore this information should be used for
testing purposes and it should not be used in a production
environments.

This section explains how to create a replication group with three
MySQL Server instances on one physical machine. This means that
three data directories are needed, one per server instance, and
that you need to configure each instance independently. This -
procedure assumes that MySQL Server was downloaded and unpacked -
into the directory named
`mysql-8.0`. Each MySQL server
instance requires a specific data directory. Create a directory
named `data`, then in that directory create a
subdirectory for each server instance, for example s1, s2 and s3,
and initialize each one.

```terminal
mysql-8.0/bin/mysqld --initialize-insecure --basedir=$PWD/mysql-8.0 --datadir=$PWD/data/s1
mysql-8.0/bin/mysqld --initialize-insecure --basedir=$PWD/mysql-8.0 --datadir=$PWD/data/s2
mysql-8.0/bin/mysqld --initialize-insecure --basedir=$PWD/mysql-8.0 --datadir=$PWD/data/s3
```

Inside `data/s1`, `data/s2`,
`data/s3` is an initialized data directory,
containing the mysql system database and related tables and much
more. To learn more about the initialization procedure, see
[Section 2.9.1, “Initializing the Data Directory”](data-directory-initialization.md "2.9.1 Initializing the Data Directory").

Warning

Do not use `-initialize-insecure` in production
environments, it is only used here to simplify the tutorial. For
more information on security settings, see
[Section 20.6, “Group Replication Security”](group-replication-security.md "20.6 Group Replication Security").

#### Configuration of Local Group Replication Members

When you are following
[Section 20.2.1.2, “Configuring an Instance for Group Replication”](group-replication-configuring-instances.md "20.2.1.2 Configuring an Instance for Group Replication"), you
need to add configuration for the data directories added in the
previous section. For example:

```ini
[mysqld]

# server configuration
datadir=<full_path_to_data>/data/s1
basedir=<full_path_to_bin>/mysql-8.0/

port=24801
socket=<full_path_to_sock_dir>/s1.sock
```

These settings configure MySQL server to use the data directory
created earlier and which port the server should open and start
listening for incoming connections.

Note

The non-default port of 24801 is used because in this tutorial
the three server instances use the same hostname. In a setup
with three different machines this would not be required.

Group Replication requires a network connection between the
members, which means that each member must be able to resolve
the network address of all of the other members. For example in
this tutorial all three instances run on one machine, so to
ensure that the members can contact each other you could add a
line to the option file such as
[`report_host=127.0.0.1`](replication-options-replica.md#sysvar_report_host).

Then each member needs to be able to connect to the other
members on their
[`group_replication_local_address`](group-replication-system-variables.md#sysvar_group_replication_local_address).
For example in the option file of member s1 add:

```ini
group_replication_local_address= "127.0.0.1:24901"
group_replication_group_seeds= "127.0.0.1:24901,127.0.0.1:24902,127.0.0.1:24903"
```

This configures s1 to use port 24901 for internal group
communication with seed members. For each server instance you
want to add to the group, make these changes in the option file
of the member. For each member you must ensure a unique address
is specified, so use a unique port per instance for
[`group_replication_local_address`](group-replication-system-variables.md#sysvar_group_replication_local_address).
Usually you want all members to be able to serve as seeds for
members that are joining the group and have not got the
transactions processed by the group. In this case, add all of
the ports to
[`group_replication_group_seeds`](group-replication-system-variables.md#sysvar_group_replication_group_seeds)
as shown above.

The remaining steps of
[Section 20.2.1, “Deploying Group Replication in Single-Primary Mode”](group-replication-deploying-in-single-primary-mode.md "20.2.1 Deploying Group Replication in Single-Primary Mode")
apply equally to a group which you have deployed locally in this
way.
