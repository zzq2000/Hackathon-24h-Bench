#### 25.6.16.42 The ndbinfo logbuffers Table

The `logbuffer` table provides information on
NDB Cluster log buffer usage.

The `logbuffers` table contains the following
columns:

- `node_id`

  The ID of this data node.
- `log_type`

  Type of log. One of: `REDO`,
  `DD-UNDO`, `BACKUP-DATA`,
  or `BACKUP-LOG`.
- `log_id`

  The log ID; for Disk Data undo log files, this is the same
  as the value shown in the
  `LOGFILE_GROUP_NUMBER` column of the
  Information Schema [`FILES`](information-schema-files-table.md "28.3.15 The INFORMATION_SCHEMA FILES Table") table
  as well as the value shown for the `log_id`
  column of the `ndbinfo`
  [`logspaces`](mysql-cluster-ndbinfo-logspaces.md "25.6.16.43 The ndbinfo logspaces Table") table
- `log_part`

  The log part number
- `total`

  Total space available for this log
- `used`

  Space used by this log

##### Notes

`logbuffers` table rows reflecting two
additional log types are available when performing an NDB
backup. One of these rows has the log type
`BACKUP-DATA`, which shows the amount of data
buffer used during backup to copy fragments to backup files. The
other row has the log type `BACKUP-LOG`, which
displays the amount of log buffer used during the backup to
record changes made after the backup has started. One each of
these `log_type` rows is shown in the
`logbuffers` table for each data node in the
cluster. These rows are not present unless an NDB backup is
currently being performed.
