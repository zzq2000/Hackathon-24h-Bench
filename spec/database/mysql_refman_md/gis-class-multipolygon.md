#### 13.4.2.13 MultiPolygon Class

A `MultiPolygon` is a
`MultiSurface` object composed of
`Polygon` elements.

**`MultiPolygon`
Examples**

- On a region map, a `MultiPolygon` could
  represent a system of lakes.

**`MultiPolygon`
Assertions**

- A `MultiPolygon` has no two
  `Polygon` elements with interiors that
  intersect.
- A `MultiPolygon` has no two
  `Polygon` elements that cross (crossing
  is also forbidden by the previous assertion), or that
  touch at an infinite number of points.
- A `MultiPolygon` may not have cut lines,
  spikes, or punctures. A `MultiPolygon` is
  a regular, closed point set.
- A `MultiPolygon` that has more than one
  `Polygon` has an interior that is not
  connected. The number of connected components of the
  interior of a `MultiPolygon` is equal to
  the number of `Polygon` values in the
  `MultiPolygon`.

**`MultiPolygon`
Properties**

- A `MultiPolygon` is a two-dimensional
  geometry.
- A `MultiPolygon` boundary is a set of
  closed curves (`LineString` values)
  corresponding to the boundaries of its
  `Polygon` elements.
- Each `Curve` in the boundary of the
  `MultiPolygon` is in the boundary of
  exactly one `Polygon` element.
- Every `Curve` in the boundary of an
  `Polygon` element is in the boundary of
  the `MultiPolygon`.
