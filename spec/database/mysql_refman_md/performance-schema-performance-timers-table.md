#### 29.12.21.6 The performance\_timers Table

The [`performance_timers`](performance-schema-performance-timers-table.md "29.12.21.6 The performance_timers Table") table
shows which event timers are available:

```sql
mysql> SELECT * FROM performance_schema.performance_timers;
+-------------+-----------------+------------------+----------------+
| TIMER_NAME  | TIMER_FREQUENCY | TIMER_RESOLUTION | TIMER_OVERHEAD |
+-------------+-----------------+------------------+----------------+

If the values associated with a given timer name are
`NULL`, that timer is not supported on your
platform. For an explanation of how event timing occurs, see
[Section 29.4.1, “Performance Schema Event Timing”](performance-schema-timing.md "29.4.1 Performance Schema Event Timing").

The [`performance_timers`](performance-schema-performance-timers-table.md "29.12.21.6 The performance_timers Table") table has
these columns:

- `TIMER_NAME`

  The timer name.
- `TIMER_FREQUENCY`

  The number of timer units per second. For a cycle timer,
  the frequency is generally related to the CPU speed. For
  example, on a system with a 2.4GHz processor, the
  `CYCLE` may be close to 2400000000.
- `TIMER_RESOLUTION`

  Indicates the number of timer units by which timer values
  increase. If a timer has a resolution of 10, its value
  increases by 10 each time.
- `TIMER_OVERHEAD`

  The minimal number of cycles of overhead to obtain one
  timing with the given timer. The Performance Schema
  determines this value by invoking the timer 20 times
  during initialization and picking the smallest value. The
  total overhead really is twice this amount because the
  instrumentation invokes the timer at the start and end of
  each event. The timer code is called only for timed
  events, so this overhead does not apply for nontimed
  events.

The [`performance_timers`](performance-schema-performance-timers-table.md "29.12.21.6 The performance_timers Table") table has
no indexes.

[`TRUNCATE TABLE`](truncate-table.md "15.1.37 TRUNCATE TABLE Statement") is not permitted
for the [`performance_timers`](performance-schema-performance-timers-table.md "29.12.21.6 The performance_timers Table") table.
