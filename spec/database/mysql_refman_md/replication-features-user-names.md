#### 19.5.1.38 Replication and User Name Length

The maximum length for user names in MySQL 8.0 is
32 characters. Replication of user names longer than 16
characters fails when the replica runs a version of MySQL
previous to 5.7, because those versions support only shorter
user names. This occurs only when replicating from a newer
source to an older replica, which is not a recommended
configuration.
