#### 7.1.12.2 Administrative Connection Management

As mentioned in
[Connection Volume Management](connection-interfaces.md#connection-interfaces-volume-management "Connection Volume Management"), to
allow for the need to perform administrative operations even
when [`max_connections`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_max_connections)
connections are already established on the interfaces used for
ordinary connections, the MySQL server permits a single
administrative connection to users who have the
[`CONNECTION_ADMIN`](privileges-provided.md#priv_connection-admin) privilege (or
the deprecated [`SUPER`](privileges-provided.md#priv_super) privilege).

Additionally, as of MySQL 8.0.14, the server permits dedicating
a TCP/IP port for administrative connections, as described in
the following sections.

- [Administrative Interface Characteristics](administrative-connection-interface.md#administrative-interface-characteristics "Administrative Interface Characteristics")
- [Administrative Interface Support for Encrypted Connections](administrative-connection-interface.md#administrative-interface-encrypted-connections "Administrative Interface Support for Encrypted Connections")

##### Administrative Interface Characteristics

The administrative connection interface has these
characteristics:

- The server enables the interface only if the
  [`admin_address`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_admin_address) system
  variable is set at startup to indicate the IP address for
  it. If [`admin_address`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_admin_address) is
  not set, the server maintains no administrative interface.
- The [`admin_port`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_admin_port) system
  variable specifies the interface TCP/IP port number
  (default 33062).
- There is no limit on the number of administrative
  connections, but connections are permitted only for users
  who have the
  [`SERVICE_CONNECTION_ADMIN`](privileges-provided.md#priv_service-connection-admin)
  privilege.
- The
  [`create_admin_listener_thread`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_create_admin_listener_thread)
  system variable enables DBAs to choose at startup whether
  the administrative interface has its own separate thread.
  The default is `OFF`; that is, the
  manager thread for ordinary connections on the main
  interface also handles connections for the administrative
  interface.

These lines in the server `my.cnf` file
enable the administrative interface on the loopback interface
and configure it to use port number 33064 (that is, a port
different from the default):

```ini
[mysqld]
admin_address=127.0.0.1
admin_port=33064
```

MySQL client programs connect to either the main or
administrative interface by specifying appropriate connection
parameters. If the server running on the local host is using
the default TCP/IP port numbers of 3306 and 33062 for the main
and administrative interfaces, these commands connect to those
interfaces:

```terminal
mysql --protocol=TCP --port=3306
mysql --protocol=TCP --port=33062
```

##### Administrative Interface Support for Encrypted Connections

Prior to MySQL 8.0.21, the administrative interface supports
encrypted connections using the connection-encryption
configuration that applies to the main interface. As of MySQL
8.0.21, the administrative interface has its own configuration
parameters for encrypted connections. These correspond to the
main interface parameters but enable independent configuration
of encrypted connections for the administrative interface:

- The
  `admin_tls_xxx`
  and
  `admin_ssl_xxx`
  system variables are like the
  `tls_xxx` and
  `ssl_xxx`
  system variables, but they configure the TLS context for
  the administrative interface rather than the main
  interface.
- The [`--admin-ssl`](server-options.md#option_mysqld_admin-ssl) option is
  like the [`--ssl`](server-options.md#option_mysqld_ssl) option, but
  it enables or disables support for encrypted connections
  on the administrative interface rather than the main
  interface.

  Because support for encrypted connections is enabled by
  default, it is normally unnecessary to specify
  [`--admin-ssl`](server-options.md#option_mysqld_admin-ssl). As of MySQL
  8.0.26, [`--admin-ssl`](server-options.md#option_mysqld_admin-ssl) is
  deprecated and subject to removal in a future MySQL
  version.

For general information about configuring
connection-encryption support, see
[Section 8.3.1, “Configuring MySQL to Use Encrypted Connections”](using-encrypted-connections.md "8.3.1 Configuring MySQL to Use Encrypted Connections"), and
[Section 8.3.2, “Encrypted Connection TLS Protocols and Ciphers”](encrypted-connection-protocols-ciphers.md "8.3.2 Encrypted Connection TLS Protocols and Ciphers"). That
discussion is written for the main connection interface, but
the parameter names are similar for the administrative
connection interface. Use that discussion together with the
following remarks, which provide information specific to the
administrative interface.

TLS configuration for the administrative interface follows
these rules:

- If [`--admin-ssl`](server-options.md#option_mysqld_admin-ssl) is enabled
  (the default), the administrative interface supports
  encrypted connections. For connections on the interface,
  the applicable TLS context depends on whether any
  nondefault administrative TLS parameter is configured:

  - If all administrative TLS parameters have their
    default values, the administrative interface uses the
    same TLS context as the main interface.
  - If any administrative TLS parameter has a nondefault
    value, the administrative interface uses the TLS
    context defined by its own parameters. (This is the
    case if any
    `admin_tls_xxx`
    or
    `admin_ssl_xxx`
    system variable is set to a value different from its
    default.) If a valid TLS context cannot be created
    from those parameters, the administrative interface
    falls back to the main interface TLS context.
- If [`--admin-ssl`](server-options.md#option_mysqld_admin-ssl) is disabled
  (for example, by specifying
  [`--admin-ssl=OFF`](server-options.md#option_mysqld_admin-ssl), encrypted
  connections to the administrative interface are disabled.
  This is true even if administrative TLS parameters have
  nondefault values because disabling
  [`--admin-ssl`](server-options.md#option_mysqld_admin-ssl) takes
  precedence.

  It is also possible to disable encrypted connections on
  the administrative interface without specifying
  [`--admin-ssl`](server-options.md#option_mysqld_admin-ssl) in negated
  form. Set the
  [`admin_tls_version`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_admin_tls_version) system
  variable to the empty value to indicate that no TLS
  versions are supported. For example, these lines in the
  server `my.cnf` file disable encrypted
  connections on the administrative interface:

  ```ini
  [mysqld]
  admin_tls_version=''
  ```

Examples:

- This configuration in the server
  `my.cnf` file enables the
  administrative interface, but does not set any of the TLS
  parameters specific to that interface:

  ```ini
  [mysqld]
  admin_address=127.0.0.1
  ```

  As a result, the administrative interface supports
  encrypted connections (because encryption is supported by
  default when the administrative interface is enabled), and
  uses the main interface TLS context. When clients connect
  to the administrative interface, they should use the same
  certificate and key files as for ordinary connections on
  the main interface. For example (enter the command on a
  single line):

  ```terminal
  mysql --protocol=TCP --port=33062
        --ssl-ca=ca.pem
        --ssl-cert=client-cert.pem
        --ssl-key=client-key.pem
  ```
- This server configuration enables the administrative
  interface and sets the TLS certificate and key file
  parameters specific to that interface:

  ```ini
  [mysqld]
  admin_address=127.0.0.1
  admin_ssl_ca=admin-ca.pem
  admin_ssl_cert=admin-server-cert.pem
  admin_ssl_key=admin-server-key.pem
  ```

  As a result, the administrative interface supports
  encrypted connections using its own TLS context. When
  clients connect to the administrative interface, they
  should use certificate and key files specific to that
  interface. For example (enter the command on a single
  line):

  ```terminal
  mysql --protocol=TCP --port=33062
        --ssl-ca=admin-ca.pem
        --ssl-cert=admin-client-cert.pem
        --ssl-key=admin-client-key.pem
  ```
