#### 20.2.1.1 Deploying Instances for Group Replication

The first step is to deploy at least three instances of MySQL
Server, this procedure demonstrates using multiple hosts for the
instances, named s1, s2, and s3. It is assumed that MySQL Server
is installed on each host (see [Chapter 2, *Installing MySQL*](installing.md "Chapter 2 Installing MySQL")).
The Group Replication plugin is provided with MySQL Server
8.0; no additional software is required, although
the plugin must be installed in the running MySQL server. See
[Section 20.2.1.1, “Deploying Instances for Group Replication”](group-replication-deploying-instances.md "20.2.1.1 Deploying Instances for Group Replication"); for
additional information, see [Section 7.6, “MySQL Server Plugins”](server-plugins.md "7.6 MySQL Server Plugins").

In this example, three instances are used for the group, which
is the minimum number of instances to create a group. Adding
more instances increases the fault tolerance of the group. For
example if the group consists of three members, in event of
failure of one instance the group can continue. But in the event
of another failure the group can no longer continue processing
write transactions. By adding more instances, the number of
servers which can fail while the group continues to process
transactions also increases. The maximum number of instances
which can be used in a group is nine. For more information see
[Section 20.1.4.2, “Failure Detection”](group-replication-failure-detection.md "20.1.4.2 Failure Detection").
