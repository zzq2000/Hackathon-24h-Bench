#### B.3.4.4 Problems with Column Aliases

An alias can be used in a query select list to give a column a
different name. You can use the alias in `GROUP
BY`, `ORDER BY`, or
`HAVING` clauses to refer to the column:

```sql
SELECT SQRT(a*b) AS root FROM tbl_name
  GROUP BY root HAVING root > 0;
SELECT id, COUNT(*) AS cnt FROM tbl_name
  GROUP BY id HAVING cnt > 0;
SELECT id AS 'Customer identity' FROM tbl_name;
```

Standard SQL disallows references to column aliases in a
`WHERE` clause. This restriction is imposed
because when the `WHERE` clause is evaluated,
the column value may not yet have been determined. For
example, the following query is illegal:

```sql
SELECT id, COUNT(*) AS cnt FROM tbl_name
  WHERE cnt > 0 GROUP BY id;
```

The `WHERE` clause determines which rows
should be included in the `GROUP BY` clause,
but it refers to the alias of a column value that is not known
until after the rows have been selected, and grouped by the
`GROUP BY`.

In the select list of a query, a quoted column alias can be
specified using identifier or string quoting characters:

```sql
SELECT 1 AS `one`, 2 AS 'two';
```

Elsewhere in the statement, quoted references to the alias
must use identifier quoting or the reference is treated as a
string literal. For example, this statement groups by the
values in column `id`, referenced using the
alias `` `a` ``:

```sql
SELECT id AS 'a', COUNT(*) AS cnt FROM tbl_name
  GROUP BY `a`;
```

This statement groups by the literal string
`'a'` and does not work as you may expect:

```sql
SELECT id AS 'a', COUNT(*) AS cnt FROM tbl_name
  GROUP BY 'a';
```
