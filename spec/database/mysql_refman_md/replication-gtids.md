This section explains transaction-based replication using
global transaction identifiers
(GTIDs). When using GTIDs, each transaction can be identified and
tracked as it is committed on the originating server and applied by
any replicas; this means that it is not necessary when using GTIDs
to refer to log files or positions within those files when starting
a new replica or failing over to a new source, which greatly
simplifies these tasks. Because GTID-based replication is completely
transaction-based, it is simple to determine whether sources and
replicas are consistent; as long as all transactions committed on a
source are also committed on a replica, consistency between the two
is guaranteed. You can use either statement-based or row-based
replication with GTIDs (see [Section 19.2.1, “Replication Formats”](replication-formats.md "19.2.1 Replication Formats"));
however, for best results, we recommend that you use the row-based
format.

GTIDs are always preserved between source and replica. This means
that you can always determine the source for any transaction applied
on any replica by examining its binary log. In addition, once a
transaction with a given GTID is committed on a given server, any
subsequent transaction having the same GTID is ignored by that
server. Thus, a transaction committed on the source can be applied
no more than once on the replica, which helps to guarantee
consistency.

This section discusses the following topics:

- How GTIDs are defined and created, and how they are represented
  in a MySQL server (see
  [Section 19.1.3.1, “GTID Format and Storage”](replication-gtids-concepts.md "19.1.3.1 GTID Format and Storage")).
- The life cycle of a GTID (see
  [Section 19.1.3.2, “GTID Life Cycle”](replication-gtids-lifecycle.md "19.1.3.2 GTID Life Cycle")).
- The auto-positioning function for synchronizing a replica and
  source that use GTIDs (see
  [Section 19.1.3.3, “GTID Auto-Positioning”](replication-gtids-auto-positioning.md "19.1.3.3 GTID Auto-Positioning")).
- A general procedure for setting up and starting GTID-based
  replication (see [Section 19.1.3.4, “Setting Up Replication Using GTIDs”](replication-gtids-howto.md "19.1.3.4 Setting Up Replication Using GTIDs")).
- Suggested methods for provisioning new replication servers when
  using GTIDs (see [Section 19.1.3.5, “Using GTIDs for Failover and Scaleout”](replication-gtids-failover.md "19.1.3.5 Using GTIDs for Failover and Scaleout")).
- Restrictions and limitations that you should be aware of when
  using GTID-based replication (see
  [Section 19.1.3.7, “Restrictions on Replication with GTIDs”](replication-gtids-restrictions.md "19.1.3.7 Restrictions on Replication with GTIDs")).
- Stored functions that you can use to work with GTIDs (see
  [Section 19.1.3.8, “Stored Function Examples to Manipulate GTIDs”](replication-gtids-functions.md "19.1.3.8 Stored Function Examples to Manipulate GTIDs")).

GTID-based replication, see

[Section 14.18.2, “Functions Used with Global Transaction Identifiers (GTIDs)”](gtid-functions.md "14.18.2 Functions Used with Global Transaction Identifiers (GTIDs)"), which describes SQL functions
supported by MySQL 8.0 for use with GTIDs.
