### 7.1.8 Server System Variables

The MySQL server maintains many system variables that affect its
operation. Most system variables can be set at server startup
using options on the command line or in an option file. Most of
them can be changed dynamically at runtime using the
[`SET`](set-variable.md "15.7.6.1 SET Syntax for Variable Assignment")
statement, which enables you to modify operation of the server
without having to stop and restart it. Some variables are
read-only, and their values are determined by the system
environment, by how MySQL is installed on the system, or possibly
by the options used to compile MySQL. Most system variables have a
default value, but there are exceptions, including read-only
variables. You can also use system variable values in expressions.

Setting a global system variable runtime value normally requires
the [`SYSTEM_VARIABLES_ADMIN`](privileges-provided.md#priv_system-variables-admin)
privilege (or the deprecated [`SUPER`](privileges-provided.md#priv_super)
privilege). Setting a session system runtime variable value
normally requires no special privileges and can be done by any
user, although there are exceptions. For more information, see
[Section 7.1.9.1, “System Variable Privileges”](system-variable-privileges.md "7.1.9.1 System Variable Privileges")

There are several ways to see the names and values of system
variables:

- To see the values that a server uses based on its compiled-in
  defaults and any option files that it reads, use this command:

  ```terminal
  mysqld --verbose --help
  ```
- To see the values that a server uses based only on its
  compiled-in defaults, ignoring the settings in any option
  files, use this command:

  ```terminal
  mysqld --no-defaults --verbose --help
  ```
- To see the current values used by a running server, use the
  [`SHOW VARIABLES`](show-variables.md "15.7.7.41 SHOW VARIABLES Statement") statement or the
  Performance Schema system variable tables. See
  [Section 29.12.14, “Performance Schema System Variable Tables”](performance-schema-system-variable-tables.md "29.12.14 Performance Schema System Variable Tables").

This section provides a description of each system variable. For a
system variable summary table, see
[Section 7.1.5, “Server System Variable Reference”](server-system-variable-reference.md "7.1.5 Server System Variable Reference"). For more
information about manipulation of system variables, see
[Section 7.1.9, “Using System Variables”](using-system-variables.md "7.1.9 Using System Variables").

For additional system variable information, see these sections:

- [Section 7.1.9, “Using System Variables”](using-system-variables.md "7.1.9 Using System Variables"), discusses the syntax
  for setting and displaying system variable values.
- [Section 7.1.9.2, “Dynamic System Variables”](dynamic-system-variables.md "7.1.9.2 Dynamic System Variables"), lists the
  variables that can be set at runtime.
- Information on tuning system variables can be found in
  [Section 7.1.1, “Configuring the Server”](server-configuration.md "7.1.1 Configuring the Server").
- [Section 17.14, “InnoDB Startup Options and System Variables”](innodb-parameters.md "17.14 InnoDB Startup Options and System Variables"), lists
  `InnoDB` system variables.
- [Section 25.4.3.9.2, “NDB Cluster System Variables”](mysql-cluster-options-variables.md#mysql-cluster-system-variables "25.4.3.9.2 NDB Cluster System Variables"), lists system
  variables which are specific to NDB Cluster.
- For information on server system variables specific to
  replication, see [Section 19.1.6, “Replication and Binary Logging Options and Variables”](replication-options.md "19.1.6 Replication and Binary Logging Options and Variables").

Note

Some of the following variable descriptions refer to
“enabling” or “disabling” a variable.
These variables can be enabled with the
[`SET`](set-variable.md "15.7.6.1 SET Syntax for Variable Assignment")
statement by setting them to `ON` or
`1`, or disabled by setting them to
`OFF` or `0`. Boolean
variables can be set at startup to the values
`ON`, `TRUE`,
`OFF`, and `FALSE` (not
case-sensitive), as well as `1` and
`0`. See [Section 6.2.2.4, “Program Option Modifiers”](option-modifiers.md "6.2.2.4 Program Option Modifiers").

Some system variables control the size of buffers or caches. For a
given buffer, the server might need to allocate internal data
structures. These structures typically are allocated from the
total memory allocated to the buffer, and the amount of space
required might be platform dependent. This means that when you
assign a value to a system variable that controls a buffer size,
the amount of space actually available might differ from the value
assigned. In some cases, the amount might be less than the value
assigned. It is also possible that the server adjusts a value
upward. For example, if you assign a value of 0 to a variable for
which the minimal value is 1024, the server sets the value to
1024.

Values for buffer sizes, lengths, and stack sizes are given in
bytes unless otherwise specified.

Note

Some system variable descriptions include a block size, in which
case a value that is not an integer multiple of the stated block
size is rounded down to the next lower multiple of the block
size before being stored by the server, that is to
[`FLOOR(value)`](mathematical-functions.md#function_floor)
`* block_size`.

*Example*: Suppose that the block size for a
given variable is given as 4096, and you set the value of the
variable to 100000 (we assume that the variable's maximum
value is greater than this number). Since 100000 / 4096 =
24.4140625, the server automatically lowers the value to 98304
(24 \* 4096) before storing it.

In some cases, the stated maximum for a variable is the maximum
allowed by the MySQL parser, but is not an exact multiple of the
block size. In such cases, the effective maximum is the next
lower multiple of the block size.

*Example*: A system variable's maxmum
value is shown as 4294967295 (232-1),
and its block size is 1024. 4294967295 / 1024 =
4194303.9990234375, so if you set this variable to its stated
maximum, the value actually stored is 4194303 \* 1024 =
4294966272.

Some system variables take file name values. Unless otherwise
specified, the default file location is the data directory if the
value is a relative path name. To specify the location explicitly,
use an absolute path name. Suppose that the data directory is
`/var/mysql/data`. If a file-valued variable is
given as a relative path name, it is located under
`/var/mysql/data`. If the value is an absolute
path name, its location is as given by the path name.

  Whether to enable automatic activation of all granted roles
  when users log in to the server:

  - If
    [`activate_all_roles_on_login`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_activate_all_roles_on_login)
    is enabled, the server activates all roles granted to each
    account at login time. This takes precedence over default
    roles specified with [`SET DEFAULT
    ROLE`](set-default-role.md "15.7.1.9 SET DEFAULT ROLE Statement").
  - If
    [`activate_all_roles_on_login`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_activate_all_roles_on_login)
    is disabled, the server activates the default roles
    specified with [`SET DEFAULT
    ROLE`](set-default-role.md "15.7.1.9 SET DEFAULT ROLE Statement"), if any, at login time.

  Granted roles include those granted explicitly to the user and
  those named in the
  [`mandatory_roles`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_mandatory_roles) system
  variable value.

  [`activate_all_roles_on_login`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_activate_all_roles_on_login)
  applies only at login time, and at the beginning of execution
  for stored programs and views that execute in definer context.
  To change the active roles within a session, use
  [`SET ROLE`](set-role.md "15.7.1.11 SET ROLE Statement"). To change the active
  roles for a stored program, the program body should execute
  [`SET ROLE`](set-role.md "15.7.1.11 SET ROLE Statement").

  | Type | String |

  The IP address on which to listen for TCP/IP connections on
  the administrative network interface (see
  [Section 7.1.12.1, “Connection Interfaces”](connection-interfaces.md "7.1.12.1 Connection Interfaces")). There is no default
  [`admin_address`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_admin_address) value. If this
  variable is not specified at startup, the server maintains no
  administrative interface. The server also has a
  [`bind_address`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_bind_address) system variable
  for configuring regular (nonadministrative) client TCP/IP
  connections. See [Section 7.1.12.1, “Connection Interfaces”](connection-interfaces.md "7.1.12.1 Connection Interfaces").

  If [`admin_address`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_admin_address) is
  specified, its value must satisfy these requirements:

  - The value must be a single IPv4 address, IPv6 address, or
    host name.
  - The value cannot specify a wildcard address format
    (`*`, `0.0.0.0`, or
    `::`).
  - As of MySQL 8.0.22, the value may include a network
    namespace specifier.

  An IP address can be specified as an IPv4 or IPv6 address. If
  the value is a host name, the server resolves the name to an
  IP address and binds to that address. If a host name resolves
  to multiple IP addresses, the server uses the first IPv4
  address if there are any, or the first IPv6 address otherwise.

  The server treats different types of addresses as follows:

  - If the address is an IPv4-mapped address, the server
    accepts TCP/IP connections for that address, in either
    IPv4 or IPv6 format. For example, if the server is bound
    to `::ffff:127.0.0.1`, clients can
    connect using `--host=127.0.0.1` or
    `--host=::ffff:127.0.0.1`.
  - If the address is a “regular” IPv4 or IPv6
    address (such as `127.0.0.1` or
    `::1`), the server accepts TCP/IP
    connections only for that IPv4 or IPv6 address.

  These rules apply to specifying a network namespace for an
  address:

  - A network namespace can be specified for an IP address or
    a host name.
  - A network namespace cannot be specified for a wildcard IP
    address.
  - For a given address, the network namespace is optional. If
    given, it must be specified as a
    `/ns` suffix
    immediately following the address.
  - An address with no
    `/ns` suffix
    uses the host system global namespace. The global
    namespace is therefore the default.
  - An address with a
    `/ns` suffix
    uses the namespace named *`ns`*.
  - The host system must support network namespaces and each
    named namespace must previously have been set up. Naming a
    nonexistent namespace produces an error.

  For additional information about network namespaces, see
  [Section 7.1.14, “Network Namespace Support”](network-namespace-support.md "7.1.14 Network Namespace Support").

  If binding to the address fails, the server produces an error
  and does not start.

  The [`admin_address`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_admin_address) system
  variable is similar to the
  [`bind_address`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_bind_address) system variable
  that binds the server to an address for ordinary client
  connections, but with these differences:

  - [`bind_address`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_bind_address) permits
    multiple addresses.
    [`admin_address`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_admin_address) permits a
    single address.
  - [`bind_address`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_bind_address) permits
    wildcard addresses.
    [`admin_address`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_admin_address) does not.
- [`admin_port`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_admin_port)

  |  |  |

  The TCP/IP port number to use for connections on the
  administrative network interface (see
  [Section 7.1.12.1, “Connection Interfaces”](connection-interfaces.md "7.1.12.1 Connection Interfaces")). Setting this
  variable to 0 causes the default value to be used.

  Setting [`admin_port`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_admin_port) has no
  effect if [`admin_address`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_admin_address) is
  not specified because in that case the server maintains no
  administrative network interface.

  Important

  - Support for the TLSv1 and TLSv1.1 connection protocols
    is removed from MySQL Server as of MySQL 8.0.28. The
    protocols were deprecated from MySQL 8.0.26. See
    [Removal of Support for the TLSv1 and TLSv1.1 Protocols](encrypted-connection-protocols-ciphers.md#encrypted-connection-deprecated-protocols "Removal of Support for the TLSv1 and TLSv1.1 Protocols")
    for more information.
  - Support for the TLSv1.3 protocol is available in MySQL
    Server as of MySQL 8.0.16, provided that MySQL Server
    was compiled using OpenSSL 1.1.1 or higher. The server
    checks the version of OpenSSL at startup, and if it is
    lower than 1.1.1, TLSv1.3 is removed from the default
    value for the system variable. In that case, the
    defaults are
    “`TLSv1,TLSv1.1,TLSv1.2`”
    up to and including MySQL 8.0.27, and
    “`TLSv1.2`” from MySQL
    8.0.28.

  This variable is used to administer multifactor authentication
  (MFA) capabilities. It applies to the authentication
  factor-related clauses of [`CREATE
  USER`](create-user.md "15.7.1.3 CREATE USER Statement") and [`ALTER USER`](alter-user.md "15.7.1.1 ALTER USER Statement")
  statements used to manage MySQL account definitions, where
  “factor” corresponds to an authentication method
  or plugin associated with an account:

  - [`authentication_policy`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_authentication_policy)
    controls the number of authentication factors that
    accounts may have. That is, it controls which factors are
    required or permitted.
  - [`authentication_policy`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_authentication_policy)
    also controls, for each factor, which plugins (or methods)
    are permitted.
  - [`authentication_policy`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_authentication_policy), in
    conjunction with
    [`default_authentication_plugin`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_default_authentication_plugin),
    determines the default authentication plugin for
    authentication specifications that do not name a plugin
    explicitly.

  Because [`authentication_policy`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_authentication_policy)
  applies only when accounts are created or altered, changes to
  its value have no effect on existing user accounts.

  Note

  Although the
  [`authentication_policy`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_authentication_policy)
  system variable places certain constraints on the
  authentication-related clauses of
  [`CREATE USER`](create-user.md "15.7.1.3 CREATE USER Statement") and
  [`ALTER USER`](alter-user.md "15.7.1.1 ALTER USER Statement") statements, a user
  who has the
  [`AUTHENTICATION_POLICY_ADMIN`](privileges-provided.md#priv_authentication-policy-admin)
  privilege is not subject to the constraints. (A warning does
  occur for statements that otherwise would not be permitted.)

  The value of
  [`authentication_policy`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_authentication_policy) is a
  list of 1, 2, or 3 comma-separated elements. Each element
  present can be an authentication plugin name, an asterisk
  (`*`), empty, or missing. (Exception: Element
  1 cannot be empty or missing.) In all cases, an element may be
  surrounded by whitespace characters and the entire list is
  enclosed in single quotes.

  The type of value specified for element
  *`N`* in the list has implications for
  whether factor *`N`* must be present in
  account definitions, and which authentication plugins can be
  used:

  - If element *`N`* is an
    authentication plugin name, an authentication method for
    factor *`N`* is required and must
    use the named plugin.

    In addition, the plugin becomes the default plugin for
    factor *`N`* authentication methods
    that do not name a plugin explicitly. For details, see
    [The Default Authentication Plugin](pluggable-authentication.md#pluggable-authentication-default-plugin "The Default Authentication Plugin").

    Authentication plugins that use internal credentials
    storage can be specified for the first element only, and
    cannot repeat. For example, the following settings are not
    permitted:

    - `authentication_policy =
      'caching_sha2_password, sha256_password'`
    - `authentication_policy =
      'caching_sha2_password, authentication_fido,
      sha256_password'`
  - If element *`N`* is an asterisk
    (`*`), an authentication method for
    factor *`N`* is required. It may
    use any authentication plugin that is valid for element
    *`N`* (as described later).
  - If element *`N`* is empty, an
    authentication method for factor
    *`N`* is optional. If given, it may
    use any authentication plugin that is valid for element
    *`N`* (as described later).
  - If element *`N`* is missing from
    the list (that is, there are fewer than
    *`N`*−1 commas in the value),
    an authentication method for factor
    *`N`* is forbidden. For example, a
    value of `'*'` permits only a single
    factor and thus enforces single-factor authentication
    (1FA) for new accounts created with
    [`CREATE USER`](create-user.md "15.7.1.3 CREATE USER Statement") or changes to
    existing accounts made with [`ALTER
    USER`](alter-user.md "15.7.1.1 ALTER USER Statement"). In this case, such statements cannot
    specify authentication for factors 2 or 3.

  When an [`authentication_policy`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_authentication_policy)
  element names an authentication plugin, the permitted plugin
  names for the element are subject to these conditions:

  - Element 1 must name a plugin that does not require a
    registration step. For example,
    `authentication_fido` cannot be named.
  - Elements 2 and 3 must name a plugin that does not use
    internal credentials storage.

    For information about which authentication plugins use
    internal credentials storage, see
    [Section 8.2.15, “Password Management”](password-management.md "8.2.15 Password Management").

  When [`authentication_policy`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_authentication_policy)
  element *`N`* is `*`,
  the permitted plugin names for factor
  *`N`* in account definitions are
  subject to these conditions:

  - For factor 1, account definitions can use any plugin.
    Default authentication plugin rules apply for
    authentication specifications that do not name a plugin.
    See
    [The Default Authentication Plugin](pluggable-authentication.md#pluggable-authentication-default-plugin "The Default Authentication Plugin").
  - For factors 2 and 3, account definitions cannot name a
    plugin that uses internal credentials storage. For
    example, with '`*,*`',
    '`*,*,*`', '`*,`',
    '`*,,`'
    [`authentication_policy`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_authentication_policy)
    settings, plugins that use internal credentials storage
    are only permitted for the first factor and cannot repeat.

  When [`authentication_policy`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_authentication_policy)
  element *`N`* is empty, the permitted
  plugin names for factor *`N`* in
  account definitions are subject to these conditions:

  - For factor 1, this does not apply because element 1 cannot
    be empty.
  - For factors 2 and 3, account definitions cannot name a
    plugin that uses internal credentials storage.

  Empty elements must occur at the end of the list, following a
  nonempty element. In other words, the first element cannot be
  empty, and either no element is empty or the last element is
  empty or the last two elements are empty. For example, a value
  of `',,'` is not permitted because it would
  signify that all factors are optional. That cannot be;
  accounts must have at least one authentication factor.

  The default value of
  [`authentication_policy`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_authentication_policy) is
  `'*,,'`. This means that factor 1 is required
  in account definitions and can use any authentication plugin,
  and that factors 2 and 3 are optional and each can use any
  authentication plugin that does not use internal credentials
  storage.

  The following table shows some
  [`authentication_policy`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_authentication_policy) values
  and the policy that each establishes for creating or altering
  accounts.

  **Table 7.4 Example authentication\_policy Values**

  | authentication\_policy Value | Effective Policy |
  | --- | --- |
  | `'*'` | Permit only creating or altering accounts with one factor. |
  | `'*,*'` | Permit only creating or altering accounts with two factors. |
  | `'*,*,*'` | Permit only creating or altering accounts with three factors. |
  | `'*,'` | Permit creating or altering accounts with one or two factors. |
  | `'*,,'` | Permit creating or altering accounts with one, two, or three factors. |
  | `'*,*,'` | Permit creating or altering accounts with two or three factors. |
  | `'*,auth_plugin'` | Permit creating or altering accounts with two factors, where the first factor can be any authentication method, and the second factor must be the named plugin. |
  | `'auth_plugin,*,'` | Permit creating or altering accounts with two or three factors, where the first factor must be the named plugin. |
  | `'auth_plugin,'` | Permit creating or altering accounts with one or two factors, where the first factor must be the named plugin. |
  | `'auth_plugin,auth_plugin,auth_plugin'` | Permits creating or altering accounts with three factors, where the factors must use the named plugins. |

  This variable is available only if the
  `authentication_windows` Windows
  authentication plugin is enabled and debugging code is
  enabled. See
  [Section 8.4.1.6, “Windows Pluggable Authentication”](windows-pluggable-authentication.md "8.4.1.6 Windows Pluggable Authentication").

  This variable sets the logging level for the Windows

  values.

  | Value | Description |
  | --- | --- |
  | 0 | No logging |
  | 1 | Log only error messages |

  This variable is available only if the
  `authentication_windows` Windows
  authentication plugin is enabled. See
  [Section 8.4.1.6, “Windows Pluggable Authentication”](windows-pluggable-authentication.md "8.4.1.6 Windows Pluggable Authentication").

  A client that authenticates using the
  `InitSecurityContext()` function should
  provide a string identifying the service to which it connects
  (*`targetName`*). MySQL uses the
  principal name (UPN) of the account under which the server is
  running. The UPN has the form
  `user_id@computer_name`
  and need not be registered anywhere to be used. This UPN is
  sent by the server at the beginning of authentication
  handshake.

  This variable controls whether the server sends the UPN in the
  initial challenge. By default, the variable is enabled. For
  security reasons, it can be disabled to avoid sending the
  server's account name to a client as cleartext. If the
  variable is disabled, the server always sends a
  `0x00` byte in the first challenge, the
  client does not specify *`targetName`*,
  and as a result, NTLM authentication is used.

  If the server fails to obtain its UPN (which happens primarily
  in environments that do not support Kerberos authentication),
  the UPN is not sent by the server and NTLM authentication is
  used.
- [`autocommit`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_autocommit)

  |  |  |
  | --- | --- |
  | Command-Line Format | `--autocommit[={OFF|ON}]` |
  | System Variable | `autocommit` |
  | Scope | Global, Session |
  | Dynamic | Yes |
  | [`SET_VAR`](optimizer-hints.md#optimizer-hints-set-var "Variable-Setting Hint Syntax") Hint Applies | No |
  | Type | Boolean |
  | Default Value | `ON` |

  The autocommit mode. If set to 1, all changes to a table take
  effect immediately. If set to 0, you must use
  [`COMMIT`](commit.md "15.3.1 START TRANSACTION, COMMIT, and ROLLBACK Statements") to accept a transaction
  or [`ROLLBACK`](commit.md "15.3.1 START TRANSACTION, COMMIT, and ROLLBACK Statements")
  to cancel it. If [`autocommit`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_autocommit)
  is 0 and you change it to 1, MySQL performs an automatic
  [`COMMIT`](commit.md "15.3.1 START TRANSACTION, COMMIT, and ROLLBACK Statements") of any open transaction.
  Another way to begin a transaction is to use a
  [`START
  TRANSACTION`](commit.md "15.3.1 START TRANSACTION, COMMIT, and ROLLBACK Statements") or
  [`BEGIN`](commit.md "15.3.1 START TRANSACTION, COMMIT, and ROLLBACK Statements")
  statement. See [Section 15.3.1, “START TRANSACTION, COMMIT, and ROLLBACK Statements”](commit.md "15.3.1 START TRANSACTION, COMMIT, and ROLLBACK Statements").

  By default, client connections begin with
  [`autocommit`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_autocommit) set to 1. To cause
  clients to begin with a default of 0, set the global
  [`autocommit`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_autocommit) value by starting
  the server with the
  [`--autocommit=0`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_autocommit) option. To set
  the variable using an option file, include these lines:

  ```ini
  [mysqld]
  autocommit=0
  ```
- [`automatic_sp_privileges`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_automatic_sp_privileges)

  |  |  |

  | [`SET_VAR`](optimizer-hints.md#optimizer-hints-set-var "Variable-Setting Hint Syntax") Hint Applies | No |
  | Type | Boolean |
  | Default Value | `ON` |

  When this variable has a value of 1 (the default), the server
  automatically grants the
  [`EXECUTE`](privileges-provided.md#priv_execute) and
  [`ALTER ROUTINE`](privileges-provided.md#priv_alter-routine) privileges to the
  creator of a stored routine, if the user cannot already
  execute and alter or drop the routine. (The
  [`ALTER ROUTINE`](privileges-provided.md#priv_alter-routine) privilege is
  required to drop the routine.) The server also automatically
  drops those privileges from the creator when the routine is
  dropped. If
  [`automatic_sp_privileges`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_automatic_sp_privileges) is 0,
  the server does not automatically add or drop these
  privileges.

  The creator of a routine is the account used to execute the
  `CREATE` statement for it. This might not be
  the same as the account named as the
  `DEFINER` in the routine definition.

  If you start [**mysqld**](mysqld.md "6.3.1 mysqld — The MySQL Server") with
  [`--skip-new`](server-options.md#option_mysqld_skip-new),
  [`automatic_sp_privileges`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_automatic_sp_privileges) is
  set to `OFF`.

  See also [Section 27.2.2, “Stored Routines and MySQL Privileges”](stored-routines-privileges.md "27.2.2 Stored Routines and MySQL Privileges").

  This variable controls whether the server autogenerates SSL
  key and certificate files in the data directory, if they do
  not already exist.

  At startup, the server automatically generates server-side and
  client-side SSL certificate and key files in the data
  directory if the
  [`auto_generate_certs`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_auto_generate_certs) system
  variable is enabled, no SSL options other than
  [`--ssl`](server-options.md#option_mysqld_ssl) are specified, and the
  server-side SSL files are missing from the data directory.
  These files enable secure client connections using SSL; see
  [Section 8.3.1, “Configuring MySQL to Use Encrypted Connections”](using-encrypted-connections.md "8.3.1 Configuring MySQL to Use Encrypted Connections").

  For more information about SSL file autogeneration, including
  file names and characteristics, see
  [Section 8.3.3.1, “Creating SSL and RSA Certificates and Keys using MySQL”](creating-ssl-rsa-files-using-mysql.md "8.3.3.1 Creating SSL and RSA Certificates and Keys using MySQL")

  and
  [`caching_sha2_password_auto_generate_rsa_keys`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_caching_sha2_password_auto_generate_rsa_keys)
  system variables are related but control autogeneration of RSA
  key-pair files needed for secure password exchange using RSA
  over unencrypted connections.

  | [`SET_VAR`](optimizer-hints.md#optimizer-hints-set-var "Variable-Setting Hint Syntax") Hint Applies | No |
  | Type | Boolean |

  This variable controls whether [`ALTER
  TABLE`](alter-table.md "15.1.9 ALTER TABLE Statement") implicitly upgrades temporal columns found to
  be in pre-5.6.4 format ([`TIME`](time.md "13.2.3 The TIME Type"),
  [`DATETIME`](datetime.md "13.2.2 The DATE, DATETIME, and TIMESTAMP Types"), and
  [`TIMESTAMP`](datetime.md "13.2.2 The DATE, DATETIME, and TIMESTAMP Types") columns without
  support for fractional seconds precision). Upgrading such
  columns requires a table rebuild, which prevents any use of
  fast alterations that might otherwise apply to the operation
  to be performed.

  This variable is disabled by default. Enabling it causes
  [`ALTER TABLE`](alter-table.md "15.1.9 ALTER TABLE Statement") not to rebuild
  temporal columns and thereby be able to take advantage of
  possible fast alterations.

  This variable is deprecated; expect it to be removed in a
  future MySQL release.
- [`back_log`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_back_log)

  | Default Value | `-1` (signifies autosizing; do not assign this literal value) |
  | Minimum Value | `1` |
  | Maximum Value | `65535` |

  The number of outstanding connection requests MySQL can have.
  This comes into play when the main MySQL thread gets very many
  connection requests in a very short time. It then takes some
  time (although very little) for the main thread to check the
  connection and start a new thread. The
  [`back_log`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_back_log) value indicates how
  many requests can be stacked during this short time before
  MySQL momentarily stops answering new requests. You need to
  increase this only if you expect a large number of connections
  in a short period of time.

  In other words, this value is the size of the listen queue for
  incoming TCP/IP connections. Your operating system has its own
  limit on the size of this queue. The manual page for the Unix
  `listen()` system call should have more
  details. Check your OS documentation for the maximum value for
  this variable. [`back_log`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_back_log)
  cannot be set higher than your operating system limit.

  The default value is the value of
  [`max_connections`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_max_connections), which
  enables the permitted backlog to adjust to the maximum
  permitted number of connections.

  | Type | Boolean |
  | Default Value | `OFF` |

  If enabled, the server stores all temporary tables on disk
  rather than in memory. This prevents most `The table
  tbl_name is full` errors
  for [`SELECT`](select.md "15.2.13 SELECT Statement") operations that
  require a large temporary table, but also slows down queries
  for which in-memory tables would suffice.

  The default value for new connections is
  `OFF` (use in-memory temporary tables).
  Normally, it should never be necessary to enable this
  variable. When in-memory *internal*
  temporary tables are managed by the
  `TempTable` storage engine (the default), and
  the maximum amount of memory that can be occupied by the
  `TempTable` storage engine is exceeded, the
  `TempTable` storage engine starts storing
  data to temporary files on disk. When in-memory temporary
  tables are managed by the `MEMORY` storage
  engine, in-memory tables are automatically converted to
  disk-based tables as required. For more information, see
  [Section 10.4.4, “Internal Temporary Table Use in MySQL”](internal-temporary-tables.md "10.4.4 Internal Temporary Table Use in MySQL").

  The MySQL server listens on one or more network sockets for
  TCP/IP connections. Each socket is bound to one address, but
  it is possible for an address to map onto multiple network
  interfaces. To specify how the server should listen for TCP/IP
  connections, set the
  [`bind_address`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_bind_address) system variable
  at server startup. The server also has an
  [`admin_address`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_admin_address) system variable
  that enables administrative connections on a dedicated
  interface. See [Section 7.1.12.1, “Connection Interfaces”](connection-interfaces.md "7.1.12.1 Connection Interfaces").

  If [`bind_address`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_bind_address) is specified,
  its value must satisfy these requirements:

  - Prior to MySQL 8.0.13,
    [`bind_address`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_bind_address) accepts a
    single address value, which may specify a single
    non-wildcard IP address or host name, or one of the
    wildcard address formats that permit listening on multiple
    network interfaces (`*`,
    `0.0.0.0`, or `::`).
  - As of MySQL 8.0.13,
    [`bind_address`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_bind_address) accepts
    either a single value as just described, or a list of
    comma-separated values. When the variable names a list of
    multiple values, each value must specify a single
    non-wildcard IP address (either IPv4 or IPv6) or a host
    name. Wildcard address formats (`*`,
    `0.0.0.0`, or `::`) are
    not allowed in a list of values.
  - As of MySQL 8.0.22, addresses may include a network
    namespace specifier.

  IP addresses can be specified as IPv4 or IPv6 addresses. For
  any value that is a host name, the server resolves the name to
  an IP address and binds to that address. If a host name
  resolves to multiple IP addresses, the server uses the first
  IPv4 address if there are any, or the first IPv6 address
  otherwise.

  The server treats different types of addresses as follows:

  - If the address is `*`, the server accepts
    TCP/IP connections on all server host IPv4 interfaces,
    and, if the server host supports IPv6, on all IPv6
    interfaces. Use this address to permit both IPv4 and IPv6
    connections on all server interfaces. This value is the
    default. If the variable specifies a list of multiple
    values, this value is not permitted.
  - If the address is `0.0.0.0`, the server
    accepts TCP/IP connections on all server host IPv4
    interfaces. If the variable specifies a list of multiple
    values, this value is not permitted.
  - If the address is `::`, the server
    accepts TCP/IP connections on all server host IPv4 and
    IPv6 interfaces. If the variable specifies a list of
    multiple values, this value is not permitted.
  - If the address is an IPv4-mapped address, the server
    accepts TCP/IP connections for that address, in either
    IPv4 or IPv6 format. For example, if the server is bound
    to `::ffff:127.0.0.1`, clients can
    connect using `--host=127.0.0.1` or
    `--host=::ffff:127.0.0.1`.
  - If the address is a “regular” IPv4 or IPv6
    address (such as `127.0.0.1` or
    `::1`), the server accepts TCP/IP
    connections only for that IPv4 or IPv6 address.

  These rules apply to specifying a network namespace for an
  address:

  - A network namespace can be specified for an IP address or
    a host name.
  - A network namespace cannot be specified for a wildcard IP
    address.
  - For a given address, the network namespace is optional. If
    given, it must be specified as a
    `/ns` suffix
    immediately following the address.
  - An address with no
    `/ns` suffix
    uses the host system global namespace. The global
    namespace is therefore the default.
  - An address with a
    `/ns` suffix
    uses the namespace named *`ns`*.
  - The host system must support network namespaces and each
    named namespace must previously have been set up. Naming a
    nonexistent namespace produces an error.
  - If the variable value specifies multiple addresses, it can
    include addresses in the global namespace, in named
    namespaces, or a mix.

  For additional information about network namespaces, see
  [Section 7.1.14, “Network Namespace Support”](network-namespace-support.md "7.1.14 Network Namespace Support").

  If binding to any address fails, the server produces an error
  and does not start.

  Examples:

  - `bind_address=*`

    The server listens on all IPv4 or IPv6 addresses, as
    specified by the `*` wildcard.
  - `bind_address=198.51.100.20`

    The server listens only on the
    `198.51.100.20` IPv4 address.
  - `bind_address=198.51.100.20,2001:db8:0:f101::1`

    The server listens on the `198.51.100.20`
    IPv4 address and the `2001:db8:0:f101::1`
    IPv6 address.
  - `bind_address=198.51.100.20,*`

    This produces an error because wildcard addresses are not
    permitted when
    [`bind_address`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_bind_address) names a list
    of multiple values.
  - `bind_address=198.51.100.20/red,2001:db8:0:f101::1/blue,192.0.2.50`

    The server listens on the `198.51.100.20`
    IPv4 address in the `red` namespace, the
    `2001:db8:0:f101::1` IPv6 address in the
    `blue` namespace, and the
    `192.0.2.50` IPv4 address in the global
    namespace.

  When [`bind_address`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_bind_address) names a
  single value (wildcard or non-wildcard), the server listens on
  a single socket, which for a wildcard address may be bound to
  multiple network interfaces. When
  [`bind_address`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_bind_address) names a list of
  multiple values, the server listens on one socket per value,
  with each socket bound to a single network interface. The
  number of sockets is linear with the number of values
  specified. Depending on operating system connection-acceptance
  efficiency, long value lists might incur a performance penalty
  for accepting TCP/IP connections.

  Because file descriptors are allocated for listening sockets
  and network namespace files, it may be necessary to increase
  the [`open_files_limit`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_open_files_limit) system
  variable.

  If you intend to bind the server to a specific address, be
  sure that the `mysql.user` system table
  contains an account with administrative privileges that you
  can use to connect to that address. Otherwise, you cannot shut
  down the server. For example, if you bind the server to
  `*`, you can connect to it using all existing
  accounts. But if you bind the server to
  `::1`, it accepts connections only on that
  address. In that case, first make sure that the

  | [`SET_VAR`](optimizer-hints.md#optimizer-hints-set-var "Variable-Setting Hint Syntax") Hint Applies | No |
  | Type | String |
  | Default Value | `aes-128-ecb` |

  This variable controls the block encryption mode for
  block-based algorithms such as AES. It affects encryption for
  [`AES_ENCRYPT()`](encryption-functions.md#function_aes-encrypt) and
  [`AES_DECRYPT()`](encryption-functions.md#function_aes-decrypt).

  [`block_encryption_mode`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_block_encryption_mode) takes a
  value in
  `aes-keylen-mode`
  format, where *`keylen`* is the key
  length in bits and *`mode`* is the
  encryption mode. The value is not case-sensitive. Permitted
  *`keylen`* values are 128, 192, and
  256. Permitted *`mode`* values are
  `ECB`, `CBC`,
  `CFB1`, `CFB8`,
  `CFB128`, and `OFB`.

  For example, this statement causes the AES encryption
  functions to use a key length of 256 bits and the CBC mode:

  ```sql
  SET block_encryption_mode = 'aes-256-cbc';
  ```

  An error occurs for attempts to set
  [`block_encryption_mode`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_block_encryption_mode) to a
  value containing an unsupported key length or a mode that the
  SSL library does not support.
- [`build_id`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_build_id)

  | Scope | Global |
  | Dynamic | No |
  | [`SET_VAR`](optimizer-hints.md#optimizer-hints-set-var "Variable-Setting Hint Syntax") Hint Applies | No |
  | Platform Specific | Linux |

  This is a 160-bit `SHA1` signature which is
  generated by the linker when compiling the server on Linux
  systems with [`-DWITH_BUILD_ID=ON`](source-configuration-options.md#option_cmake_with_build_id)
  (enabled by default), and converted to a hexadecimal string.
  This read-only value serves as a unique build ID, and is
  written into the server log at startup.

  `build_id` is not supported on platforms
  other than Linux.

  | Maximum Value (32-bit platforms) | `4294967295` |
  | Unit | bytes/thread |

  `MyISAM` uses a special tree-like cache to
  make bulk inserts faster for
  [`INSERT ...
  SELECT`](insert-select.md "15.2.7.1 INSERT ... SELECT Statement"), `INSERT ... VALUES (...), (...),
  ...`, and [`LOAD DATA`](load-data.md "15.2.9 LOAD DATA Statement")
  when adding data to nonempty tables. This variable limits the
  size of the cache tree in bytes per thread. Setting it to 0
  disables this optimization. The default value is 8MB.

  As of MySQL 8.0.14, setting the session value of this system
  variable is a restricted operation. The session user must have
  privileges sufficient to set restricted session variables. See
  [Section 7.1.9.1, “System Variable Privileges”](system-variable-privileges.md "7.1.9.1 System Variable Privileges").

  | Maximum Value | `4095000` |

  The number of hash rounds used by the
  `caching_sha2_password` authentication plugin
  for password storage.

  Increasing the number of hashing rounds above the default
  value incurs a performance penalty that correlates with the
  amount of increase:

  - Creating an account that uses the
    `caching_sha2_password` plugin has no
    impact on the client session within which the account is
    created, but the server must perform the hashing rounds to
    complete the operation.
  - For client connections that use the account, the server
    must perform the hashing rounds and save the result in the
    cache. The result is longer login time for the first
    client connection, but not for subsequent connections.
    This behavior occurs after each server restart.

  The server uses this variable to determine whether to
  autogenerate RSA private/public key-pair files in the data
  directory if they do not already exist.

  At startup, the server automatically generates RSA
  private/public key-pair files in the data directory if all of
  these conditions are true: The
  [`sha256_password_auto_generate_rsa_keys`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_sha256_password_auto_generate_rsa_keys)
  or
  [`caching_sha2_password_auto_generate_rsa_keys`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_caching_sha2_password_auto_generate_rsa_keys)
  system variable is enabled; no RSA options are specified; the
  RSA files are missing from the data directory. These key-pair
  files enable secure password exchange using RSA over
  unencrypted connections for accounts authenticated by the
  `sha256_password` or
  `caching_sha2_password` plugin; see
  [Section 8.4.1.3, “SHA-256 Pluggable Authentication”](sha256-pluggable-authentication.md "8.4.1.3 SHA-256 Pluggable Authentication"), and
  [Section 8.4.1.2, “Caching SHA-2 Pluggable Authentication”](caching-sha2-pluggable-authentication.md "8.4.1.2 Caching SHA-2 Pluggable Authentication").

  The [`auto_generate_certs`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_auto_generate_certs)
  system variable is related but controls autogeneration of SSL
  certificate and key files needed for secure connections using
  SSL.

  This variable specifies the path name of the RSA private key
  file for the `caching_sha2_password`
  authentication plugin. If the file is named as a relative
  path, it is interpreted relative to the server data directory.
  The file must be in PEM format.

  Important

  Because this file stores a private key, its access mode
  should be restricted so that only the MySQL server can read
  it.

  For information about

  | Type | String |
  | Default Value | `utf8mb4` |

  The character set for statements that arrive from the client.
  The session value of this variable is set using the character
  set requested by the client when the client connects to the
  server. (Many clients support a
  `--default-character-set` option to enable this
  character set to be specified explicitly. See also
  [Section 12.4, “Connection Character Sets and Collations”](charset-connection.md "12.4 Connection Character Sets and Collations").) The global value of the
  variable is used to set the session value in cases when the
  client-requested value is unknown or not available, or the
  server is configured to ignore client requests:

  - The client requests a character set not known to the
    server. For example, a Japanese-enabled client requests
    `sjis` when connecting to a server not
    configured with `sjis` support.
  - The client is from a version of MySQL older than MySQL
    4.1, and thus does not request a character set.
  - [**mysqld**](mysqld.md "6.3.1 mysqld — The MySQL Server") was started with the
    [`--skip-character-set-client-handshake`](server-options.md#option_mysqld_character-set-client-handshake)
    option, which causes it to ignore client character set
    configuration.

  Some character sets cannot be used as the client character
  set. Attempting to use them as the
  [`character_set_client`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_character_set_client) value
  produces an error. See
  [Impermissible Client Character Sets](charset-connection.md#charset-connection-impermissible-client-charset "Impermissible Client Character Sets").

  The file system character set. This variable is used to
  interpret string literals that refer to file names, such as in
  the [`LOAD DATA`](load-data.md "15.2.9 LOAD DATA Statement") and
  [`SELECT ... INTO
  OUTFILE`](select-into.md "15.2.13.1 SELECT ... INTO Statement") statements and the
  [`LOAD_FILE()`](string-functions.md#function_load-file) function. Such file

  [`character_set_client`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_character_set_client) to
  [`character_set_filesystem`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_character_set_filesystem)
  before the file opening attempt occurs. The default value is
  `binary`, which means that no conversion
  occurs. For systems on which multibyte file names are
  permitted, a different value may be more appropriate. For
  example, if the system represents file names using UTF-8, set
  [`character_set_filesystem`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_character_set_filesystem) to
  `'utf8mb4'`.

  Some authentication plugins implement proxy user mapping for
  themselves (for example, the PAM and Windows authentication
  plugins). Other authentication plugins do not support proxy
  users by default. Of these, some can request that the MySQL
  server itself map proxy users according to granted proxy
  privileges: `mysql_native_password`,
  `sha256_password`.

  If the [`check_proxy_users`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_check_proxy_users)
  system variable is enabled, the server performs proxy user
  mapping for any authentication plugins that make such a
  request. However, it may also be necessary to enable
  plugin-specific system variables to take advantage of server
  proxy user mapping support:

  - For the `mysql_native_password` plugin,
    enable
    [`mysql_native_password_proxy_users`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_mysql_native_password_proxy_users).
  - For the `sha256_password` plugin, enable
    [`sha256_password_proxy_users`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_sha256_password_proxy_users).

  important for comparisons of literal strings. For comparisons
  of strings with column values,
  [`collation_connection`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_collation_connection) does not

  | [`SET_VAR`](optimizer-hints.md#optimizer-hints-set-var "Variable-Setting Hint Syntax") Hint Applies | No |
  | Type | Boolean |
  | Default Value | `ON` |

  When set to `OFF` at startup, the background
  thread does not start. Tasks can still be scheduled, but they
  do not run until `component_scheduler` is
  enabled. When set to `ON` at startup, the
  component is fully operational.

  It is also possible to set the value dynamically to get the
  following effects:

  - `ON` starts the background thread that
    begins servicing the queue immediately.
  - `OFF` signals a termination of the
    background thread, which waits for it to end. The
    background thread checks the termination flag before
    accessing the queue to check for tasks to execute.

  | Type | Enumeration |
  | Default Value | `AUTO` |
  | Valid Values | `NEVER`  `AUTO`  `ALWAYS`  `0`  `1`  `2` |

  If `AUTO` (the default), MySQL permits
  [`INSERT`](insert.md "15.2.7 INSERT Statement") and
  [`SELECT`](select.md "15.2.13 SELECT Statement") statements to run
  concurrently for `MyISAM` tables that have no
  free blocks in the middle of the data file.

  This variable can take the values shown in the following
  table. The variable can be assigned using either the name
  values or corresponding integer values.

  | Value | Description |
  | --- | --- |
  | `NEVER` (or 0) | Disables concurrent inserts |
  | `AUTO` (or 1) | (Default) Enables concurrent insert for `MyISAM` tables that do not have holes |
  | `ALWAYS` (or 2) | Enables concurrent inserts for all `MyISAM` tables, even those that have holes. For a table with a hole, new rows are inserted at the end of the table if it is in use by another thread. Otherwise, MySQL acquires a normal write lock and inserts the row into the hole. |

  If you start [**mysqld**](mysqld.md "6.3.1 mysqld — The MySQL Server") with
  [`--skip-new`](server-options.md#option_mysqld_skip-new),
  [`concurrent_insert`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_concurrent_insert) is set to
  `NEVER`.

  The number of seconds that the [**mysqld**](mysqld.md "6.3.1 mysqld — The MySQL Server")
  server waits for a connect packet before responding with
  `Bad handshake`. The default value is 10
  seconds.

  Increasing the
  [`connect_timeout`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_connect_timeout) value might
  help if clients frequently encounter errors of the form
  `Lost connection to MySQL server at
  'XXX', system error:
  errno`.

  Set the chunking size for updates to the global memory usage
  counter
  [`Global_connection_memory`](server-status-variables.md#statvar_Global_connection_memory).
  The status variable is updated only when total memory
  consumption by all user connections changes by more than this
  amount. Disable updates by setting
  `connection_memory_chunk_size = 0`.

  The memory calculation is exclusive of any memory used by
  system users such as the MySQL root user. Memory used by the
  [`InnoDB`](innodb-storage-engine.md "Chapter 17 The InnoDB Storage Engine") buffer pool is also not
  included.

  You must have the
  [`SYSTEM_VARIABLES_ADMIN`](privileges-provided.md#priv_system-variables-admin) or
  [`SUPER`](privileges-provided.md#priv_super) privilege to set this
  variable.

  Set the maximum amount of memory that can be used by a single
  user connection. If any user connection uses more than this
  amount, all queries from this connection are rejected with
  [`ER_CONN_LIMIT`](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/mysql-errors/8.0/en/server-error-reference.html#error_er_conn_limit), including any
  queries currently running.

  The limit set by this variable does not apply to system users,
  or to the MySQL root account. Memory used by the
  [`InnoDB`](innodb-storage-engine.md "Chapter 17 The InnoDB Storage Engine") buffer pool is also not
  included.

  You must have the
  [`SYSTEM_VARIABLES_ADMIN`](privileges-provided.md#priv_system-variables-admin) or

  Whether to use a dedicated listening thread for client
  connections on the administrative network interface (see
  [Section 7.1.12.1, “Connection Interfaces”](connection-interfaces.md "7.1.12.1 Connection Interfaces")). The default is
  `OFF`; that is, the manager thread for
  ordinary connections on the main interface also handles
  connections for the administrative interface.

  Depending on factors such as platform type and workload, you
  may find one setting for this variable yields better
  performance than the other setting.

  Setting
  [`create_admin_listener_thread`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_create_admin_listener_thread)
  has no effect if
  [`admin_address`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_admin_address) is not

  The path to the MySQL server data directory. Relative paths
  are resolved with respect to the current directory. If you
  expect the server to be started automatically (that is, in
  contexts for which you cannot know the current directory in
  advance), it is best to specify the
  [`datadir`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_datadir) value as an absolute

  | Type | String |
  | Default Value (Unix) | `d:t:i:o,/tmp/mysqld.trace` |
  | Default Value (Windows) | `d:t:i:O,\mysqld.trace` |

  This variable indicates the current debugging settings. It is
  available only for servers built with debugging support. The
  initial value comes from the value of instances of the
  [`--debug`](server-options.md#option_mysqld_debug) option given at server
  startup. The global and session values may be set at runtime.

  Setting the session value of this system variable is a
  restricted operation. The session user must have privileges
  sufficient to set restricted session variables. See
  [Section 7.1.9.1, “System Variable Privileges”](system-variable-privileges.md "7.1.9.1 System Variable Privileges").

  Assigning a value that begins with `+` or
  `-` cause the value to added to or subtracted
  from the current value:

  ```sql
  mysql> SET debug = 'T';
  mysql> SELECT @@debug;
  +---------+

  | [`SET_VAR`](optimizer-hints.md#optimizer-hints-set-var "Variable-Setting Hint Syntax") Hint Applies | No |
  | Type | String |

  This variable is the user interface to the Debug Sync
  facility. Use of Debug Sync requires that MySQL be configured
  with the [`-DWITH_DEBUG=ON`](source-configuration-options.md#option_cmake_with_debug)
  **CMake** option (see
  [Section 2.8.7, “MySQL Source-Configuration Options”](source-configuration-options.md "2.8.7 MySQL Source-Configuration Options")); otherwise,
  this system variable is not available.

  The global variable value is read only and indicates whether
  the facility is enabled. By default, Debug Sync is disabled
  and the value of [`debug_sync`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_debug_sync)
  is `OFF`. If the server is started with
  [`--debug-sync-timeout=N`](server-options.md#option_mysqld_debug-sync-timeout),
  where *`N`* is a timeout value greater
  than 0, Debug Sync is enabled and the value of
  [`debug_sync`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_debug_sync) is `ON -
  current signal` followed by the signal name. Also,
  *`N`* becomes the default timeout for
  individual synchronization points.

  The session value can be read by any user and has the same
  value as the global variable. The session value can be set to
  control synchronization points.

  Setting the session value of this system variable is a
  restricted operation. The session user must have privileges
  sufficient to set restricted session variables. See
  [Section 7.1.9.1, “System Variable Privileges”](system-variable-privileges.md "7.1.9.1 System Variable Privileges").

  | Valid Values | `mysql_native_password`  `sha256_password`  `caching_sha2_password` |

  The default authentication plugin. This must be a plugin that
  uses internal credentials storage, so these values are
  permitted:

  - `mysql_native_password`: Use MySQL native
    passwords; see
    [Section 8.4.1.1, “Native Pluggable Authentication”](native-pluggable-authentication.md "8.4.1.1 Native Pluggable Authentication").
  - `sha256_password`: Use SHA-256 passwords;
    see [Section 8.4.1.3, “SHA-256 Pluggable Authentication”](sha256-pluggable-authentication.md "8.4.1.3 SHA-256 Pluggable Authentication").
  - `caching_sha2_password`: Use SHA-256
    passwords; see
    [Section 8.4.1.2, “Caching SHA-2 Pluggable Authentication”](caching-sha2-pluggable-authentication.md "8.4.1.2 Caching SHA-2 Pluggable Authentication").

  For information about which authentication plugins use
  internal credentials storage, see
  [Section 8.2.15, “Password Management”](password-management.md "8.2.15 Password Management").

  Note

  In MySQL 8.0, `caching_sha2_password` is
  the default authentication plugin rather than
  `mysql_native_password`. For information
  about the implications of this change for server operation
  and compatibility of the server with clients and connectors,
  see [caching\_sha2\_password as the Preferred Authentication Plugin](upgrading-from-previous-series.md#upgrade-caching-sha2-password "caching_sha2_password as the Preferred Authentication Plugin").

  Prior to MySQL 8.0.27, the
  [`default_authentication_plugin`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_default_authentication_plugin)
  value affects these aspects of server operation:

  - It determines which authentication plugin the server
    assigns to new accounts created by
    [`CREATE USER`](create-user.md "15.7.1.3 CREATE USER Statement") statements that
    do not explicitly specify an authentication plugin.
  - For an account created with a statement of the following
    form, the server associates the account with the default
    authentication plugin and assigns the account the given
    password, hashed as required by that plugin:

    ```sql
    CREATE USER ... IDENTIFIED BY 'cleartext password';
    ```

  As of MySQL 8.0.27, which introduces multifactor
  authentication,
  [`default_authentication_plugin`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_default_authentication_plugin)
  is still used, but in conjunction with and at a lower
  precedence than the
  [`authentication_policy`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_authentication_policy) system
  variable. For details, see
  [The Default Authentication Plugin](pluggable-authentication.md#pluggable-authentication-default-plugin "The Default Authentication Plugin").
  Because of this diminished role,
  [`default_authentication_plugin`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_default_authentication_plugin)
  is deprecated as of MySQL 8.0.27 and subject to removal in a
  future MySQL version.
- [`default_collation_for_utf8mb4`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_default_collation_for_utf8mb4)

  | Default Value | `utf8mb4_0900_ai_ci` |
  | Valid Values | `utf8mb4_0900_ai_ci`  `utf8mb4_general_ci` |

  Important

  The `default_collation_for_utf8mb4` system
  variable is for internal use by MySQL Replication only.

  This variable is set by the server to the default collation
  for the `utf8mb4` character set. The value of
  the variable is replicated from a source to a replica so that
  the replica can correctly process data originating from a
  source with a different default collation for
  `utf8mb4`. This variable is primarily
  intended to support replication from a MySQL 5.7 or older
  replication source server to a MySQL 8.0 replica server, or
  group replication with a MySQL 5.7 primary node and one or
  more MySQL 8.0 secondaries. The default collation for
  `utf8mb4` in MySQL 5.7 is
  `utf8mb4_general_ci`, but
  `utf8mb4_0900_ai_ci` in MySQL 8.0. The
  variable is not present in releases earlier than MySQL 8.0, so
  if the replica does not receive a value for the variable, it
  assumes the source is from an earlier release and sets the
  value to the previous default collation
  `utf8mb4_general_ci`.

  As of MySQL 8.0.18, setting the session value of this system
  variable is no longer a restricted operation.

  The default `utf8mb4` collation is used in
  the following statements:

  - [`SHOW COLLATION`](show-collation.md "15.7.7.4 SHOW COLLATION Statement") and
    [`SHOW CHARACTER SET`](show-character-set.md "15.7.7.3 SHOW CHARACTER SET Statement").
  - [`CREATE TABLE`](create-table.md "15.1.20 CREATE TABLE Statement") and
    [`ALTER TABLE`](alter-table.md "15.1.9 ALTER TABLE Statement") having a
    `CHARACTER SET utf8mb4` clause without a
    `COLLATION` clause, either for the table
    character set or for a column character set.
  - [`CREATE DATABASE`](create-database.md "15.1.12 CREATE DATABASE Statement") and
    [`ALTER DATABASE`](alter-database.md "15.1.2 ALTER DATABASE Statement") having a
    `CHARACTER SET utf8mb4` clause without a
    `COLLATION` clause.
  - Any statement containing a string literal of the form
    `_utf8mb4'some
    text'` without a
    `COLLATE` clause.

  | Type | Integer |
  | Default Value | `0` |
  | Minimum Value | `0` |
  | Maximum Value | `65535` |
  | Unit | days |

  This variable defines the global automatic password expiration
  policy. The default
  [`default_password_lifetime`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_default_password_lifetime)
  value is 0, which disables automatic password expiration. If
  the value of
  [`default_password_lifetime`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_default_password_lifetime) is
  a positive integer *`N`*, it indicates
  the permitted password lifetime; passwords must be changed
  every *`N`* days.

  The global password expiration policy can be overridden as
  desired for individual accounts using the password expiration
  option of the [`CREATE USER`](create-user.md "15.7.1.3 CREATE USER Statement") and
  [`ALTER USER`](alter-user.md "15.7.1.1 ALTER USER Statement") statements. See

  The default storage engine for tables. See
  [Chapter 18, *Alternative Storage Engines*](storage-engines.md "Chapter 18 Alternative Storage Engines"). This variable sets the
  storage engine for permanent tables only. To set the storage
  engine for `TEMPORARY` tables, set the
  [`default_tmp_storage_engine`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_default_tmp_storage_engine)
  system variable.

  To see which storage engines are available and enabled, use
  the [`SHOW ENGINES`](show-engines.md "15.7.7.16 SHOW ENGINES Statement") statement or
  query the `INFORMATION_SCHEMA`
  [`ENGINES`](information-schema-engines-table.md "28.3.13 The INFORMATION_SCHEMA ENGINES Table") table.

  If you disable the default storage engine at server startup,
  you must set the default engine for both permanent and
  `TEMPORARY` tables to a different engine, or
  else the server does not start.

  Defines the default encryption setting applied to schemas and
  general tablespaces when they are created without specifying
  an `ENCRYPTION` clause.

  The [`default_table_encryption`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_default_table_encryption)
  variable is only applicable to user-created schemas and
  general tablespaces. It does not govern encryption of the
  `mysql` system tablespace.

  Setting the runtime value of
  [`default_table_encryption`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_default_table_encryption)
  requires the
  [`SYSTEM_VARIABLES_ADMIN`](privileges-provided.md#priv_system-variables-admin) and
  [`TABLE_ENCRYPTION_ADMIN`](privileges-provided.md#priv_table-encryption-admin)
  privileges, or the deprecated
  [`SUPER`](privileges-provided.md#priv_super) privilege.

  The value of
  [`default_table_encryption`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_default_table_encryption)
  cannot be changed while Group Replication is running.

  [`default_table_encryption`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_default_table_encryption)
  supports [`SET
  PERSIST`](set-variable.md "15.7.6.1 SET Syntax for Variable Assignment") and
  [`SET

  | Scope | Global |

  | [`SET_VAR`](optimizer-hints.md#optimizer-hints-set-var "Variable-Setting Hint Syntax") Hint Applies | No |
  | Type | Enumeration |
  | Default Value | `ON` |
  | Valid Values | `OFF`  `ON`  `ALL` |

  This variable specifies how to use delayed key writes. It
  applies only to `MyISAM` tables. Delayed key
  writing causes key buffers not to be flushed between writes.
  See also [Section 18.2.1, “MyISAM Startup Options”](myisam-start.md "18.2.1 MyISAM Startup Options").

  This variable can have one of the following values to affect
  handling of the `DELAY_KEY_WRITE` table
  option that can be used in [`CREATE
  TABLE`](create-table.md "15.1.20 CREATE TABLE Statement") statements.

  | Option | Description |
  | --- | --- |
  | `OFF` | `DELAY_KEY_WRITE` is ignored. |
  | `ON` | MySQL honors any `DELAY_KEY_WRITE` option specified in [`CREATE TABLE`](create-table.md "15.1.20 CREATE TABLE Statement") statements. This is the default value. |
  | `ALL` | All new opened tables are treated as if they were created with the `DELAY_KEY_WRITE` option enabled. |

  Note

  If you set this variable to `ALL`, you
  should not use `MyISAM` tables from within
  another program (such as another MySQL server or
  [**myisamchk**](myisamchk.md "6.6.4 myisamchk — MyISAM Table-Maintenance Utility")) when the tables are in use.
  Doing so leads to index corruption.

  If `DELAY_KEY_WRITE` is enabled for a table,
  the key buffer is not flushed for the table on every index
  update, but only when the table is closed. This speeds up
  writes on keys a lot, but if you use this feature, you should
  add automatic checking of all `MyISAM` tables
  by starting the server with the
  [`myisam_recover_options`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_myisam_recover_options) system
  variable set (for example,
  `myisam_recover_options='BACKUP,FORCE'`).
  See [Section 7.1.8, “Server System Variables”](server-system-variables.md "7.1.8 Server System Variables"), and
  [Section 18.2.1, “MyISAM Startup Options”](myisam-start.md "18.2.1 MyISAM Startup Options").

  If you start [**mysqld**](mysqld.md "6.3.1 mysqld — The MySQL Server") with
  [`--skip-new`](server-options.md#option_mysqld_skip-new),
  [`delay_key_write`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_delay_key_write) is set to
  `OFF`.

  Warning

  If you enable external locking with
  [`--external-locking`](server-options.md#option_mysqld_external-locking), there is
  no protection against index corruption for tables that use
  delayed key writes.

  | [`SET_VAR`](optimizer-hints.md#optimizer-hints-set-var "Variable-Setting Hint Syntax") Hint Applies | No |
  | Type | String |
  | Default Value | `empty string` |

  This variable indicates which storage engines cannot be used
  to create tables or tablespaces. For example, to prevent new
  `MyISAM` or `FEDERATED`
  tables from being created, start the server with these lines
  in the server option file:

  ```ini
  [mysqld]
  disabled_storage_engines="MyISAM,FEDERATED"
  ```

  By default,
  [`disabled_storage_engines`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_disabled_storage_engines) is
  empty (no engines disabled), but it can be set to a
  comma-separated list of one or more engines (not
  case-sensitive). Any engine named in the value cannot be used
  to create tables or tablespaces with
  [`CREATE TABLE`](create-table.md "15.1.20 CREATE TABLE Statement") or
  [`CREATE TABLESPACE`](create-tablespace.md "15.1.21 CREATE TABLESPACE Statement"), and cannot
  be used with
  [`ALTER TABLE ...
  ENGINE`](alter-table.md "15.1.9 ALTER TABLE Statement") or
  [`ALTER
  TABLESPACE ... ENGINE`](alter-tablespace.md "15.1.10 ALTER TABLESPACE Statement") to change the storage engine
  of existing tables or tablespaces. Attempts to do so result in
  an [`ER_DISABLED_STORAGE_ENGINE`](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/mysql-errors/8.0/en/server-error-reference.html#error_er_disabled_storage_engine)
  error.

  [`disabled_storage_engines`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_disabled_storage_engines) does
  not restrict other DDL statements for existing tables, such as
  [`CREATE INDEX`](create-index.md "15.1.15 CREATE INDEX Statement"),
  [`TRUNCATE TABLE`](truncate-table.md "15.1.37 TRUNCATE TABLE Statement"),
  [`ANALYZE TABLE`](analyze-table.md "15.7.3.1 ANALYZE TABLE Statement"),
  [`DROP TABLE`](drop-table.md "15.1.32 DROP TABLE Statement"), or
  [`DROP TABLESPACE`](drop-tablespace.md "15.1.33 DROP TABLESPACE Statement"). This permits a
  smooth transition so that existing tables or tablespaces that
  use a disabled engine can be migrated to a permitted engine by
  means such as
  [`ALTER TABLE ...
  ENGINE permitted_engine`](alter-table.md "15.1.9 ALTER TABLE Statement").

  It is permitted to set the
  [`default_storage_engine`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_default_storage_engine) or
  [`default_tmp_storage_engine`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_default_tmp_storage_engine)
  system variable to a storage engine that is disabled. This
  could cause applications to behave erratically or fail,
  although that might be a useful technique in a development
  environment for identifying applications that use disabled
  engines, so that they can be modified.

  [`disabled_storage_engines`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_disabled_storage_engines) is
  disabled and has no effect if the server is started with any
  of these options: [`--initialize`](server-options.md#option_mysqld_initialize),
  [`--initialize-insecure`](server-options.md#option_mysqld_initialize-insecure),
  [`--skip-grant-tables`](server-options.md#option_mysqld_skip-grant-tables).

  Note

  Setting
  [`disabled_storage_engines`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_disabled_storage_engines)
  might cause an issue with [**mysql\_upgrade**](mysql-upgrade.md "6.4.5 mysql_upgrade — Check and Upgrade MySQL Tables").
  For details, see [Section 6.4.5, “mysql\_upgrade — Check and Upgrade MySQL Tables”](mysql-upgrade.md "6.4.5 mysql_upgrade — Check and Upgrade MySQL Tables").

  | [`SET_VAR`](optimizer-hints.md#optimizer-hints-set-var "Variable-Setting Hint Syntax") Hint Applies | No |
  | Type | Boolean |
  | Default Value | `ON` |

  This variable controls how the server handles clients with
  expired passwords:

  - If the client indicates that it can handle expired
    passwords, the value of
    [`disconnect_on_expired_password`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_disconnect_on_expired_password)
    is irrelevant. The server permits the client to connect
    but puts it in sandbox mode.
  - If the client does not indicate that it can handle expired
    passwords, the server handles the client according to the
    value of
    [`disconnect_on_expired_password`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_disconnect_on_expired_password):

    - If
      [`disconnect_on_expired_password`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_disconnect_on_expired_password):
      is enabled, the server disconnects the client.
    - If
      [`disconnect_on_expired_password`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_disconnect_on_expired_password):
      is disabled, the server permits the client to connect
      but puts it in sandbox mode.

  For more information about the interaction of client and
  server settings relating to expired-password handling, see
  [Section 8.2.16, “Server Handling of Expired Passwords”](expired-password-handling.md "8.2.16 Server Handling of Expired Passwords").

  performed with the
  [`/`](arithmetic-functions.md#operator_divide) operator.
  The default value is 4. The minimum and maximum values are 0

  | Type | String |
  | Default Value | `IF prio>=INFORMATION THEN drop. IF EXISTS source_line THEN unset source_line.` |

  The filter rules that control operation of the
  `log_filter_dragnet` error log filter
  component. If `log_filter_dragnet` is not
  installed,
  [`dragnet.log_error_filter_rules`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_dragnet.log_error_filter_rules)
  is unavailable. If `log_filter_dragnet` is
  installed but not enabled, changes to
  [`dragnet.log_error_filter_rules`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_dragnet.log_error_filter_rules)
  have no effect.

  The effect of the default value is similar to the filtering
  performed by the `log_sink_internal` filter
  with a setting of
  [`log_error_verbosity=2`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_log_error_verbosity).

  As of MySQL 8.0.12, the
  [`dragnet.Status`](server-status-variables.md#statvar_dragnet.Status) status
  variable can be consulted to determine the result of the most
  recent assignment to
  [`dragnet.log_error_filter_rules`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_dragnet.log_error_filter_rules).

  Prior to MySQL 8.0.12, successful assignments to
  [`dragnet.log_error_filter_rules`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_dragnet.log_error_filter_rules)
  at runtime produce a note confirming the new value:

  ```sql
  mysql> SET GLOBAL dragnet.log_error_filter_rules = 'IF prio <> 0 THEN unset prio.';
  Query OK, 0 rows affected, 1 warning (0.00 sec)

  mysql> SHOW WARNINGS\G
  *************************** 1. row ***************************
    Level: Note
     Code: 4569
  Message: filter configuration accepted:
           SET @@GLOBAL.dragnet.log_error_filter_rules=
           'IF prio!=ERROR THEN unset prio.';
  ```

  The value displayed by [`SHOW
  WARNINGS`](show-warnings.md "15.7.7.42 SHOW WARNINGS Statement") indicates the “decompiled”
  canonical representation after the rule set has been
  successfully parsed and compiled into internal form.
  Semantically, this canonical form is identical to the value
  assigned to
  [`dragnet.log_error_filter_rules`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_dragnet.log_error_filter_rules),
  but there may be some differences between the assigned and
  canonical values, as illustrated by the preceding example:

  - The `<>` operator is changed to
    `!=`.
  - The numeric priority of 0 is changed to the corresponding
    priority symbol `ERROR`.
  - Optional spaces are removed.

  | Type | Integer |
  | Default Value | `4096` |
  | Minimum Value | `2048` |
  | Maximum Value | `16384` |

  This variable limits the maximum size of RSA keys generated by
  MySQL Enterprise Encryption. The variable is available only if
  the MySQL Enterprise Encryption component
  `component_enterprise_encryption` is
  installed, which is available from MySQL 8.0.30. The variable
  is not available if the `openssl_udf` shared
  library is used to provide MySQL Enterprise Encryption
  functions.

  The lowest setting is 2048 bits, which is the minimum RSA key
  length that is acceptable by current best practice. The
  default setting is 4096 bits. The highest setting is 16384
  bits. Generating longer keys can consume significant CPU
  resources, so you can use this setting to limit keys to a
  length that provides adequate security for your requirements
  while balancing this with resource usage. Note that the
  functions provided by the `openssl_udf`
  shared library allow key lengths starting at 1024 bits, and
  following an upgrade to the component, the minimum key length
  is greater than this. See
  [Section 8.6.2, “Configuring MySQL Enterprise Encryption”](enterprise-encryption-configuring.md "8.6.2 Configuring MySQL Enterprise Encryption") for more
  information.

  | Dynamic | Yes |
  | [`SET_VAR`](optimizer-hints.md#optimizer-hints-set-var "Variable-Setting Hint Syntax") Hint Applies | No |
  | Type | Boolean |
  | Default Value | `OFF` |

  This variable controls whether encrypted data and signatures
  that MySQL Enterprise Encryption produced with the
  `openssl_udf` shared library functions used
  before MySQL 8.0.30, can be decrypted or verified by the
  functions of the MySQL Enterprise Encryption component
  `component_enterprise_encryption`, which is
  available from MySQL 8.0.30. The variable is available only if
  the MySQL Enterprise Encryption component is installed, and it
  is not available if the `openssl_udf` shared
  library is used to provide MySQL Enterprise Encryption
  functions.

  For the component functions to support decryption and
  verification for content produced by the legacy
  `openssl_udf` shared library functions, you
  must set the system variable padding to `ON`.
  When `ON` is set, if the component functions
  cannot decrypt or verify content when assuming it has the
  RSAES-OAEP or RSASSA-PSS scheme (as used by the component),
  they make another attempt assuming it has the RSAES-PKCS1-v1\_5
  or RSASSA-PKCS1-v1\_5 scheme (as used by the
  `openssl_udf` shared library functions). When
  `OFF` is set, if the component functions
  cannot decrypt or verify content using their normal schemes,
  they return null output. See
  [Section 8.6.2, “Configuring MySQL Enterprise Encryption”](enterprise-encryption-configuring.md "8.6.2 Configuring MySQL Enterprise Encryption") for more

  | Type | Integer |
  | Default Value | `200` |
  | Minimum Value | `0` |
  | Maximum Value | `4294967295` |

  This variable indicates the number of equality ranges in an
  equality comparison condition when the optimizer should switch
  from using index dives to index statistics in estimating the
  number of qualifying rows. It applies to evaluation of
  expressions that have either of these equivalent forms, where
  the optimizer uses a nonunique index to look up
  *`col_name`* values:

  ```sql
  col_name IN(val1, ..., valN)
  col_name = val1 OR ... OR col_name = valN
  ```

  In both cases, the expression contains
  *`N`* equality ranges. The optimizer
  can make row estimates using index dives or index statistics.
  If [`eq_range_index_dive_limit`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_eq_range_index_dive_limit)
  is greater than 0, the optimizer uses existing index
  statistics instead of index dives if there are
  [`eq_range_index_dive_limit`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_eq_range_index_dive_limit) or
  more equality ranges. Thus, to permit use of index dives for
  up to *`N`* equality ranges, set
  [`eq_range_index_dive_limit`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_eq_range_index_dive_limit) to
  *`N`* + 1. To disable use of index
  statistics and always use index dives regardless of
  *`N`*, set
  [`eq_range_index_dive_limit`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_eq_range_index_dive_limit) to
  0.

  For more information, see
  [Equality Range Optimization of Many-Valued Comparisons](range-optimization.md#equality-range-optimization "Equality Range Optimization of Many-Valued Comparisons").

  This variable enables or disables, and starts or stops, the
  Event Scheduler. The possible status values are
  `ON`, `OFF`, and
  `DISABLED`. Turning the Event Scheduler
  `OFF` is not the same as disabling the Event
  Scheduler, which requires setting the status to
  `DISABLED`. This variable and its effects on

  | Type | Enumeration |
  | Default Value | `TRADITIONAL` |
  | Valid Values | `TRADITIONAL`  `JSON`  `TREE` |

  This variable determines the default output format used by
  [`EXPLAIN`](explain.md#explain-execution-plan "Obtaining Execution Plan Information")
  in the absence of a `FORMAT` option when
  displaying a query execution plan. Possible values and their
  effects are listed here:

  - `TRADITIONAL`: Use MySQL's
    traditional table-based output, as if
    `FORMAT=TRADITIONAL` had been specified
    as part of the `EXPLAIN` statement. This
    is the variable's default value.
    `DEFAULT` is also supported as a synonym
    for `TRADITIONAL`, and has exactly the
    same effect.

    Note

    `DEFAULT` cannot be used as part of an
    `EXPLAIN` statement's
    `FORMAT` option.
  - `JSON`: Use the JSON output format, as if
    `FORMAT=JSON` had been specified.
  - `TREE`: Use the tree-based output format,
    as if `FORMAT=TREE` had been specified.

  The setting for this variable also affects `EXPLAIN
  ANALYZE`. For this purpose,
  `DEFAULT` and `TRADITIONAL`
  are interpeted as `TREE`. If the value of
  `explain_format` is `JSON`
  and an `EXPLAIN ANALYZE` statement having no
  `FORMAT` option is issued, the statement
  raises an error
  ([`ER_NOT_SUPPORTED_YET`](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/mysql-errors/8.0/en/server-error-reference.html#error_er_not_supported_yet)).

  Using a format specifier with `EXPLAIN` or
  `EXPLAIN ANALYZE` overrides any setting for
  `explain_format`.

  The `explain_format` system variable has no
  effect on `EXPLAIN` output when this
  statement is used to display information about table columns.

  Setting the session value of `explain_format`

  requires [`SYSTEM_VARIABLES_ADMIN`](privileges-provided.md#priv_system-variables-admin)
  (or the deprecated [`SUPER`](privileges-provided.md#priv_super)

  This system variable determines whether the server enables
  certain nonstandard behaviors for default values and
  `NULL`-value handling in
  [`TIMESTAMP`](datetime.md "13.2.2 The DATE, DATETIME, and TIMESTAMP Types") columns. By default,
  [`explicit_defaults_for_timestamp`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_explicit_defaults_for_timestamp)
  is enabled, which disables the nonstandard behaviors.
  Disabling
  [`explicit_defaults_for_timestamp`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_explicit_defaults_for_timestamp)
  results in a warning.

  As of MySQL 8.0.18, setting the session value of this system
  variable is no longer a restricted operation.

  If
  [`explicit_defaults_for_timestamp`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_explicit_defaults_for_timestamp)
  is disabled, the server enables the nonstandard behaviors and
  handles [`TIMESTAMP`](datetime.md "13.2.2 The DATE, DATETIME, and TIMESTAMP Types") columns as
  follows:

  - [`TIMESTAMP`](datetime.md "13.2.2 The DATE, DATETIME, and TIMESTAMP Types") columns not
    explicitly declared with the `NULL`
    attribute are automatically declared with the `NOT
    NULL` attribute. Assigning such a column a value
    of `NULL` is permitted and sets the
    column to the current timestamp.
    *Exception*: As of MySQL 8.0.22,
    attempting to insert `NULL` into a
    generated column declared as `TIMESTAMP NOT
    NULL` is rejected with an error.
  - The first [`TIMESTAMP`](datetime.md "13.2.2 The DATE, DATETIME, and TIMESTAMP Types") column
    in a table, if not explicitly declared with the
    `NULL` attribute or an explicit
    `DEFAULT` or `ON UPDATE`
    attribute, is automatically declared with the
    `DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP` and
    `ON UPDATE CURRENT_TIMESTAMP` attributes.
  - [`TIMESTAMP`](datetime.md "13.2.2 The DATE, DATETIME, and TIMESTAMP Types") columns following
    the first one, if not explicitly declared with the
    `NULL` attribute or an explicit
    `DEFAULT` attribute, are automatically
    declared as `DEFAULT '0000-00-00
    00:00:00'` (the “zero” timestamp).
    For inserted rows that specify no explicit value for such
    a column, the column is assigned `'0000-00-00
    00:00:00'` and no warning occurs.

    Depending on whether strict SQL mode or the
    [`NO_ZERO_DATE`](sql-mode.md#sqlmode_no_zero_date) SQL mode is
    enabled, a default value of `'0000-00-00
    00:00:00'` may be invalid. Be aware that the
    [`TRADITIONAL`](sql-mode.md#sqlmode_traditional) SQL mode
    includes strict mode and
    [`NO_ZERO_DATE`](sql-mode.md#sqlmode_no_zero_date). See
    [Section 7.1.11, “Server SQL Modes”](sql-mode.md "7.1.11 Server SQL Modes").

  The nonstandard behaviors just described are deprecated;
  expect them to be removed in a future MySQL release.

  If
  [`explicit_defaults_for_timestamp`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_explicit_defaults_for_timestamp)
  is enabled, the server disables the nonstandard behaviors and
  handles [`TIMESTAMP`](datetime.md "13.2.2 The DATE, DATETIME, and TIMESTAMP Types") columns as
  follows:

  - It is not possible to assign a
    [`TIMESTAMP`](datetime.md "13.2.2 The DATE, DATETIME, and TIMESTAMP Types") column a value of
    `NULL` to set it to the current
    timestamp. To assign the current timestamp, set the column
    to [`CURRENT_TIMESTAMP`](date-and-time-functions.md#function_current-timestamp) or a
    synonym such as [`NOW()`](date-and-time-functions.md#function_now).
  - [`TIMESTAMP`](datetime.md "13.2.2 The DATE, DATETIME, and TIMESTAMP Types") columns not
    explicitly declared with the `NOT NULL`
    attribute are automatically declared with the
    `NULL` attribute and permit
    `NULL` values. Assigning such a column a
    value of `NULL` sets it to
    `NULL`, not the current timestamp.
  - [`TIMESTAMP`](datetime.md "13.2.2 The DATE, DATETIME, and TIMESTAMP Types") columns declared
    with the `NOT NULL` attribute do not
    permit `NULL` values. For inserts that
    specify `NULL` for such a column, the
    result is either an error for a single-row insert if
    strict SQL mode is enabled, or `'0000-00-00
    00:00:00'` is inserted for multiple-row inserts
    with strict SQL mode disabled. In no case does assigning
    the column a value of `NULL` set it to
    the current timestamp.
  - [`TIMESTAMP`](datetime.md "13.2.2 The DATE, DATETIME, and TIMESTAMP Types") columns
    explicitly declared with the `NOT NULL`
    attribute and without an explicit
    `DEFAULT` attribute are treated as having
    no default value. For inserted rows that specify no
    explicit value for such a column, the result depends on
    the SQL mode. If strict SQL mode is enabled, an error
    occurs. If strict SQL mode is not enabled, the column is
    declared with the implicit default of `'0000-00-00
    00:00:00'` and a warning occurs. This is similar
    to how MySQL treats other temporal types such as
    [`DATETIME`](datetime.md "13.2.2 The DATE, DATETIME, and TIMESTAMP Types").
  - No [`TIMESTAMP`](datetime.md "13.2.2 The DATE, DATETIME, and TIMESTAMP Types") column is
    automatically declared with the `DEFAULT
    CURRENT_TIMESTAMP` or `ON UPDATE
    CURRENT_TIMESTAMP` attributes. Those attributes
    must be explicitly specified.
  - The first [`TIMESTAMP`](datetime.md "13.2.2 The DATE, DATETIME, and TIMESTAMP Types") column
    in a table is not handled differently from
    [`TIMESTAMP`](datetime.md "13.2.2 The DATE, DATETIME, and TIMESTAMP Types") columns following
    the first one.

  If
  [`explicit_defaults_for_timestamp`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_explicit_defaults_for_timestamp)
  is disabled at server startup, this warning appears in the
  error log:

  ```simple
  [Warning] TIMESTAMP with implicit DEFAULT value is deprecated.
  Please use --explicit_defaults_for_timestamp server option (see
  documentation for more details).
  ```

  As indicated by the warning, to disable the deprecated
  nonstandard behaviors, enable the
  [`explicit_defaults_for_timestamp`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_explicit_defaults_for_timestamp)
  system variable at server startup.

  Note

  [`explicit_defaults_for_timestamp`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_explicit_defaults_for_timestamp)
  is itself deprecated because its only purpose is to permit
  control over deprecated
  [`TIMESTAMP`](datetime.md "13.2.2 The DATE, DATETIME, and TIMESTAMP Types") behaviors that are
  to be removed in a future MySQL release. When removal of
  those behaviors occurs, expect
  [`explicit_defaults_for_timestamp`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_explicit_defaults_for_timestamp)
  to be removed as well.

  For additional information, see
  [Section 13.2.5, “Automatic Initialization and Updating for TIMESTAMP and DATETIME”](timestamp-initialization.md "13.2.5 Automatic Initialization and Updating for TIMESTAMP and DATETIME").

  | Scope | Session |
  | Dynamic | No |
  | [`SET_VAR`](optimizer-hints.md#optimizer-hints-set-var "Variable-Setting Hint Syntax") Hint Applies | No |
  | Type | String |

  The external user name used during the authentication process,
  as set by the plugin used to authenticate the client. With
  native (built-in) MySQL authentication, or if the plugin does
  not set the value, this variable is `NULL`.
  See [Section 8.2.19, “Proxy Users”](proxy-users.md "8.2.19 Proxy Users").
- [`flush`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_flush)

  |  |  |
  | --- | --- |
  | Command-Line Format | `--flush[={OFF|ON}]` |
  | System Variable | `flush` |
  | Scope | Global |
  | Dynamic | Yes |
  | [`SET_VAR`](optimizer-hints.md#optimizer-hints-set-var "Variable-Setting Hint Syntax") Hint Applies | No |
  | Type | Boolean |
  | Default Value | `OFF` |

  Applies to MyISAM, only.

  If `ON`, the server flushes (synchronizes)
  all changes to disk after each SQL statement. Normally, MySQL
  does a write of all changes to disk only after each SQL
  statement and lets the operating system handle the
  synchronizing to disk. See [Section B.3.3.3, “What to Do If MySQL Keeps Crashing”](crashing.md "B.3.3.3 What to Do If MySQL Keeps Crashing"). This
  variable is set to `ON` if you start
  [**mysqld**](mysqld.md "6.3.1 mysqld — The MySQL Server") with the
  [`--flush`](server-options.md#option_mysqld_flush) option.

  Note

  If [`flush`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_flush) is enabled, the
  value of [`flush_time`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_flush_time) does
  not matter and changes to
  [`flush_time`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_flush_time) have no effect
  on flush behavior.
- [`flush_time`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_flush_time)

  |  |  |
  | --- | --- |
  | Command-Line Format | `--flush-time=#` |
  | System Variable | `flush_time` |
  | Scope | Global |
  | Dynamic | Yes |
  | [`SET_VAR`](optimizer-hints.md#optimizer-hints-set-var "Variable-Setting Hint Syntax") Hint Applies | No |
  | Type | Integer |
  | Default Value | `0` |
  | Minimum Value | `0` |
  | Maximum Value | `31536000` |
  | Unit | seconds |

  If this is set to a nonzero value, all tables are closed every
  [`flush_time`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_flush_time) seconds to free up
  resources and synchronize unflushed data to disk. This option
  is best used only on systems with minimal resources.

  Note

  If [`flush`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_flush) is enabled, the
  value of [`flush_time`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_flush_time) does
  not matter and changes to
  [`flush_time`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_flush_time) have no effect
  on flush behavior.
- [`foreign_key_checks`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_foreign_key_checks)

  |  |  |
  | --- | --- |
  | System Variable | `foreign_key_checks` |
  | Scope | Global, Session |
  | Dynamic | Yes |
  | [`SET_VAR`](optimizer-hints.md#optimizer-hints-set-var "Variable-Setting Hint Syntax") Hint Applies | Yes |
  | Type | Boolean |
  | Default Value | `ON` |

  If set to 1 (the default), foreign key constraints are
  checked. If set to 0, foreign key constraints are ignored,
  with a couple of exceptions. When re-creating a table that was
  dropped, an error is returned if the table definition does not
  conform to the foreign key constraints referencing the table.
  Likewise, an [`ALTER TABLE`](alter-table.md "15.1.9 ALTER TABLE Statement")
  operation returns an error if a foreign key definition is
  incorrectly formed. For more information, see
  [Section 15.1.20.5, “FOREIGN KEY Constraints”](create-table-foreign-keys.md "15.1.20.5 FOREIGN KEY Constraints").

  Setting this variable has the same effect on
  [`NDB`](mysql-cluster.md "Chapter 25 MySQL NDB Cluster 8.0") tables as it does for
  `InnoDB` tables. Typically you leave this
  setting enabled during normal operation, to enforce
  [referential
  integrity](glossary.md#glos_referential_integrity "referential integrity"). Disabling foreign key checking can be useful
  for reloading `InnoDB` tables in an order
  different from that required by their parent/child
  relationships. See
  [Section 15.1.20.5, “FOREIGN KEY Constraints”](create-table-foreign-keys.md "15.1.20.5 FOREIGN KEY Constraints").

  Setting `foreign_key_checks` to 0 also
  affects data definition statements:
  [`DROP
  SCHEMA`](drop-database.md "15.1.24 DROP DATABASE Statement") drops a schema even if it contains tables
  that have foreign keys that are referred to by tables outside
  the schema, and [`DROP TABLE`](drop-table.md "15.1.32 DROP TABLE Statement")
  drops tables that have foreign keys that are referred to by
  other tables.

  Note

  Setting `foreign_key_checks` to 1 does not
  trigger a scan of the existing table data. Therefore, rows
  added to the table while
  [`foreign_key_checks = 0`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_foreign_key_checks) are
  not verified for consistency.

  Dropping an index required by a foreign key constraint is
  not permitted, even with
  [`foreign_key_checks=0`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_foreign_key_checks). The
  foreign key constraint must be removed before dropping the
  index.

  The default variable value is
  `'+ -><()~*:""&|'`. The rules
  for changing the value are as follows:

  - Operator function is determined by position within the
    string.
  - The replacement value must be 14 characters.
  - Each character must be an ASCII nonalphanumeric character.
  - Either the first or second character must be a space.
  - No duplicates are permitted except the phrase quoting
    operators in positions 11 and 12. These two characters are
    not required to be the same, but they are the only two
    that may be.
  - Positions 10, 13, and 14 (which by default are set to
    `:`, `&`, and
    `|`) are reserved for future extensions.

  | Type | File name |

  The file from which to read the list of stopwords for
  full-text searches on `MyISAM` tables. The
  server looks for the file in the data directory unless an
  absolute path name is given to specify a different directory.
  All the words from the file are used; comments are
  *not* honored. By default, a built-in list
  of stopwords is used (as defined in the
  `storage/myisam/ft_static.c` file). Setting
  this variable to the empty string (`''`)
  disables stopword filtering. See also
  [Section 14.9.4, “Full-Text Stopwords”](fulltext-stopwords.md "14.9.4 Full-Text Stopwords").

  Note

  `FULLTEXT` indexes on
  `MyISAM` tables must be rebuilt after
  changing this variable or the contents of the stopword file.

  [`Global_connection_memory`](server-status-variables.md#statvar_Global_connection_memory)
  should not exceed this amount. Any time that it does, all

  Memory used by the system users such as the MySQL root user is
  included in this total, but is not counted towards the
  disconnection limit; such users are never disconnected due to
  memory usage.

  Memory used by the [`InnoDB`](innodb-storage-engine.md "Chapter 17 The InnoDB Storage Engine") buffer
  pool is excluded from the total.

  You must have the

  The maximum permitted result length in bytes for the
  [`GROUP_CONCAT()`](aggregate-functions.md#function_group-concat) function. The
  default is 1024.

  Important

  When setting the value for
  [`group_concat_max_len`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_group_concat_max_len),
  consider the following:

  - Estimate the maximum length required for
    [`GROUP_CONCAT()`](aggregate-functions.md#function_group-concat) output and
    set the value accordingly.
  - Setting the value excessively high can negatively affect
    performance and lead to out-of-memory (OOM) errors.
  - In MySQL HeatWave, the maximum column length is 4 MB, so
    setting a value higher than this causes the output to be
    truncated. To avoid this, set a value under 4 MB.
- [`have_compress`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_have_compress)

  `YES` if the `zlib`
  compression library is available to the server,
  `NO` if not. If not, the
  [`COMPRESS()`](encryption-functions.md#function_compress) and
  [`UNCOMPRESS()`](encryption-functions.md#function_uncompress) functions cannot
  be used.
- [`have_dynamic_loading`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_have_dynamic_loading)

  `YES` if [**mysqld**](mysqld.md "6.3.1 mysqld — The MySQL Server") supports
  dynamic loading of plugins, `NO` if not. If
  the value is `NO`, you cannot use options
  such as `--plugin-load` to load

- [`have_geometry`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_have_geometry)

  `YES` if the server supports spatial data
  types, `NO` if not.
- [`have_openssl`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_have_openssl)

  This variable is a synonym for
  [`have_ssl`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_have_ssl).

  As of MySQL 8.0.26,
  [`have_openssl`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_have_openssl) is deprecated
  and subject to removal in a future MySQL version. For
  information about TLS properties of MySQL connection
  interfaces, use the

- [`have_profiling`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_have_profiling)

  `YES` if statement profiling capability is
  present, `NO` if not. If present, the
  `profiling` system variable controls whether
  this capability is enabled or disabled. See
  [Section 15.7.7.31, “SHOW PROFILES Statement”](show-profiles.md "15.7.7.31 SHOW PROFILES Statement").

  This variable is deprecated and you should expect it to be
  removed in a future MySQL release.
- [`have_query_cache`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_have_query_cache)

  The query cache was removed in MySQL 8.0.3.
  [`have_query_cache`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_have_query_cache) is
  deprecated, always has a value of `NO`, and
  you should expect it to be removed in a future MySQL release.
- [`have_rtree_keys`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_have_rtree_keys)

  `YES` if `RTREE` indexes are
  available, `NO` if not. (These are used for
  spatial indexes in `MyISAM` tables.)

  Whether the statement execution timeout feature is available
  (see [Statement Execution Time Optimizer Hints](optimizer-hints.md#optimizer-hints-execution-time "Statement Execution Time Optimizer Hints")). The
  value can be `NO` if the background thread
  used by this feature could not be initialized.
- [`have_symlink`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_have_symlink)

  `YES` if symbolic link support is enabled,
  `NO` if not. This is required on Unix for
  support of the `DATA DIRECTORY` and
  `INDEX DIRECTORY` table options. If the
  server is started with the
  [`--skip-symbolic-links`](server-options.md#option_mysqld_symbolic-links)
  option, the value is `DISABLED`.

  This variable has no meaning on Windows.

  Note

  Symbolic link support, along with the
  [`--symbolic-links`](server-options.md#option_mysqld_symbolic-links) option that
  controls it, is deprecated; expect these to be removed in a
  future version of MySQL. In addition, the option is disabled
  by default. The related
  [`have_symlink`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_have_symlink) system
  variable also is deprecated and you should expect it to be
  removed in a future version of MySQL.

  [Section 15.7.3.1, “ANALYZE TABLE Statement”](analyze-table.md "15.7.3.1 ANALYZE TABLE Statement").

  Setting the session value of this system variable is a
  restricted operation. The session user must have privileges
  sufficient to set restricted session variables. See
  [Section 7.1.9.1, “System Variable Privileges”](system-variable-privileges.md "7.1.9.1 System Variable Privileges").

  The MySQL server maintains an in-memory host cache that
  contains client host name and IP address information and is
  used to avoid Domain Name System (DNS) lookups; see
  [Section 7.1.12.3, “DNS Lookups and the Host Cache”](host-cache.md "7.1.12.3 DNS Lookups and the Host Cache").

  The [`host_cache_size`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_host_cache_size) variable
  controls the size of the host cache, as well as the size of
  the Performance Schema [`host_cache`](performance-schema-host-cache-table.md "29.12.21.3 The host_cache Table")
  table that exposes the cache contents. Setting
  [`host_cache_size`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_host_cache_size) has these
  effects:

  - Setting the size to 0 disables the host cache. With the
    cache disabled, the server performs a DNS lookup every
    time a client connects.
  - Changing the size at runtime causes an implicit host cache
    flushing operation that clears the host cache, truncates
    the [`host_cache`](performance-schema-host-cache-table.md "29.12.21.3 The host_cache Table") table, and
    unblocks any blocked hosts.

  The default value is autosized to 128, plus 1 for a value of
  [`max_connections`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_max_connections) up to 500,
  plus 1 for every increment of 20 over 500 in the
  [`max_connections`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_max_connections) value, capped
  to a limit of 2000.

  Using the [`--skip-host-cache`](server-options.md#option_mysqld_skip-host-cache)
  option is similar to setting the
  `host_cache_size` system variable to 0, but
  `host_cache_size` is more flexible because it
  can also be used to resize, enable, and disable the host cache
  at runtime, not just at server startup.

  Starting the server with
  [`--skip-host-cache`](server-options.md#option_mysqld_skip-host-cache) does not
  prevent runtime changes to the value of
  `host_cache_size`, but such changes have no
  effect and the cache is not re-enabled even if
  `host_cache_size` is set larger than 0.

  Setting the `host_cache_size` system variable
  rather than the
  [`--skip-host-cache`](server-options.md#option_mysqld_skip-host-cache) option is
  preferred for the reasons given in the previous paragraph. In
  addition, the `--skip-host-cache` option is
  deprecated and its removal is expected in a future version of
  MySQL; in MySQL 8.0.29 and later, using the option raises a
  warning.
- [`hostname`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_hostname)

  | Scope | Global |
  | Dynamic | No |
  | [`SET_VAR`](optimizer-hints.md#optimizer-hints-set-var "Variable-Setting Hint Syntax") Hint Applies | No |
  | Type | String |

  The server sets this variable to the server host name at
  startup. The maximum length is 255 characters as of MySQL
  8.0.17, per RFC 1034, and 60 characters before that.
- [`identity`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_identity)

  This variable is a synonym for the
  [`last_insert_id`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_last_insert_id) variable. It
  exists for compatibility with other database systems. You can
  read its value with `SELECT @@identity`, and
  set it using `SET identity`.
- [`init_connect`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_init_connect)

  |  |  |
  | --- | --- |
  | Command-Line Format | `--init-connect=name` |
  | System Variable | `init_connect` |
  | Scope | Global |
  | Dynamic | Yes |
  | [`SET_VAR`](optimizer-hints.md#optimizer-hints-set-var "Variable-Setting Hint Syntax") Hint Applies | No |
  | Type | String |

  A string to be executed by the server for each client that
  connects. The string consists of one or more SQL statements,
  separated by semicolon characters.

  For users that have the
  [`CONNECTION_ADMIN`](privileges-provided.md#priv_connection-admin) privilege (or
  the deprecated [`SUPER`](privileges-provided.md#priv_super)
  privilege), the content of
  [`init_connect`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_init_connect) is not executed.
  This is done so that an erroneous value for
  [`init_connect`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_init_connect) does not prevent
  all clients from connecting. For example, the value might
  contain a statement that has a syntax error, thus causing
  client connections to fail. Not executing
  [`init_connect`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_init_connect) for users that
  have the [`CONNECTION_ADMIN`](privileges-provided.md#priv_connection-admin) or
  [`SUPER`](privileges-provided.md#priv_super) privilege enables them to
  open a connection and fix the
  [`init_connect`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_init_connect) value.

  [`init_connect`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_init_connect) execution is
  skipped for any client user with an expired password. This is
  done because such a user cannot execute arbitrary statements,
  and thus [`init_connect`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_init_connect)
  execution fails, leaving the client unable to connect.
  Skipping [`init_connect`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_init_connect)
  execution enables the user to connect and change password.

  The server discards any result sets produced by statements in
  the value of [`init_connect`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_init_connect).
- [`information_schema_stats_expiry`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_information_schema_stats_expiry)

  |  |  |
  | --- | --- |
  | Command-Line Format | `--information-schema-stats-expiry=#` |
  | System Variable | `information_schema_stats_expiry` |
  | Scope | Global, Session |
  | Dynamic | Yes |
  | [`SET_VAR`](optimizer-hints.md#optimizer-hints-set-var "Variable-Setting Hint Syntax") Hint Applies | No |
  | Type | Integer |
  | Default Value | `86400` |
  | Minimum Value | `0` |
  | Maximum Value | `31536000` |
  | Unit | seconds |

  Some `INFORMATION_SCHEMA` tables contain
  columns that provide table statistics:

  ```none
  STATISTICS.CARDINALITY
  TABLES.AUTO_INCREMENT
  TABLES.AVG_ROW_LENGTH
  TABLES.CHECKSUM
  TABLES.CHECK_TIME
  TABLES.CREATE_TIME
  TABLES.DATA_FREE
  TABLES.DATA_LENGTH
  TABLES.INDEX_LENGTH
  TABLES.MAX_DATA_LENGTH
  TABLES.TABLE_ROWS
  TABLES.UPDATE_TIME
  ```

  Those columns represent dynamic table metadata; that is,
  information that changes as table contents change.

  By default, MySQL retrieves cached values for those columns
  from the `mysql.index_stats` and
  `mysql.table_stats` dictionary tables when
  the columns are queried, which is more efficient than
  retrieving statistics directly from the storage engine. If
  cached statistics are not available or have expired, MySQL
  retrieves the latest statistics from the storage engine and
  caches them in the `mysql.index_stats` and
  `mysql.table_stats` dictionary tables.
  Subsequent queries retrieve the cached statistics until the
  cached statistics expire. A server restart or the first
  opening of the `mysql.index_stats` and
  `mysql.table_stats` tables do not update
  cached statistics automatically.

  The
  [`information_schema_stats_expiry`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_information_schema_stats_expiry)
  session variable defines the period of time before cached
  statistics expire. The default is 86400 seconds (24 hours),
  but the time period can be extended to as much as one year.

  To update cached values at any time for a given table, use
  [`ANALYZE TABLE`](analyze-table.md "15.7.3.1 ANALYZE TABLE Statement").

  To always retrieve the latest statistics directly from the
  storage engine and bypass cached values, set
  [`information_schema_stats_expiry`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_information_schema_stats_expiry)
  to `0`.

  Querying statistics columns does not store or update
  statistics in the `mysql.index_stats` and
  `mysql.table_stats` dictionary tables under
  these circumstances:

  - When cached statistics have not expired.
  - When
    [`information_schema_stats_expiry`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_information_schema_stats_expiry)
    is set to 0.
  - When the server is in
    [`read_only`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_read_only),
    [`super_read_only`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_super_read_only),
    [`transaction_read_only`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_transaction_read_only), or
    [`innodb_read_only`](innodb-parameters.md#sysvar_innodb_read_only) mode.
  - When the query also fetches Performance Schema data.

  The statistics cache may be updated during a
  multiple-statement transaction before it is known whether the
  transaction commits. As a result, the cache may contain
  information that does not correspond to a known committed
  state. This can occur with
  [`autocommit=0`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_autocommit) or after
  [`START
  TRANSACTION`](commit.md "15.3.1 START TRANSACTION, COMMIT, and ROLLBACK Statements").

  [`information_schema_stats_expiry`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_information_schema_stats_expiry)
  is a session variable, and each client session can define its
  own expiration value. Statistics that are retrieved from the
  storage engine and cached by one session are available to
  other sessions.

  [Section 10.2.3, “Optimizing INFORMATION\_SCHEMA Queries”](information-schema-optimization.md "10.2.3 Optimizing INFORMATION_SCHEMA Queries").
- [`init_file`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_init_file)

  | Scope | Global |
  | Dynamic | No |
  | [`SET_VAR`](optimizer-hints.md#optimizer-hints-set-var "Variable-Setting Hint Syntax") Hint Applies | No |
  | Type | File name |

  If specified, this variable names a file containing SQL
  statements to be read and executed during the startup process.
  Prior to MySQL 8.0.18, each statement must be on a single line
  and should not include comments. As of MySQL 8.0.18, the
  acceptable format for statements in the file is expanded to
  support these constructs:

  - `delimiter ;`, to set the statement
    delimiter to the `;` character.
  - `delimiter $$`, to set the statement
    delimiter to the `$$` character sequence.
  - Multiple statements on the same line, delimited by the
    current delimiter.
  - Multiple-line statements.
  - Comments from a `#` character to the end
    of the line.
  - Comments from a `--` sequence to
    the end of the line.
  - C-style comments from a `/*` sequence to
    the following `*/` sequence, including
    over multiple lines.
  - Multiple-line string literals enclosed within either
    single quote (`'`) or double quote
    (`"`) characters.

  If the server is started with the
  [`--initialize`](server-options.md#option_mysqld_initialize) or
  [`--initialize-insecure`](server-options.md#option_mysqld_initialize-insecure) option,
  it operates in bootstrap mode and some functionality is
  unavailable that limits the statements permitted in the file.
  These include statements that relate to account management
  (such as [`CREATE USER`](create-user.md "15.7.1.3 CREATE USER Statement") or
  [`GRANT`](grant.md "15.7.1.6 GRANT Statement")), replication, and global
  transaction identifiers. See
  [Section 19.1.3, “Replication with Global Transaction Identifiers”](replication-gtids.md "19.1.3 Replication with Global Transaction Identifiers").

  As of MySQL 8.0.17, threads created during server startup are
  used for tasks such as creating the data dictionary, running
  upgrade procedures, and creating system tables. To ensure a
  stable and predictable environment, these threads are executed
  with the server built-in defaults for some system variables,
  such as [`sql_mode`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_sql_mode),
  [`character_set_server`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_character_set_server),
  [`collation_server`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_collation_server),
  [`completion_type`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_completion_type),
  [`explicit_defaults_for_timestamp`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_explicit_defaults_for_timestamp),
  and [`default_table_encryption`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_default_table_encryption).

  These threads are also used to execute the statements in any
  file specified with [`init_file`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_init_file)
  when starting the server, so such statements execute with the
  server's built-in default values for those system variables.
- `innodb_xxx`

  [`InnoDB`](innodb-storage-engine.md "Chapter 17 The InnoDB Storage Engine") system variables are
  listed in [Section 17.14, “InnoDB Startup Options and System Variables”](innodb-parameters.md "17.14 InnoDB Startup Options and System Variables"). These variables
  control many aspects of storage, memory use, and I/O patterns
  for `InnoDB` tables, and are especially
  important now that `InnoDB` is the default
  storage engine.
- [`insert_id`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_insert_id)

  The value to be used by the following
  [`INSERT`](insert.md "15.2.7 INSERT Statement") or
  [`ALTER TABLE`](alter-table.md "15.1.9 ALTER TABLE Statement") statement when
  inserting an `AUTO_INCREMENT` value. This is
  mainly used with the binary log.

  Important

  In MySQL 8.0.16 and later, on-disk internal temporary tables
  always use the `InnoDB` storage engine; as
  of MySQL 8.0.16, this variable has been removed and is thus
  no longer supported.

  Prior to MySQL 8.0.16, this variable determines the storage
  engine used for on-disk internal temporary tables (see
  [Storage Engine for On-Disk Internal Temporary Tables](internal-temporary-tables.md#internal-temporary-tables-engines-disk "Storage Engine for On-Disk Internal Temporary Tables")).
  Permitted values are `MYISAM` and
  `INNODB` (the default).

  The storage engine for in-memory internal temporary tables
  (see [Section 10.4.4, “Internal Temporary Table Use in MySQL”](internal-temporary-tables.md "10.4.4 Internal Temporary Table Use in MySQL")). Permitted
  values are `TempTable` (the default) and
  `MEMORY`.

  The [optimizer](glossary.md#glos_optimizer "optimizer") uses the
  storage engine defined by
  [`internal_tmp_mem_storage_engine`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_internal_tmp_mem_storage_engine)
  for in-memory internal temporary tables.

  From MySQL 8.0.27, configuring a session setting for
  [`internal_tmp_mem_storage_engine`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_internal_tmp_mem_storage_engine)
  requires the
  [`SESSION_VARIABLES_ADMIN`](privileges-provided.md#priv_session-variables-admin) or
  [`SYSTEM_VARIABLES_ADMIN`](privileges-provided.md#priv_system-variables-admin)
  privilege.
- [`join_buffer_size`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_join_buffer_size)

  | Unit | bytes |
  | [Block Size](server-system-variables.md#system-variables-block-size "Note") | `128` |

  The minimum size of the buffer that is used for plain index
  scans, range index scans, and joins that do not use indexes
  and thus perform full table scans. In MySQL 8.0.18 and later,
  this variable also controls the amount of memory used for hash
  joins. Normally, the best way to get fast joins is to add
  indexes. Increase the value of
  [`join_buffer_size`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_join_buffer_size) to get a
  faster full join when adding indexes is not possible. One join
  buffer is allocated for each full join between two tables. For
  a complex join between several tables for which indexes are
  not used, multiple join buffers might be necessary.

  The default is 256KB. The maximum permissible setting for
  [`join_buffer_size`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_join_buffer_size) is
  4GB−1. Larger values are permitted for 64-bit platforms
  (except 64-bit Windows, for which large values are truncated
  to 4GB−1 with a warning). The block size is 128, and a
  value that is not an exact multiple of the block size is
  rounded down to the next lower multiple of the block size by
  MySQL Server before storing the value for the system variable.
  The parser allows values up to the maximum unsigned integer
  value for the platform (4294967295 or
  232−1 for a 32-bit system,
  18446744073709551615 or 264−1
  for a 64-bit system) but the actual maximum is a block size
  lower.

  Unless a Block Nested-Loop or Batched Key Access algorithm is
  used, there is no gain from setting the buffer larger than
  required to hold each matching row, and all joins allocate at
  least the minimum size, so use caution in setting this
  variable to a large value globally. It is better to keep the
  global setting small and change the session setting to a
  larger value only in sessions that are doing large joins, or
  change the setting on a per-query basis by using a
  `SET_VAR` optimizer hint (see
  [Section 10.9.3, “Optimizer Hints”](optimizer-hints.md "10.9.3 Optimizer Hints")). Memory allocation time can
  cause substantial performance drops if the global size is
  larger than needed by most queries that use it.

  When Block Nested-Loop is used, a larger join buffer can be
  beneficial up to the point where all required columns from all
  rows in the first table are stored in the join buffer. This
  depends on the query; the optimal size may be smaller than
  holding all rows from the first tables.

  When Batched Key Access is used, the value of
  [`join_buffer_size`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_join_buffer_size) defines how
  large the batch of keys is in each request to the storage
  engine. The larger the buffer, the more sequential access is
  made to the right hand table of a join operation, which can
  significantly improve performance.

  For additional information about join buffering, see
  [Section 10.2.1.7, “Nested-Loop Join Algorithms”](nested-loop-joins.md "10.2.1.7 Nested-Loop Join Algorithms"). For information about
  Batched Key Access, see

  If a `MyISAM` table is created with no
  `DATA DIRECTORY` option, the
  `.MYD` file is created in the database
  directory. By default, if `MyISAM` finds an
  existing `.MYD` file in this case, it
  overwrites it. The same applies to `.MYI`
  files for tables created with no `INDEX
  DIRECTORY` option. To suppress this behavior, set the
  [`keep_files_on_create`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_keep_files_on_create) variable
  to `ON` (1), in which case
  `MyISAM` does not overwrite existing files
  and returns an error instead. The default value is
  `OFF` (0).

  If a `MyISAM` table is created with a
  `DATA DIRECTORY` or `INDEX
  DIRECTORY` option and an existing
  `.MYD` or `.MYI` file is
  found, MyISAM always returns an error. It does not overwrite a
  file in the specified directory.

  | Scope | Global |
  | Dynamic | Yes |

  | Type | Integer |
  | Default Value | `8388608` |
  | Minimum Value | `0` |
  | Maximum Value (64-bit platforms) | `OS_PER_PROCESS_LIMIT` |
  | Maximum Value (32-bit platforms) | `4294967295` |
  | Unit | bytes |

  Index blocks for `MyISAM` tables are buffered
  and are shared by all threads.
  [`key_buffer_size`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_key_buffer_size) is the size
  of the buffer used for index blocks. The key buffer is also
  known as the key cache.

  The minimum permissible setting is 0, but you cannot set
  [`key_buffer_size`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_key_buffer_size) to 0
  dynamically. A setting of 0 drops the key cache, which is not
  permitted at runtime. Setting
  [`key_buffer_size`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_key_buffer_size) to 0 is
  permitted only at startup, in which case the key cache is not
  initialized. Changing the
  [`key_buffer_size`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_key_buffer_size) setting at
  runtime from a value of 0 to a permitted non-zero value
  initializes the key cache.

  [`key_buffer_size`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_key_buffer_size) can be
  increased or decreased only in increments or multiples of 4096
  bytes. Increasing or decreasing the setting by a nonconforming
  value produces a warning and truncates the setting to a
  conforming value.

  The maximum permissible setting for
  [`key_buffer_size`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_key_buffer_size) is
  4GB−1 on 32-bit platforms. Larger values are permitted
  for 64-bit platforms. The effective maximum size might be
  less, depending on your available physical RAM and per-process
  RAM limits imposed by your operating system or hardware
  platform. The value of this variable indicates the amount of
  memory requested. Internally, the server allocates as much
  memory as possible up to this amount, but the actual
  allocation might be less.

  You can increase the value to get better index handling for
  all reads and multiple writes; on a system whose primary
  function is to run MySQL using the
  [`MyISAM`](myisam-storage-engine.md "18.2 The MyISAM Storage Engine") storage engine, 25% of the
  machine's total memory is an acceptable value for this
  variable. However, you should be aware that, if you make the
  value too large (for example, more than 50% of the
  machine's total memory), your system might start to page
  and become extremely slow. This is because MySQL relies on the
  operating system to perform file system caching for data
  reads, so you must leave some room for the file system cache.
  You should also consider the memory requirements of any other
  storage engines that you may be using in addition to
  [`MyISAM`](myisam-storage-engine.md "18.2 The MyISAM Storage Engine").

  For even more speed when writing many rows at the same time,
  use [`LOCK TABLES`](lock-tables.md "15.3.6 LOCK TABLES and UNLOCK TABLES Statements"). See
  [Section 10.2.5.1, “Optimizing INSERT Statements”](insert-optimization.md "10.2.5.1 Optimizing INSERT Statements").

  You can check the performance of the key buffer by issuing a
  [`SHOW STATUS`](show-status.md "15.7.7.37 SHOW STATUS Statement") statement and
  examining the
  [`Key_read_requests`](server-status-variables.md#statvar_Key_read_requests),
  [`Key_reads`](server-status-variables.md#statvar_Key_reads),
  [`Key_write_requests`](server-status-variables.md#statvar_Key_write_requests), and
  [`Key_writes`](server-status-variables.md#statvar_Key_writes) status variables.
  (See [Section 15.7.7, “SHOW Statements”](show.md "15.7.7 SHOW Statements").) The
  `Key_reads/Key_read_requests` ratio should
  normally be less than 0.01. The
  `Key_writes/Key_write_requests` ratio is
  usually near 1 if you are using mostly updates and deletes,
  but might be much smaller if you tend to do updates that
  affect many rows at the same time or if you are using the
  `DELAY_KEY_WRITE` table option.

  The fraction of the key buffer in use can be determined using
  [`key_buffer_size`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_key_buffer_size) in
  conjunction with the
  [`Key_blocks_unused`](server-status-variables.md#statvar_Key_blocks_unused) status
  variable and the buffer block size, which is available from
  the [`key_cache_block_size`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_key_cache_block_size)
  system variable:

  ```simple
  1 - ((Key_blocks_unused * key_cache_block_size) / key_buffer_size)
  ```

  This value is an approximation because some space in the key
  buffer is allocated internally for administrative structures.
  Factors that influence the amount of overhead for these
  structures include block size and pointer size. As block size
  increases, the percentage of the key buffer lost to overhead
  tends to decrease. Larger blocks results in a smaller number
  of read operations (because more keys are obtained per read),
  but conversely an increase in reads of keys that are not
  examined (if not all keys in a block are relevant to a query).

  It is possible to create multiple `MyISAM`
  key caches. The size limit of 4GB applies to each cache
  individually, not as a group. See
  [Section 10.10.2, “The MyISAM Key Cache”](myisam-key-cache.md "10.10.2 The MyISAM Key Cache").

  This variable controls server-side `LOCAL`
  capability for [`LOAD DATA`](load-data.md "15.2.9 LOAD DATA Statement")
  statements. Depending on the
  [`local_infile`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_local_infile) setting, the

  and libraries are configured at build time or runtime), start
  [**mysqld**](mysqld.md "6.3.1 mysqld — The MySQL Server") with
  [`local_infile`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_local_infile) disabled or
  enabled, respectively.
  [`local_infile`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_local_infile) can also be set

  | Type | Integer |
  | Default Value | `31536000` |
  | Minimum Value | `1` |
  | Maximum Value | `31536000` |
  | Unit | seconds |

  This variable specifies the timeout in seconds for attempts to
  acquire metadata locks. The permissible values range from 1 to
  31536000 (1 year). The default is 31536000.

  This timeout applies to all statements that use metadata
  locks. These include DML and DDL operations on tables, views,
  stored procedures, and stored functions, as well as
  [`LOCK TABLES`](lock-tables.md "15.3.6 LOCK TABLES and UNLOCK TABLES Statements"),
  [`FLUSH TABLES WITH READ LOCK`](flush.md#flush-tables-with-read-lock),
  and [`HANDLER`](handler.md "15.2.5 HANDLER Statement") statements.

  This timeout does not apply to implicit accesses to system
  tables in the `mysql` database, such as grant
  tables modified by [`GRANT`](grant.md "15.7.1.6 GRANT Statement") or
  [`REVOKE`](revoke.md "15.7.1.8 REVOKE Statement") statements or table
  logging statements. The timeout does apply to system tables
  accessed directly, such as with
  [`SELECT`](select.md "15.2.13 SELECT Statement") or
  [`UPDATE`](update.md "15.2.17 UPDATE Statement").

  The timeout value applies separately for each metadata lock
  attempt. A given statement can require more than one lock, so
  it is possible for the statement to block for longer than the
  [`lock_wait_timeout`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_lock_wait_timeout) value
  before reporting a timeout error. When lock timeout occurs,
  [`ER_LOCK_WAIT_TIMEOUT`](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/mysql-errors/8.0/en/server-error-reference.html#error_er_lock_wait_timeout) is
  reported.

  [`lock_wait_timeout`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_lock_wait_timeout) also
  defines the amount of time that a [`LOCK
  INSTANCE FOR BACKUP`](lock-instance-for-backup.md "15.3.5 LOCK INSTANCE FOR BACKUP and UNLOCK INSTANCE Statements") statement waits for a lock
  before giving up.

  The components to enable for error logging. The variable may
  contain a list with 0, 1, or many elements. In the latter
  case, elements may be delimited by semicolon or (as of MySQL
  8.0.12) comma, optionally followed by space. A given setting
  cannot use both semicolon and comma separators. Component
  order is significant because the server executes components in
  the order listed.

  From MySQL 8.0.30, any loadable (not built in) component named
  in the [`log_error_services`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_log_error_services) is
  implicitly loaded if it is not already loaded. Before MySQL
  8.0.30, any loadable (not built in) component named in the
  [`log_error_services`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_log_error_services) value must
  first be installed with [`INSTALL
  COMPONENT`](install-component.md "15.7.4.3 INSTALL COMPONENT Statement"). For more information, see

  The
  [`log_error_suppression_list`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_log_error_suppression_list)
  system variable applies to events intended for the error log
  and specifies which events to suppress when they occur with a
  priority of `WARNING` or
  `INFORMATION`. For example, if a particular
  type of warning is considered undesirable “noise”
  in the error log because it occurs frequently but is not of
  interest, it can be suppressed. This variable affects
  filtering performed by the
  `log_filter_internal` error log filter
  component, which is enabled by default (see
  [Section 7.5.3, “Error Log Components”](error-log-components.md "7.5.3 Error Log Components")). If
  `log_filter_internal` is disabled,
  [`log_error_suppression_list`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_log_error_suppression_list)
  has no effect.

  The
  [`log_error_suppression_list`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_log_error_suppression_list)
  value may be the empty string for no suppression, or a list of
  one or more comma-separated values indicating the error codes
  to suppress. Error codes may be specified in symbolic or
  numeric form. A numeric code may be specified with or without
  the `MY-` prefix. Leading zeros in the
  numeric part are not significant. Examples of permitted code
  formats:

  ```simple
  ER_SERVER_SHUTDOWN_COMPLETE
  MY-000031
  000031
  MY-31
  31
  ```

  Symbolic values are preferable to numeric values for
  readability and portability. For information about the
  permitted error symbols and numbers, see
  [MySQL 8.0 Error Message Reference](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/mysql-errors/8.0/en/).

  The effect of
  [`log_error_suppression_list`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_log_error_suppression_list)
  combines with that of

  The [`log_error_verbosity`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_log_error_verbosity)
  system variable specifies the verbosity for handling events
  intended for the error log. This variable affects filtering
  performed by the `log_filter_internal` error
  log filter component, which is enabled by default (see
  [Section 7.5.3, “Error Log Components”](error-log-components.md "7.5.3 Error Log Components")). If
  `log_filter_internal` is disabled,
  [`log_error_verbosity`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_log_error_verbosity) has no
  effect.

  Events intended for the error log have a priority of
  `ERROR`, `WARNING`, or
  `INFORMATION`.
  [`log_error_verbosity`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_log_error_verbosity) controls
  verbosity based on which priorities to permit for messages
  written to the log, as shown in the following table.

  | log\_error\_verbosity Value | Permitted Message Priorities |
  | --- | --- |
  | 1 | `ERROR` |
  | 2 | `ERROR`, `WARNING` |
  | 3 | `ERROR`, `WARNING`, `INFORMATION` |

  There is also a priority of `SYSTEM`. System
  messages about non-error situations are printed to the error
  log regardless of the
  [`log_error_verbosity`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_log_error_verbosity) value.
  These messages include startup and shutdown messages, and some
  significant changes to settings.

  The effect of
  [`log_error_verbosity`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_log_error_verbosity) combines
  with that of
  [`log_error_suppression_list`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_log_error_suppression_list).
  For additional information, see
  [Section 7.4.2.5, “Priority-Based Error Log Filtering (log\_filter\_internal)”](error-log-priority-based-filtering.md "7.4.2.5 Priority-Based Error Log Filtering (log_filter_internal)").
- [`log_output`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_log_output)

  | Type | Set |
  | Default Value | `FILE` |
  | Valid Values | `TABLE`  `FILE`  `NONE` |

  The destination or destinations for general query log and slow
  query log output. The value is a list one or more
  comma-separated words chosen from `TABLE`,
  `FILE`, and `NONE`.
  `TABLE` selects logging to the
  [`general_log`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_general_log) and
  `slow_log` tables in the
  `mysql` system schema.
  `FILE` selects logging to log files.
  `NONE` disables logging. If
  `NONE` is present in the value, it takes
  precedence over any other words that are present.
  `TABLE` and `FILE` can both
  be given to select both log output destinations.

  This variable selects log output destinations, but does not
  enable log output. To do that, enable the
  [`general_log`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_general_log) and
  [`slow_query_log`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_slow_query_log) system
  variables. For `FILE` logging, the
  [`general_log_file`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_general_log_file) and
  [`slow_query_log_file`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_slow_query_log_file) system
  variables determine the log file locations. For more
  information, see [Section 7.4.1, “Selecting General Query Log and Slow Query Log Output Destinations”](log-destinations.md "7.4.1 Selecting General Query Log and Slow Query Log Output Destinations").

  | Type | Boolean |
  | Default Value | `OFF` |

  If you enable this variable with the slow query log enabled,
  queries that are expected to retrieve all rows are logged. See
  [Section 7.4.5, “The Slow Query Log”](slow-query-log.md "7.4.5 The Slow Query Log"). This option does not
  necessarily mean that no index is used. For example, a query
  that uses a full index scan uses an index but would be logged
  because the index would not limit the number of rows.
- [`log_raw`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_log_raw)

  | Type | Boolean |
  | Default Value | `OFF` |

  The [`log_raw`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_log_raw) system variable
  is initially set to the value of the
  [`--log-raw`](server-options.md#option_mysqld_log-raw) option. See the
  description of that option for more information. The system
  variable may also be set at runtime to change password masking
  behavior.

  If the slow query log is enabled and the output destination
  includes `FILE`, the server writes additional
  fields to log file lines that provide information about slow
  statements. See [Section 7.4.5, “The Slow Query Log”](slow-query-log.md "7.4.5 The Slow Query Log").
  `TABLE` output is unaffected.

  Prior to MySQL 8.0, this variable controlled
  whether to perform error logging to the system log (the Event
  Log on Windows, and `syslog` on Unix and
  Unix-like systems).

  In MySQL 8.0, the
  `log_sink_syseventlog` log component
  implements error logging to the system log (see
  [Section 7.4.2.8, “Error Logging to the System Log”](error-log-syslog.md "7.4.2.8 Error Logging to the System Log")), so this type of logging
  can be enabled by adding that component to the
  [`log_error_services`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_log_error_services) system
  variable. [`log_syslog`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_log_syslog) is
  removed. (Prior to MySQL 8.0.13,
  [`log_syslog`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_log_syslog) exists but is
  deprecated and has no effect.)

  | System Variable | `log_timestamps` |
  | Scope | Global |
  | Dynamic | Yes |
  | [`SET_VAR`](optimizer-hints.md#optimizer-hints-set-var "Variable-Setting Hint Syntax") Hint Applies | No |
  | Type | Enumeration |
  | Default Value | `UTC` |
  | Valid Values | `UTC`  `SYSTEM` |

  This variable controls the time zone of timestamps in messages
  written to the error log, and in general query log and slow
  query log messages written to files. It does not affect the
  time zone of general query log and slow query log messages
  written to tables (`mysql.general_log`,
  `mysql.slow_log`). Rows retrieved from those
  tables can be converted from the local system time zone to any
  desired time zone with
  [`CONVERT_TZ()`](date-and-time-functions.md#function_convert-tz) or by setting the
  session [`time_zone`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_time_zone) system
  variable.

  Permitted [`log_timestamps`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_log_timestamps)
  values are `UTC` (the default) and
  `SYSTEM` (the local system time zone).

  Timestamps are written using ISO 8601 / RFC 3339 format:
  `YYYY-MM-DDThh:mm:ss.uuuuuu`
  plus a tail value of `Z` signifying Zulu time
  (UTC) or `±hh:mm` (an offset from
  UTC).

  | Type | Integer |
  | Default Value | `0` |
  | Minimum Value | `0` |
  | Maximum Value | `4294967295` |

  If
  [`log_queries_not_using_indexes`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_log_queries_not_using_indexes)
  is enabled, the
  [`log_throttle_queries_not_using_indexes`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_log_throttle_queries_not_using_indexes)
  variable limits the number of such queries per minute that can
  be written to the slow query log. A value of 0 (the default)
  means “no limit”. For more information, see
  [Section 7.4.5, “The Slow Query Log”](slow-query-log.md "7.4.5 The Slow Query Log").
- [`long_query_time`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_long_query_time)

  |  |  |
  | --- | --- |
  | Command-Line Format | `--long-query-time=#` |
  | System Variable | `long_query_time` |
  | Scope | Global, Session |
  | Dynamic | Yes |
  | [`SET_VAR`](optimizer-hints.md#optimizer-hints-set-var "Variable-Setting Hint Syntax") Hint Applies | No |
  | Type | Numeric |
  | Default Value | `10` |
  | Minimum Value | `0` |
  | Maximum Value | `31536000` |
  | Unit | seconds |

  If a query takes longer than this many seconds, the server
  increments the [`Slow_queries`](server-status-variables.md#statvar_Slow_queries)
  status variable. If the slow query log is enabled, the query
  is logged to the slow query log file. This value is measured
  in real time, not CPU time, so a query that is under the
  threshold on a lightly loaded system might be above the
  threshold on a heavily loaded one. The minimum and default
  values of
  [`long_query_time`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_long_query_time)
  are 0 and 10, respectively. The maximum is 31536000, which is
  365 days in seconds. The value can be specified to a
  resolution of microseconds. See
  [Section 7.4.5, “The Slow Query Log”](slow-query-log.md "7.4.5 The Slow Query Log").

  Smaller values of this variable result in more statements
  being considered long-running, with the result that more space
  is required for the slow query log. For very small values
  (less than one second), the log may grow quite large in a
  small time. Increasing the number of statements considered
  long-running may also result in false positives for the
  “excessive Number of Long Running Processes”
  alert in MySQL Enterprise Monitor, especially if Group Replication is enabled.
  For these reasons, very small values should be used in test
  environments only, or, in production environments, only for a
  short period.

  [**mysqldump**](mysqldump.md "6.5.4 mysqldump — A Database Backup Program") performs a full table scan, which
  means its queries can often exceed a
  [`long_query_time`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_long_query_time) setting that
  is useful for regular queries. From MySQL 8.0.30, if you want
  to exclude most or all of [**mysqldump**](mysqldump.md "6.5.4 mysqldump — A Database Backup Program")’s
  queries from the slow query log, you can set
  [**mysqldump**](mysqldump.md "6.5.4 mysqldump — A Database Backup Program")’s
  [`--mysqld-long-query-time`](mysqldump.md#option_mysqldump_mysqld-long-query-time)
  command line option to change the session value of the system
  variable to a higher value.
- [`low_priority_updates`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_low_priority_updates)

  |  |  |
  | --- | --- |
  | Command-Line Format | `--low-priority-updates[={OFF|ON}]` |

  | Dynamic | Yes |
  | [`SET_VAR`](optimizer-hints.md#optimizer-hints-set-var "Variable-Setting Hint Syntax") Hint Applies | No |
  | Type | Boolean |
  | Default Value | `OFF` |

  If set to `1`, all
  [`INSERT`](insert.md "15.2.7 INSERT Statement"),
  [`UPDATE`](update.md "15.2.17 UPDATE Statement"),
  [`DELETE`](delete.md "15.2.2 DELETE Statement"), and `LOCK TABLE
  WRITE` statements wait until there is no pending
  [`SELECT`](select.md "15.2.13 SELECT Statement") or `LOCK TABLE
  READ` on the affected table. The same effect can be
  obtained using `{INSERT | REPLACE | DELETE | UPDATE}
  LOW_PRIORITY ...` to lower the priority of only one
  query. This variable affects only storage engines that use
  only table-level locking (such as `MyISAM`,
  `MEMORY`, and `MERGE`). See
  [Section 10.11.2, “Table Locking Issues”](table-locking.md "10.11.2 Table Locking Issues").

  As of MySQL 8.0.27, setting the session value of this system
  variable is a restricted operation. The session user must have
  privileges sufficient to set restricted session variables. See
  [Section 7.1.9.1, “System Variable Privileges”](system-variable-privileges.md "7.1.9.1 System Variable Privileges").
- [`lower_case_file_system`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_lower_case_file_system)

  | System Variable | `lower_case_file_system` |
  | Scope | Global |
  | Dynamic | No |
  | [`SET_VAR`](optimizer-hints.md#optimizer-hints-set-var "Variable-Setting Hint Syntax") Hint Applies | No |
  | Type | Boolean |

  This variable describes the case sensitivity of file names on
  the file system where the data directory is located.
  `OFF` means file names are case-sensitive,
  `ON` means they are not case-sensitive. This
  variable is read only because it reflects a file system
  attribute and setting it would have no effect on the file
  system.
- [`lower_case_table_names`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_lower_case_table_names)

  |  |  |
  | --- | --- |
  | Command-Line Format | `--lower-case-table-names[=#]` |
  | System Variable | `lower_case_table_names` |
  | Scope | Global |
  | Dynamic | No |
  | [`SET_VAR`](optimizer-hints.md#optimizer-hints-set-var "Variable-Setting Hint Syntax") Hint Applies | No |
  | Type | Integer |
  | Default Value (macOS) | `2` |
  | Default Value (Unix) | `0` |
  | Default Value (Windows) | `1` |
  | Minimum Value | `0` |
  | Maximum Value | `2` |

  If set to 0, table names are stored as specified and
  comparisons are case-sensitive. If set to 1, table names are
  stored in lowercase on disk and comparisons are not
  case-sensitive. If set to 2, table names are stored as given
  but compared in lowercase. This option also applies to
  database names and table aliases. For additional details, see
  [Section 11.2.3, “Identifier Case Sensitivity”](identifier-case-sensitivity.md "11.2.3 Identifier Case Sensitivity").

  The default value of this variable is platform-dependent (see
  [`lower_case_file_system`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_lower_case_file_system)). On
  Linux and other Unix-like systems, the default is
  `0`. On Windows the default value is
  `1`. On macOS, the default value is
  `2`. On Linux (and other Unix-like systems),
  setting the value to `2` is not supported;
  the server forces the value to `0` instead.

  You should *not* set
  [`lower_case_table_names`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_lower_case_table_names) to 0
  if you are running MySQL on a system where the data directory
  resides on a case-insensitive file system (such as on Windows
  or macOS). It is an unsupported combination that could result
  in a hang condition when running an `INSERT INTO ...
  SELECT ... FROM tbl_name`
  operation with the wrong *`tbl_name`*
  lettercase. With `MyISAM`, accessing table
  names using different lettercases could cause index
  corruption.

  An error message is printed and the server exits if you
  attempt to start the server with
  [`--lower_case_table_names=0`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_lower_case_table_names) on
  a case-insensitive file system.

  The setting of this variable affects the behavior of
  replication filtering options with regard to case sensitivity.
  For more information, see [Section 19.2.5, “How Servers Evaluate Replication Filtering Rules”](replication-rules.md "19.2.5 How Servers Evaluate Replication Filtering Rules").

  It is prohibited to start the server with a
  [`lower_case_table_names`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_lower_case_table_names)
  setting that is different from the setting used when the
  server was initialized. The restriction is necessary because
  collations used by various data dictionary table fields are
  determined by the setting defined when the server is
  initialized, and restarting the server with a different
  setting would introduce inconsistencies with respect to how
  identifiers are ordered and compared.

  It is therefore necessary to configure
  [`lower_case_table_names`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_lower_case_table_names) to the
  desired setting before initializing the server. In most cases,
  this requires configuring
  [`lower_case_table_names`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_lower_case_table_names) in a
  MySQL option file before starting the MySQL server for the
  first time. For APT installations on Debian and Ubuntu,
  however, the server is initialized for you, and there is no
  opportunity to configure the setting in an option file
  beforehand. You must therefore use the
  `debconf-set-selection` utility prior to
  installing MySQL using APT to enable
  [`lower_case_table_names`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_lower_case_table_names). To do
  so, run this command before installing MySQL using APT:

  ```sql
  $> sudo debconf-set-selections <<< "mysql-server mysql-server/lowercase-table-names select Enabled"
  ```

  Note

  The ability to enable
  [`lower_case_table_names`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_lower_case_table_names)
  using `debconf-set-selections` was added in
  MySQL 8.0.17. Enabling
  [`lower_case_table_names`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_lower_case_table_names) sets
  the value to 1.
- [`mandatory_roles`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_mandatory_roles)

  |  |  |
  | --- | --- |
  | Command-Line Format | `--mandatory-roles=value` |
  | System Variable | `mandatory_roles` |
  | Scope | Global |
  | Dynamic | Yes |
  | [`SET_VAR`](optimizer-hints.md#optimizer-hints-set-var "Variable-Setting Hint Syntax") Hint Applies | No |
  | Type | String |
  | Default Value | `empty string` |

  Roles the server should treat as mandatory. In effect, these
  roles are automatically granted to every user, although
  setting [`mandatory_roles`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_mandatory_roles) does
  not actually change any user accounts, and the granted roles
  are not visible in the `mysql.role_edges`
  system table.

  The variable value is a comma-separated list of role names.
  Example:

  ```sql
  SET PERSIST mandatory_roles = '`role1`@`%`,`role2`,role3,role4@localhost';
  ```

  Setting the runtime value of
  [`mandatory_roles`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_mandatory_roles) requires the
  [`ROLE_ADMIN`](privileges-provided.md#priv_role-admin) privilege, in
  addition to the
  [`SYSTEM_VARIABLES_ADMIN`](privileges-provided.md#priv_system-variables-admin)
  privilege (or the deprecated
  [`SUPER`](privileges-provided.md#priv_super) privilege) normally
  required to set a global system variable runtime value.

  Role names consist of a user part and host part in
  `user_name@host_name`
  format. The host part, if omitted, defaults to
  `%`. For additional information, see
  [Section 8.2.5, “Specifying Role Names”](role-names.md "8.2.5 Specifying Role Names").

  The [`mandatory_roles`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_mandatory_roles) value is
  a string, so user names and host names, if quoted, must be
  written in a fashion permitted for quoting within quoted
  strings.

  Roles named in the value of
  [`mandatory_roles`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_mandatory_roles) cannot be
  revoked with [`REVOKE`](revoke.md "15.7.1.8 REVOKE Statement") or dropped
  with [`DROP ROLE`](drop-role.md "15.7.1.4 DROP ROLE Statement") or
  [`DROP USER`](drop-user.md "15.7.1.5 DROP USER Statement").

  To prevent sessions from being made system sessions by
  default, a role that has the
  [`SYSTEM_USER`](privileges-provided.md#priv_system-user) privilege cannot be
  listed in the value of the
  [`mandatory_roles`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_mandatory_roles) system
  variable:

  - If [`mandatory_roles`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_mandatory_roles) is
    assigned a role at startup that has the
    [`SYSTEM_USER`](privileges-provided.md#priv_system-user) privilege, the
    server writes a message to the error log and exits.
  - If [`mandatory_roles`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_mandatory_roles) is
    assigned a role at runtime that has the
    [`SYSTEM_USER`](privileges-provided.md#priv_system-user) privilege, an
    error occurs and the
    [`mandatory_roles`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_mandatory_roles) value
    remains unchanged.

  Mandatory roles, like explicitly granted roles, do not take
  effect until activated (see
  [Activating Roles](roles.md#roles-activating "Activating Roles")). At login time, role
  activation occurs for all granted roles if the
  [`activate_all_roles_on_login`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_activate_all_roles_on_login)
  system variable is enabled; otherwise, or for roles that are
  set as default roles otherwise. At runtime,
  [`SET ROLE`](set-role.md "15.7.1.11 SET ROLE Statement") activates roles.

  Roles that do not exist when assigned to
  [`mandatory_roles`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_mandatory_roles) but are
  created later may require special treatment to be considered
  mandatory. For details, see [Defining Mandatory Roles](roles.md#mandatory-roles "Defining Mandatory Roles").

  [`SHOW GRANTS`](show-grants.md "15.7.7.21 SHOW GRANTS Statement") displays mandatory
  roles according to the rules described in

  | Maximum Value | `1073741824` |
  | Unit | bytes |
  | [Block Size](server-system-variables.md#system-variables-block-size "Note") | `1024` |

  The maximum size of one packet or any generated/intermediate
  string, or any parameter sent by the
  [`mysql_stmt_send_long_data()`](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/c-api/8.0/en/mysql-stmt-send-long-data.html) C
  API function. The default is 64MB.

  The packet message buffer is initialized to
  [`net_buffer_length`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_net_buffer_length) bytes, but
  can grow up to
  [`max_allowed_packet`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_max_allowed_packet) bytes when
  needed. This value by default is small, to catch large
  (possibly incorrect) packets.

  You must increase this value if you are using large
  [`BLOB`](blob.md "13.3.4 The BLOB and TEXT Types") columns or long strings.
  It should be as big as the largest
  [`BLOB`](blob.md "13.3.4 The BLOB and TEXT Types") you want to use. The
  protocol limit for
  [`max_allowed_packet`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_max_allowed_packet) is 1GB.
  The value should be a multiple of 1024; nonmultiples are
  rounded down to the nearest multiple.

  When you change the message buffer size by changing the value
  of the [`max_allowed_packet`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_max_allowed_packet)
  variable, you should also change the buffer size on the client
  side if your client program permits it. The default
  [`max_allowed_packet`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_max_allowed_packet) value
  built in to the client library is 1GB, but individual client
  programs might override this. For example,
  [**mysql**](mysql.md "6.5.1 mysql — The MySQL Command-Line Client") and [**mysqldump**](mysqldump.md "6.5.4 mysqldump — A Database Backup Program") have
  defaults of 16MB and 24MB, respectively. They also enable you
  to change the client-side value by setting
  [`max_allowed_packet`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_max_allowed_packet) on the
  command line or in an option file.

  The session value of this variable is read only. The client
  can receive up to as many bytes as the session value. However,
  the server does not send to the client more bytes than the
  current global
  [`max_allowed_packet`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_max_allowed_packet) value.
  (The global value could be less than the session value if the
  global value is changed after the client connects.)

  After [`max_connect_errors`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_max_connect_errors)
  successive connection requests from a host are interrupted
  without a successful connection, the server blocks that host
  from further connections. If a connection from a host is
  established successfully within fewer than
  [`max_connect_errors`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_max_connect_errors) attempts
  after a previous connection was interrupted, the error count
  for the host is cleared to zero. To unblock blocked hosts,

  | Unit | bytes |

  The maximum number of bytes of memory reserved per session for
  computation of normalized statement digests. Once that amount
  of space is used during digest computation, truncation occurs:
  no further tokens from a parsed statement are collected or
  figure into its digest value. Statements that differ only
  after that many bytes of parsed tokens produce the same
  normalized statement digest and are considered identical if
  compared or if aggregated for digest statistics.

  The length used for calculating a normalized statement digest
  is the sum of the length of the normalized statement digest
  and the length of the statement digest. Since the length of
  the statement digest is always 64, this is equivalent to
  [`LENGTH`](string-functions.md#function_length)
  `(`[`STATEMENT_DIGEST_TEXT(statement)
  ) + 64`](encryption-functions.md#function_statement-digest-text). This means that, when the value of
  `max_digest_length` is 1024 (the default),
  the maximum length for a normalized SQL statement before
  truncation occurs is in effect 960 bytes.

  Warning

  Setting [`max_digest_length`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_max_digest_length)
  to zero disables digest production, which also disables
  server functionality that requires digests, such as MySQL Enterprise Firewall.

  Decreasing the
  [`max_digest_length`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_max_digest_length) value
  reduces memory use but causes the digest value of more
  statements to become indistinguishable if they differ only at
  the end. Increasing the value permits longer statements to be
  distinguished but increases memory use, particularly for
  workloads that involve large numbers of simultaneous sessions
  (the server allocates
  [`max_digest_length`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_max_digest_length) bytes per
  session).

  The parser uses this system variable as a limit on the maximum
  length of normalized statement digests that it computes. The
  Performance Schema, if it tracks statement digests, makes a
  copy of the digest value, using the
  [`performance_schema_max_digest_length`](performance-schema-system-variables.md#sysvar_performance_schema_max_digest_length).
  system variable as a limit on the maximum length of digests
  that it stores. Consequently, if
  [`performance_schema_max_digest_length`](performance-schema-system-variables.md#sysvar_performance_schema_max_digest_length)
  is less than
  [`max_digest_length`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_max_digest_length), digest
  values stored in the Performance Schema are truncated relative
  to the original digest values.

  [`max_execution_time`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_max_execution_time) applies as
  follows:

  - The global

  This variable sets the maximum size to which user-created
  `MEMORY` tables are permitted to grow. The
  value of the variable is used to calculate
  `MEMORY` table `MAX_ROWS`
  values.

  Setting this variable has no effect on any existing
  `MEMORY` table, unless the table is
  re-created with a statement such as
  [`CREATE TABLE`](create-table.md "15.1.20 CREATE TABLE Statement") or altered with
  [`ALTER TABLE`](alter-table.md "15.1.9 ALTER TABLE Statement") or
  [`TRUNCATE TABLE`](truncate-table.md "15.1.37 TRUNCATE TABLE Statement"). A server
  restart also sets the maximum size of existing
  `MEMORY` tables to the global
  [`max_heap_table_size`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_max_heap_table_size) value.

  This variable is also used in conjunction with
  [`tmp_table_size`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_tmp_table_size) to limit the
  size of internal in-memory tables. See
  [Section 10.4.4, “Internal Temporary Table Use in MySQL”](internal-temporary-tables.md "10.4.4 Internal Temporary Table Use in MySQL").

  `max_heap_table_size` is not replicated. See

  As of MySQL 8.0.31, this represents a limit on the maximum
  number of row accesses in base tables made by a join. If the
  server's estimate indicates that a greater number of rows
  than `max_join_size` must be read from the
  base tables, the statement is rejected with an error.

  *MySQL 8.0.30 and earlier*: Do not permit
  statements that probably need to examine more than
  `max_join_size` rows (for single-table
  statements) or row combinations (for multiple-table
  statements) or that are likely to do more than
  `max_join_size` disk seeks. By setting this
  value, you can catch statements where keys are not used
  properly and that would probably take a long time. Set it if
  your users tend to perform joins that lack a
  `WHERE` clause, that take a long time, or
  that return millions of rows. For more information, see
  [Using Safe-Updates Mode (--safe-updates)](mysql-tips.md#safe-updates "Using Safe-Updates Mode (--safe-updates)").

  Regardless of MySQL release version, setting this variable to
  a value other than `DEFAULT` resets the value
  of [`sql_big_selects`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_sql_big_selects) to
  `0`. If you set the
  `sql_big_selects` value again, the

  This variable limits the total number of prepared statements
  in the server. It can be used in environments where there is
  the potential for denial-of-service attacks based on running
  the server out of memory by preparing huge numbers of
  statements. If the value is set lower than the current number
  of prepared statements, existing statements are not affected
  and can be used, but no new statements can be prepared until
  the current number drops below the limit. Setting the value to
  0 disables prepared statements.

  Limit the assumed maximum number of seeks when looking up rows
  based on a key. The MySQL optimizer assumes that no more than
  this number of key seeks are required when searching for
  matching rows in a table by scanning an index, regardless of
  the actual cardinality of the index (see
  [Section 15.7.7.22, “SHOW INDEX Statement”](show-index.md "15.7.7.22 SHOW INDEX Statement")). By setting this to a low value
  (say, 100), you can force MySQL to prefer indexes instead of

  only the first

  (This behavior differs from previous versions of MySQL, where
  this setting was applied to all values used in comparisons.)

  Increasing the value of
  [`max_sort_length`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_max_sort_length) may require

  The number of times that any given stored procedure may be

  Stored procedure recursion increases the demand on thread

  | Maximum Value | `4294967295` |

  The maximum number of simultaneous connections permitted to
  any given MySQL user account. A value of 0 (the default) means
  “no limit.”

  This variable has a global value that can be set at server
  startup or runtime. It also has a read-only session value that
  indicates the effective simultaneous-connection limit that
  applies to the account associated with the current session.
  The session value is initialized as follows:

  - If the user account has a nonzero
    `MAX_USER_CONNECTIONS` resource limit,
    the session
    [`max_user_connections`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_max_user_connections)
    value is set to that limit.
  - Otherwise, the session
    [`max_user_connections`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_max_user_connections)
    value is set to the global value.

  Account resource limits are specified using the
  [`CREATE USER`](create-user.md "15.7.1.3 CREATE USER Statement") or
  [`ALTER USER`](alter-user.md "15.7.1.1 ALTER USER Statement") statement. See
  [Section 8.2.21, “Setting Account Resource Limits”](user-resources.md "8.2.21 Setting Account Resource Limits").

  After this many write locks, permit some pending read lock
  requests to be processed in between. Write lock requests have
  higher priority than read lock requests. However, if
  [`max_write_lock_count`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_max_write_lock_count) is set
  to some low value (say, 10), read lock requests may be
  preferred over pending write lock requests if the read lock
  requests have already been passed over in favor of 10 write
  lock requests. Normally this behavior does not occur because
  [`max_write_lock_count`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_max_write_lock_count) by
  default has a very large value.

  (during [`REPAIR TABLE`](repair-table.md "15.7.3.5 REPAIR TABLE Statement"),
  [`ALTER TABLE`](alter-table.md "15.1.9 ALTER TABLE Statement"), or

  the key cache instead, which is slower. The value is given in
  bytes.

  If `MyISAM` index files exceed this size and
  disk space is available, increasing the value may help

  | Type | Enumeration |
  | Default Value | `OFF` |
  | Valid Values | `OFF`  `DEFAULT`  `BACKUP`  `FORCE`  `QUICK` |

  Set the `MyISAM` storage engine recovery
  mode. The variable value is any combination of the values of
  `OFF`, `DEFAULT`,
  `BACKUP`, `FORCE`, or
  `QUICK`. If you specify multiple values,
  separate them by commas. Specifying the variable with no value
  at server startup is the same as specifying
  `DEFAULT`, and specifying with an explicit
  value of `""` disables recovery (same as a
  value of `OFF`). If recovery is enabled, each
  time [**mysqld**](mysqld.md "6.3.1 mysqld — The MySQL Server") opens a
  `MyISAM` table, it checks whether the table
  is marked as crashed or was not closed properly. (The last
  option works only if you are running with external locking
  disabled.) If this is the case, [**mysqld**](mysqld.md "6.3.1 mysqld — The MySQL Server") runs
  a check on the table. If the table was corrupted,
  [**mysqld**](mysqld.md "6.3.1 mysqld — The MySQL Server") attempts to repair it.

  The following options affect how the repair works.

  | Option | Description |
  | --- | --- |
  | `OFF` | No recovery. |
  | `DEFAULT` | Recovery without backup, forcing, or quick checking. |
  | `BACKUP` | If the data file was changed during recovery, save a backup of the `tbl_name.MYD` file as `tbl_name-datetime.BAK`. |
  | `FORCE` | Run recovery even if we would lose more than one row from the `.MYD` file. |
  | `QUICK` | Do not check the rows in the table if there are not any delete blocks. |

  Before the server automatically repairs a table, it writes a
  note about the repair to the error log. If you want to be able
  to recover from most problems without user intervention, you
  should use the options `BACKUP,FORCE`. This
  forces a repair of a table even if some rows would be deleted,
  but it keeps the old data file as a backup so that you can
  later examine what happened.

  How the server treats `NULL` values when
  collecting statistics about the distribution of index values
  for `MyISAM` tables. This variable has three
  possible values, `nulls_equal`,
  `nulls_unequal`, and
  `nulls_ignored`. For
  `nulls_equal`, all `NULL`
  index values are considered equal and form a single value
  group that has a size equal to the number of
  `NULL` values. For
  `nulls_unequal`, `NULL`
  values are considered unequal, and each
  `NULL` forms a distinct value group of size
  1. For `nulls_ignored`,
  `NULL` values are ignored.

  The method that is used for generating table statistics
  influences how the optimizer chooses indexes for query
  execution, as described in [Section 10.3.8, “InnoDB and MyISAM Index Statistics Collection”](index-statistics.md "10.3.8 InnoDB and MyISAM Index Statistics Collection").

  (Windows only.) The access control granted to clients on the
  named pipe created by the MySQL server is set to the minimum
  necessary for successful communication when the
  [`named_pipe`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_named_pipe) system variable is
  enabled to support named-pipe connections. Some MySQL client
  software can open named pipe connections without any
  additional configuration; however, other client software may
  still require full access to open a named pipe connection.

  This variable sets the name of a Windows local group whose
  members are granted sufficient access by the MySQL server to
  use named-pipe clients. As of MySQL 8.0.24, the default value
  is set to an empty string, which means that no Windows user is
  granted full access to the named pipe.

  A new Windows local group name (for example,
  `mysql_access_client_users`) can be created
  in Windows and then used to replace the default value when
  access is absolutely necessary. In this case, limit the
  membership of the group to as few users as possible, removing
  users from the group when their client software is upgraded. A
  non-member of the group who attempts to open a connection to
  MySQL with the affected named-pipe client is denied access
  until a Windows administrator adds the user to the group.
  Newly added users must log out and log in again to join the
  group (required by Windows).

  Setting the value to `'*everyone*'` provides
  a language-independent way of referring to the Everyone group
  on Windows. The Everyone group is not secure by default.

  Each client thread is associated with a connection buffer and
  result buffer. Both begin with a size given by
  [`net_buffer_length`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_net_buffer_length) but are
  dynamically enlarged up to
  [`max_allowed_packet`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_max_allowed_packet) bytes as
  needed. The result buffer shrinks to
  [`net_buffer_length`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_net_buffer_length) after each
  SQL statement.

  This variable should not normally be changed, but if you have
  very little memory, you can set it to the expected length of
  statements sent by clients. If statements exceed this length,
  the connection buffer is automatically enlarged. The maximum
  value to which
  [`net_buffer_length`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_net_buffer_length) can be set

  This variable was used in MySQL 4.0 to turn on some 4.1
  behaviors, and is retained for backward compatibility. Its
  value is always `OFF`.

  This variable is deprecated as of MySQL 8.0.35, and is subject
  to removal in a future release.

  In NDB Cluster, setting this variable to `ON`
  makes it possible to employ partitioning types other than
  `KEY` or `LINEAR KEY` with
  [`NDB`](mysql-cluster.md "Chapter 25 MySQL NDB Cluster 8.0") tables. This experimental
  feature is not supported in production, and is now deprecated
  and thus subject to removal in a future release. For

  In offline mode, the MySQL instance disconnects client users
  unless they have relevant privileges, and does not allow them
  to initiate new connections. Clients that are refused access
  receive an
  [`ER_SERVER_OFFLINE_MODE`](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/mysql-errors/8.0/en/server-error-reference.html#error_er_server_offline_mode) error.

  To put a server in offline mode, change the value of the
  [`offline_mode`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_offline_mode) system variable
  from `OFF` to `ON`. To
  resume normal operations, change
  [`offline_mode`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_offline_mode)
  from `ON` to `OFF`. To
  control offline mode, an administrator account must have the
  [`SYSTEM_VARIABLES_ADMIN`](privileges-provided.md#priv_system-variables-admin)
  privilege and the
  [`CONNECTION_ADMIN`](privileges-provided.md#priv_connection-admin) privilege (or
  the deprecated [`SUPER`](privileges-provided.md#priv_super) privilege,
  which covers both these privileges).
  [`CONNECTION_ADMIN`](privileges-provided.md#priv_connection-admin) is required
  from MySQL 8.0.31 and recommended in all releases to prevent
  accidental lockout.

  Offline mode has these characteristics:

  - Connected client users who do not have the
    [`CONNECTION_ADMIN`](privileges-provided.md#priv_connection-admin) privilege
    (or the deprecated [`SUPER`](privileges-provided.md#priv_super)
    privilege) are disconnected on the next request, with an
    appropriate error. Disconnection includes terminating
    running statements and releasing locks. Such clients also
    cannot initiate new connections, and receive an
    appropriate error.
  - Connected client users who have the
    [`CONNECTION_ADMIN`](privileges-provided.md#priv_connection-admin) or
    [`SUPER`](privileges-provided.md#priv_super) privilege are not
    disconnected, and can initiate new connections to manage
    the server.
  - From MySQL 8.0.30, if the user that puts a server in
    offline mode does not have the
    [`SYSTEM_USER`](privileges-provided.md#priv_system-user) privilege,
    connected client users who have the
    [`SYSTEM_USER`](privileges-provided.md#priv_system-user) privilege are
    also not disconnected. However, these users cannot
    initiate new connections to the server while it is in
    offline mode, unless they have the
    [`CONNECTION_ADMIN`](privileges-provided.md#priv_connection-admin) or
    [`SUPER`](privileges-provided.md#priv_super)
    privilege as well. It is only their existing connection
    that cannot be terminated, because the
    [`SYSTEM_USER`](privileges-provided.md#priv_system-user) privilege is
    required to kill a session or statement that is executing
    with the [`SYSTEM_USER`](privileges-provided.md#priv_system-user)
    privilege.

  | Dynamic | No |
  | [`SET_VAR`](optimizer-hints.md#optimizer-hints-set-var "Variable-Setting Hint Syntax") Hint Applies | No |
  | Type | Boolean |
  | Default Value | `OFF` |

  [`old`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_old) is a compatibility
  variable. It is disabled by default, but can be enabled at
  startup to revert the server to behaviors present in older
  versions.

  When [`old`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_old) is enabled, it
  changes the default scope of index hints to that used prior to
  MySQL 5.1.17. That is, index hints with no
  `FOR` clause apply only to how indexes are
  used for row retrieval and not to resolution of `ORDER
  BY` or `GROUP BY` clauses. (See
  [Section 10.9.4, “Index Hints”](index-hints.md "10.9.4 Index Hints").) Take care about enabling this
  in a replication setup. With statement-based binary logging,
  having different modes for the source and replicas might lead
  to replication errors.

  This variable is deprecated as of MySQL 8.0.35, and is subject
  to removal in a future release.

  | [`SET_VAR`](optimizer-hints.md#optimizer-hints-set-var "Variable-Setting Hint Syntax") Hint Applies | No |
  | Type | Boolean |
  | Default Value | `OFF` |

  When this variable is enabled, the server does not use the
  optimized method of processing an [`ALTER
  TABLE`](alter-table.md "15.1.9 ALTER TABLE Statement") operation. It reverts to using a temporary
  table, copying over the data, and then renaming the temporary
  table to the original, as used by MySQL 5.0 and earlier. For
  more information on the operation of
  [`ALTER TABLE`](alter-table.md "15.1.9 ALTER TABLE Statement"), see
  [Section 15.1.9, “ALTER TABLE Statement”](alter-table.md "15.1.9 ALTER TABLE Statement").

  `ALTER TABLE ... DROP PARTITION` with
  [`old_alter_table=ON`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_old_alter_table) rebuilds
  the partitioned table and attempts to move data from the
  dropped partition to another partition with a compatible
  `PARTITION ... VALUES` definition. Data that
  cannot be moved to another partition is deleted. In earlier
  releases, `ALTER TABLE ... DROP PARTITION`
  with [`old_alter_table=ON`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_old_alter_table)
  deletes data stored in the partition and drops the partition.
- [`open_files_limit`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_open_files_limit)

  | Minimum Value | `0` |
  | Maximum Value | `platform dependent` |

  The number of file descriptors available to
  [**mysqld**](mysqld.md "6.3.1 mysqld — The MySQL Server") from the operating system:

  - At startup, [**mysqld**](mysqld.md "6.3.1 mysqld — The MySQL Server") reserves descriptors
    with `setrlimit()`, using the value
    requested at by setting this variable directly or by using
    the [`--open-files-limit`](mysqld-safe.md#option_mysqld_safe_open-files-limit)
    option to [**mysqld\_safe**](mysqld-safe.md "6.3.2 mysqld_safe — MySQL Server Startup Script"). If
    [**mysqld**](mysqld.md "6.3.1 mysqld — The MySQL Server") produces the error `Too
    many open files`, try increasing the
    [`open_files_limit`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_open_files_limit) value.
    Internally, the maximum value for this variable is the
    maximum unsigned integer value, but the actual maximum is
    platform dependent.
  - At runtime, the value of
    [`open_files_limit`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_open_files_limit)
    indicates the number of file descriptors actually
    permitted to [**mysqld**](mysqld.md "6.3.1 mysqld — The MySQL Server") by the operating
    system, which might differ from the value requested at
    startup. If the number of file descriptors requested
    during startup cannot be allocated,
    [**mysqld**](mysqld.md "6.3.1 mysqld — The MySQL Server") writes a warning to the error
    log.

  The effective
  [`open_files_limit`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_open_files_limit) value is
  based on the value specified at system startup (if any) and
  the values of [`max_connections`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_max_connections)
  and [`table_open_cache`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_table_open_cache), using
  these formulas:

  - `10 + max_connections + (table_open_cache *
    2)`. Using the defaults for these variables
    yields 8161.

    On Windows only, 2048 (the value of the C Run-Time Library
    file descriptor maximum) is added to this number. This
    totals 10209, again using the default values for the
    indicated system variables.
  - `max_connections * 5`
  - MySQL 8.0.19 and higher: The operating system limit.
  - Prior to MySQL 8.0.19:

    - The operating system limit if that limit is positive
      but not Infinity.
    - If the operating system limit is Infinity:
      `open_files_limit` value if specified
      at startup, 5000 if not.

  The server attempts to obtain the number of file descriptors
  using the maximum of those values, capped to the maximum
  unsigned integer value. If that many descriptors cannot be
  obtained, the server attempts to obtain as many as the system
  permits.

  The effective value is 0 on systems where MySQL cannot change
  the number of open files.

  On Unix, the value cannot be set greater than the value
  displayed by the **ulimit -n** command. On
  Linux systems using `systemd`, the value
  cannot be set greater than `LimitNOFILE`
  (this is `DefaultLimitNOFILE`, if
  `LimitNOFILE` is not set); otherwise, on
  Linux, the value of `open_files_limit` cannot
  exceed **ulimit -n**.

  Controls the heuristics applied during query optimization to
  prune less-promising partial plans from the optimizer search
  space. A value of 0 disables heuristics so that the optimizer
  performs an exhaustive search. A value of 1 causes the
  optimizer to prune plans based on the number of rows retrieved

  The maximum depth of search performed by the query optimizer.
  Values larger than the number of relations in a query result
  in better query plans, but take longer to generate an
  execution plan for a query. Values smaller than the number of
  relations in a query return an execution plan quicker, but the
  resulting plan may be far from being optimal. If set to 0, the
  system automatically picks a reasonable value.

  Enabling this variable makes it possible to revoke privileges
  partially. Specifically, for users who have privileges at the
  global level, [`partial_revokes`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_partial_revokes)
  enables privileges for specific schemas to be revoked while
  leaving the privileges in place for other schemas. For
  example, a user who has the global
  [`UPDATE`](privileges-provided.md#priv_update) privilege can be
  restricted from exercising this privilege on the
  `mysql` system schema. (Or, stated another
  way, the user is enabled to exercise the
  [`UPDATE`](privileges-provided.md#priv_update) privilege on all schemas
  except the `mysql` schema.) In this sense,
  the user's global [`UPDATE`](privileges-provided.md#priv_update)
  privilege is partially revoked.

  Once enabled, [`partial_revokes`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_partial_revokes)
  cannot be disabled if any account has privilege restrictions.
  If any such account exists, disabling
  [`partial_revokes`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_partial_revokes) fails:

  - For attempts to disable
    [`partial_revokes`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_partial_revokes) at
    startup, the server logs an error message and enables
    [`partial_revokes`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_partial_revokes).
  - For attempts to disable
    [`partial_revokes`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_partial_revokes) at
    runtime, an error occurs and the
    [`partial_revokes`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_partial_revokes) value
    remains unchanged.

  To disable [`partial_revokes`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_partial_revokes) in
  this case, first modify each account that has partially
  revoked privileges, either by re-granting the privileges or by
  removing the account.

  Note

  In privilege assignments, enabling
  [`partial_revokes`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_partial_revokes) causes
  MySQL to interpret occurrences of unescaped
  `_` and `%` SQL wildcard
  characters in schema names as literal characters, just as if
  they had been escaped as `\_` and
  `\%`. Because this changes how MySQL
  interprets privileges, it may be advisable to avoid
  unescaped wildcard characters in privilege assignments for
  installations where
  [`partial_revokes`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_partial_revokes) may be
  enabled.

  In addition, use of `_` and
  `%` as wildcard characters in grants is
  deprecated as of MySQL 8.0.35, and you should expect support
  for them to be removed in a future version of MySQL.

  For more information, including instructions for removing
  partial revokes, see [Section 8.2.12, “Privilege Restriction Using Partial Revokes”](partial-revokes.md "8.2.12 Privilege Restriction Using Partial Revokes").

  This variable defines the global policy for controlling reuse
  of previous passwords based on required minimum number of
  password changes. For an account password used previously,
  this variable indicates the number of subsequent account
  password changes that must occur before the password can be
  reused. If the value is 0 (the default), there is no reuse
  restriction based on number of password changes.

  Changes to this variable apply immediately to all accounts
  defined with the `PASSWORD HISTORY DEFAULT`
  option.

  The global number-of-changes password reuse policy can be
  overridden as desired for individual accounts using the
  `PASSWORD HISTORY` option of the
  [`CREATE USER`](create-user.md "15.7.1.3 CREATE USER Statement") and
  [`ALTER USER`](alter-user.md "15.7.1.1 ALTER USER Statement") statements. See

  This variable defines the global policy for controlling
  whether attempts to change an account password must specify
  the current password to be replaced.

  Changes to this variable apply immediately to all accounts
  defined with the `PASSWORD REQUIRE CURRENT
  DEFAULT` option.

  The global verification-required policy can be overridden as
  desired for individual accounts using the `PASSWORD
  REQUIRE` option of the [`CREATE

  | Maximum Value | `4294967295` |
  | Unit | days |

  This variable defines the global policy for controlling reuse
  of previous passwords based on time elapsed. For an account
  password used previously, this variable indicates the number
  of days that must pass before the password can be reused. If
  the value is 0 (the default), there is no reuse restriction
  based on time elapsed.

  Changes to this variable apply immediately to all accounts
  defined with the `PASSWORD REUSE INTERVAL
  DEFAULT` option.

  The global time-elapsed password reuse policy can be
  overridden as desired for individual accounts using the
  `PASSWORD REUSE INTERVAL` option of the
  [`CREATE USER`](create-user.md "15.7.1.3 CREATE USER Statement") and
  [`ALTER USER`](alter-user.md "15.7.1.1 ALTER USER Statement") statements. See

  | Type | Boolean |
  | Default Value | `ON` |

  Whether to load persisted configuration settings from the
  `mysqld-auto.cnf` file in the data
  directory. The server normally processes this file at startup
  after all other option files (see
  [Section 6.2.2.2, “Using Option Files”](option-files.md "6.2.2.2 Using Option Files")). Disabling
  [`persisted_globals_load`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_persisted_globals_load) causes
  the server startup sequence to skip
  `mysqld-auto.cnf`.

  To modify the contents of
  `mysqld-auto.cnf`, use the
  [`SET
  PERSIST`](set-variable.md "15.7.6.1 SET Syntax for Variable Assignment"),
  [`SET
  PERSIST_ONLY`](set-variable.md "15.7.6.1 SET Syntax for Variable Assignment"), and [`RESET

  [`SET
  PERSIST`](set-variable.md "15.7.6.1 SET Syntax for Variable Assignment") and
  [`SET
  PERSIST_ONLY`](set-variable.md "15.7.6.1 SET Syntax for Variable Assignment") enable system variables to be persisted
  to the `mysqld-auto.cnf` option file in the
  data directory (see [Section 15.7.6.1, “SET Syntax for Variable Assignment”](set-variable.md "15.7.6.1 SET Syntax for Variable Assignment")).
  Persisting system variables enables runtime configuration
  changes that affect subsequent server restarts, which is
  convenient for remote administration not requiring direct
  access to MySQL server host option files. However, some system
  variables are nonpersistible or can be persisted only under
  certain restrictive conditions.

  The
  [`persist_only_admin_x509_subject`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_persist_only_admin_x509_subject)
  system variable specifies the SSL certificate X.509 Subject
  value that users must have to be able to persist system
  variables that are persist-restricted. The default value is
  the empty string, which disables the Subject check so that
  persist-restricted system variables cannot be persisted by any
  user.

  If
  [`persist_only_admin_x509_subject`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_persist_only_admin_x509_subject)
  is nonempty, users who connect to the server using an
  encrypted connection and supply an SSL certificate with the
  designated Subject value then can use
  [`SET
  PERSIST_ONLY`](set-variable.md "15.7.6.1 SET Syntax for Variable Assignment") to persist persist-restricted system
  variables. For information about persist-restricted system
  variables and instructions for configuring MySQL to enable
  [`persist_only_admin_x509_subject`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_persist_only_admin_x509_subject),

  | Dynamic | No |
  | [`SET_VAR`](optimizer-hints.md#optimizer-hints-set-var "Variable-Setting Hint Syntax") Hint Applies | No |
  | Type | Boolean |
  | Default Value | `ON` |

  `persist_sensitive_variables_in_plaintext`
  controls whether the server is permitted to store the values
  of sensitive system variables in an unencrypted format, if
  keyring component support is not available at the time when
  [`SET
  PERSIST`](set-variable.md "15.7.6.1 SET Syntax for Variable Assignment") is used to set the value of the system
  variable. It also controls whether or not the server can start
  if the encrypted values cannot be decrypted. Note that keyring
  plugins do not support secure storage of sensitive system
  variables; a keyring component (see [Section 8.4.4, “The MySQL Keyring”](keyring.md "8.4.4 The MySQL Keyring"))
  must be enabled on the MySQL Server instance to support secure
  storage.

  The default setting, `ON`, encrypts the
  values if keyring component support is available, and persists
  them unencrypted (with a warning) if it is not. The next time
  any persisted system variable is set, if keyring support is
  available at that time, the server encrypts the values of any
  unencrypted sensitive system variables. The
  `ON` setting also allows the server to start
  if encrypted system variable values cannot be decrypted, in
  which case a warning is issued and the default values for the
  system variables are used. In that situation, their values
  cannot be changed until they can be decrypted.

  The most secure setting, `OFF`, means
  sensitive system variable values cannot be persisted if
  keyring component support is unavailable. The
  `OFF` setting also means the server does not
  start if encrypted system variable values cannot be decrypted.

  | [`SET_VAR`](optimizer-hints.md#optimizer-hints-set-var "Variable-Setting Hint Syntax") Hint Applies | No |
  | Type | File name |

  The path name of the file in which the server writes its
  process ID. The server creates the file in the data directory
  unless an absolute path name is given to specify a different
  directory. If you specify this variable, you must specify a
  value. If you do not specify this variable, MySQL uses a
  default value of
  `host_name.pid`,
  where *`host_name`* is the name of the
  host machine.

  The process ID file is used by other programs such as
  [**mysqld\_safe**](mysqld-safe.md "6.3.2 mysqld_safe — MySQL Server Startup Script") to determine the server's
  process ID. On Windows, this variable also affects the default
  error log file name. See [Section 7.4.2, “The Error Log”](error-log.md "7.4.2 The Error Log").

  | Type | Directory name |
  | Default Value | `BASEDIR/lib/plugin` |

  The path name of the plugin directory.

  If the plugin directory is writable by the server, it may be
  possible for a user to write executable code to a file in the
  directory using [`SELECT
  ... INTO DUMPFILE`](select.md "15.2.13 SELECT Statement"). This can be prevented by making
  [`plugin_dir`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_plugin_dir) read only to the
  server or by setting
  [`secure_file_priv`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_secure_file_priv) to a

  can be made safely.

  CREATE USER`](show-create-user.md "15.7.7.12 SHOW CREATE USER Statement") may contain unprintable characters that
  have adverse effects on terminal displays and in other
  environments. Enabling
  [`print_identified_with_as_hex`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_print_identified_with_as_hex)
  causes [`SHOW CREATE USER`](show-create-user.md "15.7.7.12 SHOW CREATE USER Statement") to
  display such hash values as hexadecimal strings rather than as
  regular string literals. Hash values that do not contain
  unprintable characters still display as regular string
  literals, even with this variable enabled.
- [`profiling`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_profiling)

  If set to 0 or `OFF` (the default), statement
  profiling is disabled. If set to 1 or `ON`,
  statement profiling is enabled and the
  [`SHOW PROFILE`](show-profile.md "15.7.7.30 SHOW PROFILE Statement") and
  [`SHOW PROFILES`](show-profiles.md "15.7.7.31 SHOW PROFILES Statement") statements
  provide access to profiling information. See
  [Section 15.7.7.31, “SHOW PROFILES Statement”](show-profiles.md "15.7.7.31 SHOW PROFILES Statement").

  This variable is deprecated; expect it to be removed in a
  future MySQL release.
- [`profiling_history_size`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_profiling_history_size)

  The number of statements for which to maintain profiling
  information if [`profiling`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_profiling) is
  enabled. The default value is 15. The maximum value is 100.
  Setting the value to 0 effectively disables profiling. See
  [Section 15.7.7.31, “SHOW PROFILES Statement”](show-profiles.md "15.7.7.31 SHOW PROFILES Statement").

  | Type | Set |
  | Default Value | `zlib,zstd,uncompressed` |
  | Valid Values | `zlib`  `zstd`  `uncompressed` |

  The compression algorithms that the server permits for
  incoming connections. These include connections by client
  programs and by servers participating in source/replica
  replication or Group Replication. Compression does not apply
  to connections for `FEDERATED` tables.

  [`protocol_compression_algorithms`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_protocol_compression_algorithms)
  does not control connection compression for X Protocol. See
  [Section 22.5.5, “Connection Compression with X Plugin”](x-plugin-connection-compression.md "22.5.5 Connection Compression with X Plugin") for
  information on how this operates.

  The variable value is a list of one or more comma-separated
  compression algorithm names, in any order, chosen from the
  following items (not case-sensitive):

  - `zlib`: Permit connections that use the
    `zlib` compression algorithm.
  - `zstd`: Permit connections that use the
    `zstd` compression algorithm.
  - `uncompressed`: Permit uncompressed
    connections. If this algorithm name is not included in the
    [`protocol_compression_algorithms`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_protocol_compression_algorithms)
    value, the server does not permit uncompressed
    connections. It permits only compressed connections that
    use whichever other algorithms are specified in the value,
    and there is no fallback to uncompressed connections.

  The default value of `zlib,zstd,uncompressed`
  indicates that the server permits all compression algorithms.

  | Type | Boolean |

  From MySQL 8.0.26,
  [`pseudo_replica_mode`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_pseudo_replica_mode) is used
  in place of
  [`pseudo_slave_mode`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_pseudo_slave_mode), which is
  deprecated from that release. The operation and effects are
  the same, only the terminology has changed.

  [`pseudo_replica_mode`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_pseudo_replica_mode) is for
  internal server use. It assists with the correct handling of
  transactions that originated on older or newer servers than
  the server currently processing them.
  [**mysqlbinlog**](mysqlbinlog.md "6.6.9 mysqlbinlog — Utility for Processing Binary Log Files") sets the value of
  [`pseudo_replica_mode`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_pseudo_replica_mode) to true
  before executing any SQL statements.

  Setting the session value of
  [`pseudo_replica_mode`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_pseudo_replica_mode) is a
  restricted operation. The session user must have either the
  [`REPLICATION_APPLIER`](privileges-provided.md#priv_replication-applier) privilege
  (see [Section 19.3.3, “Replication Privilege Checks”](replication-privilege-checks.md "19.3.3 Replication Privilege Checks")), or
  privileges sufficient to set restricted session variables (see
  [Section 7.1.9.1, “System Variable Privileges”](system-variable-privileges.md "7.1.9.1 System Variable Privileges")). However, note
  that the variable is not intended for users to set; it is set
  automatically by the replication infrastructure.

  [`pseudo_replica_mode`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_pseudo_replica_mode) has the
  following effects on the handling of prepared XA transactions,
  which can be attached to or detached from the handling session
  (by default, the session that issues
  [`XA START`](xa.md "15.3.8 XA Transactions")):

  - If true, and the handling session has executed an
    internal-use [`BINLOG`](binlog.md "15.7.8.1 BINLOG Statement")
    statement, XA transactions are automatically detached from
    the session as soon as the first part of the transaction
    up to [`XA
    PREPARE`](xa.md "15.3.8 XA Transactions") finishes, so they can be committed or
    rolled back by any session that has the
    [`XA_RECOVER_ADMIN`](privileges-provided.md#priv_xa-recover-admin) privilege.
  - If false, XA transactions remain attached to the handling
    session as long as that session is alive, during which
    time no other session can commit the transaction. The
    prepared transaction is only detached if the session
    disconnects or the server restarts.

  [`pseudo_replica_mode`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_pseudo_replica_mode) has the
  following effects on the
  `original_commit_timestamp` replication delay
  timestamp and the
  [`original_server_version`](replication-options-source.md#sysvar_original_server_version)
  system variable:

  - If true, transactions that do not explicitly set
    `original_commit_timestamp` or
    [`original_server_version`](replication-options-source.md#sysvar_original_server_version)
    are assumed to originate on another, unknown server, so
    the value 0, meaning unknown, is assigned to both the
    timestamp and the system variable.
  - If false, transactions that do not explicitly set
    `original_commit_timestamp` or
    [`original_server_version`](replication-options-source.md#sysvar_original_server_version)
    are assumed to originate on the current server, so the
    current timestamp and the current server's version are
    assigned to the timestamp and the system variable.

  In MySQL 8.0.14 and later,
  [`pseudo_replica_mode`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_pseudo_replica_mode) has the
  following effects on the handling of a statement that sets one
  or more unsupported (removed or unknown) SQL modes:

  - If true, the server ignores the unsupported mode and
    raises a warning.
  - If false, the server rejects the statement with
    [`ER_UNSUPPORTED_SQL_MODE`](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/mysql-errors/8.0/en/server-error-reference.html#error_er_unsupported_sql_mode).

  From MySQL 8.0.26,
  [`pseudo_slave_mode`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_pseudo_slave_mode) is
  deprecated and the alias
  [`pseudo_replica_mode`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_pseudo_replica_mode) is used
  instead. [`pseudo_slave_mode`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_pseudo_slave_mode) is
  for internal server use. It assists with the correct handling
  of transactions that originated on older or newer servers than
  the server currently processing them.
  [**mysqlbinlog**](mysqlbinlog.md "6.6.9 mysqlbinlog — Utility for Processing Binary Log Files") sets the value of
  [`pseudo_slave_mode`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_pseudo_slave_mode) to true
  before executing any SQL statements.

  Setting the session value of this system variable is a
  restricted operation. The session user must have either the
  [`REPLICATION_APPLIER`](privileges-provided.md#priv_replication-applier) privilege
  (see [Section 19.3.3, “Replication Privilege Checks”](replication-privilege-checks.md "19.3.3 Replication Privilege Checks")), or
  privileges sufficient to set restricted session variables (see
  [Section 7.1.9.1, “System Variable Privileges”](system-variable-privileges.md "7.1.9.1 System Variable Privileges")). However, note
  that the variable is not intended for users to set; it is set
  automatically by the replication infrastructure.

  See the description of the
  [`pseudo_replica_mode`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_pseudo_replica_mode) system
  variable for the effects of
  [`pseudo_slave_mode`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_pseudo_slave_mode).

  Warning

  Changing the session value of the
  [`pseudo_thread_id`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_pseudo_thread_id) system
  variable changes the value returned by the
  [`CONNECTION_ID()`](information-functions.md#function_connection-id) function.

  As of MySQL 8.0.14, setting the session value of this system
  variable is a restricted operation. The session user must have

  The allocation size in bytes of memory blocks that are
  allocated for objects created during statement parsing and
  execution. If you have problems with memory fragmentation, it
  might help to increase this parameter.

  The block size for the byte number is 1024. A value that is
  not an exact multiple of the block size is rounded down to the
  next lower multiple of the block size by MySQL Server before
  storing the value for the system variable. The parser allows
  values up to the maximum unsigned integer value for the
  platform (4294967295 or 232−1
  for a 32-bit system, 18446744073709551615 or

  *MySQL 8.0.28 and earlier*: This sets the
  size in bytes of the persistent buffer used for statement
  parsing and execution. This buffer is not freed between
  statements. If you are running complex queries, a larger
  `query_prealloc_size` value might be helpful
  in improving performance, because it can reduce the need for
  the server to perform memory allocation during query execution
  operations. You should be aware that doing this does not
  necessarily eliminate allocation completely; the server may
  still allocate memory in some situations, such as for
  operations relating to transactions, or to stored programs.

  As of MySQL 8.0.29, `query_prealloc_size` is
  deprecated, and setting it no longer has any effect; you
  should expect its removal in a future release of MySQL.

  The [`rand_seed1`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_rand_seed1) and
  [`rand_seed2`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_rand_seed2) variables exist as
  session variables only, and can be set but not read. The
  variables—but not their values—are shown in the
  output of [`SHOW VARIABLES`](show-variables.md "15.7.7.41 SHOW VARIABLES Statement").

  The purpose of these variables is to support replication of
  the [`RAND()`](mathematical-functions.md#function_rand) function. For
  statements that invoke [`RAND()`](mathematical-functions.md#function_rand),
  the source passes two values to the replica, where they are
  used to seed the random number generator. The replica uses
  these values to set the session variables
  [`rand_seed1`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_rand_seed1) and
  [`rand_seed2`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_rand_seed2) so that
  [`RAND()`](mathematical-functions.md#function_rand) on the replica generates
  the same value as on the source.

  The limit on memory consumption for the range optimizer. A
  value of 0 means “no limit.” If an execution plan
  considered by the optimizer uses the range access method but
  the optimizer estimates that the amount of memory needed for
  this method would exceed the limit, it abandons the plan and
  considers other plans. For more information, see

  | Default Value | `STRICT` |
  | Valid Values | `STRICT`  `IDEMPOTENT` |

  For internal use by [**mysqlbinlog**](mysqlbinlog.md "6.6.9 mysqlbinlog — Utility for Processing Binary Log Files"). This
  variable switches the server between
  `IDEMPOTENT` mode and
  `STRICT` mode. `IDEMPOTENT`
  mode causes suppression of duplicate-key and no-key-found
  errors in [`BINLOG`](binlog.md "15.7.8.1 BINLOG Statement") statements
  generated by [**mysqlbinlog**](mysqlbinlog.md "6.6.9 mysqlbinlog — Utility for Processing Binary Log Files"). This mode is
  useful when replaying a row-based binary log on a server that
  causes conflicts with existing data.
  [**mysqlbinlog**](mysqlbinlog.md "6.6.9 mysqlbinlog — Utility for Processing Binary Log Files") sets this mode when you specify
  the [`--idempotent`](mysqlbinlog.md#option_mysqlbinlog_idempotent) option by
  writing the following to the output:

  ```sql
  SET SESSION RBR_EXEC_MODE=IDEMPOTENT;
  ```

  As of MySQL 8.0.18, setting the session value of this system
  variable is no longer a restricted operation.

  Each thread that does a sequential scan for a
  `MyISAM` table allocates a buffer of this
  size (in bytes) for each table it scans. If you do many
  sequential scans, you might want to increase this value, which
  defaults to 131072. The value of this variable should be a
  multiple of 4KB. If it is set to a value that is not a
  multiple of 4KB, its value is rounded down to the nearest
  multiple of 4KB.

  This option is also used in the following context for all
  other storage engines with the exception of
  [`InnoDB`](innodb-storage-engine.md "Chapter 17 The InnoDB Storage Engine"):

  - For caching the indexes in a temporary file (not a
    temporary table), when sorting rows for `ORDER
    BY`.
  - For bulk insert into partitions.
  - For caching results of nested queries.

  [`read_buffer_size`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_read_buffer_size) is also used
  in one other storage engine-specific way: to determine the
  memory block size for [`MEMORY`](memory-storage-engine.md "18.3 The MEMORY Storage Engine")
  tables.

  Beginning with MySQL 8.0.22, the value of
  [`select_into_buffer_size`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_select_into_buffer_size) is
  used in place of the value of
  `read_buffer_size` for the I/O cache buffer
  used when executing
  [`SELECT INTO
  DUMPFILE`](select-into.md "15.2.13.1 SELECT ... INTO Statement") and `SELECT INTO OUTFILE`
  statements. (`read_buffer_size` is used for
  the I/O cache buffer size in all other cases.)

  operations, see [Section 10.12.3.1, “How MySQL Uses Memory”](memory-use.md "10.12.3.1 How MySQL Uses Memory").

  | Dynamic | Yes |
  | [`SET_VAR`](optimizer-hints.md#optimizer-hints-set-var "Variable-Setting Hint Syntax") Hint Applies | No |
  | Type | Boolean |
  | Default Value | `OFF` |

  If the [`read_only`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_read_only) system
  variable is enabled, the server permits no client updates
  except from users who have the
  [`CONNECTION_ADMIN`](privileges-provided.md#priv_connection-admin) privilege (or
  the deprecated [`SUPER`](privileges-provided.md#priv_super)
  privilege). This variable is disabled by default.

  The server also supports a
  [`super_read_only`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_super_read_only) system
  variable (disabled by default), which has these effects:

  - If [`super_read_only`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_super_read_only) is
    enabled, the server prohibits client updates, even from
    users who have the
    [`CONNECTION_ADMIN`](privileges-provided.md#priv_connection-admin) or
    [`SUPER`](privileges-provided.md#priv_super) privilege.
  - Setting [`super_read_only`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_super_read_only)
    to `ON` implicitly forces
    [`read_only`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_read_only) to
    `ON`.
  - Setting [`read_only`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_read_only) to
    `OFF` implicitly forces
    [`super_read_only`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_super_read_only) to
    `OFF`.

  When [`read_only`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_read_only) is enabled and
  when [`super_read_only`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_super_read_only) is
  enabled, the server still permits these operations:

  - Updates performed by replication threads, if the server is
    a replica. In replication setups, it can be useful to
    enable [`read_only`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_read_only) on
    replica servers to ensure that replicas accept updates
    only from the source server and not from clients.
  - Writes to the system table
    `mysql.gtid_executed`, which stores GTIDs
    for executed transactions that are not present in the
    current binary log file.
  - Use of [`ANALYZE TABLE`](analyze-table.md "15.7.3.1 ANALYZE TABLE Statement") or
    [`OPTIMIZE TABLE`](optimize-table.md "15.7.3.4 OPTIMIZE TABLE Statement") statements.
    The purpose of read-only mode is to prevent changes to
    table structure or contents. Analysis and optimization do
    not qualify as such changes. This means, for example, that
    consistency checks on read-only replicas can be performed
    with [**mysqlcheck**](mysqlcheck.md "6.5.3 mysqlcheck — A Table Maintenance Program")
    [`--all-databases`](mysqlcheck.md#option_mysqlcheck_all-databases)
    [`--analyze`](mysqlcheck.md#option_mysqlcheck_analyze).
  - Use of [`FLUSH STATUS`](flush.md#flush-status)
    statements, which are always written to the binary log.
  - Operations on `TEMPORARY` tables.
  - Inserts into the log tables
    (`mysql.general_log` and
    `mysql.slow_log`); see
    [Section 7.4.1, “Selecting General Query Log and Slow Query Log Output Destinations”](log-destinations.md "7.4.1 Selecting General Query Log and Slow Query Log Output Destinations").
  - Updates to Performance Schema tables, such as
    [`UPDATE`](update.md "15.2.17 UPDATE Statement") or
    [`TRUNCATE TABLE`](truncate-table.md "15.1.37 TRUNCATE TABLE Statement") operations.

  Changes to [`read_only`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_read_only) on a
  replication source server are not replicated to replica
  servers. The value can be set on a replica independent of the
  setting on the source.

  The following conditions apply to attempts to enable
  [`read_only`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_read_only) (including implicit
  attempts resulting from enabling
  [`super_read_only`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_super_read_only)):

  - The attempt fails and an error occurs if you have any
    explicit locks (acquired with [`LOCK
    TABLES`](lock-tables.md "15.3.6 LOCK TABLES and UNLOCK TABLES Statements")) or have a pending transaction.
  - The attempt blocks while other clients have any ongoing
    statement, active `LOCK TABLES WRITE`, or
    ongoing commit, until the locks are released and the
    statements and transactions end. While the attempt to
    enable [`read_only`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_read_only) is
    pending, requests by other clients for table locks or to
    begin transactions also block until
    [`read_only`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_read_only) has been set.
  - The attempt blocks if there are active transactions that
    hold metadata locks, until those transactions end.
  - [`read_only`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_read_only) can be enabled
    while you hold a global read lock (acquired with
    [`FLUSH TABLES WITH READ
    LOCK`](flush.md#flush-tables-with-read-lock)) because that does not involve table locks.

  This variable is used for reads from `MyISAM`
  tables, and, for any storage engine, for Multi-Range Read
  optimization.

  When reading rows from a `MyISAM` table in
  sorted order following a key-sorting operation, the rows are
  read through this buffer to avoid disk seeks. See
  [Section 10.2.1.16, “ORDER BY Optimization”](order-by-optimization.md "10.2.1.16 ORDER BY Optimization"). Setting the variable
  to a large value can improve `ORDER BY`
  performance by a lot. However, this is a buffer allocated for
  each client, so you should not set the global variable to a
  large value. Instead, change the session variable only from
  within those clients that need to run large queries.

  | Default Value | `OFF` |

  This variable is for internal server use by replication and
  [**mysqlbinlog**](mysqlbinlog.md "6.6.9 mysqlbinlog — Utility for Processing Binary Log Files"). It restricts DML events
  executed in the session to events encoded in row-based binary
  logging format only, and temporary tables cannot be created.
  Queries that do not respect the restrictions fail.

  Setting the session value of this system variable to
  `ON` requires no privileges. Setting the
  session value of this system variable to
  `OFF` is a restricted operation, and the
  session user must have privileges sufficient to set restricted
  session variables. See
  [Section 7.1.9.1, “System Variable Privileges”](system-variable-privileges.md "7.1.9.1 System Variable Privileges").

  | Type | Boolean |
  | Default Value | `OFF` |

  Whether client connections to the server are required to use
  some form of secure transport. When this variable is enabled,
  the server permits only TCP/IP connections encrypted using
  TLS/SSL, or connections that use a socket file (on Unix) or
  shared memory (on Windows). The server rejects nonsecure
  connection attempts, which fail with an
  [`ER_SECURE_TRANSPORT_REQUIRED`](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/mysql-errors/8.0/en/server-error-reference.html#error_er_secure_transport_required)
  error.

  This capability supplements per-account SSL requirements,
  which take precedence. For example, if an account is defined
  with `REQUIRE SSL`, enabling
  [`require_secure_transport`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_require_secure_transport) does
  not make it possible to use the account to connect using a
  Unix socket file.

  It is possible for a server to have no secure transports
  available. For example, a server on Windows supports no secure
  transports if started without specifying any SSL certificate
  or key files and with the
  [`shared_memory`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_shared_memory) system variable
  disabled. Under these conditions, attempts to enable
  [`require_secure_transport`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_require_secure_transport) at

  [`resultset_metadata`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_resultset_metadata) system
  variable to control whether the server returns result set
  metadata. Permitted values are `FULL` (return

  (return no metadata).

  For connections that are not metadata-optional, setting
  [`resultset_metadata`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_resultset_metadata) to

  This variable is used to limit the effect of data import and
  export operations, such as those performed by the
  [`LOAD DATA`](load-data.md "15.2.9 LOAD DATA Statement") and
  [`SELECT ... INTO
  OUTFILE`](select-into.md "15.2.13.1 SELECT ... INTO Statement") statements and the
  [`LOAD_FILE()`](string-functions.md#function_load-file) function. These
  operations are permitted only to users who have the
  [`FILE`](privileges-provided.md#priv_file) privilege.

  [`secure_file_priv`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_secure_file_priv) may be set
  as follows:

  - If empty, the variable has no effect. This is not a secure
    setting.
  - If set to the name of a directory, the server limits
    import and export operations to work only with files in
    that directory. The directory must exist; the server does
    not create it.
  - If set to `NULL`, the server disables
    import and export operations.

  The default value is platform specific and depends on the
  value of the [`INSTALL_LAYOUT`](source-configuration-options.md#option_cmake_install_layout)
  **CMake** option, as shown in the following
  table. To specify the default
  [`secure_file_priv`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_secure_file_priv) value
  explicitly if you are building from source, use the
  [`INSTALL_SECURE_FILE_PRIVDIR`](source-configuration-options.md#option_cmake_install_secure_file_privdir)
  **CMake** option.

  | `INSTALL_LAYOUT` Value | Default `secure_file_priv` Value |
  | --- | --- |
  | `STANDALONE` | empty |
  | `DEB`, `RPM`, `SVR4` | `/var/lib/mysql-files` |
  | Otherwise | `mysql-files` under the [`CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX`](source-configuration-options.md#option_cmake_cmake_install_prefix) value |

  The server checks the value of
  [`secure_file_priv`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_secure_file_priv) at startup
  and writes a warning to the error log if the value is
  insecure. A non-`NULL` value is considered
  insecure if it is empty, or the value is the data directory or
  a subdirectory of it, or a directory that is accessible by all
  users. If [`secure_file_priv`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_secure_file_priv) is
  set to a nonexistent path, the server writes an error message
  to the error log and exits.

  When using [`SELECT
  INTO OUTFILE`](select-into.md "15.2.13.1 SELECT ... INTO Statement") or `SELECT INTO
  DUMPFILE` to dump data into one or more files for
  backup creation, data migration, or other purposes, writes can
  often be buffered and then trigger a large burst of write I/O
  activity to the disk or other storage device and stall other
  queries that are more sensitive to latency. You can use this
  variable to control the size of the buffer used to write data
  to the storage device to determine when buffer synchronization
  should occur, and thus to prevent write stalls of the kind
  just described from occurring.

  `select_into_buffer_size` overrides any value
  set for [`read_buffer_size`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_read_buffer_size).
  (`select_into_buffer_size` and
  `read_buffer_size` have the same default,
  maximum, and minimum values.) You can also use
  [`select_into_disk_sync_delay`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_select_into_disk_sync_delay)
  to set a timeout to be observed afterwards, each time
  synchronization takes place.

  As of MySQL 8.0.27, setting the session value of this system
  variable is a restricted operation. The session user must have
  privileges sufficient to set restricted session variables. See

  Controls whether the server returns GTIDs to the client,
  enabling the client to use them to track the server state.
  Depending on the variable value, at the end of executing each
  transaction, the server’s GTIDs are captured and returned to
  the client as part of the acknowledgement. The possible values
  for [`session_track_gtids`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_session_track_gtids) are
  as follows:

  - `OFF`: The server does not return GTIDs
    to the client. This is the default.
  - `OWN_GTID`: The server returns the GTIDs
    for all transactions that were successfully committed by
    this client in its current session since the last
    acknowledgement. Typically, this is the single GTID for
    the last transaction committed, but if a single client
    request resulted in multiple transactions, the server
    returns a GTID set containing all the relevant GTIDs.
  - `ALL_GTIDS`: The server returns the
    global value of its
    [`gtid_executed`](replication-options-gtids.md#sysvar_gtid_executed) system
    variable, which it reads at a point after the transaction
    is successfully committed. As well as the GTID for the
    transaction just committed, this GTID set includes all
    transactions committed on the server by any client, and
    can include transactions committed after the point when
    the transaction currently being acknowledged was
    committed.

  [`session_track_gtids`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_session_track_gtids) cannot be
  set within transactional context.

  Controls whether the server tracks when the default schema
  (database) is set within the current session and notifies the
  client to make the schema name available.

  If the schema name tracker is enabled, name notification
  occurs each time the default schema is set, even if the new
  schema name is the same as the old.

  | Dynamic | Yes |
  | [`SET_VAR`](optimizer-hints.md#optimizer-hints-set-var "Variable-Setting Hint Syntax") Hint Applies | No |
  | Type | Boolean |
  | Default Value | `OFF` |

  Controls whether the server tracks changes to the state of the
  current session and notifies the client when state changes
  occur. Changes can be reported for these attributes of client
  session state:

  - The default schema (database).
  - Session-specific values for system variables.
  - User-defined variables.
  - Temporary tables.
  - Prepared statements.

  If the session state tracker is enabled, notification occurs
  for each change that involves tracked session attributes, even
  if the new attribute values are the same as the old. For
  example, setting a user-defined variable to its current value
  results in a notification.

  The
  [`session_track_state_change`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_session_track_state_change)
  variable controls only notification of when changes occur, not
  what the changes are. For example, state-change notifications
  occur when the default schema is set or tracked session system
  variables are assigned, but the notification does not include
  the schema name or variable values. To receive notification of
  the schema name or session system variable values, use the
  [`session_track_schema`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_session_track_schema) or
  [`session_track_system_variables`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_session_track_system_variables)
  system variable, respectively.

  Note

  Assigning a value to
  [`session_track_state_change`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_session_track_state_change)
  itself is not considered a state change and is not reported
  as such. However, if its name listed in the value of
  [`session_track_system_variables`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_session_track_system_variables),
  any assignments to it do result in notification of the new
  value.

  | Type | String |
  | Default Value | `time_zone, autocommit, character_set_client, character_set_results, character_set_connection` |

  Controls whether the server tracks assignments to session
  system variables and notifies the client of the name and value
  of each assigned variable. The variable value is a
  comma-separated list of variables for which to track
  assignments. By default, notification is enabled for
  [`time_zone`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_time_zone),
  [`autocommit`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_autocommit),
  [`character_set_client`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_character_set_client),
  [`character_set_results`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_character_set_results), and
  [`character_set_connection`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_character_set_connection).
  (The latter three variables are those affected by
  [`SET NAMES`](set-names.md "15.7.6.3 SET NAMES Statement").)

  To enable display of the Statement ID for each statement
  processed, use the `statement_id` variable.
  For example:

  ```sql
  mysql>  SET @@SESSION.session_track_system_variables='statement_id'
  mysql>  SELECT 1;
  +---+
  | 1 |
  +---+
  | 1 |
  +---+
  1 row in set (0.0006 sec)
  Statement ID: 603835
  ```

  The special value `*` causes the server to
  track assignments to all session variables. If given, this
  value must be specified by itself without specific system
  variable names. This value also enables display of the
  Statement ID for each successful statement processed.

  To disable notification of session variable assignments, set
  [`session_track_system_variables`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_session_track_system_variables)
  to the empty string.

  If session system variable tracking is enabled, notification
  occurs for all assignments to tracked session variables, even
  if the new values are the same as the old.

  | Type | Enumeration |
  | Default Value | `OFF` |
  | Valid Values | `OFF`  `STATE`  `CHARACTERISTICS` |

  Controls whether the server tracks the state and
  characteristics of transactions within the current session and
  notifies the client to make this information available. These
  [`session_track_transaction_info`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_session_track_transaction_info)
  values are permitted:

  - `OFF`: Disable transaction state
    tracking. This is the default.
  - `STATE`: Enable transaction state
    tracking without characteristics tracking. State tracking
    enables the client to determine whether a transaction is
    in progress and whether it could be moved to a different
    session without being rolled back.
  - `CHARACTERISTICS`: Enable transaction
    state tracking, including characteristics tracking.
    Characteristics tracking enables the client to determine
    how to restart a transaction in another session so that it
    has the same characteristics as in the original session.
    The following characteristics are relevant for this
    purpose:

    ```simple
    ISOLATION LEVEL
    READ ONLY
    READ WRITE
    WITH CONSISTENT SNAPSHOT
    ```

  For a client to safely relocate a transaction to another
  session, it must track not only transaction state but also
  transaction characteristics. In addition, the client must
  track the
  [`transaction_isolation`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_transaction_isolation) and
  [`transaction_read_only`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_transaction_read_only) system
  variables to correctly determine the session defaults. (To
  track these variables, list them in the value of the
  [`session_track_system_variables`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_session_track_system_variables)
  system variable.)

  The server uses this variable to determine whether to
  autogenerate RSA private/public key-pair files in the data
  directory if they do not already exist.

  At startup, the server automatically generates RSA
  private/public key-pair files in the data directory if all of
  these conditions are true: The

  system variable is enabled; no RSA options are specified; the
  RSA files are missing from the data directory. These key-pair
  files enable secure password exchange using RSA over
  unencrypted connections for accounts authenticated by the
  `sha256_password` or
  `caching_sha2_password` plugin; see
  [Section 8.4.1.3, “SHA-256 Pluggable Authentication”](sha256-pluggable-authentication.md "8.4.1.3 SHA-256 Pluggable Authentication"), and

  ```

  Output for the `COLUMN_TYPE` column of the

  if external locking is disabled. This affects only
  [`MyISAM`](myisam-storage-engine.md "18.2 The MyISAM Storage Engine") table access.

  This variable is set by the
  [`--external-locking`](server-options.md#option_mysqld_external-locking) or
  [`--skip-external-locking`](server-options.md#option_mysqld_external-locking)
  option. External locking is disabled by default.

  External locking affects only

  information, including conditions under which it can and
  cannot be used, see [Section 10.11.5, “External Locking”](external-locking.md "10.11.5 External Locking").

  Whether to resolve host names when checking client
  connections. If this variable is `OFF`,
  [**mysqld**](mysqld.md "6.3.1 mysqld — The MySQL Server") resolves host names when checking
  client connections. If it is `ON`,
  [**mysqld**](mysqld.md "6.3.1 mysqld — The MySQL Server") uses only IP numbers; in this case,
  all `Host` column values in the grant tables
  must be IP addresses. See [Section 7.1.12.3, “DNS Lookups and the Host Cache”](host-cache.md "7.1.12.3 DNS Lookups and the Host Cache").

  Depending on the network configuration of your system and the
  `Host` values for your accounts, clients may
  need to connect using an explicit
  [`--host`](connection-options.md#option_general_host) option, such as
  [`--host=127.0.0.1`](connection-options.md#option_general_host) or
  [`--host=::1`](connection-options.md#option_general_host).

  An attempt to connect to the host `127.0.0.1`
  normally resolves to the `localhost` account.
  However, this fails if the server is run with
  [`skip_name_resolve`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_skip_name_resolve) enabled. If
  you plan to do that, make sure an account exists that can
  accept a connection. For example, to be able to connect as
  `root` using
  [`--host=127.0.0.1`](connection-options.md#option_general_host) or
  [`--host=::1`](connection-options.md#option_general_host), create these
  accounts:

  ```sql

  | Type | Boolean |
  | Default Value | `OFF` |

  This variable controls whether the server permits TCP/IP
  connections. By default, it is disabled (permit TCP
  connections). If enabled, the server permits only local
  (non-TCP/IP) connections and all interaction with
  [**mysqld**](mysqld.md "6.3.1 mysqld — The MySQL Server") must be made using named pipes or
  shared memory (on Windows) or Unix socket files (on Unix).
  This option is highly recommended for systems where only local
  clients are permitted. See [Section 7.1.12.3, “DNS Lookups and the Host Cache”](host-cache.md "7.1.12.3 DNS Lookups and the Host Cache").

  Because starting the server with
  [`--skip-grant-tables`](server-options.md#option_mysqld_skip-grant-tables) disables
  authentication checks, the server also disables remote
  connections in that case by enabling
  [`skip_networking`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_skip_networking).

  | [`SET_VAR`](optimizer-hints.md#optimizer-hints-set-var "Variable-Setting Hint Syntax") Hint Applies | No |
  | Type | Boolean |
  | Default Value | `OFF` |

  This prevents people from using the [`SHOW
  DATABASES`](show-databases.md "15.7.7.14 SHOW DATABASES Statement") statement if they do not have the
  [`SHOW DATABASES`](privileges-provided.md#priv_show-databases) privilege. This
  can improve security if you have concerns about users being
  able to see databases belonging to other users. Its effect
  depends on the [`SHOW DATABASES`](privileges-provided.md#priv_show-databases)
  privilege: If the variable value is `ON`, the
  [`SHOW DATABASES`](show-databases.md "15.7.7.14 SHOW DATABASES Statement") statement is
  permitted only to users who have the [`SHOW
  DATABASES`](privileges-provided.md#priv_show-databases) privilege, and the statement displays all
  database names. If the value is `OFF`,
  [`SHOW DATABASES`](show-databases.md "15.7.7.14 SHOW DATABASES Statement") is permitted to
  all users, but displays the names of only those databases for
  which the user has the [`SHOW
  DATABASES`](privileges-provided.md#priv_show-databases) or other privilege.

  Caution

  Because any static global privilege is considered a
  privilege for all databases, any static global privilege
  enables a user to see all database names with
  [`SHOW DATABASES`](show-databases.md "15.7.7.14 SHOW DATABASES Statement") or by
  examining the [`SCHEMATA`](information-schema-schemata-table.md "28.3.31 The INFORMATION_SCHEMA SCHEMATA Table") table of
  `INFORMATION_SCHEMA`, except databases that
  have been restricted at the database level by partial
  revokes.

  | [`SET_VAR`](optimizer-hints.md#optimizer-hints-set-var "Variable-Setting Hint Syntax") Hint Applies | No |
  | Type | Boolean |
  | Default Value | `OFF` |

  Whether the slow query log is enabled. The value can be 0 (or
  `OFF`) to disable the log or 1 (or
  `ON`) to enable the log. The destination for
  log output is controlled by the
  [`log_output`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_log_output) system variable;
  if that value is `NONE`, no log entries are
  written even if the log is enabled.

  “Slow” is determined by the value of the
  [`long_query_time`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_long_query_time) variable. See
  [Section 7.4.5, “The Slow Query Log”](slow-query-log.md "7.4.5 The Slow Query Log").

  On Unix platforms, this variable is the name of the socket
  file that is used for local client connections. The default is
  `/tmp/mysql.sock`. (For some distribution
  formats, the directory might be different, such as
  `/var/lib/mysql` for RPMs.)

  On Windows, this variable is the name of the named pipe that
  is used for local client connections. The default value is
  `MySQL` (not case-sensitive).

  | Maximum Value (Other, 32-bit platforms) | `4294967295` |
  | Unit | bytes |

  Each session that must perform a sort allocates a buffer of
  this size. [`sort_buffer_size`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_sort_buffer_size)
  is not specific to any storage engine and applies in a general
  manner for optimization. At minimum the
  [`sort_buffer_size`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_sort_buffer_size) value must
  be large enough to accommodate fifteen tuples in the sort
  buffer. Also, increasing the value of
  [`max_sort_length`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_max_sort_length) may require
  increasing the value of
  [`sort_buffer_size`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_sort_buffer_size). For more
  information, see [Section 10.2.1.16, “ORDER BY Optimization”](order-by-optimization.md "10.2.1.16 ORDER BY Optimization")

  If you see many
  [`Sort_merge_passes`](server-status-variables.md#statvar_Sort_merge_passes) per second
  in [`SHOW GLOBAL
  STATUS`](show-status.md "15.7.7.37 SHOW STATUS Statement") output, you can consider increasing the
  [`sort_buffer_size`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_sort_buffer_size) value to
  speed up `ORDER BY` or `GROUP
  BY` operations that cannot be improved with query
  optimization or improved indexing.

  The optimizer tries to work out how much space is needed but
  can allocate more, up to the limit. Setting it larger than
  required globally slows down most queries that perform sorts.
  It is best to increase it as a session setting, and only for
  the sessions that need a larger size. On Linux, there are
  thresholds of 256KB and 2MB where larger values may
  significantly slow down memory allocation, so you should
  consider staying below one of those values. Experiment to find
  the best value for your workload. See
  [Section B.3.3.5, “Where MySQL Stores Temporary Files”](temporary-files.md "B.3.3.5 Where MySQL Stores Temporary Files").

  The maximum permissible setting for
  [`sort_buffer_size`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_sort_buffer_size) is
  4GB−1. Larger values are permitted for 64-bit platforms
  (except 64-bit Windows, for which large values are truncated
  to 4GB−1 with a warning).
- [`sql_auto_is_null`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_sql_auto_is_null)

  | Scope | Global, Session |
  | Dynamic | Yes |
  | [`SET_VAR`](optimizer-hints.md#optimizer-hints-set-var "Variable-Setting Hint Syntax") Hint Applies | Yes |
  | Type | Boolean |
  | Default Value | `OFF` |

  If this variable is enabled, then after a statement that
  successfully inserts an automatically generated
  `AUTO_INCREMENT` value, you can find that
  value by issuing a statement of the following form:

  ```sql
  SELECT * FROM tbl_name WHERE auto_col IS NULL
  ```

  If the statement returns a row, the value returned is the same
  as if you invoked the
  [`LAST_INSERT_ID()`](information-functions.md#function_last-insert-id) function. For
  details, including the return value after a multiple-row
  insert, see [Section 14.15, “Information Functions”](information-functions.md "14.15 Information Functions"). If no
  `AUTO_INCREMENT` value was successfully
  inserted, the [`SELECT`](select.md "15.2.13 SELECT Statement") statement
  returns no row.

  The behavior of retrieving an
  `AUTO_INCREMENT` value by using an
  [`IS NULL`](comparison-operators.md#operator_is-null) comparison is used by
  some ODBC programs, such as Access. See
  [Obtaining Auto-Increment Values](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/connector-odbc/en/connector-odbc-usagenotes-functionality-last-insert-id.html).
  This behavior can be disabled by setting
  [`sql_auto_is_null`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_sql_auto_is_null) to
  `OFF`.

  Prior to MySQL 8.0.16, the transformation of `WHERE
  auto_col IS NULL` to
  `WHERE auto_col =
  LAST_INSERT_ID()` was performed only when the
  statement was executed, so that the value of
  `sql_auto_is_null` during execution
  determined whether the query was transformed. In MySQL 8.0.16
  and later, the transformation is performed during statement
  preparation.

  The default value of
  [`sql_auto_is_null`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_sql_auto_is_null) is
  `OFF`.
- [`sql_big_selects`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_sql_big_selects)

  | System Variable | `sql_big_selects` |
  | Scope | Global, Session |
  | Dynamic | Yes |
  | [`SET_VAR`](optimizer-hints.md#optimizer-hints-set-var "Variable-Setting Hint Syntax") Hint Applies | Yes |
  | Type | Boolean |
  | Default Value | `ON` |

  If set to `OFF`, MySQL aborts
  [`SELECT`](select.md "15.2.13 SELECT Statement") statements that are
  likely to take a very long time to execute (that is,
  statements for which the optimizer estimates that the number
  of examined rows exceeds the value of
  [`max_join_size`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_max_join_size)). This is
  useful when an inadvisable `WHERE` statement
  has been issued. The default value for a new connection is
  `ON`, which permits all
  [`SELECT`](select.md "15.2.13 SELECT Statement") statements.

  If you set the [`max_join_size`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_max_join_size)
  system variable to a value other than
  `DEFAULT`,
  [`sql_big_selects`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_sql_big_selects) is set to
  `OFF`.

  | Type | Boolean |
  | Default Value | `OFF` |

  If enabled, [`sql_buffer_result`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_sql_buffer_result)
  forces results from [`SELECT`](select.md "15.2.13 SELECT Statement")
  statements to be put into temporary tables. This helps MySQL
  free the table locks early and can be beneficial in cases
  where it takes a long time to send results to the client. The
  default value is `OFF`.

  | Dynamic | Yes |
  | [`SET_VAR`](optimizer-hints.md#optimizer-hints-set-var "Variable-Setting Hint Syntax") Hint Applies | No |
  | Type | Boolean |
  | Default Value | `OFF` |

  Whether this server adds a generated invisible primary key to
  any [`InnoDB`](innodb-storage-engine.md "Chapter 17 The InnoDB Storage Engine") table that is created
  without one.

  This variable is not replicated. In addition, even if set on
  the replica, it is ignored by replication applier threads;
  this means that, by default, a replica does not generate a
  primary key for any replicated table which, on the source, was
  created without one. In MySQL 8.0.32 and later, you can cause
  the replica to generate invisible primary keys for such tables
  by setting `REQUIRE_TABLE_PRIMARY_KEY_CHECK =
  GENERATE` as part of a [`CHANGE
  REPLICATION SOURCE TO`](change-replication-source-to.md "15.4.2.3 CHANGE REPLICATION SOURCE TO Statement") statement, optionally
  specifying a replication channel.

  This variable controls whether logging to the general query
  log is disabled for the current session (assuming that the
  general query log itself is enabled). The default value is
  `OFF` (that is, enable logging). To disable
  or enable general query logging for the current session, set
  the session [`sql_log_off`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_sql_log_off)
  variable to `ON` or `OFF`.

  Setting the session value of this system variable is a
  restricted operation. The session user must have privileges

  The current server SQL mode, which can be set dynamically. For
  details, see [Section 7.1.11, “Server SQL Modes”](sql-mode.md "7.1.11 Server SQL Modes").

  Note

  MySQL installation programs may configure the SQL mode
  during the installation process.

  If the SQL mode differs from the default or from what you
  expect, check for a setting in an option file that the
  server reads at startup.

  | Dynamic | Yes |
  | [`SET_VAR`](optimizer-hints.md#optimizer-hints-set-var "Variable-Setting Hint Syntax") Hint Applies | No |
  | Type | Boolean |

  If enabled (the default), diagnostics of
  `Note` level increment
  `warning_count` and the server records them.
  If disabled, `Note` diagnostics do not
  increment [`warning_count`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_warning_count) and
  the server does not record them. [**mysqldump**](mysqldump.md "6.5.4 mysqldump — A Database Backup Program")
  includes output to disable this variable so that reloading the
  dump file does not produce warnings for events that do not
  affect the integrity of the reload operation.

  [`SHOW CREATE DATABASE`](show-create-database.md "15.7.7.6 SHOW CREATE DATABASE Statement")
  statements. If disabled, quoting is disabled. This option is
  enabled by default so that replication works for identifiers
  that require quoting. See [Section 15.7.7.10, “SHOW CREATE TABLE Statement”](show-create-table.md "15.7.7.10 SHOW CREATE TABLE Statement"),
  and [Section 15.7.7.6, “SHOW CREATE DATABASE Statement”](show-create-database.md "15.7.7.6 SHOW CREATE DATABASE Statement").
- [`sql_require_primary_key`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_sql_require_primary_key)

  |  |  |
  | --- | --- |
  | Command-Line Format | `--sql-require-primary-key[={OFF|ON}]` |
  | Introduced | 8.0.13 |
  | System Variable | `sql_require_primary_key` |
  | Scope | Global, Session |

  | Type | Boolean |
  | Default Value | `OFF` |

  Whether statements that create new tables or alter the
  structure of existing tables enforce the requirement that
  tables have a primary key.

  Setting the session value of this system variable is a
  restricted operation. The session user must have privileges
  sufficient to set restricted session variables. See
  [Section 7.1.9.1, “System Variable Privileges”](system-variable-privileges.md "7.1.9.1 System Variable Privileges").

  Enabling this variable helps avoid performance problems in
  row-based replication that can occur when tables have no
  primary key. Suppose that a table has no primary key and an
  update or delete modifies multiple rows. On the replication
  source server, this operation can be performed using a single
  table scan but, when replicated using row-based replication,
  results in a table scan for each row to be modified on the
  replica. With a primary key, these table scans do not occur.

  [`sql_require_primary_key`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_sql_require_primary_key)
  applies to both base tables and `TEMPORARY`
  tables, and changes to its value are replicated to replica
  servers. As of MySQL 8.0.18, it applies only to storage
  engines that can participate in replication.

  When enabled,
  [`sql_require_primary_key`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_sql_require_primary_key) has
  these effects:

  - Attempts to create a new table with no primary key fail
    with an error. This includes `CREATE TABLE ...
    LIKE`. It also includes `CREATE TABLE ...
    SELECT`, unless the `CREATE
    TABLE` part includes a primary key definition.
  - Attempts to drop the primary key from an existing table
    fail with an error, with the exception that dropping the
    primary key and adding a primary key in the same
    `ALTER TABLE` statement is permitted.

    Dropping the primary key fails even if the table also
    contains a `UNIQUE NOT NULL` index.
  - Attempts to import a table with no primary key fail with
    an error.

  The `REQUIRE_TABLE_PRIMARY_KEY_CHECK` option
  of the [`CHANGE REPLICATION SOURCE
  TO`](change-replication-source-to.md "15.4.2.3 CHANGE REPLICATION SOURCE TO Statement") statement (MySQL 8.0.23 and later) or
  [`CHANGE MASTER TO`](change-master-to.md "15.4.2.1 CHANGE MASTER TO Statement") statement
  (before MySQL 8.0.23) enables a replica to select its own
  policy for primary key checks. When the option is set to
  `ON` for a replication channel, the replica
  always uses the value `ON` for the
  [`sql_require_primary_key`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_sql_require_primary_key)
  system variable in replication operations, requiring a primary
  key. When the option is set to `OFF`, the
  replica always uses the value `OFF` for the
  [`sql_require_primary_key`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_sql_require_primary_key)
  system variable in replication operations, so that a primary
  key is never required, even if the source required one. When
  the `REQUIRE_TABLE_PRIMARY_KEY_CHECK` option
  is set to `STREAM`, which is the default, the
  replica uses whatever value is replicated from the source for
  each transaction. With the `STREAM` setting
  for the `REQUIRE_TABLE_PRIMARY_KEY_CHECK`
  option, if privilege checks are in use for the replication
  channel, the `PRIVILEGE_CHECKS_USER` account
  needs privileges sufficient to set restricted session
  variables, so that it can set the session value for the
  [`sql_require_primary_key`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_sql_require_primary_key)
  system variable. With the `ON` or
  `OFF` settings, the account does not need
  these privileges. For more information, see
  [Section 19.3.3, “Replication Privilege Checks”](replication-privilege-checks.md "19.3.3 Replication Privilege Checks").

  | [`SET_VAR`](optimizer-hints.md#optimizer-hints-set-var "Variable-Setting Hint Syntax") Hint Applies | Yes |
  | Type | Boolean |
  | Default Value | `OFF` |

  If this variable is enabled,
  [`UPDATE`](update.md "15.2.17 UPDATE Statement") and
  [`DELETE`](delete.md "15.2.2 DELETE Statement") statements that do not
  use a key in the `WHERE` clause or a
  `LIMIT` clause produce an error. This makes
  it possible to catch [`UPDATE`](update.md "15.2.17 UPDATE Statement") and
  [`DELETE`](delete.md "15.2.2 DELETE Statement") statements where keys
  are not used properly and that would probably change or delete
  a large number of rows. The default value is
  `OFF`.

  For the [**mysql**](mysql.md "6.5.1 mysql — The MySQL Command-Line Client") client,
  [`sql_safe_updates`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_sql_safe_updates) can be
  enabled by using the
  [`--safe-updates`](mysql-command-options.md#option_mysql_safe-updates) option. For more
  information, see [Using Safe-Updates Mode (--safe-updates)](mysql-tips.md#safe-updates "Using Safe-Updates Mode (--safe-updates)").

  | Minimum Value | `0` |
  | Maximum Value | `18446744073709551615` |

  The maximum number of rows to return from
  [`SELECT`](select.md "15.2.13 SELECT Statement") statements. For more
  information, see [Using Safe-Updates Mode (--safe-updates)](mysql-tips.md#safe-updates "Using Safe-Updates Mode (--safe-updates)").

  The default value for a new connection is the maximum number
  of rows that the server permits per table. Typical default
  values are (232)−1 or
  (264)−1. If you have changed
  the limit, the default value can be restored by assigning a
  value of `DEFAULT`.

  If a [`SELECT`](select.md "15.2.13 SELECT Statement") has a
  `LIMIT` clause, the `LIMIT`
  takes precedence over the value of
  [`sql_select_limit`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_sql_select_limit).

  This variable controls whether single-row
  [`INSERT`](insert.md "15.2.7 INSERT Statement") statements produce an
  information string if warnings occur. The default is
  `OFF`. Set the value to `ON`
  to produce an information string.

  The path name of the Certificate Authority (CA) certificate
  file in PEM format. The file contains a list of trusted SSL
  Certificate Authorities.

  As of MySQL 8.0.16, this variable is dynamic and can be
  modified at runtime to affect the TLS context the server uses
  for new connections established after the execution of
  [`ALTER INSTANCE RELOAD TLS`](alter-instance.md#alter-instance-reload-tls) or
  after a restart if the variable value was persisted. See
  [Server-Side Runtime Configuration and Monitoring for Encrypted

  The path name of the directory that contains trusted SSL
  Certificate Authority (CA) certificate files in PEM format.
  You must run OpenSSL `rehash` on the
  directory specified by this option prior to using it. On Linux
  systems, you can invoke `rehash` like this:

  ```terminal
  $> openssl rehash path/to/directory
  ```

  On Windows platforms, you can use the
  `c_rehash` script in a command prompt, like
  this:

  ```terminal

  If the server is started with
  [`ssl_cert`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_ssl_cert) set to a certificate
  that uses any restricted cipher or cipher category, the server
  starts with support for encrypted connections disabled. For
  information about cipher restrictions, see
  [Connection Cipher Configuration](encrypted-connection-protocols-ciphers.md#encrypted-connection-cipher-configuration "Connection Cipher Configuration").

  As of MySQL 8.0.16, this variable is dynamic and can be

  | Type | String |
  | Default Value | `NULL` |

  The list of permissible encryption ciphers for connections
  that use TLS protocols up through TLSv1.2. If no cipher in the
  list is supported, encrypted connections that use these TLS
  protocols do not work.

  For greatest portability, the cipher list should be a list of
  one or more cipher names, separated by colons. The following
  example shows two cipher names separated by a colon:

  ```terminal
  [mysqld]
  ssl_cipher="DHE-RSA-AES128-GCM-SHA256:AES128-SHA"
  ```

  OpenSSL supports the syntax for specifying ciphers described
  in the OpenSSL documentation at
  <https://www.openssl.org/docs/manmaster/man1/ciphers.html>.

  For information about which encryption ciphers MySQL supports,

  Controls whether to enable FIPS mode on the server side. The
  [`ssl_fips_mode`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_ssl_fips_mode) system variable
  differs from other
  `ssl_xxx` system
  variables in that it is not used to control whether the server
  permits encrypted connections, but rather to affect which
  cryptographic operations are permitted. See
  [Section 8.8, “FIPS Support”](fips-mode.md "8.8 FIPS Support").

  These [`ssl_fips_mode`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_ssl_fips_mode) values
  are permitted:

  - `OFF` (or 0): Disable FIPS mode.
  - `ON` (or 1): Enable FIPS mode.
  - `STRICT` (or 2): Enable
    “strict” FIPS mode.

  Note

  If the OpenSSL FIPS Object Module is not available, the only
  permitted value for
  [`ssl_fips_mode`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_ssl_fips_mode) is
  `OFF`. In this case, setting
  [`ssl_fips_mode`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_ssl_fips_mode) to
  `ON` or `STRICT` at
  startup causes the server to produce an error message and
  exit.

  As of MySQL 8.0.34, this option is deprecated and made

  size of at least 2048 bits.

  If the key file is protected by a passphrase, the server
  prompts the user for the passphrase. The password must be
  given interactively; it cannot be stored in a file. If the
  passphrase is incorrect, the program continues as if it could
  not read the key.

  As of MySQL 8.0.16, this variable is dynamic and can be

  Controls whether to enable the session cache in memory on the
  server side and session-ticket generation by the server. The
  default mode is `ON` (enable session cache
  mode). A change to the
  [`ssl_session_cache_mode`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_ssl_session_cache_mode) system
  variable has an effect only after the
  [`ALTER INSTANCE RELOAD TLS`](alter-instance.md#alter-instance-reload-tls)
  statement has been executed, or after a restart if the
  variable value was persisted.

  These [`ssl_session_cache_mode`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_ssl_session_cache_mode)
  values are permitted:

  - `ON`: Enable session cache mode.
  - `OFF`: Disable session cache mode.

  The server does not advertise its support for session
  resumption if the value of this system variable is
  `OFF`. When running on OpenSSL
  1.0.`x` the session tickets are always
  generated, but the tickets are not usable when
  [`ssl_session_cache_mode`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_ssl_session_cache_mode) is
  enabled.

  The current value in effect for
  [`ssl_session_cache_mode`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_ssl_session_cache_mode) can be

  Sets a soft upper limit for the number of cached stored
  routines per connection. The value of this variable is
  specified in terms of the number of stored routines held in
  each of the two caches maintained by the MySQL Server for,
  respectively, stored procedures and stored functions.

  Whenever a stored routine is executed this cache size is
  checked before the first or top-level statement in the routine
  is parsed; if the number of routines of the same type (stored
  procedures or stored functions according to which is being
  executed) exceeds the limit specified by this variable, the
  corresponding cache is flushed and memory previously allocated
  for cached objects is freed. This allows the cache to be
  flushed safely, even when there are dependencies between
  stored routines.

  The stored procedure and stored function caches exists in
  parallel with the stored program definition cache partition of
  the [dictionary
  object cache](glossary.md#glos_dictionary_object_cache "dictionary object cache"). The stored procedure and stored function
  caches are per connection, while the stored program definition
  cache is shared. The existence of objects in the stored
  procedure and stored function caches have no dependence on the
  existence of objects in the stored program definition cache,
  and vice versa. For more information, see
  [Section 16.4, “Dictionary Object Cache”](data-dictionary-object-cache.md "16.4 Dictionary Object Cache").

  | Maximum Value | `524288` |

  Defines a limit for the number of stored program definition
  objects, both used and unused, that can be kept in the
  dictionary object cache.

  Unused stored program definition objects are only kept in the
  dictionary object cache when the number in use is less than
  the capacity defined by
  `stored_program_definition_cache`.

  A setting of 0 means that stored program definition objects
  are only kept in the dictionary object cache while they are in
  use.

  The stored program definition cache partition exists in
  parallel with the stored procedure and stored function caches
  that are configured using the
  [`stored_program_cache`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_stored_program_cache) option.

  The [`stored_program_cache`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_stored_program_cache)
  option sets a soft upper limit for the number of cached stored
  procedures or functions per connection, and the limit is
  checked each time a connection executes a stored procedure or
  function. The stored program definition cache partition, on
  the other hand, is a shared cache that stores stored program
  definition objects for other purposes. The existence of
  objects in the stored program definition cache partition has
  no dependence on the existence of objects in the stored
  procedure cache or stored function cache, and vice versa.

  | Dynamic | Yes |
  | [`SET_VAR`](optimizer-hints.md#optimizer-hints-set-var "Variable-Setting Hint Syntax") Hint Applies | No |
  | Type | Boolean |
  | Default Value | `OFF` |

  If the [`read_only`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_read_only) system
  variable is enabled, the server permits no client updates
  except from users who have the
  [`CONNECTION_ADMIN`](privileges-provided.md#priv_connection-admin) privilege (or
  the deprecated [`SUPER`](privileges-provided.md#priv_super)
  privilege). If the
  [`super_read_only`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_super_read_only) system
  variable is also enabled, the server prohibits client updates
  even from users who have
  [`CONNECTION_ADMIN`](privileges-provided.md#priv_connection-admin) or
  [`SUPER`](privileges-provided.md#priv_super). See the description of
  the [`read_only`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_read_only) system variable
  for a description of read-only mode and information about how
  [`read_only`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_read_only) and
  [`super_read_only`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_super_read_only) interact.

  Client updates prevented when
  [`super_read_only`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_super_read_only) is enabled
  include operations that do not necessarily appear to be
  updates, such as `CREATE FUNCTION` (to
  install a loadable function), `INSTALL
  PLUGIN`, and `INSTALL COMPONENT`.
  These operations are prohibited because they involve changes
  to tables in the `mysql` system schema.

  Similarly, if the Event Scheduler is enabled, enabling the
  [`super_read_only`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_super_read_only) system
  variable prevents it from updating event “last
  executed” timestamps in the `events`
  data dictionary table. This causes the Event Scheduler to stop
  the next time it tries to execute a scheduled event, after
  writing a message to the server error log. (In this situation
  the [`event_scheduler`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_event_scheduler) system
  variable does not change from `ON` to
  `OFF`. An implication is that this variable
  rejects the DBA *intent* that the Event
  Scheduler be enabled or disabled, where its actual status of
  started or stopped may be distinct.). If
  [`super_read_only`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_super_read_only) is
  subsequently disabled after being enabled, the server
  automatically restarts the Event Scheduler as needed, as of
  MySQL 8.0.26. Prior to MySQL 8.0.26, it is necessary to
  manually restart the Event Scheduler by enabling it again.

  Changes to [`super_read_only`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_super_read_only) on
  a replication source server are not replicated to replica
  servers. The value can be set on a replica independent of the
  setting on the source.

  The tag to be added to the server identifier in error log
  output written to `syslog` or the Windows
  Event Log. This variable is unavailable unless the
  `log_sink_syseventlog` error log component is
  installed. See [Section 7.4.2.8, “Error Logging to the System Log”](error-log-syslog.md "7.4.2.8 Error Logging to the System Log").

  By default, no tag is set, so the server identifier is simply
  `MySQL` on Windows, and
  `mysqld` on other platforms. If a tag value
  of *`tag`* is specified, it is appended
  to the server identifier with a leading hyphen, resulting in a
  `syslog` identifier of
  `mysqld-tag` (or
  `MySQL-tag` on
  Windows).

  On Windows, to use a tag that does not already exist, the
  server must be run from an account with Administrator
  privileges, to permit creation of a registry entry for the
  tag. Elevated privileges are not required if the tag already
  exists.

  | Dynamic | No |
  | [`SET_VAR`](optimizer-hints.md#optimizer-hints-set-var "Variable-Setting Hint Syntax") Hint Applies | No |
  | Type | String |

  The server system time zone. When the server begins executing,
  it inherits a time zone setting from the machine defaults,
  possibly modified by the environment of the account used for
  running the server or the startup script. The value is used to
  set [`system_time_zone`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_system_time_zone). To
  explicitly specify the system time zone, set the
  `TZ` environment variable or use the
  [`--timezone`](mysqld-safe.md#option_mysqld_safe_timezone) option of the
  [**mysqld\_safe**](mysqld-safe.md "6.3.2 mysqld_safe — MySQL Server Startup Script") script.

  As of MySQL 8.0.26, in addition to startup time
  initialization, if the server host time zone changes (for
  example, due to daylight saving time),
  [`system_time_zone`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_system_time_zone) reflects
  that change, which has these implications for applications:

  - Queries that reference
    [`system_time_zone`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_system_time_zone) will get
    one value before a daylight saving change and a different
    value after the change.
  - For queries that begin executing before a daylight saving
    change and end after the change, the
    [`system_time_zone`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_system_time_zone) remains
    constant within the query because the value is usually
    cached at the beginning of execution.

  The [`system_time_zone`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_system_time_zone) variable
  differs from the [`time_zone`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_time_zone)
  variable. Although they might have the same value, the latter
  variable is used to initialize the time zone for each client
  that connects. See [Section 7.1.15, “MySQL Server Time Zone Support”](time-zone-support.md "7.1.15 MySQL Server Time Zone Support").

  | Minimum Value | `400` |
  | Maximum Value | `524288` |

  The number of table definitions that can be stored in the
  table definition cache. If you use a large number of tables,
  you can create a large table definition cache to speed up
  opening of tables. The table definition cache takes less space
  and does not use file descriptors, unlike the normal table
  cache. The minimum value is 400. The default value is based on
  the following formula, capped to a limit of 2000:

  ```simple
  MIN(400 + table_open_cache / 2, 2000)
  ```

  For [`InnoDB`](innodb-storage-engine.md "Chapter 17 The InnoDB Storage Engine"), the
  [`table_definition_cache`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_table_definition_cache)
  setting acts as a soft limit for the number of table instances
  in the dictionary object cache and the number file-per-table
  tablespaces that can be open at one time.

  If the number of table instances in the dictionary object
  cache exceeds the
  [`table_definition_cache`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_table_definition_cache) limit,
  an LRU mechanism begins marking table instances for eviction
  and eventually removes them from the dictionary object cache.
  The number of open tables with cached metadata can be higher
  than the
  [`table_definition_cache`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_table_definition_cache) limit
  due to table instances with foreign key relationships, which
  are not placed on the LRU list.

  The number of file-per-table tablespaces that can be open at
  one time is limited by both the
  [`table_definition_cache`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_table_definition_cache) and
  [`innodb_open_files`](innodb-parameters.md#sysvar_innodb_open_files) settings.
  If both variables are set, the highest setting is used. If
  neither variable is set, the
  [`table_definition_cache`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_table_definition_cache)
  setting, which has a higher default value, is used. If the
  number of open tablespaces exceeds the limit defined by
  [`table_definition_cache`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_table_definition_cache) or
  [`innodb_open_files`](innodb-parameters.md#sysvar_innodb_open_files), an LRU
  mechanism searches the LRU list for tablespace files that are
  fully flushed and not currently being extended. This process
  is performed each time a new tablespace is opened. Only
  inactive tablespaces are closed.

  The table definition cache exists in parallel with the table
  definition cache partition of the
  [dictionary object
  cache](glossary.md#glos_dictionary_object_cache "dictionary object cache"). Both caches store table definitions but serve
  different parts of the MySQL server. Objects in one cache have
  no dependence on the existence of objects in the other. For
  more information, see
  [Section 16.4, “Dictionary Object Cache”](data-dictionary-object-cache.md "16.4 Dictionary Object Cache").

  encryption setting that differs from the default schema
  encryption. The check is disabled by default.

  Setting
  [`table_encryption_privilege_check`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_table_encryption_privilege_check)

  The number of open tables for all threads. Increasing this
  value increases the number of file descriptors that
  [**mysqld**](mysqld.md "6.3.1 mysqld — The MySQL Server") requires. The effective value of
  this variable is the greater of the effective value of
  [`open_files_limit`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_open_files_limit) `-
  10 -` the effective value of
  [`max_connections`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_max_connections) `/

  ```simple
  MAX(
      (open_files_limit - 10 - max_connections) / 2,
      400
     )
  ```

  You can check whether you need to increase the table cache by
  checking the [`Opened_tables`](server-status-variables.md#statvar_Opened_tables)
  status variable. If the value of
  [`Opened_tables`](server-status-variables.md#statvar_Opened_tables) is large and
  you do not use [`FLUSH TABLES`](flush.md#flush-tables)
  often (which just forces all tables to be closed and
  reopened), then you should increase the value of the
  [`table_open_cache`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_table_open_cache) variable.

  The number of open tables cache instances. To improve
  scalability by reducing contention among sessions, the open
  tables cache can be partitioned into several smaller cache
  instances of size
  [`table_open_cache`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_table_open_cache) /
  [`table_open_cache_instances`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_table_open_cache_instances) .
  A session needs to lock only one instance to access it for DML
  statements. This segments cache access among instances,
  permitting higher performance for operations that use the
  cache when there are many sessions accessing tables. (DDL
  statements still require a lock on the entire cache, but such
  statements are much less frequent than DML statements.)

  A value of 8 or 16 is recommended on systems that routinely
  use 16 or more cores. However, if you have many large triggers
  on your tables that cause a high memory load, the default
  setting for
  [`table_open_cache_instances`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_table_open_cache_instances)
  might lead to excessive memory usage. In that situation, it
  can be helpful to set
  [`table_open_cache_instances`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_table_open_cache_instances) to
  1 in order to restrict memory usage.

  [`thread_cache_size`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_thread_cache_size) threads
  there. Requests for threads are satisfied by reusing threads
  taken from the cache if possible, and only when the cache is
  empty is a new thread created. This variable can be increased
  to improve performance if you have a lot of new connections.
  Normally, this does not provide a notable performance
  improvement if you have a good thread implementation. However,
  if your server sees hundreds of connections per second you
  should normally set
  [`thread_cache_size`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_thread_cache_size) high enough
  so that most new connections use cached threads. By examining
  the difference between the
  [`Connections`](server-status-variables.md#statvar_Connections) and
  [`Threads_created`](server-status-variables.md#statvar_Threads_created) status
  variables, you can see how efficient the thread cache is. For
  details, see [Section 7.1.10, “Server Status Variables”](server-status-variables.md "7.1.10 Server Status Variables").

  The default value is based on the following formula, capped to
  a limit of 100:

  ```simple
  8 + (max_connections / 100)

  | Type | Enumeration |
  | Default Value | `one-thread-per-connection` |
  | Valid Values | `no-threads`  `one-thread-per-connection`  `loaded-dynamically` |

  The thread-handling model used by the server for connection
  threads. The permissible values are
  `no-threads` (the server uses a single thread
  to handle one connection),
  `one-thread-per-connection` (the server uses
  one thread to handle each client connection), and
  `loaded-dynamically` (set by the thread pool
  plugin when it initializes). `no-threads` is
  useful for debugging under Linux; see
  [Section 7.9, “Debugging MySQL”](debugging-mysql.md "7.9 Debugging MySQL").

  | Type | Integer |
  | Default Value | `0` |
  | Minimum Value | `0` |
  | Maximum Value | `1` |

  This variable controls which algorithm the thread pool plugin
  uses:

  - `0`: Use a conservative low-concurrency
    algorithm.
  - `1`: Use an aggressive high-currency
    algorithm which performs better with optimal thread
    counts, but performance may be degraded if the number of
    connections reaches extremely high values.

  This variable is available only if the thread pool plugin is
  enabled. See [Section 7.6.3, “MySQL Enterprise Thread Pool”](thread-pool.md "7.6.3 MySQL Enterprise Thread Pool").

  Dedicates a listener thread in each thread group to listen for
  incoming statements from connections assigned to the group.

  - `OFF`: (Default) Disables dedicated
    listener threads.
  - `ON`: Dedicates a listener thread in each
    thread group to listen for incoming statements from
    connections assigned to the group. Dedicated listener
    threads do not execute queries.

  Enabling
  [`thread_pool_dedicated_listeners`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_thread_pool_dedicated_listeners)
  is only useful when a transaction limit is defined by
  `thread_pool_max_transactions_limit`.
  Otherwise,
  [`thread_pool_dedicated_listeners`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_thread_pool_dedicated_listeners)
  should not be enabled.

  MySQL HeatWave Service introduced this variable in MySQL 8.0.23. It is
  available with MySQL Enterprise Edition from MySQL 8.0.31.

  | Maximum Value | `1` |

  This variable affects queuing of new statements prior to
  execution. If the value is 0 (false, the default), statement
  queuing uses both the low-priority and high-priority queues.
  If the value is 1 (true), queued statements always go to the
  high-priority queue.

  This variable is available only if the thread pool plugin is
  enabled. See [Section 7.6.3, “MySQL Enterprise Thread Pool”](thread-pool.md "7.6.3 MySQL Enterprise Thread Pool").

  The maximum permissible number of active (running) query
  threads per group. If the value is 0, the thread pool plugin
  uses up to as many threads as are available.

  This variable is available only if the thread pool plugin is
  enabled. See [Section 7.6.3, “MySQL Enterprise Thread Pool”](thread-pool.md "7.6.3 MySQL Enterprise Thread Pool").

  | Type | Integer |
  | Default Value | `0` |
  | Minimum Value | `0` |
  | Maximum Value | `1000000` |

  The maximum number of transactions permitted by the thread
  pool plugin. Defining a transaction limit binds a thread to a
  transaction until it commits, which helps stabilize throughput
  during high concurrency.

  The default value of 0 means that there is no transaction
  limit. The variable is dynamic but cannot be changed from 0 to
  a higher value at runtime and vice versa. A non-zero value at
  startup permits dynamic configuration at runtime. The
  [`CONNECTION_ADMIN`](privileges-provided.md#priv_connection-admin) privilege is
  required to configure
  `thread_pool_max_transactions_limit` at
  runtime.

  When you define a transaction limit, enabling
  [`thread_pool_dedicated_listeners`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_thread_pool_dedicated_listeners)
  creates a dedicated listener thread in each thread group. The
  additional dedicated listener thread consumes more resources
  and affects thread pool performance.
  [`thread_pool_dedicated_listeners`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_thread_pool_dedicated_listeners)
  should therefore be used cautiously.

  When the limit defined by
  [`thread_pool_max_transactions_limit`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_thread_pool_max_transactions_limit)
  has been reached, new connections appear to hang until one or
  more existing transactions are completed. The same occurs when
  attempting to start a new transaction on an existing
  connection. If existing connections are blocked or
  long-running, a privileged connection may be required to
  access the server to increase the limit, remove the limit, or
  kill running transactions. See
  [Privileged Connections](thread-pool-operation.md#privileged-connections "Privileged Connections").

  MySQL HeatWave Service introduced this variable in MySQL 8.0.23. It is

  | Type | Integer |
  | Default Value | `0` |
  | Minimum Value | `0` |
  | Maximum Value | `4096` |

  The maximum permitted number of unused threads in the thread
  pool. This variable makes it possible to limit the amount of
  memory used by sleeping threads.

  A value of 0 (the default) means no limit on the number of
  sleeping threads. A value of *`N`*
  where *`N`* is greater than 0 means 1
  consumer thread and *`N`*−1
  reserve threads. In this case, if a thread is ready to sleep
  but the number of sleeping threads is already at the maximum,
  the thread exits rather than going to sleep.

  A sleeping thread is either sleeping as a consumer thread or a
  reserve thread. The thread pool permits one thread to be the
  consumer thread when sleeping. If a thread goes to sleep and
  there is no existing consumer thread, it sleeps as a consumer
  thread. When a thread must be woken up, a consumer thread is
  selected if there is one. A reserve thread is selected only
  when there is no consumer thread to wake up.

  This variable is available only if the thread pool plugin is
  enabled. See [Section 7.6.3, “MySQL Enterprise Thread Pool”](thread-pool.md "7.6.3 MySQL Enterprise Thread Pool").

  | Type | Integer |
  | Default Value | `1000` |
  | Minimum Value | `0` |
  | Maximum Value | `4294967294` |
  | Unit | milliseconds |

  This variable affects statements waiting for execution in the
  low-priority queue. The value is the number of milliseconds
  before a waiting statement is moved to the high-priority
  queue. The default is 1000 (1 second).

  This variable is available only if the thread pool plugin is
  enabled. See [Section 7.6.3, “MySQL Enterprise Thread Pool”](thread-pool.md "7.6.3 MySQL Enterprise Thread Pool").
- [`thread_pool_query_threads_per_group`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_thread_pool_query_threads_per_group)

  | Scope | Global |
  | Dynamic | Yes |
  | [`SET_VAR`](optimizer-hints.md#optimizer-hints-set-var "Variable-Setting Hint Syntax") Hint Applies | No |
  | Type | Integer |
  | Default Value | `1` |
  | Minimum Value | `1` |
  | Maximum Value | `4096` |

  The maximum number of query threads permitted in a thread
  group. The maximum value is 4096, but if
  [`thread_pool_max_transactions_limit`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_thread_pool_max_transactions_limit)
  is set,
  [`thread_pool_query_threads_per_group`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_thread_pool_query_threads_per_group)
  must not exceed that value.

  The default value of 1 means there is one active query thread
  in each thread group, which works well for many loads. When
  you are using the high concurrency thread pool algorithm
  (`thread_pool_algorithm = 1`), consider
  increasing the value if you experience slower response times
  due to long-running transactions.

  The [`CONNECTION_ADMIN`](privileges-provided.md#priv_connection-admin) privilege
  is required to configure
  [`thread_pool_query_threads_per_group`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_thread_pool_query_threads_per_group)
  at runtime.

  If you decrease the value of
  [`thread_pool_query_threads_per_group`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_thread_pool_query_threads_per_group)
  at runtime, threads that are currently running user queries
  are allowed to complete, then moved to the reserve pool or
  terminated. if you increment the value at runtime and the
  thread group needs more threads, these are taken from the
  reserve pool if possible, otherwise they are created.

  This variable is available from MySQL 8.0.31 in MySQL HeatWave Service and
  MySQL Enterprise Edition.

  | Minimum Value | `1` |
  | Maximum Value (≥ 8.0.19) | `512` |
  | Maximum Value (≤ 8.0.18) | `64` |

  The number of thread groups in the thread pool. This is the
  most important parameter controlling thread pool performance.
  It affects how many statements can execute simultaneously. If
  a value outside the range of permissible values is specified,
  the thread pool plugin does not load and the server writes a
  message to the error log.

  This variable is available only if the thread pool plugin is
  enabled. See [Section 7.6.3, “MySQL Enterprise Thread Pool”](thread-pool.md "7.6.3 MySQL Enterprise Thread Pool").
- [`thread_pool_stall_limit`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_thread_pool_stall_limit)

  | [`SET_VAR`](optimizer-hints.md#optimizer-hints-set-var "Variable-Setting Hint Syntax") Hint Applies | No |
  | Type | Integer |
  | Default Value | `6` |
  | Minimum Value | `4` |
  | Maximum Value | `600` |
  | Unit | milliseconds \* 10 |

  This variable affects executing statements. The value is the
  amount of time a statement has to finish after starting to
  execute before it becomes defined as stalled, at which point
  the thread pool permits the thread group to begin executing
  another statement. The value is measured in 10 millisecond
  units, so the default of 6 means 60ms. Short wait values
  permit threads to start more quickly. Short values are also
  better for avoiding deadlock situations. Long wait values are
  useful for workloads that include long-running statements, to
  avoid starting too many new statements while the current ones
  execute.

  This variable is available only if the thread pool plugin is
  enabled. See [Section 7.6.3, “MySQL Enterprise Thread Pool”](thread-pool.md "7.6.3 MySQL Enterprise Thread Pool").
- [`thread_pool_transaction_delay`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_thread_pool_transaction_delay)

  | Dynamic | Yes |
  | [`SET_VAR`](optimizer-hints.md#optimizer-hints-set-var "Variable-Setting Hint Syntax") Hint Applies | No |
  | Type | Integer |
  | Default Value | `0` |
  | Minimum Value | `0` |
  | Maximum Value | `300000` |

  The delay period before executing a new transaction, in
  milliseconds. The maximum value is 300000 (5 minutes).

  A transaction delay can be used in cases where parallel
  transactions affect the performance of other operations due to
  resource contention. For example, if parallel transactions
  affect index creation or an online buffer pool resizing
  operation, you can configure a transaction delay to reduce
  resource contention while those operations are running.

  Worker threads sleep for the number of milliseconds specified
  by `thread_pool_transaction_delay` before
  executing a new transaction.

  The `thread_pool_transaction_delay` setting
  does not affect queries issued from a privileged connection (a
  connection assigned to the `Admin` thread
  group). These queries are not subject to a configured
  transaction delay.

  | Unit | bytes |
  | [Block Size](server-system-variables.md#system-variables-block-size "Note") | `1024` |

  The stack size for each thread. The default is large enough
  for normal operation. If the thread stack size is too small,
  it limits the complexity of the SQL statements that the server
  can handle, the recursion depth of stored procedures, and
  other memory-consuming actions.
- [`time_zone`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_time_zone)

  | Maximum Value (≥ 8.0.19) | `+14:00` |
  | Maximum Value (≤ 8.0.18) | `+13:00` |

  The current time zone. This variable is used to initialize the
  time zone for each client that connects. By default, the
  initial value of this is `'SYSTEM'` (which
  means, “use the value of
  [`system_time_zone`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_system_time_zone)”).
  The value can be specified explicitly at server startup with
  the [`--default-time-zone`](server-options.md#option_mysqld_default-time-zone) option.
  See [Section 7.1.15, “MySQL Server Time Zone Support”](time-zone-support.md "7.1.15 MySQL Server Time Zone Support").

  Note

  If set to `SYSTEM`, every MySQL function
  call that requires a time zone calculation makes a system
  library call to determine the current system time zone. This
  call may be protected by a global mutex, resulting in
  contention.
- [`timestamp`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_timestamp)

  |  |  |
  | --- | --- |
  | System Variable | `timestamp` |
  | Scope | Session |
  | Dynamic | Yes |
  | [`SET_VAR`](optimizer-hints.md#optimizer-hints-set-var "Variable-Setting Hint Syntax") Hint Applies | Yes |
  | Type | Numeric |
  | Default Value | `UNIX_TIMESTAMP()` |
  | Minimum Value | `1` |
  | Maximum Value | `2147483647` |

  Set the time for this client. This is used to get the original
  timestamp if you use the binary log to restore rows.
  *`timestamp_value`* should be a Unix
  epoch timestamp (a value like that returned by
  [`UNIX_TIMESTAMP()`](date-and-time-functions.md#function_unix-timestamp), not a value
  in `'YYYY-MM-DD
  hh:mm:ss'` format) or
  `DEFAULT`.

  Setting [`timestamp`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_timestamp) to a
  constant value causes it to retain that value until it is
  changed again. Setting
  [`timestamp`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_timestamp) to
  `DEFAULT` causes its value to be the current
  date and time as of the time it is accessed.

  [`timestamp`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_timestamp) is a
  `DOUBLE` rather than
  `BIGINT` because its value includes a
  microseconds part. The maximum value corresponds to
  `'2038-01-19 03:14:07'` UTC, the same as for
  the [`TIMESTAMP`](datetime.md "13.2.2 The DATE, DATETIME, and TIMESTAMP Types") data type.

  `SET timestamp` affects the value returned by
  [`NOW()`](date-and-time-functions.md#function_now) but not by
  [`SYSDATE()`](date-and-time-functions.md#function_sysdate). This means that
  timestamp settings in the binary log have no effect on
  invocations of [`SYSDATE()`](date-and-time-functions.md#function_sysdate). The
  server can be started with the
  [`--sysdate-is-now`](server-options.md#option_mysqld_sysdate-is-now) option to
  cause [`SYSDATE()`](date-and-time-functions.md#function_sysdate) to be a synonym
  for [`NOW()`](date-and-time-functions.md#function_now), in which case
  `SET timestamp` affects both functions.
- [`tls_ciphersuites`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_tls_ciphersuites)

  | Dynamic | Yes |
  | [`SET_VAR`](optimizer-hints.md#optimizer-hints-set-var "Variable-Setting Hint Syntax") Hint Applies | No |
  | Type | String |
  | Default Value | `NULL` |

  Which ciphersuites the server permits for encrypted
  connections that use TLSv1.3. The value is a list of zero or
  more colon-separated ciphersuite names.

  The ciphersuites that can be named for this variable depend on
  the SSL library used to compile MySQL. If this variable is not
  set, its default value is `NULL`, which means
  that the server permits the default set of ciphersuites. If
  the variable is set to the empty string, no ciphersuites are
  enabled and encrypted connections cannot be established. For
  more information, see
  [Section 8.3.2, “Encrypted Connection TLS Protocols and Ciphers”](encrypted-connection-protocols-ciphers.md "8.3.2 Encrypted Connection TLS Protocols and Ciphers").

  | Default Value (≤ 8.0.15) | `TLSv1,TLSv1.1,TLSv1.2` |

  Which protocols the server permits for encrypted connections.
  The value is a list of one or more comma-separated protocol
  names, which are not case-sensitive. The protocols that can be
  named for this variable depend on the SSL library used to
  compile MySQL. Permitted protocols should be chosen such as
  not to leave “holes” in the list. For details,
  see [Section 8.3.2, “Encrypted Connection TLS Protocols and Ciphers”](encrypted-connection-protocols-ciphers.md "8.3.2 Encrypted Connection TLS Protocols and Ciphers").

  As of MySQL 8.0.16, this variable is dynamic and can be
  modified at runtime to affect the TLS context the server uses
  for new connections. See
  [Server-Side Runtime Configuration and Monitoring for Encrypted
  Connections](using-encrypted-connections.md#using-encrypted-connections-server-side-runtime-configuration "Server-Side Runtime Configuration and Monitoring for Encrypted Connections").
  Prior to MySQL 8.0.16, this variable can be set only at server
  startup.

  Important

  - Support for the TLSv1 and TLSv1.1 connection protocols
    is removed from MySQL Server as of MySQL 8.0.28. The
    protocols were deprecated from MySQL 8.0.26. See
    [Removal of Support for the TLSv1 and TLSv1.1 Protocols](encrypted-connection-protocols-ciphers.md#encrypted-connection-deprecated-protocols "Removal of Support for the TLSv1 and TLSv1.1 Protocols")
    for more information.
  - Support for the TLSv1.3 protocol is available in MySQL
    Server as of MySQL 8.0.16, provided that MySQL Server
    was compiled using OpenSSL 1.1.1 or higher. The server
    checks the version of OpenSSL at startup, and if it is
    lower than 1.1.1, TLSv1.3 is removed from the default
    value for the system variable. In that case, the
    defaults are
    “`TLSv1,TLSv1.1,TLSv1.2`”
    up to and including MySQL 8.0.27, and
    “`TLSv1.2`” from MySQL
    8.0.28.

  | Maximum Value | `18446744073709551615` |
  | Unit | bytes |

  Defines the maximum size of internal in-memory temporary
  tables created by the `MEMORY` storage engine
  and, as of MySQL 8.0.28, the `TempTable`
  storage engine. If an internal in-memory temporary table
  exceeds this size, it is automatically converted to an on-disk
  internal temporary table.

  The [`tmp_table_size`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_tmp_table_size) variable
  does not apply to user-created `MEMORY`
  tables. User-created `TempTable` tables are
  not supported.

  When using the `MEMORY` storage engine for
  internal in-memory temporary tables, the actual size limit is
  the smaller of [`tmp_table_size`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_tmp_table_size)
  and [`max_heap_table_size`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_max_heap_table_size). The
  [`max_heap_table_size`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_max_heap_table_size) setting
  does not apply to `TempTable` tables.

  Increase the value of
  [`tmp_table_size`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_tmp_table_size) (and
  [`max_heap_table_size`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_max_heap_table_size) if
  necessary when using the `MEMORY` storage
  engine for internal in-memory temporary tables) if you do many
  advanced `GROUP BY` queries and you have lots
  of memory.

  You can compare the number of internal on-disk temporary
  tables created to the total number of internal temporary
  tables created by comparing
  [`Created_tmp_disk_tables`](server-status-variables.md#statvar_Created_tmp_disk_tables) and
  [`Created_tmp_tables`](server-status-variables.md#statvar_Created_tmp_tables) values.

  | Scope | Global |
  | Dynamic | No |
  | [`SET_VAR`](optimizer-hints.md#optimizer-hints-set-var "Variable-Setting Hint Syntax") Hint Applies | No |
  | Type | Directory name |

  The path of the directory to use for creating temporary files.
  It might be useful if your default `/tmp`
  directory resides on a partition that is too small to hold
  temporary tables. This variable can be set to a list of
  several paths that are used in round-robin fashion. Paths
  should be separated by colon characters (`:`)
  on Unix and semicolon characters (`;`) on
  Windows.

  [`tmpdir`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_tmpdir) can be a non-permanent
  location, such as a directory on a memory-based file system or
  a directory that is cleared when the server host restarts. If
  the MySQL server is acting as a replica, and you are using a
  non-permanent location for
  [`tmpdir`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_tmpdir), consider setting a
  different temporary directory for the replica using the
  [`replica_load_tmpdir`](replication-options-replica.md#sysvar_replica_load_tmpdir) or
  [`slave_load_tmpdir`](replication-options-replica.md#sysvar_slave_load_tmpdir) variable.
  For a replica, the temporary files used to replicate
  [`LOAD DATA`](load-data.md "15.2.9 LOAD DATA Statement") statements are stored
  in this directory, so with a permanent location they can
  survive machine restarts, although replication can now
  continue after a restart if the temporary files have been
  removed.

  For more information about the storage location of temporary
  files, see [Section B.3.3.5, “Where MySQL Stores Temporary Files”](temporary-files.md "B.3.3.5 Where MySQL Stores Temporary Files").

  The amount in bytes by which to increase a per-transaction
  memory pool which needs memory. See the description of
  [`transaction_prealloc_size`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_transaction_prealloc_size).
- [`transaction_isolation`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_transaction_isolation)

  |  |  |

  | Type | Enumeration |
  | Default Value | `REPEATABLE-READ` |
  | Valid Values | `READ-UNCOMMITTED`  `READ-COMMITTED`  `REPEATABLE-READ`  `SERIALIZABLE` |

  The transaction isolation level. The default is
  [`REPEATABLE-READ`](innodb-transaction-isolation-levels.md#isolevel_repeatable-read).

  The transaction isolation level has three scopes: global,
  session, and next transaction. This three-scope implementation
  leads to some nonstandard isolation-level assignment
  semantics, as described later.

  To set the global transaction isolation level at startup, use
  the [`--transaction-isolation`](server-options.md#option_mysqld_transaction-isolation)
  server option.

  At runtime, the isolation level can be set directly using the
  [`SET`](set-variable.md "15.7.6.1 SET Syntax for Variable Assignment")
  statement to assign a value to the
  [`transaction_isolation`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_transaction_isolation) system
  variable, or indirectly using the [`SET
  TRANSACTION`](set-transaction.md "15.3.7 SET TRANSACTION Statement") statement. If you set
  [`transaction_isolation`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_transaction_isolation)
  directly to an isolation level name that contains a space, the
  name should be enclosed within quotation marks, with the space
  replaced by a dash. For example, use this
  [`SET`](set-variable.md "15.7.6.1 SET Syntax for Variable Assignment")
  statement to set the global value:

  ```sql
  SET GLOBAL transaction_isolation = 'READ-COMMITTED';
  ```

  Setting the global
  [`transaction_isolation`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_transaction_isolation) value
  sets the isolation level for all subsequent sessions. Existing
  sessions are unaffected.

  To set the session or next-level
  [`transaction_isolation`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_transaction_isolation) value,
  use the
  [`SET`](set-variable.md "15.7.6.1 SET Syntax for Variable Assignment")
  statement. For most session system variables, these statements
  are equivalent ways to set the value:

  ```sql
  SET @@SESSION.var_name = value;
  SET SESSION var_name = value;
  SET var_name = value;
  SET @@var_name = value;
  ```

  As mentioned previously, the transaction isolation level has a
  next-transaction scope, in addition to the global and session
  scopes. To enable the next-transaction scope to be set,
  [`SET`](set-variable.md "15.7.6.1 SET Syntax for Variable Assignment")
  syntax for assigning session system variable values has
  nonstandard semantics for
  [`transaction_isolation`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_transaction_isolation):

  - To set the session isolation level, use any of these
    syntaxes:

    ```sql
    SET @@SESSION.transaction_isolation = value;
    SET SESSION transaction_isolation = value;
    SET transaction_isolation = value;
    ```

    For each of those syntaxes, these semantics apply:

    - Sets the isolation level for all subsequent
      transactions performed within the session.
    - Permitted within transactions, but does not affect the
      current ongoing transaction.
    - If executed between transactions, overrides any
      preceding statement that sets the next-transaction
      isolation level.
    - Corresponds to
      [`SET
      SESSION TRANSACTION ISOLATION LEVEL`](set-transaction.md "15.3.7 SET TRANSACTION Statement") (with
      the `SESSION` keyword).
  - To set the next-transaction isolation level, use this
    syntax:

    ```sql
    SET @@transaction_isolation = value;
    ```

    For that syntax, these semantics apply:

    - Sets the isolation level only for the next single
      transaction performed within the session.
    - Subsequent transactions revert to the session
      isolation level.
    - Not permitted within transactions.
    - Corresponds to
      [`SET
      TRANSACTION ISOLATION LEVEL`](set-transaction.md "15.3.7 SET TRANSACTION Statement") (without the
      `SESSION` keyword).

  For more information about [`SET
  TRANSACTION`](set-transaction.md "15.3.7 SET TRANSACTION Statement") and its relationship to the
  [`transaction_isolation`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_transaction_isolation) system
  variable, see [Section 15.3.7, “SET TRANSACTION Statement”](set-transaction.md "15.3.7 SET TRANSACTION Statement").

  | [Block Size](server-system-variables.md#system-variables-block-size "Note") | `1024` |

  There is a per-transaction memory pool from which various
  transaction-related allocations take memory. The initial size
  of the pool in bytes is
  `transaction_prealloc_size`. For every
  allocation that cannot be satisfied from the pool because it
  has insufficient memory available, the pool is increased by
  [`transaction_alloc_block_size`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_transaction_alloc_block_size)
  bytes. When the transaction ends, the pool is truncated to
  `transaction_prealloc_size` bytes. By making
  `transaction_prealloc_size` sufficiently
  large to contain all statements within a single transaction,
  you can avoid many `malloc()` calls.

  Beginning with MySQL 8.0.29,
  `transaction_prealloc_size` is deprecated;
  the initial size of the transaction memory pool is fixed, and
  setting this variable no longer has any effect. (The
  functioning of `transaction_alloc_block_size`
  is unaffected by this change.) Expect
  `transaction_prealloc_size` to be removed in
  a future release of MySQL.
- [`transaction_read_only`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_transaction_read_only)

  | Dynamic | Yes |
  | [`SET_VAR`](optimizer-hints.md#optimizer-hints-set-var "Variable-Setting Hint Syntax") Hint Applies | No |
  | Type | Boolean |
  | Default Value | `OFF` |

  The transaction access mode. The value can be
  `OFF` (read/write; the default) or
  `ON` (read only).

  The transaction access mode has three scopes: global, session,
  and next transaction. This three-scope implementation leads to
  some nonstandard access-mode assignment semantics, as
  described later.

  To set the global transaction access mode at startup, use the
  [`--transaction-read-only`](server-options.md#option_mysqld_transaction-read-only) server
  option.

  At runtime, the access mode can be set directly using the
  [`SET`](set-variable.md "15.7.6.1 SET Syntax for Variable Assignment")
  statement to assign a value to the
  [`transaction_read_only`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_transaction_read_only) system
  variable, or indirectly using the [`SET
  TRANSACTION`](set-transaction.md "15.3.7 SET TRANSACTION Statement") statement. For example, use this
  [`SET`](set-variable.md "15.7.6.1 SET Syntax for Variable Assignment")
  statement to set the global value:

  ```sql
  SET GLOBAL transaction_read_only = ON;
  ```

  Setting the global
  [`transaction_read_only`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_transaction_read_only) value
  sets the access mode for all subsequent sessions. Existing
  sessions are unaffected.

  To set the session or next-level
  [`transaction_read_only`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_transaction_read_only) value,
  use the
  [`SET`](set-variable.md "15.7.6.1 SET Syntax for Variable Assignment")
  statement. For most session system variables, these statements
  are equivalent ways to set the value:

  ```sql
  SET @@SESSION.var_name = value;
  SET SESSION var_name = value;
  SET var_name = value;
  SET @@var_name = value;
  ```

  As mentioned previously, the transaction access mode has a
  next-transaction scope, in addition to the global and session
  scopes. To enable the next-transaction scope to be set,
  [`SET`](set-variable.md "15.7.6.1 SET Syntax for Variable Assignment")
  syntax for assigning session system variable values has
  nonstandard semantics for
  [`transaction_read_only`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_transaction_read_only),

  - To set the session access mode, use any of these syntaxes:

    ```sql
    SET @@SESSION.transaction_read_only = value;
    SET SESSION transaction_read_only = value;
    SET transaction_read_only = value;
    ```

    For each of those syntaxes, these semantics apply:

    - Sets the access mode for all subsequent transactions
      performed within the session.
    - Permitted within transactions, but does not affect the
      current ongoing transaction.
    - If executed between transactions, overrides any
      preceding statement that sets the next-transaction
      access mode.
    - Corresponds to
      [`SET
      SESSION TRANSACTION {READ WRITE | READ ONLY}`](set-transaction.md "15.3.7 SET TRANSACTION Statement")
      (with the `SESSION` keyword).
  - To set the next-transaction access mode, use this syntax:

    ```sql
    SET @@transaction_read_only = value;
    ```

    For that syntax, these semantics apply:

    - Sets the access mode only for the next single
      transaction performed within the session.
    - Subsequent transactions revert to the session access
      mode.
    - Not permitted within transactions.
    - Corresponds to
      [`SET
      TRANSACTION {READ WRITE | READ ONLY}`](set-transaction.md "15.3.7 SET TRANSACTION Statement")
      (without the `SESSION` keyword).

  | Dynamic | Yes |
  | [`SET_VAR`](optimizer-hints.md#optimizer-hints-set-var "Variable-Setting Hint Syntax") Hint Applies | Yes |
  | Type | Boolean |
  | Default Value | `ON` |

  If set to 1 (the default), uniqueness checks for secondary
  indexes in `InnoDB` tables are performed. If
  set to 0, storage engines are permitted to assume that
  duplicate keys are not present in input data. If you know for
  certain that your data does not contain uniqueness violations,
  you can set this to 0 to speed up large table imports to
  `InnoDB`.

  Setting this variable to 0 does not
  *require* storage engines to ignore
  duplicate keys. An engine is still permitted to check for them
  and issue duplicate-key errors if it detects them.

  | [`SET_VAR`](optimizer-hints.md#optimizer-hints-set-var "Variable-Setting Hint Syntax") Hint Applies | Yes |
  | Type | Boolean |
  | Default Value | `1` |

  This variable controls whether updates to a view can be made
  when the view does not contain all columns of the primary key
  defined in the underlying table, if the update statement
  contains a `LIMIT` clause. (Such updates
  often are generated by GUI tools.) An update is an
  [`UPDATE`](update.md "15.2.17 UPDATE Statement") or
  [`DELETE`](delete.md "15.2.2 DELETE Statement") statement. Primary key
  here means a `PRIMARY KEY`, or a
  `UNIQUE` index in which no column can contain
  `NULL`.

  The variable can have two values:

  - `1` or `YES`: Issue a
    warning only (not an error message). This is the default
    value.
  - `0` or `NO`: Prohibit
    the update.
- [`use_secondary_engine`](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/heatwave/en/heatwave-system-variables.html#sysvar_use_secondary_engine)

  The `validate_password` component implements
  a set of system variables having names of the form
  `validate_password.xxx`.
  These variables affect password testing by that component; see
  [Section 8.4.3.2, “Password Validation Options and Variables”](validate-password-options-variables.md "8.4.3.2 Password Validation Options and Variables").
- [`version`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_version)

  The version number for the server. The value might also

  The **CMake** configuration program has a
  [`COMPILATION_COMMENT_SERVER`](source-configuration-options.md#option_cmake_compilation_comment_server)
  option that permits a comment to be specified when building
  MySQL. This variable contains the value of that comment.
  (Prior to MySQL 8.0.14,
  [`version_comment`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_version_comment) is set by the

  The number of seconds the server waits for activity on a
  noninteractive connection before closing it.

  On thread startup, the session
  [`wait_timeout`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_wait_timeout) value is
  initialized from the global
  [`wait_timeout`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_wait_timeout) value or from
  the global

  | Dynamic | Yes |
  | [`SET_VAR`](optimizer-hints.md#optimizer-hints-set-var "Variable-Setting Hint Syntax") Hint Applies | No |
  | Type | Boolean |
  | Default Value | `ON` |

  When set to `ON` (enabled), all XA
  transactions are detached (disconnected) from the connection
  (session) as part of
  [`XA
  PREPARE`](xa-statements.md "15.3.8.1 XA Transaction SQL Statements"). This means that the XA transaction can be
  committed or rolled back by another connection, even if the
  originating connection has not terminated, and this connection
  can start new transactions.

  Temporary tables cannot be used inside detached XA
  transactions.

  When this is `OFF` (disabled), an XA
  transaction is strictly associated with the same connection
  until the session disconnects. It is recommended that you
  allow it to be enabled (the default behavior) for replication.

  For more information, see [Section 15.3.8.2, “XA Transaction States”](xa-states.md "15.3.8.2 XA Transaction States").
