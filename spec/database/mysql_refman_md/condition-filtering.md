#### 10.2.1.13 Condition Filtering

In join processing, prefix rows are those rows passed from one
table in a join to the next. In general, the optimizer
attempts to put tables with low prefix counts early in the
join order to keep the number of row combinations from
increasing rapidly. To the extent that the optimizer can use
information about conditions on rows selected from one table
and passed to the next, the more accurately it can compute row
estimates and choose the best execution plan.

Without condition filtering, the prefix row count for a table
is based on the estimated number of rows selected by the
`WHERE` clause according to whichever access
method the optimizer chooses. Condition filtering enables the
optimizer to use other relevant conditions in the
`WHERE` clause not taken into account by the
access method, and thus improve its prefix row count
estimates. For example, even though there might be an
index-based access method that can be used to select rows from
the current table in a join, there might also be additional
conditions for the table in the `WHERE`
clause that can filter (further restrict) the estimate for
qualifying rows passed to the next table.

A condition contributes to the filtering estimate only if:

- It refers to the current table.
- It depends on a constant value or values from earlier
  tables in the join sequence.
- It was not already taken into account by the access
  method.

In [`EXPLAIN`](explain.md "15.8.2 EXPLAIN Statement") output, the
`rows` column indicates the row estimate for
the chosen access method, and the `filtered`
column reflects the effect of condition filtering.
`filtered` values are expressed as
percentages. The maximum value is 100, which means no
filtering of rows occurred. Values decreasing from 100
indicate increasing amounts of filtering.

The prefix row count (the number of rows estimated to be
passed from the current table in a join to the next) is the
product of the `rows` and
`filtered` values. That is, the prefix row
count is the estimated row count, reduced by the estimated
filtering effect. For example, if `rows` is
1000 and `filtered` is 20%, condition
filtering reduces the estimated row count of 1000 to a prefix
row count of 1000 × 20% = 1000 × .2 = 200.

Consider the following query:

```sql
SELECT *
  FROM employee JOIN department ON employee.dept_no = department.dept_no
  WHERE employee.first_name = 'John'
  AND employee.hire_date BETWEEN '2018-01-01' AND '2018-06-01';
```

Suppose that the data set has these characteristics:

- The `employee` table has 1024 rows.
- The `department` table has 12 rows.
- Both tables have an index on `dept_no`.
- The `employee` table has an index on
  `first_name`.
- 8 rows satisfy this condition on
  `employee.first_name`:

  ```sql
  employee.first_name = 'John'
  ```
- 150 rows satisfy this condition on
  `employee.hire_date`:

  ```sql
  employee.hire_date BETWEEN '2018-01-01' AND '2018-06-01'
  ```
- 1 row satisfies both conditions:

  ```sql
  employee.first_name = 'John'
  AND employee.hire_date BETWEEN '2018-01-01' AND '2018-06-01'
  ```

Without condition filtering,
[`EXPLAIN`](explain.md "15.8.2 EXPLAIN Statement") produces output like
this:

```none
+----+------------+--------+------------------+---------+---------+------+----------+
| id | table      | type   | possible_keys    | key     | ref     | rows | filtered |
+----+------------+--------+------------------+---------+---------+------+----------+
| 1  | employee   | ref    | name,h_date,dept | name    | const   | 8    | 100.00   |
| 1  | department | eq_ref | PRIMARY          | PRIMARY | dept_no | 1    | 100.00   |
+----+------------+--------+------------------+---------+---------+------+----------+
```

For `employee`, the access method on the
`name` index picks up the 8 rows that match a
name of `'John'`. No filtering is done
(`filtered` is 100%), so all rows are prefix
rows for the next table: The prefix row count is
`rows` × `filtered` =
8 × 100% = 8.

With condition filtering, the optimizer additionally takes
into account conditions from the `WHERE`
clause not taken into account by the access method. In this
case, the optimizer uses heuristics to estimate a filtering
effect of 16.31% for the [`BETWEEN`](comparison-operators.md#operator_between)
condition on `employee.hire_date`. As a
result, [`EXPLAIN`](explain.md "15.8.2 EXPLAIN Statement") produces output
like this:

```none
+----+------------+--------+------------------+---------+---------+------+----------+
| id | table      | type   | possible_keys    | key     | ref     | rows | filtered |
+----+------------+--------+------------------+---------+---------+------+----------+
| 1  | employee   | ref    | name,h_date,dept | name    | const   | 8    | 16.31    |
| 1  | department | eq_ref | PRIMARY          | PRIMARY | dept_no | 1    | 100.00   |
+----+------------+--------+------------------+---------+---------+------+----------+
```

Now the prefix row count is `rows` ×
`filtered` = 8 × 16.31% = 1.3, which
more closely reflects actual data set.

Normally, the optimizer does not calculate the condition
filtering effect (prefix row count reduction) for the last
joined table because there is no next table to pass rows to.
An exception occurs for
[`EXPLAIN`](explain.md "15.8.2 EXPLAIN Statement"): To provide more
information, the filtering effect is calculated for all joined
tables, including the last one.

To control whether the optimizer considers additional
filtering conditions, use the
[`condition_fanout_filter`](switchable-optimizations.md#optflag_condition-fanout-filter) flag
of the [`optimizer_switch`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_optimizer_switch)
system variable (see
[Section 10.9.2, “Switchable Optimizations”](switchable-optimizations.md "10.9.2 Switchable Optimizations")). This flag is
enabled by default but can be disabled to suppress condition
filtering (for example, if a particular query is found to
yield better performance without it).

If the optimizer overestimates the effect of condition
filtering, performance may be worse than if condition
filtering is not used. In such cases, these techniques may
help:

- If a column is not indexed, index it so that the optimizer
  has some information about the distribution of column
  values and can improve its row estimates.
- Similarly, if no column histogram information is
  available, generate a histogram (see
  [Section 10.9.6, “Optimizer Statistics”](optimizer-statistics.md "10.9.6 Optimizer Statistics")).
- Change the join order. Ways to accomplish this include
  join-order optimizer hints (see
  [Section 10.9.3, “Optimizer Hints”](optimizer-hints.md "10.9.3 Optimizer Hints")),
  `STRAIGHT_JOIN` immediately following the
  `SELECT`, and the
  `STRAIGHT_JOIN` join operator.
- Disable condition filtering for the session:

  ```sql
  SET optimizer_switch = 'condition_fanout_filter=off';
  ```

  Or, for a given query, using an optimizer hint:

  ```sql
  SELECT /*+ SET_VAR(optimizer_switch = 'condition_fanout_filter=off') */ ...
  ```
