#### 17.15.2.2 InnoDB Lock and Lock-Wait Information

Note

This section describes locking information as exposed by the
Performance Schema [`data_locks`](performance-schema-data-locks-table.md "29.12.13.1 The data_locks Table") and
[`data_lock_waits`](performance-schema-data-lock-waits-table.md "29.12.13.2 The data_lock_waits Table") tables, which
supersede the `INFORMATION_SCHEMA`
`INNODB_LOCKS` and
`INNODB_LOCK_WAITS` tables in MySQL
8.0. For similar discussion written in terms of
the older `INFORMATION_SCHEMA` tables, see
[InnoDB Lock and Lock-Wait Information](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/innodb-information-schema-understanding-innodb-locking.html),
in [MySQL 5.7 Reference Manual](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/).

When a transaction updates a row in a table, or locks it with
`SELECT FOR UPDATE`, `InnoDB`
establishes a list or queue of locks on that row. Similarly,
`InnoDB` maintains a list of locks on a table
for table-level locks. If a second transaction wants to update a
row or lock a table already locked by a prior transaction in an
incompatible mode, `InnoDB` adds a lock request
for the row to the corresponding queue. For a lock to be
acquired by a transaction, all incompatible lock requests
previously entered into the lock queue for that row or table
must be removed (which occurs when the transactions holding or
requesting those locks either commit or roll back).

A transaction may have any number of lock requests for different
rows or tables. At any given time, a transaction may request a
lock that is held by another transaction, in which case it is
blocked by that other transaction. The requesting transaction
must wait for the transaction that holds the blocking lock to
commit or roll back. If a transaction is not waiting for a lock,
it is in a `RUNNING` state. If a transaction is
waiting for a lock, it is in a `LOCK WAIT`
state. (The `INFORMATION_SCHEMA`
[`INNODB_TRX`](information-schema-innodb-trx-table.md "28.4.28 The INFORMATION_SCHEMA INNODB_TRX Table") table indicates
transaction state values.)

The Performance Schema [`data_locks`](performance-schema-data-locks-table.md "29.12.13.1 The data_locks Table")
table holds one or more rows for each `LOCK
WAIT` transaction, indicating any lock requests that
prevent its progress. This table also contains one row
describing each lock in a queue of locks pending for a given row
or table. The Performance Schema
[`data_lock_waits`](performance-schema-data-lock-waits-table.md "29.12.13.2 The data_lock_waits Table") table shows which
locks already held by a transaction are blocking locks requested
by other transactions.
