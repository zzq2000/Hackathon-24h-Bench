### 19.4.2 Handling an Unexpected Halt of a Replica

In order for replication to be resilient to unexpected halts of
the server (sometimes described as crash-safe) it must be possible
for the replica to recover its state before halting. This section
describes the impact of an unexpected halt of a replica during
replication, and how to configure a replica for the best chance of
recovery to continue replication.

After an unexpected halt of a replica, upon restart the
replication SQL thread must recover information about which
transactions have been executed already. The information required
for recovery is stored in the replica's applier metadata
repository. From MySQL 8.0, this repository is created by default
as an [`InnoDB`](innodb-storage-engine.md "Chapter 17 The InnoDB Storage Engine") table named
`mysql.slave_relay_log_info`. By using this
transactional storage engine the information is always recoverable
upon restart. Updates to the applier metadata repository are
committed together with the transactions, meaning that the
replica's progress information recorded in that repository is
always consistent with what has been applied to the database, even
in the event of an unexpected server halt. For more information on
the applier metadata repository, see
[Section 19.2.4, “Relay Log and Replication Metadata Repositories”](replica-logs.md "19.2.4 Relay Log and Replication Metadata Repositories").

DML transactions and also atomic DDL update the replication
positions in the replica's applier metadata repository in the
`mysql.slave_relay_log_info` table together with
applying the changes to the database, as an atomic operation. In
all other cases, including DDL statements that are not fully
atomic, and exempted storage engines that do not support atomic
DDL, the `mysql.slave_relay_log_info` table might
be missing updates associated with replicated data if the server
halts unexpectedly. Restoring updates in this case is a manual
process. For details on atomic DDL support in MySQL
8.0, and the resulting behavior for the replication
of certain statements, see [Section 15.1.1, “Atomic Data Definition Statement Support”](atomic-ddl.md "15.1.1 Atomic Data Definition Statement Support").

The recovery process by which a replica recovers from an
unexpected halt varies depending on the configuration of the
replica. The details of the recovery process are influenced by the
chosen method of replication, whether the replica is
single-threaded or multithreaded, and the setting of relevant
system variables. The overall aim of the recovery process is to
identify what transactions had already been applied on the
replica's database before the unexpected halt occurred, and
retrieve and apply the transactions that the replica missed
following the unexpected halt.

- For GTID-based replication, the recovery process needs the
  GTIDs of the transactions that were already received or
  committed by the replica. The missing transactions can be
  retrieved from the source using GTID auto-positioning, which
  automatically compares the source's transactions to the
  replica's transactions and identifies the missing
  transactions.
- For file position based replication, the recovery process
  needs an accurate replication SQL thread (applier) position
  showing the last transaction that was applied on the replica.
  Based on that position, the replication I/O thread (receiver)
  retrieves from the source's binary log all of the transactions
  that should be applied on the replica from that point on.

Using GTID-based replication makes it easiest to configure
replication to be resilient to unexpected halts. GTID
auto-positioning means the replica can reliably identify and
retrieve missing transactions, even if there are gaps in the
sequence of applied transactions.

The following information provides combinations of settings that
are appropriate for different types of replica to guarantee
recovery as far as this is under the control of replication.

Important

Some factors outside the control of replication can have an
impact on the replication recovery process and the overall state
of replication after the recovery process. In particular, the
settings that influence the recovery process for individual
storage engines might result in transactions being lost in the
event of an unexpected halt of a replica, and therefore
unavailable to the replication recovery process. The
[`innodb_flush_log_at_trx_commit=1`](innodb-parameters.md#sysvar_innodb_flush_log_at_trx_commit)
setting mentioned in the list below is a key setting for a
replication setup that uses [`InnoDB`](innodb-storage-engine.md "Chapter 17 The InnoDB Storage Engine")
with transactions. However, other settings specific to
[`InnoDB`](innodb-storage-engine.md "Chapter 17 The InnoDB Storage Engine") or to other storage engines,
especially those relating to flushing or synchronization, can
also have an impact. Always check for and apply recommendations
made by your chosen storage engines about crash-safe settings.

The following combination of settings on a replica is the most
resilient to unexpected halts:

- When GTID-based replication is in use
  ([`gtid_mode=ON`](replication-options-gtids.md#sysvar_gtid_mode)), set
  `SOURCE_AUTO_POSITION=1` |
  `MASTER_AUTO_POSITION=1`, which activates
  GTID auto-positioning for the connection to the source to
  automatically identify and retrieve missing transactions. This
  option is set using a [`CHANGE REPLICATION
  SOURCE TO`](change-replication-source-to.md "15.4.2.3 CHANGE REPLICATION SOURCE TO Statement") statement (from MySQL 8.0.23) or
  [`CHANGE MASTER TO`](change-master-to.md "15.4.2.1 CHANGE MASTER TO Statement") statement
  (before MySQL 8.0.23). If the replica has multiple replication
  channels, you need to set this option for each channel
  individually. For details of how GTID auto-positioning works,
  see [Section 19.1.3.3, “GTID Auto-Positioning”](replication-gtids-auto-positioning.md "19.1.3.3 GTID Auto-Positioning"). When
  file position based replication is in use,
  `SOURCE_AUTO_POSITION=1` |
  `MASTER_AUTO_POSITION=1` is not used, and
  instead the binary log position or relay log position is used
  to control where replication starts.
- From MySQL 8.0.27, when GTID-based replication is in use
  ([`gtid_mode=ON`](replication-options-gtids.md#sysvar_gtid_mode)), set
  `GTID_ONLY=1`, which makes the replica use
  only GTIDs in the recovery process, and stop persisting binary
  log and relay log file names and file positions in the
  replication metadata repositories. This option is set using a
  [`CHANGE REPLICATION SOURCE TO`](change-replication-source-to.md "15.4.2.3 CHANGE REPLICATION SOURCE TO Statement")
  statement. If the replica has multiple replication channels,
  you need to set this option for each channel individually.
  With `GTID_ONLY=1`, during recovery, the file
  position information is ignored and GTID auto-skip is used to
  skip transactions that have already been supplied, rather than
  identifying the correct file position. This strategy is more
  efficient provided that you purge relay logs using the default
  setting for [`relay_log_purge`](replication-options-replica.md#sysvar_relay_log_purge),
  which means only one relay log file needs to be inspected.
- Set [`sync_relay_log=1`](replication-options-replica.md#sysvar_sync_relay_log), which
  instructs the replication receiver thread to synchronize the
  relay log to disk after each received transaction is written
  to it. This means the replica's record of the current position
  read from the source's binary log (in the applier metadata
  repository) is never ahead of the record of transactions saved
  in the relay log. Note that although this setting is the
  safest, it is also the slowest due to the number of disk
  writes involved. With `sync_relay_log > 1`,
  or `sync_relay_log=0` (where synchronization
  is handled by the operating system), in the event of an
  unexpected halt of a replica there might be committed
  transactions that have not been synchronized to disk. Such
  transactions can cause the recovery process to fail if the
  recovering replica, based on the information it has in the
  relay log as last synchronized to disk, tries to retrieve and
  apply the transactions again instead of skipping them. Setting
  `sync_relay_log=1` is particularly important
  for a multi-threaded replica, where the recovery process fails
  if gaps in the sequence of transactions cannot be filled using
  the information in the relay log. For a single-threaded
  replica, the recovery process only needs to use the relay log
  if the relevant information is not available in the applier
  metadata repository.
- Set
  [`innodb_flush_log_at_trx_commit=1`](innodb-parameters.md#sysvar_innodb_flush_log_at_trx_commit),
  which synchronizes the [`InnoDB`](innodb-storage-engine.md "Chapter 17 The InnoDB Storage Engine")
  logs to disk before each transaction is committed. This
  setting, which is the default, ensures that
  [`InnoDB`](innodb-storage-engine.md "Chapter 17 The InnoDB Storage Engine") tables and the
  [`InnoDB`](innodb-storage-engine.md "Chapter 17 The InnoDB Storage Engine") logs are saved on disk so
  that there is no longer a requirement for the information in
  the relay log regarding the transaction. Combined with the
  setting [`sync_relay_log=1`](replication-options-replica.md#sysvar_sync_relay_log),
  this setting further ensures that the content of the
  [`InnoDB`](innodb-storage-engine.md "Chapter 17 The InnoDB Storage Engine") tables and the
  [`InnoDB`](innodb-storage-engine.md "Chapter 17 The InnoDB Storage Engine") logs is consistent with
  the content of the relay log at all times, so that purging the
  relay log files cannot cause unfillable gaps in the replica's
  history of transactions in the event of an unexpected halt.
- Set [`relay_log_info_repository =
  TABLE`](replication-options-replica.md#sysvar_relay_log_info_repository), which stores the replication SQL thread
  position in the [`InnoDB`](innodb-storage-engine.md "Chapter 17 The InnoDB Storage Engine") table
  `mysql.slave_relay_log_info`, and updates it
  together with the transaction commit to ensure a record that
  is always accurate. This setting is the default from MySQL
  8.0, and the `FILE` setting is deprecated.
  From MySQL 8.0.23, the use of the system variable itself is
  deprecated, so omit it and allow it to default. If the
  `FILE` setting is used, which was the default
  in earlier releases, the information is stored in a file in
  the data directory that is updated after the transaction has
  been applied. This creates a risk of losing synchrony with the
  source depending at which stage of processing a transaction
  the replica halts at, or even corruption of the file itself.
  With the setting
  [`relay_log_info_repository =
  FILE`](replication-options-replica.md#sysvar_relay_log_info_repository), recovery is not guaranteed.
- Set [`relay_log_recovery = ON`](replication-options-replica.md#sysvar_relay_log_recovery),
  which enables automatic relay log recovery immediately
  following server startup. This global variable defaults to
  `OFF` and is read-only at runtime, but you
  can set it to `ON` with the
  [`--relay-log-recovery`](replication-options-replica.md#sysvar_relay_log_recovery) option at
  replica startup following an unexpected halt of a replica.
  Note that this setting ignores the existing relay log files,
  in case they are corrupted or inconsistent. The relay log
  recovery process starts a new relay log file and fetches
  transactions from the source beginning at the replication SQL
  thread position recorded in the applier metadata repository.
  The previous relay log files are removed over time by the
  replica's normal purge mechanism.

For a multithreaded replica, setting
[`relay_log_recovery = ON`](replication-options-replica.md#sysvar_relay_log_recovery)
automatically handles any inconsistencies and gaps in the sequence
of transactions that have been executed from the relay log. These
gaps can occur when file position based replication is in use.
(For more details, see
[Section 19.5.1.34, “Replication and Transaction Inconsistencies”](replication-features-transaction-inconsistencies.md "19.5.1.34 Replication and Transaction Inconsistencies").)
The relay log recovery process deals with gaps using the same
method as the [`START
REPLICA UNTIL SQL_AFTER_MTS_GAPS`](start-replica.md "15.4.2.6 START REPLICA Statement") (or before MySQL
8.0.22, `START SLAVE` instead of `START
REPLICA`) statement would. When the replica reaches a
consistent gap-free state, the relay log recovery process goes on
to fetch further transactions from the source beginning at the
replication SQL thread position. When GTID-based replication is in
use, from MySQL 8.0.18 a multithreaded replica checks first
whether `MASTER_AUTO_POSITION` is set to
`ON`, and if it is, omits the step of calculating
the transactions that should be skipped or not skipped, so that
the old relay logs are not required for the recovery process.
