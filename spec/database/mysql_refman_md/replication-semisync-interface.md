#### 19.4.10.2 Configuring Semisynchronous Replication

When you install the source and replica plugins for
semisynchronous replication (see
[Section 19.4.10.1, “Installing Semisynchronous Replication”](replication-semisync-installation.md "19.4.10.1 Installing Semisynchronous Replication")), system
variables become available to control plugin behavior.

To check the current values of the status variables for
semisynchronous replication, use [`SHOW
VARIABLES`](show-variables.md "15.7.7.41 SHOW VARIABLES Statement"):

```sql
mysql> SHOW VARIABLES LIKE 'rpl_semi_sync%';
```

Beginning with MySQL 8.0.26, new versions of the source and
replica plugins are supplied, which replace the terms
“master” and “slave” with
“source” and “replica” in system
variables and status variables. If you install the new
`rpl_semi_sync_source` and
`rpl_semi_sync_replica` plugins, the new system
variables and status variables are available but the old ones
are not. If you install the old
`rpl_semi_sync_master` and
`rpl_semi_sync_slave` plugins, the old system
variables and status variables are available but the new ones
are not. You cannot have both the new and the old version of the
relevant plugin installed on an instance.

All the
`rpl_semi_sync_xxx`
system variables are described at
[Section 19.1.6.2, “Replication Source Options and Variables”](replication-options-source.md "19.1.6.2 Replication Source Options and Variables") and
[Section 19.1.6.3, “Replica Server Options and Variables”](replication-options-replica.md "19.1.6.3 Replica Server Options and Variables"). Some key system
variables are:

[`rpl_semi_sync_source_enabled`](replication-options-source.md#sysvar_rpl_semi_sync_source_enabled) or [`rpl_semi_sync_master_enabled`](replication-options-source.md#sysvar_rpl_semi_sync_master_enabled)
:   Controls whether semisynchronous replication is enabled on
    the source server. To enable or disable the plugin, set
    this variable to 1 or 0, respectively. The default is 0
    (off).

[`rpl_semi_sync_replica_enabled`](replication-options-replica.md#sysvar_rpl_semi_sync_replica_enabled) or [`rpl_semi_sync_slave_enabled`](replication-options-replica.md#sysvar_rpl_semi_sync_slave_enabled)
:   Controls whether semisynchronous replication is enabled on
    the replica.

[`rpl_semi_sync_source_timeout`](replication-options-source.md#sysvar_rpl_semi_sync_source_timeout) or [`rpl_semi_sync_master_timeout`](replication-options-source.md#sysvar_rpl_semi_sync_master_timeout)
:   A value in milliseconds that controls how long the source
    waits on a commit for acknowledgment from a replica before
    timing out and reverting to asynchronous replication. The
    default value is 10000 (10 seconds).

[`rpl_semi_sync_source_wait_for_replica_count`](replication-options-source.md#sysvar_rpl_semi_sync_source_wait_for_replica_count) or [`rpl_semi_sync_master_wait_for_slave_count`](replication-options-source.md#sysvar_rpl_semi_sync_master_wait_for_slave_count)
:   Controls the number of replica acknowledgments the source
    must receive per transaction before returning to the
    session. The default is 1, meaning that the source only
    waits for one replica to acknowledge receipt of the
    transaction's events.

The
[`rpl_semi_sync_source_wait_point`](replication-options-source.md#sysvar_rpl_semi_sync_source_wait_point)
or
[`rpl_semi_sync_master_wait_point`](replication-options-source.md#sysvar_rpl_semi_sync_master_wait_point)
system variable controls the point at which a semisynchronous
source server waits for replica acknowledgment of transaction
receipt before returning a status to the client that committed
the transaction. These values are permitted:

- `AFTER_SYNC` (the default): The source
  writes each transaction to its binary log and the replica,
  and syncs the binary log to disk. The source waits for
  replica acknowledgment of transaction receipt after the
  sync. Upon receiving acknowledgment, the source commits the
  transaction to the storage engine and returns a result to
  the client, which then can proceed.
- `AFTER_COMMIT`: The source writes each
  transaction to its binary log and the replica, syncs the
  binary log, and commits the transaction to the storage
  engine. The source waits for replica acknowledgment of
  transaction receipt after the commit. Upon receiving
  acknowledgment, the source returns a result to the client,
  which then can proceed.

The replication characteristics of these settings differ as
follows:

- With `AFTER_SYNC`, all clients see the
  committed transaction at the same time, which is after it
  has been acknowledged by the replica and committed to the
  storage engine on the source. Thus, all clients see the same
  data on the source.

  In the event of source failure, all transactions committed
  on the source have been replicated to the replica (saved to
  its relay log). An unexpected exit of the source and
  failover to the replica is lossless because the replica is
  up to date. As noted above, the source should not be reused
  after the failover.
- With `AFTER_COMMIT`, the client issuing the
  transaction gets a return status only after the server
  commits to the storage engine and receives replica
  acknowledgment. After the commit and before replica
  acknowledgment, other clients can see the committed
  transaction before the committing client.

  If something goes wrong such that the replica does not
  process the transaction, then in the event of an unexpected
  source exit and failover to the replica, it is possible for
  such clients to see a loss of data relative to what they saw
  on the source.

From MySQL 8.0.23, you can improve the performance of
semisynchronous replication by enabling the system variables
[`replication_sender_observe_commit_only`](replication-options-replica.md#sysvar_replication_sender_observe_commit_only),
which limits callbacks, and
[`replication_optimize_for_static_plugin_config`](replication-options-replica.md#sysvar_replication_optimize_for_static_plugin_config),
which adds shared locks and avoids unnecessary lock
acquisitions. These settings help as the number of replicas
increases, because contention for locks can slow down
performance. Semisynchronous replication source servers can also
get performance benefits from enabling these system variables,
because they use the same locking mechanisms as the replicas.
