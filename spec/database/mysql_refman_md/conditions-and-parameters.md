#### 15.6.7.8 Condition Handling and OUT or INOUT Parameters

If a stored procedure exits with an unhandled exception,
modified values of `OUT` and
`INOUT` parameters are not propagated back to
the caller.

If an exception is handled by a `CONTINUE` or
`EXIT` handler that contains a
[`RESIGNAL`](resignal.md "15.6.7.4 RESIGNAL Statement") statement, execution of
[`RESIGNAL`](resignal.md "15.6.7.4 RESIGNAL Statement") pops the Diagnostics
Area stack, thus signalling the exception (that is, the
information that existed before entry into the handler). If the
exception is an error, the values of `OUT` and
`INOUT` parameters are not propagated back to
the caller.
