### 25.6.9 Importing Data Into MySQL Cluster

It is common when setting up a new instance of NDB Cluster to need
to import data from an existing NDB Cluster, instance of MySQL, or
other source. This data is most often available in one or more of
the following formats:

- An SQL dump file such as produced by
  [**mysqldump**](mysqldump.md "6.5.4 mysqldump — A Database Backup Program") or [**mysqlpump**](mysqlpump.md "6.5.6 mysqlpump — A Database Backup Program").
  This can be imported using the [**mysql**](mysql.md "6.5.1 mysql — The MySQL Command-Line Client")
  client, as shown later in this section.
- A CSV file produced by [**mysqldump**](mysqldump.md "6.5.4 mysqldump — A Database Backup Program") or other
  export program. Such files can be imported into
  `NDB` using `LOAD DATA
  INFILE` in the [**mysql**](mysql.md "6.5.1 mysql — The MySQL Command-Line Client") client, or
  with the [**ndb\_import**](mysql-cluster-programs-ndb-import.md "25.5.13 ndb_import — Import CSV Data Into NDB") utility provided with
  the NDB Cluster distribution. For more information about the
  latter, see
  [Section 25.5.13, “ndb\_import — Import CSV Data Into NDB”](mysql-cluster-programs-ndb-import.md "25.5.13 ndb_import — Import CSV Data Into NDB").
- A native `NDB` backup produced using
  [`START BACKUP`](mysql-cluster-backup-using-management-client.md "25.6.8.2 Using The NDB Cluster Management Client to Create a Backup") in the
  `NDB` management client. To import a native
  backup, you must use the [**ndb\_restore**](mysql-cluster-programs-ndb-restore.md "25.5.23 ndb_restore — Restore an NDB Cluster Backup")
  program that comes as part of NDB Cluster. See
  [Section 25.5.23, “ndb\_restore — Restore an NDB Cluster Backup”](mysql-cluster-programs-ndb-restore.md "25.5.23 ndb_restore — Restore an NDB Cluster Backup"), for more
  about using this program.

When importing data from an SQL file, it is often not necessary to
enforce transactions or foreign keys, and temporarily disabling
these features can speed up the import process greatly. This can
be done using the [**mysql**](mysql.md "6.5.1 mysql — The MySQL Command-Line Client") client, either from a
client session, or by invoking it on the command line. Within a
[**mysql**](mysql.md "6.5.1 mysql — The MySQL Command-Line Client") client session, you can perform the
import using the following SQL statements:

```sql
SET ndb_use_transactions=0;
SET foreign_key_checks=0;

source path/to/dumpfile;

SET ndb_use_transactions=1;
SET foreign_key_checks=1;
```

When performing the import in this fashion, you
*must* enable
`ndb_use_transaction` and
`foreign_key_checks` again following execution of
the [**mysql**](mysql.md "6.5.1 mysql — The MySQL Command-Line Client") client's
`source` command. Otherwise, it is possible for
later statements in same session may also be executed without
enforcing transactions or foreign key constraints, and which could
lead to data inconcsistency.

From the system shell, you can import the SQL file while disabling
enforcement of transaction and foreign keys by using the
[**mysql**](mysql.md "6.5.1 mysql — The MySQL Command-Line Client") client with the
[`--init-command`](mysql-command-options.md#option_mysql_init-command) option, like this:

```sql
$> mysql --init-command='SET ndb_use_transactions=0; SET foreign_key_checks=0' < path/to/dumpfile
```

It is also possible to load the data into an
[`InnoDB`](innodb-storage-engine.md "Chapter 17 The InnoDB Storage Engine") table, and convert it to use
the NDB storage engine afterwards using ALTER TABLE ... ENGINE
NDB). You should take into account, especially for many tables,
that this may require a number of such operations; in addition, if
foreign keys are used, you must mind the order of the
`ALTER TABLE` statements carefully, due to the
fact that foreign keys do not work between tables using different
MySQL storage engines.

You should be aware that the methods described previously in this
section are not optimized for very large data sets or large
transactions. Should an application really need big transactions
or many concurrent transactions as part of normal operation, you
may wish to increase the value of the
[`MaxNoOfConcurrentOperations`](mysql-cluster-ndbd-definition.md#ndbparam-ndbd-maxnoofconcurrentoperations)
data node configuration parameter, which reserves more memory to
allow a data node to take over a transaction if its transaction
coordinator stops unexpectedly.

You may also wish to do this when performing bulk
[`DELETE`](delete.md "15.2.2 DELETE Statement") or
[`UPDATE`](update.md "15.2.17 UPDATE Statement") operations on NDB Cluster
tables. If possible, try to have applications perform these
operations in chunks, for example, by adding
`LIMIT` to such statements.

If a data import operation does not complete successfully, for
whatever reason, you should be prepared to perform any necessary
cleanup including possibly one or more [`DROP
TABLE`](drop-table.md "15.1.32 DROP TABLE Statement") statements, [`DROP
DATABASE`](drop-database.md "15.1.24 DROP DATABASE Statement") statements, or both. Failing to do so may leave
the database in an inconsistent state.
