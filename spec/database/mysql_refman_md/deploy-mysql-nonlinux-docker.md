#### 2.5.6.3 Deploying MySQL on Windows and Other Non-Linux Platforms with Docker

Warning

The MySQL Docker images provided by Oracle are built
specifically for Linux platforms. Other platforms are not
supported, and users running the MySQL Docker images from
Oracle on them are doing so at their own risk. This section
discusses some known issues for the images when used on
non-Linux platforms.

Known Issues for using the MySQL Server Docker images from
Oracle on Windows include:

- If you are bind-mounting on the container's MySQL data
  directory (see
  [Persisting Data and Configuration Changes](docker-mysql-more-topics.md#docker-persisting-data-configuration "Persisting Data and Configuration Changes") for
  details), you have to set the location of the server socket
  file with the [`--socket`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_socket) option
  to somewhere outside of the MySQL data directory; otherwise,
  the server fails to start. This is because the way Docker
  for Windows handles file mounting does not allow a host file
  from being bind-mounted on the socket file.
