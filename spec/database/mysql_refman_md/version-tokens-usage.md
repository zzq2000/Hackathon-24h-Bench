#### 7.6.6.3 Using Version Tokens

Before using Version Tokens, install it according to the
instructions provided at
[Section 7.6.6.2, “Installing or Uninstalling Version Tokens”](version-tokens-installation.md "7.6.6.2 Installing or Uninstalling Version Tokens").

A scenario in which Version Tokens can be useful is a system
that accesses a collection of MySQL servers but needs to manage
them for load balancing purposes by monitoring them and
adjusting server assignments according to load changes. Such a
system comprises these elements:

- The collection of MySQL servers to be managed.
- An administrative or management application that
  communicates with the servers and organizes them into
  high-availability groups. Groups serve different purposes,
  and servers within each group may have different
  assignments. Assignment of a server within a certain group
  can change at any time.
- Client applications that access the servers to retrieve and
  update data, choosing servers according to the purposes
  assigned them. For example, a client should not send an
  update to a read-only server.

Version Tokens permit server access to be managed according to
assignment without requiring clients to repeatedly query the
servers about their assignments:

- The management application performs server assignments and
  establishes version tokens on each server to reflect its
  assignment. The application caches this information to
  provide a central access point to it.

  If at some point the management application needs to change
  a server assignment (for example, to change it from
  permitting writes to read only), it changes the server's
  version token list and updates its cache.
- To improve performance, client applications obtain cache
  information from the management application, enabling them
  to avoid having to retrieve information about server
  assignments for each statement. Based on the type of
  statements it issues (for example, reads versus writes), a
  client selects an appropriate server and connects to it.
- In addition, the client sends to the server its own
  client-specific version tokens to register the assignment it
  requires of the server. For each statement sent by the
  client to the server, the server compares its own token list
  with the client token list. If the server token list
  contains all tokens present in the client token list with
  the same values, there is a match and the server executes
  the statement.

  On the other hand, perhaps the management application has
  changed the server assignment and its version token list. In
  this case, the new server assignment may now be incompatible
  with the client requirements. A token mismatch between the
  server and client token lists occurs and the server returns
  an error in reply to the statement. This is an indication to
  the client to refresh its version token information from the
  management application cache, and to select a new server to
  communicate with.

The client-side logic for detecting version token errors and
selecting a new server can be implemented different ways:

- The client can handle all version token registration,
  mismatch detection, and connection switching itself.
- The logic for those actions can be implemented in a
  connector that manages connections between clients and MySQL
  servers. Such a connector might handle mismatch error
  detection and statement resending itself, or it might pass
  the error to the application and leave it to the application
  to resend the statement.

The following example illustrates the preceding discussion in
more concrete form.

When Version Tokens initializes on a given server, the server's
version token list is empty. Token list maintenance is performed
by calling functions. The
[`VERSION_TOKEN_ADMIN`](privileges-provided.md#priv_version-token-admin) privilege (or
the deprecated [`SUPER`](privileges-provided.md#priv_super) privilege)
is required to call any of the Version Token functions, so token
list modification is expected to be done by a management or
administrative application that has that privilege.

Suppose that a management application communicates with a set of
servers that are queried by clients to access employee and
product databases (named `emp` and
`prod`, respectively). All servers are
permitted to process data retrieval statements, but only some of
them are permitted to make database updates. To handle this on a
database-specific basis, the management application establishes
a list of version tokens on each server. In the token list for a
given server, token names represent database names and token
values are `read` or `write`
depending on whether the database must be used in read-only
fashion or whether it can take reads and writes.

Client applications register a list of version tokens they
require the server to match by setting a system variable.
Variable setting occurs on a client-specific basis, so different
clients can register different requirements. By default, the
client token list is empty, which matches any server token list.
When a client sets its token list to a nonempty value, matching
may succeed or fail, depending on the server version token list.

To define the version token list for a server, the management
application calls the
[`version_tokens_set()`](version-tokens-reference.md#function_version-tokens-set) function.
(There are also functions for modifying and displaying the token
list, described later.) For example, the application might send
these statements to a group of three servers:

Server 1:

```sql
mysql> SELECT version_tokens_set('emp=read;prod=read');
+------------------------------------------+
| version_tokens_set('emp=read;prod=read') |
+------------------------------------------+
| 2 version tokens set.                    |
+------------------------------------------+
```

Server 2:

```sql
mysql> SELECT version_tokens_set('emp=write;prod=read');
+-------------------------------------------+
| version_tokens_set('emp=write;prod=read') |
+-------------------------------------------+
| 2 version tokens set.                     |
+-------------------------------------------+
```

Server 3:

```sql
mysql> SELECT version_tokens_set('emp=read;prod=write');
+-------------------------------------------+
| version_tokens_set('emp=read;prod=write') |
+-------------------------------------------+
| 2 version tokens set.                     |
+-------------------------------------------+
```

The token list in each case is specified as a
semicolon-separated list of
`name=value`
pairs. The resulting token list values result in these server
assignments:

- Any server accepts reads for either database.
- Only server 2 accepts updates for the `emp`
  database.
- Only server 3 accepts updates for the
  `prod` database.

In addition to assigning each server a version token list, the
management application also maintains a cache that reflects the
server assignments.

Before communicating with the servers, a client application
contacts the management application and retrieves information
about server assignments. Then the client selects a server based
on those assignments. Suppose that a client wants to perform
both reads and writes on the `emp` database.
Based on the preceding assignments, only server 2 qualifies. The
client connects to server 2 and registers its server
requirements there by setting its
[`version_tokens_session`](version-tokens-reference.md#sysvar_version_tokens_session) system
variable:

```sql
mysql> SET @@SESSION.version_tokens_session = 'emp=write';
```

For subsequent statements sent by the client to server 2, the
server compares its own version token list to the client list to
check whether they match. If so, statements execute normally:

```sql
mysql> UPDATE emp.employee SET salary = salary * 1.1 WHERE id = 4981;
Query OK, 1 row affected (0.07 sec)
Rows matched: 1  Changed: 1  Warnings: 0

mysql> SELECT last_name, first_name FROM emp.employee WHERE id = 4981;
+-----------+------------+
| last_name | first_name |
+-----------+------------+
| Smith     | Abe        |
+-----------+------------+
1 row in set (0.01 sec)
```

Discrepancies between the server and client version token lists
can occur two ways:

- A token name in the
  [`version_tokens_session`](version-tokens-reference.md#sysvar_version_tokens_session)
  value is not present in the server token list. In this case,
  an
  [`ER_VTOKEN_PLUGIN_TOKEN_NOT_FOUND`](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/mysql-errors/8.0/en/server-error-reference.html#error_er_vtoken_plugin_token_not_found)
  error occurs.
- A token value in the
  [`version_tokens_session`](version-tokens-reference.md#sysvar_version_tokens_session)
  value differs from the value of the corresponding token in
  the server token list. In this case, an
  [`ER_VTOKEN_PLUGIN_TOKEN_MISMATCH`](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/mysql-errors/8.0/en/server-error-reference.html#error_er_vtoken_plugin_token_mismatch)
  error occurs.

As long as the assignment of server 2 does not change, the
client continues to use it for reads and writes. But suppose
that the management application wants to change server
assignments so that writes for the `emp`
database must be sent to server 1 instead of server 2. To do
this, it uses
[`version_tokens_edit()`](version-tokens-reference.md#function_version-tokens-edit) to modify
the `emp` token value on the two servers (and
updates its cache of server assignments):

Server 1:

```sql
mysql> SELECT version_tokens_edit('emp=write');
+----------------------------------+
| version_tokens_edit('emp=write') |
+----------------------------------+
| 1 version tokens updated.        |
+----------------------------------+
```

Server 2:

```sql
mysql> SELECT version_tokens_edit('emp=read');
+---------------------------------+
| version_tokens_edit('emp=read') |
+---------------------------------+
| 1 version tokens updated.       |
+---------------------------------+
```

[`version_tokens_edit()`](version-tokens-reference.md#function_version-tokens-edit) modifies
the named tokens in the server token list and leaves other
tokens unchanged.

The next time the client sends a statement to server 2, its own
token list no longer matches the server token list and an error
occurs:

```sql
mysql> UPDATE emp.employee SET salary = salary * 1.1 WHERE id = 4982;
ERROR 3136 (42000): Version token mismatch for emp. Correct value read
```

In this case, the client should contact the management
application to obtain updated information about server
assignments, select a new server, and send the failed statement
to the new server.

Note

Each client must cooperate with Version Tokens by sending only
statements in accordance with the token list that it registers
with a given server. For example, if a client registers a
token list of `'emp=read'`, there is nothing
in Version Tokens to prevent the client from sending updates
for the `emp` database. The client itself
must refrain from doing so.

For each statement received from a client, the server implicitly
uses locking, as follows:

- Take a shared lock for each token named in the client token
  list (that is, in the
  [`version_tokens_session`](version-tokens-reference.md#sysvar_version_tokens_session)
  value)
- Perform the comparison between the server and client token
  lists
- Execute the statement or produce an error depending on the
  comparison result
- Release the locks

The server uses shared locks so that comparisons for multiple
sessions can occur without blocking, while preventing changes to
the tokens for any session that attempts to acquire an exclusive
lock before it manipulates tokens of the same names in the
server token list.

The preceding example uses only a few of the functions included
in the Version Tokens plugin library, but there are others. One
set of functions permits the server's list of version tokens to
be manipulated and inspected. Another set of functions permits
version tokens to be locked and unlocked.

These functions permit the server's list of version tokens to be
created, changed, removed, and inspected:

- [`version_tokens_set()`](version-tokens-reference.md#function_version-tokens-set)
  completely replaces the current list and assigns a new list.
  The argument is a semicolon-separated list of
  `name=value`
  pairs.
- [`version_tokens_edit()`](version-tokens-reference.md#function_version-tokens-edit) enables
  partial modifications to the current list. It can add new
  tokens or change the values of existing tokens. The argument
  is a semicolon-separated list of
  `name=value`
  pairs.
- [`version_tokens_delete()`](version-tokens-reference.md#function_version-tokens-delete)
  deletes tokens from the current list. The argument is a
  semicolon-separated list of token names.
- [`version_tokens_show()`](version-tokens-reference.md#function_version-tokens-show)
  displays the current token list. It takes no argument.

Each of those functions, if successful, returns a binary string
indicating what action occurred. The following example
establishes the server token list, modifies it by adding a new
token, deletes some tokens, and displays the resulting token
list:

```sql
mysql> SELECT version_tokens_set('tok1=a;tok2=b');
+-------------------------------------+
| version_tokens_set('tok1=a;tok2=b') |
+-------------------------------------+
| 2 version tokens set.               |
+-------------------------------------+
mysql> SELECT version_tokens_edit('tok3=c');
+-------------------------------+
| version_tokens_edit('tok3=c') |
+-------------------------------+
| 1 version tokens updated.     |
+-------------------------------+
mysql> SELECT version_tokens_delete('tok2;tok1');
+------------------------------------+
| version_tokens_delete('tok2;tok1') |
+------------------------------------+
| 2 version tokens deleted.          |
+------------------------------------+
mysql> SELECT version_tokens_show();
+-----------------------+
| version_tokens_show() |
+-----------------------+
| tok3=c;               |
+-----------------------+
```

Warnings occur if a token list is malformed:

```sql
mysql> SELECT version_tokens_set('tok1=a; =c');
+----------------------------------+
| version_tokens_set('tok1=a; =c') |
+----------------------------------+
| 1 version tokens set.            |
+----------------------------------+
1 row in set, 1 warning (0.00 sec)

mysql> SHOW WARNINGS\G
*************************** 1. row ***************************
  Level: Warning
   Code: 42000
Message: Invalid version token pair encountered. The list provided
         is only partially updated.
1 row in set (0.00 sec)
```

As mentioned previously, version tokens are defined using a
semicolon-separated list of
`name=value`
pairs. Consider this invocation of
[`version_tokens_set()`](version-tokens-reference.md#function_version-tokens-set):

```sql
mysql> SELECT version_tokens_set('tok1=b;;; tok2= a = b ; tok1 = 1\'2 3"4')
+---------------------------------------------------------------+
| version_tokens_set('tok1=b;;; tok2= a = b ; tok1 = 1\'2 3"4') |
+---------------------------------------------------------------+
| 3 version tokens set.                                         |
+---------------------------------------------------------------+
```

Version Tokens interprets the argument as follows:

- Whitespace around names and values is ignored. Whitespace
  within names and values is permitted. (For
  [`version_tokens_delete()`](version-tokens-reference.md#function_version-tokens-delete),
  which takes a list of names without values, whitespace
  around names is ignored.)
- There is no quoting mechanism.
- Order of tokens is not significant except that if a token
  list contains multiple instances of a given token name, the
  last value takes precedence over earlier values.

Given those rules, the preceding
[`version_tokens_set()`](version-tokens-reference.md#function_version-tokens-set) call results
in a token list with two tokens: `tok1` has the
value `1'2 3"4`, and `tok2`
has the value `a = b`. To verify this, call
[`version_tokens_show()`](version-tokens-reference.md#function_version-tokens-show):

```sql
mysql> SELECT version_tokens_show();
+--------------------------+
| version_tokens_show()    |
+--------------------------+
| tok2=a = b;tok1=1'2 3"4; |
+--------------------------+
```

If the token list contains two tokens, why did
[`version_tokens_set()`](version-tokens-reference.md#function_version-tokens-set) return the
value `3 version tokens set`? That occurred
because the original token list contained two definitions for
`tok1`, and the second definition replaced the
first.

The Version Tokens token-manipulation functions place these
constraints on token names and values:

- Token names cannot contain `=` or
  `;` characters and have a maximum length of
  64 characters.
- Token values cannot contain `;` characters.
  Length of values is constrained by the value of the
  [`max_allowed_packet`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_max_allowed_packet) system
  variable.
- Version Tokens treats token names and values as binary
  strings, so comparisons are case-sensitive.

Version Tokens also includes a set of functions enabling tokens
to be locked and unlocked:

- [`version_tokens_lock_exclusive()`](version-tokens-reference.md#function_version-tokens-lock-exclusive)
  acquires exclusive version token locks. It takes a list of
  one or more lock names and a timeout value.
- [`version_tokens_lock_shared()`](version-tokens-reference.md#function_version-tokens-lock-shared)
  acquires shared version token locks. It takes a list of one
  or more lock names and a timeout value.
- [`version_tokens_unlock()`](version-tokens-reference.md#function_version-tokens-unlock)
  releases version token locks (exclusive and shared). It
  takes no argument.

Each locking function returns nonzero for success. Otherwise, an
error occurs:

```sql
mysql> SELECT version_tokens_lock_shared('lock1', 'lock2', 0);
+-------------------------------------------------+
| version_tokens_lock_shared('lock1', 'lock2', 0) |
+-------------------------------------------------+
|                                               1 |
+-------------------------------------------------+

mysql> SELECT version_tokens_lock_shared(NULL, 0);
ERROR 3131 (42000): Incorrect locking service lock name '(null)'.
```

Locking using Version Tokens locking functions is advisory;
applications must agree to cooperate.

It is possible to lock nonexisting token names. This does not
create the tokens.

Note

Version Tokens locking functions are based on the locking
service described at [Section 7.6.9.1, “The Locking Service”](locking-service.md "7.6.9.1 The Locking Service"), and
thus have the same semantics for shared and exclusive locks.
(Version Tokens uses the locking service routines built into
the server, not the locking service function interface, so
those functions need not be installed to use Version Tokens.)
Locks acquired by Version Tokens use a locking service
namespace of `version_token_locks`. Locking
service locks can be monitored using the Performance Schema,
so this is also true for Version Tokens locks. For details,
see [Locking Service Monitoring](locking-service.md#locking-service-monitoring "Locking Service Monitoring").

For the Version Tokens locking functions, token name arguments
are used exactly as specified. Surrounding whitespace is not
ignored and `=` and `;`
characters are permitted. This is because Version Tokens simply
passes the token names to be locked as is to the locking
service.
