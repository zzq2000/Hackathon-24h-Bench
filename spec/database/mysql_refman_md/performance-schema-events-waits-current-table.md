#### 29.12.4.1 The events\_waits\_current Table

The [`events_waits_current`](performance-schema-events-waits-current-table.md "29.12.4.1 The events_waits_current Table") table
contains current wait events. The table stores one row per
thread showing the current status of the thread's most recent
monitored wait event, so there is no system variable for
configuring the table size.

Of the tables that contain wait event rows,
[`events_waits_current`](performance-schema-events-waits-current-table.md "29.12.4.1 The events_waits_current Table") is the most
fundamental. Other tables that contain wait event rows are
logically derived from the current events. For example, the
[`events_waits_history`](performance-schema-events-waits-history-table.md "29.12.4.2 The events_waits_history Table") and
[`events_waits_history_long`](performance-schema-events-waits-history-long-table.md "29.12.4.3 The events_waits_history_long Table") tables
are collections of the most recent wait events that have
ended, up to a maximum number of rows per thread and globally
across all threads, respectively.

For more information about the relationship between the three
wait event tables, see
[Section 29.9, “Performance Schema Tables for Current and Historical Events”](performance-schema-event-tables.md "29.9 Performance Schema Tables for Current and Historical Events").

For information about configuring whether to collect wait
events, see [Section 29.12.4, “Performance Schema Wait Event Tables”](performance-schema-wait-tables.md "29.12.4 Performance Schema Wait Event Tables").

The [`events_waits_current`](performance-schema-events-waits-current-table.md "29.12.4.1 The events_waits_current Table") table
has these columns:

- `THREAD_ID`, `EVENT_ID`

  The thread associated with the event and the thread
  current event number when the event starts. The
  `THREAD_ID` and
  `EVENT_ID` values taken together uniquely
  identify the row. No two rows have the same pair of
  values.
- `END_EVENT_ID`

  This column is set to `NULL` when the
  event starts and updated to the thread current event
  number when the event ends.
- `EVENT_NAME`

  The name of the instrument that produced the event. This
  is a `NAME` value from the
  [`setup_instruments`](performance-schema-setup-instruments-table.md "29.12.2.3 The setup_instruments Table") table.
  Instrument names may have multiple parts and form a
  hierarchy, as discussed in
  [Section 29.6, “Performance Schema Instrument Naming Conventions”](performance-schema-instrument-naming.md "29.6 Performance Schema Instrument Naming Conventions").
- `SOURCE`

  The name of the source file containing the instrumented
  code that produced the event and the line number in the
  file at which the instrumentation occurs. This enables you
  to check the source to determine exactly what code is
  involved. For example, if a mutex or lock is being
  blocked, you can check the context in which this occurs.
- `TIMER_START`,
  `TIMER_END`,
  `TIMER_WAIT`

  Timing information for the event. The unit for these
  values is picoseconds (trillionths of a second). The
  `TIMER_START` and
  `TIMER_END` values indicate when event
  timing started and ended. `TIMER_WAIT` is
  the event elapsed time (duration).

  If an event has not finished, `TIMER_END`
  is the current timer value and
  `TIMER_WAIT` is the time elapsed so far
  (`TIMER_END` −
  `TIMER_START`).

  If an event is produced from an instrument that has
  `TIMED = NO`, timing information is not
  collected, and `TIMER_START`,
  `TIMER_END`, and
  `TIMER_WAIT` are all
  `NULL`.

  For discussion of picoseconds as the unit for event times
  and factors that affect time values, see
  [Section 29.4.1, “Performance Schema Event Timing”](performance-schema-timing.md "29.4.1 Performance Schema Event Timing").
- `SPINS`

  For a mutex, the number of spin rounds. If the value is
  `NULL`, the code does not use spin rounds
  or spinning is not instrumented.
- `OBJECT_SCHEMA`,
  `OBJECT_NAME`,
  `OBJECT_TYPE`,
  `OBJECT_INSTANCE_BEGIN`

  These columns identify the object “being acted
  on.” What that means depends on the object type.

  For a synchronization object (`cond`,
  `mutex`, `rwlock`):

  - `OBJECT_SCHEMA`,
    `OBJECT_NAME`, and
    `OBJECT_TYPE` are
    `NULL`.
  - `OBJECT_INSTANCE_BEGIN` is the
    address of the synchronization object in memory.

  For a file I/O object:

  - `OBJECT_SCHEMA` is
    `NULL`.
  - `OBJECT_NAME` is the file name.
  - `OBJECT_TYPE` is
    `FILE`.
  - `OBJECT_INSTANCE_BEGIN` is an address
    in memory.

  For a socket object:

  - `OBJECT_NAME` is the
    `IP:PORT` value for the socket.
  - `OBJECT_INSTANCE_BEGIN` is an address
    in memory.

  For a table I/O object:

  - `OBJECT_SCHEMA` is the name of the
    schema that contains the table.
  - `OBJECT_NAME` is the table name.
  - `OBJECT_TYPE` is
    `TABLE` for a persistent base table
    or `TEMPORARY TABLE` for a temporary
    table.
  - `OBJECT_INSTANCE_BEGIN` is an address
    in memory.

  An `OBJECT_INSTANCE_BEGIN` value itself
  has no meaning, except that different values indicate
  different objects.
  `OBJECT_INSTANCE_BEGIN` can be used for
  debugging. For example, it can be used with `GROUP
  BY OBJECT_INSTANCE_BEGIN` to see whether the load
  on 1,000 mutexes (that protect, say, 1,000 pages or blocks
  of data) is spread evenly or just hitting a few
  bottlenecks. This can help you correlate with other
  sources of information if you see the same object address
  in a log file or another debugging or performance tool.
- `INDEX_NAME`

  The name of the index used. `PRIMARY`
  indicates the table primary index. `NULL`
  means that no index was used.
- `NESTING_EVENT_ID`

  The `EVENT_ID` value of the event within
  which this event is nested.
- `NESTING_EVENT_TYPE`

  The nesting event type. The value is
  `TRANSACTION`,
  `STATEMENT`, `STAGE`, or
  `WAIT`.
- `OPERATION`

  The type of operation performed, such as
  `lock`, `read`, or
  `write`.
- `NUMBER_OF_BYTES`

  The number of bytes read or written by the operation. For
  table I/O waits (events for the
  `wait/io/table/sql/handler` instrument),
  `NUMBER_OF_BYTES` indicates the number of
  rows. If the value is greater than 1, the event is for a
  batch I/O operation. The following discussion describes
  the difference between exclusively single-row reporting
  and reporting that reflects batch I/O.

  MySQL executes joins using a nested-loop implementation.
  The job of the Performance Schema instrumentation is to
  provide row count and accumulated execution time per table
  in the join. Assume a join query of the following form
  that is executed using a table join order of
  `t1`, `t2`,
  `t3`:

  ```sql
  SELECT ... FROM t1 JOIN t2 ON ... JOIN t3 ON ...
  ```

  Table “fanout” is the increase or decrease in
  number of rows from adding a table during join processing.
  If the fanout for table `t3` is greater
  than 1, the majority of row-fetch operations are for that
  table. Suppose that the join accesses 10 rows from
  `t1`, 20 rows from `t2`
  per row from `t1`, and 30 rows from
  `t3` per row of table
  `t2`. With single-row reporting, the
  total number of instrumented operations is:

  ```clike
  10 + (10 * 20) + (10 * 20 * 30) = 6210
  ```

  A significant reduction in the number of instrumented
  operations is achievable by aggregating them per scan
  (that is, per unique combination of rows from
  `t1` and `t2`). With
  batch I/O reporting, the Performance Schema produces an
  event for each scan of the innermost table
  `t3` rather than for each row, and the
  number of instrumented row operations reduces to:

  ```clike
  10 + (10 * 20) + (10 * 20) = 410
  ```

  That is a reduction of 93%, illustrating how the
  batch-reporting strategy significantly reduces Performance
  Schema overhead for table I/O by reducing the number of
  reporting calls. The tradeoff is lesser accuracy for event
  timing. Rather than time for an individual row operation
  as in per-row reporting, timing for batch I/O includes
  time spent for operations such as join buffering,
  aggregation, and returning rows to the client.

  For batch I/O reporting to occur, these conditions must be
  true:

  - Query execution accesses the innermost table of a
    query block (for a single-table query, that table
    counts as innermost)
  - Query execution does not request a single row from the
    table (so, for example,
    [`eq_ref`](explain-output.md#jointype_eq_ref) access
    prevents use of batch reporting)
  - Query execution does not evaluate a subquery
    containing table access for the table
- `FLAGS`

  Reserved for future use.

The [`events_waits_current`](performance-schema-events-waits-current-table.md "29.12.4.1 The events_waits_current Table") table
has these indexes:

- Primary key on (`THREAD_ID`,
  `EVENT_ID`)

[`TRUNCATE TABLE`](truncate-table.md "15.1.37 TRUNCATE TABLE Statement") is permitted for
the [`events_waits_current`](performance-schema-events-waits-current-table.md "29.12.4.1 The events_waits_current Table") table.
It removes the rows.
