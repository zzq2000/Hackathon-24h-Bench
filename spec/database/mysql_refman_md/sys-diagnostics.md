#### 30.4.4.2 The diagnostics() Procedure

Creates a report of the current server status for diagnostic
purposes.

This procedure disables binary logging during its execution by
manipulating the session value of the
[`sql_log_bin`](replication-options-binary-log.md#sysvar_sql_log_bin) system variable.
That is a restricted operation, so the procedure requires
privileges sufficient to set restricted session variables. See
[Section 7.1.9.1, “System Variable Privileges”](system-variable-privileges.md "7.1.9.1 System Variable Privileges").

Data collected for [`diagnostics()`](sys-diagnostics.md "30.4.4.2 The diagnostics() Procedure")
includes this information:

- Information from the [`metrics`](sys-metrics.md "30.4.3.21 The metrics View")
  view (see [Section 30.4.3.21, “The metrics View”](sys-metrics.md "30.4.3.21 The metrics View"))
- Information from other relevant `sys`
  schema views, such as the one that determines queries in
  the 95th percentile
- Information from the
  [`ndbinfo`](mysql-cluster-ndbinfo.md "25.6.16 ndbinfo: The NDB Cluster Information Database") schema, if the
  MySQL server is part of NDB Cluster
- Replication status (both source and replica)

Some of the sys schema views are calculated as initial
(optional), overall, and delta values:

- The initial view is the content of the view at the start
  of the [`diagnostics()`](sys-diagnostics.md "30.4.4.2 The diagnostics() Procedure")
  procedure. This output is the same as the start values
  used for the delta view. The initial view is included if
  the `diagnostics.include_raw`
  configuration option is `ON`.
- The overall view is the content of the view at the end of
  the [`diagnostics()`](sys-diagnostics.md "30.4.4.2 The diagnostics() Procedure") procedure.
  This output is the same as the end values used for the
  delta view. The overall view is always included.
- The delta view is the difference from the beginning to the
  end of procedure execution. The minimum and maximum values
  are the minimum and maximum values from the end view,
  respectively. They do not necessarily reflect the minimum
  and maximum values in the monitored period. Except for the
  [`metrics`](sys-metrics.md "30.4.3.21 The metrics View") view, the delta is
  calculated only between the first and last outputs.

##### Parameters

- `in_max_runtime INT UNSIGNED`: The
  maximum data collection time in seconds. Use
  `NULL` to collect data for the default
  of 60 seconds. Otherwise, use a value greater than 0.
- `in_interval INT UNSIGNED`: The sleep
  time between data collections in seconds. Use
  `NULL` to sleep for the default of 30
  seconds. Otherwise, use a value greater than 0.
- `in_auto_config ENUM('current', 'medium',
  'full')`: The Performance Schema configuration
  to use. Permitted values are:

  - `current`: Use the current
    instrument and consumer settings.
  - `medium`: Enable some instruments
    and consumers.
  - `full`: Enable all instruments and
    consumers.

  Note

  The more instruments and consumers enabled, the more
  impact on MySQL server performance. Be careful with
  the `medium` setting and especially
  the `full` setting, which has a large
  performance impact.

  Use of the `medium` or
  `full` setting requires the
  [`SUPER`](privileges-provided.md#priv_super) privilege.

  If a setting other than `current` is
  chosen, the current settings are restored at the end of
  the procedure.

##### Configuration Options

[`diagnostics()`](sys-diagnostics.md "30.4.4.2 The diagnostics() Procedure") operation can be
modified using the following configuration options or their
corresponding user-defined variables (see
[Section 30.4.2.1, “The sys\_config Table”](sys-sys-config.md "30.4.2.1 The sys_config Table")):

- `debug`, `@sys.debug`

  If this option is `ON`, produce
  debugging output. The default is `OFF`.
- `diagnostics.allow_i_s_tables`,
  `@sys.diagnostics.allow_i_s_tables`

  If this option is `ON`, the
  [`diagnostics()`](sys-diagnostics.md "30.4.4.2 The diagnostics() Procedure") procedure is
  permitted to perform table scans on the Information
  Schema [`TABLES`](information-schema-tables-table.md "28.3.38 The INFORMATION_SCHEMA TABLES Table") table. This
  can be expensive if there are many tables. The default
  is `OFF`.
- `diagnostics.include_raw`,
  `@sys.diagnostics.include_raw`

  If this option is `ON`, the
  [`diagnostics()`](sys-diagnostics.md "30.4.4.2 The diagnostics() Procedure") procedure
  output includes the raw output from querying the
  [`metrics`](sys-metrics.md "30.4.3.21 The metrics View") view. The default
  is `OFF`.
- `statement_truncate_len`,
  `@sys.statement_truncate_len`

  The maximum length of statements returned by the
  [`format_statement()`](sys-format-statement.md "30.4.5.5 The format_statement() Function")
  function. Longer statements are truncated to this
  length. The default is 64.

##### Example

Create a diagnostics report that starts an iteration every
30 seconds and runs for at most 120 seconds using the
current Performance Schema settings:

```sql
mysql> CALL sys.diagnostics(120, 30, 'current');
```

To capture the output from the
`diagnostics()` procedure in a file as it
runs, use the [**mysql**](mysql.md "6.5.1 mysql — The MySQL Command-Line Client") client `tee
filename` and
`notee` commands (see
[Section 6.5.1.2, “mysql Client Commands”](mysql-commands.md "6.5.1.2 mysql Client Commands")):

```sql
mysql> tee diag.out;
mysql> CALL sys.diagnostics(120, 30, 'current');
mysql> notee;
```
