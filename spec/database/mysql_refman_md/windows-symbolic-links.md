#### 10.12.2.3 Using Symbolic Links for Databases on Windows

On Windows, symbolic links can be used for database
directories. This enables you to put a database directory at a
different location (for example, on a different disk) by
setting up a symbolic link to it. Use of database symlinks on
Windows is similar to their use on Unix, although the
procedure for setting up the link differs.

Suppose that you want to place the database directory for a
database named `mydb` at
`D:\data\mydb`. To do this, create a
symbolic link in the MySQL data directory that points to
`D:\data\mydb`. However, before creating
the symbolic link, make sure that the
`D:\data\mydb` directory exists by creating
it if necessary. If you already have a database directory
named `mydb` in the data directory, move it
to `D:\data`. Otherwise, the symbolic link
has no effect. To avoid problems, make sure that the server is
not running when you move the database directory.

On Windows, you can create a symlink using the
**mklink** command. This command
requires administrative privileges.

1. Make sure that the desired path to the database exists.
   For this example, we use
   `D:\data\mydb`, and a database named
   `mydb`.
2. If the database does not already exist, issue
   `CREATE DATABASE mydb` in the
   [**mysql**](mysql.md "6.5.1 mysql — The MySQL Command-Line Client") client to create it.
3. Stop the MySQL service.
4. Using Windows Explorer or the command line, move the
   directory `mydb` from the data
   directory to `D:\data`, replacing the
   directory of the same name.
5. If you are not already using the command prompt, open it,
   and change location to the data directory, like this:

   ```terminal
   C:\> cd \path\to\datadir
   ```

   If your MySQL installation is in the default location, you
   can use this:

   ```terminal
   C:\> cd C:\ProgramData\MySQL\MySQL Server 8.0\Data
   ```
6. In the data directory, create a symlink named
   `mydb` that points to the location of
   the database directory:

   ```terminal
   C:\> mklink /d mydb D:\data\mydb
   ```
7. Start the MySQL service.

After this, all tables created in the database
`mydb` are created in
`D:\data\mydb`.

Alternatively, on any version of Windows supported by MySQL,
you can create a symbolic link to a MySQL database by creating
a `.sym` file in the data directory that
contains the path to the destination directory. The file
should be named
`db_name.sym`,
where *`db_name`* is the database name.

Support for database symbolic links on Windows using
`.sym` files is enabled by default. If you
do not need `.sym` file symbolic links, you
can disable support for them by starting
[**mysqld**](mysqld.md "6.3.1 mysqld — The MySQL Server") with the
[`--skip-symbolic-links`](server-options.md#option_mysqld_symbolic-links)
option. To determine whether your system supports
`.sym` file symbolic links, check the value
of the [`have_symlink`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_have_symlink) system
variable using this statement:

```sql
SHOW VARIABLES LIKE 'have_symlink';
```

To create a `.sym` file symlink, use this
procedure:

1. Change location into the data directory:

   ```terminal
   C:\> cd \path\to\datadir
   ```
2. In the data directory, create a text file named
   `mydb.sym` that contains this path
   name: `D:\data\mydb\`

   Note

   The path name to the new database and tables should be
   absolute. If you specify a relative path, the location
   is relative to the `mydb.sym` file.

After this, all tables created in the database
`mydb` are created in
`D:\data\mydb`.
