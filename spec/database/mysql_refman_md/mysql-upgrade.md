### 6.4.5 mysql\_upgrade — Check and Upgrade MySQL Tables

Note

As of MySQL 8.0.16, the MySQL server performs the upgrade
tasks previously handled by [**mysql\_upgrade**](mysql-upgrade.md "6.4.5 mysql_upgrade — Check and Upgrade MySQL Tables")
(for details, see
[Section 3.4, “What the MySQL Upgrade Process Upgrades”](upgrading-what-is-upgraded.md "3.4 What the MySQL Upgrade Process Upgrades")). Consequently,
[**mysql\_upgrade**](mysql-upgrade.md "6.4.5 mysql_upgrade — Check and Upgrade MySQL Tables") is unneeded and is deprecated
as of that version; expect it to be removed in a future
version of MySQL. Because [**mysql\_upgrade**](mysql-upgrade.md "6.4.5 mysql_upgrade — Check and Upgrade MySQL Tables") no
longer performs upgrade tasks, it exits with status 0
unconditionally.

Each time you upgrade MySQL, you should execute
[**mysql\_upgrade**](mysql-upgrade.md "6.4.5 mysql_upgrade — Check and Upgrade MySQL Tables"), which looks for
incompatibilities with the upgraded MySQL server:

- It upgrades the system tables in the
  `mysql` schema so that you can take
  advantage of new privileges or capabilities that might have
  been added.
- It upgrades the Performance Schema,
  `INFORMATION_SCHEMA`, and
  `sys` schema.
- It examines user schemas.

If [**mysql\_upgrade**](mysql-upgrade.md "6.4.5 mysql_upgrade — Check and Upgrade MySQL Tables") finds that a table has a
possible incompatibility, it performs a table check and, if
problems are found, attempts a table repair. If the table cannot
be repaired, see [Section 3.14, “Rebuilding or Repairing Tables or Indexes”](rebuilding-tables.md "3.14 Rebuilding or Repairing Tables or Indexes") for manual
table repair strategies.

[**mysql\_upgrade**](mysql-upgrade.md "6.4.5 mysql_upgrade — Check and Upgrade MySQL Tables") communicates directly with the
MySQL server, sending it the SQL statements required to perform
an upgrade.

Caution

You should always back up your current MySQL installation
*before* performing an upgrade. See
[Section 9.2, “Database Backup Methods”](backup-methods.md "9.2 Database Backup Methods").

Some upgrade incompatibilities may require special handling
*before* upgrading your MySQL installation
and running [**mysql\_upgrade**](mysql-upgrade.md "6.4.5 mysql_upgrade — Check and Upgrade MySQL Tables"). See
[Chapter 3, *Upgrading MySQL*](upgrading.md "Chapter 3 Upgrading MySQL"), for instructions on determining
whether any such incompatibilities apply to your installation
and how to handle them.

Use [**mysql\_upgrade**](mysql-upgrade.md "6.4.5 mysql_upgrade — Check and Upgrade MySQL Tables") like this:

1. Ensure that the server is running.
2. Invoke [**mysql\_upgrade**](mysql-upgrade.md "6.4.5 mysql_upgrade — Check and Upgrade MySQL Tables") to upgrade the
   system tables in the `mysql` schema and
   check and repair tables in other schemas:

   ```terminal
   mysql_upgrade [options]
   ```
3. Stop the server and restart it so that any system table
   changes take effect.

If you have multiple MySQL server instances to upgrade, invoke
[**mysql\_upgrade**](mysql-upgrade.md "6.4.5 mysql_upgrade — Check and Upgrade MySQL Tables") with connection parameters
appropriate for connecting to each of the desired servers. For
example, with servers running on the local host on parts 3306
through 3308, upgrade each of them by connecting to the
appropriate port:

```terminal
mysql_upgrade --protocol=tcp -P 3306 [other_options]
mysql_upgrade --protocol=tcp -P 3307 [other_options]
mysql_upgrade --protocol=tcp -P 3308 [other_options]
```

For local host connections on Unix, the
[`--protocol=tcp`](mysql-upgrade.md#option_mysql_upgrade_protocol) option
forces a connection using TCP/IP rather than the Unix socket
file.

By default, [**mysql\_upgrade**](mysql-upgrade.md "6.4.5 mysql_upgrade — Check and Upgrade MySQL Tables") runs as the MySQL
`root` user. If the `root`
password is expired when you run
[**mysql\_upgrade**](mysql-upgrade.md "6.4.5 mysql_upgrade — Check and Upgrade MySQL Tables"), it displays a message that
your password is expired and that
[**mysql\_upgrade**](mysql-upgrade.md "6.4.5 mysql_upgrade — Check and Upgrade MySQL Tables") failed as a result. To correct
this, reset the `root` password to unexpire it
and run [**mysql\_upgrade**](mysql-upgrade.md "6.4.5 mysql_upgrade — Check and Upgrade MySQL Tables") again. First, connect
to the server as `root`:

```terminal
$> mysql -u root -p
Enter password: ****  <- enter root password here
```

Reset the password using [`ALTER
USER`](alter-user.md "15.7.1.1 ALTER USER Statement"):

```sql
mysql> ALTER USER USER() IDENTIFIED BY 'root-password';
```

Then exit [**mysql**](mysql.md "6.5.1 mysql — The MySQL Command-Line Client") and run
[**mysql\_upgrade**](mysql-upgrade.md "6.4.5 mysql_upgrade — Check and Upgrade MySQL Tables") again:

```terminal
$> mysql_upgrade [options]
```

Note

If you run the server with the
[`disabled_storage_engines`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_disabled_storage_engines)
system variable set to disable certain storage engines (for
example, `MyISAM`),
[**mysql\_upgrade**](mysql-upgrade.md "6.4.5 mysql_upgrade — Check and Upgrade MySQL Tables") might fail with an error like
this:

```simple
mysql_upgrade: [ERROR] 3161: Storage engine MyISAM is disabled
(Table creation is disallowed).
```

To handle this, restart the server with
[`disabled_storage_engines`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_disabled_storage_engines)
disabled. Then you should be able to run
[**mysql\_upgrade**](mysql-upgrade.md "6.4.5 mysql_upgrade — Check and Upgrade MySQL Tables") successfully. After that,
restart the server with
[`disabled_storage_engines`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_disabled_storage_engines) set
to its original value.

Unless invoked with the
[`--upgrade-system-tables`](mysql-upgrade.md#option_mysql_upgrade_upgrade-system-tables)
option, [**mysql\_upgrade**](mysql-upgrade.md "6.4.5 mysql_upgrade — Check and Upgrade MySQL Tables") processes all tables in
all user schemas as necessary. Table checking might take a long
time to complete. Each table is locked and therefore unavailable
to other sessions while it is being processed. Check and repair
operations can be time-consuming, particularly for large tables.
Table checking uses the `FOR UPGRADE` option of
the [`CHECK TABLE`](check-table.md "15.7.3.2 CHECK TABLE Statement") statement. For
details about what this option entails, see
[Section 15.7.3.2, “CHECK TABLE Statement”](check-table.md "15.7.3.2 CHECK TABLE Statement").

[**mysql\_upgrade**](mysql-upgrade.md "6.4.5 mysql_upgrade — Check and Upgrade MySQL Tables") marks all checked and repaired
tables with the current MySQL version number. This ensures that
the next time you run [**mysql\_upgrade**](mysql-upgrade.md "6.4.5 mysql_upgrade — Check and Upgrade MySQL Tables") with the
same version of the server, it can be determined whether there
is any need to check or repair a given table again.

[**mysql\_upgrade**](mysql-upgrade.md "6.4.5 mysql_upgrade — Check and Upgrade MySQL Tables") saves the MySQL version number
in a file named `mysql_upgrade_info` in the
data directory. This is used to quickly check whether all tables
have been checked for this release so that table-checking can be
skipped. To ignore this file and perform the check regardless,
use the [`--force`](mysql-upgrade.md#option_mysql_upgrade_force) option.

Note

The `mysql_upgrade_info` file is
deprecated; expect it to be removed in a future version of
MySQL.

[**mysql\_upgrade**](mysql-upgrade.md "6.4.5 mysql_upgrade — Check and Upgrade MySQL Tables") checks
`mysql.user` system table rows and, for any row
with an empty `plugin` column, sets that column
to `'mysql_native_password'` if the credentials
use a hash format compatible with that plugin. Rows with a
pre-4.1 password hash must be upgraded manually.

[**mysql\_upgrade**](mysql-upgrade.md "6.4.5 mysql_upgrade — Check and Upgrade MySQL Tables") does not upgrade the contents
of the time zone tables or help tables. For upgrade
instructions, see [Section 7.1.15, “MySQL Server Time Zone Support”](time-zone-support.md "7.1.15 MySQL Server Time Zone Support"), and
[Section 7.1.17, “Server-Side Help Support”](server-side-help-support.md "7.1.17 Server-Side Help Support").

Unless invoked with the
[`--skip-sys-schema`](mysql-upgrade.md#option_mysql_upgrade_skip-sys-schema) option,
[**mysql\_upgrade**](mysql-upgrade.md "6.4.5 mysql_upgrade — Check and Upgrade MySQL Tables") installs the
`sys` schema if it is not installed, and
upgrades it to the current version otherwise. An error occurs if
a `sys` schema exists but has no
`version` view, on the assumption that its
absence indicates a user-created schema:

```none
A sys schema exists with no sys.version view. If
you have a user created sys schema, this must be renamed for the
upgrade to succeed.
```

To upgrade in this case, remove or rename the existing
`sys` schema first.

[**mysql\_upgrade**](mysql-upgrade.md "6.4.5 mysql_upgrade — Check and Upgrade MySQL Tables") supports the following options,
which can be specified on the command line or in the
`[mysql_upgrade]` and
`[client]` groups of an option file. For
information about option files used by MySQL programs, see
[Section 6.2.2.2, “Using Option Files”](option-files.md "6.2.2.2 Using Option Files").

  | --- | --- |
  | Command-Line Format | `--defaults-extra-file=file_name` |
  | Type | File name |

  Read this option file after the global option file but (on
  Unix) before the user option file. If the file does not
  exist or is otherwise inaccessible, an error occurs. If
  *`file_name`* is not an absolute path
  name, it is interpreted relative to the current directory.

  For additional information about this and other option-file
  options, see [Section 6.2.2.3, “Command-Line Options that Affect Option-File Handling”](option-file-options.md "6.2.2.3 Command-Line Options that Affect Option-File Handling").

  |  |  |
  | --- | --- |
  | Command-Line Format | `--defaults-group-suffix=str` |
  | Type | String |

  Read not only the usual option groups, but also groups with
  the usual names and a suffix of
  *`str`*. For example,
  [**mysql\_upgrade**](mysql-upgrade.md "6.4.5 mysql_upgrade — Check and Upgrade MySQL Tables") normally reads the
  `[client]` and
  `[mysql_upgrade]` groups. If this option is
  given as
  [`--defaults-group-suffix=_other`](mysql-upgrade.md#option_mysql_upgrade_defaults-group-suffix),
  [**mysql\_upgrade**](mysql-upgrade.md "6.4.5 mysql_upgrade — Check and Upgrade MySQL Tables") also reads the
  `[client_other]` and
  `[mysql_upgrade_other]` groups.

  For additional information about this and other option-file
  options, see [Section 6.2.2.3, “Command-Line Options that Affect Option-File Handling”](option-file-options.md "6.2.2.3 Command-Line Options that Affect Option-File Handling").

  | --- | --- |
  | Command-Line Format | `--force` |
  | Type | Boolean |

  Ignore the `mysql_upgrade_info` file and
  force execution even if [**mysql\_upgrade**](mysql-upgrade.md "6.4.5 mysql_upgrade — Check and Upgrade MySQL Tables") has
  already been executed for the current version of MySQL.
- [`--get-server-public-key`](mysql-upgrade.md#option_mysql_upgrade_get-server-public-key)

  |  |  |
  | --- | --- |
  | Command-Line Format | `--get-server-public-key` |
  | Type | Boolean |

  Request from the server the public key required for RSA key
  pair-based password exchange. This option applies to clients
  that authenticate with the
  `caching_sha2_password` authentication
  plugin. For that plugin, the server does not send the public
  key unless requested. This option is ignored for accounts
  that do not authenticate with that plugin. It is also
  ignored if RSA-based password exchange is not used, as is
  the case when the client connects to the server using a
  secure connection.

  If
  [`--server-public-key-path=file_name`](mysql-upgrade.md#option_mysql_upgrade_server-public-key-path)
  is given and specifies a valid public key file, it takes
  precedence over
  [`--get-server-public-key`](mysql-upgrade.md#option_mysql_upgrade_get-server-public-key).

  For information about the
  `caching_sha2_password` plugin, see
  [Section 8.4.1.2, “Caching SHA-2 Pluggable Authentication”](caching-sha2-pluggable-authentication.md "8.4.1.2 Caching SHA-2 Pluggable Authentication").

  | --- | --- |
  | Command-Line Format | `--login-path=name` |
  | Type | String |

  Read options from the named login path in the
  `.mylogin.cnf` login path file. A
  “login path” is an option group containing
  options that specify which MySQL server to connect to and
  which account to authenticate as. To create or modify a
  login path file, use the
  [**mysql\_config\_editor**](mysql-config-editor.md "6.6.7 mysql_config_editor — MySQL Configuration Utility") utility. See
  [Section 6.6.7, “mysql\_config\_editor — MySQL Configuration Utility”](mysql-config-editor.md "6.6.7 mysql_config_editor — MySQL Configuration Utility").

  For additional information about this and other option-file
  options, see [Section 6.2.2.3, “Command-Line Options that Affect Option-File Handling”](option-file-options.md "6.2.2.3 Command-Line Options that Affect Option-File Handling").

  The initial size of the buffer for client/server
  communication. The default value is 1MB − 1KB. The
  minimum and maximum values are 4KB and 16MB.
- [`--no-defaults`](mysql-upgrade.md#option_mysql_upgrade_no-defaults)

  |  |  |
  | --- | --- |
  | Command-Line Format | `--no-defaults` |

  Do not read any option files. If program startup fails due
  to reading unknown options from an option file,
  [`--no-defaults`](mysql-upgrade.md#option_mysql_upgrade_no-defaults) can be
  used to prevent them from being read.

  The exception is that the `.mylogin.cnf`
  file is read in all cases, if it exists. This permits
  passwords to be specified in a safer way than on the command
  line even when
  [`--no-defaults`](mysql-upgrade.md#option_mysql_upgrade_no-defaults) is used.
  To create `.mylogin.cnf`, use the
  [**mysql\_config\_editor**](mysql-config-editor.md "6.6.7 mysql_config_editor — MySQL Configuration Utility") utility. See
  [Section 6.6.7, “mysql\_config\_editor — MySQL Configuration Utility”](mysql-config-editor.md "6.6.7 mysql_config_editor — MySQL Configuration Utility").

  For additional information about this and other option-file
  options, see [Section 6.2.2.3, “Command-Line Options that Affect Option-File Handling”](option-file-options.md "6.2.2.3 Command-Line Options that Affect Option-File Handling").
- [`--password[=password]`](mysql-upgrade.md#option_mysql_upgrade_password),
  `-p[password]`

  |  |  |
  | --- | --- |
  | Command-Line Format | `--password[=name]` |
  | Type | String |

  The password of the MySQL account used for connecting to the
  server. The password value is optional. If not given,
  [**mysql\_upgrade**](mysql-upgrade.md "6.4.5 mysql_upgrade — Check and Upgrade MySQL Tables") prompts for one. If given,
  there must be *no space* between
  [`--password=`](mysql-upgrade.md#option_mysql_upgrade_password) or
  `-p` and the password following it. If no
  password option is specified, the default is to send no
  password.

  Specifying a password on the command line should be
  considered insecure. To avoid giving the password on the
  command line, use an option file. See
  [Section 8.1.2.1, “End-User Guidelines for Password Security”](password-security-user.md "8.1.2.1 End-User Guidelines for Password Security").

  To explicitly specify that there is no password and that
  [**mysql\_upgrade**](mysql-upgrade.md "6.4.5 mysql_upgrade — Check and Upgrade MySQL Tables") should not prompt for one,
  use the
  [`--skip-password`](mysql-upgrade.md#option_mysql_upgrade_password)
  option.
- [`--pipe`](mysql-upgrade.md#option_mysql_upgrade_pipe),
  `-W`

  |  |  |
  | --- | --- |
  | Command-Line Format | `--pipe` |
  | Type | String |

  On Windows, connect to the server using a named pipe. This
  option applies only if the server was started with the
  [`named_pipe`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_named_pipe) system variable
  enabled to support named-pipe connections. In addition, the
  user making the connection must be a member of the Windows
  group specified by the
  [`named_pipe_full_access_group`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_named_pipe_full_access_group)
  system variable.
- [`--plugin-dir=dir_name`](mysql-upgrade.md#option_mysql_upgrade_plugin-dir)

  |  |  |
  | --- | --- |
  | Command-Line Format | `--plugin-dir=dir_name` |
  | Type | Directory name |

  The directory in which to look for plugins. Specify this
  option if the
  [`--default-auth`](mysql-upgrade.md#option_mysql_upgrade_default-auth) option
  is used to specify an authentication plugin but
  [**mysql\_upgrade**](mysql-upgrade.md "6.4.5 mysql_upgrade — Check and Upgrade MySQL Tables") does not find it. See
  [Section 8.2.17, “Pluggable Authentication”](pluggable-authentication.md "8.2.17 Pluggable Authentication").
- [`--port=port_num`](mysql-upgrade.md#option_mysql_upgrade_port),
  `-P port_num`

  |  |  |
  | --- | --- |
  | Command-Line Format | `--port=#` |
  | Type | Numeric |

  For TCP/IP connections, the port number to use.
- [`--print-defaults`](mysql-upgrade.md#option_mysql_upgrade_print-defaults)

  |  |  |
  | --- | --- |
  | Command-Line Format | `--print-defaults` |

  Print the program name and all options that it gets from
  option files.
- [`--protocol={TCP|SOCKET|PIPE|MEMORY}`](mysql-upgrade.md#option_mysql_upgrade_protocol)

  |  |  |
  | --- | --- |
  | Command-Line Format | `--protocol=name` |
  | Type | String |

  The transport protocol to use for connecting to the server.
  It is useful when the other connection parameters normally
  result in use of a protocol other than the one you want. For
  details on the permissible values, see
  [Section 6.2.7, “Connection Transport Protocols”](transport-protocols.md "6.2.7 Connection Transport Protocols").
- [`--server-public-key-path=file_name`](mysql-upgrade.md#option_mysql_upgrade_server-public-key-path)

  |  |  |
  | --- | --- |
  | Command-Line Format | `--server-public-key-path=file_name` |
  | Type | File name |

  The path name to a file in PEM format containing a
  client-side copy of the public key required by the server
  for RSA key pair-based password exchange. This option
  applies to clients that authenticate with the
  `sha256_password` or
  `caching_sha2_password` authentication
  plugin. This option is ignored for accounts that do not
  authenticate with one of those plugins. It is also ignored
  if RSA-based password exchange is not used, as is the case
  when the client connects to the server using a secure
  connection.

  If
  [`--server-public-key-path=file_name`](mysql-upgrade.md#option_mysql_upgrade_server-public-key-path)
  is given and specifies a valid public key file, it takes
  precedence over
  [`--get-server-public-key`](mysql-upgrade.md#option_mysql_upgrade_get-server-public-key).

  For `sha256_password`, this option applies
  only if MySQL was built using OpenSSL.

  For information about the `sha256_password`
  and `caching_sha2_password` plugins, see
  [Section 8.4.1.3, “SHA-256 Pluggable Authentication”](sha256-pluggable-authentication.md "8.4.1.3 SHA-256 Pluggable Authentication"), and
  [Section 8.4.1.2, “Caching SHA-2 Pluggable Authentication”](caching-sha2-pluggable-authentication.md "8.4.1.2 Caching SHA-2 Pluggable Authentication").
- [`--shared-memory-base-name=name`](mysql-upgrade.md#option_mysql_upgrade_shared-memory-base-name)

  |  |  |
  | --- | --- |
  | Command-Line Format | `--shared-memory-base-name=name` |
  | Platform Specific | Windows |

  On Windows, the shared-memory name to use for connections
  made using shared memory to a local server. The default
  value is `MYSQL`. The shared-memory name is
  case-sensitive.

  This option applies only if the server was started with the
  [`shared_memory`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_shared_memory) system
  variable enabled to support shared-memory connections.
- [`--skip-sys-schema`](mysql-upgrade.md#option_mysql_upgrade_skip-sys-schema)

  |  |  |
  | --- | --- |
  | Command-Line Format | `--skip-sys-schema` |
  | Type | Boolean |
  | Default Value | `FALSE` |

  By default, [**mysql\_upgrade**](mysql-upgrade.md "6.4.5 mysql_upgrade — Check and Upgrade MySQL Tables") installs the
  `sys` schema if it is not installed, and
  upgrades it to the current version otherwise. The
  [`--skip-sys-schema`](mysql-upgrade.md#option_mysql_upgrade_skip-sys-schema)
  option suppresses this behavior.
- [`--socket=path`](mysql-upgrade.md#option_mysql_upgrade_socket),
  `-S path`

  |  |  |
  | --- | --- |
  | Command-Line Format | `--socket={file_name|pipe_name}` |
  | Type | String |

  For connections to `localhost`, the Unix
  socket file to use, or, on Windows, the name of the named
  pipe to use.

  On Windows, this option applies only if the server was
  started with the [`named_pipe`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_named_pipe)
  system variable enabled to support named-pipe connections.
  In addition, the user making the connection must be a member
  of the Windows group specified by the
  [`named_pipe_full_access_group`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_named_pipe_full_access_group)
  system variable.
- `--ssl*`

  Options that begin with `--ssl` specify
  whether to connect to the server using encryption and
  indicate where to find SSL keys and certificates. See
  [Command Options for Encrypted Connections](connection-options.md#encrypted-connection-options "Command Options for Encrypted Connections").
- [`--ssl-fips-mode={OFF|ON|STRICT}`](mysql-upgrade.md#option_mysql_upgrade_ssl-fips-mode)

  |  |  |
  | --- | --- |
  | Command-Line Format | `--ssl-fips-mode={OFF|ON|STRICT}` |
  | Deprecated | 8.0.34 |
  | Type | Enumeration |
  | Default Value | `OFF` |
  | Valid Values | `OFF`  `ON`  `STRICT` |

  Controls whether to enable FIPS mode on the client side. The
  [`--ssl-fips-mode`](mysql-upgrade.md#option_mysql_upgrade_ssl-fips-mode) option
  differs from other
  `--ssl-xxx`
  options in that it is not used to establish encrypted
  connections, but rather to affect which cryptographic
  operations to permit. See [Section 8.8, “FIPS Support”](fips-mode.md "8.8 FIPS Support").

  These [`--ssl-fips-mode`](mysql-upgrade.md#option_mysql_upgrade_ssl-fips-mode)
  values are permitted:

  - `OFF`: Disable FIPS mode.
  - `ON`: Enable FIPS mode.
  - `STRICT`: Enable “strict”
    FIPS mode.

  Note

  If the OpenSSL FIPS Object Module is not available, the
  only permitted value for
  [`--ssl-fips-mode`](mysql-upgrade.md#option_mysql_upgrade_ssl-fips-mode) is
  `OFF`. In this case, setting
  [`--ssl-fips-mode`](mysql-upgrade.md#option_mysql_upgrade_ssl-fips-mode) to
  `ON` or `STRICT` causes
  the client to produce a warning at startup and to operate
  in non-FIPS mode.

  As of MySQL 8.0.34, this option is deprecated. Expect it to
  be removed in a future version of MySQL.
- [`--tls-ciphersuites=ciphersuite_list`](mysql-upgrade.md#option_mysql_upgrade_tls-ciphersuites)

  |  |  |
  | --- | --- |
  | Command-Line Format | `--tls-ciphersuites=ciphersuite_list` |
  | Introduced | 8.0.16 |
  | Type | String |

  The permissible ciphersuites for encrypted connections that
  use TLSv1.3. The value is a list of one or more
  colon-separated ciphersuite names. The ciphersuites that can
  be named for this option depend on the SSL library used to
  compile MySQL. For details, see
  [Section 8.3.2, “Encrypted Connection TLS Protocols and Ciphers”](encrypted-connection-protocols-ciphers.md "8.3.2 Encrypted Connection TLS Protocols and Ciphers").

  This option was added in MySQL 8.0.16.
- [`--tls-version=protocol_list`](mysql-upgrade.md#option_mysql_upgrade_tls-version)

  |  |  |
  | --- | --- |
  | Command-Line Format | `--tls-version=protocol_list` |
  | Type | String |
  | Default Value (≥ 8.0.16) | `TLSv1,TLSv1.1,TLSv1.2,TLSv1.3` (OpenSSL 1.1.1 or higher)  `TLSv1,TLSv1.1,TLSv1.2` (otherwise) |
  | Default Value (≤ 8.0.15) | `TLSv1,TLSv1.1,TLSv1.2` |

  The permissible TLS protocols for encrypted connections. The
  value is a list of one or more comma-separated protocol
  names. The protocols that can be named for this option
  depend on the SSL library used to compile MySQL. For
  details, see
  [Section 8.3.2, “Encrypted Connection TLS Protocols and Ciphers”](encrypted-connection-protocols-ciphers.md "8.3.2 Encrypted Connection TLS Protocols and Ciphers").
- [`--upgrade-system-tables`](mysql-upgrade.md#option_mysql_upgrade_upgrade-system-tables),
  `-s`

  |  |  |
  | --- | --- |
  | Command-Line Format | `--upgrade-system-tables` |
  | Type | Boolean |

  Upgrade only the system tables in the
  `mysql` schema, do not upgrade user
  schemas.
- [`--user=user_name`](mysql-upgrade.md#option_mysql_upgrade_user),
  `-u user_name`

  |  |  |
  | --- | --- |
  | Command-Line Format | `--user=name` |
  | Type | String |

  The user name of the MySQL account to use for connecting to
  the server. The default user name is
  `root`.
- [`--verbose`](mysql-upgrade.md#option_mysql_upgrade_verbose)

  |  |  |
  | --- | --- |
  | Command-Line Format | `--verbose` |
  | Type | Boolean |

  Verbose mode. Print more information about what the program
  does.
- [`--version-check`](mysql-upgrade.md#option_mysql_upgrade_version-check),
  `-k`

  |  |  |
  | --- | --- |
  | Command-Line Format | `--version-check` |
  | Type | Boolean |

  Check the version of the server to which
  [**mysql\_upgrade**](mysql-upgrade.md "6.4.5 mysql_upgrade — Check and Upgrade MySQL Tables") is connecting to verify
  that it is the same as the version for which
  [**mysql\_upgrade**](mysql-upgrade.md "6.4.5 mysql_upgrade — Check and Upgrade MySQL Tables") was built. If not,
  [**mysql\_upgrade**](mysql-upgrade.md "6.4.5 mysql_upgrade — Check and Upgrade MySQL Tables") exits. This option is
  enabled by default; to disable the check, use
  `--skip-version-check`.
- [`--write-binlog`](mysql-upgrade.md#option_mysql_upgrade_write-binlog)

  |  |  |
  | --- | --- |
  | Command-Line Format | `--write-binlog` |
  | Type | Boolean |
  | Default Value | `OFF` |

  By default, binary logging by
  [**mysql\_upgrade**](mysql-upgrade.md "6.4.5 mysql_upgrade — Check and Upgrade MySQL Tables") is disabled. Invoke the
  program with
  [`--write-binlog`](mysql-upgrade.md#option_mysql_upgrade_write-binlog) if you
  want its actions to be written to the binary log.

  When the server is running with global transaction
  identifiers (GTIDs) enabled
  ([`gtid_mode=ON`](replication-options-gtids.md#sysvar_gtid_mode)), do not
  enable binary logging by [**mysql\_upgrade**](mysql-upgrade.md "6.4.5 mysql_upgrade — Check and Upgrade MySQL Tables").
- [`--zstd-compression-level=level`](mysql-upgrade.md#option_mysql_upgrade_zstd-compression-level)

  |  |  |
  | --- | --- |
  | Command-Line Format | `--zstd-compression-level=#` |
  | Introduced | 8.0.18 |
  | Type | Integer |

  The compression level to use for connections to the server
  that use the `zstd` compression algorithm.
  The permitted levels are from 1 to 22, with larger values
  indicating increasing levels of compression. The default
  `zstd` compression level is 3. The
  compression level setting has no effect on connections that
  do not use `zstd` compression.

  For more information, see
  [Section 6.2.8, “Connection Compression Control”](connection-compression-control.md "6.2.8 Connection Compression Control").

  This option was added in MySQL 8.0.18.
