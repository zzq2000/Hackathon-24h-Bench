#### 7.1.12.1 Connection Interfaces

This section describes aspects of how the MySQL server manages
client connections.

- [Network Interfaces and Connection Manager Threads](connection-interfaces.md#connection-interfaces-interfaces "Network Interfaces and Connection Manager Threads")
- [Client Connection Thread Management](connection-interfaces.md#connection-interfaces-thread-management "Client Connection Thread Management")
- [Connection Volume Management](connection-interfaces.md#connection-interfaces-volume-management "Connection Volume Management")

##### Network Interfaces and Connection Manager Threads

The server is capable of listening for client connections on
multiple network interfaces. Connection manager threads handle
client connection requests on the network interfaces that the
server listens to:

- On all platforms, one manager thread handles TCP/IP
  connection requests.
- On Unix, the same manager thread also handles Unix socket
  file connection requests.
- On Windows, one manager thread handles shared-memory
  connection requests, and another handles named-pipe
  connection requests.
- On all platforms, an additional network interface may be
  enabled to accept administrative TCP/IP connection
  requests. This interface can use the manager thread that
  handles “ordinary” TCP/IP requests, or a
  separate thread.

The server does not create threads to handle interfaces that
it does not listen to. For example, a Windows server that does
not have support for named-pipe connections enabled does not
create a thread to handle them.

Individual server plugins or components may implement their
own connection interface:

- X Plugin enables MySQL Server to communicate with clients
  using X Protocol. See [Section 22.5, “X Plugin”](x-plugin.md "22.5 X Plugin").

##### Client Connection Thread Management

Connection manager threads associate each client connection
with a thread dedicated to it that handles authentication and
request processing for that connection. Manager threads create
a new thread when necessary but try to avoid doing so by
consulting the thread cache first to see whether it contains a
thread that can be used for the connection. When a connection
ends, its thread is returned to the thread cache if the cache
is not full.

In this connection thread model, there are as many threads as
there are clients currently connected, which has some
disadvantages when server workload must scale to handle large
numbers of connections. For example, thread creation and
disposal becomes expensive. Also, each thread requires server
and kernel resources, such as stack space. To accommodate a
large number of simultaneous connections, the stack size per
thread must be kept small, leading to a situation where it is
either too small or the server consumes large amounts of
memory. Exhaustion of other resources can occur as well, and
scheduling overhead can become significant.

MySQL Enterprise Edition includes a thread pool plugin that provides an
alternative thread-handling model designed to reduce overhead
and improve performance. It implements a thread pool that
increases server performance by efficiently managing statement
execution threads for large numbers of client connections. See
[Section 7.6.3, “MySQL Enterprise Thread Pool”](thread-pool.md "7.6.3 MySQL Enterprise Thread Pool").

To control and monitor how the server manages threads that
handle client connections, several system and status variables
are relevant. (See [Section 7.1.8, “Server System Variables”](server-system-variables.md "7.1.8 Server System Variables"),
and [Section 7.1.10, “Server Status Variables”](server-status-variables.md "7.1.10 Server Status Variables").)

- The [`thread_cache_size`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_thread_cache_size)
  system variable determines the thread cache size. By
  default, the server autosizes the value at startup, but it
  can be set explicitly to override this default. A value of
  0 disables caching, which causes a thread to be set up for
  each new connection and disposed of when the connection
  terminates. To enable *`N`*
  inactive connection threads to be cached, set
  [`thread_cache_size`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_thread_cache_size) to
  *`N`* at server startup or at
  runtime. A connection thread becomes inactive when the
  client connection with which it was associated terminates.
- To monitor the number of threads in the cache and how many
  threads have been created because a thread could not be
  taken from the cache, check the
  [`Threads_cached`](server-status-variables.md#statvar_Threads_cached) and
  [`Threads_created`](server-status-variables.md#statvar_Threads_created) status
  variables.
- When the thread stack is too small, this limits the
  complexity of the SQL statements the server can handle,
  the recursion depth of stored procedures, and other
  memory-consuming actions. To set a stack size of
  *`N`* bytes for each thread, start
  the server with
  [`thread_stack`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_thread_stack) set to
  *`N`*.

##### Connection Volume Management

To control the maximum number of clients the server permits to
connect simultaneously, set the
[`max_connections`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_max_connections) system
variable at server startup or at runtime. It may be necessary
to increase [`max_connections`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_max_connections)
if more clients attempt to connect simultaneously then the
server is configured to handle (see
[Section B.3.2.5, “Too many connections”](too-many-connections.md "B.3.2.5 Too many connections")). If the server refuses
a connection because the
[`max_connections`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_max_connections) limit is
reached, it increments the
[`Connection_errors_max_connections`](server-status-variables.md#statvar_Connection_errors_max_connections)
status variable.

[**mysqld**](mysqld.md "6.3.1 mysqld — The MySQL Server") actually permits
[`max_connections`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_max_connections)
+ 1 client connections. The extra connection is reserved for
use by accounts that have the
[`CONNECTION_ADMIN`](privileges-provided.md#priv_connection-admin) privilege (or
the deprecated [`SUPER`](privileges-provided.md#priv_super)
privilege). By granting the privilege to administrators and
not to normal users (who should not need it), an administrator
can connect to the server and use [`SHOW
PROCESSLIST`](show-processlist.md "15.7.7.29 SHOW PROCESSLIST Statement") to diagnose problems even if the maximum
number of unprivileged clients are connected. See
[Section 15.7.7.29, “SHOW PROCESSLIST Statement”](show-processlist.md "15.7.7.29 SHOW PROCESSLIST Statement").

As of MySQL 8.0.14, the server also permits administrative
connections on an administrative network interface, which you
can set up using a dedicated IP address and port. See
[Section 7.1.12.2, “Administrative Connection Management”](administrative-connection-interface.md "7.1.12.2 Administrative Connection Management").

The Group Replication plugin interacts with MySQL Server using
internal sessions to perform SQL API operations. In releases
to MySQL 8.0.18, these sessions count towards the client
connections limit specified by the
[`max_connections`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_max_connections) server system
variable. In those releases, if the server has reached the
[`max_connections`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_max_connections) limit when
Group Replication is started or attempts to perform an
operation, the operation is unsuccessful and Group Replication
or the server itself might stop. From MySQL 8.0.19, Group
Replication's internal sessions are handled separately from
client connections, so they do not count towards the
[`max_connections`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_max_connections) limit and are
not refused if the server has reached this limit.

The maximum number of client connections MySQL supports (that
is, the maximum value to which
[`max_connections`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_max_connections) can be set)
depends on several factors:

- The quality of the thread library on a given platform.
- The amount of RAM available.
- The amount of RAM is used for each connection.
- The workload from each connection.
- The desired response time.
- The number of file descriptors available.

Linux or Solaris should be able to support at least 500 to
1000 simultaneous connections routinely and as many as 10,000
connections if you have many gigabytes of RAM available and
the workload from each is low or the response time target
undemanding.

Increasing the
[`max_connections`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_max_connections) value
increases the number of file descriptors that
[**mysqld**](mysqld.md "6.3.1 mysqld — The MySQL Server") requires. If the required number of
descriptors are not available, the server reduces the value of
[`max_connections`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_max_connections). For comments
on file descriptor limits, see [Section 10.4.3.1, “How MySQL Opens and Closes Tables”](table-cache.md "10.4.3.1 How MySQL Opens and Closes Tables").

Increasing the
[`open_files_limit`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_open_files_limit) system
variable may be necessary, which may also require raising the
operating system limit on how many file descriptors can be
used by MySQL. Consult your operating system documentation to
determine whether it is possible to increase the limit and how
to do so. See also [Section B.3.2.16, “File Not Found and Similar Errors”](not-enough-file-handles.md "B.3.2.16 File Not Found and Similar Errors").
