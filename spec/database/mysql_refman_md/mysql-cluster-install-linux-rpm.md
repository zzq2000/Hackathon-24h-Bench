#### 25.3.1.2 Installing NDB Cluster from RPM

This section covers the steps necessary to install the correct
executables for each type of NDB Cluster 8.0 node using RPM
packages supplied by Oracle.

As an alternative to the method described in this section,
Oracle provides MySQL Repositories for NDB Cluster that are
compatible with many common Linux distributions. Two
repositories, listed here, are available for RPM-based
distributions:

- For distributions using **yum**
  or **dnf**, you can use the
  MySQL Yum Repository for NDB Cluster. See
  [*Installing
  MySQL NDB Cluster Using the Yum
  Repository*](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/mysql-yum-repo-quick-guide/en/#repo-qg-yum-fresh-cluster-install), for instructions and
  additional information.
- For SLES, you can use the MySQL SLES Repository for NDB
  Cluster. See
  [*Installing
  MySQL NDB Cluster Using the SLES
  Repository*](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/mysql-sles-repo-quick-guide/en/#repo-qg-sles-fresh-cluster-install), for instructions and
  additional information.

RPMs are available for both 32-bit and 64-bit Linux platforms.
The filenames for these RPMs use the following pattern:

```simple
mysql-cluster-community-data-node-8.0.43-1.el7.x86_64.rpm

mysql-cluster-license-component-ver-rev.distro.arch.rpm

    license:= {commercial | community}

    component: {management-server | data-node | server | client | other—see text}

    ver: major.minor.release

    rev: major[.minor]

    distro: {el6 | el7 | sles12}

    arch: {i686 | x86_64}
```

*`license`* indicates whether the RPM is
part of a Commercial or Community release of NDB Cluster. In the
remainder of this section, we assume for the examples that you
are installing a Community release.

Possible values for *`component`*, with
descriptions, can be found in the following table:

**Table 25.6 Components of the NDB Cluster RPM distribution**

| Component | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `auto-installer` (DEPRECATED) | NDB Cluster Auto Installer program; see [Section 25.3.8, “The NDB Cluster Auto-Installer (NO LONGER SUPPORTED)”](mysql-cluster-installer.md "25.3.8 The NDB Cluster Auto-Installer (NO LONGER SUPPORTED)"), for usage |
| `client` | MySQL and `NDB` client programs; includes [**mysql**](mysql.md "6.5.1 mysql — The MySQL Command-Line Client") client, [**ndb\_mgm**](mysql-cluster-programs-ndb-mgm.md "25.5.5 ndb_mgm — The NDB Cluster Management Client") client, and other client tools |
| `common` | Character set and error message information needed by the MySQL server |
| `data-node` | [**ndbd**](mysql-cluster-programs-ndbd.md "25.5.1 ndbd — The NDB Cluster Data Node Daemon") and [**ndbmtd**](mysql-cluster-programs-ndbmtd.md "25.5.3 ndbmtd — The NDB Cluster Data Node Daemon (Multi-Threaded)") data node binaries |
| `devel` | Headers and library files needed for MySQL client development |
| `embedded` | Embedded MySQL server |
| `embedded-compat` | Backwards-compatible embedded MySQL server |
| `embedded-devel` | Header and library files for developing applications for embedded MySQL |
| `java` | JAR files needed for support of ClusterJ applications |
| `libs` | MySQL client libraries |
| `libs-compat` | Backwards-compatible MySQL client libraries |
| `management-server` | The NDB Cluster management server ([**ndb\_mgmd**](mysql-cluster-programs-ndb-mgmd.md "25.5.4 ndb_mgmd — The NDB Cluster Management Server Daemon")) |
| `memcached` | Files needed to support `ndbmemcache` |
| `minimal-debuginfo` | Debug information for package server-minimal; useful when developing applications that use this package or when debugging this package |
| `ndbclient` | `NDB` client library for running NDB API and MGM API applications (`libndbclient`) |
| `ndbclient-devel` | Header and other files needed for developing NDB API and MGM API applications |
| `nodejs` | Files needed to set up Node.JS support for NDB Cluster |
| `server` | The MySQL server ([**mysqld**](mysqld.md "6.3.1 mysqld — The MySQL Server")) with `NDB` storage engine support included, and associated MySQL server programs |
| `server-minimal` | Minimal installation of the MySQL server for NDB and related tools |
| `test` | **mysqltest**, other MySQL test programs, and support files |

A single bundle (`.tar` file) of all NDB
Cluster RPMs for a given platform and architecture is also
available. The name of this file follows the pattern shown here:

```simple
mysql-cluster-license-ver-rev.distro.arch.rpm-bundle.tar
```

You can extract the individual RPM files from this file using
**tar** or your preferred tool for extracting
archives.

The components required to install the three major types of NDB
Cluster nodes are given in the following list:

- *Management node*:
  `management-server`
- *Data node*: `data-node`
- *SQL node*: `server` and
  `common`

In addition, the `client` RPM should be
installed to provide the [**ndb\_mgm**](mysql-cluster-programs-ndb-mgm.md "25.5.5 ndb_mgm — The NDB Cluster Management Client") management
client on at least one management node. You may also wish to
install it on SQL nodes, to have [**mysql**](mysql.md "6.5.1 mysql — The MySQL Command-Line Client") and
other MySQL client programs available on these. We discuss
installation of nodes by type later in this section.

*`ver`* represents the three-part
`NDB` storage engine version number in
8.0.*`x`* format, shown as
`8.0.43` in the examples.
`rev` provides the RPM revision number in
*`major`*.*`minor`*
format. In the examples shown in this section, we use
`1.1` for this value.

The *`distro`* (Linux distribution) is
one of `rhel5` (Oracle Linux 5, Red Hat
Enterprise Linux 4 and 5), `el6` (Oracle Linux
6, Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6), `el7` (Oracle
Linux 7, Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7), or
`sles12` (SUSE Enterprise Linux 12). For the
examples in this section, we assume that the host runs Oracle
Linux 7, Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7, or the equivalent
(`el7`).

*`arch`* is `i686` for
32-bit RPMs and `x86_64` for 64-bit versions.
In the examples shown here, we assume a 64-bit platform.

The NDB Cluster version number in the RPM file names (shown here
as `8.0.43`) can vary
according to the version which you are actually using.
*It is very important that all of the Cluster RPMs to
be installed have the same version number*. The
architecture should also be appropriate to the machine on which
the RPM is to be installed; in particular, you should keep in
mind that 64-bit RPMs (`x86_64`) cannot be used
with 32-bit operating systems (use `i686` for
the latter).

**Data nodes.**
On a computer that is to host an NDB Cluster data node it is
necessary to install only the `data-node`
RPM. To do so, copy this RPM to the data node host, and run
the following command as the system root user, replacing the
name shown for the RPM as necessary to match that of the RPM
downloaded from the MySQL website:

```terminal
$> rpm -Uhv mysql-cluster-community-data-node-8.0.43-1.el7.x86_64.rpm
```

This installs the [**ndbd**](mysql-cluster-programs-ndbd.md "25.5.1 ndbd — The NDB Cluster Data Node Daemon") and
[**ndbmtd**](mysql-cluster-programs-ndbmtd.md "25.5.3 ndbmtd — The NDB Cluster Data Node Daemon (Multi-Threaded)") data node binaries in
`/usr/sbin`. Either of these can be used to
run a data node process on this host.

**SQL nodes.**
Copy the `server` and
`common` RPMs to each machine to be used for
hosting an NDB Cluster SQL node (`server`
requires `common`). Install the
`server` RPM by executing the following
command as the system root user, replacing the name shown for
the RPM as necessary to match the name of the RPM downloaded
from the MySQL website:

```terminal
$> rpm -Uhv mysql-cluster-community-server-8.0.43-1.el7.x86_64.rpm
```

This installs the MySQL server binary
([**mysqld**](mysqld.md "6.3.1 mysqld — The MySQL Server")), with `NDB` storage
engine support, in the `/usr/sbin` directory.
It also installs all needed MySQL Server support files and
useful MySQL server programs, including the
[**mysql.server**](mysql-server.md "6.3.3 mysql.server — MySQL Server Startup Script") and
[**mysqld\_safe**](mysqld-safe.md "6.3.2 mysqld_safe — MySQL Server Startup Script") startup scripts (in
`/usr/share/mysql` and
`/usr/bin`, respectively). The RPM installer
should take care of general configuration issues (such as
creating the `mysql` user and group, if needed)
automatically.

Important

You must use the versions of these RPMs released for NDB
Cluster; those released for the standard MySQL server do not
provide support for the `NDB` storage engine.

To administer the SQL node (MySQL server), you should also
install the `client` RPM, as shown here:

```terminal
$> rpm -Uhv mysql-cluster-community-client-8.0.43-1.el7.x86_64.rpm
```

This installs the [**mysql**](mysql.md "6.5.1 mysql — The MySQL Command-Line Client") client and other
MySQL client programs, such as [**mysqladmin**](mysqladmin.md "6.5.2 mysqladmin — A MySQL Server Administration Program") and
[**mysqldump**](mysqldump.md "6.5.4 mysqldump — A Database Backup Program"), to `/usr/bin`.

**Management nodes.**
To install the NDB Cluster management server, it is necessary
only to use the `management-server` RPM. Copy
this RPM to the computer intended to host the management node,
and then install it by running the following command as the
system root user (replace the name shown for the RPM as
necessary to match that of the
`management-server` RPM downloaded from the
MySQL website):

```terminal
$> rpm -Uhv mysql-cluster-community-management-server-8.0.43-1.el7.x86_64.rpm
```

This RPM installs the management server binary
[**ndb\_mgmd**](mysql-cluster-programs-ndb-mgmd.md "25.5.4 ndb_mgmd — The NDB Cluster Management Server Daemon") in the
`/usr/sbin` directory. While this is the only
program actually required for running a management node, it is
also a good idea to have the [**ndb\_mgm**](mysql-cluster-programs-ndb-mgm.md "25.5.5 ndb_mgm — The NDB Cluster Management Client") NDB
Cluster management client available as well. You can obtain this
program, as well as other `NDB` client programs
such as [**ndb\_desc**](mysql-cluster-programs-ndb-desc.md "25.5.9 ndb_desc — Describe NDB Tables") and
[**ndb\_config**](mysql-cluster-programs-ndb-config.md "25.5.7 ndb_config — Extract NDB Cluster Configuration Information"), by installing the
`client` RPM as described previously.

See [Section 2.5.4, “Installing MySQL on Linux Using RPM Packages from Oracle”](linux-installation-rpm.md "2.5.4 Installing MySQL on Linux Using RPM Packages from Oracle"), for general
information about installing MySQL using RPMs supplied by
Oracle.

After installing from RPM, you still need to configure the
cluster; see
[Section 25.3.3, “Initial Configuration of NDB Cluster”](mysql-cluster-install-configuration.md "25.3.3 Initial Configuration of NDB Cluster"), for the
relevant information.

*It is very important that all of the Cluster RPMs to
be installed have the same version number*. The
*`architecture`* designation should also
be appropriate to the machine on which the RPM is to be
installed; in particular, you should keep in mind that 64-bit
RPMs cannot be used with 32-bit operating systems.

**Data nodes.**
On a computer that is to host a cluster data node it is
necessary to install only the `server` RPM.
To do so, copy this RPM to the data node host, and run the
following command as the system root user, replacing the name
shown for the RPM as necessary to match that of the RPM
downloaded from the MySQL website:

```terminal
$> rpm -Uhv MySQL-Cluster-server-gpl-8.0.43-1.sles11.i386.rpm
```

Although this installs all NDB Cluster binaries, only the
program [**ndbd**](mysql-cluster-programs-ndbd.md "25.5.1 ndbd — The NDB Cluster Data Node Daemon") or [**ndbmtd**](mysql-cluster-programs-ndbmtd.md "25.5.3 ndbmtd — The NDB Cluster Data Node Daemon (Multi-Threaded)")
(both in `/usr/sbin`) is actually needed to
run an NDB Cluster data node.

**SQL nodes.**
On each machine to be used for hosting a cluster SQL node,
install the `server` RPM by executing the
following command as the system root user, replacing the name
shown for the RPM as necessary to match the name of the RPM
downloaded from the MySQL website:

```terminal
$> rpm -Uhv MySQL-Cluster-server-gpl-8.0.43-1.sles11.i386.rpm
```

This installs the MySQL server binary
([**mysqld**](mysqld.md "6.3.1 mysqld — The MySQL Server")) with
[`NDB`](mysql-cluster.md "Chapter 25 MySQL NDB Cluster 8.0") storage engine support in the
`/usr/sbin` directory, as well as all needed
MySQL Server support files. It also installs the
[**mysql.server**](mysql-server.md "6.3.3 mysql.server — MySQL Server Startup Script") and
[**mysqld\_safe**](mysqld-safe.md "6.3.2 mysqld_safe — MySQL Server Startup Script") startup scripts (in
`/usr/share/mysql` and
`/usr/bin`, respectively). The RPM installer
should take care of general configuration issues (such as
creating the `mysql` user and group, if needed)
automatically.

To administer the SQL node (MySQL server), you should also
install the `client` RPM, as shown here:

```terminal
$> rpm -Uhv MySQL-Cluster-client-gpl-8.0.43-1.sles11.i386.rpm
```

This installs the [**mysql**](mysql.md "6.5.1 mysql — The MySQL Command-Line Client") client program.

**Management nodes.**
To install the NDB Cluster management server, it is necessary
only to use the `server` RPM. Copy this RPM
to the computer intended to host the management node, and then
install it by running the following command as the system root
user (replace the name shown for the RPM as necessary to match
that of the `server` RPM downloaded from the
MySQL website):

```terminal
$> rpm -Uhv MySQL-Cluster-server-gpl-8.0.43-1.sles11.i386.rpm
```

Although this RPM installs many other files, only the management
server binary [**ndb\_mgmd**](mysql-cluster-programs-ndb-mgmd.md "25.5.4 ndb_mgmd — The NDB Cluster Management Server Daemon") (in the
`/usr/sbin` directory) is actually required
for running a management node. The `server` RPM
also installs [**ndb\_mgm**](mysql-cluster-programs-ndb-mgm.md "25.5.5 ndb_mgm — The NDB Cluster Management Client"), the
[`NDB`](mysql-cluster.md "Chapter 25 MySQL NDB Cluster 8.0") management client.

See [Section 2.5.4, “Installing MySQL on Linux Using RPM Packages from Oracle”](linux-installation-rpm.md "2.5.4 Installing MySQL on Linux Using RPM Packages from Oracle"), for general
information about installing MySQL using RPMs supplied by
Oracle. See
[Section 25.3.3, “Initial Configuration of NDB Cluster”](mysql-cluster-install-configuration.md "25.3.3 Initial Configuration of NDB Cluster"), for
