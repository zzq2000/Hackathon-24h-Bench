MySQL Server includes a component-based infrastructure for extending
server capabilities. A component provides services that are
available to the server and other components. (With respect to
service use, the server is a component, equal to other components.)
Components interact with each other only through the services they
provide.

MySQL distributions include several components that implement server
extensions:

- Components for configuring error logging. See
  [Section 7.4.2, “The Error Log”](error-log.md "7.4.2 The Error Log"), and
  [Section 7.5.3, “Error Log Components”](error-log-components.md "7.5.3 Error Log Components").
- A component for checking passwords. See
  [Section 8.4.3, “The Password Validation Component”](validate-password.md "8.4.3 The Password Validation Component").
- Keyring components provide secure storage for sensitive
  information. See [Section 8.4.4, “The MySQL Keyring”](keyring.md "8.4.4 The MySQL Keyring").
- A component that enables applications to add their own message
  events to the audit log. See
  [Section 8.4.6, “The Audit Message Component”](audit-api-message-emit.md "8.4.6 The Audit Message Component").
- A component that implements a loadable function for accessing
  query attributes. See [Section 11.6, “Query Attributes”](query-attributes.md "11.6 Query Attributes").
- A component for scheduling actively executing tasks. See
  [Section 7.5.5, “Scheduler Component”](scheduler-component.md "7.5.5 Scheduler Component").

System and status variables implemented by a component are exposed
when the component is installed and have names that begin with a
component-specific prefix. For example, the
`log_filter_dragnet` error log filter component
implements a system variable named
`log_error_filter_rules`, the full name of which is
[`dragnet.log_error_filter_rules`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_dragnet.log_error_filter_rules). To
refer to this variable, use the full name.

The following sections describe how to install and uninstall
components, and how to determine at runtime which components are
installed and obtain information about them.

For information about the internal implementation of components, see
the MySQL Server Doxygen documentation, available at
<https://dev.mysql.com/doc/index-other.html>. For example, if you
intend to write your own components, this information is important
for understanding how components work.
