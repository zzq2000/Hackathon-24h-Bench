#### 29.12.8.2 The hosts Table

The [`hosts`](performance-schema-hosts-table.md "29.12.8.2 The hosts Table") table contains a row
for each host from which clients have connected to the MySQL
server. For each host name, the table counts the current and
total number of connections. The table size is autosized at
server startup. To set the table size explicitly, set the
[`performance_schema_hosts_size`](performance-schema-system-variables.md#sysvar_performance_schema_hosts_size)
system variable at server startup. To disable host statistics,
set this variable to 0.

The [`hosts`](performance-schema-hosts-table.md "29.12.8.2 The hosts Table") table has the following
columns. For a description of how the Performance Schema
maintains rows in this table, including the effect of
[`TRUNCATE TABLE`](truncate-table.md "15.1.37 TRUNCATE TABLE Statement"), see
[Section 29.12.8, “Performance Schema Connection Tables”](performance-schema-connection-tables.md "29.12.8 Performance Schema Connection Tables").
