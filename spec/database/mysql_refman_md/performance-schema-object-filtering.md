### 29.4.5 Pre-Filtering by Object

The [`setup_objects`](performance-schema-setup-objects-table.md "29.12.2.4 The setup_objects Table") table controls
whether the Performance Schema monitors particular table and
stored program objects. The initial
[`setup_objects`](performance-schema-setup-objects-table.md "29.12.2.4 The setup_objects Table") contents look like
this:

```sql
mysql> SELECT * FROM performance_schema.setup_objects;
+-------------+--------------------+-------------+---------+-------+
| OBJECT_TYPE | OBJECT_SCHEMA      | OBJECT_NAME | ENABLED | TIMED |
+-------------+--------------------+-------------+---------+-------+
| EVENT       | mysql              | %           | NO      | NO    |
| EVENT       | performance_schema | %           | NO      | NO    |
| EVENT       | information_schema | %           | NO      | NO    |
| EVENT       | %                  | %           | YES     | YES   |

| PROCEDURE   | %                  | %           | YES     | YES   |
| TABLE       | mysql              | %           | NO      | NO    |
| TABLE       | performance_schema | %           | NO      | NO    |
| TABLE       | information_schema | %           | NO      | NO    |
| TABLE       | %                  | %           | YES     | YES   |
| TRIGGER     | mysql              | %           | NO      | NO    |
| TRIGGER     | performance_schema | %           | NO      | NO    |
| TRIGGER     | information_schema | %           | NO      | NO    |
| TRIGGER     | %                  | %           | YES     | YES   |
+-------------+--------------------+-------------+---------+-------+
```

Modifications to the [`setup_objects`](performance-schema-setup-objects-table.md "29.12.2.4 The setup_objects Table")
table affect object monitoring immediately.

The `OBJECT_TYPE` column indicates the type of
object to which a row applies. `TABLE`
filtering affects table I/O events
(`wait/io/table/sql/handler` instrument) and
table lock events
(`wait/lock/table/sql/handler` instrument).

The `OBJECT_SCHEMA` and
`OBJECT_NAME` columns should contain a literal
schema or object name, or `'%'` to match any
name.

The `ENABLED` column indicates whether matching
objects are monitored, and `TIMED` indicates
whether to collect timing information. Setting the
`TIMED` column affects Performance Schema table
contents as described in
[Section 29.4.1, “Performance Schema Event Timing”](performance-schema-timing.md "29.4.1 Performance Schema Event Timing").

The effect of the default object configuration is to instrument
all objects except those in the `mysql`,
`INFORMATION_SCHEMA`, and
`performance_schema` databases. (Tables in the
`INFORMATION_SCHEMA` database are not
instrumented regardless of the contents of
[`setup_objects`](performance-schema-setup-objects-table.md "29.12.2.4 The setup_objects Table"); the row for
`information_schema.%` simply makes this
default explicit.)

When the Performance Schema checks for a match in
[`setup_objects`](performance-schema-setup-objects-table.md "29.12.2.4 The setup_objects Table"), it tries to find
more specific matches first. For rows that match a given
`OBJECT_TYPE`, the Performance Schema checks
rows in this order:

- Rows with
  `OBJECT_SCHEMA='literal'`
  and
  `OBJECT_NAME='literal'`.
- Rows with
  `OBJECT_SCHEMA='literal'`
  and `OBJECT_NAME='%'`.
- Rows with `OBJECT_SCHEMA='%'` and
  `OBJECT_NAME='%'`.

For example, with a table `db1.t1`, the
Performance Schema looks in `TABLE` rows for a
match for `'db1'` and `'t1'`,
then for `'db1'` and `'%'`,
then for `'%'` and `'%'`. The
order in which matching occurs matters because different
matching [`setup_objects`](performance-schema-setup-objects-table.md "29.12.2.4 The setup_objects Table") rows can
have different `ENABLED` and
`TIMED` values.

For table-related events, the Performance Schema combines the
contents of [`setup_objects`](performance-schema-setup-objects-table.md "29.12.2.4 The setup_objects Table") with
[`setup_instruments`](performance-schema-setup-instruments-table.md "29.12.2.3 The setup_instruments Table") to determine
whether to enable instruments and whether to time enabled
instruments:

- For tables that match a row in
  [`setup_objects`](performance-schema-setup-objects-table.md "29.12.2.4 The setup_objects Table"), table
  instruments produce events only if
  `ENABLED` is `YES` in both
  [`setup_instruments`](performance-schema-setup-instruments-table.md "29.12.2.3 The setup_instruments Table") and
  [`setup_objects`](performance-schema-setup-objects-table.md "29.12.2.4 The setup_objects Table").
- The `TIMED` values in the two tables are
  combined, so that timing information is collected only when
  both values are `YES`.

For stored program objects, the Performance Schema takes the
`ENABLED` and `TIMED` columns
directly from the [`setup_objects`](performance-schema-setup-objects-table.md "29.12.2.4 The setup_objects Table")
row. There is no combining of values with
[`setup_instruments`](performance-schema-setup-instruments-table.md "29.12.2.3 The setup_instruments Table").

Suppose that [`setup_objects`](performance-schema-setup-objects-table.md "29.12.2.4 The setup_objects Table") contains
the following `TABLE` rows that apply to
`db1`, `db2`, and
`db3`:

```sql
+-------------+---------------+-------------+---------+-------+
| OBJECT_TYPE | OBJECT_SCHEMA | OBJECT_NAME | ENABLED | TIMED |
+-------------+---------------+-------------+---------+-------+
| TABLE       | db1           | t1          | YES     | YES   |
| TABLE       | db1           | t2          | NO      | NO    |
| TABLE       | db2           | %           | YES     | YES   |
| TABLE       | db3           | %           | NO      | NO    |
| TABLE       | %             | %           | YES     | YES   |
+-------------+---------------+-------------+---------+-------+
```

If an object-related instrument in
[`setup_instruments`](performance-schema-setup-instruments-table.md "29.12.2.3 The setup_instruments Table") has an
`ENABLED` value of `NO`,
events for the object are not monitored. If the
`ENABLED` value is `YES`,
event monitoring occurs according to the
`ENABLED` value in the relevant
[`setup_objects`](performance-schema-setup-objects-table.md "29.12.2.4 The setup_objects Table") row:

- `db1.t1` events are monitored
- `db1.t2` events are not monitored
- `db2.t3` events are monitored
- `db3.t4` events are not monitored
- `db4.t5` events are monitored

Similar logic applies for combining the `TIMED`
columns from the [`setup_instruments`](performance-schema-setup-instruments-table.md "29.12.2.3 The setup_instruments Table")
and [`setup_objects`](performance-schema-setup-objects-table.md "29.12.2.4 The setup_objects Table") tables to
determine whether to collect event timing information.

If a persistent table and a temporary table have the same name,
matching against [`setup_objects`](performance-schema-setup-objects-table.md "29.12.2.4 The setup_objects Table") rows
occurs the same way for both. It is not possible to enable
monitoring for one table but not the other. However, each table
is instrumented separately.
