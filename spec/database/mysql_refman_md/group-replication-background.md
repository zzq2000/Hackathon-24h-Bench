This section provides background information on MySQL Group
Replication.

The most common way to create a fault-tolerant system is to resort
to making components redundant, in other words the component can be
removed and the system should continue to operate as expected. This
creates a set of challenges that raise complexity of such systems to
a whole different level. Specifically, replicated databases have to
deal with the fact that they require maintenance and administration
of several servers instead of just one. Moreover, as servers are
cooperating together to create the group several other classic
distributed systems problems have to be dealt with, such as network
partitioning or split brain scenarios.

Therefore, the ultimate challenge is to fuse the logic of the
database and data replication with the logic of having several
servers coordinated in a consistent and simple way. In other words,
to have multiple servers agreeing on the state of the system and the
data on each and every change that the system goes through. This can
be summarized as having servers reaching agreement on each database
state transition, so that they all progress as one single database
or alternatively that they eventually converge to the same state.
Meaning that they need to operate as a (distributed) state machine.

MySQL Group Replication provides distributed state machine
replication with strong coordination between servers. Servers
coordinate themselves automatically when they are part of the same
group. The group can operate in a single-primary mode with automatic
primary election, where only one server accepts updates at a time.
Alternatively, for more advanced users the group can be deployed in
multi-primary mode, where all servers can accept updates, even if
they are issued concurrently. This power comes at the expense of
applications having to work around the limitations imposed by such
deployments.

There is a built-in group membership service that keeps the view of
the group consistent and available for all servers at any given
point in time. Servers can leave and join the group and the view is
updated accordingly. Sometimes servers can leave the group
unexpectedly, in which case the failure detection mechanism detects
this and notifies the group that the view has changed. This is all
automatic.

For a transaction to commit, the majority of the group have to agree
on the order of a given transaction in the global sequence of
transactions. Deciding to commit or abort a transaction is done by
each server individually, but all servers make the same decision. If
there is a network partition, resulting in a split where members are
unable to reach agreement, then the system does not progress until
this issue is resolved. Hence there is also a built-in, automatic,
split-brain protection mechanism.

All of this is powered by the provided Group Communication System
(GCS) protocols. These provide a failure detection mechanism, a
group membership service, and safe and completely ordered message
delivery. All these properties are key to creating a system which
ensures that data is consistently replicated across the group of
servers. At the very core of this technology lies an implementation
of the Paxos algorithm. It acts as the group communication engine.
