### 13.3.6 The SET Type

A `SET` is a string object that can have zero
or more values, each of which must be chosen from a list of
permitted values specified when the table is created.
`SET` column values that consist of multiple
set members are specified with members separated by commas
(`,`). A consequence of this is that
`SET` member values should not themselves
contain commas.

For example, a column specified as `SET('one', 'two')
NOT NULL` can have any of these values:

```simple
''
'one'
'two'
'one,two'
```

A [`SET`](set.md "13.3.6 The SET Type") column can have a maximum
of 64 distinct members.

Duplicate values in the definition cause a warning, or an error
if strict SQL mode is enabled.

Trailing spaces are automatically deleted from
`SET` member values in the table definition
when a table is created.

See [String Type Storage Requirements](storage-requirements.md#data-types-storage-reqs-strings "String Type Storage Requirements") for
storage requirements for the [`SET`](set.md "13.3.6 The SET Type")
type.

See [Section 13.3.1, “String Data Type Syntax”](string-type-syntax.md "13.3.1 String Data Type Syntax") for
[`SET`](set.md "13.3.6 The SET Type") type syntax and length
limits.

When retrieved, values stored in a `SET` column
are displayed using the lettercase that was used in the column
definition. Note that `SET` columns can be
assigned a character set and collation. For binary or
case-sensitive collations, lettercase is taken into account when
assigning values to the column.

MySQL stores `SET` values numerically, with the
low-order bit of the stored value corresponding to the first set
member. If you retrieve a `SET` value in a
numeric context, the value retrieved has bits set corresponding
to the set members that make up the column value. For example,
you can retrieve numeric values from a `SET`
column like this:

```sql
mysql> SELECT set_col+0 FROM tbl_name;
```

If a number is stored into a `SET` column, the
bits that are set in the binary representation of the number
determine the set members in the column value. For a column
specified as `SET('a','b','c','d')`, the
members have the following decimal and binary values.

| `SET` Member | Decimal Value | Binary Value |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `'a'` | `1` | `0001` |
| `'b'` | `2` | `0010` |
| `'c'` | `4` | `0100` |
| `'d'` | `8` | `1000` |

If you assign a value of `9` to this column,
that is `1001` in binary, so the first and
fourth `SET` value members
`'a'` and `'d'` are selected
and the resulting value is `'a,d'`.

For a value containing more than one `SET`
element, it does not matter what order the elements are listed
in when you insert the value. It also does not matter how many
times a given element is listed in the value. When the value is
retrieved later, each element in the value appears once, with
elements listed according to the order in which they were
specified at table creation time. Suppose that a column is
specified as `SET('a','b','c','d')`:

```sql
mysql> CREATE TABLE myset (col SET('a', 'b', 'c', 'd'));
```

If you insert the values `'a,d'`,
`'d,a'`, `'a,d,d'`,
`'a,d,a'`, and `'d,a,d'`:

```sql
mysql> INSERT INTO myset (col) VALUES
-> ('a,d'), ('d,a'), ('a,d,a'), ('a,d,d'), ('d,a,d');
Query OK, 5 rows affected (0.01 sec)
Records: 5  Duplicates: 0  Warnings: 0
```

Then all these values appear as `'a,d'` when
retrieved:

```sql
mysql> SELECT col FROM myset;
+------+
| col  |
+------+
| a,d  |
| a,d  |
| a,d  |
| a,d  |
| a,d  |
+------+
5 rows in set (0.04 sec)
```

If you set a `SET` column to an unsupported
value, the value is ignored and a warning is issued:

```sql
mysql> INSERT INTO myset (col) VALUES ('a,d,d,s');
Query OK, 1 row affected, 1 warning (0.03 sec)

mysql> SHOW WARNINGS;
+---------+------+------------------------------------------+
| Level   | Code | Message                                  |
+---------+------+------------------------------------------+
| Warning | 1265 | Data truncated for column 'col' at row 1 |
+---------+------+------------------------------------------+
1 row in set (0.04 sec)

mysql> SELECT col FROM myset;
+------+
| col  |
+------+
| a,d  |
| a,d  |
| a,d  |
| a,d  |
| a,d  |
| a,d  |
+------+
6 rows in set (0.01 sec)
```

If strict SQL mode is enabled, attempts to insert invalid
`SET` values result in an error.

`SET` values are sorted numerically.
`NULL` values sort before
non-`NULL` `SET` values.

Functions such as [`SUM()`](aggregate-functions.md#function_sum) or
[`AVG()`](aggregate-functions.md#function_avg) that expect a numeric
argument cast the argument to a number if necessary. For
`SET` values, the cast operation causes the
numeric value to be used.

Normally, you search for `SET` values using the
[`FIND_IN_SET()`](string-functions.md#function_find-in-set) function or the
[`LIKE`](string-comparison-functions.md#operator_like) operator:

```sql
mysql> SELECT * FROM tbl_name WHERE FIND_IN_SET('value',set_col)>0;
mysql> SELECT * FROM tbl_name WHERE set_col LIKE '%value%';
```

The first statement finds rows where
*`set_col`* contains the
*`value`* set member. The second is
similar, but not the same: It finds rows where
*`set_col`* contains
*`value`* anywhere, even as a substring
of another set member.

The following statements also are permitted:

```sql
mysql> SELECT * FROM tbl_name WHERE set_col & 1;
mysql> SELECT * FROM tbl_name WHERE set_col = 'val1,val2';
```

The first of these statements looks for values containing the
first set member. The second looks for an exact match. Be
careful with comparisons of the second type. Comparing set
values to
`'val1,val2'`
returns different results than comparing values to
`'val2,val1'`.
You should specify the values in the same order they are listed
in the column definition.

To determine all possible values for a `SET`
column, use `SHOW COLUMNS FROM
tbl_name LIKE
set_col` and parse the
`SET` definition in the `Type`
column of the output.

In the C API, `SET` values are returned as
strings. For information about using result set metadata to
distinguish them from other strings, see
[C API Basic Data Structures](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/c-api/8.0/en/c-api-data-structures.html).
