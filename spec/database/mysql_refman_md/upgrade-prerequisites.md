## 3.6 Preparing Your Installation for Upgrade

Before upgrading to the latest MySQL 8.0 release,
ensure the upgrade readiness of your current MySQL
5.7 or MySQL 8.0 server instance by
performing the preliminary checks described below. The upgrade
process may fail otherwise.

Tip

Consider using the [MySQL Shell upgrade checker utility](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/mysql-shell/8.0/en/mysql-shell-utilities-upgrade.html) that enables you to verify whether MySQL server instances are ready for upgrade. You can select a target MySQL Server release to which you plan to upgrade, ranging from the MySQL Server 8.0.11 up to the MySQL Server release number that matches the current MySQL Shell release number. The upgrade checker utility carries out the automated checks that are relevant for the specified target release, and advises you of further relevant checks that you should make manually. The upgrade checker works for all Bugfix, Innovation, and LTS releases of MySQL. Installation instructions for MySQL Shell can be found [here](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/mysql-shell/8.0/en/mysql-shell-install.html).

Preliminary checks:

1. The following issues must not be present:

   - There must be no tables that use obsolete data types or
     functions.

     In-place upgrade to MySQL 8.0 is not supported if tables
     contain old temporal columns in pre-5.6.4 format
     ([`TIME`](time.md "13.2.3 The TIME Type"),
     [`DATETIME`](datetime.md "13.2.2 The DATE, DATETIME, and TIMESTAMP Types"), and
     [`TIMESTAMP`](datetime.md "13.2.2 The DATE, DATETIME, and TIMESTAMP Types") columns without
     support for fractional seconds precision). If your tables
     still use the old temporal column format, upgrade them
     using [`REPAIR TABLE`](repair-table.md "15.7.3.5 REPAIR TABLE Statement") before
     attempting an in-place upgrade to MySQL 8.0. For more
     information, see
     [Server Changes](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/upgrading-from-previous-series.html#upgrade-server-changes), in
     [MySQL 5.7 Reference Manual](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/).
   - There must be no orphan `.frm` files.
   - Triggers must not have a missing or empty definer or an
     invalid creation context (indicated by the
     `character_set_client`,
     `collation_connection`, `Database
     Collation` attributes displayed by
     [`SHOW TRIGGERS`](show-triggers.md "15.7.7.40 SHOW TRIGGERS Statement") or the
     `INFORMATION_SCHEMA`
     [`TRIGGERS`](information-schema-triggers-table.md "28.3.45 The INFORMATION_SCHEMA TRIGGERS Table") table). Any such
     triggers must be dumped and restored to fix the issue.

   To check for these issues, execute this command:

   ```terminal
   mysqlcheck -u root -p --all-databases --check-upgrade
   ```

   If [**mysqlcheck**](mysqlcheck.md "6.5.3 mysqlcheck — A Table Maintenance Program") reports any errors, correct
   the issues.
2. There must be no partitioned tables that use a storage engine
   that does not have native partitioning support. To identify
   such tables, execute this query:

   ```sql
   SELECT TABLE_SCHEMA, TABLE_NAME
   FROM INFORMATION_SCHEMA.TABLES
   WHERE ENGINE NOT IN ('innodb', 'ndbcluster')
   AND CREATE_OPTIONS LIKE '%partitioned%';
   ```

   Any table reported by the query must be altered to use
   `InnoDB` or be made nonpartitioned. To change
   a table storage engine to `InnoDB`, execute
   this statement:

   ```sql
   ALTER TABLE table_name ENGINE = INNODB;
   ```

   For information about converting `MyISAM`
   tables to `InnoDB`, see
   [Section 17.6.1.5, “Converting Tables from MyISAM to InnoDB”](converting-tables-to-innodb.md "17.6.1.5 Converting Tables from MyISAM to InnoDB").

   To make a partitioned table nonpartitioned, execute this
   statement:

   ```sql
   ALTER TABLE table_name REMOVE PARTITIONING;
   ```
3. Some keywords may be reserved in MySQL 8.0 that
   were not reserved previously. See [Section 11.3, “Keywords and Reserved Words”](keywords.md "11.3 Keywords and Reserved Words").
   This can cause words previously used as identifiers to become
   illegal. To fix affected statements, use identifier quoting.
   See [Section 11.2, “Schema Object Names”](identifiers.md "11.2 Schema Object Names").
4. There must be no tables in the MySQL 5.7
   `mysql` system database that have the same
   name as a table used by the MySQL 8.0 data
   dictionary. To identify tables with those names, execute this
   query:

   ```sql
   SELECT TABLE_SCHEMA, TABLE_NAME
   FROM INFORMATION_SCHEMA.TABLES
   WHERE LOWER(TABLE_SCHEMA) = 'mysql'
   and LOWER(TABLE_NAME) IN
   (
   'catalogs',
   'character_sets',
   'check_constraints',
   'collations',
   'column_statistics',
   'column_type_elements',
   'columns',
   'dd_properties',
   'events',
   'foreign_key_column_usage',
   'foreign_keys',
   'index_column_usage',
   'index_partitions',
   'index_stats',
   'indexes',
   'parameter_type_elements',
   'parameters',
   'resource_groups',
   'routines',
   'schemata',
   'st_spatial_reference_systems',
   'table_partition_values',
   'table_partitions',
   'table_stats',
   'tables',
   'tablespace_files',
   'tablespaces',
   'triggers',
   'view_routine_usage',
   'view_table_usage'
   );
   ```

   Any tables reported by the query must be dropped or renamed
   (use [`RENAME TABLE`](rename-table.md "15.1.36 RENAME TABLE Statement")). This may
   also entail changes to applications that use the affected
   tables.
5. There must be no tables that have foreign key constraint names
   longer than 64 characters. Use this query to identify tables
   with constraint names that are too long:

   ```sql
   SELECT TABLE_SCHEMA, TABLE_NAME
   FROM INFORMATION_SCHEMA.TABLES
   WHERE TABLE_NAME IN
     (SELECT LEFT(SUBSTR(ID,INSTR(ID,'/')+1),
                  INSTR(SUBSTR(ID,INSTR(ID,'/')+1),'_ibfk_')-1)
      FROM INFORMATION_SCHEMA.INNODB_SYS_FOREIGN
      WHERE CHAR_LENGTH(SUBSTR(ID,INSTR(ID,'/')+1))>64);
   ```

   For a table with a constraint name that exceeds 64 characters,
   drop the constraint and add it back with constraint name that
   does not exceed 64 characters (use [`ALTER
   TABLE`](alter-table.md "15.1.9 ALTER TABLE Statement")).
6. There must be no obsolete SQL modes defined by
   [`sql_mode`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_sql_mode) system variable.
   Attempting to use an obsolete SQL mode prevents MySQL
   8.0 from starting. Applications that use obsolete
   SQL modes should be revised to avoid them. For information
   about SQL modes removed in MySQL 8.0, see
   [Server Changes](upgrading-from-previous-series.md#upgrade-server-changes "Server Changes").
7. Only upgrade a MySQL server instance that was properly shut
   down. If the instance unexpectedly shutdown, then restart the
   instance and shut it down with
   [`innodb_fast_shutdown=0`](innodb-parameters.md#sysvar_innodb_fast_shutdown) before
   upgrade.
8. There must be no views with explicitly defined columns names
   that exceed 64 characters (views with column names up to 255
   characters were permitted in MySQL 5.7). To avoid upgrade
   errors, such views should be altered before upgrading.
   Currently, the only method of identify views with column names
   that exceed 64 characters is to inspect the view definition
   using [`SHOW CREATE VIEW`](show-create-view.md "15.7.7.13 SHOW CREATE VIEW Statement"). You can
   also inspect view definitions by querying the Information
   Schema [`VIEWS`](information-schema-views-table.md "28.3.48 The INFORMATION_SCHEMA VIEWS Table") table.
9. There must be no tables or stored procedures with individual
   `ENUM` or `SET` column
   elements that exceed 255 characters or 1020 bytes in length.
   Prior to MySQL 8.0, the maximum combined length
   of `ENUM` or `SET` column
   elements was 64K. In MySQL 8.0, the maximum
   character length of an individual `ENUM` or
   `SET` column element is 255 characters, and
   the maximum byte length is 1020 bytes. (The 1020 byte limit
   supports multibyte character sets). Before upgrading to MySQL
   8.0, modify any `ENUM` or
   `SET` column elements that exceed the new
   limits. Failing to do so causes the upgrade to fail with an
   error.
10. Before upgrading to MySQL 8.0.13 or higher, there must be no
    table partitions that reside in shared
    `InnoDB` tablespaces, which include the
    system tablespace and general tablespaces. Identify table
    partitions in shared tablespaces by querying
    `INFORMATION_SCHEMA`:

    If upgrading from MySQL 5.7, run this query:

    ```sql
    SELECT DISTINCT NAME, SPACE, SPACE_TYPE FROM INFORMATION_SCHEMA.INNODB_SYS_TABLES
      WHERE NAME LIKE '%#P#%' AND SPACE_TYPE NOT LIKE 'Single';
    ```

    If upgrading from an earlier MySQL 8.0 release, run this
    query:

    ```sql
    SELECT DISTINCT NAME, SPACE, SPACE_TYPE FROM INFORMATION_SCHEMA.INNODB_TABLES
      WHERE NAME LIKE '%#P#%' AND SPACE_TYPE NOT LIKE 'Single';
    ```

    Move table partitions from shared tablespaces to
    file-per-table tablespaces using
    [`ALTER TABLE ...
    REORGANIZE PARTITION`](alter-table.md "15.1.9 ALTER TABLE Statement"):

    ```sql
    ALTER TABLE table_name REORGANIZE PARTITION partition_name
      INTO (partition_definition TABLESPACE=innodb_file_per_table);
    ```
11. There must be no queries and stored program definitions from
    MySQL 8.0.12 or lower that use `ASC` or
    `DESC` qualifiers for `GROUP
    BY` clauses. Otherwise, upgrading to MySQL 8.0.13 or
    higher may fail, as may replicating to MySQL 8.0.13 or higher
    replica servers. For additional details, see
    [SQL Changes](upgrading-from-previous-series.md#upgrade-sql-changes "SQL Changes").
12. Your MySQL 5.7 installation must not use
    features that are not supported by MySQL 8.0. Any
    changes here are necessarily installation specific, but the
    following example illustrates the kind of thing to look for:

    Some server startup options and system variables have been
    removed in MySQL 8.0. See
    [Features Removed in MySQL 8.0](mysql-nutshell.md#mysql-nutshell-removals "Features Removed in MySQL 8.0"), and
    [Section 1.4, “Server and Status Variables and Options Added, Deprecated, or Removed in
    MySQL 8.0”](added-deprecated-removed.md "1.4 Server and Status Variables and Options Added, Deprecated, or Removed in MySQL 8.0"). If you use any of
    these, an upgrade requires configuration changes.

    Example: Because the data dictionary provides information
    about database objects, the server no longer checks directory
    names in the data directory to find databases. Consequently,
    the `--ignore-db-dir` option is extraneous and
    has been removed. To handle this, remove any instances of
    `--ignore-db-dir` from your startup
    configuration. In addition, remove or move the named data
    directory subdirectories before upgrading to MySQL
    8.0. (Alternatively, let the 8.0
    server add those directories to the data dictionary as
    databases, then remove each of those databases using
    [`DROP DATABASE`](drop-database.md "15.1.24 DROP DATABASE Statement").)
13. If you intend to change the
    [`lower_case_table_names`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_lower_case_table_names)
    setting to 1 at upgrade time, ensure that schema and table
    names are lowercase before upgrading. Otherwise, a failure
    could occur due to a schema or table name lettercase mismatch.
    You can use the following queries to check for schema and
    table names containing uppercase characters:

    ```sql
    mysql> select TABLE_NAME, if(sha(TABLE_NAME) !=sha(lower(TABLE_NAME)),'Yes','No') as UpperCase from information_schema.tables;
    ```

    As of MySQL 8.0.19, if
    [`lower_case_table_names=1`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_lower_case_table_names),
    table and schema names are checked by the upgrade process to
    ensure that all characters are lowercase. If table or schema
    names are found to contain uppercase characters, the upgrade
    process fails with an error.

    Note

    Changing the
    [`lower_case_table_names`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_lower_case_table_names)
    setting at upgrade time is not recommended.

If upgrade to MySQL 8.0 fails due to any of the
issues outlined above, the server reverts all changes to the data
directory. In this case, remove all redo log files and restart the
MySQL 5.7 server on the existing data directory to
address the errors. The redo log files
(`ib_logfile*`) reside in the MySQL data
directory by default. After the errors are fixed, perform a slow
shutdown (by setting
[`innodb_fast_shutdown=0`](innodb-parameters.md#sysvar_innodb_fast_shutdown)) before
attempting the upgrade again.
