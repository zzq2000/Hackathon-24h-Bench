#### 20.5.3.1 Understanding Transaction Consistency Guarantees

In terms of distributed consistency guarantees, either in normal
or failure repair operations, Group Replication has always been
an eventual consistency system. This means that as soon as the
incoming traffic slows down or stops, all group members have the
same data content. The events that relate to the consistency of
a system can be split into control operations, either manual or
automatically triggered by failures; and data flow operations.

For Group Replication, the control operations that can be
evaluated in terms of consistency are:

- a member joining or leaving, which is covered by Group
  Replication's
  [Section 20.5.4, “Distributed Recovery”](group-replication-distributed-recovery.md "20.5.4 Distributed Recovery") and
  write protection.
- network failures, which are covered by the fencing modes.
- in single-primary groups, primary failover, which can also
  be an operation triggered by
  [`group_replication_set_as_primary()`](group-replication-functions-for-new-primary.md#function_group-replication-set-as-primary).

##### Consistency Guarantees and Primary Failover

In a single-primary group, in the event of a primary failover
when a secondary is promoted to primary, the new primary can
either be made available to application traffic immediately,
regardless of how large the replication backlog is, or
alternatively access to it can be restricted until the backlog
has been applied.

With the first approach, the group takes the minimum time
possible to secure a stable group membership after a primary
failure by electing a new primary and then allowing data
access immediately while it is still applying any possible
backlog from the old primary. Write consistency is ensured,
but reads can temporarily retrieve stale data while the new
primary applies the backlog. For example, if client C1 wrote
`A=2 WHERE A=1` on the old primary just
before its failure, when client C1 is reconnected to the new
primary it could potentially read `A=1` until
the new primary applies its backlog and catches up with the
state of the old primary before it left the group.

With the second alternative, the system secures a stable group
membership after the primary failure and elects a new primary
in the same way as the first alternative, but in this case the
group then waits until the new primary applies all backlog and
only then does it permit data access. This ensures that in a
situation as described previously, when client C1 is
reconnected to the new primary it reads
`A=2`. However, the trade-off is that the
time required to failover is then proportional to the size of
the backlog, which on a correctly configured group should be
small
.

Prior to MySQL 8.0.14 there was no way to set the failover
policy; by default, availability was maximized as described in
the first approach. In a group with members running MySQL
8.0.14 and higher, you can determine the level of transaction
consistency guarantees provided by members during primary
failover using the
[`group_replication_consistency`](group-replication-system-variables.md#sysvar_group_replication_consistency)
variable. See
[Impact of Consistency on Primary Election](group-replication-configuring-consistency-guarantees.md#group-replication-consistency-level-impact-election "Impact of Consistency on Primary Election").

##### Data Flow Operations

Data flow is relevant to group consistency guarantees due to
the reads and writes executed against a group, especially when
these operations are distributed across all members. Data flow
operations apply to both modes of Group Replication:
single-primary and multi-primary, however to make this
explanation clearer it is restricted to single-primary mode.
The usual way to split incoming read or write transactions
across a single-primary group's members is to route writes to
the primary and evenly distribute reads to the secondaries.
Since the group should behave as a single entity, it is
reasonable to expect that writes on the primary are
instantaneously available on the secondaries. Although Group
Replication is written using Group Communication System (GCS)
protocols that implement the Paxos algorithm, some parts of
Group Replication are asynchronous, which implies that data is
asynchronously applied to secondaries. This means that a
client C2 can write `B=2 WHERE B=1` on the
primary, immediately connect to a secondary and read
`B=1`. This is because the secondary is still
applying backlog, and has not applied the transaction which
was applied by the primary.

##### Transaction Synchronization Points

You configure a group's consistency guarantee based on the
point at which you want to synchronize transactions across the
group. To help you understand the concept, this section
simplifies the points of synchronizing transactions across a
group to be at the time of a read operation or at the time of
a write operation. If data is synchronized at the time of a
read, the current client session waits until a given
point, which is the point in time that all preceding update
transactions have been applied, before it can start executing.
With this approach, only this session is affected, all other
concurrent data operations are not affected.

If data is synchronized at the time of write, the writing
session waits until all secondaries have written their data.
Group Replication uses a total order on writes, and therefore
this implies waiting for this and all preceding writes that
are in secondaries’ queues to be applied. Therefore when
using this synchronization point, the writing session waits
for all secondaries queues to be applied.

Any alternative ensures that in the situation described for
client C2 would always read `B=2` even if
immediately connected to a secondary. Each alternative has its
advantages and disadvantages, which are directly related to
your system workload. The following examples describe
different types of workloads and advise which point of
synchronization is appropriate.

Imagine the following situations:

- You want to load-balance reads without deploying
  additional restrictions on which server you read from to
  avoid reading stale data, group writes are much less
  common than group reads.
- For a group that has predominantly read-only data, you
  want read/write transactions to be applied everywhere once
  they commit, so that subsequent reads are done on
  up-to-date data that includes the latest write. This
  ensures that you do not pay the synchronization cost for
  every read-only transaction, but only for read/write
  transactions.

In these cases, you should choose to synchronize on writes.

Imagine the following situations:

- You want to load balance your reads without deploying
  additional restrictions on which server you read from to
  avoid reading stale data, group writes are much more
  common than group reads.
- You want specific transactions in your workload to always
  read up-to-date data from the group, for example whenever
  sensitive data is updated (such as credentials for a file
  or similar data) and you want to enforce that reads
  retrieve the most up to date value.

In these cases, you should choose to synchronize on reads.
