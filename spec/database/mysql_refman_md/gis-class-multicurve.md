#### 13.4.2.10 MultiCurve Class

A `MultiCurve` is a geometry collection
composed of `Curve` elements.
`MultiCurve` is a noninstantiable class.

**`MultiCurve`
Properties**

- A `MultiCurve` is a one-dimensional
  geometry.
- A `MultiCurve` is simple if and only if
  all of its elements are simple; the only intersections
  between any two elements occur at points that are on the
  boundaries of both elements.
- A `MultiCurve` boundary is obtained by
  applying the “mod 2 union rule” (also known
  as the “odd-even rule”): A point is in the
  boundary of a `MultiCurve` if it is in
  the boundaries of an odd number of
  `Curve` elements.
- A `MultiCurve` is closed if all of its
  elements are closed.
- The boundary of a closed `MultiCurve` is
  always empty.
