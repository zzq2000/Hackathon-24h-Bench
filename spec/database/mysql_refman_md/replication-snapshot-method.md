#### 19.1.2.5 Choosing a Method for Data Snapshots

If the source database contains existing data it is necessary to
copy this data to each replica. There are different ways to dump
the data from the source database. The following sections
describe possible options.

To select the appropriate method of dumping the database, choose
between these options:

- Use the [**mysqldump**](mysqldump.md "6.5.4 mysqldump — A Database Backup Program") tool to create a dump
  of all the databases you want to replicate. This is the
  recommended method, especially when using
  [`InnoDB`](innodb-storage-engine.md "Chapter 17 The InnoDB Storage Engine").
- If your database is stored in binary portable files, you can
  copy the raw data files to a replica. This can be more
  efficient than using [**mysqldump**](mysqldump.md "6.5.4 mysqldump — A Database Backup Program") and
  importing the file on each replica, because it skips the
  overhead of updating indexes as the
  `INSERT` statements are replayed. With
  storage engines such as [`InnoDB`](innodb-storage-engine.md "Chapter 17 The InnoDB Storage Engine")
  this is not recommended.
- Use MySQL Server's clone plugin to transfer all the data
  from an existing replica to a clone. For instructions to use
  this method, see [Section 7.6.7.7, “Cloning for Replication”](clone-plugin-replication.md "7.6.7.7 Cloning for Replication").

Tip

To deploy multiple instances of MySQL, you can use [InnoDB Cluster](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/mysql-shell/8.0/en/mysql-innodb-cluster.html) which enables you to easily administer a group of MySQL server instances in [MySQL Shell](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/mysql-shell/8.0/en/). InnoDB Cluster wraps MySQL Group Replication in a programmatic environment that enables you easily deploy a cluster of MySQL instances to achieve high availability. In addition, InnoDB Cluster interfaces seamlessly with [MySQL Router](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/mysql-router/8.0/en/), which enables your applications to connect to the cluster without writing your own failover process. For similar use cases that do not require high availability, however, you can use [InnoDB ReplicaSet](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/mysql-shell/8.0/en/mysql-innodb-replicaset.html). Installation instructions for MySQL Shell can be found [here](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/mysql-shell/8.0/en/mysql-shell-install.html).

##### 19.1.2.5.1 Creating a Data Snapshot Using mysqldump

To create a snapshot of the data in an existing source
database, use the [**mysqldump**](mysqldump.md "6.5.4 mysqldump — A Database Backup Program") tool. Once the
data dump has been completed, import this data into the
replica before starting the replication process.

The following example dumps all databases to a file named
`dbdump.db`, and includes the
[`--master-data`](mysqldump.md#option_mysqldump_master-data) option which
automatically appends the [`CHANGE
REPLICATION SOURCE TO`](change-replication-source-to.md "15.4.2.3 CHANGE REPLICATION SOURCE TO Statement") | [`CHANGE
MASTER TO`](change-master-to.md "15.4.2.1 CHANGE MASTER TO Statement") statement required on the replica to start
the replication process:

```terminal
$> mysqldump --all-databases --master-data > dbdump.db
```

Note

If you do not use
[`--master-data`](mysqldump.md#option_mysqldump_master-data), then it is
necessary to lock all tables in a separate session manually.
See [Section 19.1.2.4, “Obtaining the Replication Source Binary Log Coordinates”](replication-howto-masterstatus.md "19.1.2.4 Obtaining the Replication Source Binary Log Coordinates").

It is possible to exclude certain databases from the dump
using the [**mysqldump**](mysqldump.md "6.5.4 mysqldump — A Database Backup Program") tool. If you want to
choose which databases to include in the dump, do not use
[`--all-databases`](mysqldump.md#option_mysqldump_all-databases). Choose one
of these options:

- Exclude all the tables in the database using
  [`--ignore-table`](mysqldump.md#option_mysqldump_ignore-table) option.
- Name only those databases which you want dumped using the
  [`--databases`](mysqldump.md#option_mysqldump_databases) option.

Note

By default, if GTIDs are in use on the source
([`gtid_mode=ON`](replication-options-gtids.md#sysvar_gtid_mode)),
[**mysqldump**](mysqldump.md "6.5.4 mysqldump — A Database Backup Program") includes the GTIDs from the
[`gtid_executed`](replication-options-gtids.md#sysvar_gtid_executed) set on the
source in the dump output to add them to the
[`gtid_purged`](replication-options-gtids.md#sysvar_gtid_purged) set on the
replica. If you are dumping only specific databases or
tables, it is important to note that the value that is
included by [**mysqldump**](mysqldump.md "6.5.4 mysqldump — A Database Backup Program") includes the GTIDs
of all transactions in the
[`gtid_executed`](replication-options-gtids.md#sysvar_gtid_executed) set on the
source, even those that changed suppressed parts of the
database, or other databases on the server that were not
included in the partial dump. Check the description for
mysqldump's `--set-gtid-purged` option to
find the outcome of the default behavior for the MySQL
Server versions you are using, and how to change the
behavior if this outcome is not suitable for your situation.

For more information, see [Section 6.5.4, “mysqldump — A Database Backup Program”](mysqldump.md "6.5.4 mysqldump — A Database Backup Program").

To import the data, either copy the dump file to the replica,
or access the file from the source when connecting remotely to
the replica.

##### 19.1.2.5.2 Creating a Data Snapshot Using Raw Data Files

This section describes how to create a data snapshot using the
raw files which make up the database.
Employing this method with a table using a storage engine that
has complex caching or logging algorithms requires extra steps
to produce a perfect “point in time” snapshot:
the initial copy command could leave out cache information and
logging updates, even if you have acquired a global read lock.
How the storage engine responds to this depends on its crash
recovery abilities.

If you use [`InnoDB`](innodb-storage-engine.md "Chapter 17 The InnoDB Storage Engine") tables, you can
use the **mysqlbackup** command from the MySQL Enterprise Backup
component to produce a consistent snapshot. This command
records the log name and offset corresponding to the snapshot
to be used on the replica. MySQL Enterprise Backup is a commercial product that
is included as part of a MySQL Enterprise subscription. See
[Section 32.1, “MySQL Enterprise Backup Overview”](mysql-enterprise-backup.md "32.1 MySQL Enterprise Backup Overview") for detailed
information.

This method also does not work reliably if the source and
replica have different values for
[`ft_stopword_file`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_ft_stopword_file),
[`ft_min_word_len`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_ft_min_word_len), or
[`ft_max_word_len`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_ft_max_word_len) and you are
copying tables having full-text indexes.

Assuming the above exceptions do not apply to your database,
use the [cold backup](glossary.md#glos_cold_backup "cold backup")
technique to obtain a reliable binary snapshot of
`InnoDB` tables: do a
[slow shutdown](glossary.md#glos_slow_shutdown "slow shutdown") of the
MySQL Server, then copy the data files manually.

To create a raw data snapshot of
[`MyISAM`](myisam-storage-engine.md "18.2 The MyISAM Storage Engine") tables when your MySQL
data files exist on a single file system, you can use standard
file copy tools such as **cp** or
**copy**, a remote copy tool such as
**scp** or **rsync**, an
archiving tool such as **zip** or
**tar**, or a file system snapshot tool such as
**dump**. If you are replicating only certain
databases, copy only those files that relate to those tables.
For `InnoDB`, all tables in all databases are
stored in the [system
tablespace](glossary.md#glos_system_tablespace "system tablespace") files, unless you have the
[`innodb_file_per_table`](innodb-parameters.md#sysvar_innodb_file_per_table) option
enabled.

The following files are not required for replication:

- Files relating to the `mysql` database.
- The replica's connection metadata repository file
  `master.info`, if used; the use of this
  file is now deprecated (see
  [Section 19.2.4, “Relay Log and Replication Metadata Repositories”](replica-logs.md "19.2.4 Relay Log and Replication Metadata Repositories")).
- The source's binary log files, with the exception of the
  binary log index file if you are going to use this to
  locate the source binary log coordinates for the replica.
- Any relay log files.

Depending on whether you are using `InnoDB`
tables or not, choose one of the following:

If you are using [`InnoDB`](innodb-storage-engine.md "Chapter 17 The InnoDB Storage Engine") tables,
and also to get the most consistent results with a raw data
snapshot, shut down the source server during the process, as
follows:

1. Acquire a read lock and get the source's status. See
   [Section 19.1.2.4, “Obtaining the Replication Source Binary Log Coordinates”](replication-howto-masterstatus.md "19.1.2.4 Obtaining the Replication Source Binary Log Coordinates").
2. In a separate session, shut down the source server:

   ```terminal
   $> mysqladmin shutdown
   ```
3. Make a copy of the MySQL data files. The following
   examples show common ways to do this. You need to choose
   only one of them:

   ```terminal
   $> tar cf /tmp/db.tar ./data
   $> zip -r /tmp/db.zip ./data
   $> rsync --recursive ./data /tmp/dbdata
   ```
4. Restart the source server.

If you are not using [`InnoDB`](innodb-storage-engine.md "Chapter 17 The InnoDB Storage Engine")
tables, you can get a snapshot of the system from a source
without shutting down the server as described in the following
steps:

1. Acquire a read lock and get the source's status. See
   [Section 19.1.2.4, “Obtaining the Replication Source Binary Log Coordinates”](replication-howto-masterstatus.md "19.1.2.4 Obtaining the Replication Source Binary Log Coordinates").
2. Make a copy of the MySQL data files. The following
   examples show common ways to do this. You need to choose
   only one of them:

   ```terminal
   $> tar cf /tmp/db.tar ./data
   $> zip -r /tmp/db.zip ./data
   $> rsync --recursive ./data /tmp/dbdata
   ```
3. In the client where you acquired the read lock, release
   the lock:

   ```sql
   mysql> UNLOCK TABLES;
   ```

Once you have created the archive or copy of the database,
copy the files to each replica before starting the replication
process.
