### 13.1.6 Numeric Type Attributes

MySQL supports an extension for optionally specifying the
display width of integer data types in parentheses following the
base keyword for the type. For example,
[`INT(4)`](integer-types.md "13.1.2 Integer Types (Exact Value) - INTEGER, INT, SMALLINT, TINYINT, MEDIUMINT, BIGINT") specifies an
[`INT`](integer-types.md "13.1.2 Integer Types (Exact Value) - INTEGER, INT, SMALLINT, TINYINT, MEDIUMINT, BIGINT") with a display width of four
digits. This optional display width may be used by applications
to display integer values having a width less than the width
specified for the column by left-padding them with spaces. (That
is, this width is present in the metadata returned with result
sets. Whether it is used is up to the application.)

The display width does *not* constrain the
range of values that can be stored in the column. Nor does it
prevent values wider than the column display width from being
displayed correctly. For example, a column specified as
[`SMALLINT(3)`](integer-types.md "13.1.2 Integer Types (Exact Value) - INTEGER, INT, SMALLINT, TINYINT, MEDIUMINT, BIGINT") has the usual
[`SMALLINT`](integer-types.md "13.1.2 Integer Types (Exact Value) - INTEGER, INT, SMALLINT, TINYINT, MEDIUMINT, BIGINT") range of
`-32768` to `32767`, and
values outside the range permitted by three digits are displayed
in full using more than three digits.

When used in conjunction with the optional (nonstandard)
`ZEROFILL` attribute, the default padding of
spaces is replaced with zeros. For example, for a column
declared as [`INT(4) ZEROFILL`](integer-types.md "13.1.2 Integer Types (Exact Value) - INTEGER, INT, SMALLINT, TINYINT, MEDIUMINT, BIGINT"), a
value of `5` is retrieved as
`0005`.

Note

The `ZEROFILL` attribute is ignored for
columns involved in expressions or
[`UNION`](union.md "15.2.18 UNION Clause") queries.

If you store values larger than the display width in an
integer column that has the `ZEROFILL`
attribute, you may experience problems when MySQL generates
temporary tables for some complicated joins. In these cases,
MySQL assumes that the data values fit within the column
display width.

As of MySQL 8.0.17, the `ZEROFILL` attribute is
deprecated for numeric data types, as is the display width
attribute for integer data types. You should expect support for
`ZEROFILL` and display widths for integer data
types to be removed in a future version of MySQL. Consider using
an alternative means of producing the effect of these
attributes. For example, applications can use the
[`LPAD()`](string-functions.md#function_lpad) function to zero-pad
numbers up to the desired width, or they can store the formatted
numbers in [`CHAR`](char.md "13.3.2 The CHAR and VARCHAR Types") columns.

All integer types can have an optional (nonstandard)
`UNSIGNED` attribute. An unsigned type can be
used to permit only nonnegative numbers in a column or when you
need a larger upper numeric range for the column. For example,
if an [`INT`](integer-types.md "13.1.2 Integer Types (Exact Value) - INTEGER, INT, SMALLINT, TINYINT, MEDIUMINT, BIGINT") column is
`UNSIGNED`, the size of the column's range is
the same but its endpoints shift up, from
`-2147483648` and `2147483647`
to `0` and `4294967295`.

Floating-point and fixed-point types also can be
`UNSIGNED`. As with integer types, this
attribute prevents negative values from being stored in the
column. Unlike the integer types, the upper range of column
values remains the same. As of MySQL 8.0.17, the
`UNSIGNED` attribute is deprecated for columns
of type [`FLOAT`](floating-point-types.md "13.1.4 Floating-Point Types (Approximate Value) - FLOAT, DOUBLE"),
[`DOUBLE`](floating-point-types.md "13.1.4 Floating-Point Types (Approximate Value) - FLOAT, DOUBLE"), and
[`DECIMAL`](fixed-point-types.md "13.1.3 Fixed-Point Types (Exact Value) - DECIMAL, NUMERIC") (and any synonyms) and
you should expect support for it to be removed in a future
version of MySQL. Consider using a simple
`CHECK` constraint instead for such columns.

If you specify `ZEROFILL` for a numeric column,
MySQL automatically adds the `UNSIGNED`
attribute.

Integer or floating-point data types can have the
`AUTO_INCREMENT` attribute. When you insert a
value of `NULL` into an indexed
`AUTO_INCREMENT` column, the column is set to
the next sequence value. Typically this is
`value+1`, where
*`value`* is the largest value for the
column currently in the table.
(`AUTO_INCREMENT` sequences begin with
`1`.)

Storing `0` into an
`AUTO_INCREMENT` column has the same effect as
storing `NULL`, unless the
[`NO_AUTO_VALUE_ON_ZERO`](sql-mode.md#sqlmode_no_auto_value_on_zero) SQL mode
is enabled.

Inserting `NULL` to generate
`AUTO_INCREMENT` values requires that the
column be declared `NOT NULL`. If the column is
declared `NULL`, inserting
`NULL` stores a `NULL`. When
you insert any other value into an
`AUTO_INCREMENT` column, the column is set to
that value and the sequence is reset so that the next
automatically generated value follows sequentially from the
inserted value.

Negative values for `AUTO_INCREMENT` columns
are not supported.

`CHECK` constraints cannot refer to columns
that have the `AUTO_INCREMENT` attribute, nor
can the `AUTO_INCREMENT` attribute be added to
existing columns that are used in `CHECK`
constraints.

As of MySQL 8.0.17, `AUTO_INCREMENT` support is
deprecated for [`FLOAT`](floating-point-types.md "13.1.4 Floating-Point Types (Approximate Value) - FLOAT, DOUBLE") and
[`DOUBLE`](floating-point-types.md "13.1.4 Floating-Point Types (Approximate Value) - FLOAT, DOUBLE") columns; you should expect
it to be removed in a future version of MySQL. Consider removing
the `AUTO_INCREMENT` attribute from such
columns, or convert them to an integer type.
