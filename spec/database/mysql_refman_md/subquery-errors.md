#### 15.2.15.10 Subquery Errors

There are some errors that apply only to subqueries. This
section describes them.

- Unsupported subquery syntax:

  ```none
  ERROR 1235 (ER_NOT_SUPPORTED_YET)
  SQLSTATE = 42000
  Message = "This version of MySQL doesn't yet support
  'LIMIT & IN/ALL/ANY/SOME subquery'"
  ```

  This means that MySQL does not support statements like the
  following:

  ```sql
  SELECT * FROM t1 WHERE s1 IN (SELECT s2 FROM t2 ORDER BY s1 LIMIT 1)
  ```
- Incorrect number of columns from subquery:

  ```none
  ERROR 1241 (ER_OPERAND_COL)
  SQLSTATE = 21000
  Message = "Operand should contain 1 column(s)"
  ```

  This error occurs in cases like this:

  ```sql
  SELECT (SELECT column1, column2 FROM t2) FROM t1;
  ```

  You may use a subquery that returns multiple columns, if the
  purpose is row comparison. In other contexts, the subquery
  must be a scalar operand. See
  [Section 15.2.15.5, “Row Subqueries”](row-subqueries.md "15.2.15.5 Row Subqueries").
- Incorrect number of rows from subquery:

  ```none
  ERROR 1242 (ER_SUBSELECT_NO_1_ROW)
  SQLSTATE = 21000
  Message = "Subquery returns more than 1 row"
  ```

  This error occurs for statements where the subquery must
  return at most one row but returns multiple rows. Consider
  the following example:

  ```sql
  SELECT * FROM t1 WHERE column1 = (SELECT column1 FROM t2);
  ```

  If `SELECT column1 FROM t2` returns just
  one row, the previous query works. If the subquery returns
  more than one row, error 1242 occurs. In that case, the
  query should be rewritten as:

  ```sql
  SELECT * FROM t1 WHERE column1 = ANY (SELECT column1 FROM t2);
  ```
- Incorrectly used table in subquery:

  ```none
  Error 1093 (ER_UPDATE_TABLE_USED)
  SQLSTATE = HY000
  Message = "You can't specify target table 'x'
  for update in FROM clause"
  ```

  This error occurs in cases such as the following, which
  attempts to modify a table and select from the same table in
  the subquery:

  ```sql
  UPDATE t1 SET column2 = (SELECT MAX(column1) FROM t1);
  ```

  You can use a common table expression or derived table to
  work around this. See
  [Section 15.2.15.12, “Restrictions on Subqueries”](subquery-restrictions.md "15.2.15.12 Restrictions on Subqueries").

In MySQL 8.0.19 and later, all of the errors described in this
section also apply when using
[`TABLE`](table.md "15.2.16 TABLE Statement") in subqueries.

For transactional storage engines, the failure of a subquery
causes the entire statement to fail. For nontransactional
storage engines, data modifications made before the error was
encountered are preserved.
