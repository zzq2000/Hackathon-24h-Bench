#### 25.6.8.3 Configuration for NDB Cluster Backups

Five configuration parameters are essential for backup:

- [`BackupDataBufferSize`](mysql-cluster-ndbd-definition.md#ndbparam-ndbd-backupdatabuffersize)

  The amount of memory used to buffer data before it is
  written to disk.
- [`BackupLogBufferSize`](mysql-cluster-ndbd-definition.md#ndbparam-ndbd-backuplogbuffersize)

  The amount of memory used to buffer log records before these
  are written to disk.
- [`BackupMemory`](mysql-cluster-ndbd-definition.md#ndbparam-ndbd-backupmemory)

  The total memory allocated in a data node for backups. This
  should be the sum of the memory allocated for the backup
  data buffer and the backup log buffer.
- [`BackupWriteSize`](mysql-cluster-ndbd-definition.md#ndbparam-ndbd-backupwritesize)

  The default size of blocks written to disk. This applies for
  both the backup data buffer and the backup log buffer.
- [`BackupMaxWriteSize`](mysql-cluster-ndbd-definition.md#ndbparam-ndbd-backupmaxwritesize)

  The maximum size of blocks written to disk. This applies for
  both the backup data buffer and the backup log buffer.

In addition,
[`CompressedBackup`](mysql-cluster-ndbd-definition.md#ndbparam-ndbd-compressedbackup) causes
`NDB` to use compression when creating and
writing to backup files.

More detailed information about these parameters can be found in
[Backup
Parameters](mysql-cluster-ndbd-definition.md#mysql-cluster-backup-parameters "Backup parameters").

You can also set a location for the backup files using the
[`BackupDataDir`](mysql-cluster-ndbd-definition.md#ndbparam-ndbd-backupdatadir)
configuration parameter. The default is
[`FileSystemPath`](mysql-cluster-ndbd-definition.md#ndbparam-ndbd-filesystempath)`/BACKUP/BACKUP-backup_id`.

In NDB 8.0.22 and later, you can enforce encryption of backup
files by enabling
[`RequireEncryptedBackup`](mysql-cluster-ndbd-definition.md#ndbparam-ndbd-requireencryptedbackup).
When this parameter is set to 1, backups cannot be created
without specifying `ENCRYPT
PASSWORD=password` as part
of a `START BACKUP` command.
