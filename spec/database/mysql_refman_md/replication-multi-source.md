MySQL multi-source replication enables a replica to receive
transactions from multiple immediate sources in parallel. In a
multi-source replication topology, a replica creates a replication
channel for each source that it should receive transactions from.
For more information on how replication channels function, see
[Section 19.2.2, “Replication Channels”](replication-channels.md "19.2.2 Replication Channels").

You might choose to implement multi-source replication to achieve
goals like these:

- Backing up multiple servers to a single server.
- Merging table shards.
- Consolidating data from multiple servers to a single server.

Multi-source replication does not implement any conflict detection
or resolution when applying transactions, and those tasks are left
to the application if required.

Note

Each channel on a multi-source replica must replicate from a
different source. You cannot set up multiple replication channels
from a single replica to a single source. This is because the
server IDs of replicas must be unique in a replication topology.
The source distinguishes replicas only by their server IDs, not by
the names of the replication channels, so it cannot recognize
different replication channels from the same replica.

A multi-source replica can also be set up as a multi-threaded
replica, by setting the system variable
[`replica_parallel_workers`](replication-options-replica.md#sysvar_replica_parallel_workers) (from
MySQL 8.0.26) or
[`slave_parallel_workers`](replication-options-replica.md#sysvar_slave_parallel_workers) to a value
greater than 0. When you do this on a multi-source replica, each
channel on the replica has the specified number of applier threads,
plus a coordinator thread to manage them. You cannot configure the
number of applier threads for individual channels.

From MySQL 8.0, multi-source replicas can be configured with
replication filters on specific replication channels. Channel
specific replication filters can be used when the same database or
table is present on multiple sources, and you only need the replica
to replicate it from one source. For GTID-based replication, if the
same transaction might arrive from multiple sources (such as in a
diamond topology), you must ensure the filtering setup is the same
on all channels. For more information, see
[Section 19.2.5.4, “Replication Channel Based Filters”](replication-rules-channel-based-filters.md "19.2.5.4 Replication Channel Based Filters").

This section provides tutorials on how to configure sources and
replicas for multi-source replication, how to start, stop and reset
multi-source replicas, and how to monitor multi-source replication.
