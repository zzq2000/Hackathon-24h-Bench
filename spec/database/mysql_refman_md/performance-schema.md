The MySQL Performance Schema is a feature for monitoring MySQL
Server execution at a low level. The Performance Schema has these
characteristics:

- The Performance Schema provides a way to inspect internal
  execution of the server at runtime. It is implemented using the
  [`PERFORMANCE_SCHEMA`](performance-schema.md "Chapter 29 MySQL Performance Schema") storage engine
  and the `performance_schema` database. The
  Performance Schema focuses primarily on performance data. This
  differs from `INFORMATION_SCHEMA`, which serves
  for inspection of metadata.
- The Performance Schema monitors server events. An
  “event” is anything the server does that takes time
  and has been instrumented so that timing information can be
  collected. In general, an event could be a function call, a wait
  for the operating system, a stage of an SQL statement execution
  such as parsing or sorting, or an entire statement or group of
  statements. Event collection provides access to information
  about synchronization calls (such as for mutexes) file and table
  I/O, table locks, and so forth for the server and for several
  storage engines.
- Performance Schema events are distinct from events written to
  the server's binary log (which describe data modifications) and
  Event Scheduler events (which are a type of stored program).
- Performance Schema events are specific to a given instance of
  the MySQL Server. Performance Schema tables are considered local
  to the server, and changes to them are not replicated or written
  to the binary log.
- Current events are available, as well as event histories and
  summaries. This enables you to determine how many times
  instrumented activities were performed and how much time they
  took. Event information is available to show the activities of
  specific threads, or activity associated with particular objects
  such as a mutex or file.
- The [`PERFORMANCE_SCHEMA`](performance-schema.md "Chapter 29 MySQL Performance Schema") storage
  engine collects event data using “instrumentation
  points” in server source code.
- Collected events are stored in tables in the
  `performance_schema` database. These tables can
  be queried using [`SELECT`](select.md "15.2.13 SELECT Statement")
  statements like other tables.
- Performance Schema configuration can be modified dynamically by
  updating tables in the `performance_schema`
  database through SQL statements. Configuration changes affect
  data collection immediately.
- Tables in the Performance Schema are in-memory tables that use
  no persistent on-disk storage. The contents are repopulated
  beginning at server startup and discarded at server shutdown.
- Monitoring is available on all platforms supported by MySQL.

  Some limitations might apply: The types of timers might vary per
  platform. Instruments that apply to storage engines might not be
  implemented for all storage engines. Instrumentation of each
  third-party engine is the responsibility of the engine
  maintainer. See also
  [Section 29.20, “Restrictions on Performance Schema”](performance-schema-restrictions.md "29.20 Restrictions on Performance Schema").
- Data collection is implemented by modifying the server source
  code to add instrumentation. There are no separate threads
  associated with the Performance Schema, unlike other features
  such as replication or the Event Scheduler.

The Performance Schema is intended to provide access to useful
information about server execution while having minimal impact on
server performance. The implementation follows these design goals:

- Activating the Performance Schema causes no changes in server
  behavior. For example, it does not cause thread scheduling to
  change, and it does not cause query execution plans (as shown by
  [`EXPLAIN`](explain.md "15.8.2 EXPLAIN Statement")) to change.
- Server monitoring occurs continuously and unobtrusively with
  very little overhead. Activating the Performance Schema does not
  make the server unusable.
- The parser is unchanged. There are no new keywords or
  statements.
- Execution of server code proceeds normally even if the
  Performance Schema fails internally.
- When there is a choice between performing processing during
  event collection initially or during event retrieval later,
  priority is given to making collection faster. This is because
  collection is ongoing whereas retrieval is on demand and might
  never happen at all.
- Most Performance Schema tables have indexes, which gives the
  optimizer access to execution plans other than full table scans.
  For more information, see
  [Section 10.2.4, “Optimizing Performance Schema Queries”](performance-schema-optimization.md "10.2.4 Optimizing Performance Schema Queries").
- It is easy to add new instrumentation points.
- Instrumentation is versioned. If the instrumentation
  implementation changes, previously instrumented code continues
  to work. This benefits developers of third-party plugins because
  it is not necessary to upgrade each plugin to stay synchronized
  with the latest Performance Schema changes.

Note

The MySQL `sys` schema is a set of objects that
provides convenient access to data collected by the Performance
Schema. The `sys` schema is installed by default.
For usage instructions, see [Chapter 30, *MySQL sys Schema*](sys-schema.md "Chapter 30 MySQL sys Schema").
