### 15.1.27 DROP INDEX Statement

```sql
DROP INDEX index_name ON tbl_name
    [algorithm_option | lock_option] ...

algorithm_option:
    ALGORITHM [=] {DEFAULT | INPLACE | COPY}

lock_option:
    LOCK [=] {DEFAULT | NONE | SHARED | EXCLUSIVE}
```

[`DROP INDEX`](drop-index.md "15.1.27 DROP INDEX Statement") drops the index named
*`index_name`* from the table
*`tbl_name`*. This statement is mapped to
an [`ALTER TABLE`](alter-table.md "15.1.9 ALTER TABLE Statement") statement to drop
the index. See [Section 15.1.9, “ALTER TABLE Statement”](alter-table.md "15.1.9 ALTER TABLE Statement").

To drop a primary key, the index name is always
`PRIMARY`, which must be specified as a quoted
identifier because `PRIMARY` is a reserved word:

```sql
DROP INDEX `PRIMARY` ON t;
```

Indexes on variable-width columns of
[`NDB`](mysql-cluster.md "Chapter 25 MySQL NDB Cluster 8.0") tables are dropped online; that
is, without any table copying. The table is not locked against
access from other NDB Cluster API nodes, although it is locked
against other operations on the *same* API node
for the duration of the operation. This is done automatically by
the server whenever it determines that it is possible to do so;
you do not have to use any special SQL syntax or server options to
cause it to happen.

`ALGORITHM` and `LOCK` clauses
may be given to influence the table copying method and level of
concurrency for reading and writing the table while its indexes
are being modified. They have the same meaning as for the
[`ALTER TABLE`](alter-table.md "15.1.9 ALTER TABLE Statement") statement. For more
information, see [Section 15.1.9, “ALTER TABLE Statement”](alter-table.md "15.1.9 ALTER TABLE Statement")

MySQL NDB Cluster supports online operations using the same
`ALGORITHM=INPLACE` syntax supported in the
standard MySQL Server. See
[Section 25.6.12, “Online Operations with ALTER TABLE in NDB Cluster”](mysql-cluster-online-operations.md "25.6.12 Online Operations with ALTER TABLE in NDB Cluster"), for more
information.
