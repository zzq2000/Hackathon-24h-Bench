### 20.6.2 Securing Group Communication Connections with Secure Socket Layer (SSL)

Secure sockets can be used for group communication connections
between members of a group.

The Group Replication system variable
[`group_replication_ssl_mode`](group-replication-system-variables.md#sysvar_group_replication_ssl_mode) is
used to activate the use of SSL for group communication
connections and specify the security mode for the connections.
This value should be the same on all group members; if it differs,
some members may not be able to join the group. The default
setting means that SSL is not used. This variable has the
following possible values:

**Table 20.1 group\_replication\_ssl\_mode configuration values**

| Value | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `DISABLED` | Establish an unencrypted connection (the default). |
| `REQUIRED` | Establish a secure connection if the server supports secure connections. |
| `VERIFY_CA` | Like `REQUIRED`, but additionally verify the server TLS certificate against the configured Certificate Authority (CA) certificates. |
| `VERIFY_IDENTITY` | Like `VERIFY_CA`, but additionally verify that the server certificate matches the host to which the connection is attempted. |

If SSL is used, the means for configuring the secure connection
depends on whether the XCom or the MySQL communication stack is
used for group communication (a choice between the two is
available since MySQL 8.0.27).

**When using the XCom communication stack
(`group_replication_communication_stack=XCOM`):**
The remainder of the configuration for Group Replication's group
communication connections is taken from the server's SSL
configuration. For more information on the options for
configuring the server SSL, see
[Command Options for Encrypted Connections](connection-options.md#encrypted-connection-options "Command Options for Encrypted Connections"). The server SSL
options that are applied to Group Replication's group
communication connections are as follows:

**Table 20.2 SSL Options**

| Server Configuration | Description |
| --- | --- |
| [`ssl_key`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_ssl_key) | The path name of the SSL private key file in PEM format. On the client side, this is the client private key. On the server side, this is the server private key. |
| [`ssl_cert`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_ssl_cert) | The path name of the SSL public key certificate file in PEM format. On the client side, this is the client public key certificate. On the server side, this is the server public key certificate. |
| [`ssl_ca`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_ssl_ca) | The path name of the Certificate Authority (CA) certificate file in PEM format. |
| [`ssl_capath`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_ssl_capath) | The path name of the directory that contains trusted SSL certificate authority (CA) certificate files in PEM format. |
| [`ssl_crl`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_ssl_crl) | The path name of the file containing certificate revocation lists in PEM format. |
| [`ssl_crlpath`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_ssl_crlpath) | The path name of the directory that contains certificate revocation list files in PEM format. |
| [`ssl_cipher`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_ssl_cipher) | A list of permissible ciphers for encrypted connections. |
| [`tls_version`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_tls_version) | A list of the TLS protocols the server permits for encrypted connections. |
| [`tls_ciphersuites`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_tls_ciphersuites) | Which TLSv1.3 ciphersuites the server permits for encrypted connections. |

Important

- Support for the TLSv1 and TLSv1.1 connection protocols is
  removed from MySQL Server as of MySQL 8.0.28. The protocols
  were deprecated from MySQL 8.0.26, though MySQL Server
  clients, including Group Replication server instances acting
  as a client, do not return warnings to the user if a
  deprecated TLS protocol version is used. See
  [Removal of Support for the TLSv1 and TLSv1.1 Protocols](encrypted-connection-protocols-ciphers.md#encrypted-connection-deprecated-protocols "Removal of Support for the TLSv1 and TLSv1.1 Protocols")
  for more information.
- Support for the TLSv1.3 protocol is available in MySQL
  Server as of MySQL 8.0.16, provided that MySQL Server was
  compiled using OpenSSL 1.1.1. The server checks the version
  of OpenSSL at startup, and if it is lower than 1.1.1,
  TLSv1.3 is removed from the default value for the server
  system variables relating to TLS versions (including the
  [`group_replication_recovery_tls_version`](group-replication-system-variables.md#sysvar_group_replication_recovery_tls_version)
  system variable).
- Group Replication supports TLSv1.3 from MySQL 8.0.18. In
  MySQL 8.0.16 and MySQL 8.0.17, if the server supports
  TLSv1.3, the protocol is not supported in the group
  communication engine and cannot be used by Group
  Replication.
- In MySQL 8.0.18, TLSv1.3 can be used in Group Replication
  for the distributed recovery connection, but the
  [`group_replication_recovery_tls_version`](group-replication-system-variables.md#sysvar_group_replication_recovery_tls_version)
  and
  [`group_replication_recovery_tls_ciphersuites`](group-replication-system-variables.md#sysvar_group_replication_recovery_tls_ciphersuites)
  system variables are not available. The donor servers must
  therefore permit the use of at least one TLSv1.3 ciphersuite
  that is enabled by default, as listed in
  [Section 8.3.2, “Encrypted Connection TLS Protocols and Ciphers”](encrypted-connection-protocols-ciphers.md "8.3.2 Encrypted Connection TLS Protocols and Ciphers").
  From MySQL 8.0.19, you can use the options to configure
  client support for any selection of ciphersuites, including
  only non-default ciphersuites if you want.
- In the list of TLS protocols specified in the
  [`tls_version`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_tls_version) system
  variable, ensure the specified versions are contiguous (for
  example, `TLSv1.2,TLSv1.3`). If there are
  any gaps in the list of protocols (for example, if you
  specified `TLSv1,TLSv1.2`, omitting TLS
  1.1) Group Replication might be unable to make group
  communication connections.

In a replication group, OpenSSL negotiates the use of the highest
TLS protocol that is supported by all members. A joining member
that is configured to use only TLSv1.3
([`tls_version=TLSv1.3`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_tls_version)) cannot join
a replication group where any existing member does not support
TLSv1.3, because the group members in that case are using a lower
TLS protocol version. To join the member to the group, you must
configure the joining member to also permit the use of lower TLS
protocol versions supported by the existing group members.
Conversely, if a joining member does not support TLSv1.3, but the
existing group members all do and are using that version for
connections to each other, the member can join if the existing
group members already permit the use of a suitable lower TLS
protocol version, or if you configure them to do so. In that
situation, OpenSSL uses a lower TLS protocol version for the
connections from each member to the joining member. Each member's
connections to other existing members continue to use the highest
available protocol that both members support.

From MySQL 8.0.16, you can change the
[`tls_version`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_tls_version) system variable at
runtime to alter the list of permitted TLS protocol versions for
the server. Note that for Group Replication, the
[`ALTER INSTANCE RELOAD TLS`](alter-instance.md#alter-instance-reload-tls)
statement, which reconfigures the server's TLS context from the
current values of the system variables that define the context,
does not change the TLS context for Group Replication's group
communication connection while Group Replication is running. To
apply the reconfiguration to these connections, you must execute
[`STOP GROUP_REPLICATION`](stop-group-replication.md "15.4.3.2 STOP GROUP_REPLICATION Statement") followed by
[`START GROUP_REPLICATION`](start-group-replication.md "15.4.3.1 START GROUP_REPLICATION Statement") to restart
Group Replication on the member or members where you changed the
[`tls_version`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_tls_version) system variable.
Similarly, if you want to make all members of a group change to
using a higher or lower TLS protocol version, you must carry out a
rolling restart of Group Replication on the members after changing
the list of permitted TLS protocol versions, so that OpenSSL
negotiates the use of the higher TLS protocol version when the
rolling restart is completed. For instructions to change the list
of permitted TLS protocol versions at runtime, see
[Section 8.3.2, “Encrypted Connection TLS Protocols and Ciphers”](encrypted-connection-protocols-ciphers.md "8.3.2 Encrypted Connection TLS Protocols and Ciphers") and
[Server-Side Runtime Configuration and Monitoring for Encrypted
Connections](using-encrypted-connections.md#using-encrypted-connections-server-side-runtime-configuration "Server-Side Runtime Configuration and Monitoring for Encrypted Connections").

The following example shows a section from a
`my.cnf` file that configures SSL on a server,
and activates SSL for Group Replication group communication
connections:

```ini
[mysqld]
ssl_ca = "cacert.pem"
ssl_capath = "/.../ca_directory"
ssl_cert = "server-cert.pem"
ssl_cipher = "DHE-RSA-AEs256-SHA"
ssl_crl = "crl-server-revoked.crl"
ssl_crlpath = "/.../crl_directory"
ssl_key = "server-key.pem"
group_replication_ssl_mode= REQUIRED
```

Important

The [`ALTER INSTANCE RELOAD TLS`](alter-instance.md#alter-instance-reload-tls)
statement, which reconfigures the server's TLS context from the
current values of the system variables that define the context,
does not change the TLS context for Group Replication's group
communication connections while Group Replication is running. To
apply the reconfiguration to these connections, you must execute
[`STOP GROUP_REPLICATION`](stop-group-replication.md "15.4.3.2 STOP GROUP_REPLICATION Statement") followed
by [`START GROUP_REPLICATION`](start-group-replication.md "15.4.3.1 START GROUP_REPLICATION Statement") to
restart Group Replication.

Connections made between a joining member and an existing member
for distributed recovery are not covered by the options described
above. These connections use Group Replication's dedicated
distributed recovery SSL options, which are described in
[Section 20.6.3.2, “Secure Socket Layer (SSL) Connections for Distributed Recovery”](group-replication-configuring-ssl-for-recovery.md "20.6.3.2 Secure Socket Layer (SSL) Connections for Distributed Recovery").

**When using the MySQL communication stack
(group\_replication\_communication\_stack=MYSQL):**
The security settings for distributed recovery of the group are
applied to the normal communications between group members. See
[Section 20.6.3, “Securing Distributed Recovery Connections”](group-replication-distributed-recovery-securing.md "20.6.3 Securing Distributed Recovery Connections")
on how to configure the security settings.
