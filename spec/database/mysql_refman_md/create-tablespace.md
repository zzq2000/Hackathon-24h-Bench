### 15.1.21 CREATE TABLESPACE Statement

```sql
CREATE [UNDO] TABLESPACE tablespace_name

  InnoDB and NDB:
    [ADD DATAFILE 'file_name']
    [AUTOEXTEND_SIZE [=] value]

  InnoDB only:
    [FILE_BLOCK_SIZE = value]
    [ENCRYPTION [=] {'Y' | 'N'}]

  NDB only:
    USE LOGFILE GROUP logfile_group
    [EXTENT_SIZE [=] extent_size]
    [INITIAL_SIZE [=] initial_size]
    [MAX_SIZE [=] max_size]
    [NODEGROUP [=] nodegroup_id]
    [WAIT]
    [COMMENT [=] 'string']

  InnoDB and NDB:
    [ENGINE [=] engine_name]

  Reserved for future use:
    [ENGINE_ATTRIBUTE [=] 'string']
```

This statement is used to create a tablespace. The precise syntax
and semantics depend on the storage engine used. In standard MySQL
releases, this is always an [`InnoDB`](innodb-storage-engine.md "Chapter 17 The InnoDB Storage Engine")
tablespace. MySQL NDB Cluster also supports tablespaces using the
[`NDB`](mysql-cluster.md "Chapter 25 MySQL NDB Cluster 8.0") storage engine.

#### Considerations for InnoDB

[`CREATE TABLESPACE`](create-tablespace.md "15.1.21 CREATE TABLESPACE Statement") syntax is used to
create general tablespaces or undo tablespaces. The
`UNDO` keyword, introduced in MySQL 8.0.14, must
be specified to create an undo tablespace.

A general tablespace is a shared tablespace. It can hold multiple
tables, and supports all table row formats. General tablespaces
can be created in a location relative to or independent of the
data directory.

After creating an `InnoDB` general tablespace,
use [`CREATE TABLE
tbl_name ... TABLESPACE [=]
tablespace_name`](create-table.md "15.1.20 CREATE TABLE Statement") or
[`ALTER TABLE
tbl_name TABLESPACE [=]
tablespace_name`](alter-table.md "15.1.9 ALTER TABLE Statement") to add tables
to the tablespace. For more information, see
[Section 17.6.3.3, “General Tablespaces”](general-tablespaces.md "17.6.3.3 General Tablespaces").

Undo tablespaces contain undo logs. Undo tablespaces can be
created in a chosen location by specifying a fully qualified data
file path. For more information, see
[Section 17.6.3.4, “Undo Tablespaces”](innodb-undo-tablespaces.md "17.6.3.4 Undo Tablespaces").

#### Considerations for NDB Cluster

This statement is used to create a tablespace, which can contain
one or more data files, providing storage space for NDB Cluster
Disk Data tables (see [Section 25.6.11, “NDB Cluster Disk Data Tables”](mysql-cluster-disk-data.md "25.6.11 NDB Cluster Disk Data Tables")).
One data file is created and added to the tablespace using this
statement. Additional data files may be added to the tablespace by
using the [`ALTER TABLESPACE`](alter-tablespace.md "15.1.10 ALTER TABLESPACE Statement")
statement (see [Section 15.1.10, “ALTER TABLESPACE Statement”](alter-tablespace.md "15.1.10 ALTER TABLESPACE Statement")).

Note

All NDB Cluster Disk Data objects share the same namespace. This
means that *each Disk Data object* must be
uniquely named (and not merely each Disk Data object of a given
type). For example, you cannot have a tablespace and a log file
group with the same name, or a tablespace and a data file with
the same name.

A log file group of one or more `UNDO` log files
must be assigned to the tablespace to be created with the
`USE LOGFILE GROUP` clause.
*`logfile_group`* must be an existing log
file group created with [`CREATE LOGFILE
GROUP`](create-logfile-group.md "15.1.16 CREATE LOGFILE GROUP Statement") (see [Section 15.1.16, “CREATE LOGFILE GROUP Statement”](create-logfile-group.md "15.1.16 CREATE LOGFILE GROUP Statement")).
Multiple tablespaces may use the same log file group for
`UNDO` logging.

When setting `EXTENT_SIZE` or
`INITIAL_SIZE`, you may optionally follow the
number with a one-letter abbreviation for an order of magnitude,
similar to those used in `my.cnf`. Generally,
this is one of the letters `M` (for megabytes) or
`G` (for gigabytes).

`INITIAL_SIZE` and `EXTENT_SIZE`
are subject to rounding as follows:

- `EXTENT_SIZE` is rounded up to the nearest
  whole multiple of 32K.
- `INITIAL_SIZE` is rounded
  *down* to the nearest whole multiple of
  32K; this result is rounded up to the nearest whole multiple
  of `EXTENT_SIZE` (after any rounding).

Note

[`NDB`](mysql-cluster.md "Chapter 25 MySQL NDB Cluster 8.0") reserves 4% of a tablespace for
data node restart operations. This reserved space cannot be used
for data storage.

The rounding just described is done explicitly, and a warning is
issued by the MySQL Server when any such rounding is performed.
The rounded values are also used by the NDB kernel for calculating
[`INFORMATION_SCHEMA.FILES`](information-schema-files-table.md "28.3.15 The INFORMATION_SCHEMA FILES Table") column
values and other purposes. However, to avoid an unexpected result,
we suggest that you always use whole multiples of 32K in
specifying these options.

When [`CREATE TABLESPACE`](create-tablespace.md "15.1.21 CREATE TABLESPACE Statement") is used with
`ENGINE [=] NDB`, a tablespace and associated
data file are created on each Cluster data node. You can verify
that the data files were created and obtain information about them
by querying the Information Schema
[`FILES`](information-schema-files-table.md "28.3.15 The INFORMATION_SCHEMA FILES Table") table. (See the example later
in this section.)

(See [Section 28.3.15, “The INFORMATION\_SCHEMA FILES Table”](information-schema-files-table.md "28.3.15 The INFORMATION_SCHEMA FILES Table").)

#### Options

- `ADD DATAFILE`: Defines the name of a
  tablespace data file. This option is always required when
  creating an `NDB` tablespace; for
  `InnoDB` in MySQL 8.0.14 and later, it is
  required only when creating an undo tablespace. The
  `file_name`,
  including any specified path, must be quoted with single or
  double quotation marks. File names (not counting the file
  extension) and directory names must be at least one byte in
  length. Zero length file names and directory names are not
  supported.

  Because there are considerable differences in how
  `InnoDB` and `NDB` treat
  data files, the two storage engines are covered separately in
  the discussion that follows.

  **InnoDB data files.**
  An `InnoDB` tablespace supports only a
  single data file, whose name must include a
  `.ibd` extension.

  To place an `InnoDB` general tablespace data
  file in a location outside of the data directory, include a
  fully qualified path or a path relative to the data directory.
  Only a fully qualified path is permitted for undo tablespaces.
  If you do not specify a path, a general tablespace is created
  in the data directory. An undo tablespace created without
  specifying a path is created in the directory defined by the
  [`innodb_undo_directory`](innodb-parameters.md#sysvar_innodb_undo_directory)
  variable. If the
  [`innodb_undo_directory`](innodb-parameters.md#sysvar_innodb_undo_directory)
  variable is undefined, undo tablespaces are created in the
  data directory.

  To avoid conflicts with implicitly created file-per-table
  tablespaces, creating an `InnoDB` general
  tablespace in a subdirectory under the data directory is not
  supported. When creating a general tablespace or undo
  tablespace outside of the data directory, the directory must
  exist and must be known to `InnoDB` prior to
  creating the tablespace. To make a directory known to
  `InnoDB`, add it to the
  [`innodb_directories`](innodb-parameters.md#sysvar_innodb_directories) value or
  to one of the variables whose values are appended to the
  [`innodb_directories`](innodb-parameters.md#sysvar_innodb_directories) value.
  [`innodb_directories`](innodb-parameters.md#sysvar_innodb_directories) is a
  read-only variable. Configuring it requires restarting the
  server.

  If the `ADD DATAFILE` clause is not specified
  when creating an `InnoDB` tablespace, a
  tablespace data file with a unique file name is created
  implicitly. The unique file name is a 128 bit UUID formatted
  into five groups of hexadecimal numbers separated by dashes
  (*`aaaaaaaa-bbbb-cccc-dddd-eeeeeeeeeeee`*).
  A file extension is added if required by the storage engine.
  An `.ibd` file extension is added for
  `InnoDB` general tablespace data files. In a
  replication environment, the data file name created on the
  replication source server is not the same as the data file
  name created on the replica.

  As of MySQL 8.0.17, the `ADD DATAFILE` clause
  does not permit circular directory references when creating an
  `InnoDB` tablespace. For example, the
  circular directory reference (`/../`) in the
  following statement is not permitted:

  ```sql
  CREATE TABLESPACE ts1 ADD DATAFILE ts1.ibd 'any_directory/../ts1.ibd';
  ```

  An exception to this restriction exists on Linux, where a
  circular directory reference is permitted if the preceding
  directory is a symbolic link. For example, the data file path
  in the example above is permitted if
  *`any_directory`* is a symbolic link.
  (It is still permitted for data file paths to begin with
  '`../`'.)

  **NDB data files.**
  An `NDB` tablespace supports multiple data
  files which can have any legal file names; more data files
  can be added to an NDB Cluster tablespace following its
  creation by using an [`ALTER
  TABLESPACE`](alter-tablespace.md "15.1.10 ALTER TABLESPACE Statement") statement.

  An `NDB` tablespace data file is created by
  default in the data node file system directory—that is,
  the directory named
  `ndb_nodeid_fs/TS`
  under the data node's data directory
  ([`DataDir`](mysql-cluster-ndbd-definition.md#ndbparam-ndbd-datadir)), where
  *`nodeid`* is the data node's
  [`NodeId`](mysql-cluster-ndbd-definition.md#ndbparam-ndbd-nodeid). To place the
  data file in a location other than the default, include an
  absolute directory path or a path relative to the default
  location. If the directory specified does not exist,
  `NDB` attempts to create it; the system user
  account under which the data node process is running must have
  the appropriate permissions to do so.

  Note

  When determining the path used for a data file,
  `NDB` does not expand the
  `~` (tilde) character.

  When multiple data nodes are run on the same physical host,
  the following considerations apply:

  - You cannot specify an absolute path when creating a data
    file.
  - It is not possible to create tablespace data files outside
    the data node file system directory, unless each data node
    has a separate data directory.
  - If each data node has its own data directory, data files
    can be created anywhere within this directory.
  - If each data node has its own data directory, it may also
    be possible to create a data file outside the node's
    data directory using a relative path, as long as this path
    resolves to a unique location on the host file system for
    each data node running on that host.
- `FILE_BLOCK_SIZE`: This option—which is
  specific to `InnoDB` general tablespaces, and
  is ignored by `NDB`—defines the block
  size for the tablespace data file. Values can be specified in
  bytes or kilobytes. For example, an 8 kilobyte file block size
  can be specified as 8192 or 8K. If you do not specify this
  option, `FILE_BLOCK_SIZE` defaults to the
  [`innodb_page_size`](innodb-parameters.md#sysvar_innodb_page_size) value.
  `FILE_BLOCK_SIZE` is required when you intend
  to use the tablespace for storing compressed
  `InnoDB` tables
  (`ROW_FORMAT=COMPRESSED`). In this case, you
  must define the tablespace `FILE_BLOCK_SIZE`
  when creating the tablespace.

  If `FILE_BLOCK_SIZE` is equal the
  [`innodb_page_size`](innodb-parameters.md#sysvar_innodb_page_size) value, the
  tablespace can contain only tables having an uncompressed row
  format (`COMPACT`,
  `REDUNDANT`, and `DYNAMIC`).
  Tables with a `COMPRESSED` row format have a
  different physical page size than uncompressed tables.
  Therefore, compressed tables cannot coexist in the same
  tablespace as uncompressed tables.

  For a general tablespace to contain compressed tables,
  `FILE_BLOCK_SIZE` must be specified, and the
  `FILE_BLOCK_SIZE` value must be a valid
  compressed page size in relation to the
  [`innodb_page_size`](innodb-parameters.md#sysvar_innodb_page_size) value. Also,
  the physical page size of the compressed table
  (`KEY_BLOCK_SIZE`) must be equal to
  `FILE_BLOCK_SIZE/1024`. For example, if
  [`innodb_page_size=16K`](innodb-parameters.md#sysvar_innodb_page_size), and
  `FILE_BLOCK_SIZE=8K`, the
  `KEY_BLOCK_SIZE` of the table must be 8. For
  more information, see [Section 17.6.3.3, “General Tablespaces”](general-tablespaces.md "17.6.3.3 General Tablespaces").
- `USE LOGFILE GROUP`: Required for
  `NDB`, this is the name of a log file group
  previously created using [`CREATE LOGFILE
  GROUP`](create-logfile-group.md "15.1.16 CREATE LOGFILE GROUP Statement"). Not supported for `InnoDB`,
  where it fails with an error.
- `EXTENT_SIZE`: This option is specific to
  NDB, and is not supported by InnoDB, where it fails with an
  error. `EXTENT_SIZE` sets the size, in bytes,
  of the extents used by any files belonging to the tablespace.
  The default value is 1M. The minimum size is 32K, and
  theoretical maximum is 2G, although the practical maximum size
  depends on a number of factors. In most cases, changing the
  extent size does not have any measurable effect on
  performance, and the default value is recommended for all but
  the most unusual situations.

  An extent is a unit of
  disk space allocation. One extent is filled with as much data
  as that extent can contain before another extent is used. In
  theory, up to 65,535 (64K) extents may used per data file;
  however, the recommended maximum is 32,768 (32K). The
  recommended maximum size for a single data file is
  32G—that is, 32K extents × 1 MB per extent. In
  addition, once an extent is allocated to a given partition, it
  cannot be used to store data from a different partition; an
  extent cannot store data from more than one partition. This
  means, for example that a tablespace having a single datafile
  whose `INITIAL_SIZE` (described in the
  following item) is 256 MB and whose
  `EXTENT_SIZE` is 128M has just two extents,
  and so can be used to store data from at most two different
  disk data table partitions.

  You can see how many extents remain free in a given data file
  by querying the Information Schema
  [`FILES`](information-schema-files-table.md "28.3.15 The INFORMATION_SCHEMA FILES Table") table, and so derive an
  estimate for how much space remains free in the file. For
  further discussion and examples, see
  [Section 28.3.15, “The INFORMATION\_SCHEMA FILES Table”](information-schema-files-table.md "28.3.15 The INFORMATION_SCHEMA FILES Table").
- `INITIAL_SIZE`: This option is specific to
  `NDB`, and is not supported by
  `InnoDB`, where it fails with an error.

  The `INITIAL_SIZE` parameter sets the total
  size in bytes of the data file that was specific using
  `ADD DATATFILE`. Once this file has been
  created, its size cannot be changed; however, you can add more
  data files to the tablespace using
  [`ALTER
  TABLESPACE ... ADD DATAFILE`](alter-tablespace.md "15.1.10 ALTER TABLESPACE Statement").

  `INITIAL_SIZE` is optional; its default value
  is 134217728 (128 MB).

  On 32-bit systems, the maximum supported value for
  `INITIAL_SIZE` is 4294967296 (4 GB).
- `AUTOEXTEND_SIZE`: Ignored by MySQL prior to
  MySQL 8.0.23; From MySQL 8.0.23, defines the amount by which
  `InnoDB` extends the size of the tablespace
  when it becomes full. The setting must be a multiple of 4MB.
  The default setting is 0, which causes the tablespace to be
  extended according to the implicit default behavior. For more
  information, see
  [Section 17.6.3.9, “Tablespace AUTOEXTEND\_SIZE Configuration”](innodb-tablespace-autoextend-size.md "17.6.3.9 Tablespace AUTOEXTEND_SIZE Configuration").

  Has no effect in any release of MySQL NDB Cluster 8.0,
  regardless of the storage engine used.
- `MAX_SIZE`: Currently ignored by MySQL;
  reserved for possible future use. Has no effect in any release
  of MySQL 8.0 or MySQL NDB Cluster 8.0, regardless of the
  storage engine used.
- `NODEGROUP`: Currently ignored by MySQL;
  reserved for possible future use. Has no effect in any release
  of MySQL 8.0 or MySQL NDB Cluster 8.0, regardless of the
  storage engine used.
- `WAIT`: Currently ignored by MySQL; reserved
  for possible future use. Has no effect in any release of MySQL
  8.0 or MySQL NDB Cluster 8.0, regardless of the storage engine
  used.
- `COMMENT`: Currently ignored by MySQL;
  reserved for possible future use. Has no effect in any release
  of MySQL 8.0 or MySQL NDB Cluster 8.0, regardless of the
  storage engine used.
- The `ENCRYPTION` clause enables or disables
  page-level data encryption for an `InnoDB`
  general tablespace. Encryption support for general tablespaces
  was introduced in MySQL 8.0.13.

  As of MySQL 8.0.16, if the `ENCRYPTION`
  clause is not specified, the
  [`default_table_encryption`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_default_table_encryption)
  setting controls whether encryption is enabled. The
  `ENCRYPTION` clause overrides the
  [`default_table_encryption`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_default_table_encryption)
  setting. However, if the
  [`table_encryption_privilege_check`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_table_encryption_privilege_check)
  variable is enabled, the
  [`TABLE_ENCRYPTION_ADMIN`](privileges-provided.md#priv_table-encryption-admin)
  privilege is required to use an `ENCRYPTION`
  clause setting that differs from the
  [`default_table_encryption`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_default_table_encryption)
  setting.

  A keyring plugin must be installed and configured before an
  encryption-enabled tablespace can be created.

  When a general tablespace is encrypted, all tables residing in
  the tablespace are encrypted. Likewise, a table created in an
  encrypted tablespace is encrypted.

  For more information, see
  [Section 17.13, “InnoDB Data-at-Rest Encryption”](innodb-data-encryption.md "17.13 InnoDB Data-at-Rest Encryption")
- `ENGINE`: Defines the storage engine which
  uses the tablespace, where
  *`engine_name`* is the name of the
  storage engine. Currently, only the `InnoDB`
  storage engine is supported by standard MySQL 8.0
  releases. MySQL NDB Cluster supports both
  `NDB` and `InnoDB`
  tablespaces. The value of the
  [`default_storage_engine`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_default_storage_engine) system
  variable is used for `ENGINE` if the option
  is not specified.
- The `ENGINE_ATTRIBUTE` option (available as
  of MySQL 8.0.21) is used to specify tablespace attributes for
  primary storage engines. The option is reserved for future
  use.

  Permitted values are a string literal containing a valid
  `JSON` document or an empty string ('').
  Invalid `JSON` is rejected.

  ```sql
  CREATE TABLESPACE ts1 ENGINE_ATTRIBUTE='{"key":"value"}';
  ```

  `ENGINE_ATTRIBUTE` values can be repeated
  without error. In this case, the last specified value is used.

  `ENGINE_ATTRIBUTE` values are not checked by
  the server, nor are they cleared when the table's storage
  engine is changed.

#### Notes

- For the rules covering the naming of MySQL tablespaces, see
  [Section 11.2, “Schema Object Names”](identifiers.md "11.2 Schema Object Names"). In addition to these rules, the
  slash character (“/”) is not permitted, nor can
  you use names beginning with `innodb_`, as
  this prefix is reserved for system use.
- Creation of temporary general tablespaces is not supported.
- General tablespaces do not support temporary tables.
- The `TABLESPACE` option may be used with
  [`CREATE TABLE`](create-table.md "15.1.20 CREATE TABLE Statement") or
  [`ALTER TABLE`](alter-table.md "15.1.9 ALTER TABLE Statement") to assign an
  `InnoDB` table partition or subpartition to a
  file-per-table tablespace. All partitions must belong to the
  same storage engine. Assigning table partitions to shared
  `InnoDB` tablespaces is not supported. Shared
  tablespaces include the `InnoDB` system
  tablespace and general tablespaces.
- General tablespaces support the addition of tables of any row
  format using
  [`CREATE TABLE ...
  TABLESPACE`](create-table.md "15.1.20 CREATE TABLE Statement").
  [`innodb_file_per_table`](innodb-parameters.md#sysvar_innodb_file_per_table) does
  not need to be enabled.
- [`innodb_strict_mode`](innodb-parameters.md#sysvar_innodb_strict_mode) is not
  applicable to general tablespaces. Tablespace management rules
  are strictly enforced independently of
  [`innodb_strict_mode`](innodb-parameters.md#sysvar_innodb_strict_mode). If
  `CREATE TABLESPACE` parameters are incorrect
  or incompatible, the operation fails regardless of the
  [`innodb_strict_mode`](innodb-parameters.md#sysvar_innodb_strict_mode) setting.
  When a table is added to a general tablespace using
  [`CREATE TABLE ...
  TABLESPACE`](create-table.md "15.1.20 CREATE TABLE Statement") or
  [`ALTER TABLE ...
  TABLESPACE`](alter-table.md "15.1.9 ALTER TABLE Statement"),
  [`innodb_strict_mode`](innodb-parameters.md#sysvar_innodb_strict_mode) is ignored
  but the statement is evaluated as if
  [`innodb_strict_mode`](innodb-parameters.md#sysvar_innodb_strict_mode) is
  enabled.
- Use `DROP TABLESPACE` to remove a tablespace.
  All tables must be dropped from a tablespace using
  [`DROP TABLE`](drop-table.md "15.1.32 DROP TABLE Statement") prior to dropping
  the tablespace. Before dropping an NDB Cluster tablespace you
  must also remove all its data files using one or more
  [`ALTER
  TABLESPACE ... DROP DATATFILE`](alter-tablespace.md "15.1.10 ALTER TABLESPACE Statement") statements. See
  [Section 25.6.11.1, “NDB Cluster Disk Data Objects”](mysql-cluster-disk-data-objects.md "25.6.11.1 NDB Cluster Disk Data Objects").
- All parts of an `InnoDB` table added to an
  `InnoDB` general tablespace reside in the
  general tablespace, including indexes and
  [`BLOB`](blob.md "13.3.4 The BLOB and TEXT Types") pages.

  For an `NDB` table assigned to a tablespace,
  only those columns which are not indexed are stored on disk,
  and actually use the tablespace data files. Indexes and
  indexed columns for all `NDB` tables are
  always kept in memory.
- Similar to the system tablespace, truncating or dropping
  tables stored in a general tablespace creates free space
  internally in the general tablespace
  [.ibd data file](glossary.md#glos_ibd_file ".ibd file") which can
  only be used for new `InnoDB` data. Space is
  not released back to the operating system as it is for
  file-per-table tablespaces.
- A general tablespace is not associated with any database or
  schema.
- [`ALTER TABLE ...
  DISCARD TABLESPACE`](alter-table.md "15.1.9 ALTER TABLE Statement") and
  [`ALTER TABLE
  ...IMPORT TABLESPACE`](alter-table.md "15.1.9 ALTER TABLE Statement") are not supported for tables
  that belong to a general tablespace.
- The server uses tablespace-level metadata locking for DDL that
  references general tablespaces. By comparison, the server uses
  table-level metadata locking for DDL that references
  file-per-table tablespaces.
- A generated or existing tablespace cannot be changed to a
  general tablespace.
- There is no conflict between general tablespace names and
  file-per-table tablespace names. The “/”
  character, which is present in file-per-table tablespace
  names, is not permitted in general tablespace names.
- [**mysqldump**](mysqldump.md "6.5.4 mysqldump — A Database Backup Program") and [**mysqlpump**](mysqlpump.md "6.5.6 mysqlpump — A Database Backup Program")
  do not dump `InnoDB`
  [`CREATE TABLESPACE`](create-tablespace.md "15.1.21 CREATE TABLESPACE Statement") statements.

#### InnoDB Examples

This example demonstrates creating a general tablespace and adding
three uncompressed tables of different row formats.

```sql
mysql> CREATE TABLESPACE `ts1` ADD DATAFILE 'ts1.ibd' ENGINE=INNODB;

mysql> CREATE TABLE t1 (c1 INT PRIMARY KEY) TABLESPACE ts1 ROW_FORMAT=REDUNDANT;

mysql> CREATE TABLE t2 (c1 INT PRIMARY KEY) TABLESPACE ts1 ROW_FORMAT=COMPACT;

mysql> CREATE TABLE t3 (c1 INT PRIMARY KEY) TABLESPACE ts1 ROW_FORMAT=DYNAMIC;
```

This example demonstrates creating a general tablespace and adding
a compressed table. The example assumes a default
[`innodb_page_size`](innodb-parameters.md#sysvar_innodb_page_size) value of 16K.
The `FILE_BLOCK_SIZE` of 8192 requires that the
compressed table have a `KEY_BLOCK_SIZE` of 8.

```sql
mysql> CREATE TABLESPACE `ts2` ADD DATAFILE 'ts2.ibd' FILE_BLOCK_SIZE = 8192 Engine=InnoDB;

mysql> CREATE TABLE t4 (c1 INT PRIMARY KEY) TABLESPACE ts2 ROW_FORMAT=COMPRESSED KEY_BLOCK_SIZE=8;
```

This example demonstrates creating a general tablespace without
specifying the `ADD DATAFILE` clause, which is
optional as of MySQL 8.0.14.

```sql
mysql> CREATE TABLESPACE `ts3` ENGINE=INNODB;
```

This example demonstrates creating an undo tablespace.

```sql
mysql> CREATE UNDO TABLESPACE undo_003 ADD DATAFILE 'undo_003.ibu';
```

#### NDB Example

Suppose that you wish to create an NDB Cluster Disk Data
tablespace named `myts` using a datafile named
`mydata-1.dat`. An `NDB`
tablespace always requires the use of a log file group consisting
of one or more undo log files. For this example, we first create a
log file group named `mylg` that contains one
undo long file named `myundo-1.dat`, using the
[`CREATE LOGFILE GROUP`](create-logfile-group.md "15.1.16 CREATE LOGFILE GROUP Statement") statement
shown here:

```sql
mysql> CREATE LOGFILE GROUP myg1
    ->     ADD UNDOFILE 'myundo-1.dat'
    ->     ENGINE=NDB;
Query OK, 0 rows affected (3.29 sec)
```

Now you can create the tablespace previously described using the
following statement:

```sql
mysql> CREATE TABLESPACE myts
    ->     ADD DATAFILE 'mydata-1.dat'
    ->     USE LOGFILE GROUP mylg
    ->     ENGINE=NDB;
Query OK, 0 rows affected (2.98 sec)
```

You can now create a Disk Data table using a
[`CREATE TABLE`](create-table.md "15.1.20 CREATE TABLE Statement") statement with the
`TABLESPACE` and `STORAGE DISK`
options, similar to what is shown here:

```sql
mysql> CREATE TABLE mytable (
    ->     id INT UNSIGNED NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
    ->     lname VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
    ->     fname VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
    ->     dob DATE NOT NULL,
    ->     joined DATE NOT NULL,
    ->     INDEX(last_name, first_name)
    -> )
    ->     TABLESPACE myts STORAGE DISK
    ->     ENGINE=NDB;
Query OK, 0 rows affected (1.41 sec)
```

It is important to note that only the `dob` and
`joined` columns from `mytable`
are actually stored on disk, due to the fact that the
`id`, `lname`, and
`fname` columns are all indexed.

As mentioned previously, when `CREATE TABLESPACE`
is used with `ENGINE [=] NDB`, a tablespace and
associated data file are created on each NDB Cluster data node.
You can verify that the data files were created and obtain
information about them by querying the Information Schema
[`FILES`](information-schema-files-table.md "28.3.15 The INFORMATION_SCHEMA FILES Table") table, as shown here:

```sql
mysql> SELECT FILE_NAME, FILE_TYPE, LOGFILE_GROUP_NAME, STATUS, EXTRA
    ->     FROM INFORMATION_SCHEMA.FILES
    ->     WHERE TABLESPACE_NAME = 'myts';

+--------------+------------+--------------------+--------+----------------+
| file_name    | file_type  | logfile_group_name | status | extra          |
+--------------+------------+--------------------+--------+----------------+
| mydata-1.dat | DATAFILE   | mylg               | NORMAL | CLUSTER_NODE=5 |
| mydata-1.dat | DATAFILE   | mylg               | NORMAL | CLUSTER_NODE=6 |
| NULL         | TABLESPACE | mylg               | NORMAL | NULL           |
+--------------+------------+--------------------+--------+----------------+
3 rows in set (0.01 sec)
```
