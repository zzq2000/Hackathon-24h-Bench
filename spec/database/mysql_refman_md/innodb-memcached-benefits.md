### 17.20.1 Benefits of the InnoDB memcached Plugin

This section outlines advantages the
`daemon_memcached` plugin. The combination of
`InnoDB` tables and **memcached**
offers advantages over using either by themselves.

- Direct access to the `InnoDB` storage engine
  avoids the parsing and planning overhead of SQL.
- Running **memcached** in the same process space
  as the MySQL server avoids the network overhead of passing
  requests back and forth.
- Data written using the **memcached** protocol
  is transparently written to an `InnoDB`
  table, without going through the MySQL SQL layer. You can
  control frequency of writes to achieve higher raw performance
  when updating non-critical data.
- Data requested through the **memcached**
  protocol is transparently queried from an
  `InnoDB` table, without going through the
  MySQL SQL layer.
- Subsequent requests for the same data is served from the
  `InnoDB` buffer pool. The buffer pool handles
  the in-memory caching. You can tune performance of
  data-intensive operations using `InnoDB`
  configuration options.
- Data can be unstructured or structured, depending on the type
  of application. You can create a new table for data, or use
  existing tables.
- `InnoDB` can handle composing and decomposing
  multiple column values into a single
  **memcached** item value, reducing the amount
  of string parsing and concatenation required in your
  application. For example, you can store the string value
  `2|4|6|8` in the **memcached**
  cache, and have `InnoDB` split the value
  based on a separator character, then store the result in four
  numeric columns.
- The transfer between memory and disk is handled automatically,
  simplifying application logic.
- Data is stored in a MySQL database to protect against crashes,
  outages, and corruption.
- You can access the underlying `InnoDB` table
  through SQL for reporting, analysis, ad hoc queries, bulk
  loading, multi-step transactional computations, set operations
  such as union and intersection, and other operations suited to
  the expressiveness and flexibility of SQL.
- You can ensure high availability by using the
  `daemon_memcached` plugin on a source server
  in combination with MySQL replication.

- The integration of **memcached** with MySQL
  provides a way to make in-memory data persistent, so you can
  use it for more significant kinds of data. You can use more
  `add`, `incr`, and similar
  write operations in your application without concern that data
  could be lost. You can stop and start the
  **memcached** server without losing updates
  made to cached data. To guard against unexpected outages, you
  can take advantage of `InnoDB` crash
  recovery, replication, and backup capabilities.
- The way `InnoDB` does fast
  [primary key](glossary.md#glos_primary_key "primary key") lookups is
  a natural fit for **memcached** single-item
  queries. The direct, low-level database access path used by
  the `daemon_memcached` plugin is much more
  efficient for key-value lookups than equivalent SQL queries.
- The serialization features of **memcached**,
  which can turn complex data structures, binary files, or even
  code blocks into storable strings, offer a simple way to get
  such objects into a database.
- Because you can access the underlying data through SQL, you
  can produce reports, search or update across multiple keys,
  and call functions such as `AVG()` and
  `MAX()` on **memcached** data.
  All of these operations are expensive or complicated using
  **memcached** by itself.
- You do not need to manually load data into
  **memcached** at startup. As particular keys
  are requested by an application, values are retrieved from the
  database automatically, and cached in memory using the
  `InnoDB`
  [buffer pool](glossary.md#glos_buffer_pool "buffer pool").
- Because **memcached** consumes relatively
  little CPU, and its memory footprint is easy to control, it
  can run comfortably alongside a MySQL instance on the same
  system.
- Because data consistency is enforced by mechanisms used for
  regular `InnoDB` tables, you do not have to
  worry about stale **memcached** data or
  fallback logic to query the database in the case of a missing
  key.
