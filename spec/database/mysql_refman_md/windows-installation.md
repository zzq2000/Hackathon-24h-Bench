Important

MySQL 8.0 Server requires the Microsoft Visual C++
2019 Redistributable Package to run on Windows platforms. Users
should make sure the package has been installed on the system
before installing the server. The package is available at the
[Microsoft
Download Center](http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/default.aspx). Additionally, MySQL debug binaries
require Visual Studio 2019 to be installed.

MySQL is available for Microsoft Windows 64-bit operating systems
only. For supported Windows platform information, see
<https://www.mysql.com/support/supportedplatforms/database.html>.

There are different methods to install MySQL on Microsoft Windows.

### MySQL Installer Method

The simplest and recommended method is to download MySQL Installer (for
Windows) and let it install and configure a specific version of
MySQL Server as follows:

1. Download MySQL Installer from <https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/installer/>
   and execute it.

   Note

   Unlike the standard MySQL Installer, the smaller
   `web-community` version does not bundle any
   MySQL applications, but downloads only the MySQL products you
   choose to install.
2. Determine the setup type to use for the initial installation of
   MySQL products. For example:

   - Developer Default: Provides a setup
     type that includes the selected version of MySQL Server and
     other MySQL tools related to MySQL development, such as
     MySQL Workbench.
   - Server Only: Provides a setup for the
     selected version of MySQL Server without other products.
   - Custom: Enables you to select any
     version of MySQL Server and other MySQL products.
3. Install the server instance (and products) and then begin the
   server configuration by following the onscreen instructions. For
   more information about each individual step, see
   [Section 2.3.3.3.1, “MySQL Server Configuration with MySQL Installer”](mysql-installer-workflow.md#mysql-installer-workflow-server "2.3.3.3.1 MySQL Server Configuration with MySQL Installer").

MySQL is now installed. If you configured MySQL as a service, then
Windows automatically starts the MySQL server every time you restart
the system. Also, this process installs the MySQL Installer application on the
local host, which you can use later to upgrade or reconfigure MySQL
server.

Note

If you installed MySQL Workbench on your system, consider using it to
check your new MySQL server connection. By default, the program
automatically start after installing MySQL.

### Additional Installation Information

It is possible to run MySQL as a standard application or as a
Windows service. By using a service, you can monitor and control the
operation of the server through the standard Windows service
management tools. For more information, see
[Section 2.3.4.8, “Starting MySQL as a Windows Service”](windows-start-service.md "2.3.4.8 Starting MySQL as a Windows Service").

To accommodate the [`RESTART`](restart.md "15.7.8.8 RESTART Statement") statement,
the MySQL server forks when run as a service or standalone, to
enable a monitor process to supervise the server process. In this
case, there are two [**mysqld**](mysqld.md "6.3.1 mysqld — The MySQL Server") processes. If
[`RESTART`](restart.md "15.7.8.8 RESTART Statement") capability is not required,
the server can be started with the
[`--no-monitor`](server-options.md#option_mysqld_no-monitor) option. See
[Section 15.7.8.8, “RESTART Statement”](restart.md "15.7.8.8 RESTART Statement").

Generally, you should install MySQL on Windows using an account that
has administrator rights. Otherwise, you may encounter problems with
certain operations such as editing the `PATH`
environment variable or accessing the **Service Control
Manager**. When installed, MySQL does not need to be
executed using a user with Administrator privileges.

For a list of limitations on the use of MySQL on the Windows
platform, see [Section 2.3.7, “Windows Platform Restrictions”](windows-restrictions.md "2.3.7 Windows Platform Restrictions").

In addition to the MySQL Server package, you may need or want
additional components to use MySQL with your application or
development environment. These include, but are not limited to:

- To connect to the MySQL server using ODBC, you must have a
  Connector/ODBC driver. For more information, including
  installation and configuration instructions, see
  [MySQL Connector/ODBC Developer Guide](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/connector-odbc/en/).

  Note

  MySQL Installer installs and configures Connector/ODBC for you.
- To use MySQL server with .NET applications, you must have the
  Connector/NET driver. For more information, including installation and
  configuration instructions, see [MySQL Connector/NET Developer Guide](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/connector-net/en/).

  Note

  MySQL Installer installs and configures MySQL Connector/NET for you.

MySQL distributions for Windows can be downloaded from
<https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/>. See
[Section 2.1.3, “How to Get MySQL”](getting-mysql.md "2.1.3 How to Get MySQL").

MySQL for Windows is available in several distribution formats,
detailed here. Generally speaking, you should use MySQL Installer. It contains
more features and MySQL products than the older MSI, is simpler to
use than the compressed file, and you need no additional tools to
get MySQL up and running. MySQL Installer automatically installs MySQL Server
and additional MySQL products, creates an options file, starts the
server, and enables you to create default user accounts. For more
information on choosing a package, see
[Section 2.3.2, “Choosing an Installation Package”](windows-choosing-package.md "2.3.2 Choosing an Installation Package").

- A MySQL Installer distribution includes MySQL Server and additional MySQL
  products including MySQL Workbench, and MySQL for Visual Studio. MySQL Installer can also be
  used to upgrade these products in the future (see
  <https://dev.mysql.com/doc/mysql-compat-matrix/en/>).

  For instructions on installing MySQL using MySQL Installer, see
  [Section 2.3.3, “MySQL Installer for Windows”](mysql-installer.md "2.3.3 MySQL Installer for Windows").
- The standard binary distribution (packaged as a compressed file)
  contains all of the necessary files that you unpack into your
  chosen location. This package contains all of the files in the
  full Windows MSI Installer package, but does not include an
  installation program.

  For instructions on installing MySQL using the compressed file,
  see [Section 2.3.4, “Installing MySQL on Microsoft Windows Using a
  `noinstall` ZIP Archive”](windows-install-archive.md "2.3.4 Installing MySQL on Microsoft Windows Using a noinstall ZIP Archive").
- The source distribution format contains all the code and support
  files for building the executables using the Visual Studio
  compiler system.

  For instructions on building MySQL from source on Windows, see
  [Section 2.8, “Installing MySQL from Source”](source-installation.md "2.8 Installing MySQL from Source").

### MySQL on Windows Considerations

- **Large Table Support**

  If you need tables with a size larger than 4GB, install MySQL on
  an NTFS or newer file system. Do not forget to use
  `MAX_ROWS` and
  `AVG_ROW_LENGTH` when you create tables. See
  [Section 15.1.20, “CREATE TABLE Statement”](create-table.md "15.1.20 CREATE TABLE Statement").
- **MySQL and Virus Checking
  Software**

  Virus-scanning software such as Norton/Symantec Anti-Virus on
  directories containing MySQL data and temporary tables can cause
  issues, both in terms of the performance of MySQL and the
  virus-scanning software misidentifying the contents of the files
  as containing spam. This is due to the fingerprinting mechanism
  used by the virus-scanning software, and the way in which MySQL
  rapidly updates different files, which may be identified as a
  potential security risk.

  After installing MySQL Server, it is recommended that you
  disable virus scanning on the main directory
  ([`datadir`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_datadir)) used to store your
  MySQL table data. There is usually a system built into the
  virus-scanning software to enable specific directories to be
  ignored.

  In addition, by default, MySQL creates temporary files in the
  standard Windows temporary directory. To prevent the temporary
  files also being scanned, configure a separate temporary
  directory for MySQL temporary files and add this directory to
  the virus scanning exclusion list. To do this, add a
  configuration option for the
  [`tmpdir`](server-options.md#option_mysqld_tmpdir) parameter to your
  `my.ini` configuration file. For more
  information, see [Section 2.3.4.2, “Creating an Option File”](windows-create-option-file.md "2.3.4.2 Creating an Option File").
