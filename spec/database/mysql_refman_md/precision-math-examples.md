### 14.24.5 Precision Math Examples

This section provides some examples that show precision math query
results in MySQL. These examples demonstrate the principles
described in [Section 14.24.3, “Expression Handling”](precision-math-expressions.md "14.24.3 Expression Handling"), and
[Section 14.24.4, “Rounding Behavior”](precision-math-rounding.md "14.24.4 Rounding Behavior").

**Example 1**. Numbers are used with
their exact value as given when possible:

```sql
mysql> SELECT (.1 + .2) = .3;
+----------------+
| (.1 + .2) = .3 |
+----------------+
|              1 |
+----------------+
```

For floating-point values, results are inexact:

```sql
mysql> SELECT (.1E0 + .2E0) = .3E0;
+----------------------+
| (.1E0 + .2E0) = .3E0 |
+----------------------+
|                    0 |
+----------------------+
```

Another way to see the difference in exact and approximate value
handling is to add a small number to a sum many times. Consider
the following stored procedure, which adds
`.0001` to a variable 1,000 times.

```sql
CREATE PROCEDURE p ()
BEGIN
  DECLARE i INT DEFAULT 0;
  DECLARE d DECIMAL(10,4) DEFAULT 0;
  DECLARE f FLOAT DEFAULT 0;
  WHILE i < 10000 DO
    SET d = d + .0001;
    SET f = f + .0001E0;
    SET i = i + 1;
  END WHILE;
  SELECT d, f;
END;
```

The sum for both `d` and `f`
logically should be 1, but that is true only for the decimal
calculation. The floating-point calculation introduces small
errors:

```none
+--------+------------------+
| d      | f                |
+--------+------------------+
| 1.0000 | 0.99999999999991 |
+--------+------------------+
```

**Example 2**. Multiplication is
performed with the scale required by standard SQL. That is, for
two numbers *`X1`* and
*`X2`* that have scale
*`S1`* and *`S2`*,
the scale of the result is `S1
+ S2`:

```sql
mysql> SELECT .01 * .01;
+-----------+
| .01 * .01 |
+-----------+
| 0.0001    |
+-----------+
```

**Example 3**. Rounding behavior for
exact-value numbers is well-defined:

Rounding behavior (for example, with the
[`ROUND()`](mathematical-functions.md#function_round) function) is independent of
the implementation of the underlying C library, which means that
results are consistent from platform to platform.

- Rounding for exact-value columns
  ([`DECIMAL`](fixed-point-types.md "13.1.3 Fixed-Point Types (Exact Value) - DECIMAL, NUMERIC") and integer) and
  exact-valued numbers uses the “round half away from
  zero” rule. A value with a fractional part of .5 or
  greater is rounded away from zero to the nearest integer, as
  shown here:

  ```sql
  mysql> SELECT ROUND(2.5), ROUND(-2.5);
  +------------+-------------+
  | ROUND(2.5) | ROUND(-2.5) |
  +------------+-------------+
  | 3          | -3          |
  +------------+-------------+
  ```
- Rounding for floating-point values uses the C library, which
  on many systems uses the “round to nearest even”
  rule. A value with a fractional part exactly half way between
  two integers is rounded to the nearest even integer:

  ```sql
  mysql> SELECT ROUND(2.5E0), ROUND(-2.5E0);
  +--------------+---------------+
  | ROUND(2.5E0) | ROUND(-2.5E0) |
  +--------------+---------------+
  |            2 |            -2 |
  +--------------+---------------+
  ```

**Example 4**. In strict mode,
inserting a value that is out of range for a column causes an
error, rather than truncation to a legal value.

When MySQL is not running in strict mode, truncation to a legal
value occurs:

```sql
mysql> SET sql_mode='';
Query OK, 0 rows affected (0.00 sec)

mysql> CREATE TABLE t (i TINYINT);
Query OK, 0 rows affected (0.01 sec)

mysql> INSERT INTO t SET i = 128;
Query OK, 1 row affected, 1 warning (0.00 sec)

mysql> SELECT i FROM t;
+------+
| i    |
+------+
|  127 |
+------+
1 row in set (0.00 sec)
```

However, an error occurs if strict mode is in effect:

```sql
mysql> SET sql_mode='STRICT_ALL_TABLES';
Query OK, 0 rows affected (0.00 sec)

mysql> CREATE TABLE t (i TINYINT);
Query OK, 0 rows affected (0.00 sec)

mysql> INSERT INTO t SET i = 128;
ERROR 1264 (22003): Out of range value adjusted for column 'i' at row 1

mysql> SELECT i FROM t;
Empty set (0.00 sec)
```

**Example 5**: In strict mode and
with [`ERROR_FOR_DIVISION_BY_ZERO`](sql-mode.md#sqlmode_error_for_division_by_zero)
set, division by zero causes an error, not a result of
`NULL`.

In nonstrict mode, division by zero has a result of
`NULL`:

```sql
mysql> SET sql_mode='';
Query OK, 0 rows affected (0.01 sec)

mysql> CREATE TABLE t (i TINYINT);
Query OK, 0 rows affected (0.00 sec)

mysql> INSERT INTO t SET i = 1 / 0;
Query OK, 1 row affected (0.00 sec)

mysql> SELECT i FROM t;
+------+
| i    |
+------+
| NULL |
+------+
1 row in set (0.03 sec)
```

However, division by zero is an error if the proper SQL modes are
in effect:

```sql
mysql> SET sql_mode='STRICT_ALL_TABLES,ERROR_FOR_DIVISION_BY_ZERO';
Query OK, 0 rows affected (0.00 sec)

mysql> CREATE TABLE t (i TINYINT);
Query OK, 0 rows affected (0.00 sec)

mysql> INSERT INTO t SET i = 1 / 0;
ERROR 1365 (22012): Division by 0

mysql> SELECT i FROM t;
Empty set (0.01 sec)
```

**Example 6**. Exact-value literals
are evaluated as exact values.

Approximate-value literals are evaluated using floating point, but
exact-value literals are handled as
[`DECIMAL`](fixed-point-types.md "13.1.3 Fixed-Point Types (Exact Value) - DECIMAL, NUMERIC"):

```sql
mysql> CREATE TABLE t SELECT 2.5 AS a, 25E-1 AS b;
Query OK, 1 row affected (0.01 sec)
Records: 1  Duplicates: 0  Warnings: 0

mysql> DESCRIBE t;
+-------+-----------------------+------+-----+---------+-------+
| Field | Type                  | Null | Key | Default | Extra |
+-------+-----------------------+------+-----+---------+-------+
| a     | decimal(2,1) unsigned | NO   |     | 0.0     |       |
| b     | double                | NO   |     | 0       |       |
+-------+-----------------------+------+-----+---------+-------+
2 rows in set (0.01 sec)
```

**Example 7**. If the argument to an
aggregate function is an exact numeric type, the result is also an
exact numeric type, with a scale at least that of the argument.

Consider these statements:

```sql
mysql> CREATE TABLE t (i INT, d DECIMAL, f FLOAT);
mysql> INSERT INTO t VALUES(1,1,1);
mysql> CREATE TABLE y SELECT AVG(i), AVG(d), AVG(f) FROM t;
```

The result is a double only for the floating-point argument. For
exact type arguments, the result is also an exact type:

```sql
mysql> DESCRIBE y;
+--------+---------------+------+-----+---------+-------+
| Field  | Type          | Null | Key | Default | Extra |
+--------+---------------+------+-----+---------+-------+
| AVG(i) | decimal(14,4) | YES  |     | NULL    |       |
| AVG(d) | decimal(14,4) | YES  |     | NULL    |       |
| AVG(f) | double        | YES  |     | NULL    |       |
+--------+---------------+------+-----+---------+-------+
```

The result is a double only for the floating-point argument. For
exact type arguments, the result is also an exact type.
