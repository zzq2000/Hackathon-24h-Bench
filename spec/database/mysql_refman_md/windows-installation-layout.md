### 2.3.1 MySQL Installation Layout on Microsoft Windows

For MySQL 8.0 on Windows, the default installation
directory is `C:\Program Files\MySQL\MySQL Server
8.0` for installations performed with MySQL Installer.
If you use the ZIP archive method to install MySQL, you may prefer
to install in `C:\mysql`. However, the layout
of the subdirectories remains the same.

All of the files are located within this parent directory, using
the structure shown in the following table.

**Table 2.4 Default MySQL Installation Layout for Microsoft Windows**
