### 25.7.8 Implementing Failover with NDB Cluster Replication

In the event that the primary Cluster replication process fails,
it is possible to switch over to the secondary replication
channel. The following procedure describes the steps required to
accomplish this.

1. Obtain the time of the most recent global checkpoint (GCP).
   That is, you need to determine the most recent epoch from the
   `ndb_apply_status` table on the replica
   cluster, which can be found using the following query:

   ```sql
   mysqlR'> SELECT @latest:=MAX(epoch)
         ->        FROM mysql.ndb_apply_status;
   ```

   In a circular replication topology, with a source and a
   replica running on each host, when you are using
   [`ndb_log_apply_status=1`](mysql-cluster-options-variables.md#sysvar_ndb_log_apply_status), NDB
   Cluster epochs are written in the replicas' binary logs.
   This means that the `ndb_apply_status` table
   contains information for the replica on this host as well as
   for any other host which acts as a replica of the replication
   source server running on this host.

   In this case, you need to determine the latest epoch on this
   replica to the exclusion of any epochs from any other replicas
   in this replica's binary log that were not listed in the
   `IGNORE_SERVER_IDS` options of the
   [`CHANGE REPLICATION SOURCE TO`](change-replication-source-to.md "15.4.2.3 CHANGE REPLICATION SOURCE TO Statement") |
   [`CHANGE MASTER TO`](change-master-to.md "15.4.2.1 CHANGE MASTER TO Statement") statement used
   to set up this replica. The reason for excluding such epochs
   is that rows in the `mysql.ndb_apply_status`
   table whose server IDs have a match in the
   `IGNORE_SERVER_IDS` list from the
   [`CHANGE REPLICATION SOURCE TO`](change-replication-source-to.md "15.4.2.3 CHANGE REPLICATION SOURCE TO Statement") |
   `CHANGE MASTER TO` statement used to prepare
   this replicas's source are also considered to be from
   local servers, in addition to those having the replica's
   own server ID. You can retrieve this list as
   `Replicate_Ignore_Server_Ids` from the output
   of [`SHOW REPLICA STATUS`](show-replica-status.md "15.7.7.35 SHOW REPLICA STATUS Statement"). We
   assume that you have obtained this list and are substituting
   it for *`ignore_server_ids`* in the
   query shown here, which like the previous version of the
   query, selects the greatest epoch into a variable named
   `@latest`:

   ```sql
   mysqlR'> SELECT @latest:=MAX(epoch)
         ->        FROM mysql.ndb_apply_status
         ->        WHERE server_id NOT IN (ignore_server_ids);
   ```

   In some cases, it may be simpler or more efficient (or both)
   to use a list of the server IDs to be included and
   `server_id IN
   server_id_list` in the
   `WHERE` condition of the preceding query.
2. Using the information obtained from the query shown in Step 1,
   obtain the corresponding records from the
   `ndb_binlog_index` table on the source
   cluster.

   You can use the following query to obtain the needed records
   from the `ndb_binlog_index` table on the
   source:

   ```sql
   mysqlS'> SELECT
       ->     @file:=SUBSTRING_INDEX(next_file, '/', -1),
       ->     @pos:=next_position
       -> FROM mysql.ndb_binlog_index
       -> WHERE epoch = @latest;
   ```

   These are the records saved on the source since the failure of
   the primary replication channel. We have employed a user
   variable `@latest` here to represent the
   value obtained in Step 1. Of course, it is not possible for
   one [**mysqld**](mysqld.md "6.3.1 mysqld — The MySQL Server") instance to access user
   variables set on another server instance directly. These
   values must be “plugged in” to the second query
   manually or by an application.

   Important

   You must ensure that the replica [**mysqld**](mysqld.md "6.3.1 mysqld — The MySQL Server")
   is started with
   [`--slave-skip-errors=ddl_exist_errors`](replication-options-replica.md#option_mysqld_slave-skip-errors)
   before executing [`START
   REPLICA`](start-replica.md "15.4.2.6 START REPLICA Statement"). Otherwise, replication may stop with
   duplicate DDL errors.
3. Now it is possible to synchronize the secondary channel by
   running the following query on the secondary replica server:

   ```sql
   mysqlR'> CHANGE MASTER TO
         ->     MASTER_LOG_FILE='@file',
         ->     MASTER_LOG_POS=@pos;
   ```

   In NDB 8.0.23 and later, you can also use the statement shown
   here:

   ```sql
   mysqlR'> CHANGE REPLICATION SOURCE TO
         ->     SOURCE_LOG_FILE='@file',
         ->     SOURCE_LOG_POS=@pos;
   ```

   Again we have employed user variables (in this case
   `@file` and `@pos`) to
   represent the values obtained in Step 2 and applied in Step 3;
   in practice these values must be inserted manually or using an
   application that can access both of the servers involved.

   Note

   `@file` is a string value such as
   `'/var/log/mysql/replication-source-bin.00001'`,
   and so must be quoted when used in SQL or application code.
   However, the value represented by `@pos`
   must *not* be quoted. Although MySQL
   normally attempts to convert strings to numbers, this case
   is an exception.
4. You can now initiate replication on the secondary channel by
   issuing the appropriate command on the secondary replica
   [**mysqld**](mysqld.md "6.3.1 mysqld — The MySQL Server"):

   ```sql
   mysqlR'> START SLAVE;
   ```

   In NDB 8.0.22 or later, you can also use the following
   statement:

   ```sql
   mysqlR'> START REPLICA;
   ```

Once the secondary replication channel is active, you can
investigate the failure of the primary and effect repairs. The
precise actions required to do this depend upon the reasons for
which the primary channel failed.

Warning

The secondary replication channel is to be started only if and
when the primary replication channel has failed. Running
multiple replication channels simultaneously can result in
unwanted duplicate records being created on the replicas.

If the failure is limited to a single server, it should in theory
be possible to replicate from *`S`* to
*`R'`*, or from
*`S'`* to *`R`*.
