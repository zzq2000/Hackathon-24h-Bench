## 29.1 Performance Schema Quick Start

This section briefly introduces the Performance Schema with
examples that show how to use it. For additional examples, see
[Section 29.19, “Using the Performance Schema to Diagnose Problems”](performance-schema-examples.md "29.19 Using the Performance Schema to Diagnose Problems").

The Performance Schema is enabled by default. To enable or disable
it explicitly, start the server with the
[`performance_schema`](performance-schema-system-variables.md#sysvar_performance_schema) variable set
to an appropriate value. For example, use these lines in the
server `my.cnf` file:

```ini
[mysqld]
performance_schema=ON
```

When the server starts, it sees
[`performance_schema`](performance-schema-system-variables.md#sysvar_performance_schema) and attempts
to initialize the Performance Schema. To verify successful
initialization, use this statement:

```sql
mysql> SHOW VARIABLES LIKE 'performance_schema';
+--------------------+-------+
| Variable_name      | Value |
+--------------------+-------+
| performance_schema | ON    |
+--------------------+-------+
```

A value of `ON` means that the Performance Schema
initialized successfully and is ready for use. A value of
`OFF` means that some error occurred. Check the
server error log for information about what went wrong.

The Performance Schema is implemented as a storage engine, so you
can see it listed in the output from the Information Schema
[`ENGINES`](information-schema-engines-table.md "28.3.13 The INFORMATION_SCHEMA ENGINES Table") table or the
[`SHOW ENGINES`](show-engines.md "15.7.7.16 SHOW ENGINES Statement") statement:

```sql
mysql> SELECT * FROM INFORMATION_SCHEMA.ENGINES
       WHERE ENGINE='PERFORMANCE_SCHEMA'\G
*************************** 1. row ***************************
      ENGINE: PERFORMANCE_SCHEMA
     SUPPORT: YES
     COMMENT: Performance Schema
TRANSACTIONS: NO
          XA: NO
  SAVEPOINTS: NO

mysql> SHOW ENGINES\G
...
      Engine: PERFORMANCE_SCHEMA
     Support: YES
     Comment: Performance Schema
Transactions: NO
          XA: NO
  Savepoints: NO
...
```

The [`PERFORMANCE_SCHEMA`](performance-schema.md "Chapter 29 MySQL Performance Schema") storage engine
operates on tables in the `performance_schema`
database. You can make `performance_schema` the
default database so that references to its tables need not be
qualified with the database name:

```sql
mysql> USE performance_schema;
```

Performance Schema tables are stored in the
`performance_schema` database. Information about
the structure of this database and its tables can be obtained, as
for any other database, by selecting from the
`INFORMATION_SCHEMA` database or by using
[`SHOW`](show.md "15.7.7 SHOW Statements") statements. For example, use
either of these statements to see what Performance Schema tables
exist:

```sql
mysql> SELECT TABLE_NAME FROM INFORMATION_SCHEMA.TABLES
       WHERE TABLE_SCHEMA = 'performance_schema';
+------------------------------------------------------+

The number of Performance Schema tables increases over time as
implementation of additional instrumentation proceeds.

The name of the `performance_schema` database is
lowercase, as are the names of tables within it. Queries should
specify the names in lowercase.

To see the structure of individual tables, use
[`SHOW CREATE TABLE`](show-create-table.md "15.7.7.10 SHOW CREATE TABLE Statement"):

```sql
mysql> SHOW CREATE TABLE performance_schema.setup_consumers\G
*************************** 1. row ***************************
       Table: setup_consumers
Create Table: CREATE TABLE `setup_consumers` (
  `NAME` varchar(64) NOT NULL,
  `ENABLED` enum('YES','NO') NOT NULL,
  PRIMARY KEY (`NAME`)
) ENGINE=PERFORMANCE_SCHEMA DEFAULT CHARSET=utf8mb4 COLLATE=utf8mb4_0900_ai_ci
```

Table structure is also available by selecting from tables such as
[`INFORMATION_SCHEMA.COLUMNS`](information-schema-columns-table.md "28.3.8 The INFORMATION_SCHEMA COLUMNS Table") or by
using statements such as [`SHOW
COLUMNS`](show-columns.md "15.7.7.5 SHOW COLUMNS Statement").

Tables in the `performance_schema` database can
be grouped according to the type of information in them: Current
events, event histories and summaries, object instances, and setup
(configuration) information. The following examples illustrate a
few uses for these tables. For detailed information about the
tables in each group, see
[Section 29.12, “Performance Schema Table Descriptions”](performance-schema-table-descriptions.md "29.12 Performance Schema Table Descriptions").

Initially, not all instruments and consumers are enabled, so the
performance schema does not collect all events. To turn all of
these on and enable event timing, execute two statements (the row
counts may differ depending on MySQL version):

```sql
mysql> UPDATE performance_schema.setup_instruments
       SET ENABLED = 'YES', TIMED = 'YES';
Query OK, 560 rows affected (0.04 sec)
mysql> UPDATE performance_schema.setup_consumers
       SET ENABLED = 'YES';
Query OK, 10 rows affected (0.00 sec)
```

To see what the server is doing at the moment, examine the
[`events_waits_current`](performance-schema-events-waits-current-table.md "29.12.4.1 The events_waits_current Table") table. It
contains one row per thread showing each thread's most recent
monitored event:

```sql
mysql> SELECT *
       FROM performance_schema.events_waits_current\G
*************************** 1. row ***************************
            THREAD_ID: 0
             EVENT_ID: 5523
         END_EVENT_ID: 5523
           EVENT_NAME: wait/synch/mutex/mysys/THR_LOCK::mutex
               SOURCE: thr_lock.c:525
          TIMER_START: 201660494489586
            TIMER_END: 201660494576112
           TIMER_WAIT: 86526
                SPINS: NULL
        OBJECT_SCHEMA: NULL
          OBJECT_NAME: NULL
           INDEX_NAME: NULL
          OBJECT_TYPE: NULL
OBJECT_INSTANCE_BEGIN: 142270668
     NESTING_EVENT_ID: NULL
   NESTING_EVENT_TYPE: NULL
            OPERATION: lock
      NUMBER_OF_BYTES: NULL
                FLAGS: 0
...
```

This event indicates that thread 0 was waiting for 86,526
picoseconds to acquire a lock on
`THR_LOCK::mutex`, a mutex in the
`mysys` subsystem. The first few columns provide
the following information:

- The ID columns indicate which thread the event comes from and
  the event number.
- `EVENT_NAME` indicates what was instrumented
  and `SOURCE` indicates which source file
  contains the instrumented code.
- The timer columns show when the event started and stopped and
  how long it took. If an event is still in progress, the
  `TIMER_END` and `TIMER_WAIT`
  values are `NULL`. Timer values are
  approximate and expressed in picoseconds. For information
  about timers and event time collection, see
  [Section 29.4.1, “Performance Schema Event Timing”](performance-schema-timing.md "29.4.1 Performance Schema Event Timing").

The history tables contain the same kind of rows as the
current-events table but have more rows and show what the server
has been doing “recently” rather than
“currently.” The
[`events_waits_history`](performance-schema-events-waits-history-table.md "29.12.4.2 The events_waits_history Table") and
[`events_waits_history_long`](performance-schema-events-waits-history-long-table.md "29.12.4.3 The events_waits_history_long Table") tables
contain the most recent 10 events per thread and most recent
10,000 events, respectively. For example, to see information for
recent events produced by thread 13, do this:

```sql
mysql> SELECT EVENT_ID, EVENT_NAME, TIMER_WAIT
       FROM performance_schema.events_waits_history
       WHERE THREAD_ID = 13
       ORDER BY EVENT_ID;
+----------+-----------------------------------------+------------+
| EVENT_ID | EVENT_NAME                              | TIMER_WAIT |
+----------+-----------------------------------------+------------+

|       95 | wait/synch/mutex/mysys/LOCK_alarm       |     312993 |
+----------+-----------------------------------------+------------+
```

As new events are added to a history table, older events are
discarded if the table is full.

Summary tables provide aggregated information for all events over
time. The tables in this group summarize event data in different
ways. To see which instruments have been executed the most times
or have taken the most wait time, sort the
[`events_waits_summary_global_by_event_name`](performance-schema-wait-summary-tables.md "29.12.20.1 Wait Event Summary Tables")
table on the `COUNT_STAR` or
`SUM_TIMER_WAIT` column, which correspond to a
`COUNT(*)` or `SUM(TIMER_WAIT)`
value, respectively, calculated over all events:

```sql
mysql> SELECT EVENT_NAME, COUNT_STAR
       FROM performance_schema.events_waits_summary_global_by_event_name
       ORDER BY COUNT_STAR DESC LIMIT 10;
+---------------------------------------------------+------------+

```

These results show that the `THR_LOCK_malloc`
mutex is “hot,” both in terms of how often it is used
and amount of time that threads wait attempting to acquire it.

Note

The `THR_LOCK_malloc` mutex is used only in
debug builds. In production builds it is not hot because it is
nonexistent.

Instance tables document what types of objects are instrumented.
An instrumented object, when used by the server, produces an
event. These tables provide event names and explanatory notes or
status information. For example, the
[`file_instances`](performance-schema-file-instances-table.md "29.12.3.2 The file_instances Table") table lists instances
of instruments for file I/O operations and their associated files:

```sql
mysql> SELECT *
       FROM performance_schema.file_instances\G
*************************** 1. row ***************************
 FILE_NAME: /opt/mysql-log/60500/binlog.000007
EVENT_NAME: wait/io/file/sql/binlog
OPEN_COUNT: 0
*************************** 2. row ***************************
 FILE_NAME: /opt/mysql/60500/data/mysql/tables_priv.MYI
EVENT_NAME: wait/io/file/myisam/kfile
OPEN_COUNT: 1
*************************** 3. row ***************************
 FILE_NAME: /opt/mysql/60500/data/mysql/columns_priv.MYI
EVENT_NAME: wait/io/file/myisam/kfile
OPEN_COUNT: 1
...
```

Setup tables are used to configure and display monitoring
characteristics. For example,
[`setup_instruments`](performance-schema-setup-instruments-table.md "29.12.2.3 The setup_instruments Table") lists the set of
instruments for which events can be collected and shows which of
them are enabled:

```sql
mysql> SELECT NAME, ENABLED, TIMED
       FROM performance_schema.setup_instruments;
+---------------------------------------------------+---------+-------+
| NAME                                              | ENABLED | TIMED |

```

To understand how to interpret instrument names, see
[Section 29.6, “Performance Schema Instrument Naming Conventions”](performance-schema-instrument-naming.md "29.6 Performance Schema Instrument Naming Conventions").

To control whether events are collected for an instrument, set its
`ENABLED` value to `YES` or
`NO`. For example:

```sql
mysql> UPDATE performance_schema.setup_instruments
       SET ENABLED = 'NO'
       WHERE NAME = 'wait/synch/mutex/sql/LOCK_mysql_create_db';
```

The Performance Schema uses collected events to update tables in
the `performance_schema` database, which act as
“consumers” of event information. The
[`setup_consumers`](performance-schema-setup-consumers-table.md "29.12.2.2 The setup_consumers Table") table lists the
available consumers and which are enabled:

```sql
mysql> SELECT * FROM performance_schema.setup_consumers;
+----------------------------------+---------+
| NAME                             | ENABLED |
+----------------------------------+---------+
| events_stages_current            | NO      |
| events_stages_history            | NO      |
| events_stages_history_long       | NO      |
| events_statements_cpu            | NO      |
| events_statements_current        | YES     |
| events_statements_history        | YES     |

| events_waits_history             | NO      |
| events_waits_history_long        | NO      |
| global_instrumentation           | YES     |
| thread_instrumentation           | YES     |
| statements_digest                | YES     |
+----------------------------------+---------+
```

To control whether the Performance Schema maintains a consumer as
a destination for event information, set its
`ENABLED` value.

For more information about the setup tables and how to use them to
control event collection, see
[Section 29.4.2, “Performance Schema Event Filtering”](performance-schema-filtering.md "29.4.2 Performance Schema Event Filtering").

There are some miscellaneous tables that do not fall into any of
the previous groups. For example,
[`performance_timers`](performance-schema-performance-timers-table.md "29.12.21.6 The performance_timers Table") lists the
available event timers and their characteristics. For information
about timers, see [Section 29.4.1, “Performance Schema Event Timing”](performance-schema-timing.md "29.4.1 Performance Schema Event Timing").
