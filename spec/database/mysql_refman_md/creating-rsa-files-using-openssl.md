#### 8.3.3.3 Creating RSA Keys Using openssl

This section describes how to use the **openssl**
command to set up the RSA key files that enable MySQL to support
secure password exchange over unencrypted connections for
accounts authenticated by the `sha256_password`
and `caching_sha2_password` plugins.

Note

There are easier alternatives to generating the files required
for RSA than the procedure described here: Let the server
autogenerate them or use the
[**mysql\_ssl\_rsa\_setup**](mysql-ssl-rsa-setup.md "6.4.3 mysql_ssl_rsa_setup — Create SSL/RSA Files") program (deprecated as
of MySQL 8.0.34). See
[Section 8.3.3.1, “Creating SSL and RSA Certificates and Keys using MySQL”](creating-ssl-rsa-files-using-mysql.md "8.3.3.1 Creating SSL and RSA Certificates and Keys using MySQL").

To create the RSA private and public key-pair files, run these
commands while logged into the system account used to run the
MySQL server so that the files are owned by that account:

```terminal
openssl genrsa -out private_key.pem 2048
openssl rsa -in private_key.pem -pubout -out public_key.pem
```

Those commands create 2,048-bit keys. To create stronger keys,
use a larger value.

Then set the access modes for the key files. The private key
should be readable only by the server, whereas the public key
can be freely distributed to client users:

```terminal
chmod 400 private_key.pem
chmod 444 public_key.pem
```
