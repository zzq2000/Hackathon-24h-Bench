#### 6.2.2.6 Option Defaults, Options Expecting Values, and the = Sign

By convention, long forms of options that assign a value are
written with an equals (`=`) sign, like this:

```terminal
mysql --host=tonfisk --user=jon
```

For options that require a value (that is, not having a default
value), the equal sign is not required, and so the following is
also valid:

```terminal
mysql --host tonfisk --user jon
```

In both cases, the [**mysql**](mysql.md "6.5.1 mysql — The MySQL Command-Line Client") client attempts to
connect to a MySQL server running on the host named
“tonfisk” using an account with the user name
“jon”.

Due to this behavior, problems can occasionally arise when no
value is provided for an option that expects one. Consider the
following example, where a user connects to a MySQL server
running on host `tonfisk` as user
`jon`:

```terminal
$> mysql --host 85.224.35.45 --user jon
Welcome to the MySQL monitor.  Commands end with ; or \g.
Your MySQL connection id is 3
Server version: 8.0.45 Source distribution

Type 'help;' or '\h' for help. Type '\c' to clear the buffer.

mysql> SELECT CURRENT_USER();
+----------------+
| CURRENT_USER() |
+----------------+
| jon@%          |
+----------------+
1 row in set (0.00 sec)
```

Omitting the required value for one of these option yields an
error, such as the one shown here:

```terminal
$> mysql --host 85.224.35.45 --user
mysql: option '--user' requires an argument
```

In this case, [**mysql**](mysql.md "6.5.1 mysql — The MySQL Command-Line Client") was unable to find a
value following the [`--user`](connection-options.md#option_general_user)
option because nothing came after it on the command line.
However, if you omit the value for an option that is
*not* the last option to be used, you obtain
a different error that you may not be expecting:

```terminal
$> mysql --host --user jon
ERROR 2005 (HY000): Unknown MySQL server host '--user' (1)
```

Because [**mysql**](mysql.md "6.5.1 mysql — The MySQL Command-Line Client") assumes that any string
following [`--host`](connection-options.md#option_general_host) on the command
line is a host name, [`--host`](connection-options.md#option_general_host)
[`--user`](connection-options.md#option_general_user) is interpreted as
[`--host=--user`](connection-options.md#option_general_host), and the client
attempts to connect to a MySQL server running on a host named
“--user”.

Options having default values always require an equal sign when
assigning a value; failing to do so causes an error. For
example, the MySQL server
[`--log-error`](server-options.md#option_mysqld_log-error) option has the
default value
`host_name.err`,
where *`host_name`* is the name of the
host on which MySQL is running. Assume that you are running
MySQL on a computer whose host name is “tonfisk”,
and consider the following invocation of
[**mysqld\_safe**](mysqld-safe.md "6.3.2 mysqld_safe — MySQL Server Startup Script"):

```terminal
$> mysqld_safe &
[1] 11699
$> 080112 12:53:40 mysqld_safe Logging to '/usr/local/mysql/var/tonfisk.err'.
080112 12:53:40 mysqld_safe Starting mysqld daemon with databases from /usr/local/mysql/var
$>
```

After shutting down the server, restart it as follows:

```terminal
$> mysqld_safe --log-error &
[1] 11699
$> 080112 12:53:40 mysqld_safe Logging to '/usr/local/mysql/var/tonfisk.err'.
080112 12:53:40 mysqld_safe Starting mysqld daemon with databases from /usr/local/mysql/var
$>
```

The result is the same, since
[`--log-error`](mysqld-safe.md#option_mysqld_safe_log-error) is not followed
by anything else on the command line, and it supplies its own
default value. (The `&` character tells the
operating system to run MySQL in the background; it is ignored
by MySQL itself.) Now suppose that you wish to log errors to a
file named `my-errors.err`. You might try
starting the server with `--log-error my-errors`,
but this does not have the intended effect, as shown here:

```terminal
$> mysqld_safe --log-error my-errors &
[1] 31357
$> 080111 22:53:31 mysqld_safe Logging to '/usr/local/mysql/var/tonfisk.err'.
080111 22:53:32 mysqld_safe Starting mysqld daemon with databases from /usr/local/mysql/var
080111 22:53:34 mysqld_safe mysqld from pid file /usr/local/mysql/var/tonfisk.pid ended

[1]+  Done                    ./mysqld_safe --log-error my-errors
```

The server attempted to start using
`/usr/local/mysql/var/tonfisk.err` as the
error log, but then shut down. Examining the last few lines of
this file shows the reason:

```terminal
$> tail /usr/local/mysql/var/tonfisk.err
2013-09-24T15:36:22.278034Z 0 [ERROR] Too many arguments (first extra is 'my-errors').
2013-09-24T15:36:22.278059Z 0 [Note] Use --verbose --help to get a list of available options!
2013-09-24T15:36:22.278076Z 0 [ERROR] Aborting
2013-09-24T15:36:22.279704Z 0 [Note] InnoDB: Starting shutdown...
2013-09-24T15:36:23.777471Z 0 [Note] InnoDB: Shutdown completed; log sequence number 2319086
2013-09-24T15:36:23.780134Z 0 [Note] mysqld: Shutdown complete
```

Because the [`--log-error`](mysqld-safe.md#option_mysqld_safe_log-error)
option supplies a default value, you must use an equal sign to
assign a different value to it, as shown here:

```terminal
$> mysqld_safe --log-error=my-errors &
[1] 31437
$> 080111 22:54:15 mysqld_safe Logging to '/usr/local/mysql/var/my-errors.err'.
080111 22:54:15 mysqld_safe Starting mysqld daemon with databases from /usr/local/mysql/var

$>
```

Now the server has been started successfully, and is logging
errors to the file
`/usr/local/mysql/var/my-errors.err`.

Similar issues can arise when specifying option values in option
files. For example, consider a `my.cnf` file
that contains the following:

```ini
[mysql]

host
user
```

When the [**mysql**](mysql.md "6.5.1 mysql — The MySQL Command-Line Client") client reads this file, these
entries are parsed as [`--host`](mysql-command-options.md#option_mysql_host)
[`--user`](mysql-command-options.md#option_mysql_user) or
[`--host=--user`](mysql-command-options.md#option_mysql_host), with the result
shown here:

```terminal
$> mysql
ERROR 2005 (HY000): Unknown MySQL server host '--user' (1)
```

However, in option files, an equal sign is not assumed. Suppose
the `my.cnf` file is as shown here:

```ini
[mysql]

user jon
```

Trying to start [**mysql**](mysql.md "6.5.1 mysql — The MySQL Command-Line Client") in this case causes a
different error:

```terminal
$> mysql
mysql: unknown option '--user jon'
```

A similar error would occur if you were to write `host
tonfisk` in the option file rather than
`host=tonfisk`. Instead, you must use the equal
sign:

```ini
[mysql]

user=jon
```

Now the login attempt succeeds:

```terminal
$> mysql
Welcome to the MySQL monitor.  Commands end with ; or \g.
Your MySQL connection id is 5
Server version: 8.0.45 Source distribution

Type 'help;' or '\h' for help. Type '\c' to clear the buffer.

mysql> SELECT USER();
+---------------+
| USER()        |
+---------------+
| jon@localhost |
+---------------+
1 row in set (0.00 sec)
```

This is not the same behavior as with the command line, where
the equal sign is not required:

```terminal
$> mysql --user jon --host tonfisk
Welcome to the MySQL monitor.  Commands end with ; or \g.
Your MySQL connection id is 6
Server version: 8.0.45 Source distribution

Type 'help;' or '\h' for help. Type '\c' to clear the buffer.

mysql> SELECT USER();
+---------------+
| USER()        |
+---------------+
| jon@tonfisk   |
+---------------+
1 row in set (0.00 sec)
```

Specifying an option requiring a value without a value in an
option file causes the server to abort with an error.
