### 15.1.5 ALTER INSTANCE Statement

```sql
ALTER INSTANCE instance_action

instance_action: {
  | {ENABLE|DISABLE} INNODB REDO_LOG
  | ROTATE INNODB MASTER KEY
  | ROTATE BINLOG MASTER KEY
  | RELOAD TLS
      [FOR CHANNEL {mysql_main | mysql_admin}]
      [NO ROLLBACK ON ERROR]
  | RELOAD KEYRING
}
```

`ALTER INSTANCE` defines actions applicable to a
MySQL server instance. The statement supports these actions:

- `ALTER INSTANCE {ENABLE | DISABLE} INNODB
  REDO_LOG`

  This action enables or disables `InnoDB` redo
  logging. Redo logging is enabled by default. This feature is
  intended only for loading data into a new MySQL instance. The
  statement is not written to the binary log. This action was
  introduced in MySQL 8.0.21.

  Warning

  *Do not disable redo logging on a production
  system.* While it is permitted to shut down and
  restart the server while redo logging is disabled, an
  unexpected server stoppage while redo logging is disabled
  can cause data loss and instance corruption.

  An [`ALTER
  INSTANCE [ENABLE|DISABLE] INNODB REDO_LOG`](alter-instance.md "15.1.5 ALTER INSTANCE Statement") operation
  requires an exclusive backup lock, which prevents other
  [`ALTER INSTANCE`](alter-instance.md "15.1.5 ALTER INSTANCE Statement") operations from
  executing concurrently. Other [`ALTER
  INSTANCE`](alter-instance.md "15.1.5 ALTER INSTANCE Statement") operations must wait for the lock to be
  released before executing.

  For more information, see
  [Disabling Redo Logging](innodb-redo-log.md#innodb-disable-redo-logging "Disabling Redo Logging").
- `ALTER INSTANCE ROTATE INNODB MASTER KEY`

  This action rotates the master encryption key used for
  `InnoDB` tablespace encryption. Key rotation
  requires the
  [`ENCRYPTION_KEY_ADMIN`](privileges-provided.md#priv_encryption-key-admin) or
  [`SUPER`](privileges-provided.md#priv_super) privilege. To perform
  this action, a keyring plugin must be installed and
  configured. For instructions, see [Section 8.4.4, “The MySQL Keyring”](keyring.md "8.4.4 The MySQL Keyring").

  `ALTER INSTANCE ROTATE INNODB MASTER KEY`
  supports concurrent DML. However, it cannot be run
  concurrently with
  [`CREATE TABLE ...
  ENCRYPTION`](create-table.md "15.1.20 CREATE TABLE Statement") or
  [`ALTER TABLE ...
  ENCRYPTION`](alter-table.md "15.1.9 ALTER TABLE Statement") operations, and locks are taken to
  prevent conflicts that could arise from concurrent execution
  of these statements. If one of the conflicting statements is
  running, it must complete before another can proceed.

  `ALTER INSTANCE ROTATE INNODB MASTER KEY`
  statements are written to the binary log so that they can be
  executed on replicated servers.

  For additional `ALTER INSTANCE ROTATE INNODB MASTER
  KEY` usage information, see
  [Section 17.13, “InnoDB Data-at-Rest Encryption”](innodb-data-encryption.md "17.13 InnoDB Data-at-Rest Encryption").
- `ALTER INSTANCE ROTATE BINLOG MASTER KEY`

  This action rotates the binary log master key used for binary
  log encryption. Key rotation for the binary log master key
  requires the
  [`BINLOG_ENCRYPTION_ADMIN`](privileges-provided.md#priv_binlog-encryption-admin) or
  [`SUPER`](privileges-provided.md#priv_super) privilege. The statement
  cannot be used if the
  [`binlog_encryption`](replication-options-binary-log.md#sysvar_binlog_encryption) system
  variable is set to `OFF`. To perform this
  action, a keyring plugin must be installed and configured. For
  instructions, see [Section 8.4.4, “The MySQL Keyring”](keyring.md "8.4.4 The MySQL Keyring").

  `ALTER INSTANCE ROTATE BINLOG MASTER KEY`
  actions are not written to the binary log and are not executed
  on replicas. Binary log master key rotation can therefore be
  carried out in replication environments including a mix of
  MySQL versions. To schedule regular rotation of the binary log
  master key on all applicable source and replica servers, you
  can enable the MySQL Event Scheduler on each server and issue
  the `ALTER INSTANCE ROTATE BINLOG MASTER KEY`
  statement using a [`CREATE EVENT`](create-event.md "15.1.13 CREATE EVENT Statement")
  statement. If you rotate the binary log master key because you
  suspect that the current or any of the previous binary log
  master keys might have been compromised, issue the statement
  on every applicable source and replica server, which enables
  you to verify immediate compliance.

  For additional `ALTER INSTANCE ROTATE BINLOG MASTER
  KEY` usage information, including what to do if the
  process does not complete correctly or is interrupted by an
  unexpected server halt, see
  [Section 19.3.2, “Encrypting Binary Log Files and Relay Log Files”](replication-binlog-encryption.md "19.3.2 Encrypting Binary Log Files and Relay Log Files").
- `ALTER INSTANCE RELOAD TLS`

  This action reconfigures a TLS context from the current values
  of the system variables that define the context. It also
  updates the status variables that reflect the active context
  values. This action requires the
  [`CONNECTION_ADMIN`](privileges-provided.md#priv_connection-admin) privilege. For
  additional information about reconfiguring the TLS context,
  including which system and status variables are
  context-related, see
  [Server-Side Runtime Configuration and Monitoring for Encrypted
  Connections](using-encrypted-connections.md#using-encrypted-connections-server-side-runtime-configuration "Server-Side Runtime Configuration and Monitoring for Encrypted Connections").

  By default, the statement reloads the TLS context for the main
  connection interface. If the `FOR CHANNEL`
  clause (available as of MySQL 8.0.21) is given, the statement
  reloads the TLS context for the named channel:
  `mysql_main` for the main connection
  interface, `mysql_admin` for the
  administrative connection interface. For information about the
  different interfaces, see
  [Section 7.1.12.1, “Connection Interfaces”](connection-interfaces.md "7.1.12.1 Connection Interfaces"). The updated TLS
  context properties are exposed in the Performance Schema
  [`tls_channel_status`](performance-schema-tls-channel-status-table.md "29.12.21.9 The tls_channel_status Table") table. See
  [Section 29.12.21.9, “The tls\_channel\_status Table”](performance-schema-tls-channel-status-table.md "29.12.21.9 The tls_channel_status Table").

  Updating the TLS context for the main interface may also
  affect the administrative interface because unless some
  nondefault TLS value is configured for that interface, it uses
  the same TLS context as the main interface.

  Note

  When you reload the TLS context, OpenSSL reloads the file
  containing the CRL (certificate revocation list) as part of
  the process. If the CRL file is large, the server allocates
  a large chunk of memory (ten times the file size), which is
  doubled while the new instance is being loaded and the old
  one has not yet been released. The process resident memory
  is not immediately reduced after a large allocation is
  freed, so if you issue the `ALTER INSTANCE RELOAD
  TLS` statement repeatedly with a large CRL file,
  the process resident memory usage may grow as a result of
  this.

  By default, the `RELOAD TLS` action rolls
  back with an error and has no effect if the configuration
  values do not permit creation of the new TLS context. The
  previous context values continue to be used for new
  connections. If the optional `NO ROLLBACK ON
  ERROR` clause is given and the new context cannot be
  created, rollback does not occur. Instead, a warning is
  generated and encryption is disabled for new connections on
  the interface to which the statement applies.

  `ALTER INSTANCE RELOAD TLS` statements are
  not written to the binary log (and thus are not replicated).
  TLS configuration is local and depends on local files not
  necessarily present on all servers involved.
- `ALTER INSTANCE RELOAD KEYRING`

  If a keyring component is installed, this action tells the
  component to re-read its configuration file and reinitialize
  any keyring in-memory data. If you modify the component
  configuration at runtime, the new configuration does not take
  effect until you perform this action. Keyring reloading
  requires the
  [`ENCRYPTION_KEY_ADMIN`](privileges-provided.md#priv_encryption-key-admin) privilege.
  This action was added in MySQL 8.0.24.

  This action enables reconfiguring only the currently installed
  keyring component. It does not enable changing which component
  is installed. For example, if you change the configuration for
  the installed keyring component, [`ALTER
  INSTANCE RELOAD KEYRING`](alter-instance.md#alter-instance-reload-keyring) causes the new configuration
  to take effect. On the other hand, if you change the keyring
  component named in the server manifest file,
  [`ALTER INSTANCE RELOAD KEYRING`](alter-instance.md#alter-instance-reload-keyring)
  has no effect and the current component remains installed.

  `ALTER INSTANCE RELOAD KEYRING` statements
  are not written to the binary log (and thus are not
  replicated).
