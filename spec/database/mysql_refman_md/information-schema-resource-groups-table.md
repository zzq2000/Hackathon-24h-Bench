### 28.3.26 The INFORMATION\_SCHEMA RESOURCE\_GROUPS Table

The [`RESOURCE_GROUPS`](information-schema-resource-groups-table.md "28.3.26 The INFORMATION_SCHEMA RESOURCE_GROUPS Table") table provides
access to information about resource groups. For general
discussion of the resource group capability, see
[Section 7.1.16, “Resource Groups”](resource-groups.md "7.1.16 Resource Groups").

You can see information only for columns for which you have some
privilege.

The [`RESOURCE_GROUPS`](information-schema-resource-groups-table.md "28.3.26 The INFORMATION_SCHEMA RESOURCE_GROUPS Table") table has these
columns:

- `RESOURCE_GROUP_NAME`

  The name of the resource group.
- `RESOURCE_GROUP_TYPE`

  The resource group type, either `SYSTEM` or
  `USER`.
- `RESOURCE_GROUP_ENABLED`

  Whether the resource group is enabled (1) or disabled (0);
- `VCPU_IDS`

  The CPU affinity; that is, the set of virtual CPUs that the
  resource group can use. The value is a list of comma-separated
  CPU numbers or ranges.
- `THREAD_PRIORITY`

  The priority for threads assigned to the resource group. The
  priority ranges from -20 (highest priority) to 19 (lowest
  priority). System resource groups have a priority that ranges
  from -20 to 0. User resource groups have a priority that
  ranges from 0 to 19.
