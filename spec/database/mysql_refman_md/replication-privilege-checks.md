### 19.3.3 Replication Privilege Checks

[19.3.3.1 Privileges For The Replication PRIVILEGE\_CHECKS\_USER Account](replication-privilege-checks-account.md)

[19.3.3.2 Privilege Checks For Group Replication Channels](replication-privilege-checks-gr.md)

[19.3.3.3 Recovering From Failed Replication Privilege Checks](replication-privilege-checks-recover.md)

By default, MySQL replication (including Group Replication) does
not carry out privilege checks when transactions that were already
accepted by another server are applied on a replica or group
member. From MySQL 8.0.18, you can create a user account with the
appropriate privileges to apply the transactions that are normally
replicated on a channel, and specify this as the
`PRIVILEGE_CHECKS_USER` account for the
replication applier, using a [`CHANGE
REPLICATION SOURCE TO`](change-replication-source-to.md "15.4.2.3 CHANGE REPLICATION SOURCE TO Statement") statement (from MySQL 8.0.23) or
[`CHANGE MASTER TO`](change-master-to.md "15.4.2.1 CHANGE MASTER TO Statement") statement (before
MySQL 8.0.23). MySQL then checks each transaction against the user
account's privileges to verify that you have authorized the
operation for that channel. The account can also be safely used by
an administrator to apply or reapply transactions from
[**mysqlbinlog**](mysqlbinlog.md "6.6.9 mysqlbinlog — Utility for Processing Binary Log Files") output, for example to recover from
a replication error on the channel.

The use of a `PRIVILEGE_CHECKS_USER` account
helps secure a replication channel against the unauthorized or
accidental use of privileged or unwanted operations. The
`PRIVILEGE_CHECKS_USER` account provides an
additional layer of security in situations such as these:

- You are replicating between a server instance on your
  organization's network, and a server instance on another
  network, such as an instance supplied by a cloud service
  provider.
- You want to have multiple on-premise or off-site deployments
  administered as separate units, without giving one
  administrator account privileges on all the deployments.
- You want to have an administrator account that enables an
  administrator to perform only operations that are directly
  relevant to the replication channel and the databases it
  replicates, rather than having wide privileges on the server
  instance.

You can increase the security of a replication channel where
privilege checks are applied by adding one or both of these
options to the [`CHANGE REPLICATION SOURCE
TO`](change-replication-source-to.md "15.4.2.3 CHANGE REPLICATION SOURCE TO Statement") | [`CHANGE MASTER TO`](change-master-to.md "15.4.2.1 CHANGE MASTER TO Statement")
statement when you specify the
`PRIVILEGE_CHECKS_USER` account for the channel:

- The `REQUIRE_ROW_FORMAT` option (available
  from MySQL 8.0.19) makes the replication channel accept only
  row-based replication events. When
  `REQUIRE_ROW_FORMAT` is set, you must use
  row-based binary logging
  ([`binlog_format=ROW`](replication-options-binary-log.md#sysvar_binlog_format)) on the
  source server. In MySQL 8.0.18,
  `REQUIRE_ROW_FORMAT` is not available, but
  the use of row-based binary logging for secured replication
  channels is still strongly recommended. With statement-based
  binary logging, some administrator-level privileges might be
  required for the `PRIVILEGE_CHECKS_USER`
  account to execute transactions successfully.
- The `REQUIRE_TABLE_PRIMARY_KEY_CHECK` option
  (available from MySQL 8.0.20) makes the replication channel
  use its own policy for primary key checks. Setting
  `ON` means that primary keys are always
  required, and setting `OFF` means that
  primary keys are never required. The default setting,
  `STREAM`, sets the session value of the
  [`sql_require_primary_key`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_sql_require_primary_key)
  system variable using the value that is replicated from the
  source for each transaction. When
  `PRIVILEGE_CHECKS_USER` is set, setting
  `REQUIRE_TABLE_PRIMARY_KEY_CHECK` to either
  `ON` or `OFF` means that the
  user account does not need session administration level
  privileges to set restricted session variables, which are
  required to change the value of
  [`sql_require_primary_key`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_sql_require_primary_key). It
  also normalizes the behavior across replication channels for
  different sources.

You grant the [`REPLICATION_APPLIER`](privileges-provided.md#priv_replication-applier)
privilege to enable a user account to appear as the
`PRIVILEGE_CHECKS_USER` for a replication applier
thread, and to execute the internal-use
[`BINLOG`](binlog.md "15.7.8.1 BINLOG Statement") statements used by
mysqlbinlog. The user name and host name for the
`PRIVILEGE_CHECKS_USER` account must follow the
syntax described in [Section 8.2.4, “Specifying Account Names”](account-names.md "8.2.4 Specifying Account Names"), and the user
must not be an anonymous user (with a blank user name) or the
`CURRENT_USER`. To create a new account, use
[`CREATE USER`](create-user.md "15.7.1.3 CREATE USER Statement"). To grant this account
the [`REPLICATION_APPLIER`](privileges-provided.md#priv_replication-applier) privilege,
use the [`GRANT`](grant.md "15.7.1.6 GRANT Statement") statement. For
example, to create a user account `priv_repl`,
which can be used manually by an administrator from any host in
the `example.com` domain, and requires an
encrypted connection, issue the following statements:

```sql
mysql> SET sql_log_bin = 0;
mysql> CREATE USER 'priv_repl'@'%.example.com' IDENTIFIED BY 'password' REQUIRE SSL;
mysql> GRANT REPLICATION_APPLIER ON *.* TO 'priv_repl'@'%.example.com';
mysql> SET sql_log_bin = 1;
```

The `SET sql_log_bin` statements are used so that
the account management statements are not added to the binary log
and sent to the replication channels (see
[Section 15.4.1.3, “SET sql\_log\_bin Statement”](set-sql-log-bin.md "15.4.1.3 SET sql_log_bin Statement")).

Important

The `caching_sha2_password` authentication
plugin is the default for new users created from MySQL 8.0 (for
details, see
[Section 8.4.1.2, “Caching SHA-2 Pluggable Authentication”](caching-sha2-pluggable-authentication.md "8.4.1.2 Caching SHA-2 Pluggable Authentication")). To
connect to a server using a user account that authenticates with
this plugin, you must either set up an encrypted connection as
described in
[Section 19.3.1, “Setting Up Replication to Use Encrypted Connections”](replication-encrypted-connections.md "19.3.1 Setting Up Replication to Use Encrypted Connections"), or enable
the unencrypted connection to support password exchange using an
RSA key pair.

After setting up the user account, use the
[`GRANT`](grant.md "15.7.1.6 GRANT Statement") statement to grant additional
privileges to enable the user account to make the database changes
that you expect the applier thread to carry out, such as updating
specific tables held on the server. These same privileges enable
an administrator to use the account if they need to execute any of
those transactions manually on the replication channel. If an
unexpected operation is attempted for which you did not grant the
appropriate privileges, the operation is disallowed and the
replication applier thread stops with an error.
[Section 19.3.3.1, “Privileges For The Replication PRIVILEGE\_CHECKS\_USER Account”](replication-privilege-checks-account.md "19.3.3.1 Privileges For The Replication PRIVILEGE_CHECKS_USER Account") explains
what additional privileges the account needs. For example, to
grant the `priv_repl` user account the
[`INSERT`](privileges-provided.md#priv_insert) privilege to add rows to the
`cust` table in `db1`, issue the
following statement:

```sql
mysql> GRANT INSERT ON db1.cust TO 'priv_repl'@'%.example.com';
```

You assign the `PRIVILEGE_CHECKS_USER` account
for a replication channel using a [`CHANGE
REPLICATION SOURCE TO`](change-replication-source-to.md "15.4.2.3 CHANGE REPLICATION SOURCE TO Statement") statement (from MySQL 8.0.23) or
[`CHANGE MASTER TO`](change-master-to.md "15.4.2.1 CHANGE MASTER TO Statement") statement (before
MySQL 8.0.23). If replication is running, issue
[`STOP REPLICA`](stop-replica.md "15.4.2.8 STOP REPLICA Statement") (or before MySQL
8.0.22, [`STOP SLAVE`](stop-slave.md "15.4.2.9 STOP SLAVE Statement")) before the
[`CHANGE MASTER TO`](change-master-to.md "15.4.2.1 CHANGE MASTER TO Statement") statement, and
[`START REPLICA`](start-replica.md "15.4.2.6 START REPLICA Statement") after it. The use of
row-based binary logging is strongly recommended when
`PRIVILEGE_CHECKS_USER` is set, and from MySQL
8.0.19 you can use the statement to set
`REQUIRE_ROW_FORMAT` to enforce this.

When you restart the replication channel, checks on dynamic
privileges are applied from that point on. However, static global
privileges are not active in the applier's context until you
reload the grant tables, because these privileges are not changed
for a connected client. To activate static privileges, perform a
flush-privileges operation. This can be done by issuing a
[`FLUSH PRIVILEGES`](flush.md#flush-privileges) statement or by
executing a [**mysqladmin flush-privileges**](mysqladmin.md "6.5.2 mysqladmin — A MySQL Server Administration Program") or
[**mysqladmin reload**](mysqladmin.md "6.5.2 mysqladmin — A MySQL Server Administration Program") command.

For example, to start privilege checks on the channel
`channel_1` on a running replica in MySQL 8.0.23
and later, issue the following statements:

```sql
mysql> STOP REPLICA FOR CHANNEL 'channel_1';
mysql> CHANGE REPLICATION SOURCE TO
     >    PRIVILEGE_CHECKS_USER = 'priv_repl'@'%.example.com',
     >    REQUIRE_ROW_FORMAT = 1 FOR CHANNEL 'channel_1';
mysql> FLUSH PRIVILEGES;
mysql> START REPLICA FOR CHANNEL 'channel_1';
```

Prior to MySQL 8.0.23, you can use the statements shown here:

```sql
mysql> STOP SLAVE FOR CHANNEL 'channel_1';
mysql> CHANGE MASTER TO
     >    PRIVILEGE_CHECKS_USER = 'priv_repl'@'%.example.com',
     >    REQUIRE_ROW_FORMAT = 1 FOR CHANNEL 'channel_1';
mysql> FLUSH PRIVILEGES;
mysql> START SLAVE FOR CHANNEL 'channel_1';
```

If you do not specify a channel and no other channels exist, the
statement is applied to the default channel. The user name and
host name for the `PRIVILEGE_CHECKS_USER` account
for a channel are shown in the Performance Schema
[`replication_applier_configuration`](performance-schema-replication-applier-configuration-table.md "29.12.11.2 The replication_applier_configuration Table")
table, where they are properly escaped so they can be copied
directly into SQL statements to execute individual transactions.

In MySQL 8.0.31 and later, if you are using the
`Rewriter` plugin, you should grant the
`PRIVILEGE_CHECKS_USER` user account the
[`SKIP_QUERY_REWRITE`](privileges-provided.md#priv_skip-query-rewrite) privilege. This
prevents statements issued by this user from being rewritten. See
[Section 7.6.4, “The Rewriter Query Rewrite Plugin”](rewriter-query-rewrite-plugin.md "7.6.4 The Rewriter Query Rewrite Plugin"), for more
information.

When `REQUIRE_ROW_FORMAT` is set for a
replication channel, the replication applier does not create or
drop temporary tables, and so does not set the
[`pseudo_thread_id`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_pseudo_thread_id) session system
variable. It does not execute `LOAD DATA INFILE`
instructions, and so does not attempt file operations to access or
delete the temporary files associated with data loads (logged as a
`Format_description_log_event`). It does not
execute `INTVAR`, `RAND`, and
`USER_VAR` events, which are used to reproduce
the client's connection state for statement-based replication. (An
exception is `USER_VAR` events that are
associated with DDL queries, which are executed.) It does not
execute any statements that are logged within DML transactions. If
the replication applier detects any of these types of event while
attempting to queue or apply a transaction, the event is not
applied, and replication stops with an error.

You can set `REQUIRE_ROW_FORMAT` for a
replication channel whether or not you set a
`PRIVILEGE_CHECKS_USER` account. The restrictions
implemented when you set this option increase the security of the
replication channel even without privilege checks. You can also
specify the `--require-row-format` option when you
use [**mysqlbinlog**](mysqlbinlog.md "6.6.9 mysqlbinlog — Utility for Processing Binary Log Files"), to enforce row-based
replication events in [**mysqlbinlog**](mysqlbinlog.md "6.6.9 mysqlbinlog — Utility for Processing Binary Log Files") output.

**Security Context.**
By default, when a replication applier thread is started with a
user account specified as the
`PRIVILEGE_CHECKS_USER`, the security context
is created using default roles, or with all roles if
[`activate_all_roles_on_login`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_activate_all_roles_on_login) is
set to `ON`.

You can use roles to supply a general privilege set to accounts
that are used as `PRIVILEGE_CHECKS_USER`
accounts, as in the following example. Here, instead of granting
the [`INSERT`](privileges-provided.md#priv_insert) privilege for the
`db1.cust` table directly to a user account as in
the earlier example, this privilege is granted to the role
`priv_repl_role` along with the
[`REPLICATION_APPLIER`](privileges-provided.md#priv_replication-applier) privilege. The
role is then used to grant the privilege set to two user accounts,
both of which can now be used as
`PRIVILEGE_CHECKS_USER` accounts:

```sql
mysql> SET sql_log_bin = 0;
mysql> CREATE USER 'priv_repa'@'%.example.com'
                  IDENTIFIED BY 'password'
                  REQUIRE SSL;
mysql> CREATE USER 'priv_repb'@'%.example.com'
                  IDENTIFIED BY 'password'
                  REQUIRE SSL;
mysql> CREATE ROLE 'priv_repl_role';
mysql> GRANT REPLICATION_APPLIER TO 'priv_repl_role';
mysql> GRANT INSERT ON db1.cust TO 'priv_repl_role';
mysql> GRANT 'priv_repl_role' TO
                  'priv_repa'@'%.example.com',
                  'priv_repb'@'%.example.com';
mysql> SET DEFAULT ROLE 'priv_repl_role' TO
                  'priv_repa'@'%.example.com',
                  'priv_repb'@'%.example.com';
mysql> SET sql_log_bin = 1;
```

Be aware that when the replication applier thread creates the
security context, it checks the privileges for the
`PRIVILEGE_CHECKS_USER` account, but does not
carry out password validation, and does not carry out checks
relating to account management, such as checking whether the
account is locked. The security context that is created remains
unchanged for the lifetime of the replication applier thread.

**Limitation.**
In MySQL 8.0.18 only, if the replica [**mysqld**](mysqld.md "6.3.1 mysqld — The MySQL Server")
is restarted immediately after issuing a
[`RESET REPLICA`](reset-replica.md "15.4.2.4 RESET REPLICA Statement") statement (due to
an unexpected server exit or deliberate restart), the
`PRIVILEGE_CHECKS_USER` account setting, which
is held in the `mysql.slave_relay_log_info`
table, is lost and must be respecified. When you use privilege
checks in that release, always verify that they are in place
after a restart, and respecify them if required. From MySQL
8.0.19, the `PRIVILEGE_CHECKS_USER` account
setting is preserved in this situation, so it is retrieved from
the table and reapplied to the channel.
