#### 19.1.3.1 GTID Format and Storage

A global transaction identifier (GTID) is a unique identifier
created and associated with each transaction committed on the
server of origin (the source). This identifier is unique not only
to the server on which it originated, but is unique across all
servers in a given replication topology.

GTID assignment distinguishes between client transactions, which
are committed on the source, and replicated transactions, which
are reproduced on a replica. When a client transaction is
committed on the source, it is assigned a new GTID, provided that
the transaction was written to the binary log. Client transactions
are guaranteed to have monotonically increasing GTIDs without gaps
between the generated numbers. If a client transaction is not
written to the binary log (for example, because the transaction
was filtered out, or the transaction was read-only), it is not
assigned a GTID on the server of origin.

Replicated transactions retain the same GTID that was assigned to
the transaction on the server of origin. The GTID is present
before the replicated transaction begins to execute, and is
persisted even if the replicated transaction is not written to the
binary log on the replica, or is filtered out on the replica. The
MySQL system table `mysql.gtid_executed` is used
to preserve the assigned GTIDs of all the transactions applied on
a MySQL server, except those that are stored in a currently active
binary log file.

The auto-skip function for GTIDs means that a transaction
committed on the source can be applied no more than once on the
replica, which helps to guarantee consistency. Once a transaction
with a given GTID has been committed on a given server, any
attempt to execute a subsequent transaction with the same GTID is
ignored by that server. No error is raised, and no statement in
the transaction is executed.

If a transaction with a given GTID has started to execute on a
server, but has not yet committed or rolled back, any attempt to
start a concurrent transaction on the server with the same GTID
blocks. The server neither begins to execute the concurrent
transaction nor returns control to the client. Once the first
attempt at the transaction commits or rolls back, concurrent
sessions that were blocking on the same GTID may proceed. If the
first attempt rolled back, one concurrent session proceeds to
attempt the transaction, and any other concurrent sessions that
were blocking on the same GTID remain blocked. If the first
attempt committed, all the concurrent sessions stop being blocked,
and auto-skip all the statements of the transaction.

A GTID is represented as a pair of coordinates, separated by a
colon character (`:`), as shown here:

```ini
GTID = source_id:transaction_id
```

The *`source_id`* identifies the
originating server. Normally, the source's
[`server_uuid`](replication-options.md#sysvar_server_uuid) is used for this
purpose. The *`transaction_id`* is a
sequence number determined by the order in which the transaction
was committed on the source. For example, the first transaction to
be committed has `1` as its
*`transaction_id`*, and the tenth
transaction to be committed on the same originating server is
assigned a *`transaction_id`* of
`10`. It is not possible for a transaction to
have `0` as a sequence number in a GTID. For
example, the twenty-third transaction to be committed originally
on the server with the UUID
`3E11FA47-71CA-11E1-9E33-C80AA9429562` has this
GTID:

```none
3E11FA47-71CA-11E1-9E33-C80AA9429562:23
```

The upper limit for sequence numbers for GTIDs on a server
instance is the number of non-negative values for a signed 64-bit
integer (2 to the power of 63 minus 1, or
9,223,372,036,854,775,807). If the server runs out of GTIDs, it
takes the action specified by
[`binlog_error_action`](replication-options-binary-log.md#sysvar_binlog_error_action). From MySQL
8.0.23, a warning message is issued when the server instance is
approaching the limit.

The GTID for a transaction is shown in the output from
[**mysqlbinlog**](mysqlbinlog.md "6.6.9 mysqlbinlog — Utility for Processing Binary Log Files"), and it is used to identify an
individual transaction in the Performance Schema replication
status tables, for example,
[`replication_applier_status_by_worker`](performance-schema-replication-applier-status-by-worker-table.md "29.12.11.5 The replication_applier_status_by_worker Table").
The value stored by the [`gtid_next`](replication-options-gtids.md#sysvar_gtid_next)
system variable (`@@GLOBAL.gtid_next`) is a
single GTID.

##### GTID Sets

A GTID set is a set comprising one or more single GTIDs or
ranges of GTIDs. GTID sets are used in a MySQL server in several
ways. For example, the values stored by the
[`gtid_executed`](replication-options-gtids.md#sysvar_gtid_executed) and
[`gtid_purged`](replication-options-gtids.md#sysvar_gtid_purged) system variables
are GTID sets. The [`START REPLICA`](start-replica.md "15.4.2.6 START REPLICA Statement")
(or before MySQL 8.0.22, [`START
SLAVE`](start-slave.md "15.4.2.7 START SLAVE Statement")) clauses `UNTIL
SQL_BEFORE_GTIDS` and `UNTIL
SQL_AFTER_GTIDS` can be used to make a replica process
transactions only up to the first GTID in a GTID set, or stop
after the last GTID in a GTID set. The built-in functions
[`GTID_SUBSET()`](gtid-functions.md#function_gtid-subset) and
[`GTID_SUBTRACT()`](gtid-functions.md#function_gtid-subtract) require GTID sets
as input.

A range of GTIDs originating from the same server can be
collapsed into a single expression, as shown here:

```none
3E11FA47-71CA-11E1-9E33-C80AA9429562:1-5
```

The above example represents the first through fifth
transactions originating on the MySQL server whose
[`server_uuid`](replication-options.md#sysvar_server_uuid) is
`3E11FA47-71CA-11E1-9E33-C80AA9429562`.
Multiple single GTIDs or ranges of GTIDs originating from the
same server can also be included in a single expression, with
the GTIDs or ranges separated by colons, as in the following
example:

```none
3E11FA47-71CA-11E1-9E33-C80AA9429562:1-3:11:47-49
```

A GTID set can include any combination of single GTIDs and
ranges of GTIDs, and it can include GTIDs originating from
different servers. This example shows the GTID set stored in the
[`gtid_executed`](replication-options-gtids.md#sysvar_gtid_executed) system variable
(`@@GLOBAL.gtid_executed`) of a replica that
has applied transactions from more than one source:

```none
2174B383-5441-11E8-B90A-C80AA9429562:1-3, 24DA167-0C0C-11E8-8442-00059A3C7B00:1-19
```

When GTID sets are returned from server variables, UUIDs are in
alphabetical order, and numeric intervals are merged and in
ascending order.

The syntax for a GTID set is as follows:

```sql
gtid_set:
    uuid_set [, uuid_set] ...
    | ''

uuid_set:
    uuid:interval[:interval]...

uuid:
    hhhhhhhh-hhhh-hhhh-hhhh-hhhhhhhhhhhh

h:
    [0-9|A-F]

interval:
    n[-n]

    (n >= 1)
```

##### mysql.gtid\_executed Table

GTIDs are stored in a table named
`gtid_executed`, in the
`mysql` database. A row in this table contains,
for each GTID or set of GTIDs that it represents, the UUID of
the originating server, and the starting and ending transaction
IDs of the set; for a row referencing only a single GTID, these
last two values are the same.

The `mysql.gtid_executed` table is created (if
it does not already exist) when MySQL Server is installed or
upgraded, using a [`CREATE TABLE`](create-table.md "15.1.20 CREATE TABLE Statement")
statement similar to that shown here:

```sql
CREATE TABLE gtid_executed (
    source_uuid CHAR(36) NOT NULL,
    interval_start BIGINT(20) NOT NULL,
    interval_end BIGINT(20) NOT NULL,
    PRIMARY KEY (source_uuid, interval_start)
)
```

Warning

As with other MySQL system tables, do not attempt to create or
modify this table yourself.

The `mysql.gtid_executed` table is provided for
internal use by the MySQL server. It enables a replica to use
GTIDs when binary logging is disabled on the replica, and it
enables retention of the GTID state when the binary logs have
been lost. Note that the `mysql.gtid_executed`
table is cleared if you issue [`RESET
MASTER`](reset-master.md "15.4.1.2 RESET MASTER Statement").

GTIDs are stored in the `mysql.gtid_executed`
table only when [`gtid_mode`](replication-options-gtids.md#sysvar_gtid_mode) is
`ON` or `ON_PERMISSIVE`. If
binary logging is disabled (`log_bin` is
`OFF`), or if
[`log_replica_updates`](replication-options-binary-log.md#sysvar_log_replica_updates) or
[`log_slave_updates`](replication-options-binary-log.md#sysvar_log_slave_updates) is disabled,
the server stores the GTID belonging to each transaction
together with the transaction in the buffer when the transaction
is committed, and the background thread adds the contents of the
buffer periodically as one or more entries to the
`mysql.gtid_executed` table. In addition, the
table is compressed periodically at a user-configurable rate, as
described in
[mysql.gtid\_executed Table Compression](replication-gtids-concepts.md#replication-gtids-gtid-executed-table-compression "mysql.gtid_executed Table Compression").

If binary logging is enabled (`log_bin` is
`ON`), from MySQL 8.0.17 for the
`InnoDB` storage engine only, the server
updates the `mysql.gtid_executed` table in the
same way as when binary logging or replica update logging is
disabled, storing the GTID for each transaction at transaction
commit time. However, in releases before MySQL 8.0.17, and for
other storage engines, the server only updates the
`mysql.gtid_executed` table when the binary log
is rotated or the server is shut down. At these times, the
server writes GTIDs for all transactions that were written into
the previous binary log into the
`mysql.gtid_executed` table. This situation
applies on a source prior to MySQL 8.0.17, or on a replica prior
to MySQL 8.0.17 where binary logging is enabled, or with storage
engines other than `InnoDB`, it has the
following consequences:

- In the event of the server stopping unexpectedly, the set of
  GTIDs from the current binary log file is not saved in the
  `mysql.gtid_executed` table. These GTIDs
  are added to the table from the binary log file during
  recovery so that replication can continue. The exception to
  this is if you disable binary logging when the server is
  restarted (using
  [`--skip-log-bin`](replication-options-binary-log.md#option_mysqld_log-bin)
  or
  [`--disable-log-bin`](replication-options-binary-log.md#option_mysqld_log-bin)).
  In that case, the server cannot access the binary log file
  to recover the GTIDs, so replication cannot be started.
- The `mysql.gtid_executed` table does not
  hold a complete record of the GTIDs for all executed
  transactions. That information is provided by the global
  value of the [`gtid_executed`](replication-options-gtids.md#sysvar_gtid_executed)
  system variable. In releases before MySQL 8.0.17 and with
  storage engines other than `InnoDB`, always
  use `@@GLOBAL.gtid_executed`, which is
  updated after every commit, to represent the GTID state for
  the MySQL server, instead of querying the
  `mysql.gtid_executed` table.

The MySQL server can write to the
`mysql.gtid_executed` table even when the
server is in read only or super read only mode. In releases
before MySQL 8.0.17, this ensures that the binary log file can
still be rotated in these modes. If the
`mysql.gtid_executed` table cannot be accessed
for writes, and the binary log file is rotated for any reason
other than reaching the maximum file size
([`max_binlog_size`](replication-options-binary-log.md#sysvar_max_binlog_size)), the current
binary log file continues to be used. An error message is
returned to the client that requested the rotation, and a
warning is logged on the server. If the
`mysql.gtid_executed` table cannot be accessed
for writes and [`max_binlog_size`](replication-options-binary-log.md#sysvar_max_binlog_size)
is reached, the server responds according to its
[`binlog_error_action`](replication-options-binary-log.md#sysvar_binlog_error_action) setting. If
`IGNORE_ERROR` is set, an error is logged on
the server and binary logging is halted, or if
`ABORT_SERVER` is set, the server shuts down.

##### mysql.gtid\_executed Table Compression

Over the course of time, the
`mysql.gtid_executed` table can become filled
with many rows referring to individual GTIDs that originate on
the same server, and whose transaction IDs make up a range,
similar to what is shown here:

```sql
+--------------------------------------+----------------+--------------+
| source_uuid                          | interval_start | interval_end |
|--------------------------------------+----------------+--------------|
| 3E11FA47-71CA-11E1-9E33-C80AA9429562 | 37             | 37           |
| 3E11FA47-71CA-11E1-9E33-C80AA9429562 | 38             | 38           |
| 3E11FA47-71CA-11E1-9E33-C80AA9429562 | 39             | 39           |
| 3E11FA47-71CA-11E1-9E33-C80AA9429562 | 40             | 40           |
| 3E11FA47-71CA-11E1-9E33-C80AA9429562 | 41             | 41           |
| 3E11FA47-71CA-11E1-9E33-C80AA9429562 | 42             | 42           |
| 3E11FA47-71CA-11E1-9E33-C80AA9429562 | 43             | 43           |
...
```

To save space, the MySQL server can compress the
`mysql.gtid_executed` table periodically by
replacing each such set of rows with a single row that spans the
entire interval of transaction identifiers, like this:

```none
+--------------------------------------+----------------+--------------+
| source_uuid                          | interval_start | interval_end |
|--------------------------------------+----------------+--------------|
| 3E11FA47-71CA-11E1-9E33-C80AA9429562 | 37             | 43           |
...
```

The server can carry out compression using a dedicated
foreground thread named
`thread/sql/compress_gtid_table`. This thread
is not listed in the output of [`SHOW
PROCESSLIST`](show-processlist.md "15.7.7.29 SHOW PROCESSLIST Statement"), but it can be viewed as a row in the
[`threads`](performance-schema-threads-table.md "29.12.21.8 The threads Table") table, as shown here:

```sql
mysql> SELECT * FROM performance_schema.threads WHERE NAME LIKE '%gtid%'\G
*************************** 1. row ***************************
          THREAD_ID: 26
               NAME: thread/sql/compress_gtid_table
               TYPE: FOREGROUND
     PROCESSLIST_ID: 1
   PROCESSLIST_USER: NULL
   PROCESSLIST_HOST: NULL
     PROCESSLIST_DB: NULL
PROCESSLIST_COMMAND: Daemon
   PROCESSLIST_TIME: 1509
  PROCESSLIST_STATE: Suspending
   PROCESSLIST_INFO: NULL
   PARENT_THREAD_ID: 1
               ROLE: NULL
       INSTRUMENTED: YES
            HISTORY: YES
    CONNECTION_TYPE: NULL
       THREAD_OS_ID: 18677
```

When binary logging is enabled on the server, this compression
method is not used, and instead the
`mysql.gtid_executed` table is compressed on
each binary log rotation. However, when binary logging is
disabled on the server, the
`thread/sql/compress_gtid_table` thread sleeps
until a specified number of transactions have been executed,
then wakes up to perform compression of the
`mysql.gtid_executed` table. It then sleeps
until the same number of transactions have taken place, then
wakes up to perform the compression again, repeating this loop
indefinitely. The number of transactions that elapse before the
table is compressed, and thus the compression rate, is
controlled by the value of the
[`gtid_executed_compression_period`](replication-options-gtids.md#sysvar_gtid_executed_compression_period)
system variable. Setting that value to 0 means that the thread
never wakes up, meaning that this explicit compression method is
not used. Instead, compression occurs implicitly as required.

From MySQL 8.0.17, [`InnoDB`](innodb-storage-engine.md "Chapter 17 The InnoDB Storage Engine")
transactions are written to the
`mysql.gtid_executed` table by a separate
process to non-`InnoDB` transactions. This
process is controlled by a different thread,
`innodb/clone_gtid_thread`. This GTID persister
thread collects GTIDs in groups, flushes them to the
`mysql.gtid_executed` table, then compresses
the table. If the server has a mix of
[`InnoDB`](innodb-storage-engine.md "Chapter 17 The InnoDB Storage Engine") transactions and
non-[`InnoDB`](innodb-storage-engine.md "Chapter 17 The InnoDB Storage Engine") transactions, which are
written to the `mysql.gtid_executed` table
individually, the compression carried out by the
`compress_gtid_table` thread interferes with
the work of the GTID persister thread and can slow it
significantly. For this reason, from that release it is
recommended that you set
[`gtid_executed_compression_period`](replication-options-gtids.md#sysvar_gtid_executed_compression_period)
to 0, so that the `compress_gtid_table` thread
is never activated.

From MySQL 8.0.23, the
[`gtid_executed_compression_period`](replication-options-gtids.md#sysvar_gtid_executed_compression_period)
default value is 0, and both `InnoDB` and
non-`InnoDB` transactions are written to the
`mysql.gtid_executed` table by the GTID
persister thread.

For releases before MySQL 8.0.17, the default value of 1000 for
[`gtid_executed_compression_period`](replication-options-gtids.md#sysvar_gtid_executed_compression_period)
can be used, meaning that compression of the table is performed
after each 1000 transactions, or you can choose an alternative
value. In those releases, if you set a value of 0 and binary
logging is disabled, explicit compression is not performed on
the `mysql.gtid_executed` table, and you should
be prepared for a potentially large increase in the amount of
disk space that may be required by the table if you do this.

When a server instance is started, if
[`gtid_executed_compression_period`](replication-options-gtids.md#sysvar_gtid_executed_compression_period)
is set to a nonzero value and the
`thread/sql/compress_gtid_table` thread is
launched, in most server configurations, explicit compression is
performed for the `mysql.gtid_executed` table.
In releases before MySQL 8.0.17 when binary logging is enabled,
compression is triggered by the fact of the binary log being
rotated at startup. In releases from MySQL 8.0.20, compression
is triggered by the thread launch. In the intervening releases,
compression does not take place at startup.
