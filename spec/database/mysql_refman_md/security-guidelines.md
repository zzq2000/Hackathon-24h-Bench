### 8.1.1 Security Guidelines

Anyone using MySQL on a computer connected to the Internet should
read this section to avoid the most common security mistakes.

In discussing security, it is necessary to consider fully
protecting the entire server host (not just the MySQL server)
against all types of applicable attacks: eavesdropping, altering,
playback, and denial of service. We do not cover all aspects of
availability and fault tolerance here.

MySQL uses security based on Access Control Lists (ACLs) for all
connections, queries, and other operations that users can attempt
to perform. There is also support for SSL-encrypted connections
between MySQL clients and servers. Many of the concepts discussed
here are not specific to MySQL at all; the same general ideas
apply to almost all applications.

When running MySQL, follow these guidelines:

- **Do not ever give anyone (except MySQL
  `root` accounts) access to the
  `user` table in the `mysql`
  system database!** This is critical.
- Learn how the MySQL access privilege system works (see
  [Section 8.2, “Access Control and Account Management”](access-control.md "8.2 Access Control and Account Management")). Use the
  [`GRANT`](grant.md "15.7.1.6 GRANT Statement") and
  [`REVOKE`](revoke.md "15.7.1.8 REVOKE Statement") statements to control
  access to MySQL. Do not grant more privileges than necessary.
  Never grant privileges to all hosts.

  Checklist:

  - Try `mysql -u root`. If you are able to
    connect successfully to the server without being asked for
    a password, anyone can connect to your MySQL server as the
    MySQL `root` user with full privileges!
    Review the MySQL installation instructions, paying
    particular attention to the information about setting a
    `root` password. See
    [Section 2.9.4, “Securing the Initial MySQL Account”](default-privileges.md "2.9.4 Securing the Initial MySQL Account").
  - Use the [`SHOW GRANTS`](show-grants.md "15.7.7.21 SHOW GRANTS Statement")
    statement to check which accounts have access to what.
    Then use the [`REVOKE`](revoke.md "15.7.1.8 REVOKE Statement")
    statement to remove those privileges that are not
    necessary.
- Do not store cleartext passwords in your database. If your
  computer becomes compromised, the intruder can take the full
  list of passwords and use them. Instead, use
  [`SHA2()`](encryption-functions.md#function_sha2) or some other one-way
  hashing function and store the hash value.

  To prevent password recovery using rainbow tables, do not use
  these functions on a plain password; instead, choose some
  string to be used as a salt, and use hash(hash(password)+salt)
  values.
- Assume that all passwords will be subject to automated
  cracking attempts using lists of known passwords, and also to
  targeted guessing using publicly available information about
  you, such as social media posts. Do not choose passwords that
  consist of easily cracked or guessed items such as a
  dictionary word, proper name, sports team name, acronym, or
  commonly known phrase, particularly if they are relevant to
  you. The use of upper case letters, number substitutions and
  additions, and special characters does not help if these are
  used in predictable ways. Also do not choose any password you
  have seen used as an example anywhere, or a variation on it,
  even if it was presented as an example of a strong password.

  Instead, choose passwords that are as long and as
  unpredictable as possible. That does not mean the combination
  needs to be a random string of characters that is difficult to
  remember and reproduce, although this is a good approach if
  you have, for example, password manager software that can
  generate and fill such passwords and store them securely. A
  passphrase containing multiple words is easy to create,
  remember, and reproduce, and is much more secure than a
  typical user-selected password consisting of a single modified
  word or a predictable sequence of characters. To create a
  secure passphrase, ensure that the words and other items in it
  are not a known phrase or quotation, do not occur in a
  predictable order, and preferably have no previous
  relationship to each other at all.
- Invest in a firewall. This protects you from at least 50% of
  all types of exploits in any software. Put MySQL behind the
  firewall or in a demilitarized zone (DMZ).

  Checklist:

  - Try to scan your ports from the Internet using a tool such
    as `nmap`. MySQL uses port 3306 by
    default. This port should not be accessible from untrusted
    hosts. As a simple way to check whether your MySQL port is
    open, try the following command from some remote machine,
    where *`server_host`* is the host
    name or IP address of the host on which your MySQL server
    runs:

    ```terminal
    $> telnet server_host 3306
    ```

    If **telnet** hangs or the connection is
    refused, the port is blocked, which is how you want it to
    be. If you get a connection and some garbage characters,
    the port is open, and should be closed on your firewall or
    router, unless you really have a good reason to keep it
    open.
- Applications that access MySQL should not trust any data
  entered by users, and should be written using proper defensive
  programming techniques. See
  [Section 8.1.7, “Client Programming Security Guidelines”](secure-client-programming.md "8.1.7 Client Programming Security Guidelines").
- Do not transmit plain (unencrypted) data over the Internet.
  This information is accessible to everyone who has the time
  and ability to intercept it and use it for their own purposes.
  Instead, use an encrypted protocol such as SSL or SSH. MySQL
  supports internal SSL connections. Another technique is to use
  SSH port-forwarding to create an encrypted (and compressed)
  tunnel for the communication.
- Learn to use the **tcpdump** and
  **strings** utilities. In most cases, you can
  check whether MySQL data streams are unencrypted by issuing a
  command like the following:

  ```terminal
  $> tcpdump -l -i eth0 -w - src or dst port 3306 | strings
  ```

  This works under Linux and should work with small
  modifications under other systems.

  Warning

  If you do not see cleartext data, this does not always mean
  that the information actually is encrypted. If you need high
  security, consult with a security expert.
