#### B.3.2.11 Can't create/write to file

If you get an error of the following type for some queries, it
means that MySQL cannot create a temporary file for the result
set in the temporary directory:

```none
Can't create/write to file '\\sqla3fe_0.ism'.
```

The preceding error is a typical message for Windows; the Unix
message is similar.

One fix is to start [**mysqld**](mysqld.md "6.3.1 mysqld — The MySQL Server") with the
[`--tmpdir`](server-options.md#option_mysqld_tmpdir) option or to add the
option to the `[mysqld]` section of your
option file. For example, to specify a directory of
`C:\temp`, use these lines:

```ini
[mysqld]
tmpdir=C:/temp
```

The `C:\temp` directory must exist and have
sufficient space for the MySQL server to write to. See
[Section 6.2.2.2, “Using Option Files”](option-files.md "6.2.2.2 Using Option Files").

Another cause of this error can be permissions issues. Make
sure that the MySQL server can write to the
[`tmpdir`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_tmpdir) directory.

Check also the error code that you get with
[**perror**](perror.md "6.8.2 perror — Display MySQL Error Message Information"). One reason the server cannot write
to a table is that the file system is full:

```terminal
$> perror 28
OS error code  28:  No space left on device
```

If you get an error of the following type during startup, it
indicates that the file system or directory used for storing
data files is write protected. Provided that the write error
is to a test file, the error is not serious and can be safely
ignored.

```none
Can't create test file /usr/local/mysql/data/master.lower-test
```
