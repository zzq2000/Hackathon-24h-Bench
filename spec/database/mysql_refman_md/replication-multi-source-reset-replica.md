#### 19.1.5.7 Resetting Multi-Source Replicas

The [`RESET REPLICA`](reset-replica.md "15.4.2.4 RESET REPLICA Statement") statement can be
used to reset a multi-source replica. By default, if you use the
[`RESET REPLICA`](reset-replica.md "15.4.2.4 RESET REPLICA Statement") statement on a
multi-source replica all channels are reset. Optionally, use the
`FOR CHANNEL channel`
clause to reset only a specific channel.

- To reset all currently configured replication channels:

  ```sql
  mysql> RESET SLAVE;
  Or from MySQL 8.0.22:
  mysql> RESET REPLICA;
  ```
- To reset only a named channel, use a `FOR CHANNEL
  channel` clause:

  ```sql
  mysql> RESET SLAVE FOR CHANNEL "source_1";
  Or from MySQL 8.0.22:
  mysql> RESET REPLICA FOR CHANNEL "source_1";
  ```

For GTID-based replication, note that [`RESET
REPLICA`](reset-replica.md "15.4.2.4 RESET REPLICA Statement") has no effect on the replica's GTID execution
history. If you want to clear this, issue
[`RESET MASTER`](reset-master.md "15.4.1.2 RESET MASTER Statement") on the replica.

[`RESET REPLICA`](reset-replica.md "15.4.2.4 RESET REPLICA Statement") makes the replica
forget its replication position, and clears the relay log, but it
does not change any replication connection parameters (such as the
source host name) or replication filters. If you want to remove
these for a channel, issue
[`RESET REPLICA
ALL`](reset-replica.md "15.4.2.4 RESET REPLICA Statement").

For the full syntax of the `RESET REPLICA`
command and other available options, see
[Section 15.4.2.4, “RESET REPLICA Statement”](reset-replica.md "15.4.2.4 RESET REPLICA Statement").
