### 27.4.2 Event Scheduler Configuration

Events are executed by a special event
scheduler thread; when we refer to the Event Scheduler,
we actually refer to this thread. When running, the event
scheduler thread and its current state can be seen by users having
the [`PROCESS`](privileges-provided.md#priv_process) privilege in the output
of [`SHOW PROCESSLIST`](show-processlist.md "15.7.7.29 SHOW PROCESSLIST Statement"), as shown in
the discussion that follows.

The global [`event_scheduler`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_event_scheduler) system
variable determines whether the Event Scheduler is enabled and
running on the server. It has one of the following values, which
affect event scheduling as described:

- `ON`: The Event Scheduler is started; the
  event scheduler thread runs and executes all scheduled events.
  `ON` is the default
  [`event_scheduler`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_event_scheduler) value.

  When the Event Scheduler is `ON`, the event
  scheduler thread is listed in the output of
  [`SHOW PROCESSLIST`](show-processlist.md "15.7.7.29 SHOW PROCESSLIST Statement") as a daemon
  process, and its state is represented as shown here:

  ```sql
  mysql> SHOW PROCESSLIST\G
  *************************** 1. row ***************************
       Id: 1
     User: root
     Host: localhost
       db: NULL
  Command: Query
     Time: 0
    State: NULL
     Info: show processlist
  *************************** 2. row ***************************
       Id: 2
     User: event_scheduler
     Host: localhost
       db: NULL
  Command: Daemon
     Time: 3
    State: Waiting for next activation
     Info: NULL
  2 rows in set (0.00 sec)
  ```

  Event scheduling can be stopped by setting the value of
  [`event_scheduler`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_event_scheduler) to
  `OFF`.
- `OFF`: The Event Scheduler is stopped. The
  event scheduler thread does not run, is not shown in the
  output of [`SHOW PROCESSLIST`](show-processlist.md "15.7.7.29 SHOW PROCESSLIST Statement"), and
  no scheduled events execute.

  When the Event Scheduler is stopped
  ([`event_scheduler`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_event_scheduler) is
  `OFF`), it can be started by setting the
  value of [`event_scheduler`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_event_scheduler) to
  `ON`. (See next item.)
- `DISABLED`: This value renders the Event
  Scheduler nonoperational. When the Event Scheduler is
  `DISABLED`, the event scheduler thread does
  not run (and so does not appear in the output of
  [`SHOW PROCESSLIST`](show-processlist.md "15.7.7.29 SHOW PROCESSLIST Statement")). In addition,
  the Event Scheduler state cannot be changed at runtime.

If the Event Scheduler status has not been set to
`DISABLED`,
[`event_scheduler`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_event_scheduler) can be toggled
between `ON` and `OFF` (using
[`SET`](set-variable.md "15.7.6.1 SET Syntax for Variable Assignment")). It
is also possible to use `0` for
`OFF`, and `1` for
`ON` when setting this variable. Thus, any of the
following 4 statements can be used in the [**mysql**](mysql.md "6.5.1 mysql — The MySQL Command-Line Client")
client to turn on the Event Scheduler:

```sql
SET GLOBAL event_scheduler = ON;
SET @@GLOBAL.event_scheduler = ON;
SET GLOBAL event_scheduler = 1;
SET @@GLOBAL.event_scheduler = 1;
```

Similarly, any of these 4 statements can be used to turn off the
Event Scheduler:

```sql
SET GLOBAL event_scheduler = OFF;
SET @@GLOBAL.event_scheduler = OFF;
SET GLOBAL event_scheduler = 0;
SET @@GLOBAL.event_scheduler = 0;
```

Note

If the Event Scheduler is enabled, enabling the
[`super_read_only`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_super_read_only) system variable
prevents it from updating event “last executed”
timestamps in the `events` data dictionary
table. This causes the Event Scheduler to stop the next time it
tries to execute a scheduled event, after writing a message to
the server error log. (In this situation the
[`event_scheduler`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_event_scheduler) system variable
does not change from `ON` to
`OFF`. An implication is that this variable
rejects the DBA *intent* that the Event
Scheduler be enabled or disabled, where its actual status of
started or stopped may be distinct.). If
[`super_read_only`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_super_read_only) is subsequently
disabled after being enabled, the server automatically restarts
the Event Scheduler as needed, as of MySQL 8.0.26. Prior to
MySQL 8.0.26, it is necessary to manually restart the Event
Scheduler by enabling it again.

Although `ON` and `OFF` have
numeric equivalents, the value displayed for
[`event_scheduler`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_event_scheduler) by
[`SELECT`](select.md "15.2.13 SELECT Statement") or [`SHOW
VARIABLES`](show-variables.md "15.7.7.41 SHOW VARIABLES Statement") is always one of `OFF`,
`ON`, or `DISABLED`.
*`DISABLED` has no numeric
equivalent*. For this reason, `ON` and
`OFF` are usually preferred over
`1` and `0` when setting this
variable.

Note that attempting to set
[`event_scheduler`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_event_scheduler) without
specifying it as a global variable causes an error:

```sql
mysql< SET @@event_scheduler = OFF;
ERROR 1229 (HY000): Variable 'event_scheduler' is a GLOBAL
variable and should be set with SET GLOBAL
```

Important

It is possible to set the Event Scheduler to
`DISABLED` only at server startup. If
[`event_scheduler`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_event_scheduler) is
`ON` or `OFF`, you cannot set
it to `DISABLED` at runtime. Also, if the Event
Scheduler is set to `DISABLED` at startup, you
cannot change the value of
[`event_scheduler`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_event_scheduler) at runtime.

To disable the event scheduler, use one of the following two
methods:

- As a command-line option when starting the server:

  ```terminal
  --event-scheduler=DISABLED
  ```
- In the server configuration file (`my.cnf`,
  or `my.ini` on Windows systems), include
  the line where it can be read by the server (for example, in a
  `[mysqld]` section):

  ```ini
  event_scheduler=DISABLED
  ```

To enable the Event Scheduler, restart the server without the
[`--event-scheduler=DISABLED`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_event_scheduler)
command-line option, or after removing or commenting out the line
containing [`event-scheduler=DISABLED`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_event_scheduler)
in the server configuration file, as appropriate. Alternatively,
you can use `ON` (or `1`) or
`OFF` (or `0`) in place of the
`DISABLED` value when starting the server.

Note

You can issue event-manipulation statements when
[`event_scheduler`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_event_scheduler) is set to
`DISABLED`. No warnings or errors are generated
in such cases (provided that the statements are themselves
valid). However, scheduled events cannot execute until this
variable is set to `ON` (or
`1`). Once this has been done, the event
scheduler thread executes all events whose scheduling conditions
are satisfied.

Starting the MySQL server with the
[`--skip-grant-tables`](server-options.md#option_mysqld_skip-grant-tables) option causes
[`event_scheduler`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_event_scheduler) to be set to
`DISABLED`, overriding any other value set either
on the command line or in the `my.cnf` or
`my.ini` file (Bug #26807).

For SQL statements used to create, alter, and drop events, see
[Section 27.4.3, “Event Syntax”](events-syntax.md "27.4.3 Event Syntax").

MySQL provides an [`EVENTS`](information-schema-events-table.md "28.3.14 The INFORMATION_SCHEMA EVENTS Table") table in the
`INFORMATION_SCHEMA` database. This table can be
queried to obtain information about scheduled events which have
been defined on the server. See [Section 27.4.4, “Event Metadata”](events-metadata.md "27.4.4 Event Metadata"),
and [Section 28.3.14, “The INFORMATION\_SCHEMA EVENTS Table”](information-schema-events-table.md "28.3.14 The INFORMATION_SCHEMA EVENTS Table"), for more
information.

For information regarding event scheduling and the MySQL privilege
system, see [Section 27.4.6, “The Event Scheduler and MySQL Privileges”](events-privileges.md "27.4.6 The Event Scheduler and MySQL Privileges").
