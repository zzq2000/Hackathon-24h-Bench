### 17.20.5 Security Considerations for the InnoDB memcached Plugin

Caution

Consult this section before deploying the
`daemon_memcached` plugin on a production
server, or even on a test server if the MySQL instance contains
sensitive data.

Because **memcached** does not use an
authentication mechanism by default, and the optional SASL
authentication is not as strong as traditional DBMS security
measures, only keep non-sensitive data in the MySQL instance that
uses the `daemon_memcached` plugin, and wall off
any servers that use this configuration from potential intruders.
Do not allow **memcached** access to these servers
from the Internet; only allow access from within a firewalled
intranet, ideally from a subnet whose membership you can restrict.

#### Password-Protecting memcached Using SASL

SASL support provides the capability to protect your MySQL
database from unauthenticated access through
**memcached** clients. This section explains how
to enable SASL with the `daemon_memcached`
plugin. The steps are almost identical to those performed to
enabled SASL for a traditional **memcached**
server.

SASL stands for “Simple Authentication and Security
Layer”, a standard for adding authentication support to
connection-based protocols. **memcached** added
SASL support in version 1.4.3.

SASL authentication is only supported with the binary protocol.

**memcached** clients are only able to access
`InnoDB` tables that are registered in the
`innodb_memcache.containers` table. Even
though a DBA can place access restrictions on such tables,
access through **memcached** applications cannot
be controlled. For this reason, SASL support is provided to
control access to `InnoDB` tables associated
with the `daemon_memcached` plugin.

The following section shows how to build, enable, and test an
SASL-enabled `daemon_memcached` plugin.

#### Building and Enabling SASL with the InnoDB memcached Plugin

By default, an SASL-enabled `daemon_memcached`
plugin is not included in MySQL release packages, since an
SASL-enabled `daemon_memcached` plugin requires
building **memcached** with SASL libraries. To
enable SASL support, download the MySQL source and rebuild the
`daemon_memcached` plugin after downloading the
SASL libraries:

1. Install the SASL development and utility libraries. For
   example, on Ubuntu, use **apt-get** to obtain
   the libraries:

   ```terminal
   sudo apt-get -f install libsasl2-2 sasl2-bin libsasl2-2 libsasl2-dev libsasl2-modules
   ```
2. Build the `daemon_memcached` plugin shared
   libraries with SASL capability by adding
   `ENABLE_MEMCACHED_SASL=1` to your
   **cmake** options.
   **memcached** also provides *simple
   cleartext password support*, which facilitates
   testing. To enable simple cleartext password support,
   specify the `ENABLE_MEMCACHED_SASL_PWDB=1`
   **cmake** option.

   In summary, add following three **cmake**
   options:

   ```terminal
   cmake ... -DWITH_INNODB_MEMCACHED=1 -DENABLE_MEMCACHED_SASL=1 -DENABLE_MEMCACHED_SASL_PWDB=1
   ```
3. Install the `daemon_memcached` plugin, as
   described in [Section 17.20.3, “Setting Up the InnoDB memcached Plugin”](innodb-memcached-setup.md "17.20.3 Setting Up the InnoDB memcached Plugin").
4. Configure a user name and password file. (This example uses
   **memcached** simple cleartext password
   support.)

   1. In a file, create a user named
      `testname` and define the password as
      `testpasswd`:

      ```terminal
      echo "testname:testpasswd:::::::" >/home/jy/memcached-sasl-db
      ```
   2. Configure the `MEMCACHED_SASL_PWDB`
      environment variable to inform
      `memcached` of the user name and
      password file:

      ```terminal
      export MEMCACHED_SASL_PWDB=/home/jy/memcached-sasl-db
      ```
   3. Inform `memcached` that a cleartext
      password is used:

      ```terminal
      echo "mech_list: plain" > /home/jy/work2/msasl/clients/memcached.conf
      export SASL_CONF_PATH=/home/jy/work2/msasl/clients
      ```
5. Enable SASL by restarting the MySQL server with the
   **memcached** `-S` option
   encoded in the
   [`daemon_memcached_option`](innodb-parameters.md#sysvar_daemon_memcached_option)
   configuration parameter:

   ```terminal
   mysqld ... --daemon_memcached_option="-S"
   ```
6. To test the setup, use an SASL-enabled client such as
   [SASL-enabled
   libmemcached](https://code.launchpad.net/~trond-norbye/libmemcached/sasl).

   ```terminal
   memcp --servers=localhost:11211 --binary  --username=testname
     --password=password myfile.txt

   memcat --servers=localhost:11211 --binary --username=testname
     --password=password myfile.txt
   ```

   If you specify an incorrect user name or password, the
   operation is rejected with a `memcache error
   AUTHENTICATION FAILURE` message. In this case,
   examine the cleartext password set in the
   `memcached-sasl-db` file to verify that
   the credentials you supplied are correct.

There are other methods to test SASL authentication with
**memcached**, but the method described above is
the most straightforward.
