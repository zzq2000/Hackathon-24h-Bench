### 12.8.5 The binary Collation Compared to \_bin Collations

This section describes how the `binary`
collation for binary strings compares to `_bin`
collations for nonbinary strings.

Binary strings (as stored using the
[`BINARY`](binary-varbinary.md "13.3.3 The BINARY and VARBINARY Types"),
[`VARBINARY`](binary-varbinary.md "13.3.3 The BINARY and VARBINARY Types"), and
[`BLOB`](blob.md "13.3.4 The BLOB and TEXT Types") data types) have a character
set and collation named `binary`. Binary
strings are sequences of bytes and the numeric values of those
bytes determine comparison and sort order. See
[Section 12.10.8, “The Binary Character Set”](charset-binary-set.md "12.10.8 The Binary Character Set").

Nonbinary strings (as stored using the
[`CHAR`](char.md "13.3.2 The CHAR and VARCHAR Types"),
[`VARCHAR`](char.md "13.3.2 The CHAR and VARCHAR Types"), and
[`TEXT`](blob.md "13.3.4 The BLOB and TEXT Types") data types) have a character
set and collation other than `binary`. A given
nonbinary character set can have several collations, each of
which defines a particular comparison and sort order for the
characters in the set. For most character sets, one of these is
the binary collation, indicated by a `_bin`
suffix in the collation name. For example, the binary collations
for `latin1` and `big5` are
named `latin1_bin` and
`big5_bin`, respectively.
`utf8mb4` is an exception that has two binary
collations, `utf8mb4_bin` and
`utf8mb4_0900_bin`; see
[Section 12.10.1, “Unicode Character Sets”](charset-unicode-sets.md "12.10.1 Unicode Character Sets").

The `binary` collation differs from
`_bin` collations in several respects,
discussed in the following sections:

- [The Unit for Comparison and Sorting](charset-binary-collations.md#charset-binary-collations-comparison-units "The Unit for Comparison and Sorting")
- [Character Set Conversion](charset-binary-collations.md#charset-binary-collations-charset-conversion "Character Set Conversion")
- [Lettercase Conversion](charset-binary-collations.md#charset-binary-collations-lettercase-conversion "Lettercase Conversion")
- [Trailing Space Handling in Comparisons](charset-binary-collations.md#charset-binary-collations-trailing-space-comparisons "Trailing Space Handling in Comparisons")
- [Trailing Space Handling for Inserts and Retrievals](charset-binary-collations.md#charset-binary-collations-trailing-space-inserts-retrievals "Trailing Space Handling for Inserts and Retrievals")

#### The Unit for Comparison and Sorting

Binary strings are sequences of bytes. For the
`binary` collation, comparison and sorting
are based on numeric byte values. Nonbinary strings are
sequences of characters, which might be multibyte. Collations
for nonbinary strings define an ordering of the character
values for comparison and sorting. For `_bin`
collations, this ordering is based on numeric character code
values, which is similar to ordering for binary strings except
that character code values might be multibyte.

#### Character Set Conversion

A nonbinary string has a character set and is automatically
converted to another character set in many cases, even when
the string has a `_bin` collation:

- When assigning column values to another column that has a
  different character set:

  ```sql
  UPDATE t1 SET utf8mb4_bin_column=latin1_column;
  INSERT INTO t1 (latin1_column) SELECT utf8mb4_bin_column FROM t2;
  ```
- When assigning column values for
  [`INSERT`](insert.md "15.2.7 INSERT Statement") or
  [`UPDATE`](update.md "15.2.17 UPDATE Statement") using a string
  literal:

  ```sql
  SET NAMES latin1;
  INSERT INTO t1 (utf8mb4_bin_column) VALUES ('string-in-latin1');
  ```
- When sending results from the server to a client:

  ```sql
  SET NAMES latin1;
  SELECT utf8mb4_bin_column FROM t2;
  ```

For binary string columns, no conversion occurs. For cases
similar to those preceding, the string value is copied
byte-wise.

#### Lettercase Conversion

Collations for nonbinary character sets provide information
about lettercase of characters, so characters in a nonbinary
string can be converted from one lettercase to another, even
for `_bin` collations that ignore lettercase
for ordering:

```sql
mysql> SET NAMES utf8mb4 COLLATE utf8mb4_bin;
mysql> SELECT LOWER('aA'), UPPER('zZ');
+-------------+-------------+
| LOWER('aA') | UPPER('zZ') |
+-------------+-------------+
| aa          | ZZ          |
+-------------+-------------+
```

The concept of lettercase does not apply to bytes in a binary
string. To perform lettercase conversion, the string must
first be converted to a nonbinary string using a character set
appropriate for the data stored in the string:

```sql
mysql> SET NAMES binary;
mysql> SELECT LOWER('aA'), LOWER(CONVERT('aA' USING utf8mb4));
+-------------+------------------------------------+
| LOWER('aA') | LOWER(CONVERT('aA' USING utf8mb4)) |
+-------------+------------------------------------+
| aA          | aa                                 |
+-------------+------------------------------------+
```

#### Trailing Space Handling in Comparisons

MySQL collations have a pad attribute, which has a value of
`PAD SPACE` or `NO PAD`:

- Most MySQL collations have a pad attribute of `PAD
  SPACE`.
- The Unicode collations based on UCA 9.0.0 and higher have
  a pad attribute of `NO PAD`; see
  [Section 12.10.1, “Unicode Character Sets”](charset-unicode-sets.md "12.10.1 Unicode Character Sets").

For nonbinary strings (`CHAR`,
`VARCHAR`, and `TEXT`
values), the string collation pad attribute determines
treatment in comparisons of trailing spaces at the end of
strings:

- For `PAD SPACE` collations, trailing
  spaces are insignificant in comparisons; strings are
  compared without regard to trailing spaces.
- `NO PAD` collations treat trailing spaces
  as significant in comparisons, like any other character.

The differing behaviors can be demonstrated using the two
`utf8mb4` binary collations, one of which is
`PAD SPACE`, the other of which is
`NO PAD`. The example also shows how to use
the `INFORMATION_SCHEMA`
[`COLLATIONS`](information-schema-collations-table.md "28.3.6 The INFORMATION_SCHEMA COLLATIONS Table") table to determine the
pad attribute for collations.

```sql
mysql> SELECT COLLATION_NAME, PAD_ATTRIBUTE
       FROM INFORMATION_SCHEMA.COLLATIONS
       WHERE COLLATION_NAME LIKE 'utf8mb4%bin';
+------------------+---------------+
| COLLATION_NAME   | PAD_ATTRIBUTE |
+------------------+---------------+
| utf8mb4_bin      | PAD SPACE     |
| utf8mb4_0900_bin | NO PAD        |
+------------------+---------------+
mysql> SET NAMES utf8mb4 COLLATE utf8mb4_bin;
mysql> SELECT 'a ' = 'a';
+------------+
| 'a ' = 'a' |
+------------+
|          1 |
+------------+
mysql> SET NAMES utf8mb4 COLLATE utf8mb4_0900_bin;
mysql> SELECT 'a ' = 'a';
+------------+
| 'a ' = 'a' |
+------------+
|          0 |
+------------+
```

Note

“Comparison” in this context does not include
the [`LIKE`](string-comparison-functions.md#operator_like) pattern-matching
operator, for which trailing spaces are significant,
regardless of collation.

For binary strings (`BINARY`,
`VARBINARY`, and `BLOB`
values), all bytes are significant in comparisons, including
trailing spaces:

```sql
mysql> SET NAMES binary;
mysql> SELECT 'a ' = 'a';
+------------+
| 'a ' = 'a' |
+------------+
|          0 |
+------------+
```

#### Trailing Space Handling for Inserts and Retrievals

`CHAR(N)` columns
store nonbinary strings *`N`*
characters long. For inserts, values shorter than
*`N`* characters are extended with
spaces. For retrievals, trailing spaces are removed.

`BINARY(N)`
columns store binary strings *`N`*
bytes long. For inserts, values shorter than
*`N`* bytes are extended with
`0x00` bytes. For retrievals, nothing is
removed; a value of the declared length is always returned.

```sql
mysql> CREATE TABLE t1 (
         a CHAR(10) CHARACTER SET utf8mb4 COLLATE utf8mb4_bin,
         b BINARY(10)
       );
mysql> INSERT INTO t1 VALUES ('x','x');
mysql> INSERT INTO t1 VALUES ('x ','x ');
mysql> SELECT a, b, HEX(a), HEX(b) FROM t1;
+------+------------------------+--------+----------------------+
| a    | b                      | HEX(a) | HEX(b)               |
+------+------------------------+--------+----------------------+
| x    | 0x78000000000000000000 | 78     | 78000000000000000000 |
| x    | 0x78200000000000000000 | 78     | 78200000000000000000 |
+------+------------------------+--------+----------------------+
```
