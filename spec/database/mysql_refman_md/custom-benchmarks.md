### 10.13.2 Using Your Own Benchmarks

Benchmark your application and database to find out where the
bottlenecks are. After fixing one bottleneck (or by replacing it
with a “dummy” module), you can proceed to identify
the next bottleneck. Even if the overall performance for your
application currently is acceptable, you should at least make a
plan for each bottleneck and decide how to solve it if someday
you really need the extra performance.

A free benchmark suite is the Open Source Database Benchmark,
available at <http://osdb.sourceforge.net/>.

It is very common for a problem to occur only when the system is
very heavily loaded. We have had many customers who contact us
when they have a (tested) system in production and have
encountered load problems. In most cases, performance problems
turn out to be due to issues of basic database design (for
example, table scans are not good under high load) or problems
with the operating system or libraries. Most of the time, these
problems would be much easier to fix if the systems were not
already in production.

To avoid problems like this, benchmark your whole application
under the worst possible load:

- The [**mysqlslap**](mysqlslap.md "6.5.8 mysqlslap — A Load Emulation Client") program can be helpful for
  simulating a high load produced by multiple clients issuing
  queries simultaneously. See [Section 6.5.8, “mysqlslap — A Load Emulation Client”](mysqlslap.md "6.5.8 mysqlslap — A Load Emulation Client").
- You can also try benchmarking packages such as SysBench and
  DBT2, available at
  <https://launchpad.net/sysbench>, and
  <http://osdldbt.sourceforge.net/#dbt2>.

These programs or packages can bring a system to its knees, so
be sure to use them only on your development systems.
