### 7.6.8 The Keyring Proxy Bridge Plugin

MySQL Keyring originally implemented keystore capabilities using
server plugins, but began transitioning to use the component
infrastructure in MySQL 8.0.24. The transition includes revising
the underlying implementation of keyring plugins to use the
component infrastructure. This is facilitated using the plugin
named `daemon_keyring_proxy_plugin` that acts as
a bridge between the plugin and component service APIs, and
enables keyring plugins to continue to be used with no change to
user-visible characteristics.

`daemon_keyring_proxy_plugin` is built in and
nothing need be done to install or enable it.
