### 10.15.9 The end\_markers\_in\_json System Variable

When reading a very large JSON document, it can be difficult to
pair its closing bracket and opening brackets; setting
[`end_markers_in_json=ON`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_end_markers_in_json) repeats
the structure's key, if it has one, near the closing bracket.
This variable affects both optimizer traces and the output of
`EXPLAIN FORMAT=JSON`.

Note

If [`end_markers_in_json`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_end_markers_in_json) is
enabled, the repetition of the key means the result is not a
valid JSON document, and causes JSON parsers to throw an error.
