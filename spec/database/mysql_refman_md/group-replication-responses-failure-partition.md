#### 20.7.7.2 Unreachable Majority Timeout

By default, members that find themselves in a minority due to a
network partition do not automatically leave the group. You can
use the system variable
[`group_replication_unreachable_majority_timeout`](group-replication-system-variables.md#sysvar_group_replication_unreachable_majority_timeout)
to set a number of seconds for a member to wait after losing
contact with the majority of group members, and then exit the
group. Setting a timeout means you do not need to pro-actively
monitor for servers that are in a minority group after a network
partition, and you can avoid the possibility of creating a
split-brain situation (with two versions of the group
membership) due to inappropriate intervention.

When the timeout specified by
[`group_replication_unreachable_majority_timeout`](group-replication-system-variables.md#sysvar_group_replication_unreachable_majority_timeout)
elapses, all pending transactions that have been processed by
the member and the others in the minority group are rolled back,
and the servers in that group move to the
`ERROR` state. You can use the
[`group_replication_autorejoin_tries`](group-replication-system-variables.md#sysvar_group_replication_autorejoin_tries)
system variable, which is available from MySQL 8.0.16, to make
the member automatically try to rejoin the group at this point.
From MySQL 8.0.21, this feature is activated by default and the
member makes three auto-rejoin attempts. If the auto-rejoin
procedure does not succeed or is not attempted, the minority
member then follows the exit action specified by
[`group_replication_exit_state_action`](group-replication-system-variables.md#sysvar_group_replication_exit_state_action).

Consider the following points when deciding whether or not to
set an unreachable majority timeout:

- In a symmetric group, for example a group with two or four
  servers, if both partitions contain an equal number of
  servers, both groups consider themselves to be in a minority
  and enter the `ERROR` state. In this
  situation, the group has no functional partition.
- While a minority group exists, any transactions processed by
  the minority group are accepted, but blocked because the
  minority servers cannot reach quorum, until either
  [`STOP GROUP_REPLICATION`](stop-group-replication.md "15.4.3.2 STOP GROUP_REPLICATION Statement") is
  issued on those servers or the unreachable majority timeout
  is reached.
- If you do not set an unreachable majority timeout, the
  servers in the minority group never enter the
  `ERROR` state automatically, and you must
  stop them manually.
- Setting an unreachable majority timeout has no effect if it
  is set on the servers in the minority group after the loss
  of majority has been detected.

If you do not use the
[`group_replication_unreachable_majority_timeout`](group-replication-system-variables.md#sysvar_group_replication_unreachable_majority_timeout)system
variable, the process for operator invention in the event of a
network partition is described in
[Section 20.7.8, “Handling a Network Partition and Loss of Quorum”](group-replication-network-partitioning.md "20.7.8 Handling a Network Partition and Loss of Quorum"). The
process involves checking which servers are functioning and
forcing a new group membership if necessary.
