### 14.24.3 Expression Handling

With precision math, exact-value numbers are used as given
whenever possible. For example, numbers in comparisons are used
exactly as given without a change in value. In strict SQL mode,
for [`INSERT`](insert.md "15.2.7 INSERT Statement") into a column with an
exact data type ([`DECIMAL`](fixed-point-types.md "13.1.3 Fixed-Point Types (Exact Value) - DECIMAL, NUMERIC") or
integer), a number is inserted with its exact value if it is
within the column range. When retrieved, the value should be the
same as what was inserted. (If strict SQL mode is not enabled,
truncation for [`INSERT`](insert.md "15.2.7 INSERT Statement") is
permissible.)

Handling of a numeric expression depends on what kind of values
the expression contains:

- If any approximate values are present, the expression is
  approximate and is evaluated using floating-point arithmetic.
- If no approximate values are present, the expression contains
  only exact values. If any exact value contains a fractional
  part (a value following the decimal point), the expression is
  evaluated using [`DECIMAL`](fixed-point-types.md "13.1.3 Fixed-Point Types (Exact Value) - DECIMAL, NUMERIC") exact
  arithmetic and has a precision of 65 digits. The term
  “exact” is subject to the limits of what can be
  represented in binary. For example, `1.0/3.0`
  can be approximated in decimal notation as
  `.333...`, but not written as an exact
  number, so `(1.0/3.0)*3.0` does not evaluate
  to exactly `1.0`.
- Otherwise, the expression contains only integer values. The
  expression is exact and is evaluated using integer arithmetic
  and has a precision the same as
  [`BIGINT`](integer-types.md "13.1.2 Integer Types (Exact Value) - INTEGER, INT, SMALLINT, TINYINT, MEDIUMINT, BIGINT") (64 bits).

If a numeric expression contains any strings, they are converted
to double-precision floating-point values and the expression is
approximate.

Inserts into numeric columns are affected by the SQL mode, which
is controlled by the [`sql_mode`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_sql_mode)
system variable. (See [Section 7.1.11, “Server SQL Modes”](sql-mode.md "7.1.11 Server SQL Modes").) The following
discussion mentions strict mode (selected by the
[`STRICT_ALL_TABLES`](sql-mode.md#sqlmode_strict_all_tables) or
[`STRICT_TRANS_TABLES`](sql-mode.md#sqlmode_strict_trans_tables) mode values)
and [`ERROR_FOR_DIVISION_BY_ZERO`](sql-mode.md#sqlmode_error_for_division_by_zero).
To turn on all restrictions, you can simply use
[`TRADITIONAL`](sql-mode.md#sqlmode_traditional) mode, which includes
both strict mode values and
[`ERROR_FOR_DIVISION_BY_ZERO`](sql-mode.md#sqlmode_error_for_division_by_zero):

```sql
SET sql_mode='TRADITIONAL';
```

If a number is inserted into an exact type column
([`DECIMAL`](fixed-point-types.md "13.1.3 Fixed-Point Types (Exact Value) - DECIMAL, NUMERIC") or integer), it is
inserted with its exact value if it is within the column range and
precision.

If the value has too many digits in the fractional part, rounding
occurs and a note is generated. Rounding is done as described in
[Section 14.24.4, “Rounding Behavior”](precision-math-rounding.md "14.24.4 Rounding Behavior"). Truncation due to
rounding of the fractional part is not an error, even in strict
mode.

If the value has too many digits in the integer part, it is too
large (out of range) and is handled as follows:

- If strict mode is not enabled, the value is truncated to the
  nearest legal value and a warning is generated.
- If strict mode is enabled, an overflow error occurs.

Prior to MySQL 8.0.31, for [`DECIMAL`](fixed-point-types.md "13.1.3 Fixed-Point Types (Exact Value) - DECIMAL, NUMERIC")
literals, in addition to the precision limit of 65 digits, there
is a limit on how long the text of the literal can be. If the
value exceeds approximately 80 characters, unexpected results can
occur. For example:

```sql
mysql> SELECT
       CAST(0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000020.01 AS DECIMAL(15,2)) as val;
+------------------+
| val              |
+------------------+
| 9999999999999.99 |
+------------------+
1 row in set, 2 warnings (0.00 sec)

mysql> SHOW WARNINGS;
+---------+------+----------------------------------------------+
| Level   | Code | Message                                      |
+---------+------+----------------------------------------------+
| Warning | 1292 | Truncated incorrect DECIMAL value: '20'      |
| Warning | 1264 | Out of range value for column 'val' at row 1 |
+---------+------+----------------------------------------------+
2 rows in set (0.00 sec)
```

As of MySQL 8.0.31, this should no longer be an issue, as shown
here:

```sql
mysql> SELECT
       CAST(0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000020.01 AS DECIMAL(15,2)) as val;
+-------+
| val   |
+-------+
| 20.01 |
+-------+
1 row in set (0.00 sec)
```

Underflow is not detected, so underflow handling is undefined.

For inserts of strings into numeric columns, conversion from
string to number is handled as follows if the string has
nonnumeric contents:

- A string that does not begin with a number cannot be used as a
  number and produces an error in strict mode, or a warning
  otherwise. This includes the empty string.
- A string that begins with a number can be converted, but the
  trailing nonnumeric portion is truncated. If the truncated
  portion contains anything other than spaces, this produces an
  error in strict mode, or a warning otherwise.

By default, division by zero produces a result of
`NULL` and no warning. By setting the SQL mode
appropriately, division by zero can be restricted.

With the
[`ERROR_FOR_DIVISION_BY_ZERO`](sql-mode.md#sqlmode_error_for_division_by_zero) SQL
mode enabled, MySQL handles division by zero differently:

- If strict mode is not enabled, a warning occurs.
- If strict mode is enabled, inserts and updates involving
  division by zero are prohibited, and an error occurs.

In other words, inserts and updates involving expressions that
perform division by zero can be treated as errors, but this
requires
[`ERROR_FOR_DIVISION_BY_ZERO`](sql-mode.md#sqlmode_error_for_division_by_zero) in
addition to strict mode.

Suppose that we have this statement:

```sql
INSERT INTO t SET i = 1/0;
```

This is what happens for combinations of strict and
[`ERROR_FOR_DIVISION_BY_ZERO`](sql-mode.md#sqlmode_error_for_division_by_zero)
modes.

| [`sql_mode`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_sql_mode) Value | Result |
| --- | --- |
| `''` (Default) | No warning, no error; `i` is set to `NULL`. |
| strict | No warning, no error; `i` is set to `NULL`. |
| [`ERROR_FOR_DIVISION_BY_ZERO`](sql-mode.md#sqlmode_error_for_division_by_zero) | Warning, no error; `i` is set to `NULL`. |
| strict,[`ERROR_FOR_DIVISION_BY_ZERO`](sql-mode.md#sqlmode_error_for_division_by_zero) | Error condition; no row is inserted. |
