## 32.6 MySQL Enterprise Thread Pool Overview

MySQL Enterprise Edition includes MySQL Enterprise Thread Pool, implemented using a server plugin. The
default thread-handling model in MySQL Server executes statements
using one thread per client connection. As more clients connect to
the server and execute statements, overall performance degrades.
In MySQL Enterprise Edition, a thread pool plugin provides an alternative
thread-handling model designed to reduce overhead and improve
performance. The plugin implements a thread pool that increases
server performance by efficiently managing statement execution
threads for large numbers of client connections.
