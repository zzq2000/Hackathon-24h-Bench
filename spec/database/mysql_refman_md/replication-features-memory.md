#### 19.5.1.21 Replication and MEMORY Tables

When a replication source server shuts down and restarts, its
[`MEMORY`](memory-storage-engine.md "18.3 The MEMORY Storage Engine") tables become empty. To
replicate this effect to replicas, the first time that the
source uses a given [`MEMORY`](memory-storage-engine.md "18.3 The MEMORY Storage Engine") table
after startup, it logs an event that notifies replicas that the
table must be emptied by writing a
[`DELETE`](delete.md "15.2.2 DELETE Statement") or (from MySQL 8.0.22)
[`TRUNCATE TABLE`](truncate-table.md "15.1.37 TRUNCATE TABLE Statement") statement for that
table to the binary log. This generated event is identifiable by
a comment in the binary log, and if GTIDs are in use on the
server, it has a GTID assigned. The statement is always logged
in statement format, even if the binary logging format is set to
`ROW`, and it is written even if
`read_only` or
`super_read_only` mode is set on the server.
Note that the replica still has outdated data in a
[`MEMORY`](memory-storage-engine.md "18.3 The MEMORY Storage Engine") table during the interval
between the source's restart and its first use of the table. To
avoid this interval when a direct query to the replica could
return stale data, you can set the
[`init_file`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_init_file) system variable to
name a file containing statements that populate the
`MEMORY` table on the source at startup.

When a replica server shuts down and restarts, its
[`MEMORY`](memory-storage-engine.md "18.3 The MEMORY Storage Engine") tables become empty. This
causes the replica to be out of synchrony with the source and
may lead to other failures or cause the replica to stop:

- Row-format updates and deletes received from the source may
  fail with `Can't find record in
  'memory_table'`.
- Statements such as
  [`INSERT INTO
  ... SELECT FROM
  memory_table`](insert-select.md "15.2.7.1 INSERT ... SELECT Statement") may insert
  a different set of rows on the source and replica.

The replica also writes a [`DELETE`](delete.md "15.2.2 DELETE Statement")
or (from MySQL 8.0.22) [`TRUNCATE
TABLE`](truncate-table.md "15.1.37 TRUNCATE TABLE Statement") statement to its own binary log, which is passed
on to any downstream replicas, causing them to empty their own
[`MEMORY`](memory-storage-engine.md "18.3 The MEMORY Storage Engine") tables.

The safe way to restart a replica that is replicating
[`MEMORY`](memory-storage-engine.md "18.3 The MEMORY Storage Engine") tables is to first drop or
delete all rows from the [`MEMORY`](memory-storage-engine.md "18.3 The MEMORY Storage Engine")
tables on the source and wait until those changes have
replicated to the replica. Then it is safe to restart the
replica.

An alternative restart method may apply in some cases. When
[`binlog_format=ROW`](replication-options-binary-log.md#sysvar_binlog_format), you can
prevent the replica from stopping if you set
[`replica_exec_mode=IDEMPOTENT`](replication-options-replica.md#sysvar_replica_exec_mode)
(from MySQL 8.0.26) or
[`slave_exec_mode=IDEMPOTENT`](replication-options-replica.md#sysvar_slave_exec_mode)
(before MySQL 8.0.26) before you start the replica again. This
allows the replica to continue to replicate, but its
[`MEMORY`](memory-storage-engine.md "18.3 The MEMORY Storage Engine") tables still differ from
those on the source. This is acceptable if the application logic
is such that the contents of [`MEMORY`](memory-storage-engine.md "18.3 The MEMORY Storage Engine")
tables can be safely lost (for example, if the
[`MEMORY`](memory-storage-engine.md "18.3 The MEMORY Storage Engine") tables are used for
caching).
[`replica_exec_mode=IDEMPOTENT`](replication-options-replica.md#sysvar_replica_exec_mode) or
[`slave_exec_mode=IDEMPOTENT`](replication-options-replica.md#sysvar_slave_exec_mode)
applies globally to all tables, so it may hide other replication
errors in non-[`MEMORY`](memory-storage-engine.md "18.3 The MEMORY Storage Engine") tables.

(The method just described is not applicable in NDB Cluster,
where [`replica_exec_mode`](replication-options-replica.md#sysvar_replica_exec_mode) or
[`slave_exec_mode`](replication-options-replica.md#sysvar_slave_exec_mode) is always
`IDEMPOTENT`, and cannot be changed.)

The size of [`MEMORY`](memory-storage-engine.md "18.3 The MEMORY Storage Engine") tables is
limited by the value of the
[`max_heap_table_size`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_max_heap_table_size) system
variable, which is not replicated (see
[Section 19.5.1.39, “Replication and Variables”](replication-features-variables.md "19.5.1.39 Replication and Variables")). A change in
`max_heap_table_size` takes effect for
`MEMORY` tables that are created or updated
using [`ALTER TABLE
... ENGINE = MEMORY`](alter-table.md "15.1.9 ALTER TABLE Statement") or [`TRUNCATE
TABLE`](truncate-table.md "15.1.37 TRUNCATE TABLE Statement") following the change, or for all
[`MEMORY`](memory-storage-engine.md "18.3 The MEMORY Storage Engine") tables following a server
restart. If you increase the value of this variable on the
source without doing so on the replica, it becomes possible for
a table on the source to grow larger than its counterpart on the
replica, leading to inserts that succeed on the source but fail
on the replica with Table is full errors.
This is a known issue (Bug #48666). In such cases, you must set
the global value of
[`max_heap_table_size`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_max_heap_table_size) on the
replica as well as on the source, then restart replication. It
is also recommended that you restart both the source and replica
MySQL servers, to ensure that the new value takes complete
(global) effect on each of them.

See [Section 18.3, “The MEMORY Storage Engine”](memory-storage-engine.md "18.3 The MEMORY Storage Engine"), for more
information about [`MEMORY`](memory-storage-engine.md "18.3 The MEMORY Storage Engine") tables.
