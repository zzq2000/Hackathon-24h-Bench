### 13.3.2 The CHAR and VARCHAR Types

The `CHAR` and `VARCHAR` types
are similar, but differ in the way they are stored and
retrieved. They also differ in maximum length and in whether
trailing spaces are retained.

The `CHAR` and `VARCHAR` types
are declared with a length that indicates the maximum number of
characters you want to store. For example,
`CHAR(30)` can hold up to 30 characters.

The length of a `CHAR` column is fixed to the
length that you declare when you create the table. The length
can be any value from 0 to 255. When `CHAR`
values are stored, they are right-padded with spaces to the
specified length. When `CHAR` values are
retrieved, trailing spaces are removed unless the
[`PAD_CHAR_TO_FULL_LENGTH`](sql-mode.md#sqlmode_pad_char_to_full_length) SQL
mode is enabled.

Values in `VARCHAR` columns are variable-length
strings. The length can be specified as a value from 0 to
65,535. The effective maximum length of a
`VARCHAR` is subject to the maximum row size
(65,535 bytes, which is shared among all columns) and the
character set used. See [Section 10.4.7, “Limits on Table Column Count and Row Size”](column-count-limit.md "10.4.7 Limits on Table Column Count and Row Size").

In contrast to `CHAR`,
`VARCHAR` values are stored as a 1-byte or
2-byte length prefix plus data. The length prefix indicates the
number of bytes in the value. A column uses one length byte if
values require no more than 255 bytes, two length bytes if
values may require more than 255 bytes.

If strict SQL mode is not enabled and you assign a value to a
`CHAR` or `VARCHAR` column
that exceeds the column's maximum length, the value is truncated
to fit and a warning is generated. For truncation of nonspace
characters, you can cause an error to occur (rather than a
warning) and suppress insertion of the value by using strict SQL
mode. See [Section 7.1.11, “Server SQL Modes”](sql-mode.md "7.1.11 Server SQL Modes").

For `VARCHAR` columns, trailing spaces in
excess of the column length are truncated prior to insertion and
a warning is generated, regardless of the SQL mode in use. For
`CHAR` columns, truncation of excess trailing
spaces from inserted values is performed silently regardless of
the SQL mode.

`VARCHAR` values are not padded when they are
stored. Trailing spaces are retained when values are stored and
retrieved, in conformance with standard SQL.

The following table illustrates the differences between
`CHAR` and `VARCHAR` by
showing the result of storing various string values into
`CHAR(4)` and `VARCHAR(4)`
columns (assuming that the column uses a single-byte character
set such as `latin1`).

| Value | `CHAR(4)` | Storage Required | `VARCHAR(4)` | Storage Required |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `''` | `'    '` | 4 bytes | `''` | 1 byte |
| `'ab'` | `'ab  '` | 4 bytes | `'ab'` | 3 bytes |
| `'abcd'` | `'abcd'` | 4 bytes | `'abcd'` | 5 bytes |
| `'abcdefgh'` | `'abcd'` | 4 bytes | `'abcd'` | 5 bytes |

The values shown as stored in the last row of the table apply
*only when not using strict SQL mode*; if
strict mode is enabled, values that exceed the column length are
*not stored*, and an error results.

`InnoDB` encodes fixed-length fields greater
than or equal to 768 bytes in length as variable-length fields,
which can be stored off-page. For example, a
`CHAR(255)` column can exceed 768 bytes if the
maximum byte length of the character set is greater than 3, as
it is with `utf8mb4`.

If a given value is stored into the `CHAR(4)`
and `VARCHAR(4)` columns, the values retrieved
from the columns are not always the same because trailing spaces
are removed from `CHAR` columns upon retrieval.
The following example illustrates this difference:

```sql
mysql> CREATE TABLE vc (v VARCHAR(4), c CHAR(4));
Query OK, 0 rows affected (0.01 sec)

mysql> INSERT INTO vc VALUES ('ab  ', 'ab  ');
Query OK, 1 row affected (0.00 sec)

mysql> SELECT CONCAT('(', v, ')'), CONCAT('(', c, ')') FROM vc;
+---------------------+---------------------+
| CONCAT('(', v, ')') | CONCAT('(', c, ')') |
+---------------------+---------------------+
| (ab  )              | (ab)                |
+---------------------+---------------------+
1 row in set (0.06 sec)
```

Values in `CHAR`, `VARCHAR`,
and `TEXT` columns are sorted and compared
according to the character set collation assigned to the column.

MySQL collations have a pad attribute of `PAD
SPACE`, other than Unicode collations based on UCA
9.0.0 and higher, which have a pad attribute of `NO
PAD`. (see [Section 12.10.1, “Unicode Character Sets”](charset-unicode-sets.md "12.10.1 Unicode Character Sets")).

To determine the pad attribute for a collation, use the
`INFORMATION_SCHEMA`
[`COLLATIONS`](information-schema-collations-table.md "28.3.6 The INFORMATION_SCHEMA COLLATIONS Table") table, which has a
`PAD_ATTRIBUTE` column.

For nonbinary strings (`CHAR`,
`VARCHAR`, and `TEXT` values),
the string collation pad attribute determines treatment in
comparisons of trailing spaces at the end of strings.
`NO PAD` collations treat trailing spaces as
significant in comparisons, like any other character.
`PAD SPACE` collations treat trailing spaces as
insignificant in comparisons; strings are compared without
regard to trailing spaces. See
[Trailing Space Handling in Comparisons](charset-binary-collations.md#charset-binary-collations-trailing-space-comparisons "Trailing Space Handling in Comparisons").
The server SQL mode has no effect on comparison behavior with
respect to trailing spaces.

Note

For more information about MySQL character sets and
collations, see [Chapter 12, *Character Sets, Collations, Unicode*](charset.md "Chapter 12 Character Sets, Collations, Unicode"). For additional
information about storage requirements, see
[Section 13.7, “Data Type Storage Requirements”](storage-requirements.md "13.7 Data Type Storage Requirements").

For those cases where trailing pad characters are stripped or
comparisons ignore them, if a column has an index that requires
unique values, inserting into the column values that differ only
in number of trailing pad characters results in a duplicate-key
error. For example, if a table contains `'a'`,
an attempt to store `'a '` causes a
duplicate-key error.
