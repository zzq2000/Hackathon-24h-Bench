#### 25.2.7.4 NDB Cluster Error Handling

Starting, stopping, or restarting a node may give rise to
temporary errors causing some transactions to fail. These
include the following cases:

- **Temporary errors.**
  When first starting a node, it is possible that you may
  see Error 1204 Temporary failure, distribution
  changed and similar temporary errors.
- **Errors due to node failure.**
  The stopping or failure of any data node can result in a
  number of different node failure errors. (However, there
  should be no aborted transactions when performing a
  planned shutdown of the cluster.)

In either of these cases, any errors that are generated must be
handled within the application. This should be done by retrying
the transaction.
