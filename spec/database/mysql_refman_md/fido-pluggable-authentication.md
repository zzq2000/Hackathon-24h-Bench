#### 8.4.1.11 FIDO Pluggable Authentication

Note

FIDO pluggable authentication is an extension included in
MySQL Enterprise Edition, a commercial product. To learn more about commercial
products, see <https://www.mysql.com/products/>.

MySQL Enterprise Edition supports an authentication method that enables users to
authenticate to MySQL Server using FIDO authentication. This
authentication method is deprecated as of MySQL 8.0.35 and is
subject to removal in a future MySQL release. For similar
capabilities, consider upgrading to MySQL 8.2 (or higher) where
users can authenticate to MySQL Server using
[WebAuthn
authentication](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.4/en/webauthn-pluggable-authentication.html). You need to understand the release model
for MySQL innovation and long-term support (LTS) versions before
you proceed with an upgrade. For more information, see
[Section 3.2, “Upgrade Paths”](upgrade-paths.md "3.2 Upgrade Paths").

FIDO stands for Fast Identity Online, which provides standards
for authentication that does not require use of passwords.

FIDO pluggable authentication provides these capabilities:

- FIDO enables authentication to MySQL Server using devices
  such as smart cards, security keys, and biometric readers.
- Because authentication can occur other than by providing a
  password, FIDO enables passwordless authentication.
- On the other hand, device authentication is often used in
  conjunction with password authentication, so FIDO
  authentication can be used to good effect for MySQL accounts
  that use multifactor authentication; see
  [Section 8.2.18, “Multifactor Authentication”](multifactor-authentication.md "8.2.18 Multifactor Authentication").

The following table shows the plugin and library file names. The
file name suffix might differ on your system. Common suffixes
are `.so` for Unix and Unix-like systems, and
`.dll` for Windows. The file must be located
in the directory named by the
[`plugin_dir`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_plugin_dir) system variable. For
installation information, see
[Installing FIDO Pluggable Authentication](fido-pluggable-authentication.md#fido-pluggable-authentication-installation "Installing FIDO Pluggable Authentication").

**Table 8.27 Plugin and Library Names for FIDO Authentication**

| Plugin or File | Plugin or File Name |
| --- | --- |
| Server-side plugin | `authentication_fido` |
| Client-side plugin | `authentication_fido_client` |
| Library file | `authentication_fido.so`, `authentication_fido_client.so` |

Note

A `libfido2` library must be available on
systems where either the server-side or client-side FIDO
authentication plugin is used. If a host machine has more than
one FIDO device, the `libfido2` library
decides which device to use for registration and
authentication. The `libfido2` library does
not provide a facility for device selection.

The server-side FIDO authentication plugin is included only in
MySQL Enterprise Edition. It is not included in MySQL community distributions. The
client-side plugin is included in all distributions, including
community distributions, which enables clients from any
distribution to connect to a server that has the server-side
plugin loaded.

The following sections provide installation and usage
information specific to FIDO pluggable authentication:

- [Using FIDO Authentication](fido-pluggable-authentication.md#fido-pluggable-authentication-usage "Using FIDO Authentication")
- [FIDO Passwordless Authentication](fido-pluggable-authentication.md#fido-pluggable-authentication-passwordless "FIDO Passwordless Authentication")
- [FIDO Device Unregistration](fido-pluggable-authentication.md#fido-pluggable-authentication-unregistration "FIDO Device Unregistration")
- [How FIDO Authentication of MySQL Users Works](fido-pluggable-authentication.md#fido-pluggable-authentication-process "How FIDO Authentication of MySQL Users Works")

For general information about pluggable authentication in MySQL,
see [Section 8.2.17, “Pluggable Authentication”](pluggable-authentication.md "8.2.17 Pluggable Authentication").

##### Installing FIDO Pluggable Authentication

This section describes how to install the server-side FIDO
authentication plugin. For general information about
installing plugins, see [Section 7.6.1, “Installing and Uninstalling Plugins”](plugin-loading.md "7.6.1 Installing and Uninstalling Plugins").

To be usable by the server, the plugin library file must be
located in the MySQL plugin directory (the directory named by
the [`plugin_dir`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_plugin_dir) system
variable). If necessary, configure the plugin directory
location by setting the value of
[`plugin_dir`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_plugin_dir) at server startup.

The server-side plugin library file base name is
`authentication_fido`. The file name suffix
differs per platform (for example, `.so`
for Unix and Unix-like systems, `.dll` for
Windows).

To load the plugin at server startup, use the
[`--plugin-load-add`](server-options.md#option_mysqld_plugin-load-add) option to
name the library file that contains it. With this
plugin-loading method, the option must be given each time the
server starts.

To load the plugin, put a line such as this in your
`my.cnf` file, adjusting the
`.so` suffix for your platform as
necessary:

```ini
[mysqld]
plugin-load-add=authentication_fido.so
```

After modifying `my.cnf`, restart the
server to cause the new setting to take effect.

Alternatively, to load the plugin at runtime, use this
statement, adjusting the `.so` suffix for
your platform as necessary:

```sql
INSTALL PLUGIN authentication_fido
  SONAME 'authentication_fido.so';
```

[`INSTALL PLUGIN`](install-plugin.md "15.7.4.4 INSTALL PLUGIN Statement") loads the plugin
immediately, and also registers it in the
`mysql.plugins` system table to cause the
server to load it for each subsequent normal startup without
the need for [`--plugin-load-add`](server-options.md#option_mysqld_plugin-load-add).

To verify plugin installation, examine the Information Schema
[`PLUGINS`](information-schema-plugins-table.md "28.3.22 The INFORMATION_SCHEMA PLUGINS Table") table or use the
[`SHOW PLUGINS`](show-plugins.md "15.7.7.25 SHOW PLUGINS Statement") statement (see
[Section 7.6.2, “Obtaining Server Plugin Information”](obtaining-plugin-information.md "7.6.2 Obtaining Server Plugin Information")). For example:

```sql
mysql> SELECT PLUGIN_NAME, PLUGIN_STATUS
       FROM INFORMATION_SCHEMA.PLUGINS
       WHERE PLUGIN_NAME = 'authentication_fido';
+---------------------+---------------+
| PLUGIN_NAME         | PLUGIN_STATUS |
+---------------------+---------------+
| authentication_fido | ACTIVE        |
+---------------------+---------------+
```

If a plugin fails to initialize, check the server error log
for diagnostic messages.

To associate MySQL accounts with the FIDO authentication
plugin, see
[Using FIDO Authentication](fido-pluggable-authentication.md#fido-pluggable-authentication-usage "Using FIDO Authentication").

##### Using FIDO Authentication

FIDO authentication typically is used in the context of
multifactor authentication (see
[Section 8.2.18, “Multifactor Authentication”](multifactor-authentication.md "8.2.18 Multifactor Authentication")). This section
shows how to incorporate FIDO device-based authentication into
a multifactor account, using the
`authentication_fido` plugin.

It is assumed in the following discussion that the server is
running with the server-side FIDO authentication plugin
enabled, as described in
[Installing FIDO Pluggable Authentication](fido-pluggable-authentication.md#fido-pluggable-authentication-installation "Installing FIDO Pluggable Authentication"),
and that the client-side FIDO plugin is available in the
plugin directory on the client host.

Note

On Windows, FIDO authentication functions only if the client
process runs as a user with administrator privileges.

It is also assumed that FIDO authentication is used in
conjunction with non-FIDO authentication (which implies a 2FA
or 3FA account). FIDO can also be used by itself to create 1FA
accounts that authenticate in a passwordless manner. In this
case, the setup process differs somewhat. For instructions,
see
[FIDO Passwordless Authentication](fido-pluggable-authentication.md#fido-pluggable-authentication-passwordless "FIDO Passwordless Authentication").

An account that is configured to use the
`authentication_fido` plugin is associated
with a FIDO device. Because of this, a one-time device
registration step is required before FIDO authentication can
occur. The device registration process has these
characteristics:

- Any FIDO device associated with an account must be
  registered before the account can be used.
- Registration requires that a FIDO device be available on
  the client host, or registration fails.
- The user is expected to perform the appropriate FIDO
  device action when prompted during registration (for
  example, touching the device or performing a biometric
  scan).
- To perform device registration, the client user must
  invoke the [**mysql**](mysql.md "6.5.1 mysql — The MySQL Command-Line Client") client program or
  MySQL Shell and specify the
  [`--fido-register-factor`](mysql-command-options.md#option_mysql_fido-register-factor)
  option to specify the factor or factors for which a device
  is being registered. For example, if the account is set to
  use FIDO as the second authentication factor, the user
  invokes [**mysql**](mysql.md "6.5.1 mysql — The MySQL Command-Line Client") with the
  [`--fido-register-factor=2`](mysql-command-options.md#option_mysql_fido-register-factor)
  option.
- If the user account is configured with the
  `authentication_fido` plugin set as the
  second or third factor, authentication for all preceding
  factors must succeed before the registration step can
  proceed.
- The server knows from the information in the user account
  whether the FIDO device requires registration or has
  already been registered. When the client program connects,
  the server places the client session in sandbox mode if
  the device must be registered, so that registration must
  occur before anything else can be done. Sandbox mode used
  for FIDO device registration is similar to that used for
  handling of expired passwords. See
  [Section 8.2.16, “Server Handling of Expired Passwords”](expired-password-handling.md "8.2.16 Server Handling of Expired Passwords").
- In sandbox mode, no statements other than
  [`ALTER USER`](alter-user.md "15.7.1.1 ALTER USER Statement") are permitted.
  Registration is performed using forms of this statement.
  When invoked with the
  [`--fido-register-factor`](mysql-command-options.md#option_mysql_fido-register-factor)
  option, the [**mysql**](mysql.md "6.5.1 mysql — The MySQL Command-Line Client") client generates the
  [`ALTER USER`](alter-user.md "15.7.1.1 ALTER USER Statement") statements
  required to perform registration. After registration has
  been accomplished, the server switches the session out of
  sandbox mode, and the client can proceed normally. For
  information about the generated [`ALTER
  USER`](alter-user.md "15.7.1.1 ALTER USER Statement") statements, refer to the
  [`--fido-register-factor`](mysql-command-options.md#option_mysql_fido-register-factor)
  description.
- When device registration has been performed for the
  account, the server updates the
  `mysql.user` system table row for that
  account to update the device registration status and to
  store the public key and credential ID.
- The registration step can be performed only by the user
  named by the account. If one user attempts to perform
  registration for another user, an error occurs.
- The user should use the same FIDO device during
  registration and authentication. If, after registering a
  FIDO device on the client host, the device is reset or a
  different device is inserted, authentication fails. In
  this case, the device associated with the account must be
  unregistered and registration must be done again.

Suppose that you want an account to authenticate first using
the `caching_sha2_password` plugin, then
using the `authentication_fido` plugin.
Create a multifactor account using a statement like this:

```sql
CREATE USER 'u2'@'localhost'
  IDENTIFIED WITH caching_sha2_password
    BY 'sha2_password'
  AND IDENTIFIED WITH authentication_fido;
```

To connect, supply the factor 1 password to satisfy
authentication for that factor, and to initiate registration
of the FIDO device, set the
[`--fido-register-factor`](mysql-command-options.md#option_mysql_fido-register-factor) to factor
2.

```terminal
$> mysql --user=u2 --password1 --fido-register-factor=2
Enter password: (enter factor 1 password)
```

Once the factor 1 password is accepted, the client session
enters sandbox mode so that device registration can be
performed for factor 2. During registration, you are prompted
to perform the appropriate FIDO device action, such as
touching the device or performing a biometric scan.

When the registration process is complete, the connection to
the server is permitted.

Note

The connection to the server is permitted following
registration regardless of additional authentication factors
in the account's authentication chain. For example, if
the account in the preceding example was defined with a
third authentication factor (using non-FIDO authentication),
the connection would be permitted after a successful
registration without authenticating the third factor.
However, subsequent connections would require authenticating
all three factors.

##### FIDO Passwordless Authentication

This section describes how FIDO can be used by itself to
create 1FA accounts that authenticate in a passwordless
manner. In this context, “passwordless” means
that authentication occurs but uses a method other than a
password, such as a security key or biometric scan. It does
not refer to an account that uses a password-based
authentication plugin for which the password is empty. That
kind of “passwordless” is completely insecure and
is not recommended.

The following prerequisites apply when using the
`authentication_fido` plugin to achieve
passwordless authentication:

- The user that creates a passwordless-authentication
  account requires the
  [`PASSWORDLESS_USER_ADMIN`](privileges-provided.md#priv_passwordless-user-admin)
  privilege in addition to the [`CREATE
  USER`](privileges-provided.md#priv_create-user) privilege.
- The first element of the
  [`authentication_policy`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_authentication_policy)
  value must be an asterisk (`*`) and not a
  plugin name. For example, the default
  [`authentication_policy`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_authentication_policy)
  value supports enabling passwordless authentication
  because the first element is an asterisk:

  ```ini
  authentication_policy='*,,'
  ```

  For information about configuring the
  [`authentication_policy`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_authentication_policy)
  value, see
  [Configuring the Multifactor Authentication Policy](multifactor-authentication.md#multifactor-authentication-policy "Configuring the Multifactor Authentication Policy").

To use `authentication_fido` as a
passwordless authentication method, the account must be
created with `authentication_fido` as the
first factor authentication method. The `INITIAL
AUTHENTICATION IDENTIFIED BY` clause must also be
specified for the first factor (it is not supported with 2nd
or 3rd factors). This clause specifies whether a randomly
generated or user-specified password will be used for FIDO
device registration. After device registration, the server
deletes the password and modifies the account to make
`authentication_fido` the sole authentication
method (the 1FA method).

The required [`CREATE USER`](create-user.md "15.7.1.3 CREATE USER Statement") syntax
is as follows:

```sql
CREATE USER user
  IDENTIFIED WITH authentication_fido
  INITIAL AUTHENTICATION IDENTIFIED BY {RANDOM PASSWORD | 'auth_string'};
```

The following example uses the `RANDOM
PASSWORD` syntax:

```sql
mysql> CREATE USER 'u1'@'localhost'
         IDENTIFIED WITH authentication_fido
         INITIAL AUTHENTICATION IDENTIFIED BY RANDOM PASSWORD;
+------+-----------+----------------------+-------------+
| user | host      | generated password   | auth_factor |
+------+-----------+----------------------+-------------+
| u1   | localhost | 9XHK]M{l2rnD;VXyHzeF |           1 |
+------+-----------+----------------------+-------------+
```

To perform registration, the user must authenticate to the
server with the password associated with the `INITIAL
AUTHENTICATION IDENTIFIED BY` clause, either the
randomly generated password, or the
`'auth_string'`
value. If the account was created as just shown, the user
executes this command and pastes in the preceding randomly
generated password (`9XHK]M{l2rnD;VXyHzeF`)
at the prompt:

```terminal
$> mysql --user=u1 --password --fido-register-factor=2
Enter password:
```

The option `--fido-register-factor=2` is used
because the `INITIAL AUTHENTICATION IDENTIFIED
BY` clause is currently acting as the first factor
authentication method. The user must therefore provide the
temporary password by using the second factor. On a successful
registration, the server removes the temporary password and
revises the account entry in the `mysql.user`
system table to list `authentication_fido` as
the sole (1FA) authentication method.

When creating a passwordless-authentication account, it is
important to include the `INITIAL AUTHENTICATION
IDENTIFIED BY` clause in the
[`CREATE USER`](create-user.md "15.7.1.3 CREATE USER Statement") statement. The
server will accept a statement without the clause, but the
resulting account is unusable because there is no way to
connect to the server to register the device. Suppose that you
execute a statement like this:

```sql
CREATE USER 'u2'@'localhost'
  IDENTIFIED WITH authentication_fido;
```

Subsequent attempts to use the account to connect fail like
this:

```terminal
$> mysql --user=u2 --skip-password
Failed to open FIDO device.
ERROR 1 (HY000): Unknown MySQL error
```

Note

Passwordless authentication is achieved using the Universal
2nd Factor (U2F) protocol, which does not support additional
security measures such as setting a PIN on the device to be
registered. It is therefore the responsibility of the device
holder to ensure the device is handled in a secure manner.

##### FIDO Device Unregistration

It is possible to unregister FIDO devices associated with a
MySQL account. This might be desirable or necessary under
multiple circumstances:

- A FIDO device is to be replaced with a different device.
  The previous device must be unregistered and the new
  device registered.

  In this case, the account owner or any user who has the
  [`CREATE USER`](privileges-provided.md#priv_create-user) privilege can
  unregister the device. The account owner can register the
  new device.
- A FIDO device is reset or lost. Authentication attempts
  will fail until the current device is unregistered and a
  new registration is performed.

  In this case, the account owner, being unable to
  authenticate, cannot unregister the current device and
  must contact the DBA (or any user who has the
  [`CREATE USER`](privileges-provided.md#priv_create-user) privilege) to
  do so. Then the account owner can reregister the reset
  device or register a new device.

Unregistering a FIDO device can be done by the account owner
or by any user who has the [`CREATE
USER`](create-user.md "15.7.1.3 CREATE USER Statement") privilege. Use this syntax:

```sql
ALTER USER user {2 | 3} FACTOR UNREGISTER;
```

To re-register a device or perform a new registration, refer
to the instructions in
[Using FIDO Authentication](fido-pluggable-authentication.md#fido-pluggable-authentication-usage "Using FIDO Authentication").

##### How FIDO Authentication of MySQL Users Works

This section provides an overview of how MySQL and FIDO work
together to authenticate MySQL users. For examples showing how
to set up MySQL accounts to use the FIDO authentication
plugins, see
[Using FIDO Authentication](fido-pluggable-authentication.md#fido-pluggable-authentication-usage "Using FIDO Authentication").

An account that uses FIDO authentication must perform an
initial device registration step before it can connect to the
server. After the device has been registered, authentication
can proceed. FIDO device registration process is as follows:

1. The server sends a random challenge, user ID, and relying
   party ID (which uniquely identifies a server) to the
   client. The relying party ID is defined by the
   [`authentication_fido_rp_id`](pluggable-authentication-system-variables.md#sysvar_authentication_fido_rp_id)
   system variable. The default value is
   `MySQL`.
2. The client receives that information and sends it to the
   client-side FIDO authentication plugin, which in turn
   provides it to the FIDO device.
3. After the user has performed the appropriate device action
   (for example, touching the device or performing a
   biometric scan) the FIDO device generates a public/private
   key pair, a key handle, an X.509 certificate, and a
   signature, which is returned to the server.
4. The server-side FIDO authentication plugin verifies the
   signature. Upon successful verification, the server stores
   the credential ID and public key in the
   `mysql.user` system table.

After registration has been performed successfully, FIDO
authentication follows this process:

1. The server sends a random challenge, user ID, relying
   party ID and credentials to the client.
2. The client sends the same information to the FIDO device.
3. The FIDO device prompts the user to perform the
   appropriate device action, based on the selection made
   during registration.
4. This action unlocks the private key and the challenge is
   signed.
5. This signed challenge is returned to the server.
6. The server-side FIDO authentication plugin verifies the
   signature with the public key and responds to indicate
   authentication success or failure.
