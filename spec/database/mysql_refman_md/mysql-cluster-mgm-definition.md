#### 25.4.3.5 Defining an NDB Cluster Management Server

The `[ndb_mgmd]` section is used to configure
the behavior of the management server. If multiple management
servers are employed, you can specify parameters common to all
of them in an `[ndb_mgmd default]` section.
`[mgm]` and `[mgm default]`
are older aliases for these, supported for backward
compatibility.

All parameters in the following list are optional and assume
their default values if omitted.

Note

If neither the `ExecuteOnComputer` nor the
`HostName` parameter is present, the default
value `localhost` is assumed for both.

- `Id`

  |  |  |
  | --- | --- |
  | Version (or later) | NDB 8.0.13 |
  | Type or units | unsigned |
  | Default | [...] |
  | Range | 1 - 255 |
  | Restart Type | **Initial System Restart:**Requires a complete shutdown of the cluster, wiping and restoring the cluster file system from a [backup](mysql-cluster-backup.md "25.6.8 Online Backup of NDB Cluster"), and then restarting the cluster. (NDB 8.0.13) |

  Each node in the cluster has a unique identity. For a
  management node, this is represented by an integer value in
  the range 1 to 255, inclusive. This ID is used by all
  internal cluster messages for addressing the node, and so
  must be unique for each NDB Cluster node, regardless of the
  type of node.

  Note

  Data node IDs must be less than 145. If you plan to deploy
  a large number of data nodes, it is a good idea to limit
  the node IDs for management nodes (and API nodes) to
  values greater than 144.

  The use of the `Id` parameter for
  identifying management nodes is deprecated in favor of
  [`NodeId`](mysql-cluster-mgm-definition.md#ndbparam-mgmd-nodeid). Although
  `Id` continues to be supported for backward
  compatibility, it now generates a warning and is subject to
  removal in a future version of NDB Cluster.
- `NodeId`

  |  |  |
  | --- | --- |
  | Version (or later) | NDB 8.0.13 |
  | Type or units | unsigned |
  | Default | [...] |
  | Range | 1 - 255 |
  | Restart Type | **Initial System Restart:**Requires a complete shutdown of the cluster, wiping and restoring the cluster file system from a [backup](mysql-cluster-backup.md "25.6.8 Online Backup of NDB Cluster"), and then restarting the cluster. (NDB 8.0.13) |

  Each node in the cluster has a unique identity. For a
  management node, this is represented by an integer value in
  the range 1 to 255 inclusive. This ID is used by all
  internal cluster messages for addressing the node, and so
  must be unique for each NDB Cluster node, regardless of the
  type of node.

  Note

  Data node IDs must be less than 145. If you plan to deploy
  a large number of data nodes, it is a good idea to limit
  the node IDs for management nodes (and API nodes) to
  values greater than 144.

  `NodeId` is the preferred parameter name to
  use when identifying management nodes. Although the older
  [`Id`](mysql-cluster-mgm-definition.md#ndbparam-mgmd-id) continues to be
  supported for backward compatibility, it is now deprecated
  and generates a warning when used; it is also subject to
  removal in a future NDB Cluster release.
- `ExecuteOnComputer`

  |  |  |
  | --- | --- |
  | Version (or later) | NDB 8.0.13 |
  | Type or units | name |
  | Default | [...] |
  | Range | ... |
  | Deprecated | Yes (in NDB 7.5) |
  | Restart Type | **System Restart:**Requires a complete shutdown and restart of the cluster. (NDB 8.0.13) |

  This refers to the `Id` set for one of the
  computers defined in a `[computer]` section
  of the `config.ini` file.

  Important

  This parameter is deprecated, and is subject to removal in
  a future release. Use the
  [`HostName`](mysql-cluster-mgm-definition.md#ndbparam-mgmd-hostname) parameter
  instead.
- `PortNumber`

  |  |  |
  | --- | --- |
  | Version (or later) | NDB 8.0.13 |
  | Type or units | unsigned |
  | Default | 1186 |
  | Range | 0 - 64K |
  | Restart Type | **System Restart:**Requires a complete shutdown and restart of the cluster. (NDB 8.0.13) |

  This is the port number on which the management server
  listens for configuration requests and management commands.
- The node ID for this node can be given out only to
  connections that explicitly request it. A management server
  that requests “any” node ID cannot use this
  one. This parameter can be used when running multiple
  management servers on the same host, and
  [`HostName`](mysql-cluster-mgm-definition.md#ndbparam-mgmd-hostname) is not
  sufficient for distinguishing among processes.
- `HostName`

  |  |  |
  | --- | --- |
  | Version (or later) | NDB 8.0.13 |
  | Type or units | name or IP address |
  | Default | [...] |
  | Range | ... |
  | Restart Type | **Node Restart:**Requires a [rolling restart](mysql-cluster-rolling-restart.md "25.6.5 Performing a Rolling Restart of an NDB Cluster") of the cluster. (NDB 8.0.13) |

  Specifying this parameter defines the host name of the
  computer on which the management node is to reside. Use
  `HostName` to specify a host name other
  than `localhost`.
- [`LocationDomainId`](mysql-cluster-mgm-definition.md#ndbparam-mgmd-locationdomainid)

  |  |  |
  | --- | --- |
  | Version (or later) | NDB 8.0.13 |
  | Type or units | integer |
  | Default | 0 |
  | Range | 0 - 16 |
  | Restart Type | **System Restart:**Requires a complete shutdown and restart of the cluster. (NDB 8.0.13) |

  Assigns a management node to a specific
  [availability
  domain](https://docs.us-phoenix-1.oraclecloud.com/Content/General/Concepts/regions.htm) (also known as an availability zone) within a
  cloud. By informing `NDB` which nodes are
  in which availability domains, performance can be improved
  in a cloud environment in the following ways:

  - If requested data is not found on the same node, reads
    can be directed to another node in the same availability
    domain.
  - Communication between nodes in different availability
    domains are guaranteed to use `NDB`
    transporters' WAN support without any further
    manual intervention.
  - The transporter's group number can be based on
    which availability domain is used, such that also SQL
    and other API nodes communicate with local data nodes in
    the same availability domain whenever possible.
  - The arbitrator can be selected from an availability
    domain in which no data nodes are present, or, if no
    such availability domain can be found, from a third
    availability domain.

  `LocationDomainId` takes an integer value
  between 0 and 16 inclusive, with 0 being the default; using
  0 is the same as leaving the parameter unset.
- [`LogDestination`](mysql-cluster-mgm-definition.md#ndbparam-mgmd-logdestination)

  |  |  |
  | --- | --- |
  | Version (or later) | NDB 8.0.13 |
  | Type or units | {CONSOLE|SYSLOG|FILE} |
  | Default | FILE: filename=ndb\_nodeid\_cluster.log, maxsize=1000000, maxfiles=6 |
  | Range | ... |
  | Restart Type | **Node Restart:**Requires a [rolling restart](mysql-cluster-rolling-restart.md "25.6.5 Performing a Rolling Restart of an NDB Cluster") of the cluster. (NDB 8.0.13) |

  This parameter specifies where to send cluster logging
  information. There are three options in this
  regard—`CONSOLE`,
  `SYSLOG`, and
  `FILE`—with `FILE`
  being the default:

  - `CONSOLE` outputs the log to
    `stdout`:

    ```simple
    CONSOLE
    ```
  - `SYSLOG` sends the log to a
    `syslog` facility, possible values
    being one of `auth`,
    `authpriv`, `cron`,
    `daemon`, `ftp`,
    `kern`, `lpr`,
    `mail`, `news`,
    `syslog`, `user`,
    `uucp`, `local0`,
    `local1`, `local2`,
    `local3`, `local4`,
    `local5`, `local6`, or
    `local7`.

    Note

    Not every facility is necessarily supported by every
    operating system.

    ```simple
    SYSLOG:facility=syslog
    ```
  - `FILE` pipes the cluster log output to
    a regular file on the same machine. The following values
    can be specified:

    - `filename`: The name of the log
      file.

      The default log file name used in such cases is
      `ndb_nodeid_cluster.log`.
    - `maxsize`: The maximum size (in
      bytes) to which the file can grow before logging
      rolls over to a new file. When this occurs, the old
      log file is renamed by appending
      *`.N`* to the file name,
      where *`N`* is the next
      number not yet used with this name.
    - `maxfiles`: The maximum number of
      log files.

    ```simple
    FILE:filename=cluster.log,maxsize=1000000,maxfiles=6
    ```

    The default value for the `FILE`
    parameter is
    `FILE:filename=ndb_node_id_cluster.log,maxsize=1000000,maxfiles=6`,
    where *`node_id`* is the ID of
    the node.

  It is possible to specify multiple log destinations
  separated by semicolons as shown here:

  ```simple
  CONSOLE;SYSLOG:facility=local0;FILE:filename=/var/log/mgmd
  ```
- `ArbitrationRank`

  |  |  |
  | --- | --- |
  | Version (or later) | NDB 8.0.13 |
  | Type or units | 0-2 |
  | Default | 1 |
  | Range | 0 - 2 |
  | Restart Type | **Node Restart:**Requires a [rolling restart](mysql-cluster-rolling-restart.md "25.6.5 Performing a Rolling Restart of an NDB Cluster") of the cluster. (NDB 8.0.13) |

  This parameter is used to define which nodes can act as
  arbitrators. Only management nodes and SQL nodes can be
  arbitrators. `ArbitrationRank` can take one
  of the following values:

  - `0`: The node is never used as an
    arbitrator.
  - `1`: The node has high priority; that
    is, it is preferred as an arbitrator over low-priority
    nodes.
  - `2`: Indicates a low-priority node
    which is used as an arbitrator only if a node with a
    higher priority is not available for that purpose.

  Normally, the management server should be configured as an
  arbitrator by setting its `ArbitrationRank`
  to 1 (the default for management nodes) and those for all
  SQL nodes to 0 (the default for SQL nodes).

  You can disable arbitration completely either by setting
  `ArbitrationRank` to 0 on all management
  and SQL nodes, or by setting the
  [`Arbitration`](mysql-cluster-ndbd-definition.md#ndbparam-ndbd-arbitration)
  parameter in the `[ndbd default]` section
  of the `config.ini` global configuration
  file. Setting
  [`Arbitration`](mysql-cluster-ndbd-definition.md#ndbparam-ndbd-arbitration) causes
  any settings for `ArbitrationRank` to be
  disregarded.
- `ArbitrationDelay`

  |  |  |
  | --- | --- |
  | Version (or later) | NDB 8.0.13 |
  | Type or units | milliseconds |
  | Default | 0 |
  | Range | 0 - 4294967039 (0xFFFFFEFF) |
  | Restart Type | **Node Restart:**Requires a [rolling restart](mysql-cluster-rolling-restart.md "25.6.5 Performing a Rolling Restart of an NDB Cluster") of the cluster. (NDB 8.0.13) |

  An integer value which causes the management server's
  responses to arbitration requests to be delayed by that
  number of milliseconds. By default, this value is 0; it is
  normally not necessary to change it.
- `DataDir`

  |  |  |
  | --- | --- |
  | Version (or later) | NDB 8.0.13 |
  | Type or units | path |
  | Default | . |
  | Range | ... |
  | Restart Type | **Node Restart:**Requires a [rolling restart](mysql-cluster-rolling-restart.md "25.6.5 Performing a Rolling Restart of an NDB Cluster") of the cluster. (NDB 8.0.13) |

  This specifies the directory where output files from the
  management server are placed. These files include cluster
  log files, process output files, and the daemon's
  process ID (PID) file. (For log files, this location can be
  overridden by setting the `FILE` parameter
  for [`LogDestination`](mysql-cluster-mgm-definition.md#ndbparam-mgmd-logdestination),
  as discussed previously in this section.)

  The default value for this parameter is the directory in
  which [**ndb\_mgmd**](mysql-cluster-programs-ndb-mgmd.md "25.5.4 ndb_mgmd — The NDB Cluster Management Server Daemon") is located.
- `PortNumberStats`

  |  |  |
  | --- | --- |
  | Version (or later) | NDB 8.0.13 |
  | Type or units | unsigned |
  | Default | [...] |
  | Range | 0 - 64K |
  | Restart Type | **Node Restart:**Requires a [rolling restart](mysql-cluster-rolling-restart.md "25.6.5 Performing a Rolling Restart of an NDB Cluster") of the cluster. (NDB 8.0.13) |

  This parameter specifies the port number used to obtain
  statistical information from an NDB Cluster management
  server. It has no default value.
- [`Wan`](mysql-cluster-mgm-definition.md#ndbparam-mgmd-wan)

  |  |  |
  | --- | --- |
  | Version (or later) | NDB 8.0.13 |
  | Type or units | boolean |
  | Default | false |
  | Range | true, false |
  | Restart Type | **Node Restart:**Requires a [rolling restart](mysql-cluster-rolling-restart.md "25.6.5 Performing a Rolling Restart of an NDB Cluster") of the cluster. (NDB 8.0.13) |

  Use WAN TCP setting as default.
- `HeartbeatThreadPriority`

  |  |  |
  | --- | --- |
  | Version (or later) | NDB 8.0.13 |
  | Type or units | string |
  | Default | [...] |
  | Range | ... |
  | Restart Type | **Node Restart:**Requires a [rolling restart](mysql-cluster-rolling-restart.md "25.6.5 Performing a Rolling Restart of an NDB Cluster") of the cluster. (NDB 8.0.13) |

  Set the scheduling policy and priority of heartbeat threads
  for management and API nodes.

  The syntax for setting this parameter is shown here:

  ```ini
  HeartbeatThreadPriority = policy[, priority]

  policy:
    {FIFO | RR}
  ```

  When setting this parameter, you must specify a policy. This
  is one of `FIFO` (first in, first out) or
  `RR` (round robin). The policy value is
  followed optionally by the priority (an integer).
- `ExtraSendBufferMemory`

  |  |  |
  | --- | --- |
  | Version (or later) | NDB 8.0.13 |
  | Type or units | bytes |
  | Default | 0 |
  | Range | 0 - 32G |
  | Restart Type | **Node Restart:**Requires a [rolling restart](mysql-cluster-rolling-restart.md "25.6.5 Performing a Rolling Restart of an NDB Cluster") of the cluster. (NDB 8.0.13) |

  This parameter specifies the amount of transporter send
  buffer memory to allocate in addition to any that has been
  set using
  [`TotalSendBufferMemory`](mysql-cluster-mgm-definition.md#ndbparam-mgmd-totalsendbuffermemory),
  [`SendBufferMemory`](mysql-cluster-tcp-definition.md#ndbparam-tcp-sendbuffermemory), or
  both.
- `TotalSendBufferMemory`

  |  |  |
  | --- | --- |
  | Version (or later) | NDB 8.0.13 |
  | Type or units | bytes |
  | Default | 0 |
  | Range | 256K - 4294967039 (0xFFFFFEFF) |
  | Restart Type | **Node Restart:**Requires a [rolling restart](mysql-cluster-rolling-restart.md "25.6.5 Performing a Rolling Restart of an NDB Cluster") of the cluster. (NDB 8.0.13) |

  This parameter is used to determine the total amount of
  memory to allocate on this node for shared send buffer
  memory among all configured transporters.

  If this parameter is set, its minimum permitted value is
  256KB; 0 indicates that the parameter has not been set. For
  more detailed information, see
  [Section 25.4.3.14, “Configuring NDB Cluster Send Buffer Parameters”](mysql-cluster-config-send-buffers.md "25.4.3.14 Configuring NDB Cluster Send Buffer Parameters").
- `HeartbeatIntervalMgmdMgmd`

  |  |  |
  | --- | --- |
  | Version (or later) | NDB 8.0.13 |
  | Type or units | milliseconds |
  | Default | 1500 |
  | Range | 100 - 4294967039 (0xFFFFFEFF) |
  | Restart Type | **Node Restart:**Requires a [rolling restart](mysql-cluster-rolling-restart.md "25.6.5 Performing a Rolling Restart of an NDB Cluster") of the cluster. (NDB 8.0.13) |

  Specify the interval between heartbeat messages used to
  determine whether another management node is on contact with
  this one. The management node waits after 3 of these
  intervals to declare the connection dead; thus, the default
  setting of 1500 milliseconds causes the management node to
  wait for approximately 1600 ms before timing out.

Note

After making changes in a management node's
configuration, it is necessary to perform a rolling restart of
the cluster for the new configuration to take effect.

To add new management servers to a running NDB Cluster, it is
also necessary to perform a rolling restart of all cluster
nodes after modifying any existing
`config.ini` files. For more information
about issues arising when using multiple management nodes, see
[Section 25.2.7.10, “Limitations Relating to Multiple NDB Cluster Nodes”](mysql-cluster-limitations-multiple-nodes.md "25.2.7.10 Limitations Relating to Multiple NDB Cluster Nodes").

**Restart types.**
Information about the restart types used by the parameter
descriptions in this section is shown in the following table:

**Table 25.9 NDB Cluster restart types**

| Symbol | Restart Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| N | Node | The parameter can be updated using a rolling restart (see [Section 25.6.5, “Performing a Rolling Restart of an NDB Cluster”](mysql-cluster-rolling-restart.md "25.6.5 Performing a Rolling Restart of an NDB Cluster")) |
| S | System | All cluster nodes must be shut down completely, then restarted, to effect a change in this parameter |
| I | Initial | Data nodes must be restarted using the [`--initial`](mysql-cluster-programs-ndbd.md#option_ndbd_initial) option |
