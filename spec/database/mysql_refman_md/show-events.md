#### 15.7.7.18 SHOW EVENTS Statement

```sql
SHOW EVENTS
    [{FROM | IN} schema_name]
    [LIKE 'pattern' | WHERE expr]
```

This statement displays information about Event Manager events,
which are discussed in [Section 27.4, “Using the Event Scheduler”](event-scheduler.md "27.4 Using the Event Scheduler"). It
requires the [`EVENT`](privileges-provided.md#priv_event) privilege for
the database from which the events are to be shown.

In its simplest form, [`SHOW EVENTS`](show-events.md "15.7.7.18 SHOW EVENTS Statement")
lists all of the events in the current schema:

```sql
mysql> SELECT CURRENT_USER(), SCHEMA();
+----------------+----------+
| CURRENT_USER() | SCHEMA() |
+----------------+----------+
| jon@ghidora    | myschema |
+----------------+----------+
1 row in set (0.00 sec)

mysql> SHOW EVENTS\G
*************************** 1. row ***************************
                  Db: myschema
                Name: e_daily
             Definer: jon@ghidora
           Time zone: SYSTEM
                Type: RECURRING
          Execute at: NULL
      Interval value: 1
      Interval field: DAY
              Starts: 2018-08-08 11:06:34
                Ends: NULL
              Status: ENABLED
          Originator: 1
character_set_client: utf8mb4
collation_connection: utf8mb4_0900_ai_ci
  Database Collation: utf8mb4_0900_ai_ci
```

To see events for a specific schema, use the
`FROM` clause. For example, to see events for
the `test` schema, use the following statement:

```sql
SHOW EVENTS FROM test;
```

The [`LIKE`](string-comparison-functions.md#operator_like) clause, if present,
indicates which event names to match. The
`WHERE` clause can be given to select rows
using more general conditions, as discussed in
[Section 28.8, “Extensions to SHOW Statements”](extended-show.md "28.8 Extensions to SHOW Statements").

[`SHOW EVENTS`](show-events.md "15.7.7.18 SHOW EVENTS Statement") output has these
columns:

- `Db`

  The name of the schema (database) to which the event
  belongs.
- `Name`

  The name of the event.
- `Definer`

  The account of the user who created the event, in
  `'user_name'@'host_name'`
  format.
- `Time zone`

  The event time zone, which is the time zone used for
  scheduling the event and that is in effect within the event
  as it executes. The default value is
  `SYSTEM`.
- `Type`

  The event repetition type, either `ONE
  TIME` (transient) or `RECURRING`
  (repeating).
- `Execute At`

  For a one-time event, this is the
  [`DATETIME`](datetime.md "13.2.2 The DATE, DATETIME, and TIMESTAMP Types") value specified in
  the `AT` clause of the
  [`CREATE EVENT`](create-event.md "15.1.13 CREATE EVENT Statement") statement used
  to create the event, or of the last
  [`ALTER EVENT`](alter-event.md "15.1.3 ALTER EVENT Statement") statement that
  modified the event. The value shown in this column reflects
  the addition or subtraction of any
  `INTERVAL` value included in the event's
  `AT` clause. For example, if an event is
  created using `ON SCHEDULE AT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP +
  '1:6' DAY_HOUR`, and the event was created at
  2018-02-09 14:05:30, the value shown in this column would be
  `'2018-02-10 20:05:30'`. If the event's
  timing is determined by an `EVERY` clause
  instead of an `AT` clause (that is, if the
  event is recurring), the value of this column is
  `NULL`.
- `Interval Value`

  For a recurring event, the number of intervals to wait
  between event executions. For a transient event, the value
  of this column is always `NULL`.
- `Interval Field`

  The time units used for the interval which a recurring event
  waits before repeating. For a transient event, the value of
  this column is always `NULL`.
- `Starts`

  The start date and time for a recurring event. This is
  displayed as a [`DATETIME`](datetime.md "13.2.2 The DATE, DATETIME, and TIMESTAMP Types")
  value, and is `NULL` if no start date and
  time are defined for the event. For a transient event, this
  column is always `NULL`. For a recurring
  event whose definition includes a `STARTS`
  clause, this column contains the corresponding
  [`DATETIME`](datetime.md "13.2.2 The DATE, DATETIME, and TIMESTAMP Types") value. As with the
  `Execute At` column, this value resolves
  any expressions used. If there is no
  `STARTS` clause affecting the timing of the
  event, this column is `NULL`
- `Ends`

  For a recurring event whose definition includes a
  `ENDS` clause, this column contains the
  corresponding [`DATETIME`](datetime.md "13.2.2 The DATE, DATETIME, and TIMESTAMP Types") value.
  As with the `Execute At` column, this value
  resolves any expressions used. If there is no
  `ENDS` clause affecting the timing of the
  event, this column is `NULL`.
- `Status`

  The event status. One of `ENABLED`,
  `DISABLED`, or
  `SLAVESIDE_DISABLED`.
  `SLAVESIDE_DISABLED` indicates that the
  creation of the event occurred on another MySQL server
  acting as a replication source and replicated to the current
  MySQL server which is acting as a replica, but the event is
  not presently being executed on the replica. For more
  information, see
  [Section 19.5.1.16, “Replication of Invoked Features”](replication-features-invoked.md "19.5.1.16 Replication of Invoked Features"). information.
- `Originator`

  The server ID of the MySQL server on which the event was
  created; used in replication. This value may be updated by
  [`ALTER EVENT`](alter-event.md "15.1.3 ALTER EVENT Statement") to the server ID
  of the server on which that statement occurs, if executed on
  a source server. The default value is 0.
- `character_set_client`

  The session value of the
  [`character_set_client`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_character_set_client) system
  variable when the event was created.
- `collation_connection`

  The session value of the
  [`collation_connection`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_collation_connection) system
  variable when the event was created.
- `Database Collation`

  The collation of the database with which the event is
  associated.

For more information about `SLAVESIDE_DISABLED`
and the `Originator` column, see
[Section 19.5.1.16, “Replication of Invoked Features”](replication-features-invoked.md "19.5.1.16 Replication of Invoked Features").

Times displayed by [`SHOW EVENTS`](show-events.md "15.7.7.18 SHOW EVENTS Statement")
are given in the event time zone, as discussed in
[Section 27.4.4, “Event Metadata”](events-metadata.md "27.4.4 Event Metadata").

Event information is also available from the
`INFORMATION_SCHEMA`
[`EVENTS`](information-schema-events-table.md "28.3.14 The INFORMATION_SCHEMA EVENTS Table") table. See
[Section 28.3.14, “The INFORMATION\_SCHEMA EVENTS Table”](information-schema-events-table.md "28.3.14 The INFORMATION_SCHEMA EVENTS Table").

The event action statement is not shown in the output of
[`SHOW EVENTS`](show-events.md "15.7.7.18 SHOW EVENTS Statement"). Use
[`SHOW CREATE EVENT`](show-create-event.md "15.7.7.7 SHOW CREATE EVENT Statement") or the
`INFORMATION_SCHEMA`
[`EVENTS`](information-schema-events-table.md "28.3.14 The INFORMATION_SCHEMA EVENTS Table") table.
