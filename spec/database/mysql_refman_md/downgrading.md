# Chapter 4 Downgrading MySQL

Downgrading from MySQL 8.0 to MySQL 5.7 is not supported.

In-place downgrades are supported from within the MySQL 8.0 series
as of MySQL 8.0.35. In-place means starting and running a new MySQL
server binary on an existing MySQL data directory that was created
by a different MySQL server version.

Attempting to downgrade below MySQL 8.0.35 yields an error similar
to:

```terminal
[ERROR] [MY-013171] [InnoDB] Cannot boot server version 80034 on data directory built by version 80035. Downgrade is not supported
```

Here's a successful log message from an in-place MySQL 8.0.36 to
8.0.35 downgrade:

```terminal
[System] [MY-014064] [Server] Server downgrade from '80036' to '80035' started.
[System] [MY-014064] [Server] Server downgrade from '80036' to '80035' completed.
```

An alternative is to restore a backup taken
*before* an upgrade.
