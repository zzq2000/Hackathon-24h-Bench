#### 12.14.4.3 Diagnostics During Index.xml Parsing

The MySQL server generates diagnostics when it finds problems
while parsing the `Index.xml` file:

- Unknown tags are written to the error log. For example,
  the following message results if a collation definition
  contains a `<aaa>` tag:

  ```none
  [Warning] Buffered warning: Unknown LDML tag:
  'charsets/charset/collation/rules/aaa'
  ```
- If collation initialization is not possible, the server
  reports an “Unknown collation” error, and
  also generates warnings explaining the problems, such as
  in the previous example. In other cases, when a collation
  description is generally correct but contains some unknown
  tags, the collation is initialized and is available for
  use. The unknown parts are ignored, but a warning is
  generated in the error log.
- Problems with collations generate warnings that clients
  can display with [`SHOW
  WARNINGS`](show-warnings.md "15.7.7.42 SHOW WARNINGS Statement"). Suppose that a reset rule contains an
  expansion longer than the maximum supported length of 6
  characters:

  ```xml
  <reset>abcdefghi</reset>
  <i>x</i>
  ```

  An attempt to use the collation produces warnings:

  ```sql
  mysql> SELECT _utf8mb4'test' COLLATE utf8mb4_test_ci;
  ERROR 1273 (HY000): Unknown collation: 'utf8mb4_test_ci'
  mysql> SHOW WARNINGS;
  +---------+------+----------------------------------------+
  | Level   | Code | Message                                |
  +---------+------+----------------------------------------+
  | Error   | 1273 | Unknown collation: 'utf8mb4_test_ci'   |
  | Warning | 1273 | Expansion is too long at 'abcdefghi=x' |
  +---------+------+----------------------------------------+
  ```
