#### 12.10.7.2 The gb18030 Character Set

In MySQL, the `gb18030` character set
corresponds to the “Chinese National Standard GB
18030-2005: Information technology — Chinese coded
character set”, which is the official character set of
the People's Republic of China (PRC).

##### Characteristics of the MySQL gb18030 Character Set

- Supports all code points defined by the GB 18030-2005
  standard. Unassigned code points in the ranges
  (GB+8431A439, GB+90308130) and (GB+E3329A36, GB+EF39EF39)
  are treated as '`?`' (0x3F). Conversion
  of unassigned code points return '`?`'.
- Supports UPPER and LOWER conversion for all GB18030 code
  points. Case folding defined by Unicode is also supported
  (based on `CaseFolding-6.3.0.txt`).
- Supports Conversion of data to and from other character
  sets.
- Supports SQL statements such as [`SET
  NAMES`](set-names.md "15.7.6.3 SET NAMES Statement").
- Supports comparison between `gb18030`
  strings, and between `gb18030` strings
  and strings of other character sets. There is a conversion
  if strings have different character sets. Comparisons that
  include or ignore trailing spaces are also supported.
- The private use area (U+E000, U+F8FF) in Unicode is mapped
  to `gb18030`.
- There is no mapping between (U+D800, U+DFFF) and GB18030.
  Attempted conversion of code points in this range returns
  '`?`'.
- If an incoming sequence is illegal, an error or warning is
  returned. If an illegal sequence is used in
  `CONVERT()`, an error is returned.
  Otherwise, a warning is returned.
- For consistency with `utf8mb3` and
  `utf8mb4`, UPPER is not supported for
  ligatures.
- Searches for ligatures also match uppercase ligatures when
  using the `gb18030_unicode_520_ci`
  collation.
- If a character has more than one uppercase character, the
  chosen uppercase character is the one whose lowercase is
  the character itself.
- The minimum multibyte length is 1 and the maximum is 4.
  The character set determines the length of a sequence
  using the first 1 or 2 bytes.

##### Supported Collations

- `gb18030_bin`: A binary collation.
- `gb18030_chinese_ci`: The default
  collation, which supports Pinyin. Sorting of non-Chinese
  characters is based on the order of the original sort key.
  The original sort key is `GB(UPPER(ch))`
  if `UPPER(ch)` exists. Otherwise, the
  original sort key is `GB(ch)`. Chinese
  characters are sorted according to the Pinyin collation
  defined in the Unicode Common Locale Data Repository (CLDR
  24). Non-Chinese characters are sorted before Chinese
  characters with the exception of
  `GB+FE39FE39`, which is the code point
  maximum.
- `gb18030_unicode_520_ci`: A Unicode
  collation. Use this collation if you need to ensure that
  ligatures are sorted correctly.
