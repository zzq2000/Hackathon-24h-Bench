#### 6.2.2.5 Using Options to Set Program Variables

Many MySQL programs have internal variables that can be set at
runtime using the
[`SET`](set-variable.md "15.7.6.1 SET Syntax for Variable Assignment")
statement. See [Section 15.7.6.1, “SET Syntax for Variable Assignment”](set-variable.md "15.7.6.1 SET Syntax for Variable Assignment"), and
[Section 7.1.9, “Using System Variables”](using-system-variables.md "7.1.9 Using System Variables").

Most of these program variables also can be set at server
startup by using the same syntax that applies to specifying
program options. For example, [**mysql**](mysql.md "6.5.1 mysql — The MySQL Command-Line Client") has a
`max_allowed_packet` variable that controls the
maximum size of its communication buffer. To set the
`max_allowed_packet` variable for
[**mysql**](mysql.md "6.5.1 mysql — The MySQL Command-Line Client") to a value of 16MB, use either of the
following commands:

```terminal
mysql --max_allowed_packet=16777216
mysql --max_allowed_packet=16M
```

The first command specifies the value in bytes. The second
specifies the value in megabytes. For variables that take a
numeric value, the value can be given with a suffix of
`K`, `M`, or
`G` to indicate a multiplier of 1024,
10242 or
10243. (For example, when used to set
`max_allowed_packet`, the suffixes indicate
units of kilobytes, megabytes, or gigabytes.) As of MySQL
8.0.14, a suffix can also be `T`,
`P`, and `E` to indicate a
multiplier of 10244,
10245 or
10246. Suffix letters can be
uppercase or lowercase.

In an option file, variable settings are given without the
leading dashes:

```ini
[mysql]
max_allowed_packet=16777216
```

Or:

```ini
[mysql]
max_allowed_packet=16M
```

If you like, underscores in an option name can be specified as
dashes. The following option groups are equivalent. Both set the
size of the server's key buffer to 512MB:

```ini
[mysqld]
key_buffer_size=512M

[mysqld]
key-buffer-size=512M
```

Suffixes for specifying a value multiplier can be used when
setting a variable at program invocation time, but not to set
the value with
[`SET`](set-variable.md "15.7.6.1 SET Syntax for Variable Assignment") at
runtime. On the other hand, with
[`SET`](set-variable.md "15.7.6.1 SET Syntax for Variable Assignment"), you
can assign a variable's value using an expression, which is not
true when you set a variable at server startup. For example, the
first of the following lines is legal at program invocation
time, but the second is not:

```terminal
$> mysql --max_allowed_packet=16M
$> mysql --max_allowed_packet=16*1024*1024
```

Conversely, the second of the following lines is legal at
runtime, but the first is not:

```sql
mysql> SET GLOBAL max_allowed_packet=16M;
mysql> SET GLOBAL max_allowed_packet=16*1024*1024;
```
