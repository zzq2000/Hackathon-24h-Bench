#### 20.2.1.2 Configuring an Instance for Group Replication

This section explains the configuration settings required for
MySQL Server instances that you want to use for Group
Replication. For background information, see
[Section 20.3, “Requirements and Limitations”](group-replication-requirements-and-limitations.md "20.3 Requirements and Limitations").

- [Storage Engines](group-replication-configuring-instances.md#group-replication-storage-engines "Storage Engines")
- [Replication Framework](group-replication-configuring-instances.md#group-replication-configure-replication-framework "Replication Framework")
- [Group Replication Settings](group-replication-configuring-instances.md#group-replication-configure-plugin "Group Replication Settings")

##### Storage Engines

For Group Replication, data must be stored in the InnoDB
transactional storage engine (for details of why, see
[Section 20.3.1, “Group Replication Requirements”](group-replication-requirements.md "20.3.1 Group Replication Requirements")). The use of
other storage engines, including the temporary
[`MEMORY`](memory-storage-engine.md "18.3 The MEMORY Storage Engine") storage engine, might
cause errors in Group Replication. Set the
[`disabled_storage_engines`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_disabled_storage_engines)
system variable as follows to prevent their use:

```ini
disabled_storage_engines="MyISAM,BLACKHOLE,FEDERATED,ARCHIVE,MEMORY"
```

Note that with the [`MyISAM`](myisam-storage-engine.md "18.2 The MyISAM Storage Engine") storage
engine disabled, when you are upgrading a MySQL instance to a
release where [**mysql\_upgrade**](mysql-upgrade.md "6.4.5 mysql_upgrade — Check and Upgrade MySQL Tables") is still used
(before MySQL 8.0.16), [**mysql\_upgrade**](mysql-upgrade.md "6.4.5 mysql_upgrade — Check and Upgrade MySQL Tables") might
fail with an error. To handle this, you can re-enable that
storage engine while you run [**mysql\_upgrade**](mysql-upgrade.md "6.4.5 mysql_upgrade — Check and Upgrade MySQL Tables"),
then disable it again when you restart the server. For more
information, see [Section 6.4.5, “mysql\_upgrade — Check and Upgrade MySQL Tables”](mysql-upgrade.md "6.4.5 mysql_upgrade — Check and Upgrade MySQL Tables").

##### Replication Framework

The following settings configure replication according to the
MySQL Group Replication requirements.

```ini
server_id=1
gtid_mode=ON
enforce_gtid_consistency=ON
```

These settings configure the server to use the unique
identifier number 1, to enable
[Section 19.1.3, “Replication with Global Transaction Identifiers”](replication-gtids.md "19.1.3 Replication with Global Transaction Identifiers"), and to allow execution of
only statements that can be safely logged using a GTID.

Up to and including MySQL 8.0.20, the following setting is
also required:

```ini
binlog_checksum=NONE
```

This setting disables checksums for events written to the
binary log, which default to being enabled. In MySQL 8.0.21
and later, Group Replication supports the presence of
checksums in the binary log and can use them to verify the
integrity of events on some channels, so you can use the
default setting. For more details, see
[Section 20.3.2, “Group Replication Limitations”](group-replication-limitations.md "20.3.2 Group Replication Limitations").

If you are using a version of MySQL earlier than 8.0.3, where
the defaults were improved for replication, you also need to
add these lines to the member's option file. If you have
any of these system variables in the option file in later
versions, ensure that they are set as shown. For more details
see [Section 20.3.1, “Group Replication Requirements”](group-replication-requirements.md "20.3.1 Group Replication Requirements").

```ini
log_bin=binlog
log_slave_updates=ON
binlog_format=ROW
master_info_repository=TABLE
relay_log_info_repository=TABLE
transaction_write_set_extraction=XXHASH64
```

##### Group Replication Settings

At this point the option file ensures that the server is
configured and is instructed to instantiate the replication
infrastructure under a given configuration. The following
section configures the Group Replication settings for the
server.

```ini
plugin_load_add='group_replication.so'
group_replication_group_name="aaaaaaaa-aaaa-aaaa-aaaa-aaaaaaaaaaaa"
group_replication_start_on_boot=off
group_replication_local_address= "s1:33061"
group_replication_group_seeds= "s1:33061,s2:33061,s3:33061"
group_replication_bootstrap_group=off
```

- `plugin-load-add` adds the Group
  Replication plugin to the list of plugins which the server
  loads at startup. This is preferable in a production
  deployment to installing the plugin manually.
- Configuring
  [`group_replication_group_name`](group-replication-system-variables.md#sysvar_group_replication_group_name)
  tells the plugin that the group that it is joining, or
  creating, is named
  "aaaaaaaa-aaaa-aaaa-aaaa-aaaaaaaaaaaa".

  The value of
  [`group_replication_group_name`](group-replication-system-variables.md#sysvar_group_replication_group_name)
  must be a valid UUID. You can use `SELECT
  UUID()` to generate one. This UUID forms part of
  the GTIDs that are used when transactions received by
  group members from clients, and view change events that
  are generated internally by the group members, are written
  to the binary log.
- Configuring the
  [`group_replication_start_on_boot`](group-replication-system-variables.md#sysvar_group_replication_start_on_boot)
  variable to `off` instructs the plugin to
  not start operations automatically when the server starts.
  This is important when setting up Group Replication as it
  ensures you can configure the server before manually
  starting the plugin. Once the member is configured you can
  set
  [`group_replication_start_on_boot`](group-replication-system-variables.md#sysvar_group_replication_start_on_boot)
  to `on` so that Group Replication starts
  automatically upon server boot.
- Configuring
  [`group_replication_local_address`](group-replication-system-variables.md#sysvar_group_replication_local_address)
  sets the network address and port which the member uses
  for internal communication with other members in the
  group. Group Replication uses this address for internal
  member-to-member connections involving remote instances of
  the group communication engine (XCom, a Paxos variant).

  Important

  The group replication local address must be different to
  the host name and port used for SQL client connections,
  which are defined by MySQL Server's
  [`hostname`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_hostname) and
  [`port`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_port) system variables.
  It must not be used for client applications. It must be
  only be used for internal communication between the
  members of the group while running Group Replication.

  The network address configured by
  [`group_replication_local_address`](group-replication-system-variables.md#sysvar_group_replication_local_address)
  must be resolvable by all group members. For example, if
  each server instance is on a different machine with a
  fixed network address, you could use the IP address of the
  machine, such as 10.0.0.1. If you use a host name, you
  must use a fully qualified name, and ensure it is
  resolvable through DNS, correctly configured
  `/etc/hosts` files, or other name
  resolution processes. In MySQL 8.0.14 and later, IPv6
  addresses (or host names that resolve to them) can be used
  as well as IPv4 addresses. A group can contain a mix of
  members using IPv6 and members using IPv4. For more
  information on Group Replication support for IPv6 networks
  and on mixed IPv4 and IPv6 groups, see
  [Section 20.5.5, “Support For IPv6 And For Mixed IPv6 And IPv4 Groups”](group-replication-ipv6.md "20.5.5 Support For IPv6 And For Mixed IPv6 And IPv4 Groups").

  The recommended port for
  [`group_replication_local_address`](group-replication-system-variables.md#sysvar_group_replication_local_address)
  is 33061. This is used by Group Replication as the unique
  identifier for a group member within the replication
  group. You can use the same port for all members of a
  replication group as long as the host names or IP
  addresses are all different, as demonstrated in this
  tutorial. Alternatively you can use the same host name or
  IP address for all members as long as the ports are all
  different, for example as shown in
  [Section 20.2.2, “Deploying Group Replication Locally”](group-replication-deploying-locally.md "20.2.2 Deploying Group Replication Locally").

  The connection that an existing member offers to a joining
  member for Group Replication's distributed recovery
  process is not the network address configured by
  [`group_replication_local_address`](group-replication-system-variables.md#sysvar_group_replication_local_address).
  In MySQL 8.0.20 and earlier, group members offer their
  standard SQL client connection to joining members for
  distributed recovery, as specified by MySQL Server's
  [`hostname`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_hostname) and
  [`port`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_port) system variables. In
  MySQL 8.0.21 and later, group members may advertise an
  alternative list of distributed recovery endpoints as
  dedicated client connections for joining members. For more
  details, see
  [Section 20.5.4.1, “Connections for Distributed Recovery”](group-replication-distributed-recovery-connections.md "20.5.4.1 Connections for Distributed Recovery").

  Important

  Distributed recovery can fail if a joining member cannot
  correctly identify the other members using the host name
  as defined by MySQL Server's
  [`hostname`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_hostname) system
  variable. It is recommended that operating systems
  running MySQL have a properly configured unique host
  name, either using DNS or local settings. The host name
  that the server is using for SQL client connections can
  be verified in the `Member_host` column
  of the Performance Schema table
  [`replication_group_members`](performance-schema-replication-group-members-table.md "29.12.11.16 The replication_group_members Table").
  If multiple group members externalize a default host
  name set by the operating system, there is a chance of
  the joining member not resolving it to the correct
  member address and not being able to connect for
  distributed recovery. In this situation you can use
  MySQL Server's
  [`report_host`](replication-options-replica.md#sysvar_report_host) system
  variable to configure a unique host name to be
  externalized by each of the servers.
- Configuring
  [`group_replication_group_seeds`](group-replication-system-variables.md#sysvar_group_replication_group_seeds)
  sets the hostname and port of the group members which are
  used by the new member to establish its connection to the
  group. These members are called the seed members. Once the
  connection is established, the group membership
  information is listed in the Performance Schema table
  [`replication_group_members`](performance-schema-replication-group-members-table.md "29.12.11.16 The replication_group_members Table").
  Usually the
  [`group_replication_group_seeds`](group-replication-system-variables.md#sysvar_group_replication_group_seeds)
  list contains the `hostname:port` of each
  of the group member's
  [`group_replication_local_address`](group-replication-system-variables.md#sysvar_group_replication_local_address),
  but this is not obligatory and a subset of the group
  members can be chosen as seeds.

  Important

  The `hostname:port` listed in
  [`group_replication_group_seeds`](group-replication-system-variables.md#sysvar_group_replication_group_seeds)
  is the seed member's internal network address,
  configured by
  [`group_replication_local_address`](group-replication-system-variables.md#sysvar_group_replication_local_address)
  and not the `hostname:port` used for
  SQL client connections, which is shown for example in
  the Performance Schema table
  [`replication_group_members`](performance-schema-replication-group-members-table.md "29.12.11.16 The replication_group_members Table").

  The server that starts the group does not make use of this
  option, since it is the initial server and as such, it is
  in charge of bootstrapping the group. In other words, any
  existing data which is on the server bootstrapping the
  group is what is used as the data for the next joining
  member. The second server joining asks the one and only
  member in the group to join, any missing data on the
  second server is replicated from the donor data on the
  bootstrapping member, and then the group expands. The
  third server joining can ask any of these two to join,
  data is synchronized to the new member, and then the group
  expands again. Subsequent servers repeat this procedure
  when joining.

  Warning

  When joining multiple servers at the same time, make
  sure that they point to seed members that are already in
  the group. Do not use members that are also joining the
  group as seeds, because they might not yet be in the
  group when contacted.

  It is good practice to start the bootstrap member first,
  and let it create the group. Then make it the seed
  member for the rest of the members that are joining.
  This ensures that there is a group formed when joining
  the rest of the members.

  Creating a group and joining multiple members at the
  same time is not supported. It might work, but chances
  are that the operations race and then the act of joining
  the group ends up in an error or a time out.

  A joining member must communicate with a seed member using
  the same protocol (IPv4 or IPv6) that the seed member
  advertises in the
  [`group_replication_group_seeds`](group-replication-system-variables.md#sysvar_group_replication_group_seeds)
  option. For the purpose of IP address permissions for
  Group Replication, the allowlist on the seed member must
  include an IP address for the joining member for the
  protocol offered by the seed member, or a host name that
  resolves to an address for that protocol. This address or
  host name must be set up and permitted in addition to the
  joining member's
  [`group_replication_local_address`](group-replication-system-variables.md#sysvar_group_replication_local_address)
  if the protocol for that address does not match the seed
  member's advertised protocol. If a joining member does not
  have a permitted address for the appropriate protocol, its
  connection attempt is refused. For more information, see
  [Section 20.6.4, “Group Replication IP Address Permissions”](group-replication-ip-address-permissions.md "20.6.4 Group Replication IP Address Permissions").
- Configuring
  [`group_replication_bootstrap_group`](group-replication-system-variables.md#sysvar_group_replication_bootstrap_group)
  instructs the plugin whether to bootstrap the group or
  not. In this case, even though s1 is the first member of
  the group we set this variable to off in the option file.
  Instead we configure
  [`group_replication_bootstrap_group`](group-replication-system-variables.md#sysvar_group_replication_bootstrap_group)
  when the instance is running, to ensure that only one
  member actually bootstraps the group.

  Important

  The
  [`group_replication_bootstrap_group`](group-replication-system-variables.md#sysvar_group_replication_bootstrap_group)
  variable must only be enabled on one server instance
  belonging to a group at any time, usually the first time
  you bootstrap the group (or in case the entire group is
  brought down and back up again). If you bootstrap the
  group multiple times, for example when multiple server
  instances have this option set, then they could create
  an artificial split brain scenario, in which two
  distinct groups with the same name exist. Always set
  [`group_replication_bootstrap_group=off`](group-replication-system-variables.md#sysvar_group_replication_bootstrap_group)
  after the first server instance comes online.

The system variables described in this tutorial are the
required configuration settings to start a new member, but
further system variables are also available to configure group
members. These are listed in
[Section 20.9, “Group Replication Variables”](group-replication-options.md "20.9 Group Replication Variables").

Important

A number of system variables, some specific to Group
Replication and others not, are group-wide configuration
settings that must have the same value on all group members.
If the group members have a value set for one of these
system variables, and a joining member has a different value
set for it, the joining member cannot join the group and an
error message is returned. If the group members have a value
set for this system variable, and the joining member does
not support the system variable, it cannot join the group.
These system variables are all identified in
[Section 20.9, “Group Replication Variables”](group-replication-options.md "20.9 Group Replication Variables").
