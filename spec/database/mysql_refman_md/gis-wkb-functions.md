### 14.16.4 Functions That Create Geometry Values from WKB Values

These functions take as arguments a
[`BLOB`](blob.md "13.3.4 The BLOB and TEXT Types") containing a Well-Known Binary
(WKB) representation and, optionally, a spatial reference system
identifier (SRID). They return the corresponding geometry. For a
description of WKB format, see [Well-Known Binary (WKB) Format](gis-data-formats.md#gis-wkb-format "Well-Known Binary (WKB) Format").

Functions in this section detect arguments in either Cartesian or
geographic spatial reference systems (SRSs), and return results
appropriate to the SRS.

[`ST_GeomFromWKB()`](gis-wkb-functions.md#function_st-geomfromwkb) accepts a WKB
value of any geometry type as its first argument. Other functions
provide type-specific construction functions for construction of
geometry values of each geometry type.

Prior to MySQL 8.0, these functions also accepted
geometry objects as returned by the functions in
[Section 14.16.5, “MySQL-Specific Functions That Create Geometry Values”](gis-mysql-specific-functions.md "14.16.5 MySQL-Specific Functions That Create Geometry Values"). Geometry arguments
are no longer permitted and produce an error. To migrate calls
from using geometry arguments to using WKB arguments, follow these
guidelines:

- Rewrite constructs such as `ST_GeomFromWKB(Point(0,
  0))` as `Point(0, 0)`.
- Rewrite constructs such as `ST_GeomFromWKB(Point(0,
  0), 4326)` as `ST_SRID(Point(0, 0),
  4326)` or `ST_GeomFromWKB(ST_AsWKB(Point(0,
  0)), 4326)`.

Unless otherwise specified, functions in this section handle their
geometry arguments as follows:

- If the WKB or SRID argument is `NULL`, the
  return value is `NULL`.
- By default, geographic coordinates (latitude, longitude) are
  interpreted as in the order specified by the spatial reference
  system of geometry arguments. An optional
  *`options`* argument may be given to
  override the default axis order. `options`
  consists of a list of comma-separated
  `key=value`.
  The only permitted *`key`* value is
  `axis-order`, with permitted values of
  `lat-long`, `long-lat` and
  `srid-defined` (the default).

  If the *`options`* argument is
  `NULL`, the return value is
  `NULL`. If the
  *`options`* argument is invalid, an
  error occurs to indicate why.
- If an SRID argument refers to an undefined spatial reference
  system (SRS), an
  [`ER_SRS_NOT_FOUND`](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/mysql-errors/8.0/en/server-error-reference.html#error_er_srs_not_found) error occurs.
- For geographic SRS geometry arguments, if any argument has a
  longitude or latitude that is out of range, an error occurs:

  - If a longitude value is not in the range (−180,
    180], an
    [`ER_LONGITUDE_OUT_OF_RANGE`](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/mysql-errors/8.0/en/server-error-reference.html#error_er_longitude_out_of_range)
    error occurs.
  - If a latitude value is not in the range [−90, 90],
    an
    [`ER_LATITUDE_OUT_OF_RANGE`](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/mysql-errors/8.0/en/server-error-reference.html#error_er_latitude_out_of_range)
    error occurs.

  Ranges shown are in degrees. If an SRS uses another unit, the
  range uses the corresponding values in its unit. The exact
  range limits deviate slightly due to floating-point
  arithmetic.
