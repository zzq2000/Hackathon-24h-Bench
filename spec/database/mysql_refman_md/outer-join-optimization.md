#### 10.2.1.9 Outer Join Optimization

Outer joins include `LEFT JOIN` and
`RIGHT JOIN`.

MySQL implements an `A LEFT
JOIN B
join_specification` as
follows:

- Table *`B`* is set to depend on
  table *`A`* and all tables on which
  *`A`* depends.
- Table *`A`* is set to depend on all
  tables (except *`B`*) that are used
  in the `LEFT JOIN` condition.
- The `LEFT JOIN` condition is used to
  decide how to retrieve rows from table
  *`B`*. (In other words, any
  condition in the `WHERE` clause is not
  used.)
- All standard join optimizations are performed, with the
  exception that a table is always read after all tables on
  which it depends. If there is a circular dependency, an
  error occurs.
- All standard `WHERE` optimizations are
  performed.
- If there is a row in *`A`* that
  matches the `WHERE` clause, but there is
  no row in *`B`* that matches the
  `ON` condition, an extra
  *`B`* row is generated with all
  columns set to `NULL`.
- If you use `LEFT JOIN` to find rows that
  do not exist in some table and you have the following
  test: `col_name IS
  NULL` in the `WHERE` part, where
  *`col_name`* is a column that is
  declared as `NOT NULL`, MySQL stops
  searching for more rows (for a particular key combination)
  after it has found one row that matches the `LEFT
  JOIN` condition.

The `RIGHT JOIN` implementation is analogous
to that of `LEFT JOIN` with the table roles
reversed. Right joins are converted to equivalent left joins,
as described in [Section 10.2.1.10, “Outer Join Simplification”](outer-join-simplification.md "10.2.1.10 Outer Join Simplification").

For a `LEFT JOIN`, if the
`WHERE` condition is always false for the
generated `NULL` row, the `LEFT
JOIN` is changed to an inner join. For example, the
`WHERE` clause would be false in the
following query if `t2.column1` were
`NULL`:

```sql
SELECT * FROM t1 LEFT JOIN t2 ON (column1) WHERE t2.column2=5;
```

Therefore, it is safe to convert the query to an inner join:

```sql
SELECT * FROM t1, t2 WHERE t2.column2=5 AND t1.column1=t2.column1;
```

In MySQL 8.0.14 and later, trivial `WHERE`
conditions arising from constant literal expressions are
removed during preparation, rather than at a later stage in
optimization, by which time joins have already been
simplified. Earlier removal of trivial conditions allows the
optimizer to convert outer joins to inner joins; this can
result in improved plans for queries with outer joins
containing trivial conditions in the `WHERE`
clause, such as this one:

```sql
SELECT * FROM t1 LEFT JOIN t2 ON condition_1 WHERE condition_2 OR 0 = 1
```

The optimizer now sees during preparation that 0 = 1 is always
false, making `OR 0 = 1` redundant, and
removes it, leaving this:

```sql
SELECT * FROM t1 LEFT JOIN t2 ON condition_1 where condition_2
```

Now the optimizer can rewrite the query as an inner join, like
this:

```sql
SELECT * FROM t1 JOIN t2 WHERE condition_1 AND condition_2
```

Now the optimizer can use table `t2` before
table `t1` if doing so would result in a
better query plan. To provide a hint about the table join
order, use optimizer hints; see
[Section 10.9.3, “Optimizer Hints”](optimizer-hints.md "10.9.3 Optimizer Hints"). Alternatively, use
`STRAIGHT_JOIN`; see
[Section 15.2.13, “SELECT Statement”](select.md "15.2.13 SELECT Statement"). However,
`STRAIGHT_JOIN` may prevent indexes from
being used because it disables semijoin transformations; see
[Section 10.2.2.1, “Optimizing IN and EXISTS Subquery Predicates with Semijoin
Transformations”](semijoins.md "10.2.2.1 Optimizing IN and EXISTS Subquery Predicates with Semijoin Transformations").
