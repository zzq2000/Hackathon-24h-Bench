### 15.1.30 DROP SERVER Statement

```sql
DROP SERVER [ IF EXISTS ] server_name
```

Drops the server definition for the server named
`server_name`. The
corresponding row in the `mysql.servers` table is
deleted. This statement requires the
[`SUPER`](privileges-provided.md#priv_super) privilege.

Dropping a server for a table does not affect any
`FEDERATED` tables that used this connection
information when they were created. See
[Section 15.1.18, “CREATE SERVER Statement”](create-server.md "15.1.18 CREATE SERVER Statement").

`DROP SERVER` causes an implicit commit. See
[Section 15.3.3, “Statements That Cause an Implicit Commit”](implicit-commit.md "15.3.3 Statements That Cause an Implicit Commit").

`DROP SERVER` is not written to the binary log,
regardless of the logging format that is in use.
