## 16.6 Serialized Dictionary Information (SDI)

In addition to storing metadata about database objects in the data
dictionary, MySQL stores it in serialized form. This data is
referred to as serialized dictionary information (SDI).
`InnoDB` stores SDI data within its tablespace
files. [`NDBCLUSTER`](mysql-cluster.md "Chapter 25 MySQL NDB Cluster 8.0") stores SDI data in
the NDB dictionary. Other storage engines store SDI data in
`.sdi` files that are created for a given table
in the table's database directory. SDI data is generated in a
compact `JSON` format.

Serialized dictionary information (SDI) is present in all
`InnoDB` tablespace files except for temporary
tablespace and undo tablespace files. SDI records in an
`InnoDB` tablespace file only describe table and
tablespace objects contained within the tablespace.

SDI data is updated by DDL operations on a table or
[`CHECK TABLE FOR
UPGRADE`](check-table.md "15.7.3.2 CHECK TABLE Statement"). SDI data is not updated when the MySQL server
is upgraded to a new release or version.

The presence of SDI data provides metadata redundancy. For
example, if the data dictionary becomes unavailable, object
metadata can be extracted directly from `InnoDB`
tablespace files using the [**ibd2sdi**](ibd2sdi.md "6.6.1 ibd2sdi — InnoDB Tablespace SDI Extraction Utility") tool.

For `InnoDB`, an SDI record requires a single
index page, which is 16KB in size by default. However, SDI data is
compressed to reduce the storage footprint.

For partitioned `InnoDB` tables comprised of
multiple tablespaces, SDI data is stored in the tablespace file of
the first partition.

The MySQL server uses an internal API that is accessed during
[DDL](glossary.md#glos_ddl "DDL") operations to create and
maintain SDI records.

The [`IMPORT TABLE`](import-table.md "15.2.6 IMPORT TABLE Statement") statement imports
`MyISAM` tables based on information contained in
`.sdi` files. For more information, see
[Section 15.2.6, “IMPORT TABLE Statement”](import-table.md "15.2.6 IMPORT TABLE Statement").
