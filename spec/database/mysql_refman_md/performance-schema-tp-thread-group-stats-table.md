#### 29.12.16.2 The tp\_thread\_group\_stats Table

Note

The Performance Schema table described here is available as
of MySQL 8.0.14. Prior to MySQL 8.0.14, use the
corresponding `INFORMATION_SCHEMA` table
instead; see
[Section 28.5.3, “The INFORMATION\_SCHEMA TP\_THREAD\_GROUP\_STATS Table”](information-schema-tp-thread-group-stats-table.md "28.5.3 The INFORMATION_SCHEMA TP_THREAD_GROUP_STATS Table").

The [`tp_thread_group_stats`](performance-schema-tp-thread-group-stats-table.md "29.12.16.2 The tp_thread_group_stats Table") table
reports statistics per thread group. There is one row per
group.

The [`tp_thread_group_stats`](performance-schema-tp-thread-group-stats-table.md "29.12.16.2 The tp_thread_group_stats Table") table
has these columns:

- `TP_GROUP_ID`

  The thread group ID. This is a unique key within the
  table.
- `CONNECTIONS_STARTED`

  The number of connections started.
- `CONNECTIONS_CLOSED`

  The number of connections closed.
- `QUERIES_EXECUTED`

  The number of statements executed. This number is
  incremented when a statement starts executing, not when it
  finishes.
- `QUERIES_QUEUED`

  The number of statements received that were queued for
  execution. This does not count statements that the thread
  group was able to begin executing immediately without
  queuing, which can happen under the conditions described
  in [Section 7.6.3.3, “Thread Pool Operation”](thread-pool-operation.md "7.6.3.3 Thread Pool Operation").
- `THREADS_STARTED`

  The number of threads started.
- `PRIO_KICKUPS`

  The number of statements that have been moved from
  low-priority queue to high-priority queue based on the
  value of the
  [`thread_pool_prio_kickup_timer`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_thread_pool_prio_kickup_timer)
  system variable. If this number increases quickly,
  consider increasing the value of that variable. A quickly
  increasing counter means that the priority system is not
  keeping transactions from starting too early. For
  [`InnoDB`](innodb-storage-engine.md "Chapter 17 The InnoDB Storage Engine"), this most likely
  means deteriorating performance due to too many concurrent
  transactions..
- `STALLED_QUERIES_EXECUTED`

  The number of statements that have become defined as
  stalled due to executing for longer than the value of the
  [`thread_pool_stall_limit`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_thread_pool_stall_limit)
  system variable.
- `BECOME_CONSUMER_THREAD`

  The number of times thread have been assigned the consumer
  thread role.
- `BECOME_RESERVE_THREAD`

  The number of times threads have been assigned the reserve
  thread role.
- `BECOME_WAITING_THREAD`

  The number of times threads have been assigned the waiter
  thread role. When statements are queued, this happens very
  often, even in normal operation, so rapid increases in
  this value are normal in the case of a highly loaded
  system where statements are queued up.
- `WAKE_THREAD_STALL_CHECKER`

  The number of times the stall check thread decided to wake
  or create a thread to possibly handle some statements or
  take care of the waiter thread role.
- `SLEEP_WAITS`

  The number of `THD_WAIT_SLEEP` waits.
  These occur when threads go to sleep (for example, by
  calling the [`SLEEP()`](miscellaneous-functions.md#function_sleep)
  function).
- `DISK_IO_WAITS`

  The number of `THD_WAIT_DISKIO` waits.
  These occur when threads perform disk I/O that is likely
  to not hit the file system cache. Such waits occur when
  the buffer pool reads and writes data to disk, not for
  normal reads from and writes to files.
- `ROW_LOCK_WAITS`

  The number of `THD_WAIT_ROW_LOCK` waits
  for release of a row lock by another transaction.
- `GLOBAL_LOCK_WAITS`

  The number of `THD_WAIT_GLOBAL_LOCK`
  waits for a global lock to be released.
- `META_DATA_LOCK_WAITS`

  The number of `THD_WAIT_META_DATA_LOCK`
  waits for a metadata lock to be released.
- `TABLE_LOCK_WAITS`

  The number of `THD_WAIT_TABLE_LOCK` waits
  for a table to be unlocked that the statement needs to
  access.
- `USER_LOCK_WAITS`

  The number of `THD_WAIT_USER_LOCK` waits
  for a special lock constructed by the user thread.
- `BINLOG_WAITS`

  The number of `THD_WAIT_BINLOG_WAITS`
  waits for the binary log to become free.
- `GROUP_COMMIT_WAITS`

  The number of `THD_WAIT_GROUP_COMMIT`
  waits. These occur when a group commit must wait for the
  other parties to complete their part of a transaction.
- `FSYNC_WAITS`

  The number of `THD_WAIT_SYNC` waits for a
  file sync operation.

The [`tp_thread_group_stats`](performance-schema-tp-thread-group-stats-table.md "29.12.16.2 The tp_thread_group_stats Table") table
has these indexes:

- Unique index on (`TP_GROUP_ID`)

[`TRUNCATE TABLE`](truncate-table.md "15.1.37 TRUNCATE TABLE Statement") is not permitted
for the [`tp_thread_group_stats`](performance-schema-tp-thread-group-stats-table.md "29.12.16.2 The tp_thread_group_stats Table")
table.
