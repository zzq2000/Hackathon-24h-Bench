### 14.20.4 Named Windows

Windows can be defined and given names by which to refer to them
in `OVER` clauses. To do this, use a
`WINDOW` clause. If present in a query, the
`WINDOW` clause falls between the positions of
the `HAVING` and `ORDER BY`
clauses, and has this syntax:

```sql
WINDOW window_name AS (window_spec)
    [, window_name AS (window_spec)] ...
```

For each window definition,
*`window_name`* is the window name, and
*`window_spec`* is the same type of
window specification as given between the parentheses of an
`OVER` clause, as described in
[Section 14.20.2, “Window Function Concepts and Syntax”](window-functions-usage.md "14.20.2 Window Function Concepts and Syntax"):

```sql
window_spec:
    [window_name] [partition_clause] [order_clause] [frame_clause]
```

A `WINDOW` clause is useful for queries in
which multiple `OVER` clauses would otherwise
define the same window. Instead, you can define the window once,
give it a name, and refer to the name in the
`OVER` clauses. Consider this query, which
defines the same window multiple times:

```sql
SELECT
  val,
  ROW_NUMBER() OVER (ORDER BY val) AS 'row_number',
  RANK()       OVER (ORDER BY val) AS 'rank',
  DENSE_RANK() OVER (ORDER BY val) AS 'dense_rank'
FROM numbers;
```

The query can be written more simply by using
`WINDOW` to define the window once and
referring to the window by name in the `OVER`
clauses:

```sql
SELECT
  val,
  ROW_NUMBER() OVER w AS 'row_number',
  RANK()       OVER w AS 'rank',
  DENSE_RANK() OVER w AS 'dense_rank'
FROM numbers
WINDOW w AS (ORDER BY val);
```

A named window also makes it easier to experiment with the
window definition to see the effect on query results. You need
only modify the window definition in the
`WINDOW` clause, rather than multiple
`OVER` clause definitions.

If an `OVER` clause uses `OVER
(window_name ...)` rather
than `OVER
window_name`, the named
window can be modified by the addition of other clauses. For
example, this query defines a window that includes partitioning,
and uses `ORDER BY` in the
`OVER` clauses to modify the window in
different ways:

```sql
SELECT
  DISTINCT year, country,
  FIRST_VALUE(year) OVER (w ORDER BY year ASC) AS first,
  FIRST_VALUE(year) OVER (w ORDER BY year DESC) AS last
FROM sales
WINDOW w AS (PARTITION BY country);
```

An `OVER` clause can only add properties to a
named window, not modify them. If the named window definition
includes a partitioning, ordering, or framing property, the
`OVER` clause that refers to the window name
cannot also include the same kind of property or an error
occurs:

- This construct is permitted because the window definition
  and the referring `OVER` clause do not
  contain the same kind of properties:

  ```sql
  OVER (w ORDER BY country)
  ... WINDOW w AS (PARTITION BY country)
  ```
- This construct is not permitted because the
  `OVER` clause specifies `PARTITION
  BY` for a named window that already has
  `PARTITION BY`:

  ```sql
  OVER (w PARTITION BY year)
  ... WINDOW w AS (PARTITION BY country)
  ```

The definition of a named window can itself begin with a
*`window_name`*. In such cases, forward
and backward references are permitted, but not cycles:

- This is permitted; it contains forward and backward
  references but no cycles:

  ```sql
  WINDOW w1 AS (w2), w2 AS (), w3 AS (w1)
  ```
- This is not permitted because it contains a cycle:

  ```sql
  WINDOW w1 AS (w2), w2 AS (w3), w3 AS (w1)
  ```
