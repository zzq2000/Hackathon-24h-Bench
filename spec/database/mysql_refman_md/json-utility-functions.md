### 14.17.8 JSON Utility Functions

This section documents utility functions that act on JSON values,
or strings that can be parsed as JSON values.
[`JSON_PRETTY()`](json-utility-functions.md#function_json-pretty) prints out a JSON
value in a format that is easy to read.
[`JSON_STORAGE_SIZE()`](json-utility-functions.md#function_json-storage-size) and
[`JSON_STORAGE_FREE()`](json-utility-functions.md#function_json-storage-free) show,
respectively, the amount of storage space used by a given JSON
value and the amount of space remaining in a
`JSON` column following a partial update.

- [`JSON_PRETTY(json_val)`](json-utility-functions.md#function_json-pretty)

  Provides pretty-printing of JSON values similar to that
  implemented in PHP and by other languages and database
  systems. The value supplied must be a JSON value or a valid
  string representation of a JSON value. Extraneous whitespaces
  and newlines present in this value have no effect on the
  output. For a `NULL` value, the function
  returns `NULL`. If the value is not a JSON
  document, or if it cannot be parsed as one, the function fails
  with an error.

  Formatting of the output from this function adheres to the
  following rules:

  - Each array element or object member appears on a separate
    line, indented by one additional level as compared to its
    parent.
  - Each level of indentation adds two leading spaces.
  - A comma separating individual array elements or object
    members is printed before the newline that separates the
    two elements or members.
  - The key and the value of an object member are separated by
    a colon followed by a space ('`:` ').
  - An empty object or array is printed on a single line. No
    space is printed between the opening and closing brace.
  - Special characters in string scalars and key names are
    escaped employing the same rules used by the
    [`JSON_QUOTE()`](json-creation-functions.md#function_json-quote) function.

      '> "valueY"]},"j", "2"   ]')\G  # nested arrays and objects
  *************************** 1. row ***************************
  JSON_PRETTY('["a",1,{"key1":
               "value1"},"5",     "77" ,
                  {"key2":["value3","valuex",
            "valuey"]},"j", "2"   ]'): [
    "a",
    1,
    {
      "key1": "value1"
    },
    "5",
    "77",
    {
      "key2": [
        "value3",
        "valuex",
        "valuey"
      ]
    },
    "j",
    "2"
  ]
  ```
- [`JSON_STORAGE_FREE(json_val)`](json-utility-functions.md#function_json-storage-free)

  For a [`JSON`](json.md "13.5 The JSON Data Type") column value, this
  function shows how much storage space was freed in its binary
  representation after it was updated in place using
  [`JSON_SET()`](json-modification-functions.md#function_json-set),
  [`JSON_REPLACE()`](json-modification-functions.md#function_json-replace), or
  [`JSON_REMOVE()`](json-modification-functions.md#function_json-remove). The argument can
  also be a valid JSON document or a string which can be parsed
  as one—either as a literal value or as the value of a
  user variable—in which case the function returns 0. It
  returns a positive, nonzero value if the argument is a
  `JSON` column value which has been updated as
  described previously, such that its binary representation
  takes up less space than it did prior to the update. For a
  `JSON` column which has been updated such
  that its binary representation is the same as or larger than
  before, or if the update was not able to take advantage of a
  partial update, it returns 0; it returns
  `NULL` if the argument is
  `NULL`.

  If *`json_val`* is not
  `NULL`, and neither is a valid JSON document
  nor can be successfully parsed as one, an error results.

  In this example, we create a table containing a
  `JSON` column, then insert a row containing a
  JSON object:

  ```sql
  mysql> CREATE TABLE jtable (jcol JSON);
  Query OK, 0 rows affected (0.38 sec)

  mysql> INSERT INTO jtable VALUES
      ->     ('{"a": 10, "b": "wxyz", "c": "[true, false]"}');
  Query OK, 1 row affected (0.04 sec)

  mysql> SELECT * FROM jtable;
  +----------------------------------------------+
  | jcol                                         |
  +----------------------------------------------+
  | {"a": 10, "b": "wxyz", "c": "[true, false]"} |
  +----------------------------------------------+
  1 row in set (0.00 sec)
  ```

  Now we update the column value using
  `JSON_SET()` such that a partial update can
  be performed; in this case, we replace the value pointed to by
  the `c` key (the array `[true,
  false]`) with one that takes up less space (the
  integer `1`):

  ```sql
  mysql> UPDATE jtable
      ->     SET jcol = JSON_SET(jcol, "$.a", 10, "$.b", "wxyz", "$.c", 1);
  Query OK, 1 row affected (0.03 sec)
  Rows matched: 1  Changed: 1  Warnings: 0

  mysql> SELECT * FROM jtable;
  +--------------------------------+
  | jcol                           |
  +--------------------------------+
  | {"a": 10, "b": "wxyz", "c": 1} |
  +--------------------------------+
  1 row in set (0.00 sec)

  mysql> SELECT JSON_STORAGE_FREE(jcol) FROM jtable;
  +-------------------------+
  | JSON_STORAGE_FREE(jcol) |
  +-------------------------+
  |                      14 |
  +-------------------------+
  1 row in set (0.00 sec)
  ```

  The effects of successive partial updates on this free space
  are cumulative, as shown in this example using
  `JSON_SET()` to reduce the space taken up by
  the value having key `b` (and making no other
  changes):

  ```sql
  mysql> UPDATE jtable
      ->     SET jcol = JSON_SET(jcol, "$.a", 10, "$.b", "wx", "$.c", 1);
  Query OK, 1 row affected (0.03 sec)
  Rows matched: 1  Changed: 1  Warnings: 0

  mysql> SELECT JSON_STORAGE_FREE(jcol) FROM jtable;
  +-------------------------+
  | JSON_STORAGE_FREE(jcol) |
  +-------------------------+
  |                      16 |
  +-------------------------+
  1 row in set (0.00 sec)
  ```

  Updating the column without using
  `JSON_SET()`,
  `JSON_REPLACE()`, or
  `JSON_REMOVE()` means that the optimizer
  cannot perform the update in place; in this case,
  `JSON_STORAGE_FREE()` returns 0, as shown
  here:

  ```sql
  mysql> UPDATE jtable SET jcol = '{"a": 10, "b": 1}';
  Query OK, 1 row affected (0.05 sec)
  Rows matched: 1  Changed: 1  Warnings: 0

  mysql> SELECT JSON_STORAGE_FREE(jcol) FROM jtable;
  +-------------------------+
  | JSON_STORAGE_FREE(jcol) |
  +-------------------------+
  |                       0 |
  +-------------------------+
  1 row in set (0.00 sec)
  ```

  Partial updates of JSON documents can be performed only on
  column values. For a user variable that stores a JSON value,
  the value is always completely replaced, even when the update
  is performed using `JSON_SET()`:

  ```sql
  mysql> SET @j = '{"a": 10, "b": "wxyz", "c": "[true, false]"}';
  Query OK, 0 rows affected (0.00 sec)

  mysql> SET @j = JSON_SET(@j, '$.a', 10, '$.b', 'wxyz', '$.c', '1');
  Query OK, 0 rows affected (0.00 sec)

  mysql> SELECT @j, JSON_STORAGE_FREE(@j) AS Free;
  +----------------------------------+------+
  | @j                               | Free |
  +----------------------------------+------+
  | {"a": 10, "b": "wxyz", "c": "1"} |    0 |
  +----------------------------------+------+
  1 row in set (0.00 sec)
  ```

  For a JSON literal, this function always returns 0:

  ```sql
  mysql> SELECT JSON_STORAGE_FREE('{"a": 10, "b": "wxyz", "c": "1"}') AS Free;
  +------+
  | Free |
  +------+
  |    0 |
  +------+
  1 row in set (0.00 sec)
  ```
- [`JSON_STORAGE_SIZE(json_val)`](json-utility-functions.md#function_json-storage-size)

  This function returns the number of bytes used to store the
  binary representation of a JSON document. When the argument is
  a `JSON` column, this is the space used to
  store the JSON document as it was inserted into the column,
  prior to any partial updates that may have been performed on
  it afterwards. *`json_val`* must be a
  valid JSON document or a string which can be parsed as one. In
  the case where it is string, the function returns the amount
  of storage space in the JSON binary representation that is
  created by parsing the string as JSON and converting it to
  binary. It returns `NULL` if the argument is
  `NULL`.

  An error results when *`json_val`* is
  not `NULL`, and is not—or cannot be
  successfully parsed as—a JSON document.

  To illustrate this function's behavior when used with a
  `JSON` column as its argument, we create a
  table named `jtable` containing a
  `JSON` column `jcol`, insert
  a JSON value into the table, then obtain the storage space
  used by this column with
  `JSON_STORAGE_SIZE()`, as shown here:

  ```sql
  mysql> CREATE TABLE jtable (jcol JSON);
  Query OK, 0 rows affected (0.42 sec)

  mysql> INSERT INTO jtable VALUES
      ->     ('{"a": 1000, "b": "wxyz", "c": "[1, 3, 5, 7]"}');
  Query OK, 1 row affected (0.04 sec)

  mysql> SELECT
      ->     jcol,
      ->     JSON_STORAGE_SIZE(jcol) AS Size,
      ->     JSON_STORAGE_FREE(jcol) AS Free
      -> FROM jtable;
  +-----------------------------------------------+------+------+
  | jcol                                          | Size | Free |
  +-----------------------------------------------+------+------+
  | {"a": 1000, "b": "wxyz", "c": "[1, 3, 5, 7]"} |   47 |    0 |
  +-----------------------------------------------+------+------+
  1 row in set (0.00 sec)
  ```

  According to the output of
  `JSON_STORAGE_SIZE()`, the JSON document
  inserted into the column takes up 47 bytes. We also checked
  the amount of space freed by any previous partial updates of
  the column using
  [`JSON_STORAGE_FREE()`](json-utility-functions.md#function_json-storage-free); since no
  updates have yet been performed, this is 0, as expected.

  Next we perform an [`UPDATE`](update.md "15.2.17 UPDATE Statement") on
  the table that should result in a partial update of the
  document stored in `jcol`, and then test the
  result as shown here:

  ```sql
  mysql> UPDATE jtable SET jcol =
      ->     JSON_SET(jcol, "$.b", "a");
  Query OK, 1 row affected (0.04 sec)
  Rows matched: 1  Changed: 1  Warnings: 0

  mysql> SELECT
      ->     jcol,
      ->     JSON_STORAGE_SIZE(jcol) AS Size,
      ->     JSON_STORAGE_FREE(jcol) AS Free
      -> FROM jtable;
  +--------------------------------------------+------+------+
  | jcol                                       | Size | Free |
  +--------------------------------------------+------+------+
  | {"a": 1000, "b": "a", "c": "[1, 3, 5, 7]"} |   47 |    3 |
  +--------------------------------------------+------+------+
  1 row in set (0.00 sec)
  ```

  The value returned by `JSON_STORAGE_FREE()`
  in the previous query indicates that a partial update of the
  JSON document was performed, and that this freed 3 bytes of
  space used to store it. The result returned by
  `JSON_STORAGE_SIZE()` is unchanged by the
  partial update.

  Partial updates are supported for updates using
  [`JSON_SET()`](json-modification-functions.md#function_json-set),
  [`JSON_REPLACE()`](json-modification-functions.md#function_json-replace), or
  [`JSON_REMOVE()`](json-modification-functions.md#function_json-remove). The direct
  assignment of a value to a `JSON` column
  cannot be partially updated; following such an update,
  `JSON_STORAGE_SIZE()` always shows the
  storage used for the newly-set value:

  ```sql
  mysql> UPDATE jtable
  mysql>     SET jcol = '{"a": 4.55, "b": "wxyz", "c": "[true, false]"}';
  Query OK, 1 row affected (0.04 sec)
  Rows matched: 1  Changed: 1  Warnings: 0

  mysql> SELECT
      ->     jcol,
      ->     JSON_STORAGE_SIZE(jcol) AS Size,
      ->     JSON_STORAGE_FREE(jcol) AS Free
      -> FROM jtable;
  +------------------------------------------------+------+------+
  | jcol                                           | Size | Free |
  +------------------------------------------------+------+------+
  | {"a": 4.55, "b": "wxyz", "c": "[true, false]"} |   56 |    0 |
  +------------------------------------------------+------+------+
  1 row in set (0.00 sec)
  ```

  A JSON user variable cannot be partially updated. This means
  that this function always shows the space currently used to
  store a JSON document in a user variable:

  ```sql
  mysql> SET @j = '[100, "sakila", [1, 3, 5], 425.05]';
  Query OK, 0 rows affected (0.00 sec)

  mysql> SELECT @j, JSON_STORAGE_SIZE(@j) AS Size;
  +------------------------------------+------+
  | @j                                 | Size |
  +------------------------------------+------+
  | [100, "sakila", [1, 3, 5], 425.05] |   45 |
  +------------------------------------+------+
  1 row in set (0.00 sec)

  mysql> SET @j = JSON_SET(@j, '$[1]', "json");
  Query OK, 0 rows affected (0.00 sec)

  mysql> SELECT @j, JSON_STORAGE_SIZE(@j) AS Size;
  +----------------------------------+------+
  | @j                               | Size |
  +----------------------------------+------+
  | [100, "json", [1, 3, 5], 425.05] |   43 |
  +----------------------------------+------+
  1 row in set (0.00 sec)

  mysql> SET @j = JSON_SET(@j, '$[2][0]', JSON_ARRAY(10, 20, 30));
  Query OK, 0 rows affected (0.00 sec)

  mysql> SELECT @j, JSON_STORAGE_SIZE(@j) AS Size;
  +---------------------------------------------+------+
  | @j                                          | Size |
  +---------------------------------------------+------+
  | [100, "json", [[10, 20, 30], 3, 5], 425.05] |   56 |
  +---------------------------------------------+------+
  1 row in set (0.00 sec)
  ```

  For a JSON literal, this function always returns the current
  storage space used:

  ```sql
  mysql> SELECT
      ->     JSON_STORAGE_SIZE('[100, "sakila", [1, 3, 5], 425.05]') AS A,
      ->     JSON_STORAGE_SIZE('{"a": 1000, "b": "a", "c": "[1, 3, 5, 7]"}') AS B,
      ->     JSON_STORAGE_SIZE('{"a": 1000, "b": "wxyz", "c": "[1, 3, 5, 7]"}') AS C,
      ->     JSON_STORAGE_SIZE('[100, "json", [[10, 20, 30], 3, 5], 425.05]') AS D;
  +----+----+----+----+
  | A  | B  | C  | D  |
  +----+----+----+----+
  | 45 | 44 | 47 | 56 |
  +----+----+----+----+
  1 row in set (0.00 sec)
  ```
