#### 7.1.13.1 Verifying System Support for IPv6

Before MySQL Server can accept IPv6 connections, the operating
system on your server host must support IPv6. As a simple test
to determine whether that is true, try this command:

```terminal
$> ping6 ::1
16 bytes from ::1, icmp_seq=0 hlim=64 time=0.171 ms
16 bytes from ::1, icmp_seq=1 hlim=64 time=0.077 ms
...
```

To produce a description of your system's network interfaces,
invoke **ifconfig -a** and look for IPv6
addresses in the output.

If your host does not support IPv6, consult your system
documentation for instructions on enabling it. It might be that
you need only reconfigure an existing network interface to add
an IPv6 address. Or a more extensive change might be needed,
such as rebuilding the kernel with IPv6 options enabled.
