## 14.3 Type Conversion in Expression Evaluation

When an operator is used with operands of different types, type
conversion occurs to make the operands compatible. Some
conversions occur implicitly. For example, MySQL automatically
converts strings to numbers as necessary, and vice versa.

```sql
mysql> SELECT 1+'1';
        -> 2
mysql> SELECT CONCAT(2,' test');
        -> '2 test'
```

It is also possible to convert a number to a string explicitly
using the [`CAST()`](cast-functions.md#function_cast) function.
Conversion occurs implicitly with the
[`CONCAT()`](string-functions.md#function_concat) function because it
expects string arguments.

```sql
mysql> SELECT 38.8, CAST(38.8 AS CHAR);
        -> 38.8, '38.8'
mysql> SELECT 38.8, CONCAT(38.8);
        -> 38.8, '38.8'
```

See later in this section for information about the character set
of implicit number-to-string conversions, and for modified rules
that apply to `CREATE TABLE ... SELECT`
statements.

The following rules describe how conversion occurs for comparison
operations:

- If one or both arguments are `NULL`, the
  result of the comparison is `NULL`, except
  for the `NULL`-safe
  [`<=>`](comparison-operators.md#operator_equal-to)
  equality comparison operator. For `NULL <=>
  NULL`, the result is true. No conversion is needed.
- If both arguments in a comparison operation are strings, they
  are compared as strings.
- If both arguments are integers, they are compared as integers.
- Hexadecimal values are treated as binary strings if not
  compared to a number.
- If one of the arguments is a
  [`TIMESTAMP`](datetime.md "13.2.2 The DATE, DATETIME, and TIMESTAMP Types") or
  [`DATETIME`](datetime.md "13.2.2 The DATE, DATETIME, and TIMESTAMP Types") column and the other
  argument is a constant, the constant is converted to a
  timestamp before the comparison is performed. This is done to
  be more ODBC-friendly. This is not done for the arguments to
  [`IN()`](comparison-operators.md#operator_in). To be safe, always use
  complete datetime, date, or time strings when doing
  comparisons. For example, to achieve best results when using
  [`BETWEEN`](comparison-operators.md#operator_between) with date or time values,
  use [`CAST()`](cast-functions.md#function_cast) to explicitly
  convert the values to the desired data type.

  A single-row subquery from a table or tables is not considered
  a constant. For example, if a subquery returns an integer to
  be compared to a [`DATETIME`](datetime.md "13.2.2 The DATE, DATETIME, and TIMESTAMP Types")
  value, the comparison is done as two integers. The integer is
  not converted to a temporal value. To compare the operands as
  [`DATETIME`](datetime.md "13.2.2 The DATE, DATETIME, and TIMESTAMP Types") values, use
  [`CAST()`](cast-functions.md#function_cast) to explicitly convert
  the subquery value to [`DATETIME`](datetime.md "13.2.2 The DATE, DATETIME, and TIMESTAMP Types").
- If one of the arguments is a decimal value, comparison depends
  on the other argument. The arguments are compared as decimal
  values if the other argument is a decimal or integer value, or
  as floating-point values if the other argument is a
  floating-point value.
- In all other cases, the arguments are compared as
  floating-point (double-precision) numbers. For example, a
  comparison of string and numeric operands takes place as a
  comparison of floating-point numbers.

For information about conversion of values from one temporal type
to another, see [Section 13.2.8, “Conversion Between Date and Time Types”](date-and-time-type-conversion.md "13.2.8 Conversion Between Date and Time Types").

Comparison of JSON values takes place at two levels. The first
level of comparison is based on the JSON types of the compared
values. If the types differ, the comparison result is determined
solely by which type has higher precedence. If the two values have
the same JSON type, a second level of comparison occurs using
type-specific rules. For comparison of JSON and non-JSON values,
the non-JSON value is converted to JSON and the values compared as
JSON values. For details, see [Comparison and Ordering of JSON Values](json.md#json-comparison "Comparison and Ordering of JSON Values").

The following examples illustrate conversion of strings to numbers
for comparison operations:

```sql
mysql> SELECT 1 > '6x';
        -> 0
mysql> SELECT 7 > '6x';
        -> 1
mysql> SELECT 0 > 'x6';
        -> 0
mysql> SELECT 0 = 'x6';
        -> 1
```

For comparisons of a string column with a number, MySQL cannot use
an index on the column to look up the value quickly. If
*`str_col`* is an indexed string column,
the index cannot be used when performing the lookup in the
following statement:

```sql
SELECT * FROM tbl_name WHERE str_col=1;
```

The reason for this is that there are many different strings that
may convert to the value `1`, such as
`'1'`, `' 1'`, or
`'1a'`.

Another issue can arise when comparing a string column with
integer `0`. Consider table `t1`
created and populated as shown here:

```sql
mysql> CREATE TABLE t1 (
    ->   c1 INT NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT,
    ->   c2 INT DEFAULT NULL,
    ->   c3 VARCHAR(25) DEFAULT NULL,
    ->   PRIMARY KEY (c1)
    -> );
Query OK, 0 rows affected (0.03 sec)

mysql> INSERT INTO t1 VALUES ROW(1, 52, 'grape'), ROW(2, 139, 'apple'),
    ->                       ROW(3, 37, 'peach'), ROW(4, 221, 'watermelon'),
    ->                       ROW(5, 83, 'pear');
Query OK, 5 rows affected (0.01 sec)
Records: 5  Duplicates: 0  Warnings: 0
```

Observe the result when selecting from this table and comparing
`c3`, which is a
[`VARCHAR`](char.md "13.3.2 The CHAR and VARCHAR Types") column, with integer
`0`:

```sql
mysql> SELECT * FROM t1 WHERE c3 = 0;
+----+------+------------+
| c1 | c2   | c3         |
+----+------+------------+
|  1 |   52 | grape      |
|  2 |  139 | apple      |
|  3 |   37 | peach      |
|  4 |  221 | watermelon |
|  5 |   83 | pear       |
+----+------+------------+
5 rows in set, 5 warnings (0.00 sec)
```

*This occurs even when using strict SQL mode*.
To prevent this from happening, quote the value, as shown here:

```sql
mysql> SELECT * FROM t1 WHERE c3 = '0';
Empty set (0.00 sec)
```

This does *not* occur when
[`SELECT`](select.md "15.2.13 SELECT Statement") is part of a data definition
statement such as
[`CREATE TABLE
... SELECT`](create-table-select.md "15.1.20.4 CREATE TABLE ... SELECT Statement"); in strict mode, the statement fails due to
the invalid comparison:

```sql
mysql> CREATE TABLE t2 SELECT * FROM t1 WHERE c3 = 0;
ERROR 1292 (22007): Truncated incorrect DOUBLE value: 'grape'
```

When the `0` is quoted, the statement succeeds,
but the table created contains no rows because there were none
matching `'0'`, as shown here:

```sql
mysql> CREATE TABLE t2 SELECT * FROM t1 WHERE c3 = '0';
Query OK, 0 rows affected (0.03 sec)
Records: 0  Duplicates: 0  Warnings: 0

mysql> SELECT * FROM t2;
Empty set (0.00 sec)
```

This is a known issue, which is due to the fact that strict mode
is not applied when processing `SELECT`. See also
[Strict SQL Mode](sql-mode.md#sql-mode-strict "Strict SQL Mode").

Comparisons between floating-point numbers and large integer
values are approximate because the integer is converted to
double-precision floating point before comparison, which is not
capable of representing all 64-bit integers exactly. For example,
the integer value 253 + 1 is not
representable as a float, and is rounded to
253 or 253 +
2 before a float comparison, depending on the platform.

To illustrate, only the first of the following comparisons
compares equal values, but both comparisons return true (1):

```sql
mysql> SELECT '9223372036854775807' = 9223372036854775807;
        -> 1
mysql> SELECT '9223372036854775807' = 9223372036854775806;
        -> 1
```

When conversions from string to floating-point and from integer to
floating-point occur, they do not necessarily occur the same way.
The integer may be converted to floating-point by the CPU, whereas
the string is converted digit by digit in an operation that
involves floating-point multiplications. Also, results can be
affected by factors such as computer architecture or the compiler
version or optimization level. One way to avoid such problems is
to use [`CAST()`](cast-functions.md#function_cast) so that a value is
not converted implicitly to a float-point number:

```sql
mysql> SELECT CAST('9223372036854775807' AS UNSIGNED) = 9223372036854775806;
        -> 0
```

For more information about floating-point comparisons, see
[Section B.3.4.8, “Problems with Floating-Point Values”](problems-with-float.md "B.3.4.8 Problems with Floating-Point Values").

The server includes `dtoa`, a conversion library
that provides the basis for improved conversion between string or
[`DECIMAL`](fixed-point-types.md "13.1.3 Fixed-Point Types (Exact Value) - DECIMAL, NUMERIC") values and
approximate-value
([`FLOAT`](floating-point-types.md "13.1.4 Floating-Point Types (Approximate Value) - FLOAT, DOUBLE")/[`DOUBLE`](floating-point-types.md "13.1.4 Floating-Point Types (Approximate Value) - FLOAT, DOUBLE"))
numbers:

- Consistent conversion results across platforms, which
  eliminates, for example, Unix versus Windows conversion
  differences.
- Accurate representation of values in cases where results
  previously did not provide sufficient precision, such as for
  values close to IEEE limits.
- Conversion of numbers to string format with the best possible
  precision. The precision of `dtoa` is always
  the same or better than that of the standard C library
  functions.

Because the conversions produced by this library differ in some
cases from non-`dtoa` results, the potential
exists for incompatibilities in applications that rely on previous
results. For example, applications that depend on a specific exact
result from previous conversions might need adjustment to
accommodate additional precision.

The `dtoa` library provides conversions with the
following properties. *`D`* represents a
value with a [`DECIMAL`](fixed-point-types.md "13.1.3 Fixed-Point Types (Exact Value) - DECIMAL, NUMERIC") or string
representation, and *`F`* represents a
floating-point number in native binary (IEEE) format.

- *`F`* ->
  *`D`* conversion is done with the best
  possible precision, returning *`D`* as
  the shortest string that yields *`F`*
  when read back in and rounded to the nearest value in native
  binary format as specified by IEEE.
- *`D`* ->
  *`F`* conversion is done such that
  *`F`* is the nearest native binary
  number to the input decimal string
  *`D`*.

These properties imply that *`F`* ->
*`D`* -> *`F`*
conversions are lossless unless *`F`* is
`-inf`, `+inf`, or
`NaN`. The latter values are not supported
because the SQL standard defines them as invalid values for
[`FLOAT`](floating-point-types.md "13.1.4 Floating-Point Types (Approximate Value) - FLOAT, DOUBLE") or
[`DOUBLE`](floating-point-types.md "13.1.4 Floating-Point Types (Approximate Value) - FLOAT, DOUBLE").

For *`D`* ->
*`F`* -> *`D`*
conversions, a sufficient condition for losslessness is that
*`D`* uses 15 or fewer digits of precision,
is not a denormal value, `-inf`,
`+inf`, or `NaN`. In some cases,
the conversion is lossless even if *`D`*
has more than 15 digits of precision, but this is not always the
case.

Implicit conversion of a numeric or temporal value to string
produces a value that has a character set and collation determined
by the [`character_set_connection`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_character_set_connection)
and [`collation_connection`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_collation_connection) system
variables. (These variables commonly are set with
[`SET NAMES`](set-names.md "15.7.6.3 SET NAMES Statement"). For information about
connection character sets, see
[Section 12.4, “Connection Character Sets and Collations”](charset-connection.md "12.4 Connection Character Sets and Collations").)

This means that such a conversion results in a character
(nonbinary) string (a [`CHAR`](char.md "13.3.2 The CHAR and VARCHAR Types"),
[`VARCHAR`](char.md "13.3.2 The CHAR and VARCHAR Types"), or
[`LONGTEXT`](blob.md "13.3.4 The BLOB and TEXT Types") value), except in the case
that the connection character set is set to
`binary`. In that case, the conversion result is
a binary string (a [`BINARY`](binary-varbinary.md "13.3.3 The BINARY and VARBINARY Types"),
[`VARBINARY`](binary-varbinary.md "13.3.3 The BINARY and VARBINARY Types"), or
[`LONGBLOB`](blob.md "13.3.4 The BLOB and TEXT Types") value).

For integer expressions, the preceding remarks about expression
*evaluation* apply somewhat differently for
expression *assignment*; for example, in a
statement such as this:

```sql
CREATE TABLE t SELECT integer_expr;
```

In this case, the table in the column resulting from the
expression has type [`INT`](integer-types.md "13.1.2 Integer Types (Exact Value) - INTEGER, INT, SMALLINT, TINYINT, MEDIUMINT, BIGINT") or
[`BIGINT`](integer-types.md "13.1.2 Integer Types (Exact Value) - INTEGER, INT, SMALLINT, TINYINT, MEDIUMINT, BIGINT") depending on the length of
the integer expression. If the maximum length of the expression
does not fit in an [`INT`](integer-types.md "13.1.2 Integer Types (Exact Value) - INTEGER, INT, SMALLINT, TINYINT, MEDIUMINT, BIGINT"),
[`BIGINT`](integer-types.md "13.1.2 Integer Types (Exact Value) - INTEGER, INT, SMALLINT, TINYINT, MEDIUMINT, BIGINT") is used instead. The length
is taken from the `max_length` value of the
[`SELECT`](select.md "15.2.13 SELECT Statement") result set metadata (see
[C API Basic Data Structures](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/c-api/8.0/en/c-api-data-structures.html)). This means that you can
force a [`BIGINT`](integer-types.md "13.1.2 Integer Types (Exact Value) - INTEGER, INT, SMALLINT, TINYINT, MEDIUMINT, BIGINT") rather than
[`INT`](integer-types.md "13.1.2 Integer Types (Exact Value) - INTEGER, INT, SMALLINT, TINYINT, MEDIUMINT, BIGINT") by use of a sufficiently long
expression:

```sql
CREATE TABLE t SELECT 000000000000000000000;
```
