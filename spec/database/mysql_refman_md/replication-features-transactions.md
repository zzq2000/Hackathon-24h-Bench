#### 19.5.1.35 Replication and Transactions

**Mixing transactional and nontransactional statements within the same
transaction.**
In general, you should avoid transactions that update both
transactional and nontransactional tables in a replication
environment. You should also avoid using any statement that
accesses both transactional (or temporary) and
nontransactional tables and writes to any of them.

The server uses these rules for binary logging:

- If the initial statements in a transaction are
  nontransactional, they are written to the binary log
  immediately. The remaining statements in the transaction are
  cached and not written to the binary log until the
  transaction is committed. (If the transaction is rolled
  back, the cached statements are written to the binary log
  only if they make nontransactional changes that cannot be
  rolled back. Otherwise, they are discarded.)
- For statement-based logging, logging of nontransactional
  statements is affected by the
  [`binlog_direct_non_transactional_updates`](replication-options-binary-log.md#sysvar_binlog_direct_non_transactional_updates)
  system variable. When this variable is
  `OFF` (the default), logging is as just
  described. When this variable is `ON`,
  logging occurs immediately for nontransactional statements
  occurring anywhere in the transaction (not just initial
  nontransactional statements). Other statements are kept in
  the transaction cache and logged when the transaction
  commits.
  [`binlog_direct_non_transactional_updates`](replication-options-binary-log.md#sysvar_binlog_direct_non_transactional_updates)
  has no effect for row-format or mixed-format binary logging.

**Transactional, nontransactional, and mixed statements.**
To apply those rules, the server considers a statement
nontransactional if it changes only nontransactional tables,
and transactional if it changes only transactional tables. A
statement that references both nontransactional and
transactional tables and updates *any* of
the tables involved is considered a “mixed”
statement. Mixed statements, like transactional statements,
are cached and logged when the transaction commits.

A mixed statement that updates a transactional table is
considered unsafe if the statement also performs either of the
following actions:

- Updates or reads a temporary table
- Reads a nontransactional table and the transaction isolation
  level is less than REPEATABLE\_READ

A mixed statement following the update of a transactional table
within a transaction is considered unsafe if it performs either
of the following actions:

- Updates any table and reads from any temporary table
- Updates a nontransactional table and
  [`binlog_direct_non_transactional_updates`](replication-options-binary-log.md#sysvar_binlog_direct_non_transactional_updates)
  is OFF

For more information, see
[Section 19.2.1.3, “Determination of Safe and Unsafe Statements in Binary Logging”](replication-rbr-safe-unsafe.md "19.2.1.3 Determination of Safe and Unsafe Statements in Binary Logging").

Note

A mixed statement is unrelated to mixed binary logging format.

In situations where transactions mix updates to transactional
and nontransactional tables, the order of statements in the
binary log is correct, and all needed statements are written to
the binary log even in case of a
[`ROLLBACK`](commit.md "15.3.1 START TRANSACTION, COMMIT, and ROLLBACK Statements").
However, when a second connection updates the nontransactional
table before the first connection transaction is complete,
statements can be logged out of order because the second
connection update is written immediately after it is performed,
regardless of the state of the transaction being performed by
the first connection.

**Using different storage engines on source and replica.**
It is possible to replicate transactional tables on the source
using nontransactional tables on the replica. For example, you
can replicate an `InnoDB` source table as a
`MyISAM` replica table. However, if you do
this, there are problems if the replica is stopped in the
middle of a
[`BEGIN`](commit.md "15.3.1 START TRANSACTION, COMMIT, and ROLLBACK Statements") ...
[`COMMIT`](commit.md "15.3.1 START TRANSACTION, COMMIT, and ROLLBACK Statements") block because the
replica restarts at the beginning of the
[`BEGIN`](commit.md "15.3.1 START TRANSACTION, COMMIT, and ROLLBACK Statements") block.

It is also safe to replicate transactions from
[`MyISAM`](myisam-storage-engine.md "18.2 The MyISAM Storage Engine") tables on the source to
transactional tables, such as tables that use the
[`InnoDB`](innodb-storage-engine.md "Chapter 17 The InnoDB Storage Engine") storage engine, on the
replica. In such cases, an
[`AUTOCOMMIT=1`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_autocommit)
statement issued on the source is replicated, thus enforcing
`AUTOCOMMIT` mode on the replica.

When the storage engine type of the replica is nontransactional,
transactions on the source that mix updates of transactional and
nontransactional tables should be avoided because they can cause
inconsistency of the data between the source transactional table
and the replica nontransactional table. That is, such
transactions can lead to source storage engine-specific behavior
with the possible effect of replication going out of synchrony.
MySQL does not issue a warning about this, so extra care should
be taken when replicating transactional tables from the source
to nontransactional tables on the replicas.

**Changing the binary logging format within transactions.**
The [`binlog_format`](replication-options-binary-log.md#sysvar_binlog_format) and
[`binlog_checksum`](replication-options-binary-log.md#sysvar_binlog_checksum) system
variables are read-only as long as a transaction is in
progress.

Every transaction (including
[`autocommit`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_autocommit) transactions) is
recorded in the binary log as though it starts with a
[`BEGIN`](commit.md "15.3.1 START TRANSACTION, COMMIT, and ROLLBACK Statements")
statement, and ends with either a
[`COMMIT`](commit.md "15.3.1 START TRANSACTION, COMMIT, and ROLLBACK Statements") or a
[`ROLLBACK`](commit.md "15.3.1 START TRANSACTION, COMMIT, and ROLLBACK Statements")
statement. This is even true for statements affecting tables
that use a nontransactional storage engine (such as
[`MyISAM`](myisam-storage-engine.md "18.2 The MyISAM Storage Engine")).
