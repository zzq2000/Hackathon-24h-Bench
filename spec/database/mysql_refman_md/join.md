#### 15.2.13.2 JOIN Clause

MySQL supports the following `JOIN` syntax for
the *`table_references`* part of
[`SELECT`](select.md "15.2.13 SELECT Statement") statements and
multiple-table [`DELETE`](delete.md "15.2.2 DELETE Statement") and
[`UPDATE`](update.md "15.2.17 UPDATE Statement") statements:

```sql
table_references:
    escaped_table_reference [, escaped_table_reference] ...

escaped_table_reference: {
    table_reference
  | { OJ table_reference }
}

table_reference: {
    table_factor
  | joined_table
}

table_factor: {
    tbl_name [PARTITION (partition_names)]
        [[AS] alias] [index_hint_list]
  | [LATERAL] table_subquery [AS] alias [(col_list)]
  | ( table_references )
}

joined_table: {
    table_reference {[INNER | CROSS] JOIN | STRAIGHT_JOIN} table_factor [join_specification]
  | table_reference {LEFT|RIGHT} [OUTER] JOIN table_reference join_specification
  | table_reference NATURAL [INNER | {LEFT|RIGHT} [OUTER]] JOIN table_factor
}

join_specification: {
    ON search_condition
  | USING (join_column_list)
}

join_column_list:
    column_name[, column_name] ...

index_hint_list:
    index_hint[ index_hint] ...

index_hint: {
    USE {INDEX|KEY}
      [FOR {JOIN|ORDER BY|GROUP BY}] ([index_list])
  | {IGNORE|FORCE} {INDEX|KEY}
      [FOR {JOIN|ORDER BY|GROUP BY}] (index_list)
}

index_list:
    index_name [, index_name] ...
```

A table reference is also known as a join expression.

A table reference (when it refers to a partitioned table) may
contain a `PARTITION` clause, including a list
of comma-separated partitions, subpartitions, or both. This
option follows the name of the table and precedes any alias
declaration. The effect of this option is that rows are selected
only from the listed partitions or subpartitions. Any partitions
or subpartitions not named in the list are ignored. For more
information and examples, see
[Section 26.5, “Partition Selection”](partitioning-selection.md "26.5 Partition Selection").

The syntax of *`table_factor`* is
extended in MySQL in comparison with standard SQL. The standard
accepts only *`table_reference`*, not a
list of them inside a pair of parentheses.

This is a conservative extension if each comma in a list of
*`table_reference`* items is considered
as equivalent to an inner join. For example:

```sql
SELECT * FROM t1 LEFT JOIN (t2, t3, t4)
                 ON (t2.a = t1.a AND t3.b = t1.b AND t4.c = t1.c)
```

is equivalent to:

```sql
SELECT * FROM t1 LEFT JOIN (t2 CROSS JOIN t3 CROSS JOIN t4)
                 ON (t2.a = t1.a AND t3.b = t1.b AND t4.c = t1.c)
```

In MySQL, `JOIN`, `CROSS
JOIN`, and `INNER JOIN` are syntactic
equivalents (they can replace each other). In standard SQL, they
are not equivalent. `INNER JOIN` is used with
an `ON` clause, `CROSS JOIN`
is used otherwise.

In general, parentheses can be ignored in join expressions
containing only inner join operations. MySQL also supports
nested joins. See [Section 10.2.1.8, “Nested Join Optimization”](nested-join-optimization.md "10.2.1.8 Nested Join Optimization").

Index hints can be specified to affect how the MySQL optimizer
makes use of indexes. For more information, see
[Section 10.9.4, “Index Hints”](index-hints.md "10.9.4 Index Hints"). Optimizer hints and the
`optimizer_switch` system variable are other
ways to influence optimizer use of indexes. See
[Section 10.9.3, “Optimizer Hints”](optimizer-hints.md "10.9.3 Optimizer Hints"), and
[Section 10.9.2, “Switchable Optimizations”](switchable-optimizations.md "10.9.2 Switchable Optimizations").

The following list describes general factors to take into
account when writing joins:

- A table reference can be aliased using
  `tbl_name AS
  alias_name` or
  *`tbl_name alias_name`*:

  ```sql
  SELECT t1.name, t2.salary
    FROM employee AS t1 INNER JOIN info AS t2 ON t1.name = t2.name;

  SELECT t1.name, t2.salary
    FROM employee t1 INNER JOIN info t2 ON t1.name = t2.name;
  ```
- A *`table_subquery`* is also known as
  a derived table or subquery in the `FROM`
  clause. See [Section 15.2.15.8, “Derived Tables”](derived-tables.md "15.2.15.8 Derived Tables"). Such
  subqueries *must* include an alias to
  give the subquery result a table name, and may optionally
  include a list of table column names in parentheses. A
  trivial example follows:

  ```sql
  SELECT * FROM (SELECT 1, 2, 3) AS t1;
  ```
- The maximum number of tables that can be referenced in a
  single join is 61. This includes a join handled by merging
  derived tables and views in the `FROM`
  clause into the outer query block (see
  [Section 10.2.2.4, “Optimizing Derived Tables, View References, and Common Table Expressions
  with Merging or Materialization”](derived-table-optimization.md "10.2.2.4 Optimizing Derived Tables, View References, and Common Table Expressions with Merging or Materialization")).
- `INNER JOIN` and `,`
  (comma) are semantically equivalent in the absence of a join
  condition: both produce a Cartesian product between the
  specified tables (that is, each and every row in the first
  table is joined to each and every row in the second table).

  However, the precedence of the comma operator is less than
  that of `INNER JOIN`, `CROSS
  JOIN`, `LEFT JOIN`, and so on. If
  you mix comma joins with the other join types when there is
  a join condition, an error of the form `Unknown
  column 'col_name' in 'on
  clause'` may occur. Information about dealing with
  this problem is given later in this section.
- The *`search_condition`* used with
  `ON` is any conditional expression of the
  form that can be used in a `WHERE` clause.
  Generally, the `ON` clause serves for
  conditions that specify how to join tables, and the
  `WHERE` clause restricts which rows to
  include in the result set.
- If there is no matching row for the right table in the
  `ON` or `USING` part in a
  `LEFT JOIN`, a row with all columns set to
  `NULL` is used for the right table. You can
  use this fact to find rows in a table that have no
  counterpart in another table:

  ```sql
  SELECT left_tbl.*
    FROM left_tbl LEFT JOIN right_tbl ON left_tbl.id = right_tbl.id
    WHERE right_tbl.id IS NULL;
  ```

  This example finds all rows in `left_tbl`
  with an `id` value that is not present in
  `right_tbl` (that is, all rows in
  `left_tbl` with no corresponding row in
  `right_tbl`). See
  [Section 10.2.1.9, “Outer Join Optimization”](outer-join-optimization.md "10.2.1.9 Outer Join Optimization").
- The
  `USING(join_column_list)`
  clause names a list of columns that must exist in both
  tables. If tables `a` and
  `b` both contain columns
  `c1`, `c2`, and
  `c3`, the following join compares
  corresponding columns from the two tables:

  ```sql
  a LEFT JOIN b USING (c1, c2, c3)
  ```
- The `NATURAL [LEFT] JOIN` of two tables is
  defined to be semantically equivalent to an `INNER
  JOIN` or a `LEFT JOIN` with a
  `USING` clause that names all columns that
  exist in both tables.
- `RIGHT JOIN` works analogously to
  `LEFT JOIN`. To keep code portable across
  databases, it is recommended that you use `LEFT
  JOIN` instead of `RIGHT JOIN`.
- The `{ OJ ... }` syntax shown in the join
  syntax description exists only for compatibility with ODBC.
  The curly braces in the syntax should be written literally;
  they are not metasyntax as used elsewhere in syntax
  descriptions.

  ```sql
  SELECT left_tbl.*
      FROM { OJ left_tbl LEFT OUTER JOIN right_tbl
             ON left_tbl.id = right_tbl.id }
      WHERE right_tbl.id IS NULL;
  ```

  You can use other types of joins within `{ OJ ...
  }`, such as `INNER JOIN` or
  `RIGHT OUTER JOIN`. This helps with
  compatibility with some third-party applications, but is not
  official ODBC syntax.
- `STRAIGHT_JOIN` is similar to
  `JOIN`, except that the left table is
  always read before the right table. This can be used for
  those (few) cases for which the join optimizer processes the
  tables in a suboptimal order.

Some join examples:

```sql
SELECT * FROM table1, table2;

SELECT * FROM table1 INNER JOIN table2 ON table1.id = table2.id;

SELECT * FROM table1 LEFT JOIN table2 ON table1.id = table2.id;

SELECT * FROM table1 LEFT JOIN table2 USING (id);

SELECT * FROM table1 LEFT JOIN table2 ON table1.id = table2.id
  LEFT JOIN table3 ON table2.id = table3.id;
```

Natural joins and joins with `USING`, including
outer join variants, are processed according to the SQL:2003
standard:

- Redundant columns of a `NATURAL` join do
  not appear. Consider this set of statements:

  ```sql
  CREATE TABLE t1 (i INT, j INT);
  CREATE TABLE t2 (k INT, j INT);
  INSERT INTO t1 VALUES(1, 1);
  INSERT INTO t2 VALUES(1, 1);
  SELECT * FROM t1 NATURAL JOIN t2;
  SELECT * FROM t1 JOIN t2 USING (j);
  ```

  In the first [`SELECT`](select.md "15.2.13 SELECT Statement")
  statement, column `j` appears in both
  tables and thus becomes a join column, so, according to
  standard SQL, it should appear only once in the output, not
  twice. Similarly, in the second SELECT statement, column
  `j` is named in the
  `USING` clause and should appear only once
  in the output, not twice.

  Thus, the statements produce this output:

  ```none
  +------+------+------+
  | j    | i    | k    |
  +------+------+------+
  |    1 |    1 |    1 |
  +------+------+------+
  +------+------+------+
  | j    | i    | k    |
  +------+------+------+
  |    1 |    1 |    1 |
  +------+------+------+
  ```

  Redundant column elimination and column ordering occurs
  according to standard SQL, producing this display order:

  - First, coalesced common columns of the two joined
    tables, in the order in which they occur in the first
    table
  - Second, columns unique to the first table, in order in
    which they occur in that table
  - Third, columns unique to the second table, in order in
    which they occur in that table

  The single result column that replaces two common columns is
  defined using the coalesce operation. That is, for two
  `t1.a` and `t2.a` the
  resulting single join column `a` is defined
  as `a = COALESCE(t1.a, t2.a)`, where:

  ```sql
  COALESCE(x, y) = (CASE WHEN x IS NOT NULL THEN x ELSE y END)
  ```

  If the join operation is any other join, the result columns
  of the join consist of the concatenation of all columns of
  the joined tables.

  A consequence of the definition of coalesced columns is
  that, for outer joins, the coalesced column contains the
  value of the non-`NULL` column if one of
  the two columns is always `NULL`. If
  neither or both columns are `NULL`, both
  common columns have the same value, so it doesn't matter
  which one is chosen as the value of the coalesced column. A
  simple way to interpret this is to consider that a coalesced
  column of an outer join is represented by the common column
  of the inner table of a `JOIN`. Suppose
  that the tables `t1(a, b)` and
  `t2(a, c)` have the following contents:

  ```none
  t1    t2
  ----  ----
  1 x   2 z
  2 y   3 w
  ```

  Then, for this join, column `a` contains
  the values of `t1.a`:

  ```sql
  mysql> SELECT * FROM t1 NATURAL LEFT JOIN t2;
  +------+------+------+
  | a    | b    | c    |
  +------+------+------+
  |    1 | x    | NULL |
  |    2 | y    | z    |
  +------+------+------+
  ```

  By contrast, for this join, column `a`
  contains the values of `t2.a`.

  ```sql
  mysql> SELECT * FROM t1 NATURAL RIGHT JOIN t2;
  +------+------+------+
  | a    | c    | b    |
  +------+------+------+
  |    2 | z    | y    |
  |    3 | w    | NULL |
  +------+------+------+
  ```

  Compare those results to the otherwise equivalent queries
  with `JOIN ... ON`:

  ```sql
  mysql> SELECT * FROM t1 LEFT JOIN t2 ON (t1.a = t2.a);
  +------+------+------+------+
  | a    | b    | a    | c    |
  +------+------+------+------+
  |    1 | x    | NULL | NULL |
  |    2 | y    |    2 | z    |
  +------+------+------+------+
  ```

  ```sql
  mysql> SELECT * FROM t1 RIGHT JOIN t2 ON (t1.a = t2.a);
  +------+------+------+------+
  | a    | b    | a    | c    |
  +------+------+------+------+
  |    2 | y    |    2 | z    |
  | NULL | NULL |    3 | w    |
  +------+------+------+------+
  ```
- A `USING` clause can be rewritten as an
  `ON` clause that compares corresponding
  columns. However, although `USING` and
  `ON` are similar, they are not quite the
  same. Consider the following two queries:

  ```sql
  a LEFT JOIN b USING (c1, c2, c3)
  a LEFT JOIN b ON a.c1 = b.c1 AND a.c2 = b.c2 AND a.c3 = b.c3
  ```

  With respect to determining which rows satisfy the join
  condition, both joins are semantically identical.

  With respect to determining which columns to display for
  `SELECT *` expansion, the two joins are not
  semantically identical. The `USING` join
  selects the coalesced value of corresponding columns,
  whereas the `ON` join selects all columns
  from all tables. For the `USING` join,
  `SELECT *` selects these values:

  ```sql
  COALESCE(a.c1, b.c1), COALESCE(a.c2, b.c2), COALESCE(a.c3, b.c3)
  ```

  For the `ON` join, `SELECT
  *` selects these values:

  ```none
  a.c1, a.c2, a.c3, b.c1, b.c2, b.c3
  ```

  With an inner join, [`COALESCE(a.c1,
  b.c1)`](comparison-operators.md#function_coalesce) is the same as either
  `a.c1` or `b.c1` because
  both columns have the same value. With an outer join (such
  as `LEFT JOIN`), one of the two columns can
  be `NULL`. That column is omitted from the
  result.
- An `ON` clause can refer only to its
  operands.

  Example:

  ```sql
  CREATE TABLE t1 (i1 INT);
  CREATE TABLE t2 (i2 INT);
  CREATE TABLE t3 (i3 INT);
  SELECT * FROM t1 JOIN t2 ON (i1 = i3) JOIN t3;
  ```

  The statement fails with an `Unknown column 'i3' in
  'on clause'` error because `i3` is
  a column in `t3`, which is not an operand
  of the `ON` clause. To enable the join to
  be processed, rewrite the statement as follows:

  ```sql
  SELECT * FROM t1 JOIN t2 JOIN t3 ON (i1 = i3);
  ```
- `JOIN` has higher precedence than the comma
  operator (`,`), so the join expression
  `t1, t2 JOIN t3` is interpreted as
  `(t1, (t2 JOIN t3))`, not as `((t1,
  t2) JOIN t3)`. This affects statements that use an
  `ON` clause because that clause can refer
  only to columns in the operands of the join, and the
  precedence affects interpretation of what those operands
  are.

  Example:

  ```sql
  CREATE TABLE t1 (i1 INT, j1 INT);
  CREATE TABLE t2 (i2 INT, j2 INT);
  CREATE TABLE t3 (i3 INT, j3 INT);
  INSERT INTO t1 VALUES(1, 1);
  INSERT INTO t2 VALUES(1, 1);
  INSERT INTO t3 VALUES(1, 1);
  SELECT * FROM t1, t2 JOIN t3 ON (t1.i1 = t3.i3);
  ```

  The `JOIN` takes precedence over the comma
  operator, so the operands for the `ON`
  clause are `t2` and `t3`.
  Because `t1.i1` is not a column in either
  of the operands, the result is an `Unknown column
  't1.i1' in 'on clause'` error.

  To enable the join to be processed, use either of these
  strategies:

  - Group the first two tables explicitly with parentheses
    so that the operands for the `ON`
    clause are `(t1, t2)` and
    `t3`:

    ```sql
    SELECT * FROM (t1, t2) JOIN t3 ON (t1.i1 = t3.i3);
    ```
  - Avoid the use of the comma operator and use
    `JOIN` instead:

    ```sql
    SELECT * FROM t1 JOIN t2 JOIN t3 ON (t1.i1 = t3.i3);
    ```

  The same precedence interpretation also applies to
  statements that mix the comma operator with `INNER
  JOIN`, `CROSS JOIN`, `LEFT
  JOIN`, and `RIGHT JOIN`, all of
  which have higher precedence than the comma operator.
- A MySQL extension compared to the SQL:2003 standard is that
  MySQL permits you to qualify the common (coalesced) columns
  of `NATURAL` or `USING`
  joins, whereas the standard disallows that.
