#### 19.5.1.7 Replication of CREATE TABLE ... SELECT Statements

MySQL applies these rules when
[`CREATE
TABLE ... SELECT`](create-table-select.md "15.1.20.4 CREATE TABLE ... SELECT Statement") statements are replicated:

- [`CREATE
  TABLE ... SELECT`](create-table-select.md "15.1.20.4 CREATE TABLE ... SELECT Statement") always performs an implicit
  commit ([Section 15.3.3, “Statements That Cause an Implicit Commit”](implicit-commit.md "15.3.3 Statements That Cause an Implicit Commit")).
- If the destination table does not exist, logging occurs as
  follows. It does not matter whether `IF NOT
  EXISTS` is present.

  - `STATEMENT` or `MIXED`
    format: The statement is logged as written.
  - `ROW` format: The statement is logged
    as a [`CREATE TABLE`](create-table.md "15.1.20 CREATE TABLE Statement")
    statement followed by a series of insert-row events.

    Prior to MySQL 8.0.21, the statement is logged as two
    transactions. As of MySQL 8.0.21, on storage engines
    that support atomic DDL, it is logged as one
    transaction. For more information, see
    [Section 15.1.1, “Atomic Data Definition Statement Support”](atomic-ddl.md "15.1.1 Atomic Data Definition Statement Support").
- If the
  [`CREATE
  TABLE ... SELECT`](create-table-select.md "15.1.20.4 CREATE TABLE ... SELECT Statement") statement fails, nothing is
  logged. This includes the case that the destination table
  exists and `IF NOT EXISTS` is not given.
- If the destination table exists and `IF NOT
  EXISTS` is given, MySQL 8.0 ignores
  the statement completely; nothing is inserted or logged.

MySQL 8.0 does not allow a
[`CREATE
TABLE ... SELECT`](create-table-select.md "15.1.20.4 CREATE TABLE ... SELECT Statement") statement to make any changes in
tables other than the table that is created by the statement.
