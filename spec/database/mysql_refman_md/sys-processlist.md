#### 30.4.3.22 The processlist and x$processlist Views

The MySQL process list indicates the operations currently
being performed by the set of threads executing within the
server. The [`processlist`](sys-processlist.md "30.4.3.22 The processlist and x$processlist Views") and
[`x$processlist`](sys-processlist.md "30.4.3.22 The processlist and x$processlist Views") views summarize
process information. They provide more complete information
than the [`SHOW PROCESSLIST`](show-processlist.md "15.7.7.29 SHOW PROCESSLIST Statement")
statement and the `INFORMATION_SCHEMA`
[`PROCESSLIST`](information-schema-processlist-table.md "28.3.23 The INFORMATION_SCHEMA PROCESSLIST Table") table, and are also
nonblocking. By default, rows are sorted by descending process
time and descending wait time. For a comparison of process
information sources, see
[Sources of Process Information](processlist-access.md#processlist-sources "Sources of Process Information").

The column descriptions here are brief. For additional
information, see the description of the Performance Schema
[`threads`](performance-schema-threads-table.md "29.12.21.8 The threads Table") table at
[Section 29.12.21.8, “The threads Table”](performance-schema-threads-table.md "29.12.21.8 The threads Table").

The [`processlist`](sys-processlist.md "30.4.3.22 The processlist and x$processlist Views") and
[`x$processlist`](sys-processlist.md "30.4.3.22 The processlist and x$processlist Views") views have these
columns:

- `thd_id`

  The thread ID.
- `conn_id`

  The connection ID.
- `user`

  The thread user or thread name.
- `db`

  The default database for the thread, or
  `NULL` if there is none.
- `command`

  For foreground threads, the type of command the thread is
  executing on behalf of the client, or
  `Sleep` if the session is idle.
- `state`

  An action, event, or state that indicates what the thread
  is doing.
- `time`

  The time in seconds that the thread has been in its
  current state.
- `current_statement`

  The statement the thread is executing, or
  `NULL` if it is not executing any
  statement.
- `execution_engine`

  The query execution engine. The value is either
  `PRIMARY` or
  `SECONDARY`. For use with MySQL HeatWave Service and
  MySQL HeatWave, where the `PRIMARY` engine is
  `InnoDB` and `SECONDARY`
  engine is MySQL HeatWave (`RAPID`). For MySQL Community Edition
  Server, MySQL Enterprise Edition Server (on-premise), and MySQL HeatWave Service without
  MySQL HeatWave, the value is always `PRIMARY`.
  This column was added in MySQL 8.0.29.
- `statement_latency`

  How long the statement has been executing.
- `progress`

  The percentage of work completed for stages that support
  progress reporting. See
  [Section 30.3, “sys Schema Progress Reporting”](sys-schema-progress-reporting.md "30.3 sys Schema Progress Reporting").
- `lock_latency`

  The time spent waiting for locks by the current statement.
- `cpu_latency`

  The time spent on CPU for the current thread.
- `rows_examined`

  The number of rows read from storage engines by the
  current statement.
- `rows_sent`

  The number of rows returned by the current statement.
- `rows_affected`

  The number of rows affected by the current statement.
- `tmp_tables`

  The number of internal in-memory temporary tables created
  by the current statement.
- `tmp_disk_tables`

  The number of internal on-disk temporary tables created by
  the current statement.
- `full_scan`

  The number of full table scans performed by the current
  statement.
- `last_statement`

  The last statement executed by the thread, if there is no
  currently executing statement or wait.
- `last_statement_latency`

  How long the last statement executed.
- `current_memory`

  The number of bytes allocated by the thread.
- `last_wait`

  The name of the most recent wait event for the thread.
- `last_wait_latency`

  The wait time of the most recent wait event for the
  thread.
- `source`

  The source file and line number containing the
  instrumented code that produced the event.
- `trx_latency`

  The wait time of the current transaction for the thread.
- `trx_state`

  The state for the current transaction for the thread.
