#### 29.12.11.8 The replication\_asynchronous\_connection\_failover Table

This table holds the replica's source lists for each
replication channel for the asynchronous connection failover
mechanism. The asynchronous connection failover mechanism
automatically establishes an asynchronous (source to replica)
replication connection to a new source from the appropriate
list after the existing connection from the replica to its
source fails. When asynchronous connection failover is enabled
for a group of replicas managed by Group Replication, the
source lists are broadcast to all group members when they
join, and also when the lists change.

You set and manage source lists using the
[`asynchronous_connection_failover_add_source`](replication-functions-async-failover.md#function_asynchronous-connection-failover-add-source)
and
[`asynchronous_connection_failover_delete_source`](replication-functions-async-failover.md#function_asynchronous-connection-failover-delete-source)
functions to add and remove replication source servers from
the source list for a replication channel. To add and remove
managed groups of servers, use the
[`asynchronous_connection_failover_add_managed`](replication-functions-async-failover.md#function_asynchronous-connection-failover-add-managed)
and
[`asynchronous_connection_failover_delete_managed`](replication-functions-async-failover.md#function_asynchronous-connection-failover-delete-managed)
functions instead.

[Section 19.4.9, “Switching Sources and Replicas with Asynchronous Connection Failover”](replication-asynchronous-connection-failover.md "19.4.9 Switching Sources and Replicas with Asynchronous Connection Failover").

The
[`replication_asynchronous_connection_failover`](performance-schema-replication-asynchronous-connection-failover-table.md "29.12.11.8 The replication_asynchronous_connection_failover Table")
table has these columns:

- `CHANNEL_NAME`

  The replication channel for which this replication source
  server is part of the source list. If this channel's
  connection to its current source fails, this replication
  source server is one of its potential new sources.
- `HOST`

  The host name for this replication source server.
- `PORT`

  The port number for this replication source server.
- `NETWORK_NAMESPACE`

  The network namespace for this replication source server.
  If this value is empty, connections use the default
  (global) namespace.
- `WEIGHT`

  The priority of this replication source server in the
  replication channel's source list. The weight is from
  1 to 100, with 100 being the highest, and 50 being the
  default. When the asynchronous connection failover
  mechanism activates, the source with the highest weight
  setting among the alternative sources listed in the source
  list for the channel is chosen for the first connection
  attempt. If this attempt does not work, the replica tries
  with all the listed sources in descending order of weight,
  then starts again from the highest weighted source. If
  multiple sources have the same weight, the replica orders
  them randomly.
- `MANAGED_NAME`

  The identifier for the managed group that the server is a
  part of. For the `GroupReplication`
  managed service, the identifier is the value of the
  [`group_replication_group_name`](group-replication-system-variables.md#sysvar_group_replication_group_name)
  system variable.

The
[`replication_asynchronous_connection_failover`](performance-schema-replication-asynchronous-connection-failover-table.md "29.12.11.8 The replication_asynchronous_connection_failover Table")
table has these indexes:

- Primary key on (`CHANNEL_NAME, HOST, PORT,
  NETWORK_NAMESPACE, MANAGED_NAME`)

[`TRUNCATE TABLE`](truncate-table.md "15.1.37 TRUNCATE TABLE Statement") is not permitted
for the
[`replication_asynchronous_connection_failover`](performance-schema-replication-asynchronous-connection-failover-table.md "29.12.11.8 The replication_asynchronous_connection_failover Table")
