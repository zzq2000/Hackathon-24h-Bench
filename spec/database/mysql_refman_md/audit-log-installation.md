#### 8.4.5.2 Installing or Uninstalling MySQL Enterprise Audit

This section describes how to install or uninstall MySQL Enterprise Audit,
which is implemented using the audit log plugin and related
elements described in [Section 8.4.5.1, “Elements of MySQL Enterprise Audit”](audit-log-elements.md "8.4.5.1 Elements of MySQL Enterprise Audit"). For
general information about installing plugins, see
[Section 7.6.1, “Installing and Uninstalling Plugins”](plugin-loading.md "7.6.1 Installing and Uninstalling Plugins").

Plugin upgrades are not automatic when you upgrade a MySQL
installation and some plugin loadable functions must be loaded
manually (see [Installing Loadable Functions](function-loading.md#loadable-function-installing "Installing Loadable Functions")).
Alternatively, you can reinstall the plugin after upgrading
MySQL to load new functions.

Important

Read this entire section before following its instructions.
Parts of the procedure differ depending on your environment.

Note

If installed, the `audit_log` plugin involves
some minimal overhead even when disabled. To avoid this
overhead, do not install MySQL Enterprise Audit unless you plan to use it.

To be usable by the server, the plugin library file must be
located in the MySQL plugin directory (the directory named by
the [`plugin_dir`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_plugin_dir) system
variable). If necessary, configure the plugin directory location
by setting the value of
[`plugin_dir`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_plugin_dir) at server startup.

To install MySQL Enterprise Audit, look in the `share`
directory of your MySQL installation and choose the script that
is appropriate for your platform. The available scripts differ
in the file name used to refer to the script:

- `audit_log_filter_win_install.sql`
- `audit_log_filter_linux_install.sql`

Run the script as follows. The example here uses the Linux
installation script. Make the appropriate substitution for your
system.

Prior to MySQL 8.0.34:

```terminal
$> mysql -u root -p < audit_log_filter_linux_install.sql
Enter password: (enter root password here)
```

MySQL 8.0.34 and higher:

```terminal
$> mysql -u root -p -D mysql < audit_log_filter_linux_install.sql
Enter password: (enter root password here)
```

Starting in MySQL 8.0.34, it is possible to select a database
for storing JSON filter tables when you run the installation
script. Create the database first; its name should not exceed 64
characters. For example:

```sql
mysql> CREATE DATABASE IF NOT EXISTS database-name;
```

Next, run the script using the alternative database name.

```terminal
$> mysql -u root -p -D database-name < audit_log_filter_linux_install.sql
Enter password: (enter root password here)
```

Note

Some MySQL versions have introduced changes to the structure
of the MySQL Enterprise Audit tables. To ensure that your tables are up to
date for upgrades from earlier versions of MySQL
8.0, perform the MySQL upgrade procedure, making
sure to use the option that forces an update (see
[Chapter 3, *Upgrading MySQL*](upgrading.md "Chapter 3 Upgrading MySQL")). If you prefer to run the update
statements only for the MySQL Enterprise Audit tables, see the following
discussion.

As of MySQL 8.0.12, for new MySQL installations, the
`USER` and `HOST` columns in
the `audit_log_user` table used by MySQL Enterprise Audit
have definitions that better correspond to the definitions of
the `User` and `Host`
columns in the `mysql.user` system table. For
upgrades to an installation for which MySQL Enterprise Audit is already
installed, it is recommended that you alter the table
definitions as follows:

```sql
ALTER TABLE mysql.audit_log_user
  DROP FOREIGN KEY audit_log_user_ibfk_1;
ALTER TABLE mysql.audit_log_filter
  CONVERT TO CHARACTER SET utf8mb4 COLLATE utf8mb4_0900_as_ci;
ALTER TABLE mysql.audit_log_user
  CONVERT TO CHARACTER SET utf8mb4 COLLATE utf8mb4_0900_as_ci;
ALTER TABLE mysql.audit_log_user
  MODIFY COLUMN USER VARCHAR(32);
ALTER TABLE mysql.audit_log_user
  ADD FOREIGN KEY (FILTERNAME) REFERENCES mysql.audit_log_filter(NAME);
```

Note

To use MySQL Enterprise Audit in the context of source/replica replication,
Group Replication, or InnoDB Cluster, you must prepare the
replica nodes prior to running the installation script on the
source node. This is necessary because the
[`INSTALL PLUGIN`](install-plugin.md "15.7.4.4 INSTALL PLUGIN Statement") statement in the
script is not replicated.

1. On each replica node, extract the
   [`INSTALL PLUGIN`](install-plugin.md "15.7.4.4 INSTALL PLUGIN Statement") statement
   from the installation script and execute it manually.
2. On the source node, run the installation script as
   described previously.

To verify plugin installation, examine the Information Schema
[`PLUGINS`](information-schema-plugins-table.md "28.3.22 The INFORMATION_SCHEMA PLUGINS Table") table or use the
[`SHOW PLUGINS`](show-plugins.md "15.7.7.25 SHOW PLUGINS Statement") statement (see
[Section 7.6.2, “Obtaining Server Plugin Information”](obtaining-plugin-information.md "7.6.2 Obtaining Server Plugin Information")). For example:

```sql
mysql> SELECT PLUGIN_NAME, PLUGIN_STATUS
       FROM INFORMATION_SCHEMA.PLUGINS
       WHERE PLUGIN_NAME LIKE 'audit%';
+-------------+---------------+
| PLUGIN_NAME | PLUGIN_STATUS |
+-------------+---------------+
| audit_log   | ACTIVE        |
+-------------+---------------+
```

If the plugin fails to initialize, check the server error log
for diagnostic messages.

After MySQL Enterprise Audit is installed, you can use the
[`--audit-log`](audit-log-reference.md#option_mysqld_audit-log) option for subsequent
server startups to control `audit_log` plugin
activation. For example, to prevent the plugin from being
removed at runtime, use this option:

```ini
[mysqld]
audit-log=FORCE_PLUS_PERMANENT
```

If it is desired to prevent the server from running without the
audit plugin, use [`--audit-log`](audit-log-reference.md#option_mysqld_audit-log)
with a value of `FORCE` or
`FORCE_PLUS_PERMANENT` to force server startup
to fail if the plugin does not initialize successfully.

Important

By default, rule-based audit log filtering logs no auditable
events for any users. This differs from legacy audit log
behavior, which logs all auditable events for all users (see
[Section 8.4.5.10, “Legacy Mode Audit Log Filtering”](audit-log-legacy-filtering.md "8.4.5.10 Legacy Mode Audit Log Filtering")). Should you wish
to produce log-everything behavior with rule-based filtering,
create a simple filter to enable logging and assign it to the
default account:

```sql
SELECT audit_log_filter_set_filter('log_all', '{ "filter": { "log": true } }');
SELECT audit_log_filter_set_user('%', 'log_all');
```

The filter assigned to `%` is used for
connections from any account that has no explicitly assigned
filter (which initially is true for all accounts).

When installed as just described, MySQL Enterprise Audit remains installed
until uninstalled. To remove it in MySQL 8.0.35 and later, run
the uninstall script located in the `share`
directory of your MySQL installation. The example here specifies
the default system database, `mysql`. Make the
appropriate substitution for your system.

```terminal
$> mysql -u root -p -D mysql < audit_log_filter_uninstall.sql
Enter password: (enter root password here)
```

If the script is not available, execute the following statements
to remove the tables, plugin, and functions manually.

```sql
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS mysql.audit_log_user;
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS mysql.audit_log_filter;
UNINSTALL PLUGIN audit_log;
DROP FUNCTION audit_log_filter_set_filter;
DROP FUNCTION audit_log_filter_remove_filter;
DROP FUNCTION audit_log_filter_set_user;
DROP FUNCTION audit_log_filter_remove_user;
DROP FUNCTION audit_log_filter_flush;
DROP FUNCTION audit_log_encryption_password_get;
DROP FUNCTION audit_log_encryption_password_set;
DROP FUNCTION audit_log_read;
DROP FUNCTION audit_log_read_bookmark;
DROP FUNCTION audit_log_rotate;
```
