#### 14.18.1.4 Functions to Inspect and Set the Group Replication Communication Protocol Version

The following functions enable you to inspect and configure
the Group Replication communication protocol version that is
used by a replication group.

- Versions from MySQL 5.7.14 allow compression of messages
  (see
  [Section 20.7.4, “Message Compression”](group-replication-message-compression.md "20.7.4 Message Compression")).
- Versions from MySQL 8.0.16 also allow fragmentation of
  messages (see
  [Section 20.7.5, “Message Fragmentation”](group-replication-performance-message-fragmentation.md "20.7.5 Message Fragmentation")).
- Versions from MySQL 8.0.27 also allow the group
  communication engine to operate with a single consensus
  leader when the group is in single-primary mode and
  [`group_replication_paxos_single_leader`](group-replication-system-variables.md#sysvar_group_replication_paxos_single_leader)
  is set to true (see
  [Section 20.7.3, “Single Consensus Leader”](group-replication-single-consensus-leader.md "20.7.3 Single Consensus Leader")).

- [`group_replication_get_communication_protocol()`](group-replication-functions-for-communication-protocol.md#function_group-replication-get-communication-protocol)

  Inspect the Group Replication communication protocol
  version that is currently in use for a group.

  Syntax:

  ```clike
  STRING group_replication_get_communication_protocol()
  ```

  This function has no parameters.

  Return value:

  The oldest MySQL Server version that can join this group
  and use the group's communication protocol. Note that
  the
  [`group_replication_get_communication_protocol()`](group-replication-functions-for-communication-protocol.md#function_group-replication-get-communication-protocol)
  function returns the minimum MySQL version that the group
  supports, which might differ from the version number that
  was passed to
  [`group_replication_set_communication_protocol()`](group-replication-functions-for-communication-protocol.md#function_group-replication-set-communication-protocol),
  and from the MySQL Server version that is installed on the
  member where you use the function.

  If the protocol cannot be inspected because this server
  instance does not belong to a replication group, an error
  is returned as a string.

  Example:

  ```sql
  SELECT group_replication_get_communication_protocol();
  +------------------------------------------------+
  | group_replication_get_communication_protocol() |
  +------------------------------------------------+
  | 8.0.45                                          |
  +------------------------------------------------+
  ```

  For more information, see
  [Section 20.5.1.4, “Setting a Group's Communication Protocol Version”](group-replication-communication-protocol.md "20.5.1.4 Setting a Group's Communication Protocol Version").
- [`group_replication_set_communication_protocol()`](group-replication-functions-for-communication-protocol.md#function_group-replication-set-communication-protocol)

  Downgrade the Group Replication communication protocol
  version of a group so that members at earlier releases can
  join, or upgrade the Group Replication communication
  protocol version of a group after upgrading MySQL Server
  on all members. The
  [`GROUP_REPLICATION_ADMIN`](privileges-provided.md#priv_group-replication-admin)
  privilege is required to use this function, and all
  existing group members must be online when you issue the
  statement, with no loss of majority.

  Note

  For MySQL InnoDB cluster, the communication protocol
  version is managed automatically whenever the cluster
  topology is changed using AdminAPI operations. You do
  not have to use these functions yourself for an InnoDB
  cluster.

  Syntax:

  ```clike
  STRING group_replication_set_communication_protocol(version)
  ```

  Arguments:

  - *`version`*: For a downgrade,
    specify the MySQL Server version of the prospective
    group member that has the oldest installed server
    version. In this case, the command makes the group
    fall back to a communication protocol compatible with
    that server version if possible. The minimum server
    version that you can specify is MySQL 5.7.14. For an
    upgrade, specify the new MySQL Server version to which
    the existing group members have been upgraded.

  Return value:

  A string containing the result of the operation, for
  example whether it was successful or not.

  Example:

  ```sql
  SELECT group_replication_set_communication_protocol("5.7.25");
  ```

  [Section 20.5.1.4, “Setting a Group's Communication Protocol Version”](group-replication-communication-protocol.md "20.5.1.4 Setting a Group's Communication Protocol Version").
