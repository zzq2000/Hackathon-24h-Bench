### 2.3.7 Windows Platform Restrictions

The following restrictions apply to use of MySQL on the Windows
platform:

- **Process memory**

  On Windows 32-bit platforms, it is not possible by default to
  use more than 2GB of RAM within a single process, including
  MySQL. This is because the physical address limit on Windows
  32-bit is 4GB and the default setting within Windows is to
  split the virtual address space between kernel (2GB) and
  user/applications (2GB).

  Some versions of Windows have a boot time setting to enable
  larger applications by reducing the kernel application.
  Alternatively, to use more than 2GB, use a 64-bit version of
  Windows.
- **File system aliases**

  When using `MyISAM` tables, you cannot use
  aliases within Windows link to the data files on another
  volume and then link back to the main MySQL
  [`datadir`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_datadir) location.

  This facility is often used to move the data and index files
  to a RAID or other fast solution.
- **Limited number of ports**

  Windows systems have about 4,000 ports available for client
  connections, and after a connection on a port closes, it takes
  two to four minutes before the port can be reused. In
  situations where clients connect to and disconnect from the
  server at a high rate, it is possible for all available ports
  to be used up before closed ports become available again. If
  this happens, the MySQL server appears to be unresponsive even
  though it is running. Ports may be used by other applications
  running on the machine as well, in which case the number of
  ports available to MySQL is lower.

  For more information about this problem, see
  <https://support.microsoft.com/kb/196271>.
- **`DATA DIRECTORY` and
  `INDEX DIRECTORY`**

  The `DATA DIRECTORY` clause of the
  [`CREATE TABLE`](create-table.md "15.1.20 CREATE TABLE Statement") statement is
  supported on Windows for `InnoDB` tables
  only, as described in
  [Section 17.6.1.2, “Creating Tables Externally”](innodb-create-table-external.md "17.6.1.2 Creating Tables Externally"). For
  `MyISAM` and other storage engines, the
  `DATA DIRECTORY` and `INDEX
  DIRECTORY` clauses for [`CREATE
  TABLE`](create-table.md "15.1.20 CREATE TABLE Statement") are ignored on Windows and any other platforms
  with a nonfunctional `realpath()` call.
- **[`DROP
  DATABASE`](drop-database.md "15.1.24 DROP DATABASE Statement")**

  You cannot drop a database that is in use by another session.
- **Case-insensitive names**

  File names are not case-sensitive on Windows, so MySQL
  database and table names are also not case-sensitive on
  Windows. The only restriction is that database and table names
  must be specified using the same case throughout a given
  statement. See [Section 11.2.3, “Identifier Case Sensitivity”](identifier-case-sensitivity.md "11.2.3 Identifier Case Sensitivity").
- **Directory and file names**

  On Windows, MySQL Server supports only directory and file
  names that are compatible with the current ANSI code pages.
  For example, the following Japanese directory name does not
  work in the Western locale (code page 1252):

  ```ini
  datadir="C:/私たちのプロジェクトのデータ"
  ```

  The same limitation applies to directory and file names
  referred to in SQL statements, such as the data file path name
  in [`LOAD DATA`](load-data.md "15.2.9 LOAD DATA Statement").
- **The `\` path name
  separator character**

  Path name components in Windows are separated by the
  `\` character, which is also the escape
  character in MySQL. If you are using [`LOAD
  DATA`](load-data.md "15.2.9 LOAD DATA Statement") or
  [`SELECT ... INTO
  OUTFILE`](select-into.md "15.2.13.1 SELECT ... INTO Statement"), use Unix-style file names with
  `/` characters:

  ```sql
  mysql> LOAD DATA INFILE 'C:/tmp/skr.txt' INTO TABLE skr;
  mysql> SELECT * INTO OUTFILE 'C:/tmp/skr.txt' FROM skr;
  ```

  Alternatively, you must double the `\`
  character:

  ```sql
  mysql> LOAD DATA INFILE 'C:\\tmp\\skr.txt' INTO TABLE skr;
  mysql> SELECT * INTO OUTFILE 'C:\\tmp\\skr.txt' FROM skr;
  ```
- **Problems with pipes**

  Pipes do not work reliably from the Windows command-line
  prompt. If the pipe includes the character
  `^Z` / `CHAR(24)`, Windows
  thinks that it has encountered end-of-file and aborts the
  program.

  This is mainly a problem when you try to apply a binary log as
  follows:

  ```terminal
  C:\> mysqlbinlog binary_log_file | mysql --user=root
  ```

  If you have a problem applying the log and suspect that it is
  because of a `^Z` /
  `CHAR(24)` character, you can use the
  following workaround:

  ```terminal
  C:\> mysqlbinlog binary_log_file --result-file=/tmp/bin.sql
  C:\> mysql --user=root --execute "source /tmp/bin.sql"
  ```

  The latter command also can be used to reliably read any SQL
  file that may contain binary data.
