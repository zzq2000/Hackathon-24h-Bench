When using a replication setup involving multiple sources
(including circular replication), it is possible that different
sources may try to update the same row on the replica with
different data. Conflict resolution in NDB Cluster Replication
provides a means of resolving such conflicts by permitting a
user-defined resolution column to be used to determine whether or
not an update on a given source should be applied on the replica.

Some types of conflict resolution supported by NDB Cluster
(`NDB$OLD()`, `NDB$MAX()`, and
`NDB$MAX_DELETE_WIN()`; additionally, in NDB
8.0.30 and later, `NDB$MAX_INS()` and
`NDB$MAX_DEL_WIN_INS()`) implement this
user-defined column as a “timestamp” column (although
its type cannot be [`TIMESTAMP`](datetime.md "13.2.2 The DATE, DATETIME, and TIMESTAMP Types"), as
explained later in this section). These types of conflict
resolution are always applied a row-by-row basis rather than a
transactional basis. The epoch-based conflict resolution functions
`NDB$EPOCH()` and
`NDB$EPOCH_TRANS()` compare the order in which
epochs are replicated (and thus these functions are
transactional). Different methods can be used to compare
resolution column values on the replica when conflicts occur, as
explained later in this section; the method used can be set to act
on a single table, database, or server, or on a set of one or more
tables using pattern matching. See
[Matching with wildcards](mysql-cluster-replication-schema.md#ndb-replication-wildcards "Matching with wildcards"), for information about
using pattern matches in the `db`,
`table_name`, and `server_id`
columns of the `mysql.ndb_replication` table.

You should also keep in mind that it is the application's
responsibility to ensure that the resolution column is correctly
populated with relevant values, so that the resolution function
can make the appropriate choice when determining whether to apply
an update.

#### Requirements

Preparations for conflict resolution must be made on both the
source and the replica. These tasks are described in the
following list:

- On the source writing the binary logs, you must determine
  which columns are sent (all columns or only those that have
  been updated). This is done for the MySQL Server as a whole
  by applying the [**mysqld**](mysqld.md "6.3.1 mysqld — The MySQL Server") startup option
  [`--ndb-log-updated-only`](mysql-cluster-options-variables.md#option_mysqld_ndb-log-updated-only)
  (described later in this section), or on one or more
  specific tables by placing the proper entries in the
  `mysql.ndb_replication` table (see
  [ndb\_replication Table](mysql-cluster-replication-schema.md#ndb-replication-ndb-replication "ndb_replication Table")).

  Note

  If you are replicating tables with very large columns
  (such as [`TEXT`](blob.md "13.3.4 The BLOB and TEXT Types") or
  [`BLOB`](blob.md "13.3.4 The BLOB and TEXT Types") columns),
  [`--ndb-log-updated-only`](mysql-cluster-options-variables.md#option_mysqld_ndb-log-updated-only) can
  also be useful for reducing the size of the binary logs
  and avoiding possible replication failures due to
  exceeding
  [`max_allowed_packet`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_max_allowed_packet).

  See
  [Section 19.5.1.20, “Replication and max\_allowed\_packet”](replication-features-max-allowed-packet.md "19.5.1.20 Replication and max_allowed_packet"),
  for more information about this issue.
- On the replica, you must determine which type of conflict
  resolution to apply (“latest timestamp wins”,
  “same timestamp wins”, “primary
  wins”, “primary wins, complete
  transaction”, or none). This is done using the
  `mysql.ndb_replication` system table, and
  applies to one or more specific tables (see
  [ndb\_replication Table](mysql-cluster-replication-schema.md#ndb-replication-ndb-replication "ndb_replication Table")).
- NDB Cluster also supports read conflict detection, that is,
  detecting conflicts between reads of a given row in one
  cluster and updates or deletes of the same row in another
  cluster. This requires exclusive read locks obtained by
  setting
  [`ndb_log_exclusive_reads`](mysql-cluster-options-variables.md#sysvar_ndb_log_exclusive_reads)
  equal to 1 on the replica. All rows read by a conflicting
  read are logged in the exceptions table. For more
  information, see
  [Read conflict detection and resolution](mysql-cluster-replication-conflict-resolution.md#conflict-resolution-read-conflicts "Read conflict detection and resolution").
- Prior to NDB 8.0.30, `NDB` applied
  `WRITE_ROW` events strictly as inserts,
  requiring that there was not already any such row; that is,
  an incoming write was always rejected if the row already
  existed. (This is still the case when using any conflict
  resolution function other than
  `NDB$MAX_INS()` or
  `NDB$MAX_DEL_WIN_INS()`.)

  Beginning with NDB 8.0.30, when using
  `NDB$MAX_INS()` or
  `NDB$MAX_DEL_WIN_INS()`,
  `NDB` can apply
  `WRITE_ROW` events idempotently, mapping
  such an event to an insert when the incoming row does not
  already exist, or to an update if it does.

When using the functions `NDB$OLD()`,
`NDB$MAX()`, and
`NDB$MAX_DELETE_WIN()` for timestamp-based
conflict resolution (as well as `NDB$MAX_INS()`
and `NDB$MAX_DEL_WIN_INS()`, beginning with NDB
8.0.30), we often refer to the column used for determining
updates as a “timestamp” column. However, the data
type of this column is never
[`TIMESTAMP`](datetime.md "13.2.2 The DATE, DATETIME, and TIMESTAMP Types"); instead, its data type
should be [`INT`](integer-types.md "13.1.2 Integer Types (Exact Value) - INTEGER, INT, SMALLINT, TINYINT, MEDIUMINT, BIGINT")
([`INTEGER`](integer-types.md "13.1.2 Integer Types (Exact Value) - INTEGER, INT, SMALLINT, TINYINT, MEDIUMINT, BIGINT")) or
[`BIGINT`](integer-types.md "13.1.2 Integer Types (Exact Value) - INTEGER, INT, SMALLINT, TINYINT, MEDIUMINT, BIGINT"). The
“timestamp” column should also be
`UNSIGNED` and `NOT NULL`.

The `NDB$EPOCH()` and
`NDB$EPOCH_TRANS()` functions discussed later
in this section work by comparing the relative order of
replication epochs applied on a primary and secondary NDB
Cluster, and do not make use of timestamps.

#### Source Column Control

We can see update operations in terms of “before”
and “after” images—that is, the states of the
table before and after the update is applied. Normally, when
updating a table with a primary key, the “before”
image is not of great interest; however, when we need to
determine on a per-update basis whether or not to use the
updated values on a replica, we need to make sure that both
images are written to the source's binary log. This is done
with the
[`--ndb-log-update-as-write`](mysql-cluster-options-variables.md#option_mysqld_ndb-log-update-as-write) option
for [**mysqld**](mysqld.md "6.3.1 mysqld — The MySQL Server"), as described later in this
section.

Important

Whether logging of complete rows or of updated columns only is
done is decided when the MySQL server is started, and cannot
be changed online; you must either restart
[**mysqld**](mysqld.md "6.3.1 mysqld — The MySQL Server"), or start a new
[**mysqld**](mysqld.md "6.3.1 mysqld — The MySQL Server") instance with different logging
options.

#### Conflict Resolution Control

Conflict resolution is usually enabled on the server where
conflicts can occur. Like logging method selection, it is
enabled by entries in the
`mysql.ndb_replication` table.

`NBT_UPDATED_ONLY_MINIMAL` and
`NBT_UPDATED_FULL_MINIMAL` can be used with
`NDB$EPOCH()`, `NDB$EPOCH2()`,
and `NDB$EPOCH_TRANS()`, because these do not
require “before” values of columns which are not
primary keys. Conflict resolution algorithms requiring the old
values, such as `NDB$MAX()` and
`NDB$OLD()`, do not work correctly with these
`binlog_type` values.

#### Conflict Resolution Functions

This section provides detailed information about the functions
which can be used for conflict detection and resolution with NDB
Replication.

- [NDB$OLD()](mysql-cluster-replication-conflict-resolution.md#mysql-cluster-replication-ndb-old "NDB$OLD()")
- [NDB$MAX()](mysql-cluster-replication-conflict-resolution.md#mysql-cluster-replication-ndb-max "NDB$MAX()")
- [NDB$MAX\_DELETE\_WIN()](mysql-cluster-replication-conflict-resolution.md#mysql-cluster-replication-ndb-max-delete-win "NDB$MAX_DELETE_WIN()")
- [NDB$MAX\_INS()](mysql-cluster-replication-conflict-resolution.md#mysql-cluster-replication-ndb-max-ins "NDB$MAX_INS()")
- [NDB$MAX\_DEL\_WIN\_INS()](mysql-cluster-replication-conflict-resolution.md#mysql-cluster-replication-ndb-max-del-win-ins "NDB$MAX_DEL_WIN_INS()")
- [NDB$EPOCH()](mysql-cluster-replication-conflict-resolution.md#mysql-cluster-replication-ndb-epoch "NDB$EPOCH()")
- [NDB$EPOCH\_TRANS()](mysql-cluster-replication-conflict-resolution.md#mysql-cluster-replication-ndb-epoch-trans "NDB$EPOCH_TRANS()")
- [NDB$EPOCH2()](mysql-cluster-replication-conflict-resolution.md#mysql-cluster-replication-ndb-epoch2 "NDB$EPOCH2()")
- [NDB$EPOCH2\_TRANS()](mysql-cluster-replication-conflict-resolution.md#mysql-cluster-replication-ndb-epoch2-trans "NDB$EPOCH2_TRANS()")

##### NDB$OLD()

If the value of *`column_name`* is the
same on both the source and the replica, then the update is
applied; otherwise, the update is not applied on the replica and
an exception is written to the log. This is illustrated by the
following pseudocode:

```clike
if (source_old_column_value == replica_current_column_value)
  apply_update();
else
  log_exception();
```

This function can be used for “same value wins”
conflict resolution. This type of conflict resolution ensures
that updates are not applied on the replica from the wrong
source.

Important

The column value from the source's “before”
image is used by this function.

##### NDB$MAX()

For an update or delete operation, if the
“timestamp” column value for a given row coming
from the source is higher than that on the replica, it is
applied; otherwise it is not applied on the replica. This is
illustrated by the following pseudocode:

```clike
if (source_new_column_value > replica_current_column_value)
  apply_update();
```

This function can be used for “greatest timestamp
wins” conflict resolution. This type of conflict
resolution ensures that, in the event of a conflict, the version
of the row that was most recently updated is the version that
persists.

This function has no effects on conflicts between write
operations, other than that a write operation with the same
primary key as a previous write is always rejected; it is
accepted and applied only if no write operation using the same
primary key already exists. Beginning with NDB 8.0.30, you can
use
`NDB$MAX_INS()`
to handle conflict resolution between writes.

Important

The column value from the sources's “after”
image is used by this function.

##### NDB$MAX\_DELETE\_WIN()

This is a variation on `NDB$MAX()`. Due to the
fact that no timestamp is available for a delete operation, a
delete using `NDB$MAX()` is in fact processed
as `NDB$OLD`, but for some use cases, this is
not optimal. For `NDB$MAX_DELETE_WIN()`, if the
“timestamp” column value for a given row adding or
updating an existing row coming from the source is higher than
that on the replica, it is applied. However, delete operations
are treated as always having the higher value. This is
illustrated by the following pseudocode:

```clike
if ( (source_new_column_value > replica_current_column_value)
        ||
      operation.type == "delete")
  apply_update();
```

This function can be used for “greatest timestamp, delete
wins” conflict resolution. This type of conflict
resolution ensures that, in the event of a conflict, the version
of the row that was deleted or (otherwise) most recently updated
is the version that persists.

Note

As with `NDB$MAX()`, the column value from
the source's “after” image is the value used
by this function.

##### NDB$MAX\_INS()

This function provides support for resolution of conflicting
write operations. Such conflicts are handled by
“NDB$MAX\_INS()” as follows:

1. If there is no conflicting write, apply this one (this is
   the same as `NDB$MAX()`).
2. Otherwise, apply “greatest timestamp wins”
   conflict resolution, as follows:

   1. If the timestamp for the incoming write is greater than
      that of the conflicting write, apply the incoming
      operation.
   2. If the timestamp for the incoming write is
      *not* greater, reject the incoming
      write operation.

When handling an insert operation,
`NDB$MAX_INS()` compares timestamps from the
source and replica as illustrated by the following pseudocode:

```clike
if (source_new_column_value > replica_current_column_value)
  apply_insert();
else
  log_exception();
```

For an update operation, the updated timestamp column value from
the source is compared with the replica's timestamp column
value, as shown here:

```clike
if (source_new_column_value > replica_current_column_value)
  apply_update();
else
  log_exception();
```

This is the same as performed by
`NDB$MAX()`.

For delete operations, the handling is also the same as that
performed by `NDB$MAX()` (and thus the same as
`NDB$OLD()`), and is done like this:

```clike
if (source_new_column_value == replica_current_column_value)
  apply_delete();
else
  log_exception();
```

`NDB$MAX_INS()` was added in NDB 8.0.30.

##### NDB$MAX\_DEL\_WIN\_INS()

This function provides support for resolution of conflicting
write operations, along with “delete wins”
resolution like that of
`NDB$MAX_DELETE_WIN()`.
Write conflicts are handled by
`NDB$MAX_DEL_WIN_INS()` as shown here:

1. If there is no conflicting write, apply this one (this is
   the same as `NDB$MAX_DELETE_WIN()`).
2. Otherwise, apply “greatest timestamp wins”
   conflict resolution, as follows:

   1. If the timestamp for the incoming write is greater than
      that of the conflicting write, apply the incoming
      operation.
   2. If the timestamp for the incoming write is
      *not* greater, reject the incoming
      write operation.

Handling of insert operations as performed by
`NDB$MAX_DEL_WIN_INS()` can be represented in
pseudocode as shown here:

```clike
if (source_new_column_value > replica_current_column_value)
  apply_insert();
else
  log_exception();
```

For update operations, the source's updated timestamp
column value is compared with replica's timestamp column
value, like this (again using pseudocode):

```clike
if (source_new_column_value > replica_current_column_value)
  apply_update();
else
  log_exception();
```

Deletes are handled using a “delete always wins”
strategy (the same as `NDB$MAX_DELETE_WIN()`);
a `DELETE` is always applied without any regard
to any timestamp values, as illustrated by this pseudocode:

```clike
if (operation.type == "delete")
  apply_delete();
```

For conflicts between update and delete operations, this
function behaves identically to
`NDB$MAX_DELETE_WIN()`.

`NDB$MAX_DEL_WIN_INS()` was added in NDB
8.0.30.

##### NDB$EPOCH()

The `NDB$EPOCH()` function tracks the order in
which replicated epochs are applied on a replica cluster
relative to changes originating on the replica. This relative
ordering is used to determine whether changes originating on the
replica are concurrent with any changes that originate locally,
and are therefore potentially in conflict.

Most of what follows in the description of
`NDB$EPOCH()` also applies to
`NDB$EPOCH_TRANS()`. Any exceptions are noted
in the text.

`NDB$EPOCH()` is asymmetric, operating on one
NDB Cluster in a bidirectional replication configuration
(sometimes referred to as “active-active”
replication). We refer here to cluster on which it operates as
the primary, and the other as the secondary. The replica on the
primary is responsible for detecting and handling conflicts,
while the replica on the secondary is not involved in any
conflict detection or handling.

When the replica on the primary detects conflicts, it injects
events into its own binary log to compensate for these; this
ensures that the secondary NDB Cluster eventually realigns
itself with the primary and so keeps the primary and secondary
from diverging. This compensation and realignment mechanism
requires that the primary NDB Cluster always wins any conflicts
with the secondary—that is, that the primary's
changes are always used rather than those from the secondary in
event of a conflict. This “primary always wins”
rule has the following implications:

- Operations that change data, once committed on the primary,
  are fully persistent and are not undone or rolled back by
  conflict detection and resolution.
- Data read from the primary is fully consistent. Any changes
  committed on the Primary (locally or from the replica) are
  not reverted later.
- Operations that change data on the secondary may later be
  reverted if the primary determines that they are in
  conflict.
- Individual rows read on the secondary are self-consistent at
  all times, each row always reflecting either a state
  committed by the secondary, or one committed by the primary.
- Sets of rows read on the secondary may not necessarily be
  consistent at a given single point in time. For
  `NDB$EPOCH_TRANS()`, this is a transient
  state; for `NDB$EPOCH()`, it can be a
  persistent state.
- Assuming a period of sufficient length without any
  conflicts, all data on the secondary NDB Cluster
  (eventually) becomes consistent with the primary's
  data.

`NDB$EPOCH()` and
`NDB$EPOCH_TRANS()` do not require any user
schema modifications, or application changes to provide conflict
detection. However, careful thought must be given to the schema
used, and the access patterns used, to verify that the complete
system behaves within specified limits.

Each of the `NDB$EPOCH()` and
`NDB$EPOCH_TRANS()` functions can take an
optional parameter; this is the number of bits to use to
represent the lower 32 bits of the epoch, and should be set to
no less than the value calculated as shown here:

```sql
CEIL( LOG2( TimeBetweenGlobalCheckpoints / TimeBetweenEpochs ), 1)
```

For the default values of these configuration parameters (2000
and 100 milliseconds, respectively), this gives a value of 5
bits, so the default value (6) should be sufficient, unless
other values are used for
[`TimeBetweenGlobalCheckpoints`](mysql-cluster-ndbd-definition.md#ndbparam-ndbd-timebetweenglobalcheckpoints),
[`TimeBetweenEpochs`](mysql-cluster-ndbd-definition.md#ndbparam-ndbd-timebetweenepochs), or
both. A value that is too small can result in false positives,
while one that is too large could lead to excessive wasted space
in the database.

Both `NDB$EPOCH()` and
`NDB$EPOCH_TRANS()` insert entries for
conflicting rows into the relevant exceptions tables, provided
that these tables have been defined according to the same
exceptions table schema rules as described elsewhere in this
section (see
[NDB$OLD()](mysql-cluster-replication-conflict-resolution.md#mysql-cluster-replication-ndb-old "NDB$OLD()")). You must
create any exceptions table before creating the data table with
which it is to be used.

As with the other conflict detection functions discussed in this
section, `NDB$EPOCH()` and
`NDB$EPOCH_TRANS()` are activated by including
relevant entries in the `mysql.ndb_replication`
table (see [ndb\_replication Table](mysql-cluster-replication-schema.md#ndb-replication-ndb-replication "ndb_replication Table")).
The roles of the primary and secondary NDB Clusters in this
scenario are fully determined by
`mysql.ndb_replication` table entries.

Because the conflict detection algorithms employed by
`NDB$EPOCH()` and
`NDB$EPOCH_TRANS()` are asymmetric, you must
use different values for the `server_id`
entries of the primary and secondary replicas.

A conflict between `DELETE` operations alone is
not sufficient to trigger a conflict using
`NDB$EPOCH()` or
`NDB$EPOCH_TRANS()`, and the relative placement
within epochs does not matter.

**Limitations on NDB$EPOCH()**

The following limitations currently apply when using
`NDB$EPOCH()` to perform conflict detection:

- Conflicts are detected using NDB Cluster epoch boundaries,
  with granularity proportional to
  [`TimeBetweenEpochs`](mysql-cluster-ndbd-definition.md#ndbparam-ndbd-timebetweenepochs)
  (default: 100 milliseconds). The minimum conflict window is
  the minimum time during which concurrent updates to the same
  data on both clusters always report a conflict. This is
  always a nonzero length of time, and is roughly proportional
  to `2 * (latency + queueing +
  TimeBetweenEpochs)`. This implies
  that—assuming the default for
  [`TimeBetweenEpochs`](mysql-cluster-ndbd-definition.md#ndbparam-ndbd-timebetweenepochs)
  and ignoring any latency between clusters (as well as any
  queuing delays)—the minimum conflict window size is
  approximately 200 milliseconds. This minimum window should
  be considered when looking at expected application
  “race” patterns.
- Additional storage is required for tables using the
  `NDB$EPOCH()` and
  `NDB$EPOCH_TRANS()` functions; from 1 to 32
  bits extra space per row is required, depending on the value
  passed to the function.
- Conflicts between delete operations may result in divergence
  between the primary and secondary. When a row is deleted on
  both clusters concurrently, the conflict can be detected,
  but is not recorded, since the row is deleted. This means
  that further conflicts during the propagation of any
  subsequent realignment operations are not detected, which
  can lead to divergence.

  Deletes should be externally serialized, or routed to one
  cluster only. Alternatively, a separate row should be
  updated transactionally with such deletes and any inserts
  that follow them, so that conflicts can be tracked across
  row deletes. This may require changes in applications.
- Only two NDB Clusters in a bidirectional
  “active-active” configuration are currently
  supported when using `NDB$EPOCH()` or
  `NDB$EPOCH_TRANS()` for conflict detection.
- Tables having [`BLOB`](blob.md "13.3.4 The BLOB and TEXT Types") or
  [`TEXT`](blob.md "13.3.4 The BLOB and TEXT Types") columns are not
  currently supported with `NDB$EPOCH()` or
  `NDB$EPOCH_TRANS()`.

##### NDB$EPOCH\_TRANS()

`NDB$EPOCH_TRANS()` extends the
`NDB$EPOCH()` function. Conflicts are detected
and handled in the same way using the “primary wins
all” rule (see
[NDB$EPOCH()](mysql-cluster-replication-conflict-resolution.md#mysql-cluster-replication-ndb-epoch "NDB$EPOCH()")) but with
the extra condition that any other rows updated in the same
transaction in which the conflict occurred are also regarded as
being in conflict. In other words, where
`NDB$EPOCH()` realigns individual conflicting
rows on the secondary, `NDB$EPOCH_TRANS()`
realigns conflicting transactions.

In addition, any transactions which are detectably dependent on
a conflicting transaction are also regarded as being in
conflict, these dependencies being determined by the contents of
the secondary cluster's binary log. Since the binary log
contains only data modification operations (inserts, updates,
and deletes), only overlapping data modifications are used to
determine dependencies between transactions.

`NDB$EPOCH_TRANS()` is subject to the same
conditions and limitations as `NDB$EPOCH()`,
and in addition requires that all transaction IDs are recorded
in the secondary's binary log, using
[`--ndb-log-transaction-id`](mysql-cluster-options-variables.md#option_mysqld_ndb-log-transaction-id) set to
`ON`. This adds a variable amount of overhead
(up to 13 bytes per row).

The deprecated
[`log_bin_use_v1_row_events`](replication-options-binary-log.md#sysvar_log_bin_use_v1_row_events)
system variable, which defaults to `OFF`, must
*not* be set to `ON` with
`NDB$EPOCH_TRANS()`.

See [NDB$EPOCH()](mysql-cluster-replication-conflict-resolution.md#mysql-cluster-replication-ndb-epoch "NDB$EPOCH()").

##### NDB$EPOCH2()

The `NDB$EPOCH2()` function is similar to
`NDB$EPOCH()`, except that
`NDB$EPOCH2()` provides for delete-delete
handling with a bidirectional replication topology. In this
scenario, primary and secondary roles are assigned to the two
sources by setting the
[`ndb_slave_conflict_role`](mysql-cluster-options-variables.md#sysvar_ndb_slave_conflict_role) system
variable to the appropriate value on each source (usually one
each of `PRIMARY`,
`SECONDARY`). When this is done, modifications
made by the secondary are reflected by the primary back to the
secondary which then conditionally applies them.

##### NDB$EPOCH2\_TRANS()

`NDB$EPOCH2_TRANS()` extends the
`NDB$EPOCH2()` function. Conflicts are detected
and handled in the same way, and assigning primary and secondary
roles to the replicating clusters, but with the extra condition
that any other rows updated in the same transaction in which the
conflict occurred are also regarded as being in conflict. That
is, `NDB$EPOCH2()` realigns individual
conflicting rows on the secondary, while
`NDB$EPOCH_TRANS()` realigns conflicting
transactions.

Where `NDB$EPOCH()` and
`NDB$EPOCH_TRANS()` use metadata that is
specified per row, per last modified epoch, to determine on the
primary whether an incoming replicated row change from the
secondary is concurrent with a locally committed change;
concurrent changes are regarded as conflicting, with subsequent
exceptions table updates and realignment of the secondary. A
problem arises when a row is deleted on the primary so there is
no longer any last-modified epoch available to determine whether
any replicated operations conflict, which means that conflicting
delete operations are not detected. This can result in
divergence, an example being a delete on one cluster which is
concurrent with a delete and insert on the other; this why
delete operations can be routed to only one cluster when using
`NDB$EPOCH()` and
`NDB$EPOCH_TRANS()`.

`NDB$EPOCH2()` bypasses the issue just
described—storing information about deleted rows on the
PRIMARY—by ignoring any delete-delete conflict, and by
avoiding any potential resultant divergence as well. This is
accomplished by reflecting any operation successfully applied on
and replicated from the secondary back to the secondary. On its
return to the secondary, it can be used to reapply an operation
on the secondary which was deleted by an operation originating
from the primary.

When using `NDB$EPOCH2()`, you should keep in
mind that the secondary applies the delete from the primary,
removing the new row until it is restored by a reflected
operation. In theory, the subsequent insert or update on the
secondary conflicts with the delete from the primary, but in
this case, we choose to ignore this and allow the secondary to
“win”, in the interest of preventing divergence
between the clusters. In other words, after a delete, the
primary does not detect conflicts, and instead adopts the
secondary's following changes immediately. Because of this,
the secondary's state can revisit multiple previous
committed states as it progresses to a final (stable) state, and
some of these may be visible.

You should also be aware that reflecting all operations from the
secondary back to the primary increases the size of the
primary's logbinary log, as well as demands on bandwidth, CPU
usage, and disk I/O.

Application of reflected operations on the secondary depends on
the state of the target row on the secondary. Whether or not
reflected changes are applied on the secondary can be tracked by
checking the
[`Ndb_conflict_reflected_op_prepare_count`](mysql-cluster-options-variables.md#statvar_Ndb_conflict_reflected_op_prepare_count)
and
[`Ndb_conflict_reflected_op_discard_count`](mysql-cluster-options-variables.md#statvar_Ndb_conflict_reflected_op_discard_count)
status variables. The number of changes applied is simply the
difference between these two values (note that
`Ndb_conflict_reflected_op_prepare_count` is
always greater than or equal to
`Ndb_conflict_reflected_op_discard_count`).

Events are applied if and only if both of the following
conditions are true:

- The existence of the row—that is, whether or not it
  exists—is in accordance with the type of event. For
  delete and update operations, the row must already exist.
  For insert operations, the row must *not*
  exist.
- The row was last modified by the primary. It is possible
  that the modification was accomplished through the execution
  of a reflected operation.

If both of these conditions are not met, the reflected operation
is discarded by the secondary.

#### Conflict Resolution Exceptions Table

To use the `NDB$OLD()` conflict resolution
function, it is also necessary to create an exceptions table
corresponding to each [`NDB`](mysql-cluster.md "Chapter 25 MySQL NDB Cluster 8.0") table for
which this type of conflict resolution is to be employed. This
is also true when using `NDB$EPOCH()` or
`NDB$EPOCH_TRANS()`. The name of this table is
that of the table for which conflict resolution is to be
applied, with the string `$EX` appended. (For
example, if the name of the original table is
`mytable`, the name of the corresponding
exceptions table name should be `mytable$EX`.)
The syntax for creating the exceptions table is as shown here:

```sql
CREATE TABLE original_table$EX  (
    [NDB$]server_id INT UNSIGNED,
    [NDB$]source_server_id INT UNSIGNED,
    [NDB$]source_epoch BIGINT UNSIGNED,
    [NDB$]count INT UNSIGNED,

    [NDB$OP_TYPE ENUM('WRITE_ROW','UPDATE_ROW', 'DELETE_ROW',
      'REFRESH_ROW', 'READ_ROW') NOT NULL,]
    [NDB$CFT_CAUSE ENUM('ROW_DOES_NOT_EXIST', 'ROW_ALREADY_EXISTS',
      'DATA_IN_CONFLICT', 'TRANS_IN_CONFLICT') NOT NULL,]
    [NDB$ORIG_TRANSID BIGINT UNSIGNED NOT NULL,]

    original_table_pk_columns,

    [orig_table_column|orig_table_column$OLD|orig_table_column$NEW,]

    [additional_columns,]

    PRIMARY KEY([NDB$]server_id, [NDB$]source_server_id, [NDB$]source_epoch, [NDB$]count)
) ENGINE=NDB;
```

The first four columns are required. The names of the first four
columns and the columns matching the original table's
primary key columns are not critical; however, we suggest for
reasons of clarity and consistency, that you use the names shown
here for the `server_id`,
`source_server_id`,
`source_epoch`, and `count`
columns, and that you use the same names as in the original
table for the columns matching those in the original
table's primary key.

If the exceptions table uses one or more of the optional columns
`NDB$OP_TYPE`,
`NDB$CFT_CAUSE`, or
`NDB$ORIG_TRANSID` discussed later in this
section, then each of the required columns must also be named
using the prefix `NDB$`. If desired, you can
use the `NDB$` prefix to name the required
columns even if you do not define any optional columns, but in
this case, all four of the required columns must be named using
the prefix.

Following these columns, the columns making up the original
table's primary key should be copied in the order in which
they are used to define the primary key of the original table.
The data types for the columns duplicating the primary key
columns of the original table should be the same as (or larger
than) those of the original columns. A subset of the primary key
columns may be used.

The exceptions table must use the
[`NDB`](mysql-cluster.md "Chapter 25 MySQL NDB Cluster 8.0") storage engine. (An example
that uses `NDB$OLD()` with an exceptions table
is shown later in this section.)

Additional columns may optionally be defined following the
copied primary key columns, but not before any of them; any such
extra columns cannot be `NOT NULL`. NDB Cluster
supports three additional, predefined optional columns
`NDB$OP_TYPE`,
`NDB$CFT_CAUSE`, and
`NDB$ORIG_TRANSID`, which are described in the
next few paragraphs.

`NDB$OP_TYPE`: This column can be used to
obtain the type of operation causing the conflict. If you use
this column, define it as shown here:

```sql
NDB$OP_TYPE ENUM('WRITE_ROW', 'UPDATE_ROW', 'DELETE_ROW',
    'REFRESH_ROW', 'READ_ROW') NOT NULL
```

The `WRITE_ROW`, `UPDATE_ROW`,
and `DELETE_ROW` operation types represent
user-initiated operations. `REFRESH_ROW`
operations are operations generated by conflict resolution in
compensating transactions sent back to the originating cluster
from the cluster that detected the conflict.
`READ_ROW` operations are user-initiated read
tracking operations defined with exclusive row locks.

`NDB$CFT_CAUSE`: You can define an optional
column `NDB$CFT_CAUSE` which provides the cause
of the registered conflict. This column, if used, is defined as
shown here:

```sql
NDB$CFT_CAUSE ENUM('ROW_DOES_NOT_EXIST', 'ROW_ALREADY_EXISTS',
    'DATA_IN_CONFLICT', 'TRANS_IN_CONFLICT') NOT NULL
```

`ROW_DOES_NOT_EXIST` can be reported as the
cause for `UPDATE_ROW` and
`WRITE_ROW` operations;
`ROW_ALREADY_EXISTS` can be reported for
`WRITE_ROW` events.
`DATA_IN_CONFLICT` is reported when a row-based
conflict function detects a conflict;
`TRANS_IN_CONFLICT` is reported when a
transactional conflict function rejects all of the operations
belonging to a complete transaction.

`NDB$ORIG_TRANSID`: The
`NDB$ORIG_TRANSID` column, if used, contains
the ID of the originating transaction. This column should be
defined as follows:

```sql
NDB$ORIG_TRANSID BIGINT UNSIGNED NOT NULL
```

`NDB$ORIG_TRANSID` is a 64-bit value generated
by `NDB`. This value can be used to correlate
multiple exceptions table entries belonging to the same
conflicting transaction from the same or different exceptions
tables.

Additional reference columns which are not part of the original
table's primary key can be named
`colname$OLD` or
`colname$NEW`.
`colname$OLD`
references old values in update and delete operations—that
is, operations containing `DELETE_ROW` events.
`colname$NEW` can be
used to reference new values in insert and update
operations—in other words, operations using
`WRITE_ROW` events,
`UPDATE_ROW` events, or both types of events.
Where a conflicting operation does not supply a value for a
given reference column that is not a primary key, the exceptions
table row contains either `NULL`, or a defined
default value for that column.

Important

The `mysql.ndb_replication` table is read
when a data table is set up for replication, so the row
corresponding to a table to be replicated must be inserted
into `mysql.ndb_replication`
*before* the table to be replicated is
created.

#### Conflict Detection Status Variables

Several status variables can be used to monitor conflict
detection. You can see how many rows have been found in conflict
by `NDB$EPOCH()` since this replica was last
restarted from the current value of the
[`Ndb_conflict_fn_epoch`](mysql-cluster-options-variables.md#statvar_Ndb_conflict_fn_epoch) system
status variable.

[`Ndb_conflict_fn_epoch_trans`](mysql-cluster-options-variables.md#statvar_Ndb_conflict_fn_epoch_trans)
provides the number of rows that have been found directly in
conflict by `NDB$EPOCH_TRANS()`.
[`Ndb_conflict_fn_epoch2`](mysql-cluster-options-variables.md#statvar_Ndb_conflict_fn_epoch2) and
[`Ndb_conflict_fn_epoch2_trans`](mysql-cluster-options-variables.md#statvar_Ndb_conflict_fn_epoch2_trans)
show the number of rows found in conflict by
`NDB$EPOCH2()` and
`NDB$EPOCH2_TRANS()`, respectively. The number
of rows actually realigned, including those affected due to
their membership in or dependency on the same transactions as
other conflicting rows, is given by
[`Ndb_conflict_trans_row_reject_count`](mysql-cluster-options-variables.md#statvar_Ndb_conflict_trans_row_reject_count).

Another server status variable
[`Ndb_conflict_fn_max`](mysql-cluster-options-variables.md#statvar_Ndb_conflict_fn_max) provides a
count of the number of times that a row was not applied on the
current SQL node due to “greatest timestamp wins”
conflict resolution since the last time that
[**mysqld**](mysqld.md "6.3.1 mysqld — The MySQL Server") was started.
[`Ndb_conflict_fn_max_del_win`](mysql-cluster-options-variables.md#statvar_Ndb_conflict_fn_max_del_win)
provides a count of the number of times that conflict resolution
based on the outcome of `NDB$MAX_DELETE_WIN()`
has been applied.

NDB 8.0.30 and later provides
[`Ndb_conflict_fn_max_ins`](mysql-cluster-options-variables.md#statvar_Ndb_conflict_fn_max_ins) for
tracking the number of times that “greater timestamp
wins” handling has been applied to write operations
(using `NDB$MAX_INS()`); a count of the number
of times that “same timestamp wins” handling of
writes has been applied (as implemented by
`NDB$MAX_DEL_WIN_INS()`), is provided by the
status variable
[`Ndb_conflict_fn_max_del_win_ins`](mysql-cluster-options-variables.md#statvar_Ndb_conflict_fn_max_del_win_ins).

The number of times that a row was not applied as the result of
“same timestamp wins” conflict resolution on a
given [**mysqld**](mysqld.md "6.3.1 mysqld — The MySQL Server") since the last time it was
restarted is given by the global status variable
[`Ndb_conflict_fn_old`](mysql-cluster-options-variables.md#statvar_Ndb_conflict_fn_old). In
addition to incrementing
[`Ndb_conflict_fn_old`](mysql-cluster-options-variables.md#statvar_Ndb_conflict_fn_old), the
primary key of the row that was not used is inserted into an
exceptions table, as
explained elsewhere in this section.

See also [Section 25.4.3.9.3, “NDB Cluster Status Variables”](mysql-cluster-options-variables.md#mysql-cluster-status-variables "25.4.3.9.3 NDB Cluster Status Variables").

#### Examples

The following examples assume that you have already a working
NDB Cluster replication setup, as described in
[Section 25.7.5, “Preparing the NDB Cluster for Replication”](mysql-cluster-replication-preparation.md "25.7.5 Preparing the NDB Cluster for Replication"), and
[Section 25.7.6, “Starting NDB Cluster Replication (Single Replication Channel)”](mysql-cluster-replication-starting.md "25.7.6 Starting NDB Cluster Replication (Single Replication Channel)").

**NDB$MAX() example.**
Suppose you wish to enable “greatest timestamp
wins” conflict resolution on table
`test.t1`, using column
`mycol` as the “timestamp”. This
can be done using the following steps:

1. Make sure that you have started the source
   [**mysqld**](mysqld.md "6.3.1 mysqld — The MySQL Server") with
   [`--ndb-log-update-as-write=OFF`](mysql-cluster-options-variables.md#option_mysqld_ndb-log-update-as-write).
2. On the source, perform this
   [`INSERT`](insert.md "15.2.7 INSERT Statement") statement:

   ```sql
   INSERT INTO mysql.ndb_replication
       VALUES ('test', 't1', 0, NULL, 'NDB$MAX(mycol)');
   ```

   Note

   If the `ndb_replication` table does not
   already exist, you must create it. See
   [ndb\_replication Table](mysql-cluster-replication-schema.md#ndb-replication-ndb-replication "ndb_replication Table").

   Inserting a 0 into the `server_id` column
   indicates that all SQL nodes accessing this table should use
   conflict resolution. If you want to use conflict resolution
   on a specific [**mysqld**](mysqld.md "6.3.1 mysqld — The MySQL Server") only, use the actual
   server ID.

   Inserting `NULL` into the
   `binlog_type` column has the same effect as
   inserting 0 (`NBT_DEFAULT`); the server
   default is used.
3. Create the `test.t1` table:

   ```sql
   CREATE TABLE test.t1 (
       columns
       mycol INT UNSIGNED,
       columns
   ) ENGINE=NDB;
   ```

   Now, when updates are performed on this table, conflict
   resolution is applied, and the version of the row having the
   greatest value for `mycol` is written to
   the replica.

Note

Other `binlog_type` options such as
`NBT_UPDATED_ONLY_USE_UPDATE`
(`6`) should be used to control logging on
the source using the `ndb_replication` table
rather than by using command-line options.

**NDB$OLD() example.**
Suppose an [`NDB`](mysql-cluster.md "Chapter 25 MySQL NDB Cluster 8.0") table such as the
one defined here is being replicated, and you wish to enable
“same timestamp wins” conflict resolution for
updates to this table:

```sql
CREATE TABLE test.t2  (
    a INT UNSIGNED NOT NULL,
    b CHAR(25) NOT NULL,
    columns,
    mycol INT UNSIGNED NOT NULL,
    columns,
    PRIMARY KEY pk (a, b)
)   ENGINE=NDB;
```

The following steps are required, in the order shown:

1. First—and *prior* to creating
   `test.t2`—you must insert a row into
   the
   [`mysql.ndb_replication`](mysql-cluster-replication-schema.md#ndb-replication-ndb-replication "ndb_replication Table")
   table, as shown here:

   ```sql
   INSERT INTO mysql.ndb_replication
       VALUES ('test', 't2', 0, 0, 'NDB$OLD(mycol)');
   ```

   Possible values for the `binlog_type`
   column are shown earlier in this section; in this case, we
   use `0` to specify that the server default
   logging behavior be used. The value
   `'NDB$OLD(mycol)'` should be inserted into
   the `conflict_fn` column.
2. Create an appropriate exceptions table for
   `test.t2`. The table creation statement
   shown here includes all required columns; any additional
   columns must be declared following these columns, and before
   the definition of the table's primary key.

   ```sql
   CREATE TABLE test.t2$EX  (
       server_id INT UNSIGNED,
       source_server_id INT UNSIGNED,
       source_epoch BIGINT UNSIGNED,
       count INT UNSIGNED,
       a INT UNSIGNED NOT NULL,
       b CHAR(25) NOT NULL,

       [additional_columns,]

       PRIMARY KEY(server_id, source_server_id, source_epoch, count)
   )   ENGINE=NDB;
   ```

   We can include additional columns for information about the
   type, cause, and originating transaction ID for a given
   conflict. We are also not required to supply matching
   columns for all primary key columns in the original table.
   This means you can create the exceptions table like this:

   ```sql
   CREATE TABLE test.t2$EX  (
       NDB$server_id INT UNSIGNED,
       NDB$source_server_id INT UNSIGNED,
       NDB$source_epoch BIGINT UNSIGNED,
       NDB$count INT UNSIGNED,
       a INT UNSIGNED NOT NULL,

       NDB$OP_TYPE ENUM('WRITE_ROW','UPDATE_ROW', 'DELETE_ROW',
         'REFRESH_ROW', 'READ_ROW') NOT NULL,
       NDB$CFT_CAUSE ENUM('ROW_DOES_NOT_EXIST', 'ROW_ALREADY_EXISTS',
         'DATA_IN_CONFLICT', 'TRANS_IN_CONFLICT') NOT NULL,
       NDB$ORIG_TRANSID BIGINT UNSIGNED NOT NULL,

       [additional_columns,]

       PRIMARY KEY(NDB$server_id, NDB$source_server_id, NDB$source_epoch, NDB$count)
   )   ENGINE=NDB;
   ```

   Note

   The `NDB$` prefix is required for the
   four required columns since we included at least one of
   the columns `NDB$OP_TYPE`,
   `NDB$CFT_CAUSE`, or
   `NDB$ORIG_TRANSID` in the table
   definition.
3. Create the table `test.t2` as shown
   previously.

These steps must be followed for every table for which you wish
to perform conflict resolution using
`NDB$OLD()`. For each such table, there must be
a corresponding row in `mysql.ndb_replication`,
and there must be an exceptions table in the same database as
the table being replicated.

**Read conflict detection and resolution.**

NDB Cluster also supports tracking of read operations, which
makes it possible in circular replication setups to manage
conflicts between reads of a given row in one cluster and
updates or deletes of the same row in another. This example
uses `employee` and
`department` tables to model a scenario in
which an employee is moved from one department to another on
the source cluster (which we refer to hereafter as cluster
*A*) while the replica cluster (hereafter
*B*) updates the employee count of the
employee's former department in an interleaved
transaction.

The data tables have been created using the following SQL
statements:

```sql
# Employee table
CREATE TABLE employee (
    id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    name VARCHAR(2000),
    dept INT NOT NULL
)   ENGINE=NDB;

# Department table
CREATE TABLE department (
    id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    name VARCHAR(2000),
    members INT
)   ENGINE=NDB;
```

The contents of the two tables include the rows shown in the
(partial) output of the following
[`SELECT`](select.md "15.2.13 SELECT Statement") statements:

```sql
mysql> SELECT id, name, dept FROM employee;
+---------------+------+
| id   | name   | dept |
+------+--------+------+
...
| 998  |  Mike  | 3    |
| 999  |  Joe   | 3    |
| 1000 |  Mary  | 3    |
...
+------+--------+------+

mysql> SELECT id, name, members FROM department;
+-----+-------------+---------+
| id  | name        | members |
+-----+-------------+---------+
...
| 3   | Old project | 24      |
...
+-----+-------------+---------+
```

We assume that we are already using an exceptions table that
includes the four required columns (and these are used for this
table's primary key), the optional columns for operation
type and cause, and the original table's primary key
column, created using the SQL statement shown here:

```sql
CREATE TABLE employee$EX  (
    NDB$server_id INT UNSIGNED,
    NDB$source_server_id INT UNSIGNED,
    NDB$source_epoch BIGINT UNSIGNED,
    NDB$count INT UNSIGNED,

    NDB$OP_TYPE ENUM( 'WRITE_ROW','UPDATE_ROW', 'DELETE_ROW',
                      'REFRESH_ROW','READ_ROW') NOT NULL,
    NDB$CFT_CAUSE ENUM( 'ROW_DOES_NOT_EXIST',
                        'ROW_ALREADY_EXISTS',
                        'DATA_IN_CONFLICT',
                        'TRANS_IN_CONFLICT') NOT NULL,

    id INT NOT NULL,

    PRIMARY KEY(NDB$server_id, NDB$source_server_id, NDB$source_epoch, NDB$count)
)   ENGINE=NDB;
```

Suppose there occur the two simultaneous transactions on the two
clusters. On cluster *A*, we create a new
department, then move employee number 999 into that department,
using the following SQL statements:

```sql
BEGIN;
  INSERT INTO department VALUES (4, "New project", 1);
  UPDATE employee SET dept = 4 WHERE id = 999;
COMMIT;
```

At the same time, on cluster *B*, another
transaction reads from `employee`, as shown
here:

```sql
BEGIN;
  SELECT name FROM employee WHERE id = 999;
  UPDATE department SET members = members - 1  WHERE id = 3;
commit;
```

The conflicting transactions are not normally detected by the
conflict resolution mechanism, since the conflict is between a
read (`SELECT`) and an update operation. You
can circumvent this issue by executing
[`SET`](set-variable.md "15.7.6.1 SET Syntax for Variable Assignment")
[`ndb_log_exclusive_reads`](mysql-cluster-options-variables.md#sysvar_ndb_log_exclusive_reads)
`= 1` on the replica cluster. Acquiring
exclusive read locks in this way causes any rows read on the
source to be flagged as needing conflict resolution on the
replica cluster. If we enable exclusive reads in this way prior
to the logging of these transactions, the read on cluster
*B* is tracked and sent to cluster
*A* for resolution; the conflict on the
employee row is subsequently detected and the transaction on
cluster *B* is aborted.

The conflict is registered in the exceptions table (on cluster
*A*) as a `READ_ROW`
operation (see
[Conflict Resolution Exceptions Table](mysql-cluster-replication-conflict-resolution.md#conflict-resolution-exceptions-table "Conflict Resolution Exceptions Table"), for a
description of operation types), as shown here:

```sql
mysql> SELECT id, NDB$OP_TYPE, NDB$CFT_CAUSE FROM employee$EX;
+-------+-------------+-------------------+
| id    | NDB$OP_TYPE | NDB$CFT_CAUSE     |
+-------+-------------+-------------------+
...
| 999   | READ_ROW    | TRANS_IN_CONFLICT |
+-------+-------------+-------------------+
```

Any existing rows found in the read operation are flagged. This
means that multiple rows resulting from the same conflict may be
logged in the exception table, as shown by examining the effects
a conflict between an update on cluster *A*
and a read of multiple rows on cluster *B*
from the same table in simultaneous transactions. The
transaction executed on cluster *A* is shown
here:

```sql
BEGIN;
  INSERT INTO department VALUES (4, "New project", 0);
  UPDATE employee SET dept = 4 WHERE dept = 3;
  SELECT COUNT(*) INTO @count FROM employee WHERE dept = 4;
  UPDATE department SET members = @count WHERE id = 4;
COMMIT;
```

Concurrently a transaction containing the statements shown here
runs on cluster *B*:

```sql
SET ndb_log_exclusive_reads = 1;  # Must be set if not already enabled
...
BEGIN;
  SELECT COUNT(*) INTO @count FROM employee WHERE dept = 3 FOR UPDATE;
  UPDATE department SET members = @count WHERE id = 3;
COMMIT;
```

In this case, all three rows matching the
`WHERE` condition in the second
transaction's `SELECT` are read, and are
thus flagged in the exceptions table, as shown here:

```sql
mysql> SELECT id, NDB$OP_TYPE, NDB$CFT_CAUSE FROM employee$EX;
+-------+-------------+-------------------+
| id    | NDB$OP_TYPE | NDB$CFT_CAUSE     |
+-------+-------------+-------------------+
...
| 998   | READ_ROW    | TRANS_IN_CONFLICT |
| 999   | READ_ROW    | TRANS_IN_CONFLICT |
| 1000  | READ_ROW    | TRANS_IN_CONFLICT |
...
+-------+-------------+-------------------+
```

Read tracking is performed on the basis of existing rows only. A
read based on a given condition track conflicts only of any rows
that are *found* and not of any rows that are
inserted in an interleaved transaction. This is similar to how
exclusive row locking is performed in a single instance of NDB
Cluster.

**Insert conflict detection and resolution example (NDB 8.0.30 and later).**
The following example illustrates the use of the insert
conflict detection functions added in NDB 8.0.30. We assume
that we are replicating two tables `t1` and
`t2` in database `test`, and
that we wish to use insert conflict detection with
`NDB$MAX_INS()` for `t1` and
`NDB$MAX_DEL_WIN_INS()` for
`t2`. The two data tables are not created
until later in the setup process.

Setting up insert conflict resolution is similar to setting up
other conflict detection and resolution algorithms as shown in
the previous examples. If the
`mysql.ndb_replication` table used to configure
binary logging and conflict resolution, does not already exist,
it is first necessary to create it, as shown here:

```sql
CREATE TABLE mysql.ndb_replication (
    db VARBINARY(63),
    table_name VARBINARY(63),
    server_id INT UNSIGNED,
    binlog_type INT UNSIGNED,
    conflict_fn VARBINARY(128),
    PRIMARY KEY USING HASH (db, table_name, server_id)
) ENGINE=NDB
PARTITION BY KEY(db,table_name);
```

The `ndb_replication` table acts on a per-table
basis; that is, we need to insert a row containing table
information, a `binlog_type` value, the
conflict resolution function to be employed, and the name of the
timestamp column (`X`) for each table to be set
up, like this:

```sql
INSERT INTO mysql.ndb_replication VALUES ("test", "t1", 0, 7, "NDB$MAX_INS(X)");
INSERT INTO mysql.ndb_replication VALUES ("test", "t2", 0, 7, "NDB$MAX_DEL_WIN_INS(X)");
```

Here we have set the binlog\_type as
`NBT_FULL_USE_UPDATE` (`7`)
which means that full rows are always logged. See
[ndb\_replication Table](mysql-cluster-replication-schema.md#ndb-replication-ndb-replication "ndb_replication Table"), for other
possible values.

You can also create an exceptions table corresponding to each
`NDB` table for which conflict resolution is to
be employed. An exceptions table records all rows rejected by
the conflict resolution function for a given table. Exceptions
tables for replication conflict detection for tables
`t1` and `t2` can be created
using the following two SQL statements:

```sql
CREATE TABLE `t1$EX` (
    NDB$server_id INT UNSIGNED,
    NDB$master_server_id INT UNSIGNED,
    NDB$master_epoch BIGINT UNSIGNED,
    NDB$count INT UNSIGNED,
    NDB$OP_TYPE ENUM('WRITE_ROW', 'UPDATE_ROW', 'DELETE_ROW',
                     'REFRESH_ROW', 'READ_ROW') NOT NULL,
    NDB$CFT_CAUSE ENUM('ROW_DOES_NOT_EXIST', 'ROW_ALREADY_EXISTS',
                       'DATA_IN_CONFLICT', 'TRANS_IN_CONFLICT') NOT NULL,
    a INT NOT NULL,
    PRIMARY KEY(NDB$server_id, NDB$master_server_id,
                NDB$master_epoch, NDB$count)
) ENGINE=NDB;

CREATE TABLE `t2$EX` (
    NDB$server_id INT UNSIGNED,
    NDB$master_server_id INT UNSIGNED,
    NDB$master_epoch BIGINT UNSIGNED,
    NDB$count INT UNSIGNED,
    NDB$OP_TYPE ENUM('WRITE_ROW', 'UPDATE_ROW', 'DELETE_ROW',
                     'REFRESH_ROW', 'READ_ROW') NOT NULL,
    NDB$CFT_CAUSE ENUM( 'ROW_DOES_NOT_EXIST', 'ROW_ALREADY_EXISTS',
                        'DATA_IN_CONFLICT', 'TRANS_IN_CONFLICT') NOT NULL,
    a INT NOT NULL,
    PRIMARY KEY(NDB$server_id, NDB$master_server_id,
                NDB$master_epoch, NDB$count)
) ENGINE=NDB;
```

Finally, after creating the exception tables just shown, you can
create the data tables to be replicated and subject to conflict
resolution control, using the following two SQL statements:

```sql
CREATE TABLE t1 (
    a INT PRIMARY KEY,
    b VARCHAR(32),
    X INT UNSIGNED
) ENGINE=NDB;

CREATE TABLE t2 (
    a INT PRIMARY KEY,
    b VARCHAR(32),
    X INT UNSIGNED
) ENGINE=NDB;
```

For each table, the `X` column is used as the
timestamp column.

Once created on the source, `t1` and
`t2` are replicated and can be assumed to exist
on both the source and the replica. In the remainder of this
example, we use `mysqlS>` to indicate a
[**mysql**](mysql.md "6.5.1 mysql — The MySQL Command-Line Client") client connected to the source, and
`mysqlR>` to indicate a
[**mysql**](mysql.md "6.5.1 mysql — The MySQL Command-Line Client") client running on the replica.

First we insert one row each into the tables on the source, like
this:

```sql
mysqlS> INSERT INTO t1 VALUES (1, 'Initial X=1', 1);
Query OK, 1 row affected (0.01 sec)

mysqlS> INSERT INTO t2 VALUES (1, 'Initial X=1', 1);
Query OK, 1 row affected (0.01 sec)
```

We can be certain that these two rows are replicated without
causing any conflicts, since the tables on the replica did not
contain any rows prior to issuing the
[`INSERT`](insert.md "15.2.7 INSERT Statement") statements on the source.
We can verify this by selecting from the tables on the replica
as shown here:

```sql
mysqlR> TABLE t1 ORDER BY a;
+---+-------------+------+
| a | b           | X    |
+---+-------------+------+
| 1 | Initial X=1 |    1 |
+---+-------------+------+
1 row in set (0.00 sec)

mysqlR> TABLE t2 ORDER BY a;
+---+-------------+------+
| a | b           | X    |
+---+-------------+------+
| 1 | Initial X=1 |    1 |
+---+-------------+------+
1 row in set (0.00 sec)
```

Next, we insert new rows into the tables on the replica, like
this:

```sql
mysqlR> INSERT INTO t1 VALUES (2, 'Replica X=2', 2);
Query OK, 1 row affected (0.01 sec)

mysqlR> INSERT INTO t2 VALUES (2, 'Replica X=2', 2);
Query OK, 1 row affected (0.01 sec)
```

Now we insert conflicting rows into the tables on the source
having greater timestamp (`X`) column values,
using the statements shown here:

```sql
mysqlS> INSERT INTO t1 VALUES (2, 'Source X=20', 20);
Query OK, 1 row affected (0.01 sec)

mysqlS> INSERT INTO t2 VALUES (2, 'Source X=20', 20);
Query OK, 1 row affected (0.01 sec)
```

Now we observe the results by selecting (again) from both tables
on the replica, as shown here:

```sql
mysqlR> TABLE t1 ORDER BY a;
+---+-------------+-------+
| a | b           | X     |
+---+-------------+-------+
| 1 | Initial X=1 |    1  |
+---+-------------+-------+
| 2 | Source X=20 |   20  |
+---+-------------+-------+
2 rows in set (0.00 sec)

mysqlR> TABLE t2 ORDER BY a;
+---+-------------+-------+
| a | b           | X     |
+---+-------------+-------+
| 1 | Initial X=1 |    1  |
+---+-------------+-------+
| 1 | Source X=20 |   20  |
+---+-------------+-------+
2 rows in set (0.00 sec)
```

The rows inserted on the source, having greater timestamps than
those in the conflicting rows on the replica, have replaced
those rows. On the replica, we next insert two new rows which do
not conflict with any existing rows in `t1` or
`t2`, like this:

```simple
mysqlR> INSERT INTO t1 VALUES (3, 'Slave X=30', 30);
Query OK, 1 row affected (0.01 sec)

mysqlR> INSERT INTO t2 VALUES (3, 'Slave X=30', 30);
Query OK, 1 row affected (0.01 sec)
```

Inserting more rows on the source with the same primary key
value (`3`) brings about conflicts as before,
but this time we use a value for the timestamp column less than
that in same column in the conflicting rows on the replica.

```sql
mysqlS> INSERT INTO t1 VALUES (3, 'Source X=3', 3);
Query OK, 1 row affected (0.01 sec)

mysqlS> INSERT INTO t2 VALUES (3, 'Source X=3', 3);
Query OK, 1 row affected (0.01 sec)
```

We can see by querying the tables that both inserts from the
source were rejected by the replica, and the rows inserted on
the replica previously have not been overwritten, as shown here
in the [**mysql**](mysql.md "6.5.1 mysql — The MySQL Command-Line Client") client on the replica:

```sql
mysqlR> TABLE t1 ORDER BY a;
+---+--------------+-------+
| a | b            | X     |
+---+--------------+-------+
| 1 |  Initial X=1 |    1  |
+---+--------------+-------+
| 2 |  Source X=20 |   20  |
+---+--------------+-------+
| 3 | Replica X=30 |   30  |
+---+--------------+-------+
3 rows in set (0.00 sec)

mysqlR> TABLE t2 ORDER BY a;
+---+--------------+-------+
| a | b            | X     |
+---+--------------+-------+
| 1 |  Initial X=1 |    1  |
+---+--------------+-------+
| 2 |  Source X=20 |   20  |
+---+--------------+-------+
| 3 | Replica X=30 |   30  |
+---+--------------+-------+
3 rows in set (0.00 sec)
```

You can see information about the rows that were rejected in the
exception tables, as shown here:

```sql
mysqlR> SELECT  NDB$server_id, NDB$master_server_id, NDB$count,
      >         NDB$OP_TYPE, NDB$CFT_CAUSE, a
      > FROM t1$EX
      > ORDER BY NDB$count\G
*************************** 1. row ***************************
NDB$server_id       : 2
NDB$master_server_id: 1
NDB$count           : 1
NDB$OP_TYPE         : WRITE_ROW
NDB$CFT_CAUSE       : DATA_IN_CONFLICT
a                   : 3
1 row in set (0.00 sec)

mysqlR> SELECT  NDB$server_id, NDB$master_server_id, NDB$count,
      >         NDB$OP_TYPE, NDB$CFT_CAUSE, a
      > FROM t2$EX
      > ORDER BY NDB$count\G
*************************** 1. row ***************************
NDB$server_id       : 2
NDB$master_server_id: 1
NDB$count           : 1
NDB$OP_TYPE         : WRITE_ROW
NDB$CFT_CAUSE       : DATA_IN_CONFLICT
a                   : 3
1 row in set (0.00 sec)
```

As we saw earlier, no other rows inserted on the source were
rejected by the replica, only those rows having a lesser
timestamp value than the rows in conflict on the replica.
