### 22.3.2 Download and Import world\_x Database

As part of this quick-start guide, an example schema is provided
which is referred to as the `world_x` schema.
Many of the examples demonstrate Document Store functionality
using this schema. Start your MySQL server so that you can load
the `world_x` schema, then follow these steps:

1. Download
   [world\_x-db.zip](http://downloads.mysql.com/docs/world_x-db.zip).
2. Extract the installation archive to a temporary location such
   as `/tmp/`. Unpacking the archive results
   in a single file named `world_x.sql`.
3. Import the `world_x.sql` file to your
   server. You can either:

   - Start MySQL Shell in SQL mode and import the file by
     issuing:

     ```terminal
     mysqlsh -u root --sql --file /tmp/world_x-db/world_x.sql
     Enter password: ****
     ```
   - Set MySQL Shell to SQL mode while it is running and
     source the schema file by issuing:

     ```mysqlsh
     \sql
     Switching to SQL mode... Commands end with ;
     \source /tmp/world_x-db/world_x.sql
     ```

   Replace `/tmp/` with the path to the
   `world_x.sql` file on your system. Enter
   your password if prompted. A non-root account can be used as
   long as the account has privileges to create new schemas.

#### The world\_x Schema

The `world_x` example schema contains the
following JSON collection and relational tables:

- Collection

  - `countryinfo`: Information about
    countries in the world.
- Tables

  - `country`: Minimal information about
    countries of the world.
  - `city`: Information about some of the
    cities in those countries.
  - `countrylanguage`: Languages spoken in
    each country.
