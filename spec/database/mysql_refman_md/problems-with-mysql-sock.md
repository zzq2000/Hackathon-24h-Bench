#### B.3.3.6 How to Protect or Change the MySQL Unix Socket File

The default location for the Unix socket file that the server
uses for communication with local clients is
`/tmp/mysql.sock`. (For some distribution
formats, the directory might be different, such as
`/var/lib/mysql` for RPMs.)

On some versions of Unix, anyone can delete files in the
`/tmp` directory or other similar
directories used for temporary files. If the socket file is
located in such a directory on your system, this might cause
problems.

On most versions of Unix, you can protect your
`/tmp` directory so that files can be
deleted only by their owners or the superuser
(`root`). To do this, set the
`sticky` bit on the `/tmp`
directory by logging in as `root` and using
the following command:

```terminal
$> chmod +t /tmp
```

You can check whether the `sticky` bit is set
by executing `ls -ld /tmp`. If the last
permission character is `t`, the bit is set.

Another approach is to change the place where the server
creates the Unix socket file. If you do this, you should also
let client programs know the new location of the file. You can
specify the file location in several ways:

- Specify the path in a global or local option file. For
  example, put the following lines in
  `/etc/my.cnf`:

  ```ini
  [mysqld]
  socket=/path/to/socket

  [client]
  socket=/path/to/socket
  ```

  See [Section 6.2.2.2, “Using Option Files”](option-files.md "6.2.2.2 Using Option Files").
- Specify a [`--socket`](connection-options.md#option_general_socket) option
  on the command line to [**mysqld\_safe**](mysqld-safe.md "6.3.2 mysqld_safe — MySQL Server Startup Script") and
  when you run client programs.
- Set the `MYSQL_UNIX_PORT` environment
  variable to the path of the Unix socket file.
- Recompile MySQL from source to use a different default
  Unix socket file location. Define the path to the file
  with the [`MYSQL_UNIX_ADDR`](source-configuration-options.md#option_cmake_mysql_unix_addr)
  option when you run **CMake**. See
  [Section 2.8.7, “MySQL Source-Configuration Options”](source-configuration-options.md "2.8.7 MySQL Source-Configuration Options").

You can test whether the new socket location works by
attempting to connect to the server with this command:

```terminal
$> mysqladmin --socket=/path/to/socket version
```
