#### 7.6.3.1 Thread Pool Elements

MySQL Enterprise Thread Pool comprises these elements:

- A plugin library file implements a plugin for the thread
  pool code as well as several associated monitoring tables
  that provide information about thread pool operation:

  - As of MySQL 8.0.14, the monitoring tables are
    Performance Schema tables; see
    [Section 29.12.16, “Performance Schema Thread Pool Tables”](performance-schema-thread-pool-tables.md "29.12.16 Performance Schema Thread Pool Tables").
  - Prior to MySQL 8.0.14, the monitoring tables are
    `INFORMATION_SCHEMA` tables; see
    [Section 28.5, “INFORMATION\_SCHEMA Thread Pool Tables”](thread-pool-information-schema-tables.md "28.5 INFORMATION_SCHEMA Thread Pool Tables").

    The `INFORMATION_SCHEMA` tables now are
    deprecated; expect them to be removed in a future
    version of MySQL. Applications should transition away
    from the `INFORMATION_SCHEMA` tables to
    the Performance Schema tables. For example, if an
    application uses this query:

    ```sql
    SELECT * FROM INFORMATION_SCHEMA.TP_THREAD_STATE;
    ```

    The application should use this query instead:

    ```sql
    SELECT * FROM performance_schema.tp_thread_state;
    ```

  Note

  If you do not load all the monitoring tables, some or all
  MySQL Enterprise Monitor thread pool graphs may be empty.

  For a detailed description of how the thread pool works, see
  [Section 7.6.3.3, “Thread Pool Operation”](thread-pool-operation.md "7.6.3.3 Thread Pool Operation").
- Several system variables are related to the thread pool. The
  [`thread_handling`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_thread_handling) system
  variable has a value of
  `loaded-dynamically` when the server
  successfully loads the thread pool plugin.

  The other related system variables are implemented by the
  thread pool plugin and are not available unless it is
  enabled. For information about using these variables, see
  [Section 7.6.3.3, “Thread Pool Operation”](thread-pool-operation.md "7.6.3.3 Thread Pool Operation"), and
  [Section 7.6.3.4, “Thread Pool Tuning”](thread-pool-tuning.md "7.6.3.4 Thread Pool Tuning").
- The Performance Schema has instruments that expose
  information about the thread pool and may be used to
  investigate operational performance. To identify them, use
  this query:

  ```sql
  SELECT * FROM performance_schema.setup_instruments
  WHERE NAME LIKE '%thread_pool%';
  ```

  [Chapter 29, *MySQL Performance Schema*](performance-schema.md "Chapter 29 MySQL Performance Schema").
