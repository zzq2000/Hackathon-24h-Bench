## 27.1 Defining Stored Programs

Each stored program contains a body that consists of an SQL
statement. This statement may be a compound statement made up of
several statements separated by semicolon (`;`)
characters. For example, the following stored procedure has a body
made up of a [`BEGIN ...
END`](begin-end.md "15.6.1 BEGIN ... END Compound Statement") block that contains a
[`SET`](set-variable.md "15.7.6.1 SET Syntax for Variable Assignment")
statement and a [`REPEAT`](repeat.md "15.6.5.6 REPEAT Statement") loop that
itself contains another
[`SET`](set-variable.md "15.7.6.1 SET Syntax for Variable Assignment")
statement:

```sql
CREATE PROCEDURE dorepeat(p1 INT)
BEGIN
  SET @x = 0;
  REPEAT SET @x = @x + 1; UNTIL @x > p1 END REPEAT;
END;
```

If you use the [**mysql**](mysql.md "6.5.1 mysql — The MySQL Command-Line Client") client program to define a
stored program containing semicolon characters, a problem arises.
By default, [**mysql**](mysql.md "6.5.1 mysql — The MySQL Command-Line Client") itself recognizes the
semicolon as a statement delimiter, so you must redefine the
delimiter temporarily to cause [**mysql**](mysql.md "6.5.1 mysql — The MySQL Command-Line Client") to pass
the entire stored program definition to the server.

To redefine the [**mysql**](mysql.md "6.5.1 mysql — The MySQL Command-Line Client") delimiter, use the
`delimiter` command. The following example shows
how to do this for the `dorepeat()` procedure
just shown. The delimiter is changed to `//` to
enable the entire definition to be passed to the server as a
single statement, and then restored to `;` before
invoking the procedure. This enables the `;`
delimiter used in the procedure body to be passed through to the
server rather than being interpreted by [**mysql**](mysql.md "6.5.1 mysql — The MySQL Command-Line Client")
itself.

```sql
mysql> delimiter //

mysql> CREATE PROCEDURE dorepeat(p1 INT)
    -> BEGIN
    ->   SET @x = 0;
    ->   REPEAT SET @x = @x + 1; UNTIL @x > p1 END REPEAT;
    -> END
    -> //
Query OK, 0 rows affected (0.00 sec)

mysql> delimiter ;

mysql> CALL dorepeat(1000);
Query OK, 0 rows affected (0.00 sec)

mysql> SELECT @x;
+------+
| @x   |
+------+
| 1001 |
+------+
1 row in set (0.00 sec)
```

You can redefine the delimiter to a string other than
`//`, and the delimiter can consist of a single
character or multiple characters. You should avoid the use of the
backslash (`\`) character because that is the
escape character for MySQL.

The following is an example of a function that takes a parameter,
performs an operation using an SQL function, and returns the
result. In this case, it is unnecessary to use
`delimiter` because the function definition
contains no internal `;` statement delimiters:

```sql
mysql> CREATE FUNCTION hello (s CHAR(20))
mysql> RETURNS CHAR(50) DETERMINISTIC
    -> RETURN CONCAT('Hello, ',s,'!');
Query OK, 0 rows affected (0.00 sec)

mysql> SELECT hello('world');
+----------------+
| hello('world') |
+----------------+
| Hello, world!  |
+----------------+
1 row in set (0.00 sec)
```
