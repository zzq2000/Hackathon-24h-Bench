## 17.2 InnoDB and the ACID Model

The [ACID](glossary.md#glos_acid "ACID") model is a set of database
design principles that emphasize aspects of reliability that are
important for business data and mission-critical applications. MySQL
includes components such as the `InnoDB` storage
engine that adhere closely to the ACID model so that data is not
corrupted and results are not distorted by exceptional conditions
such as software crashes and hardware malfunctions. When you rely on
ACID-compliant features, you do not need to reinvent the wheel of
consistency checking and crash recovery mechanisms. In cases where
you have additional software safeguards, ultra-reliable hardware, or
an application that can tolerate a small amount of data loss or
inconsistency, you can adjust MySQL settings to trade some of the
ACID reliability for greater performance or throughput.

The following sections discuss how MySQL features, in particular the
`InnoDB` storage engine, interact with the
categories of the ACID model:

- **A**: atomicity.
- **C**: consistency.
- **I:**: isolation.
- **D**: durability.

### Atomicity

The **atomicity** aspect of the ACID
model mainly involves `InnoDB`
[transactions](glossary.md#glos_transaction "transaction"). Related MySQL
features include:

- The [`autocommit`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_autocommit) setting.
- The [`COMMIT`](commit.md "15.3.1 START TRANSACTION, COMMIT, and ROLLBACK Statements") statement.
- The [`ROLLBACK`](commit.md "15.3.1 START TRANSACTION, COMMIT, and ROLLBACK Statements")
  statement.

### Consistency

The **consistency** aspect of the ACID
model mainly involves internal `InnoDB` processing
to protect data from crashes. Related MySQL features include:

- The `InnoDB` doublewrite buffer. See
  [Section 17.6.4, “Doublewrite Buffer”](innodb-doublewrite-buffer.md "17.6.4 Doublewrite Buffer").
- `InnoDB` crash recovery. See
  [InnoDB Crash Recovery](innodb-recovery.md#innodb-crash-recovery "InnoDB Crash Recovery").

### Isolation

The **isolation** aspect of the ACID
model mainly involves `InnoDB`
[transactions](glossary.md#glos_transaction "transaction"), in particular
the [isolation level](glossary.md#glos_isolation_level "isolation level") that
applies to each transaction. Related MySQL features include:

- The [`autocommit`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_autocommit) setting.
- Transaction isolation levels and the [`SET
  TRANSACTION`](set-transaction.md "15.3.7 SET TRANSACTION Statement") statement. See
  [Section 17.7.2.1, “Transaction Isolation Levels”](innodb-transaction-isolation-levels.md "17.7.2.1 Transaction Isolation Levels").
- The low-level details of `InnoDB`
  [locking](glossary.md#glos_locking "locking"). Details can be
  viewed in the `INFORMATION_SCHEMA` tables (see
  [Section 17.15.2, “InnoDB INFORMATION\_SCHEMA Transaction and Locking Information”](innodb-information-schema-transactions.md "17.15.2 InnoDB INFORMATION_SCHEMA Transaction and Locking Information")) and
  Performance Schema [`data_locks`](performance-schema-data-locks-table.md "29.12.13.1 The data_locks Table") and
  [`data_lock_waits`](performance-schema-data-lock-waits-table.md "29.12.13.2 The data_lock_waits Table") tables.

### Durability

The **durability** aspect of the ACID
model involves MySQL software features interacting with your
particular hardware configuration. Because of the many possibilities
depending on the capabilities of your CPU, network, and storage
devices, this aspect is the most complicated to provide concrete
guidelines for. (And those guidelines might take the form of
“buy new hardware”.) Related MySQL features include:

- The `InnoDB` doublewrite buffer. See
  [Section 17.6.4, “Doublewrite Buffer”](innodb-doublewrite-buffer.md "17.6.4 Doublewrite Buffer").
- The
  [`innodb_flush_log_at_trx_commit`](innodb-parameters.md#sysvar_innodb_flush_log_at_trx_commit)
  variable.
- The [`sync_binlog`](replication-options-binary-log.md#sysvar_sync_binlog) variable.
- The [`innodb_file_per_table`](innodb-parameters.md#sysvar_innodb_file_per_table)
  variable.
- The write buffer in a storage device, such as a disk drive, SSD,
  or RAID array.
- A battery-backed cache in a storage device.
- The operating system used to run MySQL, in particular its
  support for the `fsync()` system call.
- An uninterruptible power supply (UPS) protecting the electrical
  power to all computer servers and storage devices that run MySQL
  servers and store MySQL data.
- Your backup strategy, such as frequency and types of backups,
  and backup retention periods.
- For distributed or hosted data applications, the particular
  characteristics of the data centers where the hardware for the
  MySQL servers is located, and network connections between the
  data centers.
