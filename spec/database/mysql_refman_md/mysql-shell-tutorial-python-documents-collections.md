When you are using MySQL as a Document Store, collections are
containers within a schema that you can create, list, and drop.
Collections contain JSON documents that you can add, find, update,
and remove.

The examples in this section use the
`countryinfo` collection in the
`world_x` schema. For instructions on setting up
the `world_x` schema, see
[Section 22.4.2, “Download and Import world\_x Database”](mysql-shell-tutorial-python-download.md "22.4.2 Download and Import world_x Database").

#### Documents

In MySQL, documents are represented as JSON objects. Internally,
they are stored in an efficient binary format that enables fast
lookups and updates.

- Simple document format for Python:

  ```
  {"field1": "value", "field2" : 10, "field 3": null}
  ```

An array of documents consists of a set of documents separated by
commas and enclosed within `[` and
`]` characters.

- Simple array of documents for Python:

  ```
  [{"Name": "Aruba", "Code:": "ABW"}, {"Name": "Angola", "Code:": "AGO"}]
  ```

MySQL supports the following Python value types in JSON documents:

- numbers (integer and floating point)
- strings
- boolean (False and True)
- None
- arrays of more JSON values
- nested (or embedded) objects of more JSON values

#### Collections

Collections are containers for documents that share a purpose and
possibly share one or more indexes. Each collection has a unique
name and exists within a single schema.

The term schema is equivalent to a database, which means a group
of database objects as opposed to a relational schema, used to
enforce structure and constraints over data. A schema does not
enforce conformity on the documents in a collection.

In this quick-start guide:

- Basic objects include:

  | Object form | Description |
  | --- | --- |
  | `db` | `db` is a global variable assigned to the current active schema. When you want to run operations against the schema, for example to retrieve a collection, you use methods available for the `db` variable. |
  | `db.get_collections()` | [db.get\_collections()](mysql-shell-tutorial-python-collections-operations.md#mysql-shell-tutorial-python-collections-get "List Collections") returns a list of collections in the schema. Use the list to get references to collection objects, iterate over them, and so on. |
- Basic operations scoped by collections include:

  | Operation form | Description |
  | --- | --- |
  | `db.name.add()` | The [add()](mysql-shell-tutorial-python-documents-add.md "22.4.3.2 Working with Collections") method inserts one document or a list of documents into the named collection. |
  | `db.name.find()` | The [find()](mysql-shell-tutorial-python-documents-find.md "22.4.3.3 Find Documents") method returns some or all documents in the named collection. |
  | `db.name.modify()` | The [modify()](mysql-shell-tutorial-python-documents-modify.md "22.4.3.4 Modify Documents") method updates documents in the named collection. |
  | `db.name.remove()` | The [remove()](mysql-shell-tutorial-python-documents-remove.md "22.4.3.5 Remove Documents") method deletes one document or a list of documents from the named collection. |
