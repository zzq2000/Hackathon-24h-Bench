#### 15.7.8.5 LOAD INDEX INTO CACHE Statement

```sql
LOAD INDEX INTO CACHE
  tbl_index_list [, tbl_index_list] ...

tbl_index_list:
  tbl_name
    [PARTITION (partition_list)]
    [{INDEX|KEY} (index_name[, index_name] ...)]
    [IGNORE LEAVES]

partition_list: {
    partition_name[, partition_name] ...
  | ALL
}
```

The [`LOAD INDEX INTO
CACHE`](load-index.md "15.7.8.5 LOAD INDEX INTO CACHE Statement") statement preloads a table index into the key
cache to which it has been assigned by an explicit
[`CACHE INDEX`](cache-index.md "15.7.8.2 CACHE INDEX Statement") statement, or into
the default key cache otherwise.

[`LOAD INDEX INTO
CACHE`](load-index.md "15.7.8.5 LOAD INDEX INTO CACHE Statement") applies only to `MyISAM`
tables, including partitioned `MyISAM` tables.
In addition, indexes on partitioned tables can be preloaded for
one, several, or all partitions.

The `IGNORE LEAVES` modifier causes only blocks
for the nonleaf nodes of the index to be preloaded.

`IGNORE LEAVES` is also supported for
partitioned `MyISAM` tables.

The following statement preloads nodes (index blocks) of indexes
for the tables `t1` and `t2`:

```sql
mysql> LOAD INDEX INTO CACHE t1, t2 IGNORE LEAVES;
+---------+--------------+----------+----------+
| Table   | Op           | Msg_type | Msg_text |
+---------+--------------+----------+----------+
| test.t1 | preload_keys | status   | OK       |
| test.t2 | preload_keys | status   | OK       |
+---------+--------------+----------+----------+
```

This statement preloads all index blocks from
`t1`. It preloads only blocks for the nonleaf
nodes from `t2`.

The syntax of [`LOAD
INDEX INTO CACHE`](load-index.md "15.7.8.5 LOAD INDEX INTO CACHE Statement") enables you to specify that only
particular indexes from a table should be preloaded. However,
the implementation preloads all the table's indexes into the
cache, so there is no reason to specify anything other than the
table name.

It is possible to preload indexes on specific partitions of
partitioned `MyISAM` tables. For example, of
the following 2 statements, the first preloads indexes for
partition `p0` of a partitioned table
`pt`, while the second preloads the indexes for
partitions `p1` and `p3` of
the same table:

```sql
LOAD INDEX INTO CACHE pt PARTITION (p0);
LOAD INDEX INTO CACHE pt PARTITION (p1, p3);
```

To preload the indexes for all partitions in table
`pt`, you can use either of the following two
statements:

```sql
LOAD INDEX INTO CACHE pt PARTITION (ALL);

LOAD INDEX INTO CACHE pt;
```

The two statements just shown are equivalent, and issuing either
one has exactly the same effect. In other words, if you wish to
preload indexes for all partitions of a partitioned table, the
`PARTITION (ALL)` clause is optional.

When preloading indexes for multiple partitions, the partitions
need not be contiguous, and you need not list their names in any
particular order.

[`LOAD INDEX INTO
CACHE ... IGNORE LEAVES`](load-index.md "15.7.8.5 LOAD INDEX INTO CACHE Statement") fails unless all indexes in a
table have the same block size. To determine index block sizes
for a table, use [**myisamchk -dv**](myisamchk.md "6.6.4 myisamchk — MyISAM Table-Maintenance Utility") and check the
`Blocksize` column.
