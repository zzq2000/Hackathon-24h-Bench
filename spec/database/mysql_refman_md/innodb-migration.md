#### 17.6.1.4 Moving or Copying InnoDB Tables

This section describes techniques for moving or copying some or all
`InnoDB` tables to a different server or instance.
For example, you might move an entire MySQL instance to a larger,
faster server; you might clone an entire MySQL instance to a new
replica server; you might copy individual tables to another instance
to develop and test an application, or to a data warehouse server to
produce reports.

On Windows, `InnoDB` always stores database and
table names internally in lowercase. To move databases in a binary
format from Unix to Windows or from Windows to Unix, create all
databases and tables using lowercase names. A convenient way to
accomplish this is to add the following line to the
`[mysqld]` section of your
`my.cnf` or `my.ini` file
before creating any databases or tables:

```ini
[mysqld]
lower_case_table_names=1
```

Note

It is prohibited to start the server with a
[`lower_case_table_names`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_lower_case_table_names) setting
that is different from the setting used when the server was
initialized.

Techniques for moving or copying `InnoDB` tables
include:

- [Importing Tables](innodb-migration.md#copy-tables-import "Importing Tables")
- [MySQL Enterprise Backup](innodb-migration.md#copy-tables-meb "MySQL Enterprise Backup")
- [Copying Data Files (Cold Backup Method)](innodb-migration.md#copy-tables-cold-backup "Copying Data Files (Cold Backup Method)")
- [Restoring from a Logical Backup](innodb-migration.md#copy-tables-logical-backup "Restoring from a Logical Backup")

##### Importing Tables

A table that resides in a file-per-table tablespace can be imported
from another MySQL server instance or from a backup using the
*Transportable Tablespace* feature. See
[Section 17.6.1.3, “Importing InnoDB Tables”](innodb-table-import.md "17.6.1.3 Importing InnoDB Tables").

##### MySQL Enterprise Backup

The MySQL Enterprise Backup product lets you back up a running MySQL database with
minimal disruption to operations while producing a consistent
snapshot of the database. When MySQL Enterprise Backup is copying tables, reads and
writes can continue. In addition, MySQL Enterprise Backup can create compressed backup
files, and back up subsets of tables. In conjunction with the MySQL
binary log, you can perform point-in-time recovery. MySQL Enterprise Backup is
included as part of the MySQL Enterprise subscription.

For more details about MySQL Enterprise Backup, see
[Section 32.1, “MySQL Enterprise Backup Overview”](mysql-enterprise-backup.md "32.1 MySQL Enterprise Backup Overview").

##### Copying Data Files (Cold Backup Method)

You can move an `InnoDB` database simply by copying
all the relevant files listed under "Cold Backups" in
[Section 17.18.1, “InnoDB Backup”](innodb-backup.md "17.18.1 InnoDB Backup").

`InnoDB` data and log files are binary-compatible
on all platforms having the same floating-point number format. If
the floating-point formats differ but you have not used
[`FLOAT`](floating-point-types.md "13.1.4 Floating-Point Types (Approximate Value) - FLOAT, DOUBLE") or
[`DOUBLE`](floating-point-types.md "13.1.4 Floating-Point Types (Approximate Value) - FLOAT, DOUBLE") data types in your tables,
then the procedure is the same: simply copy the relevant files.

When you move or copy file-per-table `.ibd`
files, the database directory name must be the same on the source
and destination systems. The table definition stored in the
`InnoDB` shared tablespace includes the database
name. The transaction IDs and log sequence numbers stored in the
tablespace files also differ between databases.

To move an `.ibd` file and the associated table
from one database to another, use a [`RENAME
TABLE`](rename-table.md "15.1.36 RENAME TABLE Statement") statement:

```sql
RENAME TABLE db1.tbl_name TO db2.tbl_name;
```

If you have a “clean” backup of an
`.ibd` file, you can restore it to the MySQL
installation from which it originated as follows:

1. The table must not have been dropped or truncated since you
   copied the `.ibd` file, because doing so
   changes the table ID stored inside the tablespace.
2. Issue this [`ALTER TABLE`](alter-table.md "15.1.9 ALTER TABLE Statement") statement
   to delete the current `.ibd` file:

   ```sql
   ALTER TABLE tbl_name DISCARD TABLESPACE;
   ```
3. Copy the backup `.ibd` file to the proper
   database directory.
4. Issue this [`ALTER TABLE`](alter-table.md "15.1.9 ALTER TABLE Statement") statement
   to tell `InnoDB` to use the new
   `.ibd` file for the table:

   ```sql
   ALTER TABLE tbl_name IMPORT TABLESPACE;
   ```

   Note

   The [`ALTER TABLE
   ... IMPORT TABLESPACE`](alter-table.md "15.1.9 ALTER TABLE Statement") feature does not enforce
   foreign key constraints on imported data.

In this context, a “clean” `.ibd`
file backup is one for which the following requirements are
satisfied:

- There are no uncommitted modifications by transactions in the
  `.ibd` file.
- There are no unmerged insert buffer entries in the
  `.ibd` file.
- Purge has removed all delete-marked index records from the
  `.ibd` file.
- [**mysqld**](mysqld.md "6.3.1 mysqld — The MySQL Server") has flushed all modified pages of the
  `.ibd` file from the buffer pool to the file.

You can make a clean backup `.ibd` file using the
following method:

1. Stop all activity from the [**mysqld**](mysqld.md "6.3.1 mysqld — The MySQL Server") server and
   commit all transactions.
2. Wait until [`SHOW
   ENGINE INNODB STATUS`](show-engine.md "15.7.7.15 SHOW ENGINE Statement") shows that there are no active
   transactions in the database, and the main thread status of
   `InnoDB` is `Waiting for server
   activity`. Then you can make a copy of the
   `.ibd` file.

Another method for making a clean copy of an
`.ibd` file is to use the MySQL Enterprise Backup product:

1. Use MySQL Enterprise Backup to back up the `InnoDB` installation.
2. Start a second [**mysqld**](mysqld.md "6.3.1 mysqld — The MySQL Server") server on the backup
   and let it clean up the `.ibd` files in the
   backup.

##### Restoring from a Logical Backup

You can use a utility such as [**mysqldump**](mysqldump.md "6.5.4 mysqldump — A Database Backup Program") to
perform a logical backup, which produces a set of SQL statements
that can be executed to reproduce the original database object
definitions and table data for transfer to another SQL server. Using
this method, it does not matter whether the formats differ or if
your tables contain floating-point data.

To improve the performance of this method, disable
[`autocommit`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_autocommit) when importing data.
Perform a commit only after importing an entire table or segment of
a table.
