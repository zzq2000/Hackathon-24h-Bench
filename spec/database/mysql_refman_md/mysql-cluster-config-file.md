Configuring NDB Cluster requires working with two files:

- `my.cnf`: Specifies options for all NDB
  Cluster executables. This file, with which you should be
  familiar with from previous work with MySQL, must be
  accessible by each executable running in the cluster.
- `config.ini`: This file, sometimes known as
  the global configuration
  file, is read only by the NDB Cluster management
  server, which then distributes the information contained
  therein to all processes participating in the cluster.
  `config.ini` contains a description of each
  node involved in the cluster. This includes configuration
  parameters for data nodes and configuration parameters for
  connections between all nodes in the cluster. For a quick
  reference to the sections that can appear in this file, and
  what sorts of configuration parameters may be placed in each
  section, see
  [Sections of
  the `config.ini` File](mysql-cluster-config-example.md#mysql-cluster-config-ini-sections "Sections of the config.ini File").

**Caching of configuration data.**
`NDB` uses stateful
configuration. Rather than reading the global
configuration file every time the management server is
restarted, the management server caches the configuration the
first time it is started, and thereafter, the global
configuration file is read only when one of the following
conditions is true:

- **The management server is started using the --initial option.**
  When [`--initial`](mysql-cluster-programs-ndb-mgmd.md#option_ndb_mgmd_initial) is used, the
  global configuration file is re-read, any existing cache
  files are deleted, and the management server creates a new
  configuration cache.
- **The management server is started using the --reload option.**
  The [`--reload`](mysql-cluster-programs-ndb-mgmd.md#option_ndb_mgmd_reload) option causes
  the management server to compare its cache with the global
  configuration file. If they differ, the management server
  creates a new configuration cache; any existing
  configuration cache is preserved, but not used. If the
  management server's cache and the global configuration
  file contain the same configuration data, then the existing
  cache is used, and no new cache is created.
- **The management server is started using --config-cache=FALSE.**
  This disables
  [`--config-cache`](mysql-cluster-programs-ndb-mgmd.md#option_ndb_mgmd_config-cache) (enabled by
  default), and can be used to force the management server to
  bypass configuration caching altogether. In this case, the
  management server ignores any configuration files that may
  be present, always reading its configuration data from the
  `config.ini` file instead.
- **No configuration cache is found.**
  In this case, the management server reads the global
  configuration file and creates a cache containing the same
  configuration data as found in the file.

**Configuration cache files.**
The management server by default creates configuration cache
files in a directory named `mysql-cluster` in
the MySQL installation directory. (If you build NDB Cluster from
source on a Unix system, the default location is
`/usr/local/mysql-cluster`.) This can be
overridden at runtime by starting the management server with the
[`--configdir`](mysql-cluster-programs-ndb-mgmd.md#option_ndb_mgmd_configdir) option.
Configuration cache files are binary files named according to
the pattern
`ndb_node_id_config.bin.seq_id`,
where *`node_id`* is the management
server's node ID in the cluster, and
*`seq_id`* is a cache identifier. Cache
files are numbered sequentially using
*`seq_id`*, in the order in which they
are created. The management server uses the latest cache file as
determined by the *`seq_id`*.

Note

It is possible to roll back to a previous configuration by
deleting later configuration cache files, or by renaming an
earlier cache file so that it has a higher
*`seq_id`*. However, since configuration
cache files are written in a binary format, you should not
attempt to edit their contents by hand.

[`--reload`](mysql-cluster-programs-ndb-mgmd.md#option_ndb_mgmd_reload) options for the NDB
Cluster management server, see

We are continuously making improvements in NDB Cluster
configuration and attempting to simplify this process. Although we
strive to maintain backward compatibility, there may be times when
introduce an incompatible change. In such cases we try to let NDB
Cluster users know in advance if a change is not backward
compatible. If you find such a change and we have not documented
it, please report it in the MySQL bugs database using the
instructions given in [Section 1.5, “How to Report Bugs or Problems”](bug-reports.md "1.5 How to Report Bugs or Problems").
