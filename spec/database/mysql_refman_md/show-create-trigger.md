#### 15.7.7.11 SHOW CREATE TRIGGER Statement

```sql
SHOW CREATE TRIGGER trigger_name
```

This statement shows the [`CREATE
TRIGGER`](create-trigger.md "15.1.22 CREATE TRIGGER Statement") statement that creates the named trigger. This
statement requires the [`TRIGGER`](privileges-provided.md#priv_trigger)
privilege for the table associated with the trigger.

```sql
mysql> SHOW CREATE TRIGGER ins_sum\G
*************************** 1. row ***************************
               Trigger: ins_sum
              sql_mode: ONLY_FULL_GROUP_BY,STRICT_TRANS_TABLES,

these columns:

- `Trigger`: The trigger name.
- `sql_mode`: The SQL mode in effect when the
  trigger executes.
- `SQL Original Statement`: The
  [`CREATE TRIGGER`](create-trigger.md "15.1.22 CREATE TRIGGER Statement") statement that
  defines the trigger.
- `character_set_client`: The session value
  of the [`character_set_client`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_character_set_client)
  system variable when the trigger was created.

  system variable when the trigger was created.
- `Database Collation`: The collation of the
  database with which the trigger is associated.
- `Created`: The date and time when the
  trigger was created. This is a
  `TIMESTAMP(2)` value (with a fractional
