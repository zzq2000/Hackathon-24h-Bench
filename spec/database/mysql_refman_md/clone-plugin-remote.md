#### 7.6.7.3 Cloning Remote Data

The clone plugin supports the following syntax for cloning
remote data; that is, cloning data from a remote MySQL server
instance (the donor) and transferring it to the MySQL instance
where the cloning operation was initiated (the recipient).

```sql
CLONE INSTANCE FROM 'user'@'host':port
IDENTIFIED BY 'password'
[DATA DIRECTORY [=] 'clone_dir']
[REQUIRE [NO] SSL];
```

where:

- `user` is the
  clone user on the donor MySQL server instance.
- `password` is
  the `user`
  password.
- `host` is the
  [`hostname`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_hostname) address of the
  donor MySQL server instance. Internet Protocol version 6
  (IPv6) address format is not supported. An alias to the IPv6
  address can be used instead. An IPv4 address can be used as
  is.
- `port` is the
  [`port`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_port) number of the donor
  MySQL server instance. (The X Protocol port specified by
  [`mysqlx_port`](x-plugin-options-system-variables.md#sysvar_mysqlx_port) is not
  supported. Connecting to the donor MySQL server instance
  through MySQL Router is also not supported.)
- `DATA DIRECTORY [=]
  'clone_dir'` is an
  optional clause used to specify a directory on the recipient
  for the data you are cloning. Use this option if you do not
  want to remove existing user-created data (schemas, tables,
  tablespaces) and binary logs from the recipient data
  directory. An absolute path is required, and the directory
  must not exist. The MySQL server must have the necessary
  write access to create the directory.

  When the optional `DATA DIRECTORY [=]
  'clone_dir'` clause is
  not used, a cloning operation removes user-created data
  (schemas, tables, tablespaces) and binary logs from the
  recipient data directory, clones the new data to the
  recipient data directory, and automatically restarts the
  server afterward.
- `[REQUIRE [NO] SSL]` explicitly specifies
  whether an encrypted connection is to be used or not when
  transferring cloned data over the network. An error is
  returned if the explicit specification cannot be satisfied.
  If an SSL clause is not specified, clone attempts to
  establish an encrypted connection by default, falling back
  to an insecure connection if the secure connection attempt
  fails. A secure connection is required when cloning
  encrypted data regardless of whether this clause is
  specified. For more information, see
  [Configuring an Encrypted Connection for Cloning](clone-plugin-remote.md#clone-plugin-remote-ssl "Configuring an Encrypted Connection for Cloning").

Note

By default, user-created `InnoDB` tables and
tablespaces that reside in the data directory on the donor
MySQL server instance are cloned to the data directory on the
recipient MySQL server instance. If the `DATA
DIRECTORY [=] 'clone_dir'`
clause is specified, they are cloned to the specified
directory.

User-created `InnoDB` tables and tablespaces
that reside outside of the data directory on the donor MySQL
server instance are cloned to the same path on the recipient
MySQL server instance. An error is reported if a table or
tablespace already exists.

By default, the `InnoDB` system tablespace,
redo logs, and undo tablespaces are cloned to the same
locations that are configured on the donor (as defined by
[`innodb_data_home_dir`](innodb-parameters.md#sysvar_innodb_data_home_dir) and
[`innodb_data_file_path`](innodb-parameters.md#sysvar_innodb_data_file_path),
[`innodb_log_group_home_dir`](innodb-parameters.md#sysvar_innodb_log_group_home_dir),
and [`innodb_undo_directory`](innodb-parameters.md#sysvar_innodb_undo_directory),
respectively). If the `DATA DIRECTORY [=]
'clone_dir'` clause is
specified, those tablespaces and logs are cloned to the
specified directory.

##### Remote Cloning Prerequisites

To perform a cloning operation, the clone plugin must be
active on both the donor and recipient MySQL server instances.
For installation instructions, see
[Section 7.6.7.1, “Installing the Clone Plugin”](clone-plugin-installation.md "7.6.7.1 Installing the Clone Plugin").

A MySQL user on the donor and recipient is required for
executing the cloning operation (the “clone
user”).

- On the donor, the clone user requires the
  [`BACKUP_ADMIN`](privileges-provided.md#priv_backup-admin) privilege for
  accessing and transferring data from the donor and
  blocking concurrent DDL during the cloning operation.
  Concurrent DDL during the cloning operation is blocked on
  the donor prior to MySQL 8.0.27. From MySQL 8.0.27,
  concurrent DDL is permitted on the donor by default. See
  [Section 7.6.7.4, “Cloning and Concurrent DDL”](clone-plugin-concurrent-ddl.md "7.6.7.4 Cloning and Concurrent DDL").
- On the recipient, the clone user requires the
  [`CLONE_ADMIN`](privileges-provided.md#priv_clone-admin) privilege for
  replacing recipient data, blocking DDL on the recipient
  during the cloning operation, and automatically restarting
  the server. The [`CLONE_ADMIN`](privileges-provided.md#priv_clone-admin)
  privilege includes
  [`BACKUP_ADMIN`](privileges-provided.md#priv_backup-admin) and
  [`SHUTDOWN`](privileges-provided.md#priv_shutdown) privileges
  implicitly.

Instructions for creating the clone user and granting the
required privileges are included in the remote cloning example
that follows this prerequisite information.

The following prerequisites are checked when the
[`CLONE
INSTANCE`](clone.md "15.7.5 CLONE Statement") statement is executed:

- The clone plugin is supported in MySQL 8.0.17 and higher.
  The donor and recipient must be the same MySQL server
  series, such as 8.0.37 and 8.0.41. They must also be the
  same point release for versions before 8.0.37.

  ```sql
  mysql> SHOW VARIABLES LIKE 'version';
   +---------------+--------+
  | Variable_name | Value  |
  +---------------+--------+
  | version       | 8.0.45 |
  +---------------+--------+
  ```

  Cloning from a donor MySQL server instance to a hotfix
  MySQL server instance of the same version and release is
  supported as of MySQL 8.0.26.

  Cloning from different point releases within a series is
  supported as of MySQL 8.0.37. Previous restrictions still
  apply to versions older than 8.0.37. For example, cloning
  8.0.36 to 8.0.42 or vice-versa is not permitted.
- The donor and recipient MySQL server instances must run on
  the same operating system and platform. For example, if
  the donor instance runs on a Linux 64-bit platform, the
  recipient instance must also run on that platform. Refer
  to your operating system documentation for information
  about how to determine your operating system platform.
- The recipient must have enough disk space for the cloned
  data. By default, user-created data (schemas, tables,
  tablespaces) and binary logs are removed on the recipient
  prior to cloning the donor data, so you only require
  enough space for the donor data. If you clone to a named
  directory using the `DATA DIRECTORY`
  clause, you must have enough disk space for the existing
  recipient data and the cloned data. You can estimate the
  size of your data by checking the data directory size on
  your file system and the size of any tablespaces that
  reside outside of the data directory. When estimating data
  size on the donor, remember that only
  `InnoDB` data is cloned. If you store
  data in other storage engines, adjust your data size
  estimate accordingly.
- `InnoDB` permits creating some tablespace
  types outside of the data directory. If the donor MySQL
  server instance has tablespaces that reside outside of the
  data directory, the cloning operation must be able access
  those tablespaces. You can query the Information Schema
  [`FILES`](information-schema-files-table.md "28.3.15 The INFORMATION_SCHEMA FILES Table") table to identify
  tablespaces that reside outside of the data directory.
  Files that reside outside of the data directory have a
  fully qualified path to a directory other than the data
  directory.

  ```sql
  mysql> SELECT FILE_NAME FROM INFORMATION_SCHEMA.FILES;
  ```
- Plugins that are active on the donor, including any
  keyring plugin, must also be active on the recipient. You
  can identify active plugins by issuing a
  [`SHOW PLUGINS`](show-plugins.md "15.7.7.25 SHOW PLUGINS Statement") statement or
  by querying the Information Schema
  [`PLUGINS`](information-schema-plugins-table.md "28.3.22 The INFORMATION_SCHEMA PLUGINS Table") table.
- The donor and recipient must have the same MySQL server
  character set and collation. For information about MySQL
  server character set and collation configuration, see
  [Section 12.15, “Character Set Configuration”](charset-configuration.md "12.15 Character Set Configuration").
- The same [`innodb_page_size`](innodb-parameters.md#sysvar_innodb_page_size)
  and [`innodb_data_file_path`](innodb-parameters.md#sysvar_innodb_data_file_path)
  settings are required on the donor and recipient. The
  [`innodb_data_file_path`](innodb-parameters.md#sysvar_innodb_data_file_path)
  setting on the donor and recipient must specify the same
  number of data files of an equivalent size. You can check
  variable settings using [`SHOW
  VARIABLES`](show-variables.md "15.7.7.41 SHOW VARIABLES Statement") syntax.

  ```sql
  mysql> SHOW VARIABLES LIKE 'innodb_page_size';
  mysql> SHOW VARIABLES LIKE 'innodb_data_file_path';
  ```
- If cloning encrypted or page-compressed data, the donor
  and recipient must have the same file system block size.
  For page-compressed data, the recipient file system must
  support sparse files and hole punching for hole punching
  to occur on the recipient. For information about these
  features and how to identify tables and tablespaces that
  use them, see
  [Section 7.6.7.5, “Cloning Encrypted Data”](clone-plugin-encrypted-data.md "7.6.7.5 Cloning Encrypted Data"), and
  [Section 7.6.7.6, “Cloning Compressed Data”](clone-plugin-compressed-data.md "7.6.7.6 Cloning Compressed Data"). To
  determine your file system block size, refer to your
  operating system documentation.
- A secure connection is required if you are cloning
  encrypted data. See
  [Configuring an Encrypted Connection for Cloning](clone-plugin-remote.md#clone-plugin-remote-ssl "Configuring an Encrypted Connection for Cloning").
- The
  [`clone_valid_donor_list`](clone-plugin-options-variables.md#sysvar_clone_valid_donor_list)
  setting on the recipient must include the host address of
  the donor MySQL server instance. You can only clone data
  from a host on the valid donor list. A MySQL user with the
  [`SYSTEM_VARIABLES_ADMIN`](privileges-provided.md#priv_system-variables-admin)
  privilege is required to configure this variable.
  Instructions for setting the
  [`clone_valid_donor_list`](clone-plugin-options-variables.md#sysvar_clone_valid_donor_list)
  variable are provided in the remote cloning example that
  follows this section. You can check the
  [`clone_valid_donor_list`](clone-plugin-options-variables.md#sysvar_clone_valid_donor_list)
  setting using [`SHOW
  VARIABLES`](show-variables.md "15.7.7.41 SHOW VARIABLES Statement") syntax.

  ```sql
  mysql> SHOW VARIABLES LIKE 'clone_valid_donor_list';
  ```
- There must be no other cloning operation running. Only a
  single cloning operation is permitted at a time. To
  determine if a clone operation is running, query the
  [`clone_status`](performance-schema-clone-status-table.md "29.12.19.1 The clone_status Table") table. See
  [Monitoring Cloning Operations using Performance Schema Clone Tables](clone-plugin-monitoring.md#clone-plugin-monitoring-performance-schema-clone-tables "Monitoring Cloning Operations using Performance Schema Clone Tables").
- The clone plugin transfers data in 1MB packets plus
  metadata. The minimum required
  [`max_allowed_packet`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_max_allowed_packet) value
  is therefore 2MB on the donor and the recipient MySQL
  server instances. A
  [`max_allowed_packet`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_max_allowed_packet) value
  less than 2MB results in an error. Use the following query
  to check your
  [`max_allowed_packet`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_max_allowed_packet)
  setting:

  ```sql
  mysql> SHOW VARIABLES LIKE 'max_allowed_packet';
  ```

The following prerequisites also apply:

- Undo tablespace file names on the donor must be unique.
  When data is cloned to the recipient, undo tablespaces,
  regardless of their location on the donor, are cloned to
  the [`innodb_undo_directory`](innodb-parameters.md#sysvar_innodb_undo_directory)
  location on the recipient or to the directory specified by
  the `DATA DIRECTORY [=]
  'clone_dir'` clause,
  if used. Duplicate undo tablespace file names on the donor
  are not permitted for this reason. As of MySQL 8.0.18, an
  error is reported if duplicate undo tablespace file names
  are encountered during a cloning operation. Prior to MySQL
  8.0.18, cloning undo tablespaces with the same file name
  could result in undo tablespace files being overwritten on
  the recipient.

  To view undo tablespace file names on the donor to ensure
  that they are unique, query
  [`INFORMATION_SCHEMA.FILES`](information-schema-files-table.md "28.3.15 The INFORMATION_SCHEMA FILES Table"):

  ```sql
  mysql> SELECT TABLESPACE_NAME, FILE_NAME FROM INFORMATION_SCHEMA.FILES
         WHERE FILE_TYPE LIKE 'UNDO LOG';
  ```

  For information about dropping and adding undo tablespace
  files, see [Section 17.6.3.4, “Undo Tablespaces”](innodb-undo-tablespaces.md "17.6.3.4 Undo Tablespaces").
- By default, the recipient MySQL server instance is
  restarted (stopped and started) automatically after the
  data is cloned. For an automatic restart to occur, a
  monitoring process must be available on the recipient to
  detect server shutdowns. Otherwise, the cloning operation
  halts with the following error after the data is cloned,
  and the recipient MySQL server instance is shut down:

  ```terminal
  ERROR 3707 (HY000): Restart server failed (mysqld is not managed by supervisor process).
  ```

  This error does not indicate a cloning failure. It means
  that the recipient MySQL server instance must be started
  again manually after the data is cloned. After starting
  the server manually, you can connect to the recipient
  MySQL server instance and check the Performance Schema
  clone tables to verify that the cloning operation
  completed successfully (see
  [Monitoring Cloning Operations using Performance Schema Clone Tables](clone-plugin-monitoring.md#clone-plugin-monitoring-performance-schema-clone-tables "Monitoring Cloning Operations using Performance Schema Clone Tables").)
  The [`RESTART`](restart.md "15.7.8.8 RESTART Statement") statement has
  the same monitoring process requirement. For more
  information, see [Section 15.7.8.8, “RESTART Statement”](restart.md "15.7.8.8 RESTART Statement"). This
  requirement is not applicable if cloning to a named
  directory using the `DATA DIRECTORY`
  clause, as an automatic restart is not performed in this
  case.
- Several variables control various aspects of a remote
  cloning operation. Before performing a remote cloning
  operation, review the variables and adjust settings as
  necessary to suit your computing environment. Clone
  variables are set on recipient MySQL server instance where
  the cloning operation is executed. See
  [Section 7.6.7.13, “Clone System Variables”](clone-plugin-options-variables.md "7.6.7.13 Clone System Variables").

##### Cloning Remote Data

The following example demonstrates cloning remote data. By
default, a remote cloning operation removes user-created data
(schemas, tables, tablespaces) and binary logs on the
recipient, clones the new data to the recipient data
directory, and restarts the MySQL server afterward.

The example assumes that remote cloning prerequisites are met.
See [Remote Cloning Prerequisites](clone-plugin-remote.md#clone-remote-prerequisites "Remote Cloning Prerequisites").

1. Login to the donor MySQL server instance with an
   administrative user account.

   1. Create a clone user with the
      [`BACKUP_ADMIN`](privileges-provided.md#priv_backup-admin) privilege.

      ```sql
      mysql> CREATE USER 'donor_clone_user'@'example.donor.host.com' IDENTIFIED BY 'password';
      mysql> GRANT BACKUP_ADMIN on *.* to 'donor_clone_user'@'example.donor.host.com';
      ```
   2. Install the clone plugin:

      ```sql
      mysql> INSTALL PLUGIN clone SONAME 'mysql_clone.so';
      ```
2. Login to the recipient MySQL server instance with an
   administrative user account.

   1. Create a clone user with the
      [`CLONE_ADMIN`](privileges-provided.md#priv_clone-admin) privilege.

      ```sql
      mysql> CREATE USER 'recipient_clone_user'@'example.recipient.host.com' IDENTIFIED BY 'password';
      mysql> GRANT CLONE_ADMIN on *.* to 'recipient_clone_user'@'example.recipient.host.com';
      ```
   2. Install the clone plugin:

      ```sql
      mysql> INSTALL PLUGIN clone SONAME 'mysql_clone.so';
      ```
   3. Add the host address of the donor MySQL server
      instance to the
      [`clone_valid_donor_list`](clone-plugin-options-variables.md#sysvar_clone_valid_donor_list)
      variable setting.

      ```sql
      mysql> SET GLOBAL clone_valid_donor_list = 'example.donor.host.com:3306';
      ```
3. Log on to the recipient MySQL server instance as the clone
   user you created previously
   (`recipient_clone_user'@'example.recipient.host.com`)
   and execute the
   [`CLONE
   INSTANCE`](clone.md "15.7.5 CLONE Statement") statement.

   ```sql
   mysql> CLONE INSTANCE FROM 'donor_clone_user'@'example.donor.host.com':3306
          IDENTIFIED BY 'password';
   ```

   After the data is cloned, the MySQL server instance on the
   recipient is restarted automatically.

   For information about monitoring cloning operation status
   and progress, see
   [Section 7.6.7.10, “Monitoring Cloning Operations”](clone-plugin-monitoring.md "7.6.7.10 Monitoring Cloning Operations").

##### Cloning to a Named Directory

By default, a remote cloning operation removes user-created
data (schemas, tables, tablespaces) and binary logs from the
recipient data directory before cloning data from the donor
MySQL Server instance. By cloning to a named directory, you
can avoid removing data from the current recipient data
directory.

The procedure for cloning to a named directory is the same
procedure described in
[Cloning Remote Data](clone-plugin-remote.md#clone-plugin-remote-example "Cloning Remote Data") with one
exception: The [`CLONE
INSTANCE`](clone.md "15.7.5 CLONE Statement") statement must include the `DATA
DIRECTORY` clause. For example:

```sql
mysql> CLONE INSTANCE FROM 'user'@'example.donor.host.com':3306
       IDENTIFIED BY 'password'
       DATA DIRECTORY = '/path/to/clone_dir';
```

An absolute path is required, and the directory must not
exist. The MySQL server must have the necessary write access
to create the directory.

When cloning to a named directory, the recipient MySQL server
instance is not restarted automatically after the data is
cloned. If you want to restart the MySQL server on the named
directory, you must do so manually:

```terminal
$> mysqld_safe --datadir=/path/to/clone_dir
```

where *`/path/to/clone_dir`* is the
path to the named directory on the recipient.

##### Configuring an Encrypted Connection for Cloning

You can configure an encrypted connection for remote cloning
operations to protect data as it is cloned over the network.
An encrypted connection is required by default when cloning
encrypted data. (see
[Section 7.6.7.5, “Cloning Encrypted Data”](clone-plugin-encrypted-data.md "7.6.7.5 Cloning Encrypted Data").)

The instructions that follow describe how to configure the
recipient MySQL server instance to use an encrypted
connection. It is assumed that the donor MySQL server instance
is already configured to use encrypted connections. If not,
refer to [Section 8.3.1, “Configuring MySQL to Use Encrypted Connections”](using-encrypted-connections.md "8.3.1 Configuring MySQL to Use Encrypted Connections") for
server-side configuration instructions.

To configure the recipient MySQL server instance to use an
encrypted connection:

1. Make the client certificate and key files of the donor
   MySQL server instance available to the recipient host.
   Either distribute the files to the recipient host using a
   secure channel or place them on a mounted partition that
   is accessible to the recipient host. The client
   certificate and key files to make available include:

   - `ca.pem`

     The self-signed certificate authority (CA) file.
   - `client-cert.pem`

     The client public key certificate file.
   - `client-key.pem`

     The client private key file.
2. Configure the following SSL options on the recipient MySQL
   server instance.

   - [`clone_ssl_ca`](clone-plugin-options-variables.md#sysvar_clone_ssl_ca)

     Specifies the path to the self-signed certificate
     authority (CA) file.
   - [`clone_ssl_cert`](clone-plugin-options-variables.md#sysvar_clone_ssl_cert)

     Specifies the path to the client public key
     certificate file.
   - [`clone_ssl_key`](clone-plugin-options-variables.md#sysvar_clone_ssl_key)

     Specifies the path to the client private key file.

   For example:

   ```ini
   clone_ssl_ca=/path/to/ca.pem
   clone_ssl_cert=/path/to/client-cert.pem
   clone_ssl_key=/path/to/client-key.pem
   ```
3. To require that an encrypted connection is used, include
   the `REQUIRE SSL` clause when issuing the
   [`CLONE`](clone.md "15.7.5 CLONE Statement") statement on the
   recipient.

   ```sql
   mysql> CLONE INSTANCE FROM 'user'@'example.donor.host.com':3306
          IDENTIFIED BY 'password'
          DATA DIRECTORY = '/path/to/clone_dir'
          REQUIRE SSL;
   ```

   If an SSL clause is not specified, the clone plugin
   attempts to establish an encrypted connection by default,
   falling back to an unencrypted connection if the encrypted
   connection attempt fails.

   Note

   If you are cloning encrypted data, an encrypted
   connection is required by default regardless of whether
   the `REQUIRE SSL` clause is specified.
   Using `REQUIRE NO SSL` causes an error
   if you attempt to clone encrypted data.
