### 2.10.3 Problems Using the Perl DBI/DBD Interface

If Perl reports that it cannot find the
`../mysql/mysql.so` module, the problem is
probably that Perl cannot locate the
`libmysqlclient.so` shared library. You should
be able to fix this problem by one of the following methods:

- Copy `libmysqlclient.so` to the directory
  where your other shared libraries are located (probably
  `/usr/lib` or `/lib`).
- Modify the `-L` options used to compile
  `DBD::mysql` to reflect the actual location
  of `libmysqlclient.so`.
- On Linux, you can add the path name of the directory where
  `libmysqlclient.so` is located to the
  `/etc/ld.so.conf` file.
- Add the path name of the directory where
  `libmysqlclient.so` is located to the
  `LD_RUN_PATH` environment variable. Some
  systems use `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` instead.

Note that you may also need to modify the `-L`
options if there are other libraries that the linker fails to
find. For example, if the linker cannot find
`libc` because it is in `/lib`
and the link command specifies `-L/usr/lib`, change
the `-L` option to `-L/lib` or add
`-L/lib` to the existing link command.

If you get the following errors from
`DBD::mysql`, you are probably using
**gcc** (or using an old binary compiled with
**gcc**):

```none
/usr/bin/perl: can't resolve symbol '__moddi3'
/usr/bin/perl: can't resolve symbol '__divdi3'
```

Add `-L/usr/lib/gcc-lib/... -lgcc` to the link
command when the `mysql.so` library gets built
(check the output from **make** for
`mysql.so` when you compile the Perl client).
The `-L` option should specify the path name of the
directory where `libgcc.a` is located on your
system.

Another cause of this problem may be that Perl and MySQL are not
both compiled with **gcc**. In this case, you can
solve the mismatch by compiling both with **gcc**.
