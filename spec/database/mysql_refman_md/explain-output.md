### 10.8.2 EXPLAIN Output Format

The [`EXPLAIN`](explain.md "15.8.2 EXPLAIN Statement") statement provides
information about how MySQL executes statements.
[`EXPLAIN`](explain.md "15.8.2 EXPLAIN Statement") works with
[`SELECT`](select.md "15.2.13 SELECT Statement"),
[`DELETE`](delete.md "15.2.2 DELETE Statement"),
[`INSERT`](insert.md "15.2.7 INSERT Statement"),
[`REPLACE`](replace.md "15.2.12 REPLACE Statement"), and
[`UPDATE`](update.md "15.2.17 UPDATE Statement") statements.

[`EXPLAIN`](explain.md "15.8.2 EXPLAIN Statement") returns a row of
information for each table used in the
[`SELECT`](select.md "15.2.13 SELECT Statement") statement. It lists the
tables in the output in the order that MySQL would read them
while processing the statement. This means that MySQL reads a
row from the first table, then finds a matching row in the
second table, and then in the third table, and so on. When all
tables are processed, MySQL outputs the selected columns and
backtracks through the table list until a table is found for
which there are more matching rows. The next row is read from
this table and the process continues with the next table.

Note

MySQL Workbench has a Visual Explain capability that provides a
visual representation of
[`EXPLAIN`](explain.md "15.8.2 EXPLAIN Statement") output. See
[Tutorial: Using Explain to Improve Query Performance](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/workbench/en/wb-tutorial-visual-explain-dbt3.html).

#### EXPLAIN Output Columns

This section describes the output columns produced by
[`EXPLAIN`](explain.md "15.8.2 EXPLAIN Statement"). Later sections provide
additional information about the
[`type`](explain-output.md#explain-join-types "EXPLAIN Join Types")
and
[`Extra`](explain-output.md#explain-extra-information "EXPLAIN Extra Information")
columns.

Each output row from [`EXPLAIN`](explain.md "15.8.2 EXPLAIN Statement")
provides information about one table. Each row contains the
values summarized in
[Table 10.1, “EXPLAIN Output Columns”](explain-output.md#explain-output-column-table "Table 10.1 EXPLAIN Output Columns"), and described
in more detail following the table. Column names are shown in
the table's first column; the second column provides the
equivalent property name shown in the output when
`FORMAT=JSON` is used.

**Table 10.1 EXPLAIN Output Columns**

| Column | JSON Name | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- |
| [`id`](explain-output.md#explain_id) | `select_id` | The `SELECT` identifier |
| [`select_type`](explain-output.md#explain_select_type) | None | The `SELECT` type |
| [`table`](explain-output.md#explain_table) | `table_name` | The table for the output row |
| [`partitions`](explain-output.md#explain_partitions) | `partitions` | The matching partitions |
| [`type`](explain-output.md#explain_type) | `access_type` | The join type |
| [`possible_keys`](explain-output.md#explain_possible_keys) | `possible_keys` | The possible indexes to choose |
| [`key`](explain-output.md#explain_key) | `key` | The index actually chosen |
| [`key_len`](explain-output.md#explain_key_len) | `key_length` | The length of the chosen key |
| [`ref`](explain-output.md#explain_ref) | `ref` | The columns compared to the index |
| [`rows`](explain-output.md#explain_rows) | `rows` | Estimate of rows to be examined |
| [`filtered`](explain-output.md#explain_filtered) | `filtered` | Percentage of rows filtered by table condition |
| [`Extra`](explain-output.md#explain_extra) | None | Additional information |

Note

JSON properties which are `NULL` are not
displayed in JSON-formatted `EXPLAIN`
output.

- `id` (JSON name:
  `select_id`)

  The [`SELECT`](select.md "15.2.13 SELECT Statement") identifier. This
  is the sequential number of the
  [`SELECT`](select.md "15.2.13 SELECT Statement") within the query.
  The value can be `NULL` if the row refers
  to the union result of other rows. In this case, the
  `table` column shows a value like
  `<unionM,N>`
  to indicate that the row refers to the union of the rows
  with `id` values of
  *`M`* and
  *`N`*.
- `select_type` (JSON name: none)

  The type of [`SELECT`](select.md "15.2.13 SELECT Statement"), which
  can be any of those shown in the following table. A
  JSON-formatted `EXPLAIN` exposes the
  `SELECT` type as a property of a
  `query_block`, unless it is
  `SIMPLE` or `PRIMARY`.
  The JSON names (where applicable) are also shown in the
  table.

  | `select_type` Value | JSON Name | Meaning |
  | --- | --- | --- |
  | `SIMPLE` | None | Simple [`SELECT`](select.md "15.2.13 SELECT Statement") (not using [`UNION`](union.md "15.2.18 UNION Clause") or subqueries) |
  | `PRIMARY` | None | Outermost [`SELECT`](select.md "15.2.13 SELECT Statement") |
  | [`UNION`](union.md "15.2.18 UNION Clause") | None | Second or later [`SELECT`](select.md "15.2.13 SELECT Statement") statement in a [`UNION`](union.md "15.2.18 UNION Clause") |
  | `DEPENDENT UNION` | `dependent` (`true`) | Second or later [`SELECT`](select.md "15.2.13 SELECT Statement") statement in a [`UNION`](union.md "15.2.18 UNION Clause"), dependent on outer query |
  | `UNION RESULT` | `union_result` | Result of a [`UNION`](union.md "15.2.18 UNION Clause"). |
  | [`SUBQUERY`](optimizer-hints.md#optimizer-hints-subquery "Subquery Optimizer Hints") | None | First [`SELECT`](select.md "15.2.13 SELECT Statement") in subquery |
  | `DEPENDENT SUBQUERY` | `dependent` (`true`) | First [`SELECT`](select.md "15.2.13 SELECT Statement") in subquery, dependent on outer query |
  | `DERIVED` | None | Derived table |
  | `DEPENDENT DERIVED` | `dependent` (`true`) | Derived table dependent on another table |
  | `MATERIALIZED` | `materialized_from_subquery` | Materialized subquery |
  | `UNCACHEABLE SUBQUERY` | `cacheable` (`false`) | A subquery for which the result cannot be cached and must be re-evaluated for each row of the outer query |
  | `UNCACHEABLE UNION` | `cacheable` (`false`) | The second or later select in a [`UNION`](union.md "15.2.18 UNION Clause") that belongs to an uncacheable subquery (see `UNCACHEABLE SUBQUERY`) |

  `DEPENDENT` typically signifies the use
  of a correlated subquery. See
  [Section 15.2.15.7, “Correlated Subqueries”](correlated-subqueries.md "15.2.15.7 Correlated Subqueries").

  `DEPENDENT SUBQUERY` evaluation differs
  from `UNCACHEABLE SUBQUERY` evaluation.
  For `DEPENDENT SUBQUERY`, the subquery is
  re-evaluated only once for each set of different values of
  the variables from its outer context. For
  `UNCACHEABLE SUBQUERY`, the subquery is
  re-evaluated for each row of the outer context.

  When you specify `FORMAT=JSON` with
  `EXPLAIN`, the output has no single
  property directly equivalent to
  `select_type`; the
  `query_block` property corresponds to a
  given `SELECT`. Properties equivalent to
  most of the `SELECT` subquery types just
  shown are available (an example being
  `materialized_from_subquery` for
  `MATERIALIZED`), and are displayed when
  appropriate. There are no JSON equivalents for
  `SIMPLE` or `PRIMARY`.

  The `select_type` value for
  non-[`SELECT`](select.md "15.2.13 SELECT Statement") statements
  displays the statement type for affected tables. For
  example, `select_type` is
  `DELETE` for
  [`DELETE`](delete.md "15.2.2 DELETE Statement") statements.
- `table` (JSON name:
  `table_name`)

  The name of the table to which the row of output refers.
  This can also be one of the following values:

  - `<unionM,N>`:
    The row refers to the union of the rows with
    `id` values of
    *`M`* and
    *`N`*.
  - `<derivedN>`:
    The row refers to the derived table result for the row
    with an `id` value of
    *`N`*. A derived table may
    result, for example, from a subquery in the
    `FROM` clause.
  - `<subqueryN>`:
    The row refers to the result of a materialized
    subquery for the row with an `id`
    value of *`N`*. See
    [Section 10.2.2.2, “Optimizing Subqueries with Materialization”](subquery-materialization.md "10.2.2.2 Optimizing Subqueries with Materialization").
- `partitions` (JSON name:
  `partitions`)

  The partitions from which records would be matched by the
  query. The value is `NULL` for
  nonpartitioned tables. See
  [Section 26.3.5, “Obtaining Information About Partitions”](partitioning-info.md "26.3.5 Obtaining Information About Partitions").
- `type` (JSON name:
  `access_type`)

  The join type. For descriptions of the different types,
  see
  [`EXPLAIN`
  Join Types](explain-output.md#explain-join-types "EXPLAIN Join Types").
- `possible_keys` (JSON name:
  `possible_keys`)

  The `possible_keys` column indicates the
  indexes from which MySQL can choose to find the rows in
  this table. Note that this column is totally independent
  of the order of the tables as displayed in the output from
  [`EXPLAIN`](explain.md "15.8.2 EXPLAIN Statement"). That means that
  some of the keys in `possible_keys` might
  not be usable in practice with the generated table order.

  If this column is `NULL` (or undefined in
  JSON-formatted output), there are no relevant indexes. In
  this case, you may be able to improve the performance of
  your query by examining the `WHERE`
  clause to check whether it refers to some column or
  columns that would be suitable for indexing. If so, create
  an appropriate index and check the query with
  [`EXPLAIN`](explain.md "15.8.2 EXPLAIN Statement") again. See
  [Section 15.1.9, “ALTER TABLE Statement”](alter-table.md "15.1.9 ALTER TABLE Statement").

  To see what indexes a table has, use `SHOW INDEX
  FROM tbl_name`.
- `key` (JSON name: `key`)

  The `key` column indicates the key
  (index) that MySQL actually decided to use. If MySQL
  decides to use one of the `possible_keys`
  indexes to look up rows, that index is listed as the key
  value.

  It is possible that `key` may name an
  index that is not present in the
  `possible_keys` value. This can happen if
  none of the `possible_keys` indexes are
  suitable for looking up rows, but all the columns selected
  by the query are columns of some other index. That is, the
  named index covers the selected columns, so although it is
  not used to determine which rows to retrieve, an index
  scan is more efficient than a data row scan.

  For `InnoDB`, a secondary index might
  cover the selected columns even if the query also selects
  the primary key because `InnoDB` stores
  the primary key value with each secondary index. If
  `key` is `NULL`, MySQL
  found no index to use for executing the query more
  efficiently.

  To force MySQL to use or ignore an index listed in the
  `possible_keys` column, use
  `FORCE INDEX`, `USE
  INDEX`, or `IGNORE INDEX` in
  your query. See [Section 10.9.4, “Index Hints”](index-hints.md "10.9.4 Index Hints").

  For `MyISAM` tables, running
  [`ANALYZE TABLE`](analyze-table.md "15.7.3.1 ANALYZE TABLE Statement") helps the
  optimizer choose better indexes. For
  `MyISAM` tables, [**myisamchk
  --analyze**](myisamchk.md "6.6.4 myisamchk — MyISAM Table-Maintenance Utility") does the same. See
  [Section 15.7.3.1, “ANALYZE TABLE Statement”](analyze-table.md "15.7.3.1 ANALYZE TABLE Statement"), and
  [Section 9.6, “MyISAM Table Maintenance and Crash Recovery”](myisam-table-maintenance.md "9.6 MyISAM Table Maintenance and Crash Recovery").
- `key_len` (JSON name:
  `key_length`)

  The `key_len` column indicates the length
  of the key that MySQL decided to use. The value of
  `key_len` enables you to determine how
  many parts of a multiple-part key MySQL actually uses. If
  the `key` column says
  `NULL`, the `key_len`
  column also says `NULL`.

  Due to the key storage format, the key length is one
  greater for a column that can be `NULL`
  than for a `NOT NULL` column.
- `ref` (JSON name: `ref`)

  The `ref` column shows which columns or
  constants are compared to the index named in the
  `key` column to select rows from the
  table.

  If the value is `func`, the value used is
  the result of some function. To see which function, use
  [`SHOW WARNINGS`](show-warnings.md "15.7.7.42 SHOW WARNINGS Statement") following
  [`EXPLAIN`](explain.md "15.8.2 EXPLAIN Statement") to see the extended
  [`EXPLAIN`](explain.md "15.8.2 EXPLAIN Statement") output. The
  function might actually be an operator such as an
  arithmetic operator.
- `rows` (JSON name:
  `rows`)

  The `rows` column indicates the number of
  rows MySQL believes it must examine to execute the query.

  For [`InnoDB`](innodb-storage-engine.md "Chapter 17 The InnoDB Storage Engine") tables, this
  number is an estimate, and may not always be exact.
- `filtered` (JSON name:
  `filtered`)

  The `filtered` column indicates an
  estimated percentage of table rows that are filtered by
  the table condition. The maximum value is 100, which means
  no filtering of rows occurred. Values decreasing from 100
  indicate increasing amounts of filtering.
  `rows` shows the estimated number of rows
  examined and `rows` ×
  `filtered` shows the number of rows that
  are joined with the following table. For example, if
  `rows` is 1000 and
  `filtered` is 50.00 (50%), the number of
  rows to be joined with the following table is 1000 ×
  50% = 500.
- `Extra` (JSON name: none)

  This column contains additional information about how
  MySQL resolves the query. For descriptions of the
  different values, see
  [`EXPLAIN`
  Extra Information](explain-output.md#explain-extra-information "EXPLAIN Extra Information").

  There is no single JSON property corresponding to the
  `Extra` column; however, values that can
  occur in this column are exposed as JSON properties, or as
  the text of the `message` property.

#### EXPLAIN Join Types

The `type` column of
[`EXPLAIN`](explain.md "15.8.2 EXPLAIN Statement") output describes how
tables are joined. In JSON-formatted output, these are found
as values of the `access_type` property. The
following list describes the join types, ordered from the best
type to the worst:

- [`system`](explain-output.md#jointype_system)

  The table has only one row (= system table). This is a
  special case of the
  [`const`](explain-output.md#jointype_const) join type.
- [`const`](explain-output.md#jointype_const)

  The table has at most one matching row, which is read at
  the start of the query. Because there is only one row,
  values from the column in this row can be regarded as
  constants by the rest of the optimizer.
  [`const`](explain-output.md#jointype_const) tables are very
  fast because they are read only once.

  [`const`](explain-output.md#jointype_const) is used when you
  compare all parts of a `PRIMARY KEY` or
  `UNIQUE` index to constant values. In the
  following queries, *`tbl_name`* can
  be used as a [`const`](explain-output.md#jointype_const)
  table:

  ```sql
  SELECT * FROM tbl_name WHERE primary_key=1;

  SELECT * FROM tbl_name
    WHERE primary_key_part1=1 AND primary_key_part2=2;
  ```
- [`eq_ref`](explain-output.md#jointype_eq_ref)

  One row is read from this table for each combination of
  rows from the previous tables. Other than the
  [`system`](explain-output.md#jointype_system) and
  [`const`](explain-output.md#jointype_const) types, this is
  the best possible join type. It is used when all parts of
  an index are used by the join and the index is a
  `PRIMARY KEY` or `UNIQUE NOT
  NULL` index.

  [`eq_ref`](explain-output.md#jointype_eq_ref) can be used for
  indexed columns that are compared using the
  `=` operator. The comparison value can be
  a constant or an expression that uses columns from tables
  that are read before this table. In the following
  examples, MySQL can use an
  [`eq_ref`](explain-output.md#jointype_eq_ref) join to process
  *`ref_table`*:

  ```sql
  SELECT * FROM ref_table,other_table
    WHERE ref_table.key_column=other_table.column;

  SELECT * FROM ref_table,other_table
    WHERE ref_table.key_column_part1=other_table.column
    AND ref_table.key_column_part2=1;
  ```
- [`ref`](explain-output.md#jointype_ref)

  All rows with matching index values are read from this
  table for each combination of rows from the previous
  tables. [`ref`](explain-output.md#jointype_ref) is used if
  the join uses only a leftmost prefix of the key or if the
  key is not a `PRIMARY KEY` or
  `UNIQUE` index (in other words, if the
  join cannot select a single row based on the key value).
  If the key that is used matches only a few rows, this is a
  good join type.

  [`ref`](explain-output.md#jointype_ref) can be used for
  indexed columns that are compared using the
  `=` or `<=>`
  operator. In the following examples, MySQL can use a
  [`ref`](explain-output.md#jointype_ref) join to process
  *`ref_table`*:

  ```sql
  SELECT * FROM ref_table WHERE key_column=expr;

  SELECT * FROM ref_table,other_table
    WHERE ref_table.key_column=other_table.column;

  SELECT * FROM ref_table,other_table
    WHERE ref_table.key_column_part1=other_table.column
    AND ref_table.key_column_part2=1;
  ```
- [`fulltext`](explain-output.md#jointype_fulltext)

  The join is performed using a `FULLTEXT`
  index.
- [`ref_or_null`](explain-output.md#jointype_ref_or_null)

  This join type is like
  [`ref`](explain-output.md#jointype_ref), but with the
  addition that MySQL does an extra search for rows that
  contain `NULL` values. This join type
  optimization is used most often in resolving subqueries.
  In the following examples, MySQL can use a
  [`ref_or_null`](explain-output.md#jointype_ref_or_null) join to
  process *`ref_table`*:

  ```sql
  SELECT * FROM ref_table
    WHERE key_column=expr OR key_column IS NULL;
  ```

  See [Section 10.2.1.15, “IS NULL Optimization”](is-null-optimization.md "10.2.1.15 IS NULL Optimization").
- [`index_merge`](explain-output.md#jointype_index_merge)

  This join type indicates that the Index Merge optimization
  is used. In this case, the `key` column
  in the output row contains a list of indexes used, and
  `key_len` contains a list of the longest
  key parts for the indexes used. For more information, see
  [Section 10.2.1.3, “Index Merge Optimization”](index-merge-optimization.md "10.2.1.3 Index Merge Optimization").
- [`unique_subquery`](explain-output.md#jointype_unique_subquery)

  This type replaces
  [`eq_ref`](explain-output.md#jointype_eq_ref) for some
  `IN` subqueries of the following form:

  ```sql
  value IN (SELECT primary_key FROM single_table WHERE some_expr)
  ```

  [`unique_subquery`](explain-output.md#jointype_unique_subquery) is just
  an index lookup function that replaces the subquery
  completely for better efficiency.
- [`index_subquery`](explain-output.md#jointype_index_subquery)

  This join type is similar to
  [`unique_subquery`](explain-output.md#jointype_unique_subquery). It
  replaces `IN` subqueries, but it works
  for nonunique indexes in subqueries of the following form:

  ```sql
  value IN (SELECT key_column FROM single_table WHERE some_expr)
  ```
- [`range`](explain-output.md#jointype_range)

  Only rows that are in a given range are retrieved, using
  an index to select the rows. The `key`
  column in the output row indicates which index is used.
  The `key_len` contains the longest key
  part that was used. The `ref` column is
  `NULL` for this type.

  [`range`](explain-output.md#jointype_range) can be used when
  a key column is compared to a constant using any of the
  [`=`](comparison-operators.md#operator_equal),
  [`<>`](comparison-operators.md#operator_not-equal),
  [`>`](comparison-operators.md#operator_greater-than),
  [`>=`](comparison-operators.md#operator_greater-than-or-equal),
  [`<`](comparison-operators.md#operator_less-than),
  [`<=`](comparison-operators.md#operator_less-than-or-equal),
  [`IS NULL`](comparison-operators.md#operator_is-null),
  [`<=>`](comparison-operators.md#operator_equal-to),
  [`BETWEEN`](comparison-operators.md#operator_between),
  [`LIKE`](string-comparison-functions.md#operator_like), or
  [`IN()`](comparison-operators.md#operator_in) operators:

  ```sql
  SELECT * FROM tbl_name
    WHERE key_column = 10;

  SELECT * FROM tbl_name
    WHERE key_column BETWEEN 10 and 20;

  SELECT * FROM tbl_name
    WHERE key_column IN (10,20,30);

  SELECT * FROM tbl_name
    WHERE key_part1 = 10 AND key_part2 IN (10,20,30);
  ```
- [`index`](explain-output.md#jointype_index)

  The `index` join type is the same as
  [`ALL`](explain-output.md#jointype_all), except that the
  index tree is scanned. This occurs two ways:

  - If the index is a covering index for the queries and
    can be used to satisfy all data required from the
    table, only the index tree is scanned. In this case,
    the `Extra` column says
    `Using index`. An index-only scan
    usually is faster than
    [`ALL`](explain-output.md#jointype_all) because the
    size of the index usually is smaller than the table
    data.
  - A full table scan is performed using reads from the
    index to look up data rows in index order.
    `Uses index` does not appear in the
    `Extra` column.

  MySQL can use this join type when the query uses only
  columns that are part of a single index.
- [`ALL`](explain-output.md#jointype_all)

  A full table scan is done for each combination of rows
  from the previous tables. This is normally not good if the
  table is the first table not marked
  [`const`](explain-output.md#jointype_const), and usually
  *very* bad in all other cases.
  Normally, you can avoid
  [`ALL`](explain-output.md#jointype_all) by adding indexes
  that enable row retrieval from the table based on constant
  values or column values from earlier tables.

#### EXPLAIN Extra Information

The `Extra` column of
[`EXPLAIN`](explain.md "15.8.2 EXPLAIN Statement") output contains
additional information about how MySQL resolves the query. The
following list explains the values that can appear in this
column. Each item also indicates for JSON-formatted output
which property displays the `Extra` value.
For some of these, there is a specific property. The others
display as the text of the `message`
property.

If you want to make your queries as fast as possible, look out
for `Extra` column values of `Using
filesort` and `Using temporary`, or,
in JSON-formatted `EXPLAIN` output, for
`using_filesort` and
`using_temporary_table` properties equal to
`true`.

- `Backward index scan` (JSON:
  `backward_index_scan`)

  The optimizer is able to use a descending index on an
  `InnoDB` table. Shown together with
  `Using index`. For more information, see
  [Section 10.3.13, “Descending Indexes”](descending-indexes.md "10.3.13 Descending Indexes").
- `Child of 'table'
  pushed join@1` (JSON: `message`
  text)

  This table is referenced as the child of
  *`table`* in a join that can be
  pushed down to the NDB kernel. Applies only in NDB
  Cluster, when pushed-down joins are enabled. See the
  description of the
  [`ndb_join_pushdown`](mysql-cluster-options-variables.md#sysvar_ndb_join_pushdown) server
  system variable for more information and examples.
- `const row not found` (JSON property:
  `const_row_not_found`)

  For a query such as `SELECT ... FROM
  tbl_name`, the table
  was empty.
- `Deleting all rows` (JSON property:
  `message`)

  For [`DELETE`](delete.md "15.2.2 DELETE Statement"), some storage
  engines (such as [`MyISAM`](myisam-storage-engine.md "18.2 The MyISAM Storage Engine"))
  support a handler method that removes all table rows in a
  simple and fast way. This `Extra` value
  is displayed if the engine uses this optimization.
- `Distinct` (JSON property:
  `distinct`)

  MySQL is looking for distinct values, so it stops
  searching for more rows for the current row combination
  after it has found the first matching row.
- `FirstMatch(tbl_name)`
  (JSON property: `first_match`)

  The semijoin FirstMatch join shortcutting strategy is used
  for *`tbl_name`*.
- `Full scan on NULL key` (JSON property:
  `message`)

  This occurs for subquery optimization as a fallback
  strategy when the optimizer cannot use an index-lookup
  access method.
- `Impossible HAVING` (JSON property:
  `message`)

  The `HAVING` clause is always false and
  cannot select any rows.
- `Impossible WHERE` (JSON property:
  `message`)

  The `WHERE` clause is always false and
  cannot select any rows.
- `Impossible WHERE noticed after reading const
  tables` (JSON property:
  `message`)

  MySQL has read all
  [`const`](explain-output.md#jointype_const) (and
  [`system`](explain-output.md#jointype_system)) tables and
  notice that the `WHERE` clause is always
  false.
- `LooseScan(m..n)`
  (JSON property: `message`)

  The semijoin LooseScan strategy is used.
  *`m`* and
  *`n`* are key part numbers.
- `No matching min/max row` (JSON property:
  `message`)

  No row satisfies the condition for a query such as
  `SELECT MIN(...) FROM ... WHERE
  condition`.
- `no matching row in const table` (JSON
  property: `message`)

  For a query with a join, there was an empty table or a
  table with no rows satisfying a unique index condition.
- `No matching rows after partition
  pruning` (JSON property:
  `message`)

  For [`DELETE`](delete.md "15.2.2 DELETE Statement") or
  [`UPDATE`](update.md "15.2.17 UPDATE Statement"), the optimizer found
  nothing to delete or update after partition pruning. It is
  similar in meaning to `Impossible WHERE`
  for [`SELECT`](select.md "15.2.13 SELECT Statement") statements.
- `No tables used` (JSON property:
  `message`)

  The query has no `FROM` clause, or has a
  `FROM DUAL` clause.

  For [`INSERT`](insert.md "15.2.7 INSERT Statement") or
  [`REPLACE`](replace.md "15.2.12 REPLACE Statement") statements,
  [`EXPLAIN`](explain.md "15.8.2 EXPLAIN Statement") displays this value
  when there is no [`SELECT`](select.md "15.2.13 SELECT Statement")
  part. For example, it appears for `EXPLAIN INSERT
  INTO t VALUES(10)` because that is equivalent to
  `EXPLAIN INSERT INTO t SELECT 10 FROM
  DUAL`.
- `Not exists` (JSON property:
  `message`)

  MySQL was able to do a `LEFT JOIN`
  optimization on the query and does not examine more rows
  in this table for the previous row combination after it
  finds one row that matches the `LEFT
  JOIN` criteria. Here is an example of the type of
  query that can be optimized this way:

  ```sql
  SELECT * FROM t1 LEFT JOIN t2 ON t1.id=t2.id
    WHERE t2.id IS NULL;
  ```

  Assume that `t2.id` is defined as
  `NOT NULL`. In this case, MySQL scans
  `t1` and looks up the rows in
  `t2` using the values of
  `t1.id`. If MySQL finds a matching row in
  `t2`, it knows that
  `t2.id` can never be
  `NULL`, and does not scan through the
  rest of the rows in `t2` that have the
  same `id` value. In other words, for each
  row in `t1`, MySQL needs to do only a
  single lookup in `t2`, regardless of how
  many rows actually match in `t2`.

  In MySQL 8.0.17 and later, this can also indicate that a
  `WHERE` condition of the form
  `NOT IN
  (subquery)` or
  `NOT EXISTS
  (subquery)` has been
  transformed internally into an antijoin. This removes the
  subquery and brings its tables into the plan for the
  topmost query, providing improved cost planning. By
  merging semijoins and antijoins, the optimizer can reorder
  tables in the execution plan more freely, in some cases
  resulting in a faster plan.

  You can see when an antijoin transformation is performed
  for a given query by checking the
  `Message` column from `SHOW
  WARNINGS` following execution of
  `EXPLAIN`, or in the output of
  `EXPLAIN FORMAT=TREE`.

  Note

  An antijoin is the complement of a semijoin
  `table_a JOIN
  table_b ON
  condition`. The
  antijoin returns all rows from
  *`table_a`* for which there is
  *no* row in
  *`table_b`* which matches
  *`condition`*.
- `Plan isn't ready yet` (JSON property:
  none)

  This value occurs with [`EXPLAIN FOR
  CONNECTION`](explain-for-connection.md "10.8.4 Obtaining Execution Plan Information for a Named Connection") when the optimizer has not finished
  creating the execution plan for the statement executing in
  the named connection. If execution plan output comprises
  multiple lines, any or all of them could have this
  `Extra` value, depending on the progress
  of the optimizer in determining the full execution plan.
- `Range checked for each record (index map:
  N)` (JSON property:
  `message`)

  MySQL found no good index to use, but found that some of
  indexes might be used after column values from preceding
  tables are known. For each row combination in the
  preceding tables, MySQL checks whether it is possible to
  use a [`range`](explain-output.md#jointype_range) or
  [`index_merge`](explain-output.md#jointype_index_merge) access
  method to retrieve rows. This is not very fast, but is
  faster than performing a join with no index at all. The
  applicability criteria are as described in
  [Section 10.2.1.2, “Range Optimization”](range-optimization.md "10.2.1.2 Range Optimization"), and
  [Section 10.2.1.3, “Index Merge Optimization”](index-merge-optimization.md "10.2.1.3 Index Merge Optimization"), with the
  exception that all column values for the preceding table
  are known and considered to be constants.

  Indexes are numbered beginning with 1, in the same order
  as shown by [`SHOW INDEX`](show-index.md "15.7.7.22 SHOW INDEX Statement") for
  the table. The index map value
  *`N`* is a bitmask value that
  indicates which indexes are candidates. For example, a
  value of `0x19` (binary 11001) means that
  indexes 1, 4, and 5 are considered.
- `Recursive` (JSON property:
  `recursive`)

  This indicates that the row applies to the recursive
  [`SELECT`](select.md "15.2.13 SELECT Statement") part of a recursive
  common table expression. See [Section 15.2.20, “WITH (Common Table Expressions)”](with.md "15.2.20 WITH (Common Table Expressions)").
- `Rematerialize` (JSON property:
  `rematerialize`)

  `Rematerialize (X,...)` is displayed in
  the `EXPLAIN` row for table
  `T`, where `X` is any
  lateral derived table whose rematerialization is triggered
  when a new row of `T` is read. For
  example:

  ```sql
  SELECT
    ...
  FROM
    t,
    LATERAL (derived table that refers to t) AS dt
  ...
  ```

  The content of the derived table is rematerialized to
  bring it up to date each time a new row of
  `t` is processed by the top query.
- `Scanned N
  databases` (JSON property:
  `message`)

  This indicates how many directory scans the server
  performs when processing a query for
  `INFORMATION_SCHEMA` tables, as described
  in [Section 10.2.3, “Optimizing INFORMATION\_SCHEMA Queries”](information-schema-optimization.md "10.2.3 Optimizing INFORMATION_SCHEMA Queries"). The
  value of *`N`* can be 0, 1, or
  `all`.
- `Select tables optimized away` (JSON
  property: `message`)

  The optimizer determined 1) that at most one row should be
  returned, and 2) that to produce this row, a deterministic
  set of rows must be read. When the rows to be read can be
  read during the optimization phase (for example, by
  reading index rows), there is no need to read any tables
  during query execution.

  The first condition is fulfilled when the query is
  implicitly grouped (contains an aggregate function but no
  `GROUP BY` clause). The second condition
  is fulfilled when one row lookup is performed per index
  used. The number of indexes read determines the number of
  rows to read.

  Consider the following implicitly grouped query:

  ```sql
  SELECT MIN(c1), MIN(c2) FROM t1;
  ```

  Suppose that `MIN(c1)` can be retrieved
  by reading one index row and `MIN(c2)`
  can be retrieved by reading one row from a different
  index. That is, for each column `c1` and
  `c2`, there exists an index where the
  column is the first column of the index. In this case, one
  row is returned, produced by reading two deterministic
  rows.

  This `Extra` value does not occur if the
  rows to read are not deterministic. Consider this query:

  ```sql
  SELECT MIN(c2) FROM t1 WHERE c1 <= 10;
  ```

  Suppose that `(c1, c2)` is a covering
  index. Using this index, all rows with `c1 <=
  10` must be scanned to find the minimum
  `c2` value. By contrast, consider this
  query:

  ```sql
  SELECT MIN(c2) FROM t1 WHERE c1 = 10;
  ```

  In this case, the first index row with `c1 =
  10` contains the minimum `c2`
  value. Only one row must be read to produce the returned
  row.

  For storage engines that maintain an exact row count per
  table (such as `MyISAM`, but not
  `InnoDB`), this `Extra`
  value can occur for `COUNT(*)` queries
  for which the `WHERE` clause is missing
  or always true and there is no `GROUP BY`
  clause. (This is an instance of an implicitly grouped
  query where the storage engine influences whether a
  deterministic number of rows can be read.)
- `Skip_open_table`,
  `Open_frm_only`,
  `Open_full_table` (JSON property:
  `message`)

  These values indicate file-opening optimizations that
  apply to queries for `INFORMATION_SCHEMA`
  tables.

  - `Skip_open_table`: Table files do not
    need to be opened. The information is already
    available from the data dictionary.
  - `Open_frm_only`: Only the data
    dictionary need be read for table information.
  - `Open_full_table`: Unoptimized
    information lookup. Table information must be read
    from the data dictionary and by reading table files.
- `Start temporary`, `End
  temporary` (JSON property:
  `message`)

  This indicates temporary table use for the semijoin
  Duplicate Weedout strategy.
- `unique row not found` (JSON property:
  `message`)

  For a query such as `SELECT ... FROM
  tbl_name`, no rows
  satisfy the condition for a `UNIQUE`
  index or `PRIMARY KEY` on the table.
- `Using filesort` (JSON property:
  `using_filesort`)

  MySQL must do an extra pass to find out how to retrieve
  the rows in sorted order. The sort is done by going
  through all rows according to the join type and storing
  the sort key and pointer to the row for all rows that
  match the `WHERE` clause. The keys then
  are sorted and the rows are retrieved in sorted order. See
  [Section 10.2.1.16, “ORDER BY Optimization”](order-by-optimization.md "10.2.1.16 ORDER BY Optimization").
- `Using index` (JSON property:
  `using_index`)

  The column information is retrieved from the table using
  only information in the index tree without having to do an
  additional seek to read the actual row. This strategy can
  be used when the query uses only columns that are part of
  a single index.

  For `InnoDB` tables that have a
  user-defined clustered index, that index can be used even
  when `Using index` is absent from the
  `Extra` column. This is the case if
  `type` is
  [`index`](explain-output.md#jointype_index) and
  `key` is `PRIMARY`.

  Information about any covering indexes used is shown for
  `EXPLAIN FORMAT=TRADITIONAL` and
  `EXPLAIN FORMAT=JSON`. Beginning with
  MySQL 8.0.27, it is also shown for `EXPLAIN
  FORMAT=TREE`.
- `Using index condition` (JSON property:
  `using_index_condition`)

  Tables are read by accessing index tuples and testing them
  first to determine whether to read full table rows. In
  this way, index information is used to defer (“push
  down”) reading full table rows unless it is
  necessary. See
  [Section 10.2.1.6, “Index Condition Pushdown Optimization”](index-condition-pushdown-optimization.md "10.2.1.6 Index Condition Pushdown Optimization").
- `Using index for group-by` (JSON
  property: `using_index_for_group_by`)

  Similar to the `Using index` table access
  method, `Using index for group-by`
  indicates that MySQL found an index that can be used to
  retrieve all columns of a `GROUP BY` or
  `DISTINCT` query without any extra disk
  access to the actual table. Additionally, the index is
  used in the most efficient way so that for each group,
  only a few index entries are read. For details, see
  [Section 10.2.1.17, “GROUP BY Optimization”](group-by-optimization.md "10.2.1.17 GROUP BY Optimization").
- `Using index for skip scan` (JSON
  property: `using_index_for_skip_scan`)

  Indicates that the Skip Scan access method is used. See
  [Skip Scan Range Access Method](range-optimization.md#range-access-skip-scan "Skip Scan Range Access Method").
- `Using join buffer (Block Nested Loop)`,
  `Using join buffer (Batched Key Access)`,
  `Using join buffer (hash join)` (JSON
  property: `using_join_buffer`)

  Tables from earlier joins are read in portions into the
  join buffer, and then their rows are used from the buffer
  to perform the join with the current table.
  `(Block Nested Loop)` indicates use of
  the Block Nested-Loop algorithm, `(Batched Key
  Access)` indicates use of the Batched Key Access
  algorithm, and `(hash join)` indicates
  use of a hash join. That is, the keys from the table on
  the preceding line of the
  [`EXPLAIN`](explain.md "15.8.2 EXPLAIN Statement") output are
  buffered, and the matching rows are fetched in batches
  from the table represented by the line in which
  `Using join buffer` appears.

  In JSON-formatted output, the value of
  `using_join_buffer` is always one of
  `Block Nested Loop`, `Batched Key
  Access`, or `hash join`.

  Hash joins are available beginning with MySQL 8.0.18; the
  Block Nested-Loop algorithm is not used in MySQL 8.0.20 or
  later MySQL releases. For more information about these
  optimizations, see [Section 10.2.1.4, “Hash Join Optimization”](hash-joins.md "10.2.1.4 Hash Join Optimization"), and
  [Block Nested-Loop Join Algorithm](nested-loop-joins.md#block-nested-loop-join-algorithm "Block Nested-Loop Join Algorithm").

  See [Batched Key Access Joins](bnl-bka-optimization.md#bka-optimization "Batched Key Access Joins"), for information
  about the Batched Key Access algorithm.
- `Using MRR` (JSON property:
  `message`)

  Tables are read using the Multi-Range Read optimization
  strategy. See [Section 10.2.1.11, “Multi-Range Read Optimization”](mrr-optimization.md "10.2.1.11 Multi-Range Read Optimization").
- `Using sort_union(...)`, `Using
  union(...)`, `Using
  intersect(...)` (JSON property:
  `message`)

  These indicate the particular algorithm showing how index
  scans are merged for the
  [`index_merge`](explain-output.md#jointype_index_merge) join type.
  See [Section 10.2.1.3, “Index Merge Optimization”](index-merge-optimization.md "10.2.1.3 Index Merge Optimization").
- `Using temporary` (JSON property:
  `using_temporary_table`)

  To resolve the query, MySQL needs to create a temporary
  table to hold the result. This typically happens if the
  query contains `GROUP BY` and
  `ORDER BY` clauses that list columns
  differently.
- `Using where` (JSON property:
  `attached_condition`)

  A `WHERE` clause is used to restrict
  which rows to match against the next table or send to the
  client. Unless you specifically intend to fetch or examine
  all rows from the table, you may have something wrong in
  your query if the `Extra` value is not
  `Using where` and the table join type is
  [`ALL`](explain-output.md#jointype_all) or
  [`index`](explain-output.md#jointype_index).

  `Using where` has no direct counterpart
  in JSON-formatted output; the
  `attached_condition` property contains
  any `WHERE` condition used.
- `Using where with pushed condition` (JSON
  property: `message`)

  This item applies to [`NDB`](mysql-cluster.md "Chapter 25 MySQL NDB Cluster 8.0")
  tables *only*. It means that NDB
  Cluster is using the Condition Pushdown optimization to
  improve the efficiency of a direct comparison between a
  nonindexed column and a constant. In such cases, the
  condition is “pushed down” to the
  cluster's data nodes and is evaluated on all data
  nodes simultaneously. This eliminates the need to send
  nonmatching rows over the network, and can speed up such
  queries by a factor of 5 to 10 times over cases where
  Condition Pushdown could be but is not used. For more
  information, see
  [Section 10.2.1.5, “Engine Condition Pushdown Optimization”](engine-condition-pushdown-optimization.md "10.2.1.5 Engine Condition Pushdown Optimization").
- `Zero limit` (JSON property:
  `message`)

  The query had a `LIMIT 0` clause and
  cannot select any rows.

#### EXPLAIN Output Interpretation

You can get a good indication of how good a join is by taking
the product of the values in the `rows`
column of the [`EXPLAIN`](explain.md "15.8.2 EXPLAIN Statement") output.
This should tell you roughly how many rows MySQL must examine
to execute the query. If you restrict queries with the
[`max_join_size`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_max_join_size) system
variable, this row product also is used to determine which
multiple-table [`SELECT`](select.md "15.2.13 SELECT Statement")
statements to execute and which to abort. See
[Section 7.1.1, “Configuring the Server”](server-configuration.md "7.1.1 Configuring the Server").

The following example shows how a multiple-table join can be
optimized progressively based on the information provided by
[`EXPLAIN`](explain.md "15.8.2 EXPLAIN Statement").

Suppose that you have the
[`SELECT`](select.md "15.2.13 SELECT Statement") statement shown here and
that you plan to examine it using
[`EXPLAIN`](explain.md "15.8.2 EXPLAIN Statement"):

```sql
EXPLAIN SELECT tt.TicketNumber, tt.TimeIn,
               tt.ProjectReference, tt.EstimatedShipDate,
               tt.ActualShipDate, tt.ClientID,
               tt.ServiceCodes, tt.RepetitiveID,
               tt.CurrentProcess, tt.CurrentDPPerson,
               tt.RecordVolume, tt.DPPrinted, et.COUNTRY,
               et_1.COUNTRY, do.CUSTNAME
        FROM tt, et, et AS et_1, do
        WHERE tt.SubmitTime IS NULL
          AND tt.ActualPC = et.EMPLOYID
          AND tt.AssignedPC = et_1.EMPLOYID
          AND tt.ClientID = do.CUSTNMBR;
```

For this example, make the following assumptions:

- The columns being compared have been declared as follows.

  | Table | Column | Data Type |
  | --- | --- | --- |
  | `tt` | `ActualPC` | `CHAR(10)` |
  | `tt` | `AssignedPC` | `CHAR(10)` |
  | `tt` | `ClientID` | `CHAR(10)` |
  | `et` | `EMPLOYID` | `CHAR(15)` |
  | `do` | `CUSTNMBR` | `CHAR(15)` |
- The tables have the following indexes.

  | Table | Index |
  | --- | --- |
  | `tt` | `ActualPC` |
  | `tt` | `AssignedPC` |
  | `tt` | `ClientID` |
  | `et` | `EMPLOYID` (primary key) |
  | `do` | `CUSTNMBR` (primary key) |
- The `tt.ActualPC` values are not evenly
  distributed.

Initially, before any optimizations have been performed, the
[`EXPLAIN`](explain.md "15.8.2 EXPLAIN Statement") statement produces the
following information:

```none
table type possible_keys key  key_len ref  rows  Extra
et    ALL  PRIMARY       NULL NULL    NULL 74
do    ALL  PRIMARY       NULL NULL    NULL 2135
et_1  ALL  PRIMARY       NULL NULL    NULL 74
tt    ALL  AssignedPC,   NULL NULL    NULL 3872
           ClientID,
           ActualPC
      Range checked for each record (index map: 0x23)
```

Because `type` is
[`ALL`](explain-output.md#jointype_all) for each table, this
output indicates that MySQL is generating a Cartesian product
of all the tables; that is, every combination of rows. This
takes quite a long time, because the product of the number of
rows in each table must be examined. For the case at hand,
this product is 74 × 2135 × 74 × 3872 =
45,268,558,720 rows. If the tables were bigger, you can only
imagine how long it would take.

One problem here is that MySQL can use indexes on columns more
efficiently if they are declared as the same type and size. In
this context, [`VARCHAR`](char.md "13.3.2 The CHAR and VARCHAR Types") and
[`CHAR`](char.md "13.3.2 The CHAR and VARCHAR Types") are considered the same if
they are declared as the same size.
`tt.ActualPC` is declared as
`CHAR(10)` and `et.EMPLOYID`
is `CHAR(15)`, so there is a length mismatch.

To fix this disparity between column lengths, use
[`ALTER TABLE`](alter-table.md "15.1.9 ALTER TABLE Statement") to lengthen
`ActualPC` from 10 characters to 15
characters:

```sql
mysql> ALTER TABLE tt MODIFY ActualPC VARCHAR(15);
```

Now `tt.ActualPC` and
`et.EMPLOYID` are both
`VARCHAR(15)`. Executing the
[`EXPLAIN`](explain.md "15.8.2 EXPLAIN Statement") statement again
produces this result:

```none
table type   possible_keys key     key_len ref         rows    Extra
tt    ALL    AssignedPC,   NULL    NULL    NULL        3872    Using
             ClientID,                                         where
             ActualPC
do    ALL    PRIMARY       NULL    NULL    NULL        2135
      Range checked for each record (index map: 0x1)
et_1  ALL    PRIMARY       NULL    NULL    NULL        74
      Range checked for each record (index map: 0x1)
et    eq_ref PRIMARY       PRIMARY 15      tt.ActualPC 1
```

This is not perfect, but is much better: The product of the
`rows` values is less by a factor of 74. This
version executes in a couple of seconds.

A second alteration can be made to eliminate the column length
mismatches for the `tt.AssignedPC =
et_1.EMPLOYID` and `tt.ClientID =
do.CUSTNMBR` comparisons:

```sql
mysql> ALTER TABLE tt MODIFY AssignedPC VARCHAR(15),
                      MODIFY ClientID   VARCHAR(15);
```

After that modification,
[`EXPLAIN`](explain.md "15.8.2 EXPLAIN Statement") produces the output
shown here:

```none
table type   possible_keys key      key_len ref           rows Extra
et    ALL    PRIMARY       NULL     NULL    NULL          74
tt    ref    AssignedPC,   ActualPC 15      et.EMPLOYID   52   Using
             ClientID,                                         where
             ActualPC
et_1  eq_ref PRIMARY       PRIMARY  15      tt.AssignedPC 1
do    eq_ref PRIMARY       PRIMARY  15      tt.ClientID   1
```

At this point, the query is optimized almost as well as
possible. The remaining problem is that, by default, MySQL
assumes that values in the `tt.ActualPC`
column are evenly distributed, and that is not the case for
the `tt` table. Fortunately, it is easy to
tell MySQL to analyze the key distribution:

```sql
mysql> ANALYZE TABLE tt;
```

With the additional index information, the join is perfect and
[`EXPLAIN`](explain.md "15.8.2 EXPLAIN Statement") produces this result:

```none
table type   possible_keys key     key_len ref           rows Extra
tt    ALL    AssignedPC    NULL    NULL    NULL          3872 Using
             ClientID,                                        where
             ActualPC
et    eq_ref PRIMARY       PRIMARY 15      tt.ActualPC   1
et_1  eq_ref PRIMARY       PRIMARY 15      tt.AssignedPC 1
do    eq_ref PRIMARY       PRIMARY 15      tt.ClientID   1
```

The `rows` column in the output from
[`EXPLAIN`](explain.md "15.8.2 EXPLAIN Statement") is an educated guess
from the MySQL join optimizer. Check whether the numbers are
even close to the truth by comparing the
`rows` product with the actual number of rows
that the query returns. If the numbers are quite different,
you might get better performance by using
`STRAIGHT_JOIN` in your
[`SELECT`](select.md "15.2.13 SELECT Statement") statement and trying to
list the tables in a different order in the
`FROM` clause. (However,
`STRAIGHT_JOIN` may prevent indexes from
being used because it disables semijoin transformations. See
[Section 10.2.2.1, “Optimizing IN and EXISTS Subquery Predicates with Semijoin
Transformations”](semijoins.md "10.2.2.1 Optimizing IN and EXISTS Subquery Predicates with Semijoin Transformations").)

It is possible in some cases to execute statements that modify
data when [`EXPLAIN
SELECT`](explain.md "15.8.2 EXPLAIN Statement") is used with a subquery; for more
information, see [Section 15.2.15.8, “Derived Tables”](derived-tables.md "15.2.15.8 Derived Tables").
