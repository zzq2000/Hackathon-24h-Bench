#### 15.2.7.1 INSERT ... SELECT Statement

```sql
INSERT [LOW_PRIORITY | HIGH_PRIORITY] [IGNORE]
    [INTO] tbl_name
    [PARTITION (partition_name [, partition_name] ...)]
    [(col_name [, col_name] ...)]
    {   SELECT ...
      | TABLE table_name
      | VALUES row_constructor_list
    }
    [ON DUPLICATE KEY UPDATE assignment_list]

value:
    {expr | DEFAULT}

value_list:
    value [, value] ...

row_constructor_list:
    ROW(value_list)[, ROW(value_list)][, ...]

assignment:
    col_name =
          value
        | [row_alias.]col_name
        | [tbl_name.]col_name
        | [row_alias.]col_alias

assignment_list:
    assignment [, assignment] ...
```

With [`INSERT ...
SELECT`](insert-select.md "15.2.7.1 INSERT ... SELECT Statement"), you can quickly insert many rows into a table
from the result of a [`SELECT`](select.md "15.2.13 SELECT Statement")
statement, which can select from one or many tables. For
example:

```sql
INSERT INTO tbl_temp2 (fld_id)
  SELECT tbl_temp1.fld_order_id
  FROM tbl_temp1 WHERE tbl_temp1.fld_order_id > 100;
```

Beginning with MySQL 8.0.19, you can use a
[`TABLE`](table.md "15.2.16 TABLE Statement") statement in place of
[`SELECT`](select.md "15.2.13 SELECT Statement"), as shown here:

```sql
INSERT INTO ta TABLE tb;
```

`TABLE tb` is equivalent to `SELECT *
FROM tb`. It can be useful when inserting all columns
from the source table into the target table, and no filtering
with WHERE is required. In addition, the rows from
[`TABLE`](table.md "15.2.16 TABLE Statement") can be ordered by one or
more columns using `ORDER BY`, and the number
of rows inserted can be limited using a `LIMIT`
clause. For more information, see [Section 15.2.16, “TABLE Statement”](table.md "15.2.16 TABLE Statement").

The following conditions hold for
[`INSERT ...
SELECT`](insert-select.md "15.2.7.1 INSERT ... SELECT Statement") statements, and, except where noted, for
`INSERT ... TABLE` as well:

- Specify `IGNORE` to ignore rows that would
  cause duplicate-key violations.
- The target table of the
  [`INSERT`](insert.md "15.2.7 INSERT Statement") statement may appear
  in the `FROM` clause of the
  [`SELECT`](select.md "15.2.13 SELECT Statement") part of the query, or
  as the table named by [`TABLE`](table.md "15.2.16 TABLE Statement").
  However, you cannot insert into a table and select from the
  same table in a subquery.

  When selecting from and inserting into the same table, MySQL
  creates an internal temporary table to hold the rows from
  the [`SELECT`](select.md "15.2.13 SELECT Statement") and then inserts
  those rows into the target table. However, you cannot use
  `INSERT INTO t ... SELECT ... FROM t` when
  `t` is a `TEMPORARY`
  table, because `TEMPORARY` tables cannot be
  referred to twice in the same statement. For the same
  reason, you cannot use `INSERT INTO t ... TABLE
  t` when `t` is a temporary table.
  See [Section 10.4.4, “Internal Temporary Table Use in MySQL”](internal-temporary-tables.md "10.4.4 Internal Temporary Table Use in MySQL"), and
  [Section B.3.6.2, “TEMPORARY Table Problems”](temporary-table-problems.md "B.3.6.2 TEMPORARY Table Problems").
- `AUTO_INCREMENT` columns work as usual.
- To ensure that the binary log can be used to re-create the
  original tables, MySQL does not permit concurrent inserts
  for [`INSERT
  ... SELECT`](insert-select.md "15.2.7.1 INSERT ... SELECT Statement") or `INSERT ... TABLE`
  statements (see [Section 10.11.3, “Concurrent Inserts”](concurrent-inserts.md "10.11.3 Concurrent Inserts")).
- To avoid ambiguous column reference problems when the
  [`SELECT`](select.md "15.2.13 SELECT Statement") and the
  [`INSERT`](insert.md "15.2.7 INSERT Statement") refer to the same
  table, provide a unique alias for each table used in the
  [`SELECT`](select.md "15.2.13 SELECT Statement") part, and qualify
  column names in that part with the appropriate alias.

  The [`TABLE`](table.md "15.2.16 TABLE Statement") statement does not
  support aliases.

You can explicitly select which partitions or subpartitions (or
both) of the source or target table (or both) are to be used
with a `PARTITION` clause following the name of
the table. When `PARTITION` is used with the
name of the source table in the
[`SELECT`](select.md "15.2.13 SELECT Statement") portion of the statement,
rows are selected only from the partitions or subpartitions
named in its partition list. When `PARTITION`
is used with the name of the target table for the
[`INSERT`](insert.md "15.2.7 INSERT Statement") portion of the statement,
it must be possible to insert all rows selected into the
partitions or subpartitions named in the partition list
following the option. Otherwise, the `INSERT ...
SELECT` statement fails. For more information and
examples, see [Section 26.5, “Partition Selection”](partitioning-selection.md "26.5 Partition Selection").

[`TABLE`](table.md "15.2.16 TABLE Statement") does not support a
`PARTITION` clause.

For [`INSERT
... SELECT`](insert-on-duplicate.md "15.2.7.2 INSERT ... ON DUPLICATE KEY UPDATE Statement") statements, see
[Section 15.2.7.2, “INSERT ... ON DUPLICATE KEY UPDATE Statement”](insert-on-duplicate.md "15.2.7.2 INSERT ... ON DUPLICATE KEY UPDATE Statement") for conditions under which
the [`SELECT`](select.md "15.2.13 SELECT Statement") columns can be
referred to in an `ON DUPLICATE KEY UPDATE`
clause. This also works for `INSERT ... TABLE`.

The order in which a [`SELECT`](select.md "15.2.13 SELECT Statement") or
[`TABLE`](table.md "15.2.16 TABLE Statement") statement with no
`ORDER BY` clause returns rows is
nondeterministic. This means that, when using replication, there
is no guarantee that such a
[`SELECT`](select.md "15.2.13 SELECT Statement") returns rows in the same
order on the source and the replica, which can lead to
inconsistencies between them. To prevent this from occurring,
always write `INSERT ... SELECT` or
`INSERT ... TABLE` statements that are to be
replicated using an `ORDER BY` clause that
produces the same row order on the source and the replica. See
also [Section 19.5.1.18, “Replication and LIMIT”](replication-features-limit.md "19.5.1.18 Replication and LIMIT").

Due to this issue,
[`INSERT ...
SELECT ON DUPLICATE KEY UPDATE`](insert-on-duplicate.md "15.2.7.2 INSERT ... ON DUPLICATE KEY UPDATE Statement") and
[`INSERT IGNORE ...
SELECT`](insert-select.md "15.2.7.1 INSERT ... SELECT Statement") statements are flagged as unsafe for
statement-based replication. Such statements produce a warning
in the error log when using statement-based mode and are written
to the binary log using the row-based format when using
`MIXED` mode. (Bug #11758262, Bug #50439)

Replication”](replication-sbr-rbr.md "19.2.1.1 Advantages and Disadvantages of Statement-Based and Row-Based Replication").
