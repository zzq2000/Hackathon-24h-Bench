#### 7.6.7.4 Cloning and Concurrent DDL

Prior to MySQL 8.0.27, DDL operations on the donor and recipient
MySQL Server instances, including [`TRUNCATE
TABLE`](truncate-table.md "15.1.37 TRUNCATE TABLE Statement"), are not permitted during a cloning operation.
This limitation should be considered when selecting data
sources. A workaround is to use dedicated donor instances, which
can accommodate DDL operations being blocked while data is
cloned.

To prevent concurrent DDL during a cloning operation, an
exclusive backup lock is acquired on the donor and recipient.
The [`clone_ddl_timeout`](clone-plugin-options-variables.md#sysvar_clone_ddl_timeout) variable
defines the time in seconds on the donor and recipient that a
cloning operation waits for a backup lock. The default setting
is 300 seconds. If a backup lock is not obtained with the
specified time limit, the cloning operation fails with an error.

From MySQL 8.0.27, concurrent DDL is permitted on the donor by
default. Concurrent DDL support on the donor is controlled by
the [`clone_block_ddl`](clone-plugin-options-variables.md#sysvar_clone_block_ddl) variable.
Concurrent DDL support can be enabled and disabled dynamically
using a [`SET`](set.md "13.3.6 The SET Type") statement.

```sql
SET GLOBAL clone_block_ddl={OFF|ON}
```

The default setting is
[`clone_block_ddl=OFF`](clone-plugin-options-variables.md#sysvar_clone_block_ddl), which
permits concurrent DDL on the donor.

Whether the effect of a concurrent DDL operation is cloned or
not depends on whether the DDL operation finishes before the
dynamic snapshot is taken by the cloning operation.

DDL operations that are not permitted during a cloning operation
regardless of the
[`clone_block_ddl`](clone-plugin-options-variables.md#sysvar_clone_block_ddl) setting
include:

- `ALTER TABLE tbl_name
  DISCARD TABLESPACE;`
- `ALTER TABLE tbl_name
  IMPORT TABLESPACE;`
- `ALTER INSTANCE DISABLE INNODB REDO_LOG;`
