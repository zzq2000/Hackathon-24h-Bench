### 8.2.21 Setting Account Resource Limits

One means of restricting client use of MySQL server resources is
to set the global
[`max_user_connections`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_max_user_connections) system
variable to a nonzero value. This limits the number of
simultaneous connections that can be made by any given account,
but places no limits on what a client can do once connected. In
addition, setting
[`max_user_connections`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_max_user_connections) does not
enable management of individual accounts. Both types of control
are of interest to MySQL administrators.

To address such concerns, MySQL permits limits for individual
accounts on use of these server resources:

- The number of queries an account can issue per hour
- The number of updates an account can issue per hour
- The number of times an account can connect to the server per
  hour
- The number of simultaneous connections to the server by an
  account

Any statement that a client can issue counts against the query
limit. Only statements that modify databases or tables count
against the update limit.

An “account” in this context corresponds to a row in
the `mysql.user` system table. That is, a
connection is assessed against the `User` and
`Host` values in the `user`
table row that applies to the connection. For example, an account
`'usera'@'%.example.com'` corresponds to a row in
the `user` table that has `User`
and `Host` values of `usera` and
`%.example.com`, to permit
`usera` to connect from any host in the
`example.com` domain. In this case, the server
applies resource limits in this row collectively to all
connections by `usera` from any host in the
`example.com` domain because all such connections
use the same account.

Before MySQL 5.0, an “account” was assessed against
the actual host from which a user connects. This older method of
accounting may be selected by starting the server with the
[`--old-style-user-limits`](server-options.md#option_mysqld_old-style-user-limits) option. In
this case, if `usera` connects simultaneously
from `host1.example.com` and
`host2.example.com`, the server applies the
account resource limits separately to each connection. If
`usera` connects again from
`host1.example.com`, the server applies the
limits for that connection together with the existing connection
from that host.

Note

The [`--old-style-user-limits`](server-options.md#option_mysqld_old-style-user-limits)
option is deprecated in MySQL 8.0.30, and is subject to removal
in a future release of MySQL. Use of this option on the command
line or in an option file in MySQL 8.0.30 or later causes the
server to raise a warning.

To establish resource limits for an account at account-creation
time, use the [`CREATE USER`](create-user.md "15.7.1.3 CREATE USER Statement")
statement. To modify the limits for an existing account, use
[`ALTER USER`](alter-user.md "15.7.1.1 ALTER USER Statement"). Provide a
`WITH` clause that names each resource to be
limited. The default value for each limit is zero (no limit). For
example, to create a new account that can access the
`customer` database, but only in a limited
fashion, issue these statements:

```sql
mysql> CREATE USER 'francis'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'frank'
    ->     WITH MAX_QUERIES_PER_HOUR 20
    ->          MAX_UPDATES_PER_HOUR 10
    ->          MAX_CONNECTIONS_PER_HOUR 5
    ->          MAX_USER_CONNECTIONS 2;
```

The limit types need not all be named in the
`WITH` clause, but those named can be present in
any order. The value for each per-hour limit should be an integer
representing a count per hour. For
`MAX_USER_CONNECTIONS`, the limit is an integer
representing the maximum number of simultaneous connections by the
account. If this limit is set to zero, the global
[`max_user_connections`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_max_user_connections) system
variable value determines the number of simultaneous connections.
If [`max_user_connections`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_max_user_connections) is also
zero, there is no limit for the account.

To modify limits for an existing account, use an
[`ALTER USER`](alter-user.md "15.7.1.1 ALTER USER Statement") statement. The following
statement changes the query limit for `francis`
to 100:

```sql
mysql> ALTER USER 'francis'@'localhost' WITH MAX_QUERIES_PER_HOUR 100;
```

The statement modifies only the limit value specified and leaves
the account otherwise unchanged.

To remove a limit, set its value to zero. For example, to remove
the limit on how many times per hour `francis`
can connect, use this statement:

```sql
mysql> ALTER USER 'francis'@'localhost' WITH MAX_CONNECTIONS_PER_HOUR 0;
```

As mentioned previously, the simultaneous-connection limit for an
account is determined from the
`MAX_USER_CONNECTIONS` limit and the
[`max_user_connections`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_max_user_connections) system
variable. Suppose that the global
[`max_user_connections`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_max_user_connections) value is 10
and three accounts have individual resource limits specified as
follows:

```sql
ALTER USER 'user1'@'localhost' WITH MAX_USER_CONNECTIONS 0;
ALTER USER 'user2'@'localhost' WITH MAX_USER_CONNECTIONS 5;
ALTER USER 'user3'@'localhost' WITH MAX_USER_CONNECTIONS 20;
```

`user1` has a connection limit of 10 (the global
[`max_user_connections`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_max_user_connections) value)
because it has a `MAX_USER_CONNECTIONS` limit of
zero. `user2` and `user3` have
connection limits of 5 and 20, respectively, because they have
nonzero `MAX_USER_CONNECTIONS` limits.

The server stores resource limits for an account in the
`user` table row corresponding to the account.
The `max_questions`,
`max_updates`, and
`max_connections` columns store the per-hour
limits, and the `max_user_connections` column
stores the `MAX_USER_CONNECTIONS` limit. (See
[Section 8.2.3, “Grant Tables”](grant-tables.md "8.2.3 Grant Tables").)

Resource-use counting takes place when any account has a nonzero
limit placed on its use of any of the resources.

As the server runs, it counts the number of times each account
uses resources. If an account reaches its limit on number of
connections within the last hour, the server rejects further
connections for the account until that hour is up. Similarly, if
the account reaches its limit on the number of queries or updates,
the server rejects further queries or updates until the hour is
up. In all such cases, the server issues appropriate error
messages.

Resource counting occurs per account, not per client. For example,
if your account has a query limit of 50, you cannot increase your
limit to 100 by making two simultaneous client connections to the
server. Queries issued on both connections are counted together.

The current per-hour resource-use counts can be reset globally for
all accounts, or individually for a given account:

- To reset the current counts to zero for all accounts, issue a
  [`FLUSH USER_RESOURCES`](flush.md#flush-user-resources) statement.
  The counts also can be reset by reloading the grant tables
  (for example, with a [`FLUSH
  PRIVILEGES`](flush.md#flush-privileges) statement or a [**mysqladmin
  reload**](mysqladmin.md "6.5.2 mysqladmin — A MySQL Server Administration Program") command).
- The counts for an individual account can be reset to zero by
  setting any of its limits again. Specify a limit value equal
  to the value currently assigned to the account.

Per-hour counter resets do not affect the
`MAX_USER_CONNECTIONS` limit.

All counts begin at zero when the server starts. Counts do not
carry over through server restarts.

For the `MAX_USER_CONNECTIONS` limit, an edge
case can occur if the account currently has open the maximum
number of connections permitted to it: A disconnect followed
quickly by a connect can result in an error
([`ER_TOO_MANY_USER_CONNECTIONS`](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/mysql-errors/8.0/en/server-error-reference.html#error_er_too_many_user_connections) or
[`ER_USER_LIMIT_REACHED`](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/mysql-errors/8.0/en/server-error-reference.html#error_er_user_limit_reached)) if the
server has not fully processed the disconnect by the time the
connect occurs. When the server finishes disconnect processing,
another connection is once more permitted.
