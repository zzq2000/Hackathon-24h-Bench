#### 20.7.9.2 Example Queries

This section describes sample queries using the instruments and
events for monitoring Group Replication memory usage. The
queries retrieve data from the
[`memory_summary_global_by_event_name`](performance-schema-memory-summary-tables.md "29.12.20.10 Memory Summary Tables")
table.

The memory data can be queried for individual events, for
example:

```sql
SELECT * FROM performance_schema.memory_summary_global_by_event_name
WHERE EVENT_NAME = 'memory/group_rpl/write_set_encoded'\G

*************************** 1. row ***************************
                  EVENT_NAME: memory/group_rpl/write_set_encoded
                 COUNT_ALLOC: 1
                  COUNT_FREE: 0
   SUM_NUMBER_OF_BYTES_ALLOC: 45
    SUM_NUMBER_OF_BYTES_FREE: 0
              LOW_COUNT_USED: 0
          CURRENT_COUNT_USED: 1
             HIGH_COUNT_USED: 1
    LOW_NUMBER_OF_BYTES_USED: 0
CURRENT_NUMBER_OF_BYTES_USED: 45
   HIGH_NUMBER_OF_BYTES_USED: 45
```

See [Section 29.12.20.10, “Memory Summary Tables”](performance-schema-memory-summary-tables.md "29.12.20.10 Memory Summary Tables")
for more information on the columns.

You can also define queries which sum various events to provide
overviews of specific areas of memory usage.

##### Memory Used in Delivery Message Service

Note

This instrumentation applies only to data received, not data
sent.

The memory allocation for the Group Replication delivery
message service is the sum of the
`message_service_received_message` and
`message_service_queue` event values. For
example:

```sql
SELECT * FROM (
                SELECT
                  (CASE
                     WHEN EVENT_NAME = 'memory/group_rpl/message_service_received_message'
                     THEN 'memory/group_rpl/message_service'
                     WHEN EVENT_NAME = 'memory/group_rpl/message_service_queue'
                     THEN 'memory/group_rpl/message_service'
                     ELSE 'memory_gr_rest'
                  END) AS EVENT_NAME,
                  SUM(COUNT_ALLOC), SUM(COUNT_FREE),
                  SUM(SUM_NUMBER_OF_BYTES_ALLOC),
                  SUM(SUM_NUMBER_OF_BYTES_FREE), SUM(LOW_COUNT_USED),
                  SUM(CURRENT_COUNT_USED), SUM(HIGH_COUNT_USED),
                  SUM(LOW_NUMBER_OF_BYTES_USED), SUM(CURRENT_NUMBER_OF_BYTES_USED),
                  SUM(HIGH_NUMBER_OF_BYTES_USED)
                FROM performance_schema.memory_summary_global_by_event_name

                            THEN 'memory/group_rpl/message_service'
                            WHEN EVENT_NAME = 'memory/group_rpl/message_service_queue'

##### Memory Used to Broadcast and Receive Transactions

The memory allocation for the broadcasting and receiving
transactions to and from the network is the sum of the
`wGcs_message_data::m_buffer` and
`GCS_XCom::xcom_cache` event values. For
example:

```sql
SELECT * FROM (
                SELECT
                  (CASE
                    WHEN EVENT_NAME = 'memory/group_rpl/Gcs_message_data::m_buffer'
                    THEN 'memory/group_rpl/memory_gr'
                    WHEN EVENT_NAME = 'memory/group_rpl/GCS_XCom::xcom_cache'
                    THEN 'memory/group_rpl/memory_gr'
                    ELSE 'memory_gr_rest'
                  END) AS EVENT_NAME,
                  SUM(COUNT_ALLOC), SUM(COUNT_FREE),
                  SUM(SUM_NUMBER_OF_BYTES_ALLOC),

                           THEN 'memory/group_rpl/memory_gr'
                           WHEN EVENT_NAME = 'memory/group_rpl/GCS_XCom::xcom_cache'
