### 8.2.6 Access Control, Stage 1: Connection Verification

When you attempt to connect to a MySQL server, the server accepts
or rejects the connection based on these conditions:

- Your identity and whether you can verify it by supplying the
  proper credentials.
- Whether your account is locked or unlocked.

The server checks credentials first, then account locking state. A
failure at either step causes the server to deny access to you
completely. Otherwise, the server accepts the connection, and then
enters Stage 2 and waits for requests.

The server performs identity and credentials checking using
columns in the `user` table, accepting the
connection only if these conditions are satisfied:

- The client host name and user name match the
  `Host` and `User` columns in
  some `user` table row. For the rules
  governing permissible `Host` and
  `User` values, see
  [Section 8.2.4, “Specifying Account Names”](account-names.md "8.2.4 Specifying Account Names").
- The client supplies the credentials specified in the row (for
  example, a password), as indicated by the
  `authentication_string` column. Credentials
  are interpreted using the authentication plugin named in the
  `plugin` column.
- The row indicates that the account is unlocked. Locking state
  is recorded in the `account_locked` column,
  which must have a value of `'N'`. Account
  locking can be set or changed with the
  [`CREATE USER`](create-user.md "15.7.1.3 CREATE USER Statement") or
  [`ALTER USER`](alter-user.md "15.7.1.1 ALTER USER Statement") statement.

Your identity is based on two pieces of information:

- Your MySQL user name.
- The client host from which you connect.

If the `User` column value is nonblank, the user
name in an incoming connection must match exactly. If the
`User` value is blank, it matches any user name.
If the `user` table row that matches an incoming
connection has a blank user name, the user is considered to be an
anonymous user with no name, not a user with the name that the
client actually specified. This means that a blank user name is
used for all further access checking for the duration of the
connection (that is, during Stage 2).

The `authentication_string` column can be blank.
This is not a wildcard and does not mean that any password
matches. It means that the user must connect without specifying a
password. The authentication method implemented by the plugin that
authenticates the client may or may not use the password in the
`authentication_string` column. In this case, it
is possible that an external password is also used to authenticate
to the MySQL server.

Nonblank password values stored in the
`authentication_string` column of the
`user` table are encrypted. MySQL does not store
passwords as cleartext for anyone to see. Rather, the password
supplied by a user who is attempting to connect is encrypted
(using the password hashing method implemented by the account
authentication plugin). The encrypted password then is used during
the connection process when checking whether the password is
correct. This is done without the encrypted password ever
traveling over the connection. See [Section 8.2.1, “Account User Names and Passwords”](user-names.md "8.2.1 Account User Names and Passwords").

From the MySQL server's point of view, the encrypted password
is the *real* password, so you should never
give anyone access to it. In particular, *do not give
nonadministrative users read access to tables in the
`mysql` system database*.

The following table shows how various combinations of
`User` and `Host` values in the
`user` table apply to incoming connections.

| `User` Value | `Host` Value | Permissible Connections |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `'fred'` | `'h1.example.net'` | `fred`, connecting from `h1.example.net` |
| `''` | `'h1.example.net'` | Any user, connecting from `h1.example.net` |
| `'fred'` | `'%'` | `fred`, connecting from any host |
| `''` | `'%'` | Any user, connecting from any host |
| `'fred'` | `'%.example.net'` | `fred`, connecting from any host in the `example.net` domain |
| `'fred'` | `'x.example.%'` | `fred`, connecting from `x.example.net`, `x.example.com`, `x.example.edu`, and so on; this is probably not useful |
| `'fred'` | `'198.51.100.177'` | `fred`, connecting from the host with IP address `198.51.100.177` |
| `'fred'` | `'198.51.100.%'` | `fred`, connecting from any host in the `198.51.100` class C subnet |
| `'fred'` | `'198.51.100.0/255.255.255.0'` | Same as previous example |

It is possible for the client host name and user name of an
incoming connection to match more than one row in the
`user` table. The preceding set of examples
demonstrates this: Several of the entries shown match a connection
from `h1.example.net` by `fred`.

When multiple matches are possible, the server must determine
which of them to use. It resolves this issue as follows:

- Whenever the server reads the `user` table
  into memory, it sorts the rows.
- When a client attempts to connect, the server looks through
  the rows in sorted order.
- The server uses the first row that matches the client host
  name and user name.

The server uses sorting rules that order rows with the
most-specific `Host` values first:

- Literal IP addresses and host names are the most specific.
- Prior to MySQL 8.0.23, the specificity of a literal IP address
  is not affected by whether it has a netmask, so
  `198.51.100.13` and
  `198.51.100.0/255.255.255.0` are considered
  equally specific. As of MySQL 8.0.23, accounts with an IP
  address in the host part have this order of specificity:

  - Accounts that have the host part given as an IP address:

    ```sql
    CREATE USER 'user_name'@'127.0.0.1';
    CREATE USER 'user_name'@'198.51.100.44';
    ```
  - Accounts that have the host part given as an IP address
    using CIDR notation:

    ```sql
    CREATE USER 'user_name'@'192.0.2.21/8';
    CREATE USER 'user_name'@'198.51.100.44/16';
    ```
  - Accounts that have the host part given as an IP address
    with a subnet mask:

    ```sql
    CREATE USER 'user_name'@'192.0.2.0/255.255.255.0';
    CREATE USER 'user_name'@'198.51.0.0/255.255.0.0';
    ```
- The pattern `'%'` means “any
  host” and is least specific.
- The empty string `''` also means “any
  host” but sorts after `'%'`.

Non-TCP (socket file, named pipe, and shared memory) connections
are treated as local connections and match a host part of
`localhost` if there are any such accounts, or
host parts with wildcards that match `localhost`
otherwise (for example, `local%`,
`l%`, `%`).

The treatment of `'%'` as equivalent to
`localhost` is deprecated as of MySQL 8.0.35, and
you should expect this behavior to removed from a future version
of MySQL.

Rows with the same `Host` value are ordered with
the most-specific `User` values first. A blank
`User` value means “any user” and is
least specific, so for rows with the same `Host`
value, nonanonymous users sort before anonymous users.

For rows with equally-specific `Host` and
`User` values, the order is nondeterministic.

To see how this works, suppose that the `user`
table looks like this:

```none
+-----------+----------+-
| Host      | User     | ...
+-----------+----------+-
| %         | root     | ...
| %         | jeffrey  | ...
| localhost | root     | ...
| localhost |          | ...
+-----------+----------+-
```

When the server reads the table into memory, it sorts the rows
using the rules just described. The result after sorting looks
like this:

```none
+-----------+----------+-
| Host      | User     | ...
+-----------+----------+-
| localhost | root     | ...
| localhost |          | ...
| %         | jeffrey  | ...
| %         | root     | ...
+-----------+----------+-
```

When a client attempts to connect, the server looks through the
sorted rows and uses the first match found. For a connection from
`localhost` by `jeffrey`, two of
the rows from the table match: the one with
`Host` and `User` values of
`'localhost'` and `''`, and the
one with values of `'%'` and
`'jeffrey'`. The `'localhost'`
row appears first in sorted order, so that is the one the server
uses.

Here is another example. Suppose that the `user`
table looks like this:

```none
+----------------+----------+-
| Host           | User     | ...
+----------------+----------+-
| %              | jeffrey  | ...
| h1.example.net |          | ...
+----------------+----------+-
```

The sorted table looks like this:

```none
+----------------+----------+-
| Host           | User     | ...
+----------------+----------+-
| h1.example.net |          | ...
| %              | jeffrey  | ...
+----------------+----------+-
```

The first row matches a connection by any user from
`h1.example.net`, whereas the second row matches
a connection by `jeffrey` from any host.

Note

It is a common misconception to think that, for a given user
name, all rows that explicitly name that user are used first
when the server attempts to find a match for the connection.
This is not true. The preceding example illustrates this, where
a connection from `h1.example.net` by
`jeffrey` is first matched not by the row
containing `'jeffrey'` as the
`User` column value, but by the row with no
user name. As a result, `jeffrey` is
authenticated as an anonymous user, even though he specified a
user name when connecting.

If you are able to connect to the server, but your privileges are
not what you expect, you probably are being authenticated as some
other account. To find out what account the server used to
authenticate you, use the
[`CURRENT_USER()`](information-functions.md#function_current-user) function. (See
[Section 14.15, “Information Functions”](information-functions.md "14.15 Information Functions").) It returns a value in
`user_name@host_name`
format that indicates the `User` and
`Host` values from the matching
`user` table row. Suppose that
`jeffrey` connects and issues the following
query:

```sql
mysql> SELECT CURRENT_USER();
+----------------+
| CURRENT_USER() |
+----------------+
| @localhost     |
+----------------+
```

The result shown here indicates that the matching
`user` table row had a blank
`User` column value. In other words, the server
is treating `jeffrey` as an anonymous user.

Another way to diagnose authentication problems is to print out
the `user` table and sort it by hand to see where
the first match is being made.
