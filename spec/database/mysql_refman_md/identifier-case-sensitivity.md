### 11.2.3 Identifier Case Sensitivity

In MySQL, databases correspond to directories within the data
directory. Each table within a database corresponds to at least
one file within the database directory (and possibly more,
depending on the storage engine). Triggers also correspond to
files. Consequently, the case sensitivity of the underlying
operating system plays a part in the case sensitivity of
database, table, and trigger names. This means such names are
not case-sensitive in Windows, but are case-sensitive in most
varieties of Unix. One notable exception is macOS, which is
Unix-based but uses a default file system type (HFS+) that is
not case-sensitive. However, macOS also supports UFS volumes,
which are case-sensitive just as on any Unix. See
[Section 1.6.1, “MySQL Extensions to Standard SQL”](extensions-to-ansi.md "1.6.1 MySQL Extensions to Standard SQL"). The
[`lower_case_table_names`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_lower_case_table_names) system
variable also affects how the server handles identifier case
sensitivity, as described later in this section.

Note

Although database, table, and trigger names are not
case-sensitive on some platforms, you should not refer to one
of these using different cases within the same statement. The
following statement would not work because it refers to a
table both as `my_table` and as
`MY_TABLE`:

```sql
mysql> SELECT * FROM my_table WHERE MY_TABLE.col=1;
```

Partition, subpartition, column, index, stored routine, event,
and resource group names are not case-sensitive on any platform,
nor are column aliases.

However, names of logfile groups are case-sensitive. This
differs from standard SQL.

By default, table aliases are case-sensitive on Unix, but not so
on Windows or macOS. The following statement would not work on
Unix, because it refers to the alias both as
`a` and as `A`:

```sql
mysql> SELECT col_name FROM tbl_name AS a
       WHERE a.col_name = 1 OR A.col_name = 2;
```

However, this same statement is permitted on Windows. To avoid
problems caused by such differences, it is best to adopt a
consistent convention, such as always creating and referring to
databases and tables using lowercase names. This convention is
recommended for maximum portability and ease of use.

How table and database names are stored on disk and used in
MySQL is affected by the
[`lower_case_table_names`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_lower_case_table_names) system
variable.
[`lower_case_table_names`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_lower_case_table_names) can take
the values shown in the following table. This variable does
*not* affect case sensitivity of trigger
identifiers. On Unix, the default value of
[`lower_case_table_names`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_lower_case_table_names) is 0. On
Windows, the default value is 1. On macOS, the default value is
2.

[`lower_case_table_names`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_lower_case_table_names) can only
be configured when initializing the server. Changing the
[`lower_case_table_names`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_lower_case_table_names) setting
after the server is initialized is prohibited.

| Value | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `0` | Table and database names are stored on disk using the lettercase specified in the [`CREATE TABLE`](create-table.md "15.1.20 CREATE TABLE Statement") or [`CREATE DATABASE`](create-database.md "15.1.12 CREATE DATABASE Statement") statement. Name comparisons are case-sensitive. You should *not* set this variable to 0 if you are running MySQL on a system that has case-insensitive file names (such as Windows or macOS). If you force this variable to 0 with [`--lower-case-table-names=0`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_lower_case_table_names) on a case-insensitive file system and access `MyISAM` tablenames using different lettercases, index corruption may result. |
| `1` | Table names are stored in lowercase on disk and name comparisons are not case-sensitive. MySQL converts all table names to lowercase on storage and lookup. This behavior also applies to database names and table aliases. |
| `2` | Table and database names are stored on disk using the lettercase specified in the [`CREATE TABLE`](create-table.md "15.1.20 CREATE TABLE Statement") or [`CREATE DATABASE`](create-database.md "15.1.12 CREATE DATABASE Statement") statement, but MySQL converts them to lowercase on lookup. Name comparisons are not case-sensitive. This works *only* on file systems that are not case-sensitive! `InnoDB` table names and view names are stored in lowercase, as for `lower_case_table_names=1`. |

If you are using MySQL on only one platform, you do not normally
have to use a
[`lower_case_table_names`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_lower_case_table_names) setting
other than the default. However, you may encounter difficulties
if you want to transfer tables between platforms that differ in
file system case sensitivity. For example, on Unix, you can have
two different tables named `my_table` and
`MY_TABLE`, but on Windows these two names are
considered identical. To avoid data transfer problems arising
from lettercase of database or table names, you have two
options:

- Use `lower_case_table_names=1` on all
  systems. The main disadvantage with this is that when you
  use [`SHOW TABLES`](show-tables.md "15.7.7.39 SHOW TABLES Statement") or
  [`SHOW DATABASES`](show-databases.md "15.7.7.14 SHOW DATABASES Statement"), you do not
  see the names in their original lettercase.
- Use `lower_case_table_names=0` on Unix and
  `lower_case_table_names=2` on Windows. This
  preserves the lettercase of database and table names. The
  disadvantage of this is that you must ensure that your
  statements always refer to your database and table names
  with the correct lettercase on Windows. If you transfer your
  statements to Unix, where lettercase is significant, they do
  not work if the lettercase is incorrect.

  **Exception**: If you are using
  `InnoDB` tables and you are trying to avoid
  these data transfer problems, you should use
  [`lower_case_table_names=1`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_lower_case_table_names) on
  all platforms to force names to be converted to lowercase.

Object names may be considered duplicates if their uppercase
forms are equal according to a binary collation. That is true
for names of cursors, conditions, procedures, functions,
savepoints, stored routine parameters, stored program local
variables, and plugins. It is not true for names of columns,
constraints, databases, partitions, statements prepared with
[`PREPARE`](prepare.md "15.5.1 PREPARE Statement"), tables, triggers, users,
and user-defined variables.

File system case sensitivity can affect searches in string
columns of `INFORMATION_SCHEMA` tables. For
more information, see
[Section 12.8.7, “Using Collation in INFORMATION\_SCHEMA Searches”](charset-collation-information-schema.md "12.8.7 Using Collation in INFORMATION_SCHEMA Searches").
