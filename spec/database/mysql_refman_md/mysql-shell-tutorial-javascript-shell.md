### 22.3.1 MySQL Shell

This quick-start guide assumes a certain level of familiarity with
MySQL Shell. The following section is a high level overview, see
the MySQL Shell documentation for more information. MySQL Shell
is a unified scripting interface to MySQL Server. It supports
scripting in JavaScript and Python. JavaScript is the default
processing mode.

#### Start MySQL Shell

After you have installed and started MySQL server, connect
MySQL Shell to the server instance. You need to know the
address of the MySQL server instance you plan to connect to. To
be able to use the instance as a Document Store, the server
instance must have X Plugin installed and you should connect to
the server using X Protocol. For example to connect to the
instance `ds1.example.com` on the default
X Protocol port of 33060 use the network string
`user@ds1.example.com:33060`.

Tip

If you connect to the instance using classic MySQL protocol, for
example by using the default
[`port`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_port) of 3306 instead of the
[`mysqlx_port`](x-plugin-options-system-variables.md#sysvar_mysqlx_port), you
*cannot* use the Document Store
functionality shown in this tutorial. For example the
`db` global object is not populated. To use
the Document Store, always connect using X Protocol.

If MySQL Shell is not already running, open a terminal window
and issue:

```terminal
mysqlsh user@ds1.example.com:33060/world_x
```

Alternatively, if MySQL Shell is already running use the
`\connect` command by issuing:

```mysqlsh
\connect user@ds1.example.com:33060/world_x
```

You need to specify the address of the MySQL server instance
which you want to connect MySQL Shell to. For example in the
previous example:

- *`user`* represents the user name of
  your MySQL account.
- `ds1.example.com` is the hostname of the
  server instance running MySQL. Replace this with the
  hostname of the MySQL server instance you are using as a
  Document Store.
- The default schema for this session is
  `world_x`. For instructions on setting up
  the `world_x` schema, see
  [Section 22.3.2, “Download and Import world\_x Database”](mysql-shell-tutorial-javascript-download.md "22.3.2 Download and Import world_x Database").

For more information, see
[Section 6.2.5, “Connecting to the Server Using URI-Like Strings or Key-Value Pairs”](connecting-using-uri-or-key-value-pairs.md "6.2.5 Connecting to the Server Using URI-Like Strings or Key-Value Pairs").

Once MySQL Shell opens, the `mysql-js>` prompt
indicates that the active language for this session is
JavaScript.

```mysqlsh
mysql-js>
```

MySQL Shell supports input-line editing as follows:

- **left-arrow** and **right-arrow**
  keys move horizontally within the current input line.
- **up-arrow** and **down-arrow**
  keys move up and down through the set of previously entered
  lines.
- **Backspace** deletes the character before the
  cursor and typing new characters enters them at the cursor
  position.
- **Enter** sends the current input line to the
  server.

#### Get Help for MySQL Shell

Type **mysqlsh --help** at the prompt of your
command interpreter for a list of command-line options.

```terminal
mysqlsh --help
```

Type `\help` at the MySQL Shell prompt for a
list of available commands and their descriptions.

```mysqlsh
mysql-js> \help
```

Type `\help` followed by a command name for
detailed help about an individual MySQL Shell command. For
example, to view help on the `\connect`
command, issue:

```mysqlsh
mysql-js> \help \connect
```

#### Quit MySQL Shell

To quit MySQL Shell, issue the following command:

```mysqlsh
mysql-js> \quit
```
