### 10.5.6 Optimizing InnoDB Queries

To tune queries for `InnoDB` tables, create an
appropriate set of indexes on each table. See
[Section 10.3.1, “How MySQL Uses Indexes”](mysql-indexes.md "10.3.1 How MySQL Uses Indexes") for details. Follow these
guidelines for `InnoDB` indexes:

- Because each `InnoDB` table has a
  [primary key](glossary.md#glos_primary_key "primary key") (whether
  you request one or not), specify a set of primary key
  columns for each table, columns that are used in the most
  important and time-critical queries.
- Do not specify too many or too long columns in the primary
  key, because these column values are duplicated in each
  secondary index. When an index contains unnecessary data,
  the I/O to read this data and memory to cache it reduce the
  performance and scalability of the server.
- Do not create a separate
  [secondary index](glossary.md#glos_secondary_index "secondary index")
  for each column, because each query can only make use of one
  index. Indexes on rarely tested columns or columns with only
  a few different values might not be helpful for any queries.
  If you have many queries for the same table, testing
  different combinations of columns, try to create a small
  number of
  [concatenated
  indexes](glossary.md#glos_concatenated_index "concatenated index") rather than a large number of single-column
  indexes. If an index contains all the columns needed for the
  result set (known as a
  [covering index](glossary.md#glos_covering_index "covering index")),
  the query might be able to avoid reading the table data at
  all.
- If an indexed column cannot contain any
  `NULL` values, declare it as `NOT
  NULL` when you create the table. The optimizer can
  better determine which index is most effective to use for a
  query, when it knows whether each column contains
  `NULL` values.
- You can optimize single-query transactions for
  `InnoDB` tables, using the technique in
  [Section 10.5.3, “Optimizing InnoDB Read-Only Transactions”](innodb-performance-ro-txn.md "10.5.3 Optimizing InnoDB Read-Only Transactions").
