#### 20.7.6.2 Reducing the cache size

The minimum setting for the XCom message cache size is 1 GB up
to MySQL 8.0.20. From MySQL 8.0.21, the minimum setting is
134217728 bytes (128 MB), which enables deployment on a host
that has a restricted amount of available memory. Having a very
low
[`group_replication_message_cache_size`](group-replication-system-variables.md#sysvar_group_replication_message_cache_size)
setting is not recommended if the host is on an unstable
network, because a smaller message cache makes it harder for
group members to reconnect after a transient loss of
connectivity.

If a reconnecting member cannot retrieve all the messages it
needs from the XCom message cache, the member must leave the
group and rejoin it, in order to retrieve the missing
transactions from another member's binary log using distributed
recovery. From MySQL 8.0.21, a member that has left a group
makes three auto-rejoin attempts by default, so the process of
rejoining the group can still take place without operator
intervention. However, rejoining using distributed recovery is a
significantly longer and more complex process than retrieving
messages from an XCom message cache, so the member takes longer
to become available and the performance of the group can be
impacted. On a stable network, which minimizes the frequency and
duration of transient losses of connectivity for members, the
frequency of this occurrence should also be minimized, so the
group might be able to tolerate a smaller XCom message cache
size without a significant impact on its performance.

If you are considering reducing the cache size limit, you can
query the Performance Schema table
[`memory_summary_global_by_event_name`](performance-schema-memory-summary-tables.md "29.12.20.10 Memory Summary Tables")
using the following statement:

```sql
SELECT * FROM performance_schema.memory_summary_global_by_event_name
  WHERE EVENT_NAME LIKE 'memory/group_rpl/GCS_XCom::xcom_cache';
```

This returns memory usage statistics for the message cache,
including the current number of cached entries and current size
of the cache. If you reduce the cache size limit, XCom removes
the oldest entries that have been decided and delivered until
the current size is below the limit. XCom might temporarily
exceed the cache size limit while this removal process is
ongoing.
