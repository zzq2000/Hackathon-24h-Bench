#### 2.3.4.7 Customizing the PATH for MySQL Tools

Warning

You must exercise great care when editing your system
`PATH` by hand; accidental deletion or
modification of any portion of the existing
`PATH` value can leave you with a
malfunctioning or even unusable system.

To make it easier to invoke MySQL programs, you can add the path
name of the MySQL `bin` directory to your
Windows system `PATH` environment variable:

- On the Windows desktop, right-click the My
  Computer icon, and select
  Properties.
- Next select the Advanced tab from
  the System Properties menu that appears,
  and click the Environment Variables
  button.
- Under System Variables, select
  Path, and then click the
  Edit button. The Edit System
  Variable dialogue should appear.
- Place your cursor at the end of the text appearing in the
  space marked Variable Value. (Use the
  **End** key to ensure that your cursor is
  positioned at the very end of the text in this space.) Then
  enter the complete path name of your MySQL
  `bin` directory (for example,
  `C:\Program Files\MySQL\MySQL Server
  8.0\bin`)

  Note

  There must be a semicolon separating this path from any
  values present in this field.

  Dismiss this dialogue, and each dialogue in turn, by
  clicking OK until all of the
  dialogues that were opened have been dismissed. The new
  `PATH` value should now be available to any
  new command shell you open, allowing you to invoke any MySQL
  executable program by typing its name at the DOS prompt from
  any directory on the system, without having to supply the
  path. This includes the servers, the
  [**mysql**](mysql.md "6.5.1 mysql — The MySQL Command-Line Client") client, and all MySQL command-line
  utilities such as [**mysqladmin**](mysqladmin.md "6.5.2 mysqladmin — A MySQL Server Administration Program") and
  [**mysqldump**](mysqldump.md "6.5.4 mysqldump — A Database Backup Program").

You should not add the MySQL `bin` directory
to your Windows `PATH` if you are running
multiple MySQL servers on the same machine.
