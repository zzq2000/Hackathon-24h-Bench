### 7.5.1 Installing and Uninstalling Components

Components must be loaded into the server before they can be used.
MySQL supports manual component loading at runtime and automatic
loading during server startup.

While a component is loaded, information about it is available as
described in [Section 7.5.2, “Obtaining Component Information”](obtaining-component-information.md "7.5.2 Obtaining Component Information").

The [`INSTALL COMPONENT`](install-component.md "15.7.4.3 INSTALL COMPONENT Statement") and
[`UNINSTALL COMPONENT`](uninstall-component.md "15.7.4.5 UNINSTALL COMPONENT Statement") SQL statements
enable component loading and unloading. For example:

```sql
INSTALL COMPONENT 'file://component_validate_password';
UNINSTALL COMPONENT 'file://component_validate_password';
```

A loader service handles component loading and unloading, and also
registers loaded components in the
`mysql.component` system table.

The SQL statements for component manipulation affect server
operation and the `mysql.component` system table
as follows:

- [`INSTALL COMPONENT`](install-component.md "15.7.4.3 INSTALL COMPONENT Statement") loads
  components into the server. The components become active
  immediately. The loader service also registers loaded
  components in the `mysql.component` system
  table. For subsequent server restarts, the loader service
  loads any components listed in
  `mysql.component` during the startup
  sequence. This occurs even if the server is started with the
  [`--skip-grant-tables`](server-options.md#option_mysqld_skip-grant-tables) option. The
  optional `SET` clause permits setting
  component system-variable values when you install components.
- [`UNINSTALL COMPONENT`](uninstall-component.md "15.7.4.5 UNINSTALL COMPONENT Statement") deactivates
  components and unloads them from the server. The loader
  service also unregisters the components from the
  `mysql.component` system table so that the
  server no longer loads them during its startup sequence for
  subsequent restarts.

Compared to the corresponding [`INSTALL
PLUGIN`](install-plugin.md "15.7.4.4 INSTALL PLUGIN Statement") statement for server plugins, the
[`INSTALL COMPONENT`](install-component.md "15.7.4.3 INSTALL COMPONENT Statement") statement for
components offers the significant advantage that it is not
necessary to know any platform-specific file name suffix for
naming the component. This means that a given
[`INSTALL COMPONENT`](install-component.md "15.7.4.3 INSTALL COMPONENT Statement") statement can be
executed uniformly across platforms.

A component when installed may also automatically install related
loadable functions. If so, the component when uninstalled also
automatically uninstalls those functions.
