### 8.6.3 MySQL Enterprise Encryption Usage and Examples

To use MySQL Enterprise Encryption in applications, invoke the functions that are
appropriate for the operations you wish to perform. This section
demonstrates how to carry out some representative tasks.

In releases before MySQL 8.0.30, MySQL Enterprise Encryption's functions are based
on the `openssl_udf` shared library. From MySQL
8.0.30, the functions are provided by a MySQL component
`component_enterprise_encryption`. In some cases,
the behavior of the component functions differs from the behavior
of the legacy functions provided by the
`openssl_udf`. For a list of the differences, see
[Upgrading MySQL Enterprise Encryption](enterprise-encryption-installation.md#enterprise-encryption-upgrading "Upgrading MySQL Enterprise Encryption"). For
full details of the behavior of each component's functions, see
[Section 8.6.4, “MySQL Enterprise Encryption Function Reference”](enterprise-encryption-function-reference.md "8.6.4 MySQL Enterprise Encryption Function Reference").

If you install the legacy functions then upgrade to MySQL 8.0.30
or later, the functions you created remain available, are
supported, and continue to work in the same way. However, they are
deprecated from MySQL 8.0.30, and it is recommended that you
install the MySQL Enterprise Encryption component
`component_enterprise_encryption` instead. For
instructions to upgrade, see
[Installation From MySQL 8.0.30](enterprise-encryption-installation.md#enterprise-encryption-installation-30 "Installation From MySQL 8.0.30").

The following general considerations apply when choosing key
lengths and encryption algorithms:

- The strength of encryption for private and public keys
  increases with the key size, but the time for key generation
  increases as well.
- For the legacy functions, generation of DH keys takes much
  longer than RSA or DSA keys. The component functions from
  MySQL 8.0.30 only support RSA keys.
- Asymmetric encryption functions consume more resources
  compared to symmetric functions. They are good for encrypting
  small amounts of data and creating and verifying signatures.
  For encrypting large amounts of data, symmetric encryption
  functions are faster. MySQL Server provides the
  [`AES_ENCRYPT()`](encryption-functions.md#function_aes-encrypt) and
  [`AES_DECRYPT()`](encryption-functions.md#function_aes-decrypt) functions for
  symmetric encryption.

Key string values can be created at runtime and stored into a
variable or table using
[`SET`](set-variable.md "15.7.6.1 SET Syntax for Variable Assignment"),
[`SELECT`](select.md "15.2.13 SELECT Statement"), or
[`INSERT`](insert.md "15.2.7 INSERT Statement"). This example works with
both the component function and the legacy function:

```sql
SET @priv1 = create_asymmetric_priv_key('RSA', 2048);
SELECT create_asymmetric_priv_key('RSA', 2048) INTO @priv2;
INSERT INTO t (key_col) VALUES(create_asymmetric_priv_key('RSA', 1024));
```

Key string values stored in files can be read using the
[`LOAD_FILE()`](string-functions.md#function_load-file) function by users who
have the [`FILE`](privileges-provided.md#priv_file) privilege. Digest and
signature strings can be handled similarly.

- [Create a private/public key pair](enterprise-encryption-usage.md#enterprise-encryption-usage-create-key-pair "Create a private/public key pair")
- [Use the public key to encrypt data and the private key to decrypt it](enterprise-encryption-usage.md#enterprise-encryption-usage-encrypt-decrypt "Use the public key to encrypt data and the private key to decrypt it")
- [Generate a digest from a string](enterprise-encryption-usage.md#enterprise-encryption-usage-create-digest "Generate a digest from a string")
- [Use the digest with a key pair](enterprise-encryption-usage.md#enterprise-encryption-usage-digital-signing "Use the digest with a key pair")

#### Create a private/public key pair

This example works with both the component functions and the
legacy functions:

```sql
-- Encryption algorithm
SET @algo = 'RSA';
-- Key length in bits; make larger for stronger keys
SET @key_len = 2048;

-- Create private key
SET @priv = create_asymmetric_priv_key(@algo, @key_len);
-- Derive corresponding public key from private key, using same algorithm
SET @pub = create_asymmetric_pub_key(@algo, @priv);
```

You can use the key pair to encrypt and decrypt data or to sign
and verify data.

#### Use the public key to encrypt data and the private key to decrypt it

This example works with both the component functions and the
legacy functions. In both cases, the members of the key pair
must be RSA keys:

```sql
SET @ciphertext = asymmetric_encrypt(@algo, 'My secret text', @pub);
SET @plaintext = asymmetric_decrypt(@algo, @ciphertext, @priv);
```

#### Generate a digest from a string

This example works with both the component functions and the
legacy functions:

```sql
-- Digest type
SET @dig_type = 'SHA512';

-- Generate digest string
SET @dig = create_digest(@dig_type, 'My text to digest');
```

#### Use the digest with a key pair

The key pair can be used to sign data, then verify that the
signature matches the digest. This example works with both the
component functions and the legacy functions:

```sql
-- Encryption algorithm; keys must
-- have been created using same algorithm
SET @algo = 'RSA';
–- Digest algorithm to sign the data
SET @dig_type = 'SHA512';

-- Generate signature for digest and verify signature against digest
SET @sig = asymmetric_sign(@algo, @dig, @priv, @dig_type);
-- Verify signature against digest
SET @verf = asymmetric_verify(@algo, @dig, @sig, @pub, @dig_type);
```

For the legacy functions, signatures require a digest. For the
component functions, signatures do not require a digest, and can
use any data string. The digest type in these functions refers
to the algorithm that is used to sign the data, not the
algorithm that was used to create the original input for the
signature. This example is for the component functions:

```sql
-- Encryption algorithm; keys must
-- have been created using same algorithm
SET @algo = 'RSA';
–- Arbitrary text string for signature
SET @text = repeat('j', 256);
–- Digest algorithm to sign the data
SET @dig_type = 'SHA512';

-- Generate signature for digest and verify signature against digest
SET @sig = asymmetric_sign(@algo, @text, @priv, @dig_type);
-- Verify signature against digest
SET @verf = asymmetric_verify(@algo, @text, @sig, @pub, @dig_type);
```
