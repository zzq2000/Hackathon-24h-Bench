### 10.5.3 Optimizing InnoDB Read-Only Transactions

`InnoDB` can avoid the overhead associated with
setting up the [transaction
ID](glossary.md#glos_transaction_id "transaction ID") (`TRX_ID` field) for transactions
that are known to be read-only. A transaction ID is only needed
for a [transaction](glossary.md#glos_transaction "transaction") that
might perform write operations or
[locking reads](glossary.md#glos_locking_read "locking read") such as
`SELECT ... FOR UPDATE`. Eliminating
unnecessary transaction IDs reduces the size of internal data
structures that are consulted each time a query or data change
statement constructs a [read
view](glossary.md#glos_read_view "read view").

`InnoDB` detects read-only transactions when:

- The transaction is started with the
  [`START TRANSACTION
  READ ONLY`](commit.md "15.3.1 START TRANSACTION, COMMIT, and ROLLBACK Statements") statement. In this case, attempting to
  make changes to the database (for `InnoDB`,
  `MyISAM`, or other types of tables) causes
  an error, and the transaction continues in read-only state:

  ```none
  ERROR 1792 (25006): Cannot execute statement in a READ ONLY transaction.
  ```

  You can still make changes to session-specific temporary
  tables in a read-only transaction, or issue locking queries
  for them, because those changes and locks are not visible to
  any other transaction.
- The [`autocommit`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_autocommit) setting is
  turned on, so that the transaction is guaranteed to be a
  single statement, and the single statement making up the
  transaction is a “non-locking”
  [`SELECT`](select.md "15.2.13 SELECT Statement") statement. That is, a
  `SELECT` that does not use a `FOR
  UPDATE` or `LOCK IN SHARED MODE`
  clause.
- The transaction is started without the `READ
  ONLY` option, but no updates or statements that
  explicitly lock rows have been executed yet. Until updates
  or explicit locks are required, a transaction stays in
  read-only mode.

Thus, for a read-intensive application such as a report
generator, you can tune a sequence of `InnoDB`
queries by grouping them inside
[`START TRANSACTION READ
ONLY`](commit.md "15.3.1 START TRANSACTION, COMMIT, and ROLLBACK Statements") and
[`COMMIT`](commit.md "15.3.1 START TRANSACTION, COMMIT, and ROLLBACK Statements"), or by
turning on the [`autocommit`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_autocommit)
setting before running the `SELECT` statements,
or simply by avoiding any data change statements interspersed
with the queries.

For information about
[`START
TRANSACTION`](commit.md "15.3.1 START TRANSACTION, COMMIT, and ROLLBACK Statements") and
[`autocommit`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_autocommit), see
[Section 15.3.1, “START TRANSACTION, COMMIT, and ROLLBACK Statements”](commit.md "15.3.1 START TRANSACTION, COMMIT, and ROLLBACK Statements").

Note

Transactions that qualify as auto-commit, non-locking, and
read-only (AC-NL-RO) are kept out of certain internal
`InnoDB` data structures and are therefore
not listed in
[`SHOW ENGINE
INNODB STATUS`](show-engine.md "15.7.7.15 SHOW ENGINE Statement") output.
