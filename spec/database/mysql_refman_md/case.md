#### 15.6.5.1 CASE Statement

```sql
CASE case_value
    WHEN when_value THEN statement_list
    [WHEN when_value THEN statement_list] ...
    [ELSE statement_list]
END CASE
```

Or:

```sql
CASE
    WHEN search_condition THEN statement_list
    [WHEN search_condition THEN statement_list] ...
    [ELSE statement_list]
END CASE
```

The [`CASE`](case.md "15.6.5.1 CASE Statement") statement for stored
programs implements a complex conditional construct.

Note

There is also a [`CASE`](flow-control-functions.md#operator_case)
*operator*, which differs from the
[`CASE`](case.md "15.6.5.1 CASE Statement")
*statement* described here. See
[Section 14.5, “Flow Control Functions”](flow-control-functions.md "14.5 Flow Control Functions"). The
[`CASE`](case.md "15.6.5.1 CASE Statement") statement cannot have an
`ELSE NULL` clause, and it is terminated with
`END CASE` instead of `END`.

For the first syntax, *`case_value`* is
an expression. This value is compared to the
*`when_value`* expression in each
`WHEN` clause until one of them is equal. When
an equal *`when_value`* is found, the
corresponding `THEN` clause
*`statement_list`* executes. If no
*`when_value`* is equal, the
`ELSE` clause
*`statement_list`* executes, if there is
one.

This syntax cannot be used to test for equality with
`NULL` because `NULL = NULL`
is false. See [Section 5.3.4.6, “Working with NULL Values”](working-with-null.md "5.3.4.6 Working with NULL Values").

For the second syntax, each `WHEN` clause
*`search_condition`* expression is
evaluated until one is true, at which point its corresponding
`THEN` clause
*`statement_list`* executes. If no
*`search_condition`* is equal, the
`ELSE` clause
*`statement_list`* executes, if there is
one.

If no *`when_value`* or
*`search_condition`* matches the value
tested and the [`CASE`](case.md "15.6.5.1 CASE Statement") statement
contains no `ELSE` clause, a Case
not found for CASE statement error results.

Each *`statement_list`* consists of one
or more SQL statements; an empty
*`statement_list`* is not permitted.

To handle situations where no value is matched by any
`WHEN` clause, use an `ELSE`
containing an empty
[`BEGIN ...
END`](begin-end.md "15.6.1 BEGIN ... END Compound Statement") block, as shown in this example. (The indentation
used here in the `ELSE` clause is for purposes
of clarity only, and is not otherwise significant.)

```sql
DELIMITER |

CREATE PROCEDURE p()
  BEGIN
    DECLARE v INT DEFAULT 1;

    CASE v
      WHEN 2 THEN SELECT v;
      WHEN 3 THEN SELECT 0;
      ELSE
        BEGIN
        END;
    END CASE;
  END;
  |
```
