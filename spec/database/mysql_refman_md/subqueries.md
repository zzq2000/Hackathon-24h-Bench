A subquery is a [`SELECT`](select.md "15.2.13 SELECT Statement") statement
within another statement.

All subquery forms and operations that the SQL standard requires
are supported, as well as a few features that are MySQL-specific.

Here is an example of a subquery:

```sql
SELECT * FROM t1 WHERE column1 = (SELECT column1 FROM t2);
```

In this example, `SELECT * FROM t1 ...` is the
*outer query* (or *outer
statement*), and `(SELECT column1 FROM
t2)` is the *subquery*. We say that
the subquery is *nested* within the outer
query, and in fact it is possible to nest subqueries within other
subqueries, to a considerable depth. A subquery must always appear
within parentheses.

The main advantages of subqueries are:

- They allow queries that are *structured* so
  that it is possible to isolate each part of a statement.
- They provide alternative ways to perform operations that would
  otherwise require complex joins and unions.
- Many people find subqueries more readable than complex joins
  or unions. Indeed, it was the innovation of subqueries that
  gave people the original idea of calling the early SQL
  “Structured Query Language.”

Here is an example statement that shows the major points about
subquery syntax as specified by the SQL standard and supported in
MySQL:

```sql
DELETE FROM t1
WHERE s11 > ANY
 (SELECT COUNT(*) /* no hint */ FROM t2
  WHERE NOT EXISTS
   (SELECT * FROM t3
    WHERE ROW(5*t2.s1,77)=
     (SELECT 50,11*s1 FROM t4 UNION SELECT 50,77 FROM
      (SELECT * FROM t5) AS t5)));
```

A subquery can return a scalar (a single value), a single row, a
single column, or a table (one or more rows of one or more
columns). These are called scalar, column, row, and table
subqueries. Subqueries that return a particular kind of result
often can be used only in certain contexts, as described in the
following sections.

There are few restrictions on the type of statements in which
subqueries can be used. A subquery can contain many of the
keywords or clauses that an ordinary
[`SELECT`](select.md "15.2.13 SELECT Statement") can contain:
`DISTINCT`, `GROUP BY`,
`ORDER BY`, `LIMIT`, joins,
index hints, [`UNION`](union.md "15.2.18 UNION Clause") constructs,
comments, functions, and so on.

Beginning with MySQL 8.0.19, [`TABLE`](table.md "15.2.16 TABLE Statement")
and [`VALUES`](values.md "15.2.19 VALUES Statement") statements can be used
in subqueries. Subqueries using
[`VALUES`](values.md "15.2.19 VALUES Statement") are generally more verbose
versions of subqueries that can be rewritten more compactly using
set notation, or with [`SELECT`](select.md "15.2.13 SELECT Statement") or
[`TABLE`](table.md "15.2.16 TABLE Statement") syntax; assuming that table
`ts` is created using the statement
[`CREATE TABLE
ts VALUES ROW(2), ROW(4), ROW(6)`](create-table-select.md "15.1.20.4 CREATE TABLE ... SELECT Statement"), the statements shown
here are all equivalent:

```sql
SELECT * FROM tt
    WHERE b > ANY (VALUES ROW(2), ROW(4), ROW(6));

SELECT * FROM tt
    WHERE b > ANY (SELECT * FROM ts);

SELECT * FROM tt
    WHERE b > ANY (TABLE ts);
```

Examples of [`TABLE`](table.md "15.2.16 TABLE Statement") subqueries are
shown in the sections that follow.

A subquery's outer statement can be any one of:
[`SELECT`](select.md "15.2.13 SELECT Statement"),
[`INSERT`](insert.md "15.2.7 INSERT Statement"),
[`UPDATE`](update.md "15.2.17 UPDATE Statement"),
[`DELETE`](delete.md "15.2.2 DELETE Statement"),
[`SET`](set-variable.md "15.7.6.1 SET Syntax for Variable Assignment"), or
[`DO`](do.md "15.2.3 DO Statement").

Expressions”](subquery-optimization.md "10.2.2 Optimizing Subqueries, Derived Tables, View References, and Common Table Expressions"). For a discussion of
restrictions on subquery use, including performance issues for
certain forms of subquery syntax, see
