### 12.2.2 UTF-8 for Metadata

Metadata is “the
data about the data.” Anything that
*describes* the database—as opposed to
being the *contents* of the database—is
metadata. Thus column names, database names, user names, version
names, and most of the string results from
[`SHOW`](show.md "15.7.7 SHOW Statements") are metadata. This is also
true of the contents of tables in
`INFORMATION_SCHEMA` because those tables by
definition contain information about database objects.

Representation of metadata must satisfy these requirements:

- All metadata must be in the same character set. Otherwise,
  neither the [`SHOW`](show.md "15.7.7 SHOW Statements") statements
  nor [`SELECT`](select.md "15.2.13 SELECT Statement") statements for
  tables in `INFORMATION_SCHEMA` would work
  properly because different rows in the same column of the
  results of these operations would be in different character
  sets.
- Metadata must include all characters in all languages.
  Otherwise, users would not be able to name columns and
  tables using their own languages.

To satisfy both requirements, MySQL stores metadata in a Unicode
character set, namely UTF-8. This does not cause any disruption
if you never use accented or non-Latin characters. But if you
do, you should be aware that metadata is in UTF-8.

The metadata requirements mean that the return values of the
[`USER()`](information-functions.md#function_user),
[`CURRENT_USER()`](information-functions.md#function_current-user),
[`SESSION_USER()`](information-functions.md#function_session-user),
[`SYSTEM_USER()`](information-functions.md#function_system-user),
[`DATABASE()`](information-functions.md#function_database), and
[`VERSION()`](information-functions.md#function_version) functions have the
UTF-8 character set by default.

The server sets the
[`character_set_system`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_character_set_system) system
variable to the name of the metadata character set:

```sql
mysql> SHOW VARIABLES LIKE 'character_set_system';
+----------------------+---------+
| Variable_name        | Value   |
+----------------------+---------+
| character_set_system | utf8mb3 |
+----------------------+---------+
```

Storage of metadata using Unicode does *not*
mean that the server returns headers of columns and the results
of [`DESCRIBE`](describe.md "15.8.1 DESCRIBE Statement") functions in the
[`character_set_system`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_character_set_system) character
set by default. When you use `SELECT column1 FROM
t`, the name `column1` itself is
returned from the server to the client in the character set
determined by the value of the
[`character_set_results`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_character_set_results) system
variable, which has a default value of
`utf8mb4`. If you want the server to pass
metadata results back in a different character set, use the
[`SET NAMES`](set-names.md "15.7.6.3 SET NAMES Statement") statement to force the
server to perform character set conversion.
[`SET NAMES`](set-names.md "15.7.6.3 SET NAMES Statement") sets the
[`character_set_results`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_character_set_results) and other
related system variables. (See
[Section 12.4, “Connection Character Sets and Collations”](charset-connection.md "12.4 Connection Character Sets and Collations").) Alternatively, a client
program can perform the conversion after receiving the result
from the server. It is more efficient for the client to perform
the conversion, but this option is not always available for all
clients.

If [`character_set_results`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_character_set_results) is set
to `NULL`, no conversion is performed and the
server returns metadata using its original character set (the
set indicated by
[`character_set_system`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_character_set_system)).

Error messages returned from the server to the client are
converted to the client character set automatically, as with
metadata.

If you are using (for example) the
[`USER()`](information-functions.md#function_user) function for comparison or
assignment within a single statement, don't worry. MySQL
performs some automatic conversion for you.

```sql
SELECT * FROM t1 WHERE USER() = latin1_column;
```

This works because the contents of
`latin1_column` are automatically converted to
UTF-8 before the comparison.

```sql
INSERT INTO t1 (latin1_column) SELECT USER();
```

This works because the contents of
[`USER()`](information-functions.md#function_user) are automatically
converted to `latin1` before the assignment.

Although automatic conversion is not in the SQL standard, the
standard does say that every character set is (in terms of
supported characters) a “subset” of Unicode.
Because it is a well-known principle that “what applies to
a superset can apply to a subset,” we believe that a
collation for Unicode can apply for comparisons with non-Unicode
strings. For more information about coercion of strings, see
[Section 12.8.4, “Collation Coercibility in Expressions”](charset-collation-coercibility.md "12.8.4 Collation Coercibility in Expressions").
