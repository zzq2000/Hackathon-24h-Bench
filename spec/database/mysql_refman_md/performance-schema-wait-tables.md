### 29.12.4 Performance Schema Wait Event Tables

[29.12.4.1 The events\_waits\_current Table](performance-schema-events-waits-current-table.md)

[29.12.4.2 The events\_waits\_history Table](performance-schema-events-waits-history-table.md)

[29.12.4.3 The events\_waits\_history\_long Table](performance-schema-events-waits-history-long-table.md)

The Performance Schema instruments waits, which are events that
take time. Within the event hierarchy, wait events nest within
stage events, which nest within statement events, which nest
within transaction events.

These tables store wait events:

- [`events_waits_current`](performance-schema-events-waits-current-table.md "29.12.4.1 The events_waits_current Table"): The
  current wait event for each thread.
- [`events_waits_history`](performance-schema-events-waits-history-table.md "29.12.4.2 The events_waits_history Table"): The most
  recent wait events that have ended per thread.
- [`events_waits_history_long`](performance-schema-events-waits-history-long-table.md "29.12.4.3 The events_waits_history_long Table"): The
  most recent wait events that have ended globally (across all
  threads).

The following sections describe the wait event tables. There are
also summary tables that aggregate information about wait
events; see
[Section 29.12.20.1, “Wait Event Summary Tables”](performance-schema-wait-summary-tables.md "29.12.20.1 Wait Event Summary Tables").

For more information about the relationship between the three
wait event tables, see
[Section 29.9, “Performance Schema Tables for Current and Historical Events”](performance-schema-event-tables.md "29.9 Performance Schema Tables for Current and Historical Events").

#### Configuring Wait Event Collection

To control whether to collect wait events, set the state of the
relevant instruments and consumers:

- The [`setup_instruments`](performance-schema-setup-instruments-table.md "29.12.2.3 The setup_instruments Table") table
  contains instruments with names that begin with
  `wait`. Use these instruments to enable or
  disable collection of individual wait event classes.
- The [`setup_consumers`](performance-schema-setup-consumers-table.md "29.12.2.2 The setup_consumers Table") table
  contains consumer values with names corresponding to the
  current and historical wait event table names. Use these
  consumers to filter collection of wait events.

Some wait instruments are enabled by default; others are
disabled. For example:

```sql
mysql> SELECT NAME, ENABLED, TIMED
       FROM performance_schema.setup_instruments
       WHERE NAME LIKE 'wait/io/file/innodb%';
+-------------------------------------------------+---------+-------+
| NAME                                            | ENABLED | TIMED |
+-------------------------------------------------+---------+-------+
| wait/io/file/innodb/innodb_tablespace_open_file | YES     | YES   |
| wait/io/file/innodb/innodb_data_file            | YES     | YES   |
| wait/io/file/innodb/innodb_log_file             | YES     | YES   |
| wait/io/file/innodb/innodb_temp_file            | YES     | YES   |
| wait/io/file/innodb/innodb_arch_file            | YES     | YES   |
| wait/io/file/innodb/innodb_clone_file           | YES     | YES   |
+-------------------------------------------------+---------+-------+
mysql> SELECT NAME, ENABLED, TIMED
       FROM performance_schema.setup_instruments
       WHERE NAME LIKE 'wait/io/socket/%';
+----------------------------------------+---------+-------+
| NAME                                   | ENABLED | TIMED |
+----------------------------------------+---------+-------+
| wait/io/socket/sql/server_tcpip_socket | NO      | NO    |
| wait/io/socket/sql/server_unix_socket  | NO      | NO    |
| wait/io/socket/sql/client_connection   | NO      | NO    |
+----------------------------------------+---------+-------+
```

The wait consumers are disabled by default:

```sql
mysql> SELECT *
       FROM performance_schema.setup_consumers
       WHERE NAME LIKE 'events_waits%';
+---------------------------+---------+
| NAME                      | ENABLED |
+---------------------------+---------+
| events_waits_current      | NO      |
| events_waits_history      | NO      |
| events_waits_history_long | NO      |
+---------------------------+---------+
```

To control wait event collection at server startup, use lines
like these in your `my.cnf` file:

- Enable:

  ```ini
  [mysqld]
  performance-schema-instrument='wait/%=ON'
  performance-schema-consumer-events-waits-current=ON
  performance-schema-consumer-events-waits-history=ON
  performance-schema-consumer-events-waits-history-long=ON
  ```
- Disable:

  ```ini
  [mysqld]
  performance-schema-instrument='wait/%=OFF'
  performance-schema-consumer-events-waits-current=OFF
  performance-schema-consumer-events-waits-history=OFF
  performance-schema-consumer-events-waits-history-long=OFF
  ```

To control wait event collection at runtime, update the
[`setup_instruments`](performance-schema-setup-instruments-table.md "29.12.2.3 The setup_instruments Table") and
[`setup_consumers`](performance-schema-setup-consumers-table.md "29.12.2.2 The setup_consumers Table") tables:

- Enable:

  ```sql
  UPDATE performance_schema.setup_instruments
  SET ENABLED = 'YES', TIMED = 'YES'
  WHERE NAME LIKE 'wait/%';

  UPDATE performance_schema.setup_consumers
  SET ENABLED = 'YES'
  WHERE NAME LIKE 'events_waits%';
  ```
- Disable:

  ```sql
  UPDATE performance_schema.setup_instruments
  SET ENABLED = 'NO', TIMED = 'NO'
  WHERE NAME LIKE 'wait/%';

  UPDATE performance_schema.setup_consumers
  SET ENABLED = 'NO'
  WHERE NAME LIKE 'events_waits%';
  ```

To collect only specific wait events, enable only the
corresponding wait instruments. To collect wait events only for
specific wait event tables, enable the wait instruments but only
the wait consumers corresponding to the desired tables.

For additional information about configuring event collection,
see [Section 29.3, “Performance Schema Startup Configuration”](performance-schema-startup-configuration.md "29.3 Performance Schema Startup Configuration"),
and [Section 29.4, “Performance Schema Runtime Configuration”](performance-schema-runtime-configuration.md "29.4 Performance Schema Runtime Configuration").
