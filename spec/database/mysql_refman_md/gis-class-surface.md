#### 13.4.2.6 Surface Class

A `Surface` is a two-dimensional geometry. It
is a noninstantiable class. Its only instantiable subclass is
`Polygon`.

Simple surfaces in three-dimensional space are isomorphic to
planar surfaces.

Polyhedral surfaces are formed by “stitching”
together simple surfaces along their boundaries, polyhedral
surfaces in three-dimensional space may not be planar as a
whole.

**`Surface`
Properties**

- A `Surface` is defined as a
  two-dimensional geometry.
- The OpenGIS specification defines a simple
  `Surface` as a geometry that consists of
  a single “patch” that is associated with a
  single exterior boundary and zero or more interior
  boundaries.
- The boundary of a simple `Surface` is the
  set of closed curves corresponding to its exterior and
  interior boundaries.
