## 1.1 About This Manual

This is the Reference Manual for the MySQL Database System,
version 8.0, through release 8.0.45.
Differences between minor versions of MySQL 8.0 are
noted in the present text with reference to release numbers
(8.0.*`x`*). For license
information, see the [Legal
Notices](preface.md#legalnotice "Legal Notices").

This manual is not intended for use with older versions of the
MySQL software due to the many functional and other differences
between MySQL 8.0 and previous versions. If you are
using an earlier release of the MySQL software, please refer to
the appropriate manual. For example,
[*MySQL 5.7 Reference Manual*](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/)
covers the 5.7 series of MySQL software releases.

If you are using MySQL 8.4, please refer to the
[MySQL 8.4 Reference
Manual](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.4/en/).

Because this manual serves as a reference, it does not provide
general instruction on SQL or relational database concepts. It
also does not teach you how to use your operating system or
command-line interpreter.

The MySQL Database Software is under constant development, and the
Reference Manual is updated frequently as well. The most recent
version of the manual is available online in searchable form at
<https://dev.mysql.com/doc/>. Other formats also are available
there, including downloadable HTML and PDF versions.

The source code for MySQL itself contains internal documentation
written using Doxygen. The generated Doxygen content is available
from <https://dev.mysql.com/doc/index-other.html>. It is also
possible to generate this content locally from a MySQL source
distribution using the instructions at
[Section 2.8.10, “Generating MySQL Doxygen Documentation Content”](source-installation-doxygen.md "2.8.10 Generating MySQL Doxygen Documentation Content").

If you have questions about using MySQL, join the
[MySQL Community
Slack](https://mysqlcommunity.slack.com/). If you have suggestions concerning additions or
corrections to the manual itself, please send them to the

### Typographical and Syntax Conventions

This manual uses certain typographical conventions:

- `Text in this style` is used for SQL
  statements; database, table, and column names; program listings
  and source code; and environment variables. Example: “To
  reload the grant tables, use the [`FLUSH
  PRIVILEGES`](flush.md#flush-privileges) statement.”
- **`Text in this style`** indicates input that
  you type in examples.
- **Text in this style** indicates the names of
  executable programs and scripts, examples being
  [**mysql**](mysql.md "6.5.1 mysql — The MySQL Command-Line Client") (the MySQL command-line client program)
  and [**mysqld**](mysqld.md "6.3.1 mysqld — The MySQL Server") (the MySQL server executable).
- *`Text in this style`* is used for
  variable input for which you should substitute a value of your
  own choosing.
- *Text in this style* is used for emphasis.
- **Text in this style** is used in
  table headings and to convey especially strong emphasis.
- `Text in this style` is used to indicate a
  program option that affects how the program is executed, or that
  supplies information that is needed for the program to function
  in a certain way. *Example*: “The
  `--host` option (short form `-h`)
  tells the [**mysql**](mysql.md "6.5.1 mysql — The MySQL Command-Line Client") client program the hostname
  or IP address of the MySQL server that it should connect
  to”.
- File names and directory names are written like this: “The
  global `my.cnf` file is located in the
  `/etc` directory.”
- Character sequences are written like this: “To specify a
  wildcard, use the ‘`%`’
  character.”

When commands or statements are prefixed by a prompt, we use these:

```terminal
$> type a command here
#> type a command as root here
C:\> type a command here (Windows only)
mysql> type a mysql statement here
```

Commands are issued in your command interpreter. On Unix, this is
typically a program such as **sh**,
**csh**, or **bash**. On Windows, the
equivalent program is **command.com** or
**cmd.exe**, typically run in a console window.
Statements prefixed by `mysql` are issued in the
[**mysql**](mysql.md "6.5.1 mysql — The MySQL Command-Line Client") command-line client.

Note

When you enter a command or statement shown in an example, do not
type the prompt shown in the example.

In some areas different systems may be distinguished from each other
to show that commands should be executed in two different
environments. For example, while working with replication the
commands might be prefixed with `source` and
`replica`:

```sql
source> type a mysql statement on the replication source here
replica> type a mysql statement on the replica here
```

Database, table, and column names must often be substituted into
statements. To indicate that such substitution is necessary, this
manual uses *`db_name`*,
*`tbl_name`*, and
*`col_name`*. For example, you might see a
statement like this:

```sql
mysql> SELECT col_name FROM db_name.tbl_name;
```

This means that if you were to enter a similar statement, you would
supply your own database, table, and column names, perhaps like
this:

```sql
mysql> SELECT author_name FROM biblio_db.author_list;
```

SQL keywords are not case-sensitive and may be written in any
lettercase. This manual uses uppercase.

In syntax descriptions, square brackets
(“`[`” and
“`]`”) indicate optional words or
clauses. For example, in the following statement, `IF
EXISTS` is optional:

```sql
DROP TABLE [IF EXISTS] tbl_name
```

When a syntax element consists of a number of alternatives, the
alternatives are separated by vertical bars
(“`|`”). When one member from a set of
choices *may* be chosen, the alternatives are
listed within square brackets (“`[`”
and “`]`”):

```sql
TRIM([[BOTH | LEADING | TRAILING] [remstr] FROM] str)
```

When one member from a set of choices *must* be
chosen, the alternatives are listed within braces
(“`{`” and
“`}`”):

```sql
{DESCRIBE | DESC} tbl_name [col_name | wild]
```

An ellipsis (`...`) indicates the omission of a
section of a statement, typically to provide a shorter version of
more complex syntax. For example,
[`SELECT ... INTO
OUTFILE`](select.md "15.2.13 SELECT Statement") is shorthand for the form of
[`SELECT`](select.md "15.2.13 SELECT Statement") statement that has an
`INTO OUTFILE` clause following other parts of the
statement.

An ellipsis can also indicate that the preceding syntax element of a
statement may be repeated. In the following example, multiple
*`reset_option`* values may be given, with
each of those after the first preceded by commas:

```sql
RESET reset_option [,reset_option] ...
```

Commands for setting shell variables are shown using Bourne shell
syntax. For example, the sequence to set the `CC`
environment variable and run the **configure**
command looks like this in Bourne shell syntax:

```terminal
$> CC=gcc ./configure
```

If you are using **csh** or **tcsh**,
you must issue commands somewhat differently:

```terminal
$> setenv CC gcc
$> ./configure
```

### Manual Authorship

The Reference Manual source files are written in DocBook XML
format. The HTML version and other formats are produced
automatically, primarily using the DocBook XSL stylesheets. For
