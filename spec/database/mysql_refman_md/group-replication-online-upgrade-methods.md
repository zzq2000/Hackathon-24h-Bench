#### 20.8.3.3 Group Replication Online Upgrade Methods

Choose one of the following methods of upgrading a Group
Replication group:

##### Rolling In-Group Upgrade

This method is supported provided that servers running a newer
version are not generating workload to the group while there
are still servers with an older version in it. In other words
servers with a newer version can join the group only as
secondaries. In this method there is only ever one group, and
each server instance is removed from the group, upgraded and
then rejoined to the group.

This method is well suited to single-primary groups. When the
group is operating in single-primary mode, if you require the
primary to remain the same throughout (except when it is being
upgraded itself), it should be the last member to be upgraded.
The primary cannot remain as the primary unless it is running
the lowest MySQL Server version in the group. After the
primary has been upgraded, you can use the
[`group_replication_set_as_primary()`](group-replication-functions-for-new-primary.md#function_group-replication-set-as-primary)
function to reappoint it as the primary. If you do not mind
which member is the primary, the members can be upgraded in
any order. The group elects a new primary whenever necessary
from among the members running the lowest MySQL Server
version, following the election policies described in
[Section 20.1.3.1, “Single-Primary Mode”](group-replication-single-primary-mode.md "20.1.3.1 Single-Primary Mode").

For groups operating in multi-primary mode, during a rolling
in-group upgrade the number of primaries is decreased, causing
a reduction in write availability. This is because if a member
joins a group when it is running a higher MySQL Server version
than the lowest version that the existing group members are
running, it automatically remains in read-only mode
([`super_read_only=ON`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_super_read_only)). Note
that members running MySQL 8.0.17 or higher take into account
the patch version of the release when checking this, but
members running MySQL 8.0.16 or lower, or MySQL 5.7, only take
into account the major version. When all members have been
upgraded to the same release, from MySQL 8.0.17, they all
change back to read-write mode automatically. For earlier
releases, you must set
[`super_read_only=OFF`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_super_read_only) manually
on each member that should function as a primary following the
upgrade.

For full information on version compatibility in a group and
how this influences the behavior of a group during an upgrade
process, see
[Section 20.8.1, “Combining Different Member Versions in a Group”](group-replication-online-upgrade-combining-versions.md "20.8.1 Combining Different Member Versions in a Group")
.

##### Rolling Migration Upgrade

In this method you remove members from the group, upgrade them
and then create a second group using the upgraded members. For
groups operating in multi-primary mode, during this process
the number of primaries is decreased, causing a reduction in
write availability. This does not impact groups operating in
single-primary mode.

Because the group running the older version is online while
you are upgrading the members, you need the group running the
newer version to catch up with any transactions executed while
the members were being upgraded. Therefore one of the servers
in the new group is configured as a replica of a primary from
the older group. This ensures that the new group catches up
with the older group. Because this method relies on an
asynchronous replication channel which is used to replicate
data from one group to another, it is supported under the same
assumptions and requirements of asynchronous source-replica
replication, see [Chapter 19, *Replication*](replication.md "Chapter 19 Replication"). For groups
operating in single-primary mode, the asynchronous replication
connection to the old group must send data to the primary in
the new group, for a multi-primary group the asynchronous
replication channel can connect to any primary.

The process is to:

- remove members from the original group running the older
  server version one by one, see
  [Section 20.8.3.2, “Upgrading a Group Replication Member”](group-replication-upgrading-member.md "20.8.3.2 Upgrading a Group Replication Member")
- upgrade the server version running on the member, see
  [Chapter 3, *Upgrading MySQL*](upgrading.md "Chapter 3 Upgrading MySQL"). You can either follow an
  in-place or provision approach to upgrading.
- create a new group with the upgraded members, see
  [Chapter 20, *Group Replication*](group-replication.md "Chapter 20 Group Replication"). In this case you need
  to configure a new group name on each member (because the
  old group is still running and using the old name),
  bootstrap an initial upgraded member, and then add the
  remaining upgraded members.
- set up an asynchronous replication channel between the old
  group and the new group, see
  [Section 19.1.3.4, “Setting Up Replication Using GTIDs”](replication-gtids-howto.md "19.1.3.4 Setting Up Replication Using GTIDs"). Configure the
  older primary to function as the asynchronous replication
  source server and the new group member as a GTID-based
  replica.

Before you can redirect your application to the new group, you
must ensure that the new group has a suitable number of
members, for example so that the group can handle the failure
of a member. Issue `SELECT * FROM
performance_schema.replication_group_members` and
compare the initial group size and the new group size. Wait
until all data from the old group is propagated to the new
group and then drop the asynchronous replication connection
and upgrade any missing members.

##### Rolling Duplication Upgrade

In this method you create a second group consisting of members
which are running the newer version, and the data missing from
the older group is replicated to the newer group. This assumes
that you have enough servers to run both groups
simultaneously. Due to the fact that during this process the
number of primaries is *not* decreased, for
groups operating in multi-primary mode there is no reduction
in write availability. This makes rolling duplication upgrade
well suited to groups operating in multi-primary mode. This
does not impact groups operating in single-primary mode.

Because the group running the older version is online while
you are provisioning the members in the new group, you need
the group running the newer version to catch up with any
transactions executed while the members were being
provisioned. Therefore one of the servers in the new group is
configured as a replica of a primary from the older group.
This ensures that the new group catches up with the older
group. Because this method relies on an asynchronous
replication channel which is used to replicate data from one
group to another, it is supported under the same assumptions
and requirements of asynchronous source-replica replication,
see [Chapter 19, *Replication*](replication.md "Chapter 19 Replication"). For groups operating in
single-primary mode, the asynchronous replication connection
to the old group must send data to the primary in the new
group, for a multi-primary group the asynchronous replication
channel can connect to any primary.

The process is to:

- deploy a suitable number of members so that the group
  running the newer version can handle failure of a member
- take a backup of the existing data from a member of the
  group
- use the backup from the older member to provision the
  members of the new group, see
  [Section 20.8.3.4, “Group Replication Upgrade with mysqlbackup”](group-replication-upgrade-with-mysqlbackup.md "20.8.3.4 Group Replication Upgrade with mysqlbackup")
  for one method.

  Note

  You must restore the backup to the same version of MySQL
  which the backup was taken from, and then perform an
  in-place upgrade. For instructions, see
  [Chapter 3, *Upgrading MySQL*](upgrading.md "Chapter 3 Upgrading MySQL").
- create a new group with the upgraded members, see
  [Chapter 20, *Group Replication*](group-replication.md "Chapter 20 Group Replication"). In this case you need
  to configure a new group name on each member (because the
  old group is still running and using the old name),
  bootstrap an initial upgraded member, and then add the
  remaining upgraded members.
- set up an asynchronous replication channel between the old
  group and the new group, see
  [Section 19.1.3.4, “Setting Up Replication Using GTIDs”](replication-gtids-howto.md "19.1.3.4 Setting Up Replication Using GTIDs"). Configure the
  older primary to function as the asynchronous replication
  source server and the new group member as a GTID-based
  replica.

Once the ongoing data missing from the newer group is small
enough to be quickly transferred, you must redirect write
operations to the new group. Wait until all data from the old
group is propagated to the new group and then drop the
asynchronous replication connection.
