### 7.5.3 Error Log Components

This section describes the characteristics of individual error log
components. For general information about configuring error
logging, see [Section 7.4.2, “The Error Log”](error-log.md "7.4.2 The Error Log").

A log component can be a filter or a sink:

- A filter processes log events, to add, remove, or modify event
  fields, or to delete events entirely. The resulting events
  pass to the next log component in the list of enabled
  components.
- A sink is a destination (writer) for log events. Typically, a
  sink processes log events into log messages that have a
  particular format and writes these messages to its associated
  output, such as a file or the system log. A sink may also
  write to the Performance Schema
  [`error_log`](performance-schema-error-log-table.md "29.12.21.2 The error_log Table") table; see
  [Section 29.12.21.2, “The error\_log Table”](performance-schema-error-log-table.md "29.12.21.2 The error_log Table"). Events
  pass unmodified to the next log component in the list of
  enabled components (that is, although a sink formats events to
  produce output messages, it does not modify events as they
  pass internally to the next component).

The [`log_error_services`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_log_error_services) system
variable value lists the enabled log components. Components not
named in the list are disabled. From MySQL 8.0.30,
[`log_error_services`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_log_error_services) also
implicitly loads error log components if they are not already
loaded. For more information, see
[Section 7.4.2.1, “Error Log Configuration”](error-log-configuration.md "7.4.2.1 Error Log Configuration").

The following sections describe individual log components, grouped
by component type:

- [Filter Error Log Components](error-log-components.md#error-log-filter-components "Filter Error Log Components")
- [Sink Error Log Components](error-log-components.md#error-log-sink-components "Sink Error Log Components")

Component descriptions include these types of information:

- The component name and intended purpose.
- Whether the component is built in or must be loaded. For a
  loadable component, the description specifies the URN to use
  if explicitly loading or unloading the component with the
  [`INSTALL COMPONENT`](install-component.md "15.7.4.3 INSTALL COMPONENT Statement") and
  [`UNINSTALL COMPONENT`](uninstall-component.md "15.7.4.5 UNINSTALL COMPONENT Statement") statements.
  Implicitly loading error log components requires only the
  component name. For more information, see
  [Section 7.4.2.1, “Error Log Configuration”](error-log-configuration.md "7.4.2.1 Error Log Configuration").
- Whether the component can be listed multiple times in the
  [`log_error_services`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_log_error_services) value.
- For a sink component, the destination to which the component
  writes output.
- For a sink component, whether it supports an interface to the
  Performance Schema [`error_log`](performance-schema-error-log-table.md "29.12.21.2 The error_log Table")
  table.

#### Filter Error Log Components

Error log filter components implement filtering of error log
events. If no filter component is enabled, no filtering occurs.

Any enabled filter component affects log events only for
components listed later in the
[`log_error_services`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_log_error_services) value. In
particular, for any log sink component listed in
[`log_error_services`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_log_error_services) earlier than
any filter component, no log event filtering occurs.

##### The log\_filter\_internal Component

- Purpose: Implements filtering based on log event priority
  and error code, in combination with the
  [`log_error_verbosity`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_log_error_verbosity) and
  [`log_error_suppression_list`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_log_error_suppression_list)
  system variables. See
  [Section 7.4.2.5, “Priority-Based Error Log Filtering (log\_filter\_internal)”](error-log-priority-based-filtering.md "7.4.2.5 Priority-Based Error Log Filtering (log_filter_internal)").
- URN: This component is built in and need not be loaded.
- Multiple uses permitted: No.

If `log_filter_internal` is disabled,
[`log_error_verbosity`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_log_error_verbosity) and
[`log_error_suppression_list`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_log_error_suppression_list) have
no effect.

##### The log\_filter\_dragnet Component

- Purpose: Implements filtering based on the rules defined by
  the
  [`dragnet.log_error_filter_rules`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_dragnet.log_error_filter_rules)
  system variable setting. See
  [Section 7.4.2.6, “Rule-Based Error Log Filtering (log\_filter\_dragnet)”](error-log-rule-based-filtering.md "7.4.2.6 Rule-Based Error Log Filtering (log_filter_dragnet)").
- URN: `file://component_log_filter_dragnet`
- Multiple uses permitted: No.

#### Sink Error Log Components

Error log sink components are writers that implement error log
output. If no sink component is enabled, no log output occurs.

Some sink component descriptions refer to the default error log
destination. This is the console or a file and is indicated by
the value of the [`log_error`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_log_error)
system variable, determined as described in
[Section 7.4.2.2, “Default Error Log Destination Configuration”](error-log-destination-configuration.md "7.4.2.2 Default Error Log Destination Configuration").

##### The log\_sink\_internal Component

- Purpose: Implements traditional error log message output
  format.
- URN: This component is built in and need not be loaded.
- Multiple uses permitted: No.
- Output destination: Writes to the default error log
  destination.
- Performance Schema support: Writes to the
  [`error_log`](performance-schema-error-log-table.md "29.12.21.2 The error_log Table") table. Provides a
  parser for reading error log files created by previous
  server instances.

##### The log\_sink\_json Component

- Purpose: Implements JSON-format error logging. See
  [Section 7.4.2.7, “Error Logging in JSON Format”](error-log-json.md "7.4.2.7 Error Logging in JSON Format").
- URN: `file://component_log_sink_json`
- Multiple uses permitted: Yes.
- Output destination: This sink determines its output
  destination based on the default error log destination,
  which is given by the
  [`log_error`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_log_error) system variable:

  - If [`log_error`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_log_error) names a
    file, the sink bases output file naming on that file
    name, plus a numbered
    `.NN.json`
    suffix, with *`NN`* starting at
    00. For example, if
    [`log_error`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_log_error) is
    *`file_name`*, successive
    instances of `log_sink_json` named in
    the [`log_error_services`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_log_error_services)
    value write to
    `file_name.00.json`,
    `file_name.01.json`,
    and so forth.
  - If [`log_error`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_log_error) is
    `stderr`, the sink writes to the
    console. If `log_sink_json` is named
    multiple times in the
    [`log_error_services`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_log_error_services)
    value, they all write to the console, which is likely
    not useful.
- Performance Schema support: Writes to the
  [`error_log`](performance-schema-error-log-table.md "29.12.21.2 The error_log Table") table. Provides a
  parser for reading error log files created by previous
  server instances.

##### The log\_sink\_syseventlog Component

- Purpose: Implements error logging to the system log. This is
  the Event Log on Windows, and `syslog` on
  Unix and Unix-like systems. See
  [Section 7.4.2.8, “Error Logging to the System Log”](error-log-syslog.md "7.4.2.8 Error Logging to the System Log").
- URN:
  `file://component_log_sink_syseventlog`
- Multiple uses permitted: No.
- Output destination: Writes to the system log. Does not use
  the default error log destination.
- Performance Schema support: Does not write to the
  [`error_log`](performance-schema-error-log-table.md "29.12.21.2 The error_log Table") table. Does not
  provide a parser for reading error log files created by
  previous server instances.

##### The log\_sink\_test Component

- Purpose: Intended for internal use in writing test cases,
  not for production use.
- URN: `file://component_log_sink_test`

Sink properties such as whether multiple uses are permitted and
the output destination are not specified for
`log_sink_test` because, as mentioned, it is
for internal use. As such, its behavior is subject to change at
any time.
