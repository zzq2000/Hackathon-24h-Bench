This section describes how to configure the different types of
replication available in MySQL and includes the setup and
configuration required for a replication environment, including
step-by-step instructions for creating a new replication
environment. The major components of this section are:

- For a guide to setting up two or more servers for replication
  using binary log file positions,
  [Section 19.1.2, “Setting Up Binary Log File Position Based Replication”](replication-howto.md "19.1.2 Setting Up Binary Log File Position Based Replication"), deals with the
  configuration of the servers and provides methods for copying
  data between the source and replicas.
- For a guide to setting up two or more servers for replication
  using GTID transactions, [Section 19.1.3, “Replication with Global Transaction Identifiers”](replication-gtids.md "19.1.3 Replication with Global Transaction Identifiers"),
  deals with the configuration of the servers.
- Events in the binary log are recorded using a number of formats.
  These are referred to as statement-based replication (SBR) or
  row-based replication (RBR). A third type, mixed-format
  replication (MIXED), uses SBR or RBR replication automatically
  to take advantage of the benefits of both SBR and RBR formats
  when appropriate. The different formats are discussed in
  [Section 19.2.1, “Replication Formats”](replication-formats.md "19.2.1 Replication Formats").
- Detailed information on the different configuration options and
  variables that apply to replication is provided in
  [Section 19.1.6, “Replication and Binary Logging Options and Variables”](replication-options.md "19.1.6 Replication and Binary Logging Options and Variables").
- Once started, the replication process should require little
  administration or monitoring. However, for advice on common
  tasks that you may want to execute, see
  [Section 19.1.7, “Common Replication Administration Tasks”](replication-administration.md "19.1.7 Common Replication Administration Tasks").
