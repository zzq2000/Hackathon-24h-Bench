### 10.3.3 SPATIAL Index Optimization

MySQL permits creation of `SPATIAL` indexes on
`NOT NULL` geometry-valued columns (see
[Section 13.4.10, “Creating Spatial Indexes”](creating-spatial-indexes.md "13.4.10 Creating Spatial Indexes")). The optimizer
checks the `SRID` attribute for indexed columns
to determine which spatial reference system (SRS) to use for
comparisons, and uses calculations appropriate to the SRS.
(Prior to MySQL 8.0, the optimizer performs
comparisons of `SPATIAL` index values using
Cartesian calculations; the results of such operations are
undefined if the column contains values with non-Cartesian
SRIDs.)

For comparisons to work properly, each column in a
`SPATIAL` index must be SRID-restricted. That
is, the column definition must include an explicit
`SRID` attribute, and all column values must
have the same SRID.

The optimizer considers `SPATIAL` indexes only
for SRID-restricted columns:

- Indexes on columns restricted to a Cartesian SRID enable
  Cartesian bounding box computations.
- Indexes on columns restricted to a geographic SRID enable
  geographic bounding box computations.

The optimizer ignores `SPATIAL` indexes on
columns that have no `SRID` attribute (and thus
are not SRID-restricted). MySQL still maintains such indexes, as
follows:

- They are updated for table modifications
  ([`INSERT`](insert.md "15.2.7 INSERT Statement"),
  [`UPDATE`](update.md "15.2.17 UPDATE Statement"),
  [`DELETE`](delete.md "15.2.2 DELETE Statement"), and so forth).
  Updates occur as though the index was Cartesian, even though
  the column might contain a mix of Cartesian and geographical
  values.
- They exist only for backward compatibility (for example, the
  ability to perform a dump in MySQL 5.7 and restore in MySQL
  8.0). Because `SPATIAL` indexes on columns
  that are not SRID-restricted are of no use to the optimizer,
  each such column should be modified:

  - Verify that all values within the column have the same
    SRID. To determine the SRIDs contained in a geometry
    column *`col_name`*, use the
    following query:

    ```sql
    SELECT DISTINCT ST_SRID(col_name) FROM tbl_name;
    ```

    If the query returns more than one row, the column
    contains a mix of SRIDs. In that case, modify its
    contents so all values have the same SRID.
  - Redefine the column to have an explicit
    `SRID` attribute.
  - Recreate the `SPATIAL` index.
