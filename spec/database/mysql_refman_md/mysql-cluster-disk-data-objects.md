#### 25.6.11.1 NDB Cluster Disk Data Objects

NDB Cluster Disk Data storage is implemented using the following
objects:

- Tablespace: Acts as
  containers for other Disk Data objects. A tablespace
  contains one or more data files and one or more undo log
  file groups.
- Data file: Stores
  column data. A data file is assigned directly to a
  tablespace.
- Undo log file:
  Contains undo information required for rolling back
  transactions. Assigned to an undo log file group.
- log file group:
  Contains one or more undo log files. Assigned to a
  tablespace.

Undo log files and data files are actual files in the file
system of each data node; by default they are placed in
`ndb_node_id_fs` in
the *`DataDir`* specified in the NDB
Cluster `config.ini` file, and where
*`node_id`* is the data node's node
ID. It is possible to place these elsewhere by specifying either
an absolute or relative path as part of the filename when
creating the undo log or data file. Statements that create these
files are shown later in this section.

Undo log files are used only by Disk Data tables, and are not
needed or used by `NDB` tables that are stored
in memory only.

NDB Cluster tablespaces and log file groups are not implemented
as files.

Although not all Disk Data objects are implemented as files,
they all share the same namespace. This means that
*each Disk Data object* must be uniquely
named (and not merely each Disk Data object of a given type).
For example, you cannot have a tablespace and a log file group
both named `dd1`.

Assuming that you have already set up an NDB Cluster with all
nodes (including management and SQL nodes), the basic steps for
creating an NDB Cluster table on disk are as follows:

1. Create a log file group, and assign one or more undo log
   files to it (an undo log file is also sometimes referred to
   as an undofile).
2. Create a tablespace; assign the log file group, as well as
   one or more data files, to the tablespace.
3. Create a Disk Data table that uses this tablespace for data
   storage.

Each of these tasks can be accomplished using SQL statements in
the [**mysql**](mysql.md "6.5.1 mysql — The MySQL Command-Line Client") client or other MySQL client
application, as shown in the example that follows.

1. We create a log file group named `lg_1`
   using [`CREATE LOGFILE GROUP`](create-logfile-group.md "15.1.16 CREATE LOGFILE GROUP Statement").
   This log file group is to be made up of two undo log files,
   which we name `undo_1.log` and
   `undo_2.log`, whose initial sizes are 16
   MB and 12 MB, respectively. (The default initial size for an
   undo log file is 128 MB.) Optionally, you can also specify a
   size for the log file group's undo buffer, or permit it
   to assume the default value of 8 MB. In this example, we set
   the UNDO buffer's size at 2 MB. A log file group must
   be created with an undo log file; so we add
   `undo_1.log` to `lg_1`
   in this [`CREATE LOGFILE GROUP`](create-logfile-group.md "15.1.16 CREATE LOGFILE GROUP Statement")
   statement:

   ```sql
   CREATE LOGFILE GROUP lg_1
       ADD UNDOFILE 'undo_1.log'
       INITIAL_SIZE 16M
       UNDO_BUFFER_SIZE 2M
       ENGINE NDBCLUSTER;
   ```

   To add `undo_2.log` to the log file
   group, use the following [`ALTER LOGFILE
   GROUP`](alter-logfile-group.md "15.1.6 ALTER LOGFILE GROUP Statement") statement:

   ```sql
   ALTER LOGFILE GROUP lg_1
       ADD UNDOFILE 'undo_2.log'
       INITIAL_SIZE 12M
       ENGINE NDBCLUSTER;
   ```

   Some items of note:

   - The `.log` file extension used here
     is not required. We employ it merely to make the log
     files easily recognizable.
   - Every [`CREATE LOGFILE
     GROUP`](create-logfile-group.md "15.1.16 CREATE LOGFILE GROUP Statement") and [`ALTER LOGFILE
     GROUP`](alter-logfile-group.md "15.1.6 ALTER LOGFILE GROUP Statement") statement must include an
     `ENGINE` option. The only permitted
     values for this option are
     [`NDBCLUSTER`](mysql-cluster.md "Chapter 25 MySQL NDB Cluster 8.0") and
     [`NDB`](mysql-cluster.md "Chapter 25 MySQL NDB Cluster 8.0").

     Important

     There can exist at most one log file group in the same
     NDB Cluster at any given time.
   - When you add an undo log file to a log file group using
     `ADD UNDOFILE
     'filename'`, a file
     with the name *`filename`* is
     created in the
     `ndb_node_id_fs`
     directory within the
     [`DataDir`](mysql-cluster-ndbd-definition.md#ndbparam-ndbd-datadir) of each
     data node in the cluster, where
     *`node_id`* is the node ID of the
     data node. Each undo log file is of the size specified
     in the SQL statement. For example, if an NDB Cluster has
     4 data nodes, then the [`ALTER
     LOGFILE GROUP`](alter-logfile-group.md "15.1.6 ALTER LOGFILE GROUP Statement") statement just shown creates 4
     undo log files, 1 each on in the data directory of each
     of the 4 data nodes; each of these files is named
     `undo_2.log` and each file is 12 MB
     in size.
   - `UNDO_BUFFER_SIZE` is limited by the
     amount of system memory available.
   - See [Section 15.1.16, “CREATE LOGFILE GROUP Statement”](create-logfile-group.md "15.1.16 CREATE LOGFILE GROUP Statement"), and
     [Section 15.1.6, “ALTER LOGFILE GROUP Statement”](alter-logfile-group.md "15.1.6 ALTER LOGFILE GROUP Statement"), for more
     information about these statements.
2. Now we can create a tablespace—an abstract container
   for files used by Disk Data tables to store data. A
   tablespace is associated with a particular log file group;
   when creating a new tablespace, you must specify the log
   file group it uses for undo logging. You must also specify
   at least one data file; you can add more data files to the
   tablespace after the tablespace is created. It is also
   possible to drop data files from a tablespace (see example
   later in this section).

   Assume that we wish to create a tablespace named
   `ts_1` which uses `lg_1`
   as its log file group. We want the tablespace to contain two
   data files, named `data_1.dat` and
   `data_2.dat`, whose initial sizes are 32
   MB and 48 MB, respectively. (The default value for
   `INITIAL_SIZE` is 128 MB.) We can do this
   using two SQL statements, as shown here:

   ```sql
   CREATE TABLESPACE ts_1
       ADD DATAFILE 'data_1.dat'
       USE LOGFILE GROUP lg_1
       INITIAL_SIZE 32M
       ENGINE NDBCLUSTER;

   ALTER TABLESPACE ts_1
       ADD DATAFILE 'data_2.dat'
       INITIAL_SIZE 48M;
   ```

   The [`CREATE TABLESPACE`](create-tablespace.md "15.1.21 CREATE TABLESPACE Statement")
   statement creates a tablespace `ts_1` with
   the data file `data_1.dat`, and
   associates `ts_1` with log file group
   `lg_1`. The [`ALTER
   TABLESPACE`](alter-tablespace.md "15.1.10 ALTER TABLESPACE Statement") adds the second data file
   (`data_2.dat`).

   Some items of note:

   - As is the case with the `.log` file
     extension used in this example for undo log files, there
     is no special significance for the
     `.dat` file extension; it is used
     merely for easy recognition.
   - When you add a data file to a tablespace using
     `ADD DATAFILE
     'filename'`, a file
     with the name *`filename`* is
     created in the
     `ndb_node_id_fs`
     directory within the
     [`DataDir`](mysql-cluster-ndbd-definition.md#ndbparam-ndbd-datadir) of each
     data node in the cluster, where
     *`node_id`* is the node ID of the
     data node. Each data file is of the size specified in
     the SQL statement. For example, if an NDB Cluster has 4
     data nodes, then the [`ALTER
     TABLESPACE`](alter-tablespace.md "15.1.10 ALTER TABLESPACE Statement") statement just shown creates 4 data
     files, 1 each in the data directory of each of the 4
     data nodes; each of these files is named
     `data_2.dat` and each file is 48 MB
     in size.
   - `NDB` reserves 4% of each tablespace
     for use during data node restarts. This space is not
     available for storing data.
   - [`CREATE TABLESPACE`](create-tablespace.md "15.1.21 CREATE TABLESPACE Statement")
     statements must contain an `ENGINE`
     clause; only tables using the same storage engine as the
     tablespace can be created in the tablespace. For
     [`ALTER TABLESPACE`](alter-tablespace.md "15.1.10 ALTER TABLESPACE Statement"), an
     `ENGINE` clause is accepted but is
     deprecated and subject to removal in a future release.
     For `NDB` tablespaces, the only
     permitted values for this option are
     `NDBCLUSTER` and
     `NDB`.
   - In NDB 8.0.20 and later, allocation of extents is
     performed in round-robin fashion among all data files
     used by a given tablespace.
   - For more information about the
     [`CREATE TABLESPACE`](create-tablespace.md "15.1.21 CREATE TABLESPACE Statement") and
     [`ALTER TABLESPACE`](alter-tablespace.md "15.1.10 ALTER TABLESPACE Statement")
     statements, see [Section 15.1.21, “CREATE TABLESPACE Statement”](create-tablespace.md "15.1.21 CREATE TABLESPACE Statement"), and
     [Section 15.1.10, “ALTER TABLESPACE Statement”](alter-tablespace.md "15.1.10 ALTER TABLESPACE Statement").
3. Now it is possible to create a table whose unindexed columns
   are stored on disk using files in tablespace
   `ts_1`:

   ```sql
   CREATE TABLE dt_1 (
       member_id INT UNSIGNED NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
       last_name VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
       first_name VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
       dob DATE NOT NULL,
       joined DATE NOT NULL,
       INDEX(last_name, first_name)
       )
       TABLESPACE ts_1 STORAGE DISK
       ENGINE NDBCLUSTER;
   ```

   `TABLESPACE ts_1 STORAGE DISK` tells the
   [`NDB`](mysql-cluster.md "Chapter 25 MySQL NDB Cluster 8.0") storage engine to use
   tablespace `ts_1` for data storage on disk.

   Once table `ts_1` has been created as
   shown, you can perform
   [`INSERT`](insert.md "15.2.7 INSERT Statement"),
   [`SELECT`](select.md "15.2.13 SELECT Statement"),
   [`UPDATE`](update.md "15.2.17 UPDATE Statement"), and
   [`DELETE`](delete.md "15.2.2 DELETE Statement") statements on it just
   as you would with any other MySQL table.

   It is also possible to specify whether an individual column
   is stored on disk or in memory by using a
   `STORAGE` clause as part of the
   column's definition in a [`CREATE
   TABLE`](create-table.md "15.1.20 CREATE TABLE Statement") or [`ALTER
   TABLE`](alter-table.md "15.1.9 ALTER TABLE Statement") statement. `STORAGE DISK`
   causes the column to be stored on disk, and `STORAGE
   MEMORY` causes in-memory storage to be used. See
   [Section 15.1.20, “CREATE TABLE Statement”](create-table.md "15.1.20 CREATE TABLE Statement"), for more information.

You can obtain information about the `NDB` disk
data files and undo log files just created by querying the
[`FILES`](information-schema-files-table.md "28.3.15 The INFORMATION_SCHEMA FILES Table") table in the
`INFORMATION_SCHEMA` database, as shown here:

```sql
mysql> SELECT
              FILE_NAME AS File, FILE_TYPE AS Type,
              TABLESPACE_NAME AS Tablespace, TABLE_NAME AS Name,
              LOGFILE_GROUP_NAME AS 'File group',
              FREE_EXTENTS AS Free, TOTAL_EXTENTS AS Total
          FROM INFORMATION_SCHEMA.FILES
          WHERE ENGINE='ndbcluster';
+--------------+----------+------------+------+------------+------+---------+
| File         | Type     | Tablespace | Name | File group | Free | Total   |
+--------------+----------+------------+------+------------+------+---------+
| ./undo_1.log | UNDO LOG | lg_1       | NULL | lg_1       |    0 | 4194304 |
| ./undo_2.log | UNDO LOG | lg_1       | NULL | lg_1       |    0 | 3145728 |
| ./data_1.dat | DATAFILE | ts_1       | NULL | lg_1       |   32 |      32 |
| ./data_2.dat | DATAFILE | ts_1       | NULL | lg_1       |   48 |      48 |
+--------------+----------+------------+------+------------+------+---------+
4 rows in set (0.00 sec)
```

For more information and examples, see
[Section 28.3.15, “The INFORMATION\_SCHEMA FILES Table”](information-schema-files-table.md "28.3.15 The INFORMATION_SCHEMA FILES Table").

**Indexing of columns implicitly stored on disk.**
For table `dt_1` as defined in the example
just shown, only the `dob` and
`joined` columns are stored on disk. This is
because there are indexes on the `id`,
`last_name`, and
`first_name` columns, and so data belonging
to these columns is stored in RAM. Only nonindexed columns can
be held on disk; indexes and indexed column data continue to
be stored in memory. This tradeoff between the use of indexes
and conservation of RAM is something you must keep in mind as
you design Disk Data tables.

You cannot add an index to a column that has been explicitly
declared `STORAGE DISK`, without first changing
its storage type to `MEMORY`; any attempt to do
so fails with an error. A column which
*implicitly* uses disk storage can be
indexed; when this is done, the column's storage type is
changed to `MEMORY` automatically. By
“implicitly”, we mean a column whose storage type
is not declared, but which is which inherited from the parent
table. In the following CREATE TABLE statement (using the
tablespace `ts_1` defined previously), columns
`c2` and `c3` use disk storage
implicitly:

```sql
mysql> CREATE TABLE ti (
    ->     c1 INT PRIMARY KEY,
    ->     c2 INT,
    ->     c3 INT,
    ->     c4 INT
    -> )
    ->     STORAGE DISK
    ->     TABLESPACE ts_1
    ->     ENGINE NDBCLUSTER;
Query OK, 0 rows affected (1.31 sec)
```

Because `c2`, `c3`, and
`c4` are themselves not declared with
`STORAGE DISK`, it is possible to index them.
Here, we add indexes to `c2` and
`c3`, using, respectively, `CREATE
INDEX` and `ALTER TABLE`:

```sql
mysql> CREATE INDEX i1 ON ti(c2);
Query OK, 0 rows affected (2.72 sec)
Records: 0  Duplicates: 0  Warnings: 0

mysql> ALTER TABLE ti ADD INDEX i2(c3);
Query OK, 0 rows affected (0.92 sec)
Records: 0  Duplicates: 0  Warnings: 0
```

[`SHOW CREATE TABLE`](show-create-table.md "15.7.7.10 SHOW CREATE TABLE Statement") confirms that
the indexes were added.

```sql
mysql> SHOW CREATE TABLE ti\G
*************************** 1. row ***************************
       Table: ti
Create Table: CREATE TABLE `ti` (
  `c1` int(11) NOT NULL,
  `c2` int(11) DEFAULT NULL,
  `c3` int(11) DEFAULT NULL,
  `c4` int(11) DEFAULT NULL,
  PRIMARY KEY (`c1`),
  KEY `i1` (`c2`),
  KEY `i2` (`c3`)
) /*!50100 TABLESPACE `ts_1` STORAGE DISK */ ENGINE=ndbcluster DEFAULT CHARSET=utf8mb4 COLLATE=utf8mb4_0900_ai_ci
1 row in set (0.00 sec)
```

You can see using [**ndb\_desc**](mysql-cluster-programs-ndb-desc.md "25.5.9 ndb_desc — Describe NDB Tables") that the indexed
columns (emphasized text) now use in-memory rather than on-disk
storage:

```

**Performance note.**
The performance of a cluster using Disk Data storage is
greatly improved if Disk Data files are kept on a separate
physical disk from the data node file system. This must be
done for each data node in the cluster to derive any
noticeable benefit.

You can use absolute and relative file system paths with
`ADD UNDOFILE` and `ADD
DATAFILE`; relative paths are calculated with respect
to the data node's data directory.

A log file group, a tablespace, and any Disk Data tables using
these must be created in a particular order. This is also true
for dropping these objects, subject to the following
constraints:

- A log file group cannot be dropped as long as any
  tablespaces use it.
- A tablespace cannot be dropped as long as it contains any
  data files.
- You cannot drop any data files from a tablespace as long as
  there remain any tables which are using the tablespace.
- It is not possible to drop files created in association with
  a different tablespace other than the one with which the
  files were created.

For example, to drop all the objects created so far in this
section, you can use the following statements:

```sql
mysql> DROP TABLE dt_1;

mysql> ALTER TABLESPACE ts_1
    -> DROP DATAFILE 'data_2.dat'
    -> ENGINE NDBCLUSTER;

mysql> ALTER TABLESPACE ts_1
    -> DROP DATAFILE 'data_1.dat'
    -> ENGINE NDBCLUSTER;

mysql> DROP TABLESPACE ts_1
    -> ENGINE NDBCLUSTER;

mysql> DROP LOGFILE GROUP lg_1
    -> ENGINE NDBCLUSTER;
```

These statements must be performed in the order shown, except
that the two `ALTER TABLESPACE ... DROP
DATAFILE` statements may be executed in either order.
