### 10.4.6 Limits on Table Size

The effective maximum table size for MySQL databases is usually
determined by operating system constraints on file sizes, not by
MySQL internal limits. For up-to-date information operating
system file size limits, refer to the documentation specific to
your operating system.

Windows users, please note that FAT and VFAT (FAT32) are
*not* considered suitable for production use
with MySQL. Use NTFS instead.

If you encounter a full-table error, there are several reasons
why it might have occurred:

- The disk might be full.
- You are using `InnoDB` tables and have run
  out of room in an `InnoDB` tablespace file.
  The maximum tablespace size is also the maximum size for a
  table. For tablespace size limits, see
  [Section 17.22, “InnoDB Limits”](innodb-limits.md "17.22 InnoDB Limits").

  Generally, partitioning of tables into multiple tablespace
  files is recommended for tables larger than 1TB in size.
- You have hit an operating system file size limit. For
  example, you are using `MyISAM` tables on
  an operating system that supports files only up to 2GB in
  size and you have hit this limit for the data file or index
  file.
- You are using a `MyISAM` table and the
  space required for the table exceeds what is permitted by
  the internal pointer size. `MyISAM` permits
  data and index files to grow up to 256TB by default, but
  this limit can be changed up to the maximum permissible size
  of 65,536TB (2567 − 1
  bytes).

  If you need a `MyISAM` table that is larger
  than the default limit and your operating system supports
  large files, the [`CREATE TABLE`](create-table.md "15.1.20 CREATE TABLE Statement")
  statement supports `AVG_ROW_LENGTH` and
  `MAX_ROWS` options. See
  [Section 15.1.20, “CREATE TABLE Statement”](create-table.md "15.1.20 CREATE TABLE Statement"). The server uses these
  options to determine how large a table to permit.

  If the pointer size is too small for an existing table, you
  can change the options with [`ALTER
  TABLE`](alter-table.md "15.1.9 ALTER TABLE Statement") to increase a table's maximum
  permissible size. See [Section 15.1.9, “ALTER TABLE Statement”](alter-table.md "15.1.9 ALTER TABLE Statement").

  ```sql
  ALTER TABLE tbl_name MAX_ROWS=1000000000 AVG_ROW_LENGTH=nnn;
  ```

  You have to specify `AVG_ROW_LENGTH` only
  for tables with [`BLOB`](blob.md "13.3.4 The BLOB and TEXT Types") or
  [`TEXT`](blob.md "13.3.4 The BLOB and TEXT Types") columns; in this case,
  MySQL cannot optimize the space required based only on the
  number of rows.

  To change the default size limit for
  `MyISAM` tables, set the
  [`myisam_data_pointer_size`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_myisam_data_pointer_size),
  which sets the number of bytes used for internal row
  pointers. The value is used to set the pointer size for new
  tables if you do not specify the `MAX_ROWS`
  option. The value of
  [`myisam_data_pointer_size`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_myisam_data_pointer_size)
  can be from 2 to 7. For example, for tables that use the
  dynamic storage format, a value of 4 permits tables up to
  4GB; a value of 6 permits tables up to 256TB. Tables that
  use the fixed storage format have a larger maximum data
  length. For storage format characteristics, see
  [Section 18.2.3, “MyISAM Table Storage Formats”](myisam-table-formats.md "18.2.3 MyISAM Table Storage Formats").

  You can check the maximum data and index sizes by using this
  statement:

  ```sql
  SHOW TABLE STATUS FROM db_name LIKE 'tbl_name';
  ```

  You also can use [**myisamchk -dv
  /path/to/table-index-file**](myisamchk.md "6.6.4 myisamchk — MyISAM Table-Maintenance Utility"). See
  [Section 15.7.7, “SHOW Statements”](show.md "15.7.7 SHOW Statements"), or [Section 6.6.4, “myisamchk — MyISAM Table-Maintenance Utility”](myisamchk.md "6.6.4 myisamchk — MyISAM Table-Maintenance Utility").

  Other ways to work around file-size limits for
  `MyISAM` tables are as follows:

  - If your large table is read only, you can use
    [**myisampack**](myisampack.md "6.6.6 myisampack — Generate Compressed, Read-Only MyISAM Tables") to compress it.
    [**myisampack**](myisampack.md "6.6.6 myisampack — Generate Compressed, Read-Only MyISAM Tables") usually compresses a table
    by at least 50%, so you can have, in effect, much bigger
    tables. [**myisampack**](myisampack.md "6.6.6 myisampack — Generate Compressed, Read-Only MyISAM Tables") also can merge
    multiple tables into a single table. See
    [Section 6.6.6, “myisampack — Generate Compressed, Read-Only MyISAM Tables”](myisampack.md "6.6.6 myisampack — Generate Compressed, Read-Only MyISAM Tables").
  - MySQL includes a `MERGE` library that
    enables you to handle a collection of
    `MyISAM` tables that have identical
    structure as a single `MERGE` table.
    See [Section 18.7, “The MERGE Storage Engine”](merge-storage-engine.md "18.7 The MERGE Storage Engine").
- You are using the `MEMORY`
  (`HEAP`) storage engine; in this case you
  need to increase the value of the
  [`max_heap_table_size`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_max_heap_table_size) system
  variable. See [Section 7.1.8, “Server System Variables”](server-system-variables.md "7.1.8 Server System Variables").
