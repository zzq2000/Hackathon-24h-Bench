## 32.5 MySQL Enterprise Firewall Overview

MySQL Enterprise Edition includes MySQL Enterprise Firewall, an application-level firewall that enables
database administrators to permit or deny SQL statement execution
based on matching against allowlists of accepted statement
patterns. This helps harden MySQL Server against attacks such as
SQL injection or attempts to exploit applications by using them
outside of their legitimate query workload characteristics.

Each MySQL account registered with the firewall has its own
statement allowlist, enabling protection to be tailored per
account. For a given account, the firewall can operate in
recording or protecting mode, for training in the accepted
statement patterns or protection against unacceptable statements.

For more information, see [Section 8.4.7, “MySQL Enterprise Firewall”](firewall.md "8.4.7 MySQL Enterprise Firewall").
