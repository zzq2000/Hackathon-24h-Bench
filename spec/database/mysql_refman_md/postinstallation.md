This section discusses tasks that you should perform after
installing MySQL:

- If necessary, initialize the data directory and create the MySQL
  grant tables. For some MySQL installation methods, data
  directory initialization may be done for you automatically:

  - Windows installation operations performed by MySQL Installer.
  - Installation on Linux using a server RPM or Debian
    distribution from Oracle.
  - Installation using the native packaging system on many
    platforms, including Debian Linux, Ubuntu Linux, Gentoo
    Linux, and others.
  - Installation on macOS using a DMG distribution.

  For other platforms and installation types, you must initialize
  the data directory manually. These include installation from
  generic binary and source distributions on Unix and Unix-like
  system, and installation from a ZIP Archive package on Windows.
  For instructions, see
  [Section 2.9.1, “Initializing the Data Directory”](data-directory-initialization.md "2.9.1 Initializing the Data Directory").
- Start the server and make sure that it can be accessed. For
  instructions, see [Section 2.9.2, “Starting the Server”](starting-server.md "2.9.2 Starting the Server"), and
  [Section 2.9.3, “Testing the Server”](testing-server.md "2.9.3 Testing the Server").
- Assign passwords to the initial `root` account
  in the grant tables, if that was not already done during data
  directory initialization. Passwords prevent unauthorized access
  to the MySQL server. For instructions, see
  [Section 2.9.4, “Securing the Initial MySQL Account”](default-privileges.md "2.9.4 Securing the Initial MySQL Account").
- Optionally, arrange for the server to start and stop
  automatically when your system starts and stops. For
  instructions, see [Section 2.9.5, “Starting and Stopping MySQL Automatically”](automatic-start.md "2.9.5 Starting and Stopping MySQL Automatically").
- Optionally, populate time zone tables to enable recognition of
  named time zones. For instructions, see
  [Section 7.1.15, “MySQL Server Time Zone Support”](time-zone-support.md "7.1.15 MySQL Server Time Zone Support").

When you are ready to create additional user accounts, you can find
information on the MySQL access control system and account
management in [Section 8.2, “Access Control and Account Management”](access-control.md "8.2 Access Control and Account Management").
