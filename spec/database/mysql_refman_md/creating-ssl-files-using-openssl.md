#### 8.3.3.2 Creating SSL Certificates and Keys Using openssl

This section describes how to use the **openssl**
command to set up SSL certificate and key files for use by MySQL
servers and clients. The first example shows a simplified
procedure such as you might use from the command line. The
second shows a script that contains more detail. The first two
examples are intended for use on Unix and both use the
**openssl** command that is part of OpenSSL. The
third example describes how to set up SSL files on Windows.

Note

There are easier alternatives to generating the files required
for SSL than the procedure described here: Let the server
autogenerate them or use the
[**mysql\_ssl\_rsa\_setup**](mysql-ssl-rsa-setup.md "6.4.3 mysql_ssl_rsa_setup — Create SSL/RSA Files") program (deprecated as
of 8.0.34). See
[Section 8.3.3.1, “Creating SSL and RSA Certificates and Keys using MySQL”](creating-ssl-rsa-files-using-mysql.md "8.3.3.1 Creating SSL and RSA Certificates and Keys using MySQL").

Important

Whatever method you use to generate the certificate and key
files, the Common Name value used for the server and client
certificates/keys must each differ from the Common Name value
used for the CA certificate. Otherwise, the certificate and
key files do not work for servers compiled using OpenSSL. A
typical error in this case is:

```ini
ERROR 2026 (HY000): SSL connection error:
error:00000001:lib(0):func(0):reason(1)
```

Important

If a client connecting to a MySQL server instance uses an SSL
certificate with the `extendedKeyUsage`
extension (an X.509 v3 extension), the extended key usage must
include client authentication (`clientAuth`).
If the SSL certificate is only specified for server
authentication (`serverAuth`) and other
non-client certificate purposes, certificate verification
fails and the client connection to the MySQL server instance
fails. There is no `extendedKeyUsage`
extension in SSL certificates created using the
**openssl** command following the instructions
in this topic. If you use your own client certificate created
in another way, ensure any `extendedKeyUsage`
extension includes client authentication.

- [Example 2: Creating SSL Files Using a Script on Unix](creating-ssl-files-using-openssl.md#creating-ssl-files-using-openssl-unix-script "Example 2: Creating SSL Files Using a Script on Unix")
- [Example 3: Creating SSL Files on Windows](creating-ssl-files-using-openssl.md#creating-ssl-files-using-openssl-windows "Example 3: Creating SSL Files on Windows")

##### Example 1: Creating SSL Files from the Command Line on Unix

The following example shows a set of commands to create MySQL
server and client certificate and key files. You must respond
to several prompts by the **openssl** commands.
To generate test files, you can press Enter to all prompts. To
generate files for production use, you should provide nonempty
responses.

```terminal
# Create clean environment
rm -rf newcerts
mkdir newcerts && cd newcerts

# Create CA certificate
openssl genrsa 2048 > ca-key.pem
openssl req -new -x509 -nodes -days 3600 \
        -key ca-key.pem -out ca.pem

# Create server certificate, remove passphrase, and sign it
# server-cert.pem = public key, server-key.pem = private key
openssl req -newkey rsa:2048 -days 3600 \
        -nodes -keyout server-key.pem -out server-req.pem
openssl rsa -in server-key.pem -out server-key.pem
openssl x509 -req -in server-req.pem -days 3600 \
        -CA ca.pem -CAkey ca-key.pem -set_serial 01 -out server-cert.pem

# Create client certificate, remove passphrase, and sign it
# client-cert.pem = public key, client-key.pem = private key
openssl req -newkey rsa:2048 -days 3600 \
        -nodes -keyout client-key.pem -out client-req.pem
openssl rsa -in client-key.pem -out client-key.pem
openssl x509 -req -in client-req.pem -days 3600 \
        -CA ca.pem -CAkey ca-key.pem -set_serial 01 -out client-cert.pem
```

After generating the certificates, verify them:

```terminal
openssl verify -CAfile ca.pem server-cert.pem client-cert.pem
```

You should see a response like this:

```ini
server-cert.pem: OK
client-cert.pem: OK
```

To see the contents of a certificate (for example, to check
the range of dates over which a certificate is valid), invoke
**openssl** like this:

```terminal
openssl x509 -text -in ca.pem
openssl x509 -text -in server-cert.pem
openssl x509 -text -in client-cert.pem
```

Now you have a set of files that can be used as follows:

- `ca.pem`: Use this to set the
  [`ssl_ca`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_ssl_ca) system variable on
  the server side and the
  [`--ssl-ca`](connection-options.md#option_general_ssl-ca) option on the
  client side. (The CA certificate, if used, must be the
  same on both sides.)
- `server-cert.pem`,
  `server-key.pem`: Use these to set the
  [`ssl_cert`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_ssl_cert) and
  [`ssl_key`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_ssl_key) system variables
  on the server side.
- `client-cert.pem`,
  `client-key.pem`: Use these as the
  arguments to the
  [`--ssl-cert`](connection-options.md#option_general_ssl-cert) and
  [`--ssl-key`](connection-options.md#option_general_ssl-key) options on the
  client side.

For additional usage instructions, see
[Section 8.3.1, “Configuring MySQL to Use Encrypted Connections”](using-encrypted-connections.md "8.3.1 Configuring MySQL to Use Encrypted Connections").

##### Example 2: Creating SSL Files Using a Script on Unix

Here is an example script that shows how to set up SSL
certificate and key files for MySQL. After executing the
script, use the files for SSL connections as described in
[Section 8.3.1, “Configuring MySQL to Use Encrypted Connections”](using-encrypted-connections.md "8.3.1 Configuring MySQL to Use Encrypted Connections").

```terminal
DIR=`pwd`/openssl
PRIV=$DIR/private

mkdir $DIR $PRIV $DIR/newcerts
cp /usr/share/ssl/openssl.cnf $DIR
replace ./demoCA $DIR -- $DIR/openssl.cnf

# Create necessary files: $database, $serial and $new_certs_dir
# directory (optional)

touch $DIR/index.txt
echo "01" > $DIR/serial

#
# Generation of Certificate Authority(CA)

##### Example 3: Creating SSL Files on Windows

Download OpenSSL for Windows if it is not installed on your
system. An overview of available packages can be seen here:

```ini
http://www.slproweb.com/products/Win32OpenSSL.html
```

Choose the Win32 OpenSSL Light or Win64 OpenSSL Light package,
depending on your architecture (32-bit or 64-bit). The default
installation location is `C:\OpenSSL-Win32`
or `C:\OpenSSL-Win64`, depending on which
package you downloaded. The following instructions assume a
default location of `C:\OpenSSL-Win32`.
Modify this as necessary if you are using the 64-bit package.

If a message occurs during setup indicating
`'...critical component is missing: Microsoft Visual
C++ 2019 Redistributables'`, cancel the setup and
download one of the following packages as well, again
depending on your architecture (32-bit or 64-bit):

- Visual C++ 2008 Redistributables (x86), available at:

  ```ini
  http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?familyid=9B2DA534-3E03-4391-8A4D-074B9F2BC1BF
  ```
- Visual C++ 2008 Redistributables (x64), available at:

  ```ini
  http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?familyid=bd2a6171-e2d6-4230-b809-9a8d7548c1b6
  ```

After installing the additional package, restart the OpenSSL
setup procedure.

During installation, leave the default
`C:\OpenSSL-Win32` as the install path, and
also leave the default option `'Copy OpenSSL DLL files
to the Windows system directory'` selected.

When the installation has finished, add
`C:\OpenSSL-Win32\bin` to the Windows
System Path variable of your server (depending on your version
of Windows, the following path-setting instructions might
differ slightly):

1. On the Windows desktop, right-click the My
   Computer icon, and select
   Properties.
2. Select the Advanced tab from
   the System Properties menu that
   appears, and click the Environment
   Variables button.
3. Under System Variables, select
   Path, then click the
   Edit button. The Edit
   System Variable dialogue should appear.
4. Add `';C:\OpenSSL-Win32\bin'` to the end
   (notice the semicolon).
5. Press OK 3 times.
6. Check that OpenSSL was correctly integrated into the Path
   variable by opening a new command console
   (**Start>Run>cmd.exe**) and verifying
   that OpenSSL is available:

   ```terminal
   Microsoft Windows [Version ...]
   Copyright (c) 2006 Microsoft Corporation. All rights reserved.

   C:\Windows\system32>cd \

   C:\>openssl
   OpenSSL> exit <<< If you see the OpenSSL prompt, installation was successful.

   C:\>
   ```

After OpenSSL has been installed, use instructions similar to
those from Example 1 (shown earlier in this section), with the
following changes:

- Change the following Unix commands:

  ```terminal
  # Create clean environment
  rm -rf newcerts
  mkdir newcerts && cd newcerts
  ```

  On Windows, use these commands instead:

  ```terminal
  # Create clean environment
  md c:\newcerts
  cd c:\newcerts
  ```
- When a `'\'` character is shown at the
  end of a command line, this `'\'`
  character must be removed and the command lines entered
  all on a single line.

After generating the certificate and key files, to use them
for SSL connections, see
[Section 8.3.1, “Configuring MySQL to Use Encrypted Connections”](using-encrypted-connections.md "8.3.1 Configuring MySQL to Use Encrypted Connections").
