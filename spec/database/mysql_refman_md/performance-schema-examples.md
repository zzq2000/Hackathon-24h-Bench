## 29.19 Using the Performance Schema to Diagnose Problems

[29.19.1 Query Profiling Using Performance Schema](performance-schema-query-profiling.md)

[29.19.2 Obtaining Parent Event Information](performance-schema-obtaining-parent-events.md)

The Performance Schema is a tool to help a DBA do performance
tuning by taking real measurements instead of “wild
guesses.” This section demonstrates some ways to use the
Performance Schema for this purpose. The discussion here relies on
the use of event filtering, which is described in
[Section 29.4.2, “Performance Schema Event Filtering”](performance-schema-filtering.md "29.4.2 Performance Schema Event Filtering").

The following example provides one methodology that you can use to
analyze a repeatable problem, such as investigating a performance
bottleneck. To begin, you should have a repeatable use case where
performance is deemed “too slow” and needs
optimization, and you should enable all instrumentation (no
pre-filtering at all).

1. Run the use case.
2. Using the Performance Schema tables, analyze the root cause of
   the performance problem. This analysis relies heavily on
   post-filtering.
3. For problem areas that are ruled out, disable the
   corresponding instruments. For example, if analysis shows that
   the issue is not related to file I/O in a particular storage
   engine, disable the file I/O instruments for that engine. Then
   truncate the history and summary tables to remove previously
   collected events.
4. Repeat the process at step 1.

   With each iteration, the Performance Schema output,
   particularly the
   [`events_waits_history_long`](performance-schema-events-waits-history-long-table.md "29.12.4.3 The events_waits_history_long Table") table,
   contains less and less “noise” caused by
   nonsignificant instruments, and given that this table has a
   fixed size, contains more and more data relevant to the
   analysis of the problem at hand.

   With each iteration, investigation should lead closer and
   closer to the root cause of the problem, as the
   “signal/noise” ratio improves, making analysis
   easier.
5. Once a root cause of performance bottleneck is identified,
   take the appropriate corrective action, such as:

   - Tune the server parameters (cache sizes, memory, and so
     forth).
   - Tune a query by writing it differently,
   - Tune the database schema (tables, indexes, and so forth).
   - Tune the code (this applies to storage engine or server
     developers only).
6. Start again at step 1, to see the effects of the changes on
   performance.

The `mutex_instances.LOCKED_BY_THREAD_ID` and
`rwlock_instances.WRITE_LOCKED_BY_THREAD_ID`
columns are extremely important for investigating performance
bottlenecks or deadlocks. This is made possible by Performance
Schema instrumentation as follows:

1. Suppose that thread 1 is stuck waiting for a mutex.
2. You can determine what the thread is waiting for:

   ```sql
   SELECT * FROM performance_schema.events_waits_current
   WHERE THREAD_ID = thread_1;
   ```

   Say the query result identifies that the thread is waiting for
   mutex A, found in
   `events_waits_current.OBJECT_INSTANCE_BEGIN`.
3. You can determine which thread is holding mutex A:

   ```sql
   SELECT * FROM performance_schema.mutex_instances
   WHERE OBJECT_INSTANCE_BEGIN = mutex_A;
   ```

   Say the query result identifies that it is thread 2 holding
   mutex A, as found in
   `mutex_instances.LOCKED_BY_THREAD_ID`.
4. You can see what thread 2 is doing:

   ```sql
   SELECT * FROM performance_schema.events_waits_current
   WHERE THREAD_ID = thread_2;
   ```
