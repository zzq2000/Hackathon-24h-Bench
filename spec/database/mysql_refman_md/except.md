### 15.2.4 EXCEPT Clause

```sql
query_expression_body EXCEPT [ALL | DISTINCT] query_expression_body
    [EXCEPT [ALL | DISTINCT] query_expression_body]
    [...]

query_expression_body:
    See Section 15.2.14, “Set Operations with UNION, INTERSECT, and EXCEPT”
```

[`EXCEPT`](except.md "15.2.4 EXCEPT Clause") limits the result from the
first query block to those rows which are (also) not found in the
second. As with [`UNION`](union.md "15.2.18 UNION Clause") and
[`INTERSECT`](intersect.md "15.2.8 INTERSECT Clause"), either query block can
make use of any of [`SELECT`](select.md "15.2.13 SELECT Statement"),
[`TABLE`](table.md "15.2.16 TABLE Statement"), or
[`VALUES`](values.md "15.2.19 VALUES Statement"). An example using the tables
`a`, `b`, and
`c` defined in [Section 15.2.8, “INTERSECT Clause”](intersect.md "15.2.8 INTERSECT Clause"), is
shown here:

```sql
mysql> TABLE a EXCEPT TABLE b;
+------+------+
| m    | n    |
+------+------+
|    2 |    3 |
+------+------+
1 row in set (0.00 sec)

mysql> TABLE a EXCEPT TABLE c;
+------+------+
| m    | n    |
+------+------+
|    1 |    2 |
|    2 |    3 |
+------+------+
2 rows in set (0.00 sec)

mysql> TABLE b EXCEPT TABLE c;
+------+------+
| m    | n    |
+------+------+
|    1 |    2 |
+------+------+
1 row in set (0.00 sec)
```

As with [`UNION`](union.md "15.2.18 UNION Clause") and
[`INTERSECT`](intersect.md "15.2.8 INTERSECT Clause"), if neither
`DISTINCT` nor `ALL` is
specified, the default is `DISTINCT`.

`DISTINCT` removes duplicates found on either
side of the relation, as shown here:

```sql
mysql> TABLE c EXCEPT DISTINCT TABLE a;
+------+------+
| m    | n    |
+------+------+
|    1 |    3 |
+------+------+
1 row in set (0.00 sec)

mysql> TABLE c EXCEPT ALL TABLE a;
+------+------+
| m    | n    |
+------+------+
|    1 |    3 |
|    1 |    3 |
+------+------+
2 rows in set (0.00 sec)
```

(The first statement has the same effect as `TABLE c
EXCEPT TABLE a`.)

Unlike `UNION` or `INTERSECT`,
`EXCEPT` is *not*
commutative—that is, the result depends on the order of the
operands, as shown here:

```sql
mysql> TABLE a EXCEPT TABLE c;
+------+------+
| m    | n    |
+------+------+
|    1 |    2 |
|    2 |    3 |
+------+------+
2 rows in set (0.00 sec)

mysql> TABLE c EXCEPT TABLE a;
+------+------+
| m    | n    |
+------+------+
|    1 |    3 |
+------+------+
1 row in set (0.00 sec)
```

As with `UNION`, the result sets to be compared
must have the same number of columns. Result set column types are
also determined as for `UNION`.

`EXCEPT` was added in MySQL 8.0.31.
