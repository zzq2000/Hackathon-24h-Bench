#### 15.7.4.3 INSTALL COMPONENT Statement

```sql
INSTALL COMPONENT component_name  [, component_name ...
     [SET variable = expr [, variable = expr] ...]

  variable: {
    {GLOBAL | @@GLOBAL.} [component_prefix.]system_var_name
  | {PERSIST | @@PERSIST.} [component_prefix.]system_var_name
}
```

This statement installs one or more components, which become
active immediately. A component provides services that are
available to the server and other components; see
[Section 7.5, “MySQL Components”](components.md "7.5 MySQL Components"). [`INSTALL
COMPONENT`](install-component.md "15.7.4.3 INSTALL COMPONENT Statement") requires the
[`INSERT`](privileges-provided.md#priv_insert) privilege for the
`mysql.component` system table because it adds
a row to that table to register the component.

Example:

```sql
INSTALL COMPONENT 'file://component1', 'file://component2';
```

A component is named using a URN that begins with
`file://` and indicates the base name of the
library file that implements the component, located in the
directory named by the
[`plugin_dir`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_plugin_dir) system variable.
Component names do not include any platform-dependent file name
suffix such as `.so` or
`.dll`. (These naming details are subject to
change because component name interpretation is itself performed
by a service and the component infrastructure makes it possible
to replace the default service implementation with alternative
implementations.)

[`INSTALL COMPONENT`](install-component.md "15.7.4.3 INSTALL COMPONENT Statement") (from 8.0.33)
permits setting the values of component system variables when
you install one or more components. The `SET`
clause enables you to specify variable values precisely when
they are needed, without the inconvenience or limitations
associated with other forms of assignment. Specifically, you can
also set component variables with these alternatives:

- At server startup using options on the command line or in an
  option file, but doing so involves a server restart. The
  values do not take effect until you install the component.
  You can specify an invalid variable name for a component on
  the command line without triggering an error.
- Dynamically while the server is running by means of the
  [`SET`](set.md "13.3.6 The SET Type") statement, which enables
  you to modify operation of the server without having to stop
  and restart it. Setting a read-only variable is not
  permitted.

The optional `SET` clause applies a value, or
values, only to the component specified in the
[`INSTALL COMPONENT`](install-component.md "15.7.4.3 INSTALL COMPONENT Statement") statement,
rather than to all subsequent installations of that component.
`SET GLOBAL|PERSIST` works for all types of
variables, including read-only variables, without having to
restart the server. A component system variable that you set
using [`INSTALL COMPONENT`](install-component.md "15.7.4.3 INSTALL COMPONENT Statement") takes
precedence over any conflicting value coming from the command
line or an option file.

Example:

```sql
INSTALL COMPONENT 'file://component1', 'file://component2'
    SET GLOBAL component1.var1 = 12 + 3, PERSIST component2.var2 = 'strings';
```

Omitting `PERSIST` or `GLOBAL`
is equivalent to specifying `GLOBAL`.

Specifying `PERSIST` for any variable in
`SET` silently executes `SET
PERSIST_ONLY` immediately after
[`INSTALL COMPONENT`](install-component.md "15.7.4.3 INSTALL COMPONENT Statement") loads the
components, but before updating the
`mysql.component` table. If `SET
PERSIST_ONLY` fails, then the server unloads all of the
previously loaded new components without persisting anything to
`mysql.component`.

The `SET` clause accepts only valid variable
names of the component being installed and emits an error
message for all invalid names. Subqueries, stored functions, and
aggregate functions are not permitted as part of the value
expression. If you install a single component, it is not
necessary to prefix the variable name with the component name.

Note

While specifying a variable value using the
`SET` clause is similar to that of the
command line—it is available immediately at variable
registration—there is a distinct difference in how the
`SET` clause handles *invalid
numerical* values for boolean variables. For
example, if you set a boolean variable to 11
(`component1.boolvar = 11`), you see the
following behavior:

- `SET` clause yields true
- Command line yields false (11 is neither ON nor 1)

If any error occurs, the statement fails and has no effect. For
example, this happens if a component name is erroneous, a named
component does not exist or is already installed, or component
initialization fails.

A loader service handles component loading, which includes
adding installed components to the
`mysql.component` system table that serves as a
registry. For subsequent server restarts, any components listed
in `mysql.component` are loaded by the loader
service during the startup sequence. This occurs even if the
server is started with the
[`--skip-grant-tables`](server-options.md#option_mysqld_skip-grant-tables) option.

If a component depends on services not present in the registry
and you attempt to install the component without also installing
the component or components that provide the services on which
it depends, an error occurs:

```none
ERROR 3527 (HY000): Cannot satisfy dependency for service 'component_a'
required by component 'component_b'.
```

To avoid this problem, either install all components in the same
statement, or install the dependent component after installing
any components on which it depends.

Note

For keyring components, do not use
[`INSTALL COMPONENT`](install-component.md "15.7.4.3 INSTALL COMPONENT Statement"). Instead,
configure keyring component loading using a manifest file. See
[Section 8.4.4.2, “Keyring Component Installation”](keyring-component-installation.md "8.4.4.2 Keyring Component Installation").
