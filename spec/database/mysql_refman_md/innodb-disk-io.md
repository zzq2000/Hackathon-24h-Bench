### 17.11.1 InnoDB Disk I/O

`InnoDB` uses asynchronous disk I/O where
possible, by creating a number of threads to handle I/O
operations, while permitting other database operations to proceed
while the I/O is still in progress. On Linux and Windows
platforms, `InnoDB` uses the available OS and
library functions to perform “native” asynchronous
I/O. On other platforms, `InnoDB` still uses I/O
threads, but the threads may actually wait for I/O requests to
complete; this technique is known as “simulated”
asynchronous I/O.

#### Read-Ahead

If `InnoDB` can determine there is a high
probability that data might be needed soon, it performs
read-ahead operations to bring that data into the buffer pool so
that it is available in memory. Making a few large read requests
for contiguous data can be more efficient than making several
small, spread-out requests. There are two read-ahead heuristics
in `InnoDB`:

- In sequential read-ahead, if `InnoDB`
  notices that the access pattern to a segment in the
  tablespace is sequential, it posts in advance a batch of
  reads of database pages to the I/O system.
- In random read-ahead, if `InnoDB` notices
  that some area in a tablespace seems to be in the process of
  being fully read into the buffer pool, it posts the
  remaining reads to the I/O system.

For information about configuring read-ahead heuristics, see
[Section 17.8.3.4, “Configuring InnoDB Buffer Pool Prefetching (Read-Ahead)”](innodb-performance-read_ahead.md "17.8.3.4 Configuring InnoDB Buffer Pool Prefetching (Read-Ahead)").

#### Doublewrite Buffer

`InnoDB` uses a novel file flush technique
involving a structure called the
[doublewrite
buffer](glossary.md#glos_doublewrite_buffer "doublewrite buffer"), which is enabled by default in most cases
([`innodb_doublewrite=ON`](innodb-parameters.md#sysvar_innodb_doublewrite)). It
adds safety to recovery following an unexpected exit or power
outage, and improves performance on most varieties of Unix by
reducing the need for `fsync()` operations.

Before writing pages to a data file, `InnoDB`
first writes them to a storage area called the doublewrite
buffer. Only after the write and the flush to the doublewrite
buffer has completed does `InnoDB` write the
pages to their proper positions in the data file. If there is an
operating system, storage subsystem, or unexpected
[**mysqld**](mysqld.md "6.3.1 mysqld — The MySQL Server") process exit in the middle of a page
write (causing a [torn page](glossary.md#glos_torn_page "torn page")
condition), `InnoDB` can later find a good copy
of the page from the doublewrite buffer during recovery.

For more information about the doublewrite buffer, see
[Section 17.6.4, “Doublewrite Buffer”](innodb-doublewrite-buffer.md "17.6.4 Doublewrite Buffer").
