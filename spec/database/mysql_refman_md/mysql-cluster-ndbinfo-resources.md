#### 25.6.16.51 The ndbinfo resources Table

This table provides information about data node resource
availability and usage.

These resources are sometimes known as
super-pools.

The `resources` table contains the following
columns:

- `node_id`

  The unique node ID of this data node.
- `resource_name`

  Name of the resource; see text.
- `reserved`

  The amount reserved for this resource, as a number of 32KB
  pages.
- `used`

  The amount actually used by this resource, as a number of
  32KB pages.
- `max`

  The maximum amount (number of 32KB pages) of this resource
  that is available to this data node.

##### Notes

The `resource_name` can be any one of the names
shown in the following table:

- `RESERVED`: Reserved by the system; cannot
  be overridden.
- `TRANSACTION_MEMORY`: Memory allocated for
  transactions on this data node. In NDB 8.0.19 and later this
  can be controlled using the
  [`TransactionMemory`](mysql-cluster-ndbd-definition.md#ndbparam-ndbd-transactionmemory)
  configuration parameter.
- `DISK_OPERATIONS`: If a log file group is
  allocated, the size of the undo log buffer is used to set
  the size of this resource. This resource is used only to
  allocate the undo log buffer for an undo log file group;
  there can only be one such group. Overallocation occurs as
  needed by [`CREATE LOGFILE
  GROUP`](create-logfile-group.md "15.1.16 CREATE LOGFILE GROUP Statement").
- `DISK_RECORDS`: Records allocated for Disk
  Data operations.
- `DATA_MEMORY`: Used for main memory tuples,
  indexes, and hash indexes. Sum of DataMemory and
  IndexMemory, plus 8 pages of 32 KB each if IndexMemory has
  been set. Cannot be overallocated.
- `JOBBUFFER`: Used for allocating job
  buffers by the NDB scheduler; cannot be overallocated. This
  is approximately 2 MB per thread plus a 1 MB buffer in both
  directions for all threads that can communicate. For large
  configurations this consume several GB.
- `FILE_BUFFERS`: Used by the redo log
  handler in the [`DBLQH`](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/ndb-internals/en/ndb-internals-kernel-blocks-dblqh.html)
  kernel block; cannot be overallocated. Size is
  [`NoOfFragmentLogParts`](mysql-cluster-ndbd-definition.md#ndbparam-ndbmtd-nooffragmentlogparts)
  \* [`RedoBuffer`](mysql-cluster-ndbd-definition.md#ndbparam-ndbd-redobuffer), plus 1
  MB per log file part.
- `TRANSPORTER_BUFFERS`: Used for send
  buffers by [**ndbmtd**](mysql-cluster-programs-ndbmtd.md "25.5.3 ndbmtd — The NDB Cluster Data Node Daemon (Multi-Threaded)"); the sum of
  [`TotalSendBufferMemory`](mysql-cluster-ndbd-definition.md#ndbparam-ndbd-totalsendbuffermemory)
  and
  [`ExtraSendBufferMemory`](mysql-cluster-ndbd-definition.md#ndbparam-ndbd-extrasendbuffermemory).
  This resource that can be overallocated by up to 25 percent.
  `TotalSendBufferMemory` is calculated by
  summing the send buffer memory per node, the default value
  of which is 2 MB. Thus, in a system having four data nodes
  and eight API nodes, the data nodes have 12 \* 2 MB send
  buffer memory. `ExtraSendBufferMemory` is
  used by [**ndbmtd**](mysql-cluster-programs-ndbmtd.md "25.5.3 ndbmtd — The NDB Cluster Data Node Daemon (Multi-Threaded)") and amounts to 2 MB extra
  memory per thread. Thus, with 4 LDM threads, 2 TC threads, 1
  main thread, 1 replication thread, and 2 receive threads,
  `ExtraSendBufferMemory` is 10 \* 2 MB.
  Overallocation of this resource can be performed by setting
  the
  [`SharedGlobalMemory`](mysql-cluster-ndbd-definition.md#ndbparam-ndbd-sharedglobalmemory)
  data node configuration parameter.
- `DISK_PAGE_BUFFER`: Used for the disk page
  buffer; determined by the
  [`DiskPageBufferMemory`](mysql-cluster-ndbd-definition.md#ndbparam-ndbd-diskpagebuffermemory)
  configuration parameter. Cannot be overallocated.
- `QUERY_MEMORY`: Used by the
  [`DBSPJ`](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/ndb-internals/en/ndb-internals-kernel-blocks-dbspj.html) kernel block.
- `SCHEMA_TRANS_MEMORY`: Minimum is 2 MB; can
  be overallocated to use any remaining available memory.
