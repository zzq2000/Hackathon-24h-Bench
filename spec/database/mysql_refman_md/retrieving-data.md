The [`SELECT`](select.md "15.2.13 SELECT Statement") statement is used to
pull information from a table. The general form of the statement
is:

```sql
SELECT what_to_select
FROM which_table
WHERE conditions_to_satisfy;
```

*`what_to_select`* indicates what you
want to see. This can be a list of columns, or
`*` to indicate “all columns.”
*`which_table`* indicates the table from
which you want to retrieve data. The `WHERE`
clause is optional. If it is present,
*`conditions_to_satisfy`* specifies one
or more conditions that rows must satisfy to qualify for
retrieval.
