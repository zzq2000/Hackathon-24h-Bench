#### 19.1.7.1 Checking Replication Status

The most common task when managing a replication process is to
ensure that replication is taking place and that there have been
no errors between the replica and the source.

The [`SHOW REPLICA STATUS`](show-replica-status.md "15.7.7.35 SHOW REPLICA STATUS Statement")
statement, which you must execute on each replica, provides
information about the configuration and status of the connection
between the replica server and the source server. From MySQL
8.0.22, [`SHOW SLAVE STATUS`](show-slave-status.md "15.7.7.36 SHOW SLAVE | REPLICA STATUS Statement") is
deprecated, and [`SHOW REPLICA
STATUS`](show-replica-status.md "15.7.7.35 SHOW REPLICA STATUS Statement") is available to use instead. The Performance
Schema has replication tables that provide this information in a
more accessible form. See
[Section 29.12.11, “Performance Schema Replication Tables”](performance-schema-replication-tables.md "29.12.11 Performance Schema Replication Tables").

The replication heartbeat information shown in the Performance
Schema replication tables lets you check that the replication
connection is active even if the source has not sent events to
the replica recently. The source sends a heartbeat signal to a
replica if there are no updates to, and no unsent events in, the
binary log for a longer period than the heartbeat interval. The
`MASTER_HEARTBEAT_PERIOD` setting on the source
(set by the [`CHANGE MASTER TO`](change-master-to.md "15.4.2.1 CHANGE MASTER TO Statement")
statement) specifies the frequency of the heartbeat, which
defaults to half of the connection timeout interval for the
replica (specified by the system variable
[`replica_net_timeout`](replication-options-replica.md#sysvar_replica_net_timeout) or
[`slave_net_timeout`](replication-options-replica.md#sysvar_slave_net_timeout)). The
[`replication_connection_status`](performance-schema-replication-connection-status-table.md "29.12.11.11 The replication_connection_status Table")
Performance Schema table shows when the most recent heartbeat
signal was received by a replica, and how many heartbeat signals
it has received.

If you are using the [`SHOW REPLICA
STATUS`](show-replica-status.md "15.7.7.35 SHOW REPLICA STATUS Statement") statement to check on the status of an
individual replica, the statement provides the following
information:

The key fields from the status report to examine are:

- `Replica_IO_State`: The current status of
  the replica. See [Section 10.14.5, “Replication I/O (Receiver) Thread States”](replica-io-thread-states.md "10.14.5 Replication I/O (Receiver) Thread States"),
  and [Section 10.14.6, “Replication SQL Thread States”](replica-sql-thread-states.md "10.14.6 Replication SQL Thread States"), for more
  information.
- `Replica_IO_Running`: Whether the I/O
  (receiver) thread for reading the source's binary log is
  running. Normally, you want this to be
  `Yes` unless you have not yet started
  replication or have explicitly stopped it with
  [`STOP REPLICA`](stop-replica.md "15.4.2.8 STOP REPLICA Statement").
- `Replica_SQL_Running`: Whether the SQL
  thread for executing events in the relay log is running. As
  with the I/O thread, this should normally be
  `Yes`.
- `Last_IO_Error`,
  `Last_SQL_Error`: The last errors
  registered by the I/O (receiver) and SQL (applier) threads
  when processing the relay log. Ideally these should be
  blank, indicating no errors.
- `Seconds_Behind_Source`: The number of
  seconds that the replication SQL (applier) thread is behind
  processing the source binary log. A high number (or an
  increasing one) can indicate that the replica is unable to
  handle events from the source in a timely fashion.

  A value of 0 for `Seconds_Behind_Source`
  can usually be interpreted as meaning that the replica has
  caught up with the source, but there are some cases where
  this is not strictly true. For example, this can occur if
  the network connection between source and replica is broken
  but the replication I/O (receiver) thread has not yet
  noticed this; that is, the time period set by
  [`replica_net_timeout`](replication-options-replica.md#sysvar_replica_net_timeout) or
  [`slave_net_timeout`](replication-options-replica.md#sysvar_slave_net_timeout) has not
  yet elapsed.

  It is also possible that transient values for
  `Seconds_Behind_Source` may not reflect the
  situation accurately. When the replication SQL (applier)
  thread has caught up on I/O,
  `Seconds_Behind_Source` displays 0; but
  when the replication I/O (receiver) thread is still queuing
  up a new event, `Seconds_Behind_Source` may
  show a large value until the replication applier thread
  finishes executing the new event. This is especially likely
  when the events have old timestamps; in such cases, if you
  execute [`SHOW REPLICA STATUS`](show-replica-status.md "15.7.7.35 SHOW REPLICA STATUS Statement")
  several times in a relatively short period, you may see this
  value change back and forth repeatedly between 0 and a
  relatively large value.

Several pairs of fields provide information about the progress
of the replica in reading events from the source binary log and
processing them in the relay log:

- (`Master_Log_file`,
  `Read_Master_Log_Pos`): Coordinates in the
  source binary log indicating how far the replication I/O
  (receiver) thread has read events from that log.
- (`Relay_Master_Log_File`,
  `Exec_Master_Log_Pos`): Coordinates in the
  source binary log indicating how far the replication SQL
  (applier) thread has executed events received from that log.
- (`Relay_Log_File`,
  `Relay_Log_Pos`): Coordinates in the
  replica relay log indicating how far the replication SQL
  (applier) thread has executed the relay log. These
  correspond to the preceding coordinates, but are expressed
  in replica relay log coordinates rather than source binary
  log coordinates.

On the source, you can check the status of connected replicas
using [`SHOW PROCESSLIST`](show-processlist.md "15.7.7.29 SHOW PROCESSLIST Statement") to examine
the list of running processes. Replica connections have
`Binlog Dump` in the `Command`
field:

```sql
mysql> SHOW PROCESSLIST \G;
*************************** 4. row ***************************
     Id: 10
   User: root
   Host: replica1:58371
     db: NULL
Command: Binlog Dump
   Time: 777
  State: Has sent all binlog to slave; waiting for binlog to be updated
   Info: NULL
```

Because it is the replica that drives the replication process,
very little information is available in this report.

For replicas that were started with the
[`--report-host`](replication-options-replica.md#sysvar_report_host) option and are
connected to the source, the [`SHOW
REPLICAS`](show-replicas.md "15.7.7.33 SHOW REPLICAS Statement") (or before MySQL 8.0.22,
[`SHOW SLAVE HOSTS`](show-slave-hosts.md "15.7.7.34 SHOW SLAVE HOSTS | SHOW REPLICAS Statement")) statement on
the source shows basic information about the replicas. The
output includes the ID of the replica server, the value of the
[`--report-host`](replication-options-replica.md#sysvar_report_host) option, the
connecting port, and source ID:

```sql
mysql> SHOW REPLICAS;
+-----------+----------+------+-------------------+-----------+
| Server_id | Host     | Port | Rpl_recovery_rank | Source_id |
+-----------+----------+------+-------------------+-----------+
|        10 | replica1 | 3306 |                 0 |         1 |
+-----------+----------+------+-------------------+-----------+
1 row in set (0.00 sec)
```
