### 28.3.19 The INFORMATION\_SCHEMA OPTIMIZER\_TRACE Table

The [`OPTIMIZER_TRACE`](information-schema-optimizer-trace-table.md "28.3.19 The INFORMATION_SCHEMA OPTIMIZER_TRACE Table") table provides
information produced by the optimizer tracing capability for
traced statements. To enable tracking, use the
[`optimizer_trace`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_optimizer_trace) system variable.
For details, see [Section 10.15, “Tracing the Optimizer”](optimizer-tracing.md "10.15 Tracing the Optimizer").

The [`OPTIMIZER_TRACE`](information-schema-optimizer-trace-table.md "28.3.19 The INFORMATION_SCHEMA OPTIMIZER_TRACE Table") table has these
columns:

- `QUERY`

  The text of the traced statement.
- `TRACE`

  The trace, in `JSON` format.
- `MISSING_BYTES_BEYOND_MAX_MEM_SIZE`

  Each remembered trace is a string that is extended as
  optimization progresses and appends data to it. The
  [`optimizer_trace_max_mem_size`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_optimizer_trace_max_mem_size)
  variable sets a limit on the total amount of memory used by
  all currently remembered traces. If this limit is reached, the
  current trace is not extended (and thus is incomplete), and
  the `MISSING_BYTES_BEYOND_MAX_MEM_SIZE`
  column shows the number of bytes missing from the trace.
- `INSUFFICIENT_PRIVILEGES`

  If a traced query uses views or stored routines that have
  `SQL SECURITY` with a value of
  `DEFINER`, it may be that a user other than
  the definer is denied from seeing the trace of the query. In
  that case, the trace is shown as empty and
  `INSUFFICIENT_PRIVILEGES` has a value of 1.
  Otherwise, the value is 0.
