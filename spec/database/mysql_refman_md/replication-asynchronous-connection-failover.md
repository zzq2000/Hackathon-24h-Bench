### 19.4.9 Switching Sources and Replicas with Asynchronous Connection Failover

[19.4.9.1 Asynchronous Connection Failover for Sources](replication-asynchronous-connection-failover-source.md)

[19.4.9.2 Asynchronous Connection Failover for Replicas](replication-asynchronous-connection-failover-replica.md)

Beginning with MySQL 8.0.22, you can use the asynchronous
connection failover mechanism to automatically establish an
asynchronous (source to replica) replication connection to a new
source after the existing connection from a replica to its source
fails. The asynchronous connection failover mechanism can be used
to keep a replica synchronized with multiple MySQL servers or
groups of servers that share data. The list of potential source
servers is stored on the replica, and in the event of a connection
failure, a new source is selected from the list based on a
weighted priority that you set.

From MySQL 8.0.23, the asynchronous connection failover mechanism
also supports Group Replication topologies, by automatically
monitoring changes to group membership and distinguishing between
primary and secondary servers. When you add a group member to the
source list and define it as part of a managed group, the
asynchronous connection failover mechanism updates the source list
to keep it in line with membership changes, adding and removing
group members automatically as they join or leave. Only online
group members that are in the majority are used for connections
and obtaining status. The last remaining member of a managed group
is not removed automatically even if it leaves the group, so that
the configuration of the managed group is kept. However, you can
delete a managed group manually if it is no longer needed.

From MySQL 8.0.27, the asynchronous connection failover mechanism
also enables a replica that is part of a managed replication group
to automatically reconnect to the sender if the current receiver
(the primary of the group) fails. This feature works with Group
Replication, on a group configured in single-primary mode, where
the group’s primary is a replica that has a replication channel
using the mechanism. The feature is designed for a group of
senders and a group of receivers to keep synchronized with each
other even when some members are temporarily unavailable. It also
synchronizes a group of receivers with one or more senders that
are not part of a managed group. A replica that is not part of a
replication group cannot use this feature.

The requirements for using the asynchronous connection failover
mechanism are as follows:

- GTIDs must be in use on the source and the replica
  ([`gtid_mode=ON`](replication-options-gtids.md#sysvar_gtid_mode)), and the
  `SOURCE_AUTO_POSITION` |
  `MASTER_AUTO_POSITION` option of the
  [`CHANGE REPLICATION SOURCE TO`](change-replication-source-to.md "15.4.2.3 CHANGE REPLICATION SOURCE TO Statement") |
  [`CHANGE MASTER TO`](change-master-to.md "15.4.2.1 CHANGE MASTER TO Statement") statement must
  be enabled on the replica, so that GTID auto-positioning is
  used for the connection to the source.
- The same replication user account and password must exist on
  all the source servers in the source list for the channel.
  This account is used for the connection to each of the
  sources. You can set up different accounts for different
  channels.
- The replication user account must be given
  `SELECT` permissions on the Performance
  Schema tables, for example, by issuing `GRANT SELECT
  ON performance_schema.* TO
  'repl_user';`
- The replication user account and password cannot be specified
  on the statement used to start replication, because they need
  to be available on the automatic restart for the connection to
  the alternative source. They must be set for the channel using
  the [`CHANGE REPLICATION SOURCE
  TO`](change-replication-source-to.md "15.4.2.3 CHANGE REPLICATION SOURCE TO Statement") | [`CHANGE MASTER TO`](change-master-to.md "15.4.2.1 CHANGE MASTER TO Statement")
  statement on the replica, and recorded in the replication
  metadata repositories.
- If the channel where the asynchronous connection failover
  mechanism is in use is on the primary of a Group Replication
  single-primary mode group, from MySQL 8.0.27, asynchronous
  connection failover between replicas is also active by
  default. In this situation, the replication channel and the
  replication user account and password for the channel must be
  set up on all the secondary servers in the replication group,
  and on any new joining members. If the new servers are
  provisioned using MySQL’s clone functionality, this all
  happens automatically.

  Important

  If you do not want asynchronous connection failover to take
  place between replicas in this situation, disable it by
  disabling the member action
  `mysql_start_failover_channels_if_primary`
  for the group, using the
  [`group_replication_disable_member_action`](group-replication-functions-for-member-actions.md#function_group-replication-disable-member-action)
  function. When the feature is disabled, you do not need to
  configure the replication channel on the secondary group
  members, but if the primary goes offline or into an error
  state, replication stops for the channel.

From MySQL Shell 8.0.27 and MySQL 8.0.27, MySQL
InnoDB ClusterSet is available to provide disaster tolerance for
InnoDB Cluster deployments by linking a primary InnoDB Cluster
with one or more replicas of itself in alternate locations, such
as different datacenters. Consider using this solution instead to
simplify the setup of a new multi-group deployment for
replication, failover, and disaster recovery. You can adopt an
existing Group Replication deployment as an InnoDB Cluster.

InnoDB ClusterSet and InnoDB Cluster are designed to abstract
and simplify the procedures for setting up, managing, monitoring,
recovering, and repairing replication groups. InnoDB ClusterSet
automatically manages replication from a primary cluster to
replica clusters using a dedicated ClusterSet replication channel.
You can use administrator commands to trigger a controlled
switchover or emergency failover between groups if the primary
cluster is not functioning normally. Servers and groups can easily
be added to or removed from the InnoDB ClusterSet deployment
after the initial setup when demand changes. For more information,
see [MySQL InnoDB ClusterSet](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/mysql-shell/8.0/en/innodb-clusterset.html).
