#### 29.12.2.4 The setup\_objects Table

The [`setup_objects`](performance-schema-setup-objects-table.md "29.12.2.4 The setup_objects Table") table controls
whether the Performance Schema monitors particular objects.
This table has a maximum size of 100 rows by default. To
change the table size, modify the
[`performance_schema_setup_objects_size`](performance-schema-system-variables.md#sysvar_performance_schema_setup_objects_size)
system variable at server startup.

The initial [`setup_objects`](performance-schema-setup-objects-table.md "29.12.2.4 The setup_objects Table")
contents look like this:

Modifications to the
[`setup_objects`](performance-schema-setup-objects-table.md "29.12.2.4 The setup_objects Table") table affect object
monitoring immediately.

For object types listed in
[`setup_objects`](performance-schema-setup-objects-table.md "29.12.2.4 The setup_objects Table"), the Performance
Schema uses the table to how to monitor them. Object matching
is based on the `OBJECT_SCHEMA` and
`OBJECT_NAME` columns. Objects for which
there is no match are not monitored.

The effect of the default object configuration is to
instrument all tables except those in the
`mysql`,
`INFORMATION_SCHEMA`, and
`performance_schema` databases. (Tables in
the `INFORMATION_SCHEMA` database are not
instrumented regardless of the contents of
[`setup_objects`](performance-schema-setup-objects-table.md "29.12.2.4 The setup_objects Table"); the row for
`information_schema.%` simply makes this
default explicit.)

When the Performance Schema checks for a match in
[`setup_objects`](performance-schema-setup-objects-table.md "29.12.2.4 The setup_objects Table"), it tries to find
more specific matches first. For example, with a table
`db1.t1`, it looks for a match for
`'db1'` and `'t1'`, then for
`'db1'` and `'%'`, then for
`'%'` and `'%'`. The order
in which matching occurs matters because different matching
[`setup_objects`](performance-schema-setup-objects-table.md "29.12.2.4 The setup_objects Table") rows can have
different `ENABLED` and
`TIMED` values.

Rows can be inserted into or deleted from
[`setup_objects`](performance-schema-setup-objects-table.md "29.12.2.4 The setup_objects Table") by users with the
[`INSERT`](privileges-provided.md#priv_insert) or
[`DELETE`](privileges-provided.md#priv_delete) privilege on the table.
For existing rows, only the `ENABLED` and
`TIMED` columns can be modified, by users
with the [`UPDATE`](privileges-provided.md#priv_update) privilege on
the table.

For more information about the role of the
[`setup_objects`](performance-schema-setup-objects-table.md "29.12.2.4 The setup_objects Table") table in event
filtering, see
[Section 29.4.3, “Event Pre-Filtering”](performance-schema-pre-filtering.md "29.4.3 Event Pre-Filtering").

The [`setup_objects`](performance-schema-setup-objects-table.md "29.12.2.4 The setup_objects Table") table has these
columns:

- `OBJECT_TYPE`

  The type of object to instrument. The value is one of
  `'EVENT'` (Event Scheduler event),
  `'FUNCTION'` (stored function),
  `'PROCEDURE'` (stored procedure),
  `'TABLE'` (base table), or
  `'TRIGGER'` (trigger).

  `TABLE` filtering affects table I/O
  events (`wait/io/table/sql/handler`
  instrument) and table lock events
  (`wait/lock/table/sql/handler`
  instrument).
- `OBJECT_SCHEMA`

  The schema that contains the object. This should be a
  literal name, or `'%'` to mean “any
  schema.”
- `OBJECT_NAME`

  The name of the instrumented object. This should be a
  literal name, or `'%'` to mean “any
  object.”
- `ENABLED`

  Whether events for the object are instrumented. The value
  is `YES` or `NO`. This
  column can be modified.
- `TIMED`

  Whether events for the object are timed. This column can
  be modified.

The [`setup_objects`](performance-schema-setup-objects-table.md "29.12.2.4 The setup_objects Table") table has these
indexes:

- Index on (`OBJECT_TYPE`,
  `OBJECT_SCHEMA`,
  `OBJECT_NAME`)

[`TRUNCATE TABLE`](truncate-table.md "15.1.37 TRUNCATE TABLE Statement") is permitted for
the [`setup_objects`](performance-schema-setup-objects-table.md "29.12.2.4 The setup_objects Table") table. It
removes the rows.
