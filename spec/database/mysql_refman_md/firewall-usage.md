#### 8.4.7.3 Using MySQL Enterprise Firewall

Before using MySQL Enterprise Firewall, install it according to the instructions
provided in [Section 8.4.7.2, “Installing or Uninstalling MySQL Enterprise Firewall”](firewall-installation.md "8.4.7.2 Installing or Uninstalling MySQL Enterprise Firewall").

This section describes how to configure MySQL Enterprise Firewall using SQL
statements. Alternatively, MySQL Workbench 6.3.4 or higher provides
a graphical interface for firewall control. See
[MySQL Enterprise Firewall Interface](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/workbench/en/wb-mysql-firewall.html).

##### Enabling or Disabling the Firewall

To enable or disable the firewall, set the
[`mysql_firewall_mode`](firewall-reference.md#sysvar_mysql_firewall_mode) system
variable. By default, this variable is enabled when the
firewall is installed. To control the initial firewall state
explicitly, you can set the variable at server startup. For
example, to enable the firewall in an option file, use these
lines:

```ini
[mysqld]
mysql_firewall_mode=ON
```

After modifying `my.cnf`, restart the
server to cause the new setting to take effect.

Alternatively, to set and persist the firewall setting at
runtime:

```sql
SET PERSIST mysql_firewall_mode = OFF;
SET PERSIST mysql_firewall_mode = ON;
```

[`SET
PERSIST`](set-variable.md "15.7.6.1 SET Syntax for Variable Assignment") sets a value for the running MySQL instance.
It also saves the value, causing it to carry over to
subsequent server restarts. To change a value for the running
MySQL instance without having it carry over to subsequent
restarts, use the `GLOBAL` keyword rather
than `PERSIST`. See
[Section 15.7.6.1, “SET Syntax for Variable Assignment”](set-variable.md "15.7.6.1 SET Syntax for Variable Assignment").

##### Assigning Firewall Privileges

With the firewall installed, grant the appropriate privileges
to the MySQL account or accounts to be used for administering
it. The privileges depend on which firewall operations an
account should be permitted to perform:

- Grant the [`FIREWALL_EXEMPT`](privileges-provided.md#priv_firewall-exempt)
  privilege (available as of MySQL 8.0.27) to any account
  that should be exempt from firewall restrictions. This is
  useful, for example, for a database administrator who
  configures the firewall, to avoid the possibility of a
  misconfiguration causing even the administrator to be
  locked out and unable to execute statements.
- Grant the [`FIREWALL_ADMIN`](privileges-provided.md#priv_firewall-admin)
  privilege to any account that should have full
  administrative firewall access. (Some administrative
  firewall functions can be invoked by accounts that have
  [`FIREWALL_ADMIN`](privileges-provided.md#priv_firewall-admin)
  *or* the deprecated
  [`SUPER`](privileges-provided.md#priv_super) privilege, as
  indicated in the individual function descriptions.)
- Grant the [`FIREWALL_USER`](privileges-provided.md#priv_firewall-user)
  privilege to any account that should have administrative
  access only for its own firewall rules.
- Grant the [`EXECUTE`](privileges-provided.md#priv_execute) privilege
  for the firewall stored procedures in the
  `mysql` system database. These may invoke
  administrative functions, so stored procedure access also
  requires the privileges indicated earlier that are needed
  for those functions.

Note

The [`FIREWALL_EXEMPT`](privileges-provided.md#priv_firewall-exempt),
[`FIREWALL_ADMIN`](privileges-provided.md#priv_firewall-admin), and
[`FIREWALL_USER`](privileges-provided.md#priv_firewall-user) privileges can
be granted only while the firewall is installed because the
`MYSQL_FIREWALL` plugin defines those
privileges.

##### Firewall Concepts

The MySQL server permits clients to connect and receives from
them SQL statements to be executed. If the firewall is
enabled, the server passes to it each incoming statement that
does not immediately fail with a syntax error. Based on
whether the firewall accepts the statement, the server
executes it or returns an error to the client. This section
describes how the firewall accomplishes the task of accepting
or rejecting statements.

- [Firewall Profiles](firewall-usage.md#firewall-profiles "Firewall Profiles")
- [Firewall Statement Matching](firewall-usage.md#firewall-statement-matching "Firewall Statement Matching")
- [Profile Operational Modes](firewall-usage.md#firewall-profile-modes "Profile Operational Modes")
- [Firewall Statement Handling When Multiple Profiles Apply](firewall-usage.md#firewall-multiple-profiles "Firewall Statement Handling When Multiple Profiles Apply")

###### Firewall Profiles

The firewall uses a registry of profiles that determine
whether to permit statement execution. Profiles have these
attributes:

- An allowlist. The allowlist is the set of rules that
  defines which statements are acceptable to the profile.
- A current operational mode. The mode enables the profile
  to be used in different ways. For example: the profile can
  be placed in training mode to establish the allowlist; the
  allowlist can be used for restricting statement execution
  or intrusion detection; the profile can be disabled
  entirely.
- A scope of applicability. The scope indicates which client
  connections the profile applies to:

  - The firewall supports account-based profiles such that
    each profile matches a particular client account
    (client user name and host name combination). For
    example, you can register one account profile for
    which the allowlist applies to connections originating
    from `admin@localhost` and another
    account profile for which the allowlist applies to
    connections originating from
    `myapp@apphost.example.com`.
  - As of MySQL 8.0.23, the firewall supports group
    profiles that can have multiple accounts as members,
    with the profile allowlist applying equally to all
    members. Group profiles enable easier administration
    and greater flexibility for deployments that require
    applying a given set of allowlist rules to multiple
    accounts.

Initially, no profiles exist, so by default, the firewall
accepts all statements and has no effect on which statements
MySQL accounts can execute. To apply firewall protective
capabilities, explicit action is required:

- Register one or more profiles with the firewall.
- Train the firewall by establishing the allowlist for each
  profile; that is, the types of statements the profile
  permits clients to execute.
- Place the trained profiles in protecting mode to harden
  MySQL against unauthorized statement execution:

  - MySQL associates each client session with a specific
    user name and host name combination. This combination
    is the *session account*.
  - For each client connection, the firewall uses the
    session account to determine which profiles apply to
    handling incoming statements from the client.

    The firewall accepts only statements permitted by the
    applicable profile allowlists.

Most firewall principles apply identically to group profiles
and account profiles. The two types of profiles differ in
these respects:

- An account profile allowlist applies only to a single
  account. A group profile allowlist applies when the
  session account matches any account that is a member of
  the group.
- To apply an allowlist to multiple accounts using account
  profiles, it is necessary to register one profile per
  account and duplicate the allowlist across each profile.
  This entails training each account profile individually
  because each one must be trained using the single account
  to which it applies.

  A group profile allowlist applies to multiple accounts,
  with no need to duplicate it for each account. A group
  profile can be trained using any or all of the group
  member accounts, or training can be limited to any single
  member. Either way, the allowlist applies to all members.
- Account profile names are based on specific user name and
  host name combinations that depend on which clients
  connect to the MySQL server. Group profile names are
  chosen by the firewall administrator with no constraints
  other than that their length must be from 1 to 288
  characters.

Note

Due to the advantages of group profiles over account
profiles, and because a group profile with a single member
account is logically equivalent to an account profile for
that account, it is recommended that all new firewall
profiles be created as group profiles. Account profiles are
deprecated as of MySQL 8.0.26 and subject to removal in a
future MySQL version. For assistance converting existing
account profiles, see
[Migrating Account Profiles to Group Profiles](firewall-usage.md#firewall-account-profile-migration "Migrating Account Profiles to Group Profiles").

The profile-based protection afforded by the firewall enables
implementation of strategies such as these:

- If an application has unique protection requirements,
  configure it to use an account not used for any other
  purpose and set up a group profile or account profile for
  that account.
- If related applications share protection requirements,
  associate each application with its own account, then add
  these application accounts as members of the same group
  profile. Alternatively, configure all the applications to
  use the same account and associate them with an account
  profile for that account.

###### Firewall Statement Matching

Statement matching performed by the firewall does not use SQL
statements as received from clients. Instead, the server
converts incoming statements to normalized digest form and
firewall operation uses these digests. The benefit of
statement normalization is that it enables similar statements
to be grouped and recognized using a single pattern. For
example, these statements are distinct from each other:

```sql
SELECT first_name, last_name FROM customer WHERE customer_id = 1;
select first_name, last_name from customer where customer_id = 99;
SELECT first_name, last_name FROM customer WHERE customer_id = 143;
```

But all of them have the same normalized digest form:

```sql
SELECT `first_name` , `last_name` FROM `customer` WHERE `customer_id` = ?
```

By using normalization, firewall allowlists can store digests
that each match many different statements received from
clients. For more information about normalization and digests,
see [Section 29.10, “Performance Schema Statement Digests and Sampling”](performance-schema-statement-digests.md "29.10 Performance Schema Statement Digests and Sampling").

Warning

Setting the
[`max_digest_length`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_max_digest_length) system
variable to zero disables digest production, which also
disables server functionality that requires digests, such as
MySQL Enterprise Firewall.

###### Profile Operational Modes

Each profile registered with the firewall has its own
operational mode, chosen from these values:

- `OFF`: This mode disables the profile.
  The firewall considers it inactive and ignores it.
- `RECORDING`: This is the firewall
  training mode. Incoming statements received from a client
  that matches the profile are considered acceptable for the
  profile and become part of its “fingerprint.”
  The firewall records the normalized digest form of each
  statement to learn the acceptable statement patterns for
  the profile. Each pattern is a rule, and the union of the
  rules is the profile allowlist.

  A difference between group and account profiles is that
  statement recording for a group profile can be limited to
  statements received from a single group member (the
  training member).
- `PROTECTING`: In this mode, the profile
  allows or prevents statement execution. The firewall
  matches incoming statements against the profile allowlist,
  accepting only statements that match and rejecting those
  that do not. After training a profile in
  `RECORDING` mode, switch it to
  `PROTECTING` mode to harden MySQL against
  access by statements that deviate from the allowlist. If
  the [`mysql_firewall_trace`](firewall-reference.md#sysvar_mysql_firewall_trace)
  system variable is enabled, the firewall also writes
  rejected statements to the error log.
- `DETECTING`: This mode detects but not
  does not block intrusions (statements that are suspicious
  because they match nothing in the profile allowlist). In
  `DETECTING` mode, the firewall writes
  suspicious statements to the error log but accepts them
  without denying access.

When a profile is assigned any of the preceding mode values,
the firewall stores the mode in the profile. Firewall
mode-setting operations also permit a mode value of
`RESET`, but this value is not stored:
setting a profile to `RESET` mode causes the
firewall to delete all rules for the profile and set its mode
to `OFF`.

Note

Messages written to the error log in
`DETECTING` mode or because
[`mysql_firewall_trace`](firewall-reference.md#sysvar_mysql_firewall_trace) is
enabled are written as Notes, which are information
messages. To ensure that such messages appear in the error
log and are not discarded, make sure that error-logging
verbosity is sufficient to include information messages. For
example, if you are using priority-based log filtering, as
described in
[Section 7.4.2.5, “Priority-Based Error Log Filtering (log\_filter\_internal)”](error-log-priority-based-filtering.md "7.4.2.5 Priority-Based Error Log Filtering (log_filter_internal)"), set
the [`log_error_verbosity`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_log_error_verbosity)
system variable to a value of 3.

###### Firewall Statement Handling When Multiple Profiles Apply

For simplicity, later sections that describe how to set up
profiles take the perspective that the firewall matches
incoming statements from a client against only a single
profile, either a group profile or account profile. But
firewall operation can be more complex:

- A group profile can include multiple accounts as members.
- An account can be a member of multiple group profiles.
- Multiple profiles can match a given client.

The following description covers the general case of how the
firewall operates, when potentially multiple profiles apply to
incoming statements.

As previously mentioned, MySQL associates each client session
with a specific user name and host name combination known as
the *session account*. The firewall matches
the session account against registered profiles to determine
which profiles apply to handling incoming statements from the
session:

- The firewall ignores inactive profiles (profiles with a
  mode of `OFF`).
- The session account matches every active group profile
  that includes a member having the same user and host.
  There can be more than one such group profile.
- The session account matches an active account profile
  having the same user and host, if there is one. There is
  at most one such account profile.

In other words, the session account can match 0 or more active
group profiles, and 0 or 1 active account profiles. This means
that 0, 1, or multiple firewall profiles are applicable to a
given session, for which the firewall handles each incoming
statement as follows:

- If there is no applicable profile, the firewall imposes no
  restrictions and accepts the statement.
- If there are applicable profiles, their modes determine
  statement handling:

  - The firewall records the statement in the allowlist of
    each applicable profile that is in
    `RECORDING` mode.
  - The firewall writes the statement to the error log for
    each applicable profile in
    `DETECTING` mode for which the
    statement is suspicious (does not match the profile
    allowlist).
  - The firewall accepts the statement if at least one
    applicable profile is in `RECORDING`
    or `DETECTING` mode (those modes
    accept all statements), or if the statement matches
    the allowlist of at least one applicable profile in
    `PROTECTING` mode. Otherwise, the
    firewall rejects the statement (and writes it to the
    error log if the
    [`mysql_firewall_trace`](firewall-reference.md#sysvar_mysql_firewall_trace)
    system variable is enabled).

With that description in mind, the next sections revert to the
simplicity of the situations when a single group profile or a
single account profile apply, and cover how to set up each
type of profile.

##### Registering Firewall Group Profiles

MySQL Enterprise Firewall supports registration of group profiles as of MySQL
8.0.23. A group profile can have multiple accounts as its
members. To use a firewall group profile to protect MySQL
against incoming statements from a given account, follow these
steps:

1. Register the group profile and put it in
   `RECORDING` mode.
2. Add a member account to the group profile.
3. Connect to the MySQL server using the member account and
   execute statements to be learned. This trains the group
   profile and establishes the rules that form the profile
   allowlist.
4. Add to the group profile any other accounts that are to be
   group members.
5. Switch the group profile to `PROTECTING`
   mode. When a client connects to the server using any
   account that is a member of the group profile, the profile
   allowlist restricts statement execution.
6. Should additional training be necessary, switch the group
   profile to `RECORDING` mode again, update
   its allowlist with new statement patterns, then switch it
   back to `PROTECTING` mode.

Observe these guidelines for firewall-related account
references:

- Take note of the context in which account references
  occur. To name an account for firewall operations, specify
  it as a single quoted string
  (`'user_name@host_name'`).
  This differs from the usual MySQL convention for
  statements such as [`CREATE
  USER`](create-user.md "15.7.1.3 CREATE USER Statement") and [`GRANT`](grant.md "15.7.1.6 GRANT Statement"),
  for which you quote the user and host parts of an account
  name separately
  (`'user_name'@'host_name'`).

  The requirement for naming accounts as a single quoted
  string for firewall operations means that you cannot use
  accounts that have embedded `@`
  characters in the user name.
- The firewall assesses statements against accounts
  represented by actual user and host names as authenticated
  by the server. When registering accounts in profiles, do
  not use wildcard characters or netmasks:

  - Suppose that an account named
    `me@%.example.org` exists and a
    client uses it to connect to the server from the host
    `abc.example.org`.
  - The account name contains a `%`
    wildcard character, but the server authenticates the
    client as having a user name of `me`
    and host name of `abc.example.com`,
    and that is what the firewall sees.
  - Consequently, the account name to use for firewall
    operations is `me@abc.example.org`
    rather than `me@%.example.org`.

The following procedure shows how to register a group profile
with the firewall, train the firewall to know the acceptable
statements for that profile (its allowlist), use the profile
to protect MySQL against execution of unacceptable statements,
and add and remove group members. The example uses a group
profile name of `fwgrp`. The example profile
is presumed for use by clients of an application that accesses
tables in the `sakila` database (available at
<https://dev.mysql.com/doc/index-other.html>).

Use an administrative MySQL account to perform the steps in
this procedure, except those steps designated for execution by
member accounts of the firewall group profile. For statements
executed by member accounts, the default database should be
`sakila`. (You can use a different database
by adjusting the instructions accordingly.)

1. If necessary, create the accounts that are to be members
   of the `fwgrp` group profile and grant
   them appropriate access privileges. Statements for one
   member are shown here (choose an appropriate password):

   ```sql
   CREATE USER 'member1'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'password';
   GRANT ALL ON sakila.* TO 'member1'@'localhost';
   ```
2. Use the `sp_set_firewall_group_mode()`
   stored procedure to register the group profile with the
   firewall and place the profile in
   `RECORDING` (training) mode:

   ```sql
   CALL mysql.sp_set_firewall_group_mode('fwgrp', 'RECORDING');
   ```
3. Use the `sp_firewall_group_enlist()`
   stored procedure to add an initial member account for use
   in training the group profile allowlist:

   ```sql
   CALL mysql.sp_firewall_group_enlist('fwgrp', 'member1@localhost');
   ```
4. To train the group profile using the initial member
   account, connect to the server as
   `member1` from the server host so that
   the firewall sees a session account of
   `member1@localhost`. Then execute some
   statements to be considered legitimate for the profile.
   For example:

   ```sql
   SELECT title, release_year FROM film WHERE film_id = 1;
   UPDATE actor SET last_update = NOW() WHERE actor_id = 1;
   SELECT store_id, COUNT(*) FROM inventory GROUP BY store_id;
   ```

   The firewall receives the statements from the
   `member1@localhost` account. Because that
   account is a member of the `fwgrp`
   profile, which is in `RECORDING` mode,
   the firewall interprets the statements as applicable to
   `fwgrp` and records the normalized digest
   form of the statements as rules in the
   `fwgrp` allowlist. Those rules then apply
   to all accounts that are members of
   `fwgrp`.

   Note

   Until the `fwgrp` group profile
   receives statements in `RECORDING`
   mode, its allowlist is empty, which is equivalent to
   “deny all.” No statement can match an empty
   allowlist, which has these implications:

   - The group profile cannot be switched to
     `PROTECTING` mode. It would reject
     every statement, effectively prohibiting the
     accounts that are group members from executing any
     statement.
   - The group profile can be switched to
     `DETECTING` mode. In this case, the
     profile accepts every statement but logs it as
     suspicious.
5. At this point, the group profile information is cached,
   including its name, membership, and allowlist. To see this
   information, query the Performance Schema firewall tables:

   ```sql
   mysql> SELECT MODE FROM performance_schema.firewall_groups
          WHERE NAME = 'fwgrp';
   +-----------+
   | MODE      |
   +-----------+
   | RECORDING |
   +-----------+
   mysql> SELECT * FROM performance_schema.firewall_membership
          WHERE GROUP_ID = 'fwgrp' ORDER BY MEMBER_ID;
   +----------+-------------------+
   | GROUP_ID | MEMBER_ID         |
   +----------+-------------------+
   | fwgrp    | member1@localhost |
   +----------+-------------------+
   mysql> SELECT RULE FROM performance_schema.firewall_group_allowlist
          WHERE NAME = 'fwgrp';
   +----------------------------------------------------------------------+
   | RULE                                                                 |
   +----------------------------------------------------------------------+
   | SELECT @@`version_comment` LIMIT ?                                   |
   | UPDATE `actor` SET `last_update` = NOW ( ) WHERE `actor_id` = ?      |
   | SELECT `title` , `release_year` FROM `film` WHERE `film_id` = ?      |
   | SELECT `store_id` , COUNT ( * ) FROM `inventory` GROUP BY `store_id` |
   +----------------------------------------------------------------------+
   ```

   Note

   The `@@version_comment` rule comes from
   a statement sent automatically by the
   [**mysql**](mysql.md "6.5.1 mysql — The MySQL Command-Line Client") client when you connect to the
   server.

   Important

   Train the firewall under conditions matching application
   use. For example, to determine server characteristics
   and capabilities, a given MySQL connector might send
   statements to the server at the beginning of each
   session. If an application normally is used through that
   connector, train the firewall using the connector, too.
   That enables those initial statements to become part of
   the allowlist for the group profile associated with the
   application.
6. Invoke `sp_set_firewall_group_mode()`
   again to switch the group profile to
   `PROTECTING` mode:

   ```sql
   CALL mysql.sp_set_firewall_group_mode('fwgrp', 'PROTECTING');
   ```

   Important

   Switching the group profile out of
   `RECORDING` mode synchronizes its
   cached data to the `mysql` system
   database tables that provide persistent underlying
   storage. If you do not switch the mode for a profile
   that is being recorded, the cached data is not written
   to persistent storage and is lost when the server is
   restarted.
7. Add to the group profile any other accounts that should be
   members:

   ```sql
   CALL mysql.sp_firewall_group_enlist('fwgrp', 'member2@localhost');
   CALL mysql.sp_firewall_group_enlist('fwgrp', 'member3@localhost');
   CALL mysql.sp_firewall_group_enlist('fwgrp', 'member4@localhost');
   ```

   The profile allowlist trained using the
   `member1@localhost` account now also
   applies to the additional accounts.
8. To verify the updated group membership, query the
   `firewall_membership` table again:

   ```sql
   mysql> SELECT * FROM performance_schema.firewall_membership
          WHERE GROUP_ID = 'fwgrp' ORDER BY MEMBER_ID;
   +----------+-------------------+
   | GROUP_ID | MEMBER_ID         |
   +----------+-------------------+
   | fwgrp    | member1@localhost |
   | fwgrp    | member2@localhost |
   | fwgrp    | member3@localhost |
   | fwgrp    | member4@localhost |
   +----------+-------------------+
   ```
9. Test the group profile against the firewall by using any
   account in the group to execute some acceptable and
   unacceptable statements. The firewall matches each
   statement from the account against the profile allowlist
   and accepts or rejects it:

   - This statement is not identical to a training
     statement but produces the same normalized statement
     as one of them, so the firewall accepts it:

     ```sql
     mysql> SELECT title, release_year FROM film WHERE film_id = 98;
     +-------------------+--------------+
     | title             | release_year |
     +-------------------+--------------+
     | BRIGHT ENCOUNTERS |         2006 |
     +-------------------+--------------+
     ```
   - These statements match nothing in the allowlist, so
     the firewall rejects each with an error:

     ```sql
     mysql> SELECT title, release_year FROM film WHERE film_id = 98 OR TRUE;
     ERROR 1045 (28000): Statement was blocked by Firewall
     mysql> SHOW TABLES LIKE 'customer%';
     ERROR 1045 (28000): Statement was blocked by Firewall
     mysql> TRUNCATE TABLE mysql.slow_log;
     ERROR 1045 (28000): Statement was blocked by Firewall
     ```
   - If the
     [`mysql_firewall_trace`](firewall-reference.md#sysvar_mysql_firewall_trace)
     system variable is enabled, the firewall also writes
     rejected statements to the error log. For example:

     ```none
     [Note] Plugin MYSQL_FIREWALL reported:
     'ACCESS DENIED for 'member1@localhost'. Reason: No match in allowlist.
     Statement: TRUNCATE TABLE `mysql` . `slow_log`'
     ```

     These log messages may be helpful in identifying the
     source of attacks, should that be necessary.
10. Should members need to be removed from the group profile,
    use the `sp_firewall_group_delist()`
    stored procedure rather than
    `sp_firewall_group_enlist()`:

    ```sql
    CALL mysql.sp_firewall_group_delist('fwgrp', 'member3@localhost');
    ```

The firewall group profile now is trained for member accounts.
When clients connect using any account in the group and
attempt to execute statements, the profile protects MySQL
against statements not matched by the profile allowlist.

The procedure just shown added only one member to the group
profile before training its allowlist. Doing so provides
better control over the training period by limiting which
accounts can add new acceptable statements to the allowlist.
Should additional training be necessary, you can switch the
profile back to `RECORDING` mode:

```sql
CALL mysql.sp_set_firewall_group_mode('fwgrp', 'RECORDING');
```

However, that enables any member of the group to execute
statements and add them to the allowlist. To limit the
additional training to a single group member, call
`sp_set_firewall_group_mode_and_user()`,
which is like `sp_set_firewall_group_mode()`
but takes one more argument specifying which account is
permitted to train the profile in `RECORDING`
mode. For example, to enable training only by
`member4@localhost`, do this:

```sql
CALL mysql.sp_set_firewall_group_mode_and_user('fwgrp', 'RECORDING', 'member4@localhost');
```

That enables additional training by the specified account
without having to remove the other group members. They can
execute statements, but the statements are not added to the
allowlist. (Remember, however, that in
`RECORDING` mode the other members can
execute *any* statement.)

Note

To avoid unexpected behavior when a particular account is
specified as the training account for a group profile,
always ensure that account is a member of the group.

After the additional training, set the group profile back to
`PROTECTING` mode:

```sql
CALL mysql.sp_set_firewall_group_mode('fwgrp', 'PROTECTING');
```

The training account established by
`sp_set_firewall_group_mode_and_user()` is
saved in the group profile, so the firewall remembers it in
case more training is needed later. Thus, if you call
`sp_set_firewall_group_mode()` (which takes
no training account argument), the current profile training
account, `member4@localhost`, remains
unchanged.

To clear the training account if it actually is desired to
enable all group members to perform training in
`RECORDING` mode, call
`sp_set_firewall_group_mode_and_user()` and
pass a `NULL` value for the account argument:

```sql
CALL mysql.sp_set_firewall_group_mode_and_user('fwgrp', 'RECORDING', NULL);
```

It is possible to detect intrusions by logging nonmatching
statements as suspicious without denying access. First, put
the group profile in `DETECTING` mode:

```sql
CALL mysql.sp_set_firewall_group_mode('fwgrp', 'DETECTING');
```

Then, using a member account, execute a statement that does
not match the group profile allowlist. In
`DETECTING` mode, the firewall permits the
nonmatching statement to execute:

```sql
mysql> SHOW TABLES LIKE 'customer%';
+------------------------------+
| Tables_in_sakila (customer%) |
+------------------------------+
| customer                     |
| customer_list                |
+------------------------------+
```

In addition, the firewall writes a message to the error log:

```none
[Note] Plugin MYSQL_FIREWALL reported:
'SUSPICIOUS STATEMENT from 'member1@localhost'. Reason: No match in allowlist.
Statement: SHOW TABLES LIKE ?'
```

To disable a group profile, change its mode to
`OFF`:

```sql
CALL mysql.sp_set_firewall_group_mode(group, 'OFF');
```

To forget all training for a profile and disable it, reset it:

```sql
CALL mysql.sp_set_firewall_group_mode(group, 'RESET');
```

The reset operation causes the firewall to delete all rules
for the profile and set its mode to `OFF`.

##### Registering Firewall Account Profiles

MySQL Enterprise Firewall enables profiles to be registered that correspond to
individual accounts. To use a firewall account profile to
protect MySQL against incoming statements from a given
account, follow these steps:

1. Register the account profile and put it in
   `RECORDING` mode.
2. Connect to the MySQL server using the account and execute
   statements to be learned. This trains the account profile
   and establishes the rules that form the profile allowlist.
3. Switch the account profile to
   `PROTECTING` mode. When a client connects
   to the server using the account, the account profile
   allowlist restricts statement execution.
4. Should additional training be necessary, switch the
   account profile to `RECORDING` mode
   again, update its allowlist with new statement patterns,
   then switch it back to `PROTECTING` mode.

Observe these guidelines for firewall-related account
references:

- Take note of the context in which account references
  occur. To name an account for firewall operations, specify
  it as a single quoted string
  (`'user_name@host_name'`).
  This differs from the usual MySQL convention for
  statements such as [`CREATE
  USER`](create-user.md "15.7.1.3 CREATE USER Statement") and [`GRANT`](grant.md "15.7.1.6 GRANT Statement"),
  for which you quote the user and host parts of an account
  name separately
  (`'user_name'@'host_name'`).

  The requirement for naming accounts as a single quoted
  string for firewall operations means that you cannot use
  accounts that have embedded `@`
  characters in the user name.
- The firewall assesses statements against accounts
  represented by actual user and host names as authenticated
  by the server. When registering accounts in profiles, do
  not use wildcard characters or netmasks:

  - Suppose that an account named
    `me@%.example.org` exists and a
    client uses it to connect to the server from the host
    `abc.example.org`.
  - The account name contains a `%`
    wildcard character, but the server authenticates the
    client as having a user name of `me`
    and host name of `abc.example.com`,
    and that is what the firewall sees.
  - Consequently, the account name to use for firewall
    operations is `me@abc.example.org`
    rather than `me@%.example.org`.

The following procedure shows how to register an account
profile with the firewall, train the firewall to know the
acceptable statements for that profile (its allowlist), and
use the profile to protect MySQL against execution of
unacceptable statements by the account. The example account,
`fwuser@localhost`, is presumed for use by an
application that accesses tables in the
`sakila` database (available at
<https://dev.mysql.com/doc/index-other.html>).

Use an administrative MySQL account to perform the steps in
this procedure, except those steps designated for execution by
the `fwuser@localhost` account that
corresponds to the account profile registered with the
firewall. For statements executed using this account, the
default database should be `sakila`. (You can
use a different database by adjusting the instructions
accordingly.)

1. If necessary, create the account to use for executing
   statements (choose an appropriate password) and grant it
   privileges for the `sakila` database:

   ```sql
   CREATE USER 'fwuser'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'password';
   GRANT ALL ON sakila.* TO 'fwuser'@'localhost';
   ```
2. Use the `sp_set_firewall_mode()` stored
   procedure to register the account profile with the
   firewall and place the profile in
   `RECORDING` (training) mode:

   ```sql
   CALL mysql.sp_set_firewall_mode('fwuser@localhost', 'RECORDING');
   ```
3. To train the registered account profile, connect to the
   server as `fwuser` from the server host
   so that the firewall sees a session account of
   `fwuser@localhost`. Then use the account
   to execute some statements to be considered legitimate for
   the profile. For example:

   ```sql
   SELECT first_name, last_name FROM customer WHERE customer_id = 1;
   UPDATE rental SET return_date = NOW() WHERE rental_id = 1;
   SELECT get_customer_balance(1, NOW());
   ```

   Because the profile is in `RECORDING`
   mode, the firewall records the normalized digest form of
   the statements as rules in the profile allowlist.

   Note

   Until the `fwuser@localhost` account
   profile receives statements in
   `RECORDING` mode, its allowlist is
   empty, which is equivalent to “deny all.”
   No statement can match an empty allowlist, which has
   these implications:

   - The account profile cannot be switched to
     `PROTECTING` mode. It would reject
     every statement, effectively prohibiting the account
     from executing any statement.
   - The account profile can be switched to
     `DETECTING` mode. In this case, the
     profile accepts every statement but logs it as
     suspicious.
4. At this point, the account profile information is cached.
   To see this information, query the
   `INFORMATION_SCHEMA` firewall tables:

   ```sql
   mysql> SELECT MODE FROM INFORMATION_SCHEMA.MYSQL_FIREWALL_USERS
          WHERE USERHOST = 'fwuser@localhost';
   +-----------+
   | MODE      |
   +-----------+
   | RECORDING |
   +-----------+
   mysql> SELECT RULE FROM INFORMATION_SCHEMA.MYSQL_FIREWALL_WHITELIST
          WHERE USERHOST = 'fwuser@localhost';
   +----------------------------------------------------------------------------+
   | RULE                                                                       |
   +----------------------------------------------------------------------------+
   | SELECT `first_name` , `last_name` FROM `customer` WHERE `customer_id` = ?  |
   | SELECT `get_customer_balance` ( ? , NOW ( ) )                              |
   | UPDATE `rental` SET `return_date` = NOW ( ) WHERE `rental_id` = ?          |
   | SELECT @@`version_comment` LIMIT ?                                         |
   +----------------------------------------------------------------------------+
   ```

   Note

   The `@@version_comment` rule comes from
   a statement sent automatically by the
   [**mysql**](mysql.md "6.5.1 mysql — The MySQL Command-Line Client") client when you connect to the
   server.

   Important

   Train the firewall under conditions matching application
   use. For example, to determine server characteristics
   and capabilities, a given MySQL connector might send
   statements to the server at the beginning of each
   session. If an application normally is used through that
   connector, train the firewall using the connector, too.
   That enables those initial statements to become part of
   the allowlist for the account profile associated with
   the application.
5. Invoke `sp_set_firewall_mode()` again,
   this time switching the account profile to
   `PROTECTING` mode:

   ```sql
   CALL mysql.sp_set_firewall_mode('fwuser@localhost', 'PROTECTING');
   ```

   Important

   Switching the account profile out of
   `RECORDING` mode synchronizes its
   cached data to the `mysql` system
   database tables that provide persistent underlying
   storage. If you do not switch the mode for a profile
   that is being recorded, the cached data is not written
   to persistent storage and is lost when the server is
   restarted.
6. Test the account profile by using the account to execute
   some acceptable and unacceptable statements. The firewall
   matches each statement from the account against the
   profile allowlist and accepts or rejects it:

   - This statement is not identical to a training
     statement but produces the same normalized statement
     as one of them, so the firewall accepts it:

     ```sql
     mysql> SELECT first_name, last_name FROM customer WHERE customer_id = '48';
     +------------+-----------+
     | first_name | last_name |
     +------------+-----------+
     | ANN        | EVANS     |
     +------------+-----------+
     ```
   - These statements match nothing in the allowlist, so
     the firewall rejects each with an error:

     ```sql
     mysql> SELECT first_name, last_name FROM customer WHERE customer_id = 1 OR TRUE;
     ERROR 1045 (28000): Statement was blocked by Firewall
     mysql> SHOW TABLES LIKE 'customer%';
     ERROR 1045 (28000): Statement was blocked by Firewall
     mysql> TRUNCATE TABLE mysql.slow_log;
     ERROR 1045 (28000): Statement was blocked by Firewall
     ```
   - If the
     [`mysql_firewall_trace`](firewall-reference.md#sysvar_mysql_firewall_trace)
     system variable is enabled, the firewall also writes
     rejected statements to the error log. For example:

     ```none
     [Note] Plugin MYSQL_FIREWALL reported:
     'ACCESS DENIED for fwuser@localhost. Reason: No match in allowlist.
     Statement: TRUNCATE TABLE `mysql` . `slow_log`'
     ```

     These log messages may be helpful in identifying the
     source of attacks, should that be necessary.

The firewall account profile now is trained for the
`fwuser@localhost` account. When clients
connect using that account and attempt to execute statements,
the profile protects MySQL against statements not matched by
the profile allowlist.

It is possible to detect intrusions by logging nonmatching
statements as suspicious without denying access. First, put
the account profile in `DETECTING` mode:

```sql
CALL mysql.sp_set_firewall_mode('fwuser@localhost', 'DETECTING');
```

Then, using the account, execute a statement that does not
match the account profile allowlist. In
`DETECTING` mode, the firewall permits the
nonmatching statement to execute:

```sql
mysql> SHOW TABLES LIKE 'customer%';
+------------------------------+
| Tables_in_sakila (customer%) |
+------------------------------+
| customer                     |
| customer_list                |
+------------------------------+
```

In addition, the firewall writes a message to the error log:

```none
[Note] Plugin MYSQL_FIREWALL reported:
'SUSPICIOUS STATEMENT from 'fwuser@localhost'. Reason: No match in allowlist.
Statement: SHOW TABLES LIKE ?'
```

To disable an account profile, change its mode to
`OFF`:

```sql
CALL mysql.sp_set_firewall_mode(user, 'OFF');
```

To forget all training for a profile and disable it, reset it:

```sql
CALL mysql.sp_set_firewall_mode(user, 'RESET');
```

The reset operation causes the firewall to delete all rules
for the profile and set its mode to `OFF`.

##### Monitoring the Firewall

To assess firewall activity, examine its status variables. For
example, after performing the procedure shown earlier to train
and protect the `fwgrp` group profile, the
variables look like this:

```sql
mysql> SHOW GLOBAL STATUS LIKE 'Firewall%';
+----------------------------+-------+
| Variable_name              | Value |
+----------------------------+-------+
| Firewall_access_denied     | 3     |
| Firewall_access_granted    | 4     |
| Firewall_access_suspicious | 1     |
| Firewall_cached_entries    | 4     |
+----------------------------+-------+
```

The variables indicate the number of statements rejected,
accepted, logged as suspicious, and added to the cache,
respectively. The
[`Firewall_access_granted`](firewall-reference.md#statvar_Firewall_access_granted)
count is 4 because of the `@@version_comment`
statement sent by the [**mysql**](mysql.md "6.5.1 mysql — The MySQL Command-Line Client") client each of
the three times you connected using the registered account,
plus the [`SHOW TABLES`](show-tables.md "15.7.7.39 SHOW TABLES Statement") statement
that was not blocked in `DETECTING` mode.

##### Migrating Account Profiles to Group Profiles

Prior to MySQL 8.0.23, MySQL Enterprise Firewall supports only account profiles
that each apply to a single account. As of MySQL 8.0.23, the
firewall also supports group profiles that each can apply to
multiple accounts. A group profile enables easier
administration when the same allowlist is to be applied to
multiple accounts: instead of creating one account profile per
account and duplicating the allowlist across all those
profiles, create a single group profile and make the accounts
members of it. The group allowlist then applies to all the
accounts.

A group profile with a single member account is logically
equivalent to an account profile for that account, so it is
possible to administer the firewall using group profiles
exclusively, rather than a mix of account and group profiles.
For new firewall installations, that is accomplished by
uniformly creating new profiles as group profiles and avoiding
account profiles.

Due to the greater flexibility offered by group profiles, it
is recommended that all new firewall profiles be created as
group profiles. Account profiles are deprecated as of MySQL
8.0.26 and subject to removal in a future MySQL version. For
upgrades from firewall installations that already contain
account profiles, MySQL Enterprise Firewall in MySQL 8.0.26 and higher includes a
stored procedure named
`sp_migrate_firewall_user_to_group()` to help
you convert account profiles to group profiles. To use it,
perform the following procedure as a user who has the
[`FIREWALL_ADMIN`](privileges-provided.md#priv_firewall-admin) privilege:

1. Run the
   `firewall_profile_migration.sql` script
   to install the
   `sp_migrate_firewall_user_to_group()`
   stored procedure. The script is located in the
   `share` directory of your MySQL
   installation.

   ```terminal
   $> mysql -u root -p < firewall_profile_migration.sql
   Enter password: (enter root password here)
   ```
2. Identify which account profiles exist by querying the
   Information Schema
   [`MYSQL_FIREWALL_USERS`](information-schema-mysql-firewall-users-table.md "28.7.2 The INFORMATION_SCHEMA MYSQL_FIREWALL_USERS Table") table.
   For example:

   ```sql
   mysql> SELECT USERHOST FROM INFORMATION_SCHEMA.MYSQL_FIREWALL_USERS;
   +-------------------------------+
   | USERHOST                      |
   +-------------------------------+
   | admin@localhost               |
   | local_client@localhost        |
   | remote_client@abc.example.com |
   +-------------------------------+
   ```
3. For each account profile identified by the previous step,
   convert it to a group profile:

   ```sql
   CALL mysql.sp_migrate_firewall_user_to_group('admin@localhost', 'admins');
   CALL mysql.sp_migrate_firewall_user_to_group('local_client@localhost', 'local_clients');
   CALL mysql.sp_migrate_firewall_user_to_group('remote_client@localhost', 'remote_clients');
   ```

   In each case, the account profile must exist and must not
   currently be in `RECORDING` mode, and the
   group profile must not already exist. The resulting group
   profile has the named account as its single enlisted
   member, which is also set as the group training account.
   The group profile operational mode is taken from the
   account profile operational mode.
4. (Optional) Remove
   `sp_migrate_firewall_user_to_group()`:

   ```sql
   DROP PROCEDURE IF EXISTS mysql.sp_migrate_firewall_user_to_group;
   ```

For additional details about
`sp_migrate_firewall_user_to_group()`, see
[Firewall Miscellaneous Stored Procedures](firewall-reference.md#firewall-stored-routines-miscellaneous "Firewall Miscellaneous Stored Procedures").
