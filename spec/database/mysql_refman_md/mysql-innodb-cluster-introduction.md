# Chapter 23 InnoDB Cluster

This chapter introduces MySQL InnoDB Cluster, which combines MySQL
technologies to enable you to deploy and administer a complete
integrated high availability solution for MySQL. This content is a
high-level overview of InnoDB Cluster, for full documentation, see
[MySQL InnoDB Cluster](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/mysql-shell/8.0/en/mysql-innodb-cluster.html).

Important

InnoDB Cluster does not provide support for MySQL NDB Cluster. For
more information about MySQL NDB Cluster, see
[Chapter 25, *MySQL NDB Cluster 8.0*](mysql-cluster.md "Chapter 25 MySQL NDB Cluster 8.0") and
[Section 25.2.6, “MySQL Server Using InnoDB Compared with NDB Cluster”](mysql-cluster-compared.md "25.2.6 MySQL Server Using InnoDB Compared with NDB Cluster").

An InnoDB Cluster consists of at least three MySQL Server
instances, and it provides high-availability and scaling features.
InnoDB Cluster uses the following MySQL technologies:

- [MySQL Shell](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/mysql-shell/8.0/en/), which is an
  advanced client and code editor for MySQL.
- MySQL Server, and [Group
  Replication](group-replication.md "Chapter 20 Group Replication"), which enables a set of MySQL instances to
  provide high-availability. InnoDB Cluster provides an
  alternative, easy to use programmatic way to work with Group
  Replication.
- [MySQL Router](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/mysql-router/8.0/en/), a lightweight
  middleware that provides transparent routing between your
  application and InnoDB Cluster.

The following diagram shows an overview of how these technologies
work together:

**Figure 23.1 InnoDB Cluster overview**

![Three MySQL servers are grouped together as a high availability cluster. One of the servers is the read/write primary instance, and the other two are read-only secondary instances. Group Replication is used to replicate data from the primary instance to the secondary instances. MySQL Router connects client applications (in this example, a MySQL Connector) to the primary instance.](images/innodb_cluster_overview.png)

Being built on MySQL [Group
Replication](group-replication.md "Chapter 20 Group Replication"), provides features such as automatic membership
management, fault tolerance, automatic failover, and so on. An
InnoDB Cluster usually runs in a single-primary mode, with one
primary instance (read-write) and multiple secondary instances
(read-only). Advanced users can also take advantage of a
[multi-primary](group-replication-multi-primary-mode.md "20.1.3.2 Multi-Primary Mode")
mode, where all instances are primaries. You can even change the
topology of the cluster while InnoDB Cluster is online, to ensure
the highest possible availability.

You work with InnoDB Cluster using the
[AdminAPI](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/mysql-shell/8.0/en/admin-api-overview.html), provided as
part of MySQL Shell. AdminAPI is available in JavaScript and
Python, and is well suited to scripting and automation of
deployments of MySQL to achieve high-availability and scalability.
By using MySQL Shell's AdminAPI, you can avoid the need to
configure many instances manually. Instead, AdminAPI provides an
effective modern interface to sets of MySQL instances and enables
you to provision, administer, and monitor your deployment from one
central tool.

To get started with InnoDB Cluster you need to
[download](https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/shell/)
and [install](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/mysql-shell/8.0/en/mysql-shell-install.html) MySQL Shell.
You need some hosts with MySQL Server instances
[installed](installing.md "Chapter 2 Installing MySQL"), and you can also
[install](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/mysql-router/8.0/en/mysql-router-installation.html) MySQL Router.

InnoDB Cluster supports [MySQL
Clone](clone-plugin.md "7.6.7 The Clone Plugin"), which enables you to provision instances simply. In
the past, to provision a new instance before it joins a set of MySQL
instances you would need to somehow manually transfer the
transactions to the joining instance. This could involve making file
copies, manually copying them, and so on. Using InnoDB Cluster,
you can simply [add an
instance](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/mysql-shell/8.0/en/add-instances-cluster.html) to the cluster and it is automatically provisioned.

Similarly, InnoDB Cluster is tightly integrated with
[MySQL Router](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/mysql-router/8.0/en/), and you can use
AdminAPI to [work with](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/mysql-shell/8.0/en/registered-routers.html)
them together. MySQL Router can automatically configure itself based on
an InnoDB Cluster, in a process called
[bootstrapping](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/mysql-shell/8.0/en/admin-api-bootstrapping-router.html),
which removes the need for you to configure routing manually.
MySQL Router then transparently connects client applications to the
InnoDB Cluster, providing routing and load-balancing for client
connections. This integration also enables you to administer some
aspects of a MySQL Router bootstrapped against an InnoDB Cluster using
AdminAPI. InnoDB Cluster status information includes details
about MySQL Routers bootstrapped against the cluster. Operations enable
you to [create MySQL Router
users](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/mysql-shell/8.0/en/configuring-router-user.html) at the cluster level, to work with the MySQL Routers
bootstrapped against the cluster, and so on.

For more information on these technologies, see the user
documentation linked in the descriptions. In addition to this user
documentation, there is developer documentation for all AdminAPI
methods in the MySQL Shell JavaScript API Reference or MySQL Shell
Python API Reference, available from
[Connectors and APIs](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/index-connectors.html).
