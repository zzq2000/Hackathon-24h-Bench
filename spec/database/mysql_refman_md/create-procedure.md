### 15.1.17 CREATE PROCEDURE and CREATE FUNCTION Statements

```sql
CREATE
    [DEFINER = user]
    PROCEDURE [IF NOT EXISTS] sp_name ([proc_parameter[,...]])
    [characteristic ...] routine_body

CREATE
    [DEFINER = user]
    FUNCTION [IF NOT EXISTS] sp_name ([func_parameter[,...]])
    RETURNS type
    [characteristic ...] routine_body

proc_parameter:
    [ IN | OUT | INOUT ] param_name type

func_parameter:
    param_name type

type:
    Any valid MySQL data type

characteristic: {
    COMMENT 'string'
  | LANGUAGE SQL
  | [NOT] DETERMINISTIC
  | { CONTAINS SQL | NO SQL | READS SQL DATA | MODIFIES SQL DATA }
  | SQL SECURITY { DEFINER | INVOKER }
}

routine_body:
    Valid SQL routine statement
```

These statements are used to create a stored routine (a stored
procedure or function). That is, the specified routine becomes
known to the server. By default, a stored routine is associated
with the default database. To associate the routine explicitly
with a given database, specify the name as
*`db_name.sp_name`* when you create it.

The `CREATE FUNCTION` statement is also used in
MySQL to support loadable functions. See
[Section 15.7.4.1, “CREATE FUNCTION Statement for Loadable Functions”](create-function-loadable.md "15.7.4.1 CREATE FUNCTION Statement for Loadable Functions"). A loadable function
can be regarded as an external stored function. Stored functions
share their namespace with loadable functions. See
[Section 11.2.5, “Function Name Parsing and Resolution”](function-resolution.md "11.2.5 Function Name Parsing and Resolution"), for the rules describing
how the server interprets references to different kinds of
functions.

To invoke a stored procedure, use the
[`CALL`](call.md "15.2.1 CALL Statement") statement (see
[Section 15.2.1, “CALL Statement”](call.md "15.2.1 CALL Statement")). To invoke a stored function, refer to it
in an expression. The function returns a value during expression
evaluation.

[`CREATE PROCEDURE`](create-procedure.md "15.1.17 CREATE PROCEDURE and CREATE FUNCTION Statements") and
[`CREATE FUNCTION`](create-function.md "15.1.14 CREATE FUNCTION Statement") require the
[`CREATE ROUTINE`](privileges-provided.md#priv_create-routine) privilege. If the
`DEFINER` clause is present, the privileges
required depend on the *`user`* value, as
discussed in [Section 27.6, “Stored Object Access Control”](stored-objects-security.md "27.6 Stored Object Access Control"). If binary
logging is enabled, [`CREATE FUNCTION`](create-function.md "15.1.14 CREATE FUNCTION Statement")
might require the [`SUPER`](privileges-provided.md#priv_super) privilege,
as discussed in [Section 27.7, “Stored Program Binary Logging”](stored-programs-logging.md "27.7 Stored Program Binary Logging").

By default, MySQL automatically grants the
[`ALTER ROUTINE`](privileges-provided.md#priv_alter-routine) and
[`EXECUTE`](privileges-provided.md#priv_execute) privileges to the routine
creator. This behavior can be changed by disabling the
[`automatic_sp_privileges`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_automatic_sp_privileges) system
variable. See [Section 27.2.2, “Stored Routines and MySQL Privileges”](stored-routines-privileges.md "27.2.2 Stored Routines and MySQL Privileges").

The `DEFINER` and `SQL SECURITY`
clauses specify the security context to be used when checking
access privileges at routine execution time, as described later in
this section.

If the routine name is the same as the name of a built-in SQL
function, a syntax error occurs unless you use a space between the
name and the following parenthesis when defining the routine or
invoking it later. For this reason, avoid using the names of
existing SQL functions for your own stored routines.

The [`IGNORE_SPACE`](sql-mode.md#sqlmode_ignore_space) SQL mode
applies to built-in functions, not to stored routines. It is
always permissible to have spaces after a stored routine name,
regardless of whether
[`IGNORE_SPACE`](sql-mode.md#sqlmode_ignore_space) is enabled.

`IF NOT EXISTS` prevents an error from occurring
if there already exists a routine with the same name. This option
is supported with both `CREATE FUNCTION` and
`CREATE PROCEDURE` beginning with MySQL 8.0.29.

If a built-in function with the same name already exists,
attempting to create a stored function with `CREATE
FUNCTION ... IF NOT EXISTS` succeeds with a warning
indicating that it has the same name as a native function; this is
no different than when performing the same `CREATE
FUNCTION` statement without specifying `IF NOT
EXISTS`.

If a loadable function with the same name already exists,
attempting to create a stored function using `IF NOT
EXISTS` succeeds with a warning. This is the same as
without specifying `IF NOT EXISTS`.

See [Function Name Resolution](function-resolution.md#function-name-resolution "Function Name Resolution"), for more
information.

The parameter list enclosed within parentheses must always be
present. If there are no parameters, an empty parameter list of
`()` should be used. Parameter names are not
case-sensitive.

Each parameter is an `IN` parameter by default.
To specify otherwise for a parameter, use the keyword
`OUT` or `INOUT` before the
parameter name.

Note

Specifying a parameter as `IN`,
`OUT`, or `INOUT` is valid
only for a `PROCEDURE`. For a
`FUNCTION`, parameters are always regarded as
`IN` parameters.

An `IN` parameter passes a value into a
procedure. The procedure might modify the value, but the
modification is not visible to the caller when the procedure
returns. An `OUT` parameter passes a value from
the procedure back to the caller. Its initial value is
`NULL` within the procedure, and its value is
visible to the caller when the procedure returns. An
`INOUT` parameter is initialized by the caller,
can be modified by the procedure, and any change made by the
procedure is visible to the caller when the procedure returns.

For each `OUT` or `INOUT`
parameter, pass a user-defined variable in the
[`CALL`](call.md "15.2.1 CALL Statement") statement that invokes the
procedure so that you can obtain its value when the procedure
returns. If you are calling the procedure from within another
stored procedure or function, you can also pass a routine
parameter or local routine variable as an `OUT`
or `INOUT` parameter. If you are calling the
procedure from within a trigger, you can also pass
`NEW.col_name` as an
`OUT` or `INOUT` parameter.

For information about the effect of unhandled conditions on
procedure parameters, see
[Section 15.6.7.8, “Condition Handling and OUT or INOUT Parameters”](conditions-and-parameters.md "15.6.7.8 Condition Handling and OUT or INOUT Parameters").

Routine parameters cannot be referenced in statements prepared
within the routine; see
[Section 27.8, “Restrictions on Stored Programs”](stored-program-restrictions.md "27.8 Restrictions on Stored Programs").

The following example shows a simple stored procedure that, given
a country code, counts the number of cities for that country that
appear in the `city` table of the
`world` database. The country code is passed
using an `IN` parameter, and the city count is
returned using an `OUT` parameter:

```sql
mysql> delimiter //

mysql> CREATE PROCEDURE citycount (IN country CHAR(3), OUT cities INT)
       BEGIN
         SELECT COUNT(*) INTO cities FROM world.city
         WHERE CountryCode = country;
       END//
Query OK, 0 rows affected (0.01 sec)

mysql> delimiter ;

mysql> CALL citycount('JPN', @cities); -- cities in Japan
Query OK, 1 row affected (0.00 sec)

mysql> SELECT @cities;
+---------+
| @cities |
+---------+
|     248 |
+---------+
1 row in set (0.00 sec)

mysql> CALL citycount('FRA', @cities); -- cities in France
Query OK, 1 row affected (0.00 sec)

mysql> SELECT @cities;
+---------+
| @cities |
+---------+
|      40 |
+---------+
1 row in set (0.00 sec)
```

The example uses the [**mysql**](mysql.md "6.5.1 mysql — The MySQL Command-Line Client") client
`delimiter` command to change the statement
delimiter from `;` to `//` while
the procedure is being defined. This enables the
`;` delimiter used in the procedure body to be
passed through to the server rather than being interpreted by
[**mysql**](mysql.md "6.5.1 mysql — The MySQL Command-Line Client") itself. See
[Section 27.1, “Defining Stored Programs”](stored-programs-defining.md "27.1 Defining Stored Programs").

The `RETURNS` clause may be specified only for a
`FUNCTION`, for which it is mandatory. It
indicates the return type of the function, and the function body
must contain a `RETURN
value` statement. If the
[`RETURN`](return.md "15.6.5.7 RETURN Statement") statement returns a value of
a different type, the value is coerced to the proper type. For
example, if a function specifies an
[`ENUM`](enum.md "13.3.5 The ENUM Type") or
[`SET`](set.md "13.3.6 The SET Type") value in the
`RETURNS` clause, but the
[`RETURN`](return.md "15.6.5.7 RETURN Statement") statement returns an
integer, the value returned from the function is the string for
the corresponding [`ENUM`](enum.md "13.3.5 The ENUM Type") member of
set of [`SET`](set.md "13.3.6 The SET Type") members.

The following example function takes a parameter, performs an
operation using an SQL function, and returns the result. In this
case, it is unnecessary to use `delimiter`
because the function definition contains no internal
`;` statement delimiters:

```sql
mysql> CREATE FUNCTION hello (s CHAR(20))
    ->   RETURNS CHAR(50) DETERMINISTIC
    ->   RETURN CONCAT('Hello, ',s,'!');
Query OK, 0 rows affected (0.00 sec)

mysql> SELECT hello('world');
+----------------+
| hello('world') |
+----------------+
| Hello, world!  |
+----------------+
1 row in set (0.00 sec)
```

Parameter types and function return types can be declared to use
any valid data type. The `COLLATE` attribute can
be used if preceded by a `CHARACTER SET`
specification.

The *`routine_body`* consists of a valid
SQL routine statement. This can be a simple statement such as
[`SELECT`](select.md "15.2.13 SELECT Statement") or
[`INSERT`](insert.md "15.2.7 INSERT Statement"), or a compound statement
written using `BEGIN` and `END`.
Compound statements can contain declarations, loops, and other
control structure statements. The syntax for these statements is
described in [Section 15.6, “Compound Statement Syntax”](sql-compound-statements.md "15.6 Compound Statement Syntax"). In
practice, stored functions tend to use compound statements, unless
the body consists of a single
[`RETURN`](return.md "15.6.5.7 RETURN Statement") statement.

MySQL permits routines to contain DDL statements, such as
`CREATE` and `DROP`. MySQL also
permits stored procedures (but not stored functions) to contain
SQL transaction statements such as
[`COMMIT`](commit.md "15.3.1 START TRANSACTION, COMMIT, and ROLLBACK Statements"). Stored functions may not
contain statements that perform explicit or implicit commit or
rollback. Support for these statements is not required by the SQL
standard, which states that each DBMS vendor may decide whether to
permit them.

Statements that return a result set can be used within a stored
procedure but not within a stored function. This prohibition
includes [`SELECT`](select.md "15.2.13 SELECT Statement") statements that do
not have an `INTO
var_list` clause and other
statements such as [`SHOW`](show.md "15.7.7 SHOW Statements"),
[`EXPLAIN`](explain.md "15.8.2 EXPLAIN Statement"), and
[`CHECK TABLE`](check-table.md "15.7.3.2 CHECK TABLE Statement"). For statements that
can be determined at function definition time to return a result
set, a `Not allowed to return a result set from a
function` error occurs
([`ER_SP_NO_RETSET`](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/mysql-errors/8.0/en/server-error-reference.html#error_er_sp_no_retset)). For statements
that can be determined only at runtime to return a result set, a
`PROCEDURE %s can't return a result set in the given
context` error occurs
([`ER_SP_BADSELECT`](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/mysql-errors/8.0/en/server-error-reference.html#error_er_sp_badselect)).

[`USE`](use.md "15.8.4 USE Statement") statements within stored
routines are not permitted. When a routine is invoked, an implicit
`USE db_name` is
performed (and undone when the routine terminates). The causes the
routine to have the given default database while it executes.
References to objects in databases other than the routine default
database should be qualified with the appropriate database name.

For additional information about statements that are not permitted
in stored routines, see
[Section 27.8, “Restrictions on Stored Programs”](stored-program-restrictions.md "27.8 Restrictions on Stored Programs").

For information about invoking stored procedures from within
programs written in a language that has a MySQL interface, see
[Section 15.2.1, “CALL Statement”](call.md "15.2.1 CALL Statement").

MySQL stores the [`sql_mode`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_sql_mode) system
variable setting in effect when a routine is created or altered,
and always executes the routine with this setting in force,
*regardless of the current server SQL mode when the
routine begins executing*.

The switch from the SQL mode of the invoker to that of the routine
occurs after evaluation of arguments and assignment of the
resulting values to routine parameters. If you define a routine in
strict SQL mode but invoke it in nonstrict mode, assignment of
arguments to routine parameters does not take place in strict
mode. If you require that expressions passed to a routine be
assigned in strict SQL mode, you should invoke the routine with
strict mode in effect.

The `COMMENT` characteristic is a MySQL
extension, and may be used to describe the stored routine. This
information is displayed by the [`SHOW CREATE
PROCEDURE`](show-create-procedure.md "15.7.7.9 SHOW CREATE PROCEDURE Statement") and [`SHOW CREATE
FUNCTION`](show-create-function.md "15.7.7.8 SHOW CREATE FUNCTION Statement") statements.

The `LANGUAGE` characteristic indicates the
language in which the routine is written. The server ignores this
characteristic; only SQL routines are supported.

A routine is considered “deterministic” if it always
produces the same result for the same input parameters, and
“not deterministic” otherwise. If neither
`DETERMINISTIC` nor `NOT
DETERMINISTIC` is given in the routine definition, the
default is `NOT DETERMINISTIC`. To declare that a
function is deterministic, you must specify
`DETERMINISTIC` explicitly.

Assessment of the nature of a routine is based on the
“honesty” of the creator: MySQL does not check that a
routine declared `DETERMINISTIC` is free of
statements that produce nondeterministic results. However,
misdeclaring a routine might affect results or affect performance.
Declaring a nondeterministic routine as
`DETERMINISTIC` might lead to unexpected results
by causing the optimizer to make incorrect execution plan choices.
Declaring a deterministic routine as
`NONDETERMINISTIC` might diminish performance by
causing available optimizations not to be used.

If binary logging is enabled, the `DETERMINISTIC`
characteristic affects which routine definitions MySQL accepts.
See [Section 27.7, “Stored Program Binary Logging”](stored-programs-logging.md "27.7 Stored Program Binary Logging").

A routine that contains the [`NOW()`](date-and-time-functions.md#function_now)
function (or its synonyms) or
[`RAND()`](mathematical-functions.md#function_rand) is nondeterministic, but it
might still be replication-safe. For
[`NOW()`](date-and-time-functions.md#function_now), the binary log includes the
timestamp and replicates correctly.
[`RAND()`](mathematical-functions.md#function_rand) also replicates correctly as
long as it is called only a single time during the execution of a
routine. (You can consider the routine execution timestamp and
random number seed as implicit inputs that are identical on the
source and replica.)

Several characteristics provide information about the nature of
data use by the routine. In MySQL, these characteristics are
advisory only. The server does not use them to constrain what
kinds of statements a routine is permitted to execute.

- `CONTAINS SQL` indicates that the routine
  does not contain statements that read or write data. This is
  the default if none of these characteristics is given
  explicitly. Examples of such statements are `SET @x =
  1` or `DO RELEASE_LOCK('abc')`,
  which execute but neither read nor write data.
- `NO SQL` indicates that the routine contains
  no SQL statements.
- `READS SQL DATA` indicates that the routine
  contains statements that read data (for example,
  [`SELECT`](select.md "15.2.13 SELECT Statement")), but not statements
  that write data.
- `MODIFIES SQL DATA` indicates that the
  routine contains statements that may write data (for example,
  [`INSERT`](insert.md "15.2.7 INSERT Statement") or
  [`DELETE`](delete.md "15.2.2 DELETE Statement")).

The `SQL SECURITY` characteristic can be
`DEFINER` or `INVOKER` to
specify the security context; that is, whether the routine
executes using the privileges of the account named in the routine
`DEFINER` clause or the user who invokes it. This
account must have permission to access the database with which the
routine is associated. The default value is
`DEFINER`. The user who invokes the routine must
have the [`EXECUTE`](privileges-provided.md#priv_execute) privilege for it,
as must the `DEFINER` account if the routine
executes in definer security context.

The `DEFINER` clause specifies the MySQL account
to be used when checking access privileges at routine execution
time for routines that have the `SQL SECURITY
DEFINER` characteristic.

If the `DEFINER` clause is present, the
*`user`* value should be a MySQL account
specified as
`'user_name'@'host_name'`,
[`CURRENT_USER`](information-functions.md#function_current-user), or
[`CURRENT_USER()`](information-functions.md#function_current-user). The permitted
*`user`* values depend on the privileges
you hold, as discussed in
[Section 27.6, “Stored Object Access Control”](stored-objects-security.md "27.6 Stored Object Access Control"). Also see that section
for additional information about stored routine security.

If the `DEFINER` clause is omitted, the default
definer is the user who executes the [`CREATE
PROCEDURE`](create-procedure.md "15.1.17 CREATE PROCEDURE and CREATE FUNCTION Statements") or [`CREATE
FUNCTION`](create-function.md "15.1.14 CREATE FUNCTION Statement") statement. This is the same as specifying
`DEFINER = CURRENT_USER` explicitly.

Within the body of a stored routine that is defined with the
`SQL SECURITY DEFINER` characteristic, the
[`CURRENT_USER`](information-functions.md#function_current-user) function returns the
routine's `DEFINER` value. For information about
user auditing within stored routines, see
[Section 8.2.23, “SQL-Based Account Activity Auditing”](account-activity-auditing.md "8.2.23 SQL-Based Account Activity Auditing").

Consider the following procedure, which displays a count of the
number of MySQL accounts listed in the
`mysql.user` system table:

```sql
CREATE DEFINER = 'admin'@'localhost' PROCEDURE account_count()
BEGIN
  SELECT 'Number of accounts:', COUNT(*) FROM mysql.user;
END;
```

The procedure is assigned a `DEFINER` account of
`'admin'@'localhost'` no matter which user
defines it. It executes with the privileges of that account no
matter which user invokes it (because the default security
characteristic is `DEFINER`). The procedure
succeeds or fails depending on whether invoker has the
[`EXECUTE`](privileges-provided.md#priv_execute) privilege for it and
`'admin'@'localhost'` has the
[`SELECT`](privileges-provided.md#priv_select) privilege for the
`mysql.user` table.

Now suppose that the procedure is defined with the `SQL
SECURITY INVOKER` characteristic:

```sql
CREATE DEFINER = 'admin'@'localhost' PROCEDURE account_count()
SQL SECURITY INVOKER
BEGIN
  SELECT 'Number of accounts:', COUNT(*) FROM mysql.user;
END;
```

The procedure still has a `DEFINER` of
`'admin'@'localhost'`, but in this case, it
executes with the privileges of the invoking user. Thus, the
procedure succeeds or fails depending on whether the invoker has
the [`EXECUTE`](privileges-provided.md#priv_execute) privilege for it and
the [`SELECT`](privileges-provided.md#priv_select) privilege for the
`mysql.user` table.

By default, when a routine with the `SQL SECURITY
DEFINER` characteristic is executed, MySQL Server does
not set any active roles for the MySQL account named in the
`DEFINER` clause, only the default roles. The
exception is if the
[`activate_all_roles_on_login`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_activate_all_roles_on_login)
system variable is enabled, in which case MySQL Server sets all
roles granted to the `DEFINER` user, including
mandatory roles. Any privileges granted through roles are
therefore not checked by default when the
[`CREATE PROCEDURE`](create-procedure.md "15.1.17 CREATE PROCEDURE and CREATE FUNCTION Statements") or
[`CREATE FUNCTION`](create-function.md "15.1.14 CREATE FUNCTION Statement") statement
is issued. For stored programs, if execution should occur with
roles different from the default, the program body can execute
[`SET ROLE`](set-role.md "15.7.1.11 SET ROLE Statement") to activate the required
roles. This must be done with caution since the privileges
assigned to roles can be changed.

The server handles the data type of a routine parameter, local
routine variable created with
[`DECLARE`](declare.md "15.6.3 DECLARE Statement"), or function return value
as follows:

- Assignments are checked for data type mismatches and overflow.
  Conversion and overflow problems result in warnings, or errors
  in strict SQL mode.
- Only scalar values can be assigned. For example, a statement
  such as `SET x = (SELECT 1, 2)` is invalid.
- For character data types, if `CHARACTER SET`
  is included in the declaration, the specified character set
  and its default collation is used. If the
  `COLLATE` attribute is also present, that
  collation is used rather than the default collation.

  If `CHARACTER SET` and
  `COLLATE` are not present, the database
  character set and collation in effect at routine creation time
  are used. To avoid having the server use the database
  character set and collation, provide an explicit
  `CHARACTER SET` and a
  `COLLATE` attribute for character data
  parameters.

  If you alter the database default character set or collation,
  stored routines that are to use the new database defaults must
  be dropped and recreated.

  The database character set and collation are given by the
  value of the
  [`character_set_database`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_character_set_database) and
  [`collation_database`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_collation_database) system
  variables. For more information, see
  [Section 12.3.3, “Database Character Set and Collation”](charset-database.md "12.3.3 Database Character Set and Collation").
