#### 15.2.7.2 INSERT ... ON DUPLICATE KEY UPDATE Statement

If you specify an `ON DUPLICATE KEY UPDATE`
clause and a row to be inserted would cause a duplicate value in
a `UNIQUE` index or `PRIMARY
KEY`, an [`UPDATE`](update.md "15.2.17 UPDATE Statement") of the
old row occurs. For example, if column `a` is
declared as `UNIQUE` and contains the value
`1`, the following two statements have similar
effect:

```sql
INSERT INTO t1 (a,b,c) VALUES (1,2,3)
  ON DUPLICATE KEY UPDATE c=c+1;

UPDATE t1 SET c=c+1 WHERE a=1;
```

The effects are not quite identical: For an
`InnoDB` table where `a` is an
auto-increment column, the `INSERT` statement
increases the auto-increment value but the
`UPDATE` does not.

If column `b` is also unique, the
[`INSERT`](insert.md "15.2.7 INSERT Statement") is equivalent to this
[`UPDATE`](update.md "15.2.17 UPDATE Statement") statement instead:

```sql
UPDATE t1 SET c=c+1 WHERE a=1 OR b=2 LIMIT 1;
```

If `a=1 OR b=2` matches several rows, only
*one* row is updated. In general, you should
try to avoid using an `ON DUPLICATE KEY UPDATE`
clause on tables with multiple unique indexes.

With `ON DUPLICATE KEY UPDATE`, the
affected-rows value per row is 1 if the row is inserted as a new
row, 2 if an existing row is updated, and 0 if an existing row
is set to its current values. If you specify the
`CLIENT_FOUND_ROWS` flag to the
[`mysql_real_connect()`](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/c-api/8.0/en/mysql-real-connect.html) C API
function when connecting to [**mysqld**](mysqld.md "6.3.1 mysqld — The MySQL Server"), the
affected-rows value is 1 (not 0) if an existing row is set to
its current values.

If a table contains an `AUTO_INCREMENT` column
and [`INSERT
... ON DUPLICATE KEY UPDATE`](insert-on-duplicate.md "15.2.7.2 INSERT ... ON DUPLICATE KEY UPDATE Statement") inserts or updates a row,
the [`LAST_INSERT_ID()`](information-functions.md#function_last-insert-id) function
returns the `AUTO_INCREMENT` value.

The `ON DUPLICATE KEY UPDATE` clause can
contain multiple column assignments, separated by commas.

It is possible to use `IGNORE` with `ON
DUPLICATE KEY UPDATE` in an `INSERT`
statement, but this may not behave as you expect when inserting
multiple rows into a table that has multiple unique keys. This
becomes apparent when an updated value is itself a duplicate key
value. Consider the table `t`, created and
populated by the statements shown here:

```sql
mysql> CREATE TABLE t (a SERIAL, b BIGINT NOT NULL, UNIQUE KEY (b));;
Query OK, 0 rows affected (0.03 sec)

mysql> INSERT INTO t VALUES ROW(1,1), ROW(2,2);
Query OK, 2 rows affected (0.01 sec)
Records: 2  Duplicates: 0  Warnings: 0

mysql> TABLE t;
+---+---+
| a | b |
+---+---+
| 1 | 1 |
| 2 | 2 |
+---+---+
2 rows in set (0.00 sec)
```

Now we attempt to insert two rows, one of which contains a
duplicate key value, using `ON DUPLICATE KEY
UPDATE`, where the `UPDATE` clause
itself results in a duplicate key value:

```sql
mysql> INSERT INTO t VALUES ROW(2,3), ROW(3,3) ON DUPLICATE KEY UPDATE a=a+1, b=b-1;
ERROR 1062 (23000): Duplicate entry '1' for key 't.b'
mysql> TABLE t;
+---+---+
| a | b |
+---+---+
| 1 | 1 |
| 2 | 2 |
+---+---+
2 rows in set (0.00 sec)
```

The first row contains a duplicate value for one of the
table's unique keys (column `a`), but
`b=b+1` in the `UPDATE` clause
results in a unique key violation for column
`b`; the statement is immediately rejected with
an error, and no rows are updated. Let us repeat the statement,
this time adding the **`IGNORE`** keyword, like
this:

```sql
mysql> INSERT IGNORE INTO t VALUES ROW(2,3), ROW(3,3)
    -> ON DUPLICATE KEY UPDATE a=a+1, b=b-1;
Query OK, 1 row affected, 1 warning (0.00 sec)
Records: 2  Duplicates: 1  Warnings: 1
```

This time, the previous error is demoted to a warning, as shown
here:

```sql
mysql> SHOW WARNINGS;
+---------+------+-----------------------------------+
| Level   | Code | Message                           |
+---------+------+-----------------------------------+
| Warning | 1062 | Duplicate entry '1' for key 't.b' |
+---------+------+-----------------------------------+
1 row in set (0.00 sec)
```

Because the statement was not rejected, execution continues.
This means that the second row is inserted into
`t`, as we can see here:

```sql
mysql> TABLE t;
+---+---+
| a | b |
+---+---+
| 1 | 1 |
| 2 | 2 |
| 3 | 3 |
+---+---+
3 rows in set (0.00 sec)
```

In assignment value expressions in the `ON DUPLICATE KEY
UPDATE` clause, you can use the
[`VALUES(col_name)`](miscellaneous-functions.md#function_values)
function to refer to column values from the
[`INSERT`](insert.md "15.2.7 INSERT Statement") portion of the
[`INSERT ...
ON DUPLICATE KEY UPDATE`](insert-on-duplicate.md "15.2.7.2 INSERT ... ON DUPLICATE KEY UPDATE Statement") statement. In other words,
[`VALUES(col_name)`](miscellaneous-functions.md#function_values)
in the `ON DUPLICATE KEY UPDATE` clause refers
to the value of *`col_name`* that would
be inserted, had no duplicate-key conflict occurred. This
function is especially useful in multiple-row inserts. The
[`VALUES()`](miscellaneous-functions.md#function_values) function is meaningful
only as an introducer for `INSERT` statement
value lists, or in the `ON DUPLICATE KEY
UPDATE` clause of an
[`INSERT`](insert.md "15.2.7 INSERT Statement") statement, and returns
`NULL` otherwise. For example:

```sql
INSERT INTO t1 (a,b,c) VALUES (1,2,3),(4,5,6)
  ON DUPLICATE KEY UPDATE c=VALUES(a)+VALUES(b);
```

That statement is identical to the following two statements:

```sql
INSERT INTO t1 (a,b,c) VALUES (1,2,3)
  ON DUPLICATE KEY UPDATE c=3;
INSERT INTO t1 (a,b,c) VALUES (4,5,6)
  ON DUPLICATE KEY UPDATE c=9;
```

Note

The use of [`VALUES()`](miscellaneous-functions.md#function_values) to refer to
the new row and columns is deprecated beginning with MySQL
8.0.20, and is subject to removal in a future version of
MySQL. Instead, use row and column aliases, as described in
the next few paragraphs of this section.

Beginning with MySQL 8.0.19, it is possible to use an alias for
the row, with, optionally, one or more of its columns to be
inserted, following the `VALUES` or
`SET` clause, and preceded by the
`AS` keyword. Using the row alias
`new`, the statement shown previously using
`VALUES()` to access the new column values can
be written in the form shown here:

```sql
INSERT INTO t1 (a,b,c) VALUES (1,2,3),(4,5,6) AS new
  ON DUPLICATE KEY UPDATE c = new.a+new.b;
```

If, in addition, you use the column aliases
`m`, `n`, and
`p`, you can omit the row alias in the
assignment clause and write the same statement like this:

```sql
INSERT INTO t1 (a,b,c) VALUES (1,2,3),(4,5,6) AS new(m,n,p)
  ON DUPLICATE KEY UPDATE c = m+n;
```

When using column aliases in this fashion, you must still use a
row alias following the `VALUES` clause, even
if you do not make direct use of it in the assignment clause.

Beginning with MySQL 8.0.20, an `INSERT ... SELECT ...
ON DUPLICATE KEY UPDATE` statement that uses
`VALUES()` in the `UPDATE`
clause, like this one, throws a warning:

```sql
INSERT INTO t1
  SELECT c, c+d FROM t2
  ON DUPLICATE KEY UPDATE b = VALUES(b);
```

You can eliminate such warnings by using a subquery instead,
like this:

```sql
INSERT INTO t1
  SELECT * FROM (SELECT c, c+d AS e FROM t2) AS dt
  ON DUPLICATE KEY UPDATE b = e;
```

You can also use row and column aliases with a
`SET` clause, as mentioned previously.
Employing `SET` instead of
`VALUES` in the two `INSERT ... ON
DUPLICATE KEY UPDATE` statements just shown can be done
as shown here:

```sql
INSERT INTO t1 SET a=1,b=2,c=3 AS new
  ON DUPLICATE KEY UPDATE c = new.a+new.b;

INSERT INTO t1 SET a=1,b=2,c=3 AS new(m,n,p)
  ON DUPLICATE KEY UPDATE c = m+n;
```

The row alias must not be the same as the name of the table. If
column aliases are not used, or if they are the same as the
column names, they must be distinguished using the row alias in
the `ON DUPLICATE KEY UPDATE` clause. Column
aliases must be unique with regard to the row alias to which
they apply (that is, no column aliases referring to columns of
the same row may be the same).

For [`INSERT
... SELECT`](insert-on-duplicate.md "15.2.7.2 INSERT ... ON DUPLICATE KEY UPDATE Statement") statements, these rules apply regarding
acceptable forms of `SELECT` query expressions
that you can refer to in an `ON DUPLICATE KEY
UPDATE` clause:

- References to columns from queries on a single table, which
  may be a derived table.
- References to columns from queries on a join over multiple
  tables.
- References to columns from `DISTINCT`
  queries.
- References to columns in other tables, as long as the
  [`SELECT`](select.md "15.2.13 SELECT Statement") does not use
  `GROUP BY`. One side effect is that you
  must qualify references to nonunique column names.

References to columns from a
[`UNION`](union.md "15.2.18 UNION Clause") are not supported. To work
around this restriction, rewrite the
[`UNION`](union.md "15.2.18 UNION Clause") as a derived table so that
its rows can be treated as a single-table result set. For
example, this statement produces an error:

```sql
INSERT INTO t1 (a, b)
  SELECT c, d FROM t2
  UNION
  SELECT e, f FROM t3
ON DUPLICATE KEY UPDATE b = b + c;
```

Instead, use an equivalent statement that rewrites the
[`UNION`](union.md "15.2.18 UNION Clause") as a derived table:

```sql
INSERT INTO t1 (a, b)
SELECT * FROM
  (SELECT c, d FROM t2
   UNION
   SELECT e, f FROM t3) AS dt
ON DUPLICATE KEY UPDATE b = b + c;
```

The technique of rewriting a query as a derived table also
enables references to columns from `GROUP BY`
queries.

Because the results of
[`INSERT ...
SELECT`](insert-select.md "15.2.7.1 INSERT ... SELECT Statement") statements depend on the ordering of rows from
the [`SELECT`](select.md "15.2.13 SELECT Statement") and this order cannot
always be guaranteed, it is possible when logging
[`INSERT ...
SELECT ON DUPLICATE KEY UPDATE`](insert-on-duplicate.md "15.2.7.2 INSERT ... ON DUPLICATE KEY UPDATE Statement") statements for the
source and the replica to diverge. Thus,
[`INSERT ...
SELECT ON DUPLICATE KEY UPDATE`](insert-on-duplicate.md "15.2.7.2 INSERT ... ON DUPLICATE KEY UPDATE Statement") statements are flagged
as unsafe for statement-based replication. Such statements
produce a warning in the error log when using statement-based
mode and are written to the binary log using the row-based
format when using `MIXED` mode. An
[`INSERT ...
ON DUPLICATE KEY UPDATE`](insert-on-duplicate.md "15.2.7.2 INSERT ... ON DUPLICATE KEY UPDATE Statement") statement against a table
having more than one unique or primary key is also marked as
unsafe. (Bug #11765650, Bug #58637)

Replication”](replication-sbr-rbr.md "19.2.1.1 Advantages and Disadvantages of Statement-Based and Row-Based Replication").
