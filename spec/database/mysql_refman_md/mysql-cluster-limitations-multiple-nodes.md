#### 25.2.7.10 Limitations Relating to Multiple NDB Cluster Nodes

**Multiple SQL nodes.**
The following are issues relating to the use of multiple MySQL
servers as NDB Cluster SQL nodes, and are specific to the
[`NDBCLUSTER`](mysql-cluster.md "Chapter 25 MySQL NDB Cluster 8.0") storage engine:

- **Stored programs not distributed.**
  Stored procedures, stored functions, triggers, and
  scheduled events are all supported by tables using the
  [`NDB`](mysql-cluster.md "Chapter 25 MySQL NDB Cluster 8.0") storage engine, but these
  do *not* propagate automatically
  between MySQL Servers acting as Cluster SQL nodes, and
  must be re-created separately on each SQL node. See
  [Stored routines and triggers in NDB Cluster](stored-program-restrictions.md#stored-routines-ndbcluster "Stored routines and triggers in NDB Cluster").
- **No distributed table locks.**
  A [`LOCK TABLES`](lock-tables.md "15.3.6 LOCK TABLES and UNLOCK TABLES Statements") statement or
  [`GET_LOCK()`](locking-functions.md#function_get-lock) call works only
  for the SQL node on which the lock is issued; no other SQL
  node in the cluster “sees” this lock. This is
  true for a lock issued by any statement that locks tables
  as part of its operations. (See next item for an example.)

  Implementing table locks in `NDBCLUSTER`
  can be done in an API application, and ensuring that all
  applications start by setting
  [`LockMode`](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/ndbapi/en/ndb-ndboperation.html#ndb-ndboperation-lockmode) to
  `LM_Read` or
  `LM_Exclusive`. For more information about
  how to do this, see the description of
  [`NdbOperation::getLockHandle()`](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/ndbapi/en/ndb-ndboperation.html#ndb-ndboperation-getlockhandle)
  in the *NDB Cluster API Guide*.
- **ALTER TABLE operations.**
  [`ALTER TABLE`](alter-table.md "15.1.9 ALTER TABLE Statement") is not fully
  locking when running multiple MySQL servers (SQL nodes).
  (As discussed in the previous item, NDB Cluster does not
  support distributed table locks.)

**Multiple management nodes.**
When using multiple management servers:

- If any of the management servers are running on the same
  host, you must give nodes explicit IDs in connection strings
  because automatic allocation of node IDs does not work
  across multiple management servers on the same host. This is
  not required if every management server resides on a
  different host.
- When a management server starts, it first checks for any
  other management server in the same NDB Cluster, and upon
  successful connection to the other management server uses
  its configuration data. This means that the management
  server [`--reload`](mysql-cluster-programs-ndb-mgmd.md#option_ndb_mgmd_reload) and
  [`--initial`](mysql-cluster-programs-ndb-mgmd.md#option_ndb_mgmd_initial) startup options
  are ignored unless the management server is the only one
  running. It also means that, when performing a rolling
  restart of an NDB Cluster with multiple management nodes,
  the management server reads its own configuration file if
  (and only if) it is the only management server running in
  this NDB Cluster. See
  [Section 25.6.5, “Performing a Rolling Restart of an NDB Cluster”](mysql-cluster-rolling-restart.md "25.6.5 Performing a Rolling Restart of an NDB Cluster"), for more
  information.

**Multiple network addresses.**
Multiple network addresses per data node are not supported.
Use of these is liable to cause problems: In the event of a
data node failure, an SQL node waits for confirmation that the
data node went down but never receives it because another
route to that data node remains open. This can effectively
make the cluster inoperable.

Note

It is possible to use multiple network hardware
*interfaces* (such as Ethernet cards) for a
single data node, but these must be bound to the same address.
This also means that it not possible to use more than one
`[tcp]` section per connection in the
`config.ini` file. See
[Section 25.4.3.10, “NDB Cluster TCP/IP Connections”](mysql-cluster-tcp-definition.md "25.4.3.10 NDB Cluster TCP/IP Connections"), for more
information.
