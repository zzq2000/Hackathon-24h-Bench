[7.4.4.5 Binary Log Transaction Compression](binary-log-transaction-compression.md)

The binary log contains “events” that describe
database changes such as table creation operations or changes to
table data. It also contains events for statements that
potentially could have made changes (for example, a
[`DELETE`](delete.md "15.2.2 DELETE Statement") which matched no rows),
unless row-based logging is used. The binary log also contains
information about how long each statement took that updated data.
The binary log has two important purposes:

- For replication, the binary log on a replication source server
  provides a record of the data changes to be sent to replicas.
  The source sends the information contained in its binary log
  to its replicas, which reproduce those transactions to make
  the same data changes that were made on the source. See
  [Section 19.2, “Replication Implementation”](replication-implementation.md "19.2 Replication Implementation").
- Certain data recovery operations require use of the binary
  log. After a backup has been restored, the events in the
  binary log that were recorded after the backup was made are
  re-executed. These events bring databases up to date from the
  point of the backup. See
  [Section 9.5, “Point-in-Time (Incremental) Recovery”](point-in-time-recovery.md "9.5 Point-in-Time (Incremental) Recovery").

The binary log is not used for statements such as
[`SELECT`](select.md "15.2.13 SELECT Statement") or
[`SHOW`](show.md "15.7.7 SHOW Statements") that do not modify data. To
log all statements (for example, to identify a problem query), use
the general query log. See [Section 7.4.3, “The General Query Log”](query-log.md "7.4.3 The General Query Log").

Running a server with binary logging enabled makes performance
slightly slower. However, the benefits of the binary log in
enabling you to set up replication and for restore operations
generally outweigh this minor performance decrement.

The binary log is resilient to unexpected halts. Only complete
events or transactions are logged or read back.

Passwords in statements written to the binary log are rewritten by
the server not to occur literally in plain text. See also
[Section 8.1.2.3, “Passwords and Logging”](password-logging.md "8.1.2.3 Passwords and Logging").

From MySQL 8.0.14, binary log files and relay log files can be
encrypted, helping to protect these files and the potentially
sensitive data contained in them from being misused by outside
attackers, and also from unauthorized viewing by users of the
operating system where they are stored. You enable encryption on a
MySQL server by setting the
[`binlog_encryption`](replication-options-binary-log.md#sysvar_binlog_encryption) system variable
to `ON`. For more information, see
[Section 19.3.2, “Encrypting Binary Log Files and Relay Log Files”](replication-binlog-encryption.md "19.3.2 Encrypting Binary Log Files and Relay Log Files").

The following discussion describes some of the server options and
variables that affect the operation of binary logging. For a
complete list, see
[Section 19.1.6.4, “Binary Logging Options and Variables”](replication-options-binary-log.md "19.1.6.4 Binary Logging Options and Variables").

Binary logging is enabled by default (the
[`log_bin`](replication-options-binary-log.md#sysvar_log_bin) system variable is set to
ON). The exception is if you use [**mysqld**](mysqld.md "6.3.1 mysqld — The MySQL Server") to
initialize the data directory manually by invoking it with the
[`--initialize`](server-options.md#option_mysqld_initialize) or
[`--initialize-insecure`](server-options.md#option_mysqld_initialize-insecure) option, when
binary logging is disabled by default, but can be enabled by
specifying the [`--log-bin`](replication-options-binary-log.md#option_mysqld_log-bin) option.

To disable binary logging, you can specify the
[`--skip-log-bin`](replication-options-binary-log.md#option_mysqld_log-bin)
or
[`--disable-log-bin`](replication-options-binary-log.md#option_mysqld_log-bin)
option at startup. If either of these options is specified and
[`--log-bin`](replication-options-binary-log.md#option_mysqld_log-bin) is also specified, the
option specified later takes precedence.

The [`--log-slave-updates`](replication-options-binary-log.md#sysvar_log_slave_updates) and
[`--slave-preserve-commit-order`](replication-options-replica.md#sysvar_slave_preserve_commit_order)
options require binary logging. If you disable binary logging,
either omit these options, or specify
[`--log-slave-updates=OFF`](replication-options-binary-log.md#sysvar_log_slave_updates) and
[`--skip-slave-preserve-commit-order`](replication-options-replica.md#sysvar_slave_preserve_commit_order).
MySQL disables these options by default when
[`--skip-log-bin`](replication-options-binary-log.md#option_mysqld_log-bin)
or
[`--disable-log-bin`](replication-options-binary-log.md#option_mysqld_log-bin)
is specified. If you specify
[`--log-slave-updates`](replication-options-binary-log.md#sysvar_log_slave_updates) or
[`--slave-preserve-commit-order`](replication-options-replica.md#sysvar_slave_preserve_commit_order)
together with
[`--skip-log-bin`](replication-options-binary-log.md#option_mysqld_log-bin)
or
[`--disable-log-bin`](replication-options-binary-log.md#option_mysqld_log-bin),
a warning or error message is issued.

The
[`--log-bin[=base_name]`](replication-options-binary-log.md#option_mysqld_log-bin)
option is used to specify the base name for binary log files. If
you do not supply the `--log-bin` option, MySQL
uses `binlog` as the default base name for the
binary log files. For compatibility with earlier releases, if you
supply the `--log-bin` option with no string or
with an empty string, the base name defaults to
`host_name-bin`,
using the name of the host machine. It is recommended that you
specify a base name, so that if the host name changes, you can
easily continue to use the same binary log file names (see
[Section B.3.7, “Known Issues in MySQL”](known-issues.md "B.3.7 Known Issues in MySQL")). If you supply an extension in the
log name (for example,
[`--log-bin=base_name.extension`](replication-options-binary-log.md#option_mysqld_log-bin)),
the extension is silently removed and ignored.

[**mysqld**](mysqld.md "6.3.1 mysqld — The MySQL Server") appends a numeric extension to the
binary log base name to generate binary log file names. The number
increases each time the server creates a new log file, thus
creating an ordered series of files. The server creates a new file
in the series each time any of the following events occurs:

- The server is started or restarted
- The server flushes the logs.
- The size of the current log file reaches
  [`max_binlog_size`](replication-options-binary-log.md#sysvar_max_binlog_size).

A binary log file may become larger than
[`max_binlog_size`](replication-options-binary-log.md#sysvar_max_binlog_size) if you are using
large transactions because a transaction is written to the file in
one piece, never split between files.

To keep track of which binary log files have been used,
[**mysqld**](mysqld.md "6.3.1 mysqld — The MySQL Server") also creates a binary log index file
that contains the names of the binary log files. By default, this
has the same base name as the binary log file, with the extension
`'.index'`. You can change the name of the binary
log index file with the
[`--log-bin-index[=file_name]`](replication-options-binary-log.md#option_mysqld_log-bin-index)
option. You should not manually edit this file while
[**mysqld**](mysqld.md "6.3.1 mysqld — The MySQL Server") is running; doing so would confuse
[**mysqld**](mysqld.md "6.3.1 mysqld — The MySQL Server").

The term “binary log file” generally denotes an
individual numbered file containing database events. The term
“binary log” collectively denotes the set of numbered
binary log files plus the index file.

The default location for binary log files and the binary log index
file is the data directory. You can use the
[`--log-bin`](replication-options-binary-log.md#option_mysqld_log-bin) option to specify an
alternative location, by adding a leading absolute path name to
the base name to specify a different directory. When the server
reads an entry from the binary log index file, which tracks the
binary log files that have been used, it checks whether the entry
contains a relative path. If it does, the relative part of the
path is replaced with the absolute path set using the
[`--log-bin`](replication-options-binary-log.md#option_mysqld_log-bin) option. An absolute path
recorded in the binary log index file remains unchanged; in such a
case, the index file must be edited manually to enable a new path
or paths to be used. The binary log file base name and any
specified path are available as the
[`log_bin_basename`](replication-options-binary-log.md#sysvar_log_bin_basename) system variable.

In MySQL 5.7, a server ID had to be specified when binary logging
was enabled, or the server would not start. In MySQL
8.0, the [`server_id`](replication-options.md#sysvar_server_id)
system variable is set to 1 by default. The server can be started
with this default ID when binary logging is enabled, but an
informational message is issued if you do not specify a server ID
explicitly using the [`server_id`](replication-options.md#sysvar_server_id)
system variable. For servers that are used in a replication
topology, you must specify a unique nonzero server ID for each
server.

A client that has privileges sufficient to set restricted session
system variables (see
[Section 7.1.9.1, “System Variable Privileges”](system-variable-privileges.md "7.1.9.1 System Variable Privileges")) can disable binary
logging of its own statements by using a
[`SET
sql_log_bin=OFF`](set-sql-log-bin.md "15.4.1.3 SET sql_log_bin Statement") statement.

By default, the server logs the length of the event as well as the
event itself and uses this to verify that the event was written
correctly. You can also cause the server to write checksums for
the events by setting the
[`binlog_checksum`](replication-options-binary-log.md#sysvar_binlog_checksum) system variable.
When reading back from the binary log, the source uses the event
length by default, but can be made to use checksums if available
by enabling the system variable
[`source_verify_checksum`](replication-options-binary-log.md#sysvar_source_verify_checksum) (from
MySQL 8.0.26) or
[`master_verify_checksum`](replication-options-binary-log.md#sysvar_master_verify_checksum) (before
MySQL 8.0.26). The replication I/O (receiver) thread on the
replica also verifies events received from the source. You can
cause the replication SQL (applier) thread to use checksums if
available when reading from the relay log by enabling the system
variable
[`replica_sql_verify_checksum`](replication-options-replica.md#sysvar_replica_sql_verify_checksum) (from
MySQL 8.0.26) or
[`slave_sql_verify_checksum`](replication-options-replica.md#sysvar_slave_sql_verify_checksum) (before
MySQL 8.0.26).

The format of the events recorded in the binary log is dependent
on the binary logging format. Three format types are supported:
row-based logging, statement-based logging and mixed-base logging.
The binary logging format used depends on the MySQL version. For
general descriptions of the logging formats, see
[Section 7.4.4.1, “Binary Logging Formats”](binary-log-formats.md "7.4.4.1 Binary Logging Formats"). For detailed information
about the format of the binary log, see
[MySQL Internals:
The Binary Log](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/internals/en/binary-log.html).

The server evaluates the
[`--binlog-do-db`](replication-options-binary-log.md#option_mysqld_binlog-do-db) and
[`--binlog-ignore-db`](replication-options-binary-log.md#option_mysqld_binlog-ignore-db) options in the
same way as it does the
[`--replicate-do-db`](replication-options-replica.md#option_mysqld_replicate-do-db) and
[`--replicate-ignore-db`](replication-options-replica.md#option_mysqld_replicate-ignore-db) options. For
information about how this is done, see
[Section 19.2.5.1, “Evaluation of Database-Level Replication and Binary Logging Options”](replication-rules-db-options.md "19.2.5.1 Evaluation of Database-Level Replication and Binary Logging Options").

A replica is started with the system variable
[`log_replica_updates`](replication-options-binary-log.md#sysvar_log_replica_updates) (from MySQL
8.0.26) or [`log_slave_updates`](replication-options-binary-log.md#sysvar_log_slave_updates)
(before MySQL 8.0.26) enabled by default, meaning that the replica
writes to its own binary log any data modifications that are
received from the source. The binary log must be enabled for this
setting to work (see
[Section 19.1.6.3, “Replica Server Options and Variables”](replication-options-replica.md "19.1.6.3 Replica Server Options and Variables")). This setting
enables the replica to act as a source to other replicas.

You can delete all binary log files with the
[`RESET MASTER`](reset-master.md "15.4.1.2 RESET MASTER Statement") statement, or a subset
of them with [`PURGE BINARY LOGS`](purge-binary-logs.md "15.4.1.1 PURGE BINARY LOGS Statement"). See
[Section 15.7.8.6, “RESET Statement”](reset.md "15.7.8.6 RESET Statement"), and [Section 15.4.1.1, “PURGE BINARY LOGS Statement”](purge-binary-logs.md "15.4.1.1 PURGE BINARY LOGS Statement").

If you are using replication, you should not delete old binary log
files on the source until you are sure that no replica still needs
to use them. For example, if your replicas never run more than
three days behind, once a day you can execute [**mysqladmin
flush-logs binary**](mysqladmin.md "6.5.2 mysqladmin — A MySQL Server Administration Program") on the source and then remove any logs
that are more than three days old. You can remove the files
manually, but it is preferable to use [`PURGE
BINARY LOGS`](purge-binary-logs.md "15.4.1.1 PURGE BINARY LOGS Statement"), which also safely updates the binary log
index file for you (and which can take a date argument). See
[Section 15.4.1.1, “PURGE BINARY LOGS Statement”](purge-binary-logs.md "15.4.1.1 PURGE BINARY LOGS Statement").

You can display the contents of binary log files with the
[**mysqlbinlog**](mysqlbinlog.md "6.6.9 mysqlbinlog — Utility for Processing Binary Log Files") utility. This can be useful when
you want to reprocess statements in the log for a recovery
operation. For example, you can update a MySQL server from the
binary log as follows:

```terminal
$> mysqlbinlog log_file | mysql -h server_name
```

[**mysqlbinlog**](mysqlbinlog.md "6.6.9 mysqlbinlog — Utility for Processing Binary Log Files") also can be used to display the
contents of the relay log file on a replica, because they are
written using the same format as binary log files. For more
information on the [**mysqlbinlog**](mysqlbinlog.md "6.6.9 mysqlbinlog — Utility for Processing Binary Log Files") utility and how
to use it, see [Section 6.6.9, “mysqlbinlog — Utility for Processing Binary Log Files”](mysqlbinlog.md "6.6.9 mysqlbinlog — Utility for Processing Binary Log Files"). For more information
about the binary log and recovery operations, see
[Section 9.5, “Point-in-Time (Incremental) Recovery”](point-in-time-recovery.md "9.5 Point-in-Time (Incremental) Recovery").

Binary logging is done immediately after a statement or
transaction completes but before any locks are released or any
commit is done. This ensures that the log is logged in commit
order.

Updates to nontransactional tables are stored in the binary log
immediately after execution.

Within an uncommitted transaction, all updates
([`UPDATE`](update.md "15.2.17 UPDATE Statement"),
[`DELETE`](delete.md "15.2.2 DELETE Statement"), or
[`INSERT`](insert.md "15.2.7 INSERT Statement")) that change transactional
tables such as `InnoDB` tables are cached until a
[`COMMIT`](commit.md "15.3.1 START TRANSACTION, COMMIT, and ROLLBACK Statements") statement is received by the
server. At that point, [**mysqld**](mysqld.md "6.3.1 mysqld — The MySQL Server") writes the entire
transaction to the binary log before the
[`COMMIT`](commit.md "15.3.1 START TRANSACTION, COMMIT, and ROLLBACK Statements") is executed.

Modifications to nontransactional tables cannot be rolled back. If
a transaction that is rolled back includes modifications to
nontransactional tables, the entire transaction is logged with a
[`ROLLBACK`](commit.md "15.3.1 START TRANSACTION, COMMIT, and ROLLBACK Statements")
statement at the end to ensure that the modifications to those
tables are replicated.

When a thread that handles the transaction starts, it allocates a
buffer of [`binlog_cache_size`](replication-options-binary-log.md#sysvar_binlog_cache_size) to
buffer statements. If a statement is bigger than this, the thread
opens a temporary file to store the transaction. The temporary
file is deleted when the thread ends. From MySQL 8.0.17, if binary
log encryption is active on the server, the temporary file is
encrypted.

The [`Binlog_cache_use`](server-status-variables.md#statvar_Binlog_cache_use) status
variable shows the number of transactions that used this buffer
(and possibly a temporary file) for storing statements. The
[`Binlog_cache_disk_use`](server-status-variables.md#statvar_Binlog_cache_disk_use) status
variable shows how many of those transactions actually had to use
a temporary file. These two variables can be used for tuning
[`binlog_cache_size`](replication-options-binary-log.md#sysvar_binlog_cache_size) to a large
enough value that avoids the use of temporary files.

The [`max_binlog_cache_size`](replication-options-binary-log.md#sysvar_max_binlog_cache_size) system
variable (default 4GB, which is also the maximum) can be used to
restrict the total size used to cache a multiple-statement
transaction. If a transaction is larger than this many bytes, it
fails and rolls back. The minimum value is 4096.

If you are using the binary log and row based logging, concurrent
inserts are converted to normal inserts for `CREATE ...
SELECT` or
[`INSERT ...
SELECT`](insert-select.md "15.2.7.1 INSERT ... SELECT Statement") statements. This is done to ensure that you can
re-create an exact copy of your tables by applying the log during
a backup operation. If you are using statement-based logging, the
original statement is written to the log.

The binary log format has some known limitations that can affect
recovery from backups. See [Section 19.5.1, “Replication Features and Issues”](replication-features.md "19.5.1 Replication Features and Issues").

Binary logging for stored programs is done as described in
[Section 27.7, “Stored Program Binary Logging”](stored-programs-logging.md "27.7 Stored Program Binary Logging").

Note that the binary log format differs in MySQL 8.0
from previous versions of MySQL, due to enhancements in
replication. See [Section 19.5.2, “Replication Compatibility Between MySQL Versions”](replication-compatibility.md "19.5.2 Replication Compatibility Between MySQL Versions").

If the server is unable to write to the binary log, flush binary
log files, or synchronize the binary log to disk, the binary log
on the replication source server can become inconsistent and
replicas can lose synchronization with the source. The
[`binlog_error_action`](replication-options-binary-log.md#sysvar_binlog_error_action) system
variable controls the action taken if an error of this type is
encountered with the binary log.

- The default setting, `ABORT_SERVER`, makes
  the server halt binary logging and shut down. At this point,
  you can identify and correct the cause of the error. On
  restart, recovery proceeds as in the case of an unexpected
  server halt (see
  [Section 19.4.2, “Handling an Unexpected Halt of a Replica”](replication-solutions-unexpected-replica-halt.md "19.4.2 Handling an Unexpected Halt of a Replica")).
- The setting `IGNORE_ERROR` provides backward
  compatibility with older versions of MySQL. With this setting,
  the server continues the ongoing transaction and logs the
  error, then halts binary logging, but continues to perform
  updates. At this point, you can identify and correct the cause
  of the error. To resume binary logging,
  [`log_bin`](replication-options-binary-log.md#sysvar_log_bin) must be enabled
  again, which requires a server restart. Only use this option
  if you require backward compatibility, and the binary log is
  non-essential on this MySQL server instance. For example, you
  might use the binary log only for intermittent auditing or
  debugging of the server, and not use it for replication from
  the server or rely on it for point-in-time restore operations.

By default, the binary log is synchronized to disk at each write
([`sync_binlog=1`](replication-options-binary-log.md#sysvar_sync_binlog)). If
[`sync_binlog`](replication-options-binary-log.md#sysvar_sync_binlog) was not enabled, and
the operating system or machine (not only the MySQL server)
crashed, there is a chance that the last statements of the binary
log could be lost. To prevent this, enable the
[`sync_binlog`](replication-options-binary-log.md#sysvar_sync_binlog) system variable to
synchronize the binary log to disk after every
*`N`* commit groups. See
[Section 7.1.8, “Server System Variables”](server-system-variables.md "7.1.8 Server System Variables"). The safest value for
[`sync_binlog`](replication-options-binary-log.md#sysvar_sync_binlog) is 1 (the default),
but this is also the slowest.

In earlier MySQL releases, there was a chance of inconsistency
between the table content and binary log content if a crash
occurred, even with [`sync_binlog`](replication-options-binary-log.md#sysvar_sync_binlog)
set to 1. For example, if you are using `InnoDB`
tables and the MySQL server processes a
[`COMMIT`](commit.md "15.3.1 START TRANSACTION, COMMIT, and ROLLBACK Statements") statement, it writes many
prepared transactions to the binary log in sequence, synchronizes
the binary log, and then commits the transaction into
`InnoDB`. If the server unexpectedly exited
between those two operations, the transaction would be rolled back
by `InnoDB` at restart but still exist in the
binary log. Such an issue was resolved in previous releases by
enabling `InnoDB` support for two-phase commit in
XA transactions. In MySQL 8.0,
`InnoDB` support for two-phase commit in XA
transactions is always enabled.

`InnoDB` support for two-phase commit in XA
transactions ensures that the binary log and
`InnoDB` data files are synchronized. However,
the MySQL server should also be configured to synchronize the
binary log and the `InnoDB` logs to disk before
committing the transaction. The `InnoDB` logs are
synchronized by default, and `sync_binlog=1`
ensures the binary log is synchronized. The effect of implicit
`InnoDB` support for two-phase commit in XA
transactions and `sync_binlog=1` is that at
restart after a crash, after doing a rollback of transactions, the
MySQL server scans the latest binary log file to collect
transaction *`xid`* values and calculate
the last valid position in the binary log file. The MySQL server
then tells `InnoDB` to complete any prepared
transactions that were successfully written to the to the binary
log, and truncates the binary log to the last valid position. This
ensures that the binary log reflects the exact data of
`InnoDB` tables, and therefore the replica
remains in synchrony with the source because it does not receive a
statement which has been rolled back.

If the MySQL server discovers at crash recovery that the binary
log is shorter than it should have been, it lacks at least one
successfully committed `InnoDB` transaction. This
should not happen if `sync_binlog=1` and the
disk/file system do an actual sync when they are requested to
(some do not), so the server prints an error message `The
binary log file_name is shorter than
its expected size`. In this case, this binary log is not
correct and replication should be restarted from a fresh snapshot
of the source's data.

The session values of the following system variables are written
to the binary log and honored by the replica when parsing the
binary log:

- [`sql_mode`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_sql_mode) (except that the
  [`NO_DIR_IN_CREATE`](sql-mode.md#sqlmode_no_dir_in_create) mode is not
  replicated; see
  [Section 19.5.1.39, “Replication and Variables”](replication-features-variables.md "19.5.1.39 Replication and Variables"))
- [`foreign_key_checks`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_foreign_key_checks)
- [`unique_checks`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_unique_checks)
- [`character_set_client`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_character_set_client)
- [`collation_connection`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_collation_connection)
- [`collation_database`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_collation_database)
- [`collation_server`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_collation_server)
- [`sql_auto_is_null`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_sql_auto_is_null)
