#### 29.12.21.1 The component\_scheduler\_tasks Table

The `component_scheduler_tasks` table
contains a row for each scheduled task. Each row contains
information about the ongoing progress of a task that
applications, components, and plugins can implement,
optionally, using the `scheduler` component
(see [Section 7.5.5, “Scheduler Component”](scheduler-component.md "7.5.5 Scheduler Component")). For example, the
`audit_log` server plugin utilizes the
`scheduler` component to run a regular,
recurring flush of its memory cache:

```sql
mysql> select * from performance_schema.component_scheduler_tasks\G
*************************** 1. row ***************************
            NAME: plugin_audit_log_flush_scheduler
          STATUS: WAITING
         COMMENT: Registered by the audit log plugin. Does a periodic refresh of the audit log
                  in-memory rules cache by calling audit_log_flush
INTERVAL_SECONDS: 100
       TIMES_RUN: 5
    TIMES_FAILED: 0
1 row in set (0.02 sec)
```

The `component_scheduler_tasks` table has the
following columns:

- `NAME`

  The name supplied during the registration.
- `STATUS`

  The values are:

  - `RUNNING` if the task is active and
    being executed.
  - `WAITING` if the task is idle and
    waiting for the background thread to pick it up or
    waiting for the next time it needs to be run to
    arrive.
- `COMMENT`

  A compile-time comment provided by an application,
  component, or plugin. In the previous example, MySQL Enterprise Audit
  provides the comment using a server plugin named
  `audit_log`.
- `INTERVAL_SECONDS`

  The time in seconds to run a task, which an application,
  component, or plugin provides. MySQL Enterprise Audit enables you to
  specify this value using the
  [`audit_log_flush_interval_seconds`](audit-log-reference.md#sysvar_audit_log_flush_interval_seconds)
  system variable.
- `TIMES_RUN`

  A counter that increments by one every time the task runs
  successfully. It wraps around.
- `TIMES_FAILED`

  A counter that increments by one every time the execution
  of the task fails. It wraps around.
