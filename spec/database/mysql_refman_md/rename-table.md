### 15.1.36 RENAME TABLE Statement

```sql
RENAME TABLE
    tbl_name TO new_tbl_name
    [, tbl_name2 TO new_tbl_name2] ...
```

[`RENAME TABLE`](rename-table.md "15.1.36 RENAME TABLE Statement") renames one or more
tables. You must have [`ALTER`](privileges-provided.md#priv_alter) and
[`DROP`](privileges-provided.md#priv_drop) privileges for the original
table, and [`CREATE`](privileges-provided.md#priv_create) and
[`INSERT`](privileges-provided.md#priv_insert) privileges for the new
table.

For example, to rename a table named `old_table`
to `new_table`, use this statement:

```sql
RENAME TABLE old_table TO new_table;
```

That statement is equivalent to the following
[`ALTER TABLE`](alter-table.md "15.1.9 ALTER TABLE Statement") statement:

```sql
ALTER TABLE old_table RENAME new_table;
```

`RENAME TABLE`, unlike [`ALTER
TABLE`](alter-table.md "15.1.9 ALTER TABLE Statement"), can rename multiple tables within a single
statement:

```sql
RENAME TABLE old_table1 TO new_table1,
             old_table2 TO new_table2,
             old_table3 TO new_table3;
```

Renaming operations are performed left to right. Thus, to swap two
table names, do this (assuming that a table with the intermediary
name `tmp_table` does not already exist):

```sql
RENAME TABLE old_table TO tmp_table,
             new_table TO old_table,
             tmp_table TO new_table;
```

Metadata locks on tables are acquired in name order, which in some
cases can make a difference in operation outcome when multiple
transactions execute concurrently. See
[Section 10.11.4, “Metadata Locking”](metadata-locking.md "10.11.4 Metadata Locking").

As of MySQL 8.0.13, you can rename tables locked with a
[`LOCK TABLES`](lock-tables.md "15.3.6 LOCK TABLES and UNLOCK TABLES Statements") statement, provided
that they are locked with a `WRITE` lock or are
the product of renaming `WRITE`-locked tables
from earlier steps in a multiple-table rename operation. For
example, this is permitted:

```sql
LOCK TABLE old_table1 WRITE;
RENAME TABLE old_table1 TO new_table1,
             new_table1 TO new_table2;
```

This is not permitted:

```sql
LOCK TABLE old_table1 READ;
RENAME TABLE old_table1 TO new_table1,
             new_table1 TO new_table2;
```

Prior to MySQL 8.0.13, to execute `RENAME TABLE`,
there must be no tables locked with `LOCK
TABLES`.

With the transaction table locking conditions satisfied, the
rename operation is done atomically; no other session can access
any of the tables while the rename is in progress.

If any errors occur during a `RENAME TABLE`, the
statement fails and no changes are made.

You can use `RENAME TABLE` to move a table from
one database to another:

```sql
RENAME TABLE current_db.tbl_name TO other_db.tbl_name;
```

Using this method to move all tables from one database to a
different one in effect renames the database (an operation for
which MySQL has no single statement), except that the original
database continues to exist, albeit with no tables.

Like `RENAME TABLE`, `ALTER TABLE ...
RENAME` can also be used to move a table to a different
database. Regardless of the statement used, if the rename
operation would move the table to a database located on a
different file system, the success of the outcome is platform
specific and depends on the underlying operating system calls used
to move table files.

If a table has triggers, attempts to rename the table into a
different database fail with a Trigger in wrong
schema
([`ER_TRG_IN_WRONG_SCHEMA`](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/mysql-errors/8.0/en/server-error-reference.html#error_er_trg_in_wrong_schema)) error.

An unencrypted table can be moved to an encryption-enabled
database and vice versa. However, if the
[`table_encryption_privilege_check`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_table_encryption_privilege_check)
variable is enabled, the
[`TABLE_ENCRYPTION_ADMIN`](privileges-provided.md#priv_table-encryption-admin) privilege is
required if the table encryption setting differs from the default
database encryption.

To rename `TEMPORARY` tables, `RENAME
TABLE` does not work. Use [`ALTER
TABLE`](alter-table.md "15.1.9 ALTER TABLE Statement") instead.

`RENAME TABLE` works for views, except that views
cannot be renamed into a different database.

Any privileges granted specifically for a renamed table or view
are not migrated to the new name. They must be changed manually.

`RENAME TABLE tbl_name TO
new_tbl_name` changes
internally generated foreign key constraint names and user-defined
foreign key constraint names that begin with the string
“*`tbl_name`*\_ibfk\_” to
reflect the new table name. `InnoDB` interprets
foreign key constraint names that begin with the string
“*`tbl_name`*\_ibfk\_” as
internally generated names.

Foreign key constraint names that point to the renamed table are
automatically updated unless there is a conflict, in which case
the statement fails with an error. A conflict occurs if the
renamed constraint name already exists. In such cases, you must
drop and re-create the foreign keys for them to function properly.

`RENAME TABLE tbl_name TO
new_tbl_name` changes
internally generated and user-defined `CHECK`
constraint names that begin with the string
“*`tbl_name`*\_chk\_” to reflect
the new table name. MySQL interprets `CHECK`
constraint names that begin with the string
“*`tbl_name`*\_chk\_” as
internally generated names. Example:

```sql
mysql> SHOW CREATE TABLE t1\G
*************************** 1. row ***************************
       Table: t1
Create Table: CREATE TABLE `t1` (
  `i1` int(11) DEFAULT NULL,
  `i2` int(11) DEFAULT NULL,
  CONSTRAINT `t1_chk_1` CHECK ((`i1` > 0)),
  CONSTRAINT `t1_chk_2` CHECK ((`i2` < 0))
) ENGINE=InnoDB DEFAULT CHARSET=utf8mb4 COLLATE=utf8mb4_0900_ai_ci
1 row in set (0.02 sec)

mysql> RENAME TABLE t1 TO t3;
Query OK, 0 rows affected (0.03 sec)

mysql> SHOW CREATE TABLE t3\G
*************************** 1. row ***************************
       Table: t3
Create Table: CREATE TABLE `t3` (
  `i1` int(11) DEFAULT NULL,
  `i2` int(11) DEFAULT NULL,
  CONSTRAINT `t3_chk_1` CHECK ((`i1` > 0)),
  CONSTRAINT `t3_chk_2` CHECK ((`i2` < 0))
) ENGINE=InnoDB DEFAULT CHARSET=utf8mb4 COLLATE=utf8mb4_0900_ai_ci
1 row in set (0.01 sec)
```
