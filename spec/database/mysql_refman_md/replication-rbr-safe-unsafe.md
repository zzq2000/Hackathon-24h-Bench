#### 19.2.1.3 Determination of Safe and Unsafe Statements in Binary Logging

The “safeness” of a statement in MySQL replication
refers to whether the statement and its effects can be
replicated correctly using statement-based format. If this is
true of the statement, we refer to the statement as
safe; otherwise, we refer
to it as unsafe.

In general, a statement is safe if it deterministic, and unsafe
if it is not. However, certain nondeterministic functions are
*not* considered unsafe (see
[Nondeterministic functions not considered unsafe](replication-rbr-safe-unsafe.md#replication-rbr-safe-unsafe-not "Nondeterministic functions not considered unsafe"), later in this
section). In addition, statements using results from
floating-point math functions—which are
hardware-dependent—are always considered unsafe (see
[Section 19.5.1.12, “Replication and Floating-Point Values”](replication-features-floatvalues.md "19.5.1.12 Replication and Floating-Point Values")).

**Handling of safe and unsafe statements.**
A statement is treated differently depending on whether the
statement is considered safe, and with respect to the binary
logging format (that is, the current value of
[`binlog_format`](replication-options-binary-log.md#sysvar_binlog_format)).

- When using row-based logging, no distinction is made in the
  treatment of safe and unsafe statements.
- When using mixed-format logging, statements flagged as
  unsafe are logged using the row-based format; statements
  regarded as safe are logged using the statement-based
  format.
- When using statement-based logging, statements flagged as
  being unsafe generate a warning to this effect. Safe
  statements are logged normally.

Each statement flagged as unsafe generates a warning. If a large
number of such statements were executed on the source, this
could lead to excessively large error log files. To prevent
this, MySQL has a warning suppression mechanism. Whenever the 50
most recent
[`ER_BINLOG_UNSAFE_STATEMENT`](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/mysql-errors/8.0/en/server-error-reference.html#error_er_binlog_unsafe_statement)
warnings have been generated more than 50 times in any 50-second
period, warning suppression is enabled. When activated, this
causes such warnings not to be written to the error log;
instead, for each 50 warnings of this type, a note `The
last warning was repeated N times in
last S seconds` is written
to the error log. This continues as long as the 50 most recent
such warnings were issued in 50 seconds or less; once the rate
has decreased below this threshold, the warnings are once again
logged normally. Warning suppression has no effect on how the
safety of statements for statement-based logging is determined,
nor on how warnings are sent to the client. MySQL clients still
receive one warning for each such statement.

For more information, see [Section 19.2.1, “Replication Formats”](replication-formats.md "19.2.1 Replication Formats").

**Statements considered unsafe.**
Statements with the following characteristics are considered
unsafe:

- **Statements containing system functions that may return a different value
  on the replica.**
  These functions include
  [`FOUND_ROWS()`](information-functions.md#function_found-rows),
  [`GET_LOCK()`](locking-functions.md#function_get-lock),
  [`IS_FREE_LOCK()`](locking-functions.md#function_is-free-lock),
  [`IS_USED_LOCK()`](locking-functions.md#function_is-used-lock),
  [`LOAD_FILE()`](string-functions.md#function_load-file),
  [`MASTER_POS_WAIT()`](replication-functions-synchronization.md#function_master-pos-wait),
  [`RAND()`](mathematical-functions.md#function_rand),
  [`RELEASE_LOCK()`](locking-functions.md#function_release-lock),
  [`ROW_COUNT()`](information-functions.md#function_row-count),
  [`SESSION_USER()`](information-functions.md#function_session-user),
  [`SLEEP()`](miscellaneous-functions.md#function_sleep),
  [`SOURCE_POS_WAIT()`](replication-functions-synchronization.md#function_source-pos-wait),
  [`SYSDATE()`](date-and-time-functions.md#function_sysdate),
  [`SYSTEM_USER()`](information-functions.md#function_system-user),
  [`USER()`](information-functions.md#function_user),
  [`UUID()`](miscellaneous-functions.md#function_uuid), and
  [`UUID_SHORT()`](miscellaneous-functions.md#function_uuid-short).

  **Nondeterministic functions not considered unsafe.**
  Although these functions are not deterministic, they are
  treated as safe for purposes of logging and replication:
  [`CONNECTION_ID()`](information-functions.md#function_connection-id),
  [`CURDATE()`](date-and-time-functions.md#function_curdate),
  [`CURRENT_DATE()`](date-and-time-functions.md#function_current-date),
  [`CURRENT_TIME()`](date-and-time-functions.md#function_current-time),
  [`CURRENT_TIMESTAMP()`](date-and-time-functions.md#function_current-timestamp),
  [`CURTIME()`](date-and-time-functions.md#function_curtime),
  [`LAST_INSERT_ID()`](information-functions.md#function_last-insert-id),
  [`LOCALTIME()`](date-and-time-functions.md#function_localtime),
  [`LOCALTIMESTAMP()`](date-and-time-functions.md#function_localtimestamp),
  [`NOW()`](date-and-time-functions.md#function_now),
  [`UNIX_TIMESTAMP()`](date-and-time-functions.md#function_unix-timestamp),
  [`UTC_DATE()`](date-and-time-functions.md#function_utc-date),
  [`UTC_TIME()`](date-and-time-functions.md#function_utc-time), and
  [`UTC_TIMESTAMP()`](date-and-time-functions.md#function_utc-timestamp).

  For more information, see
  [Section 19.5.1.14, “Replication and System Functions”](replication-features-functions.md "19.5.1.14 Replication and System Functions").
- **References to system variables.**
  Most system variables are not replicated correctly using
  the statement-based format. See
  [Section 19.5.1.39, “Replication and Variables”](replication-features-variables.md "19.5.1.39 Replication and Variables"). For
  exceptions, see [Section 7.4.4.3, “Mixed Binary Logging Format”](binary-log-mixed.md "7.4.4.3 Mixed Binary Logging Format").
- **Loadable Functions.**
  Since we have no control over what a loadable function
  does, we must assume that it is executing unsafe
  statements.
- **Fulltext plugin.**
  This plugin may behave differently on different MySQL
  servers; therefore, statements depending on it could have
  different results. For this reason, all statements relying
  on the fulltext plugin are treated as unsafe in MySQL.
- **Trigger or stored program updates a table having an AUTO\_INCREMENT
  column.**
  This is unsafe because the order in which the rows are
  updated may differ on the source and the replica.

  In addition, an [`INSERT`](insert.md "15.2.7 INSERT Statement") into a
  table that has a composite primary key containing an
  `AUTO_INCREMENT` column that is not the
  first column of this composite key is unsafe.

  For more information, see
  [Section 19.5.1.1, “Replication and AUTO\_INCREMENT”](replication-features-auto-increment.md "19.5.1.1 Replication and AUTO_INCREMENT").
- **INSERT ... ON DUPLICATE KEY UPDATE statements on tables with multiple
  primary or unique keys.**
  When executed against a table that contains more than one
  primary or unique key, this statement is considered
  unsafe, being sensitive to the order in which the storage
  engine checks the keys, which is not deterministic, and on
  which the choice of rows updated by the MySQL Server
  depends.

  An
  [`INSERT
  ... ON DUPLICATE KEY UPDATE`](insert-on-duplicate.md "15.2.7.2 INSERT ... ON DUPLICATE KEY UPDATE Statement") statement against a
  table having more than one unique or primary key is marked
  as unsafe for statement-based replication. (Bug #11765650,
  Bug #58637)
- **Updates using LIMIT.**
  The order in which rows are retrieved is not specified,
  and is therefore considered unsafe. See
  [Section 19.5.1.18, “Replication and LIMIT”](replication-features-limit.md "19.5.1.18 Replication and LIMIT").
- **Accesses or references log tables.**
  The contents of the system log table may differ between
  source and replica.
- **Nontransactional operations after transactional operations.**
  Within a transaction, allowing any nontransactional reads
  or writes to execute after any transactional reads or
  writes is considered unsafe.

  For more information, see
  [Section 19.5.1.35, “Replication and Transactions”](replication-features-transactions.md "19.5.1.35 Replication and Transactions").
- **Accesses or references self-logging tables.**
  All reads and writes to self-logging tables are considered
  unsafe. Within a transaction, any statement following a
  read or write to self-logging tables is also considered
  unsafe.
- **LOAD DATA statements.**
  [`LOAD DATA`](load-data.md "15.2.9 LOAD DATA Statement") is treated as
  unsafe and when
  [`binlog_format=MIXED`](replication-options-binary-log.md#sysvar_binlog_format) the
  statement is logged in row-based format. When
  [`binlog_format=STATEMENT`](replication-options-binary-log.md#sysvar_binlog_format)
  [`LOAD DATA`](load-data.md "15.2.9 LOAD DATA Statement") does not generate
  a warning, unlike other unsafe statements.
- **XA transactions.**
  If two XA transactions committed in parallel on the source
  are being prepared on the replica in the inverse order,
  locking dependencies can occur with statement-based
  replication that cannot be safely resolved, and it is
  possible for replication to fail with deadlock on the
  replica. When
  [`binlog_format=STATEMENT`](replication-options-binary-log.md#sysvar_binlog_format)
  is set, DML statements inside XA transactions are flagged
  as being unsafe and generate a warning. When
  [`binlog_format=MIXED`](replication-options-binary-log.md#sysvar_binlog_format) or
  [`binlog_format=ROW`](replication-options-binary-log.md#sysvar_binlog_format) is set,
  DML statements inside XA transactions are logged using
  row-based replication, and the potential issue is not
  present.
- **`DEFAULT` clause that refers to a nondeterministic
  function.**
  If an expression default value refers to a
  nondeterministic function, any statement that causes the
  expression to be evaluated is unsafe for statement-based
  replication. This includes statements such as
  [`INSERT`](insert.md "15.2.7 INSERT Statement"),
  [`UPDATE`](update.md "15.2.17 UPDATE Statement"), and
  [`ALTER TABLE`](alter-table.md "15.1.9 ALTER TABLE Statement"). Unlike most
  other unsafe statements, this category of statement cannot
  be replicated safely in row-based format. When
  [`binlog_format`](replication-options-binary-log.md#sysvar_binlog_format) is set to
  `STATEMENT`, the statement is logged and
  executed but a warning message is written to the error
  log. When [`binlog_format`](replication-options-binary-log.md#sysvar_binlog_format)
  is set to `MIXED` or
  `ROW`, the statement is not executed and
  an error message is written to the error log. For more
  information on the handling of explicit defaults, see
  [Explicit Default Handling as of MySQL 8.0.13](data-type-defaults.md#data-type-defaults-explicit "Explicit Default Handling as of MySQL 8.0.13").
