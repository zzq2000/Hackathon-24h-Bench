### 10.6.1 Optimizing MyISAM Queries

Some general tips for speeding up queries on
`MyISAM` tables:

- To help MySQL better optimize queries, use
  [`ANALYZE TABLE`](analyze-table.md "15.7.3.1 ANALYZE TABLE Statement") or run
  [**myisamchk --analyze**](myisamchk.md "6.6.4 myisamchk — MyISAM Table-Maintenance Utility") on a table after it
  has been loaded with data. This updates a value for each
  index part that indicates the average number of rows that
  have the same value. (For unique indexes, this is always 1.)
  MySQL uses this to decide which index to choose when you
  join two tables based on a nonconstant expression. You can
  check the result from the table analysis by using
  `SHOW INDEX FROM
  tbl_name` and examining
  the `Cardinality` value. [**myisamchk
  --description --verbose**](myisamchk.md "6.6.4 myisamchk — MyISAM Table-Maintenance Utility") shows index distribution
  information.
- To sort an index and data according to an index, use
  [**myisamchk --sort-index --sort-records=1**](myisamchk.md "6.6.4 myisamchk — MyISAM Table-Maintenance Utility")
  (assuming that you want to sort on index 1). This is a good
  way to make queries faster if you have a unique index from
  which you want to read all rows in order according to the
  index. The first time you sort a large table this way, it
  may take a long time.
- Try to avoid complex [`SELECT`](select.md "15.2.13 SELECT Statement")
  queries on `MyISAM` tables that are updated
  frequently, to avoid problems with table locking that occur
  due to contention between readers and writers.
- `MyISAM` supports concurrent inserts: If a
  table has no free blocks in the middle of the data file, you
  can [`INSERT`](insert.md "15.2.7 INSERT Statement") new rows into it
  at the same time that other threads are reading from the
  table. If it is important to be able to do this, consider
  using the table in ways that avoid deleting rows. Another
  possibility is to run [`OPTIMIZE
  TABLE`](optimize-table.md "15.7.3.4 OPTIMIZE TABLE Statement") to defragment the table after you have
  deleted a lot of rows from it. This behavior is altered by
  setting the
  [`concurrent_insert`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_concurrent_insert) variable.
  You can force new rows to be appended (and therefore permit
  concurrent inserts), even in tables that have deleted rows.
  See [Section 10.11.3, “Concurrent Inserts”](concurrent-inserts.md "10.11.3 Concurrent Inserts").
- For `MyISAM` tables that change frequently,
  try to avoid all variable-length columns
  ([`VARCHAR`](char.md "13.3.2 The CHAR and VARCHAR Types"),
  [`BLOB`](blob.md "13.3.4 The BLOB and TEXT Types"), and
  [`TEXT`](blob.md "13.3.4 The BLOB and TEXT Types")). The table uses dynamic
  row format if it includes even a single variable-length
  column. See [Chapter 18, *Alternative Storage Engines*](storage-engines.md "Chapter 18 Alternative Storage Engines").
- It is normally not useful to split a table into different
  tables just because the rows become large. In accessing a
  row, the biggest performance hit is the disk seek needed to
  find the first byte of the row. After finding the data, most
  modern disks can read the entire row fast enough for most
  applications. The only cases where splitting up a table
  makes an appreciable difference is if it is a
  `MyISAM` table using dynamic row format
  that you can change to a fixed row size, or if you very
  often need to scan the table but do not need most of the
  columns. See [Chapter 18, *Alternative Storage Engines*](storage-engines.md "Chapter 18 Alternative Storage Engines").
- Use `ALTER TABLE ... ORDER BY
  expr1,
  expr2, ...` if you
  usually retrieve rows in
  `expr1,
  expr2, ...` order. By
  using this option after extensive changes to the table, you
  may be able to get higher performance.
- If you often need to calculate results such as counts based
  on information from a lot of rows, it may be preferable to
  introduce a new table and update the counter in real time.
  An update of the following form is very fast:

  ```sql
  UPDATE tbl_name SET count_col=count_col+1 WHERE key_col=constant;
  ```

  This is very important when you use MySQL storage engines
  such as `MyISAM` that has only table-level
  locking (multiple readers with single writers). This also
  gives better performance with most database systems, because
  the row locking manager in this case has less to do.
- Use [`OPTIMIZE TABLE`](optimize-table.md "15.7.3.4 OPTIMIZE TABLE Statement")
  periodically to avoid fragmentation with dynamic-format
  `MyISAM` tables. See
  [Section 18.2.3, “MyISAM Table Storage Formats”](myisam-table-formats.md "18.2.3 MyISAM Table Storage Formats").
- Declaring a `MyISAM` table with the
  `DELAY_KEY_WRITE=1` table option makes
  index updates faster because they are not flushed to disk
  until the table is closed. The downside is that if something
  kills the server while such a table is open, you must ensure
  that the table is okay by running the server with the
  [`myisam_recover_options`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_myisam_recover_options)
  system variable set, or by running
  [**myisamchk**](myisamchk.md "6.6.4 myisamchk — MyISAM Table-Maintenance Utility") before restarting the server.
  (However, even in this case, you should not lose anything by
  using `DELAY_KEY_WRITE`, because the key
  information can always be generated from the data rows.)
- Strings are automatically prefix- and end-space compressed
  in `MyISAM` indexes. See
  [Section 15.1.15, “CREATE INDEX Statement”](create-index.md "15.1.15 CREATE INDEX Statement").
- You can increase performance by caching queries or answers
  in your application and then executing many inserts or
  updates together. Locking the table during this operation
  ensures that the index cache is only flushed once after all
  updates.
