## 28.5 INFORMATION\_SCHEMA Thread Pool Tables

[28.5.1 INFORMATION\_SCHEMA Thread Pool Table Reference](information-schema-thread-pool-table-reference.md)

[28.5.2 The INFORMATION\_SCHEMA TP\_THREAD\_GROUP\_STATE Table](information-schema-tp-thread-group-state-table.md)

[28.5.3 The INFORMATION\_SCHEMA TP\_THREAD\_GROUP\_STATS Table](information-schema-tp-thread-group-stats-table.md)

[28.5.4 The INFORMATION\_SCHEMA TP\_THREAD\_STATE Table](information-schema-tp-thread-state-table.md)

Note

As of MySQL 8.0.14, the `INFORMATION_SCHEMA`
thread pool tables are also available as Performance Schema
tables. (See
[Section 29.12.16, “Performance Schema Thread Pool Tables”](performance-schema-thread-pool-tables.md "29.12.16 Performance Schema Thread Pool Tables").) The
`INFORMATION_SCHEMA` tables are deprecated;
expect them be removed in a future version of MySQL. Applications
should transition away from the old tables to the new tables. For
example, if an application uses this query:

```sql
SELECT * FROM INFORMATION_SCHEMA.TP_THREAD_STATE;
```

The application should use this query instead:

```sql
SELECT * FROM performance_schema.tp_thread_state;
```

The following sections describe the
`INFORMATION_SCHEMA` tables associated with the
thread pool plugin (see [Section 7.6.3, “MySQL Enterprise Thread Pool”](thread-pool.md "7.6.3 MySQL Enterprise Thread Pool")). They provide
information about thread pool operation:

- [`TP_THREAD_GROUP_STATE`](information-schema-tp-thread-group-state-table.md "28.5.2 The INFORMATION_SCHEMA TP_THREAD_GROUP_STATE Table"): Information
  about thread pool thread group states
- [`TP_THREAD_GROUP_STATS`](information-schema-tp-thread-group-stats-table.md "28.5.3 The INFORMATION_SCHEMA TP_THREAD_GROUP_STATS Table"): Thread group
  statistics
- [`TP_THREAD_STATE`](information-schema-tp-thread-state-table.md "28.5.4 The INFORMATION_SCHEMA TP_THREAD_STATE Table"): Information about
  thread pool thread states

Rows in these tables represent snapshots in time. In the case of
`TP_THREAD_STATE`, all rows for a thread group
comprise a snapshot in time. Thus, the MySQL server holds the mutex
of the thread group while producing the snapshot. But it does not
hold mutexes on all thread groups at the same time, to prevent a
statement against `TP_THREAD_STATE` from blocking
the entire MySQL server.

The `INFORMATION_SCHEMA` thread pool tables are
implemented by individual plugins and the decision whether to load
one can be made independently of the others (see
[Section 7.6.3.2, “Thread Pool Installation”](thread-pool-installation.md "7.6.3.2 Thread Pool Installation")). However, the content of
all the tables depends on the thread pool plugin being enabled. If a
table plugin is enabled but the thread pool plugin is not, the table
becomes visible and can be accessed but is empty.
