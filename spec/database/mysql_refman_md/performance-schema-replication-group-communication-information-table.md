#### 29.12.11.12 The replication\_group\_communication\_information Table

This table shows group configuration options for the whole
replication group. The table is available only when Group
Replication is installed.

The
`replication_group_communication_information`
table has these columns:

- `WRITE_CONCURRENCY`

  The maximum number of consensus instances that the group
  can execute in parallel. The default value is 10. See
  [Section 20.5.1.3, “Using Group Replication Group Write Consensus”](group-replication-group-write-consensus.md "20.5.1.3 Using Group Replication Group Write Consensus").
- `PROTOCOL_VERSION`

  The Group Replication communication protocol version,
  which determines what messaging capabilities are used.
  This is set to accommodate the oldest MySQL Server version
  that you want the group to support. See
  [Section 20.5.1.4, “Setting a Group's Communication Protocol Version”](group-replication-communication-protocol.md "20.5.1.4 Setting a Group's Communication Protocol Version").
- `WRITE_CONSENSUS_LEADERS_PREFERRED`

  The leader or leaders that Group Replication has
  instructed the group communication engine to use to drive
  consensus. For a group in single-primary mode with the
  [`group_replication_paxos_single_leader`](group-replication-system-variables.md#sysvar_group_replication_paxos_single_leader)
  system variable set to `ON` and the
  communication protocol version set to 8.0.27 or above, the
  single consensus leader is the group's primary.
  Otherwise, all group members are used as leaders, so they
  are all shown here. See
  [Section 20.7.3, “Single Consensus Leader”](group-replication-single-consensus-leader.md "20.7.3 Single Consensus Leader").
- `WRITE_CONSENSUS_LEADERS_ACTUAL`

  The actual leader or leader that the group communication
  engine is using to drive consensus. If a single consensus
  leader is in use for the group, and the primary is
  currently unhealthy, the group communication selects an
  alternative consensus leader. In this situation, the group
  member specified here can differ from the preferred group
  member.
- `WRITE_CONSENSUS_SINGLE_LEADER_CAPABLE`

  Whether the replication group is capable of using a single
  consensus leader. 1 means that the group was started with
  the use of a single leader enabled
  ([`group_replication_paxos_single_leader
  = ON`](group-replication-system-variables.md#sysvar_group_replication_paxos_single_leader)), and this is still shown if the value of
  [`group_replication_paxos_single_leader`](group-replication-system-variables.md#sysvar_group_replication_paxos_single_leader)
  has since been changed on this group member. 0 means that
  the group was started with single leader mode disabled
  ([`group_replication_paxos_single_leader
  = OFF`](group-replication-system-variables.md#sysvar_group_replication_paxos_single_leader)), or has a Group Replication communication
  protocol version that does not support the use of a single
  consensus leader (below 8.0.27). This information is only
  returned for group members in `ONLINE` or
  `RECOVERING` state.

The
`replication_group_communication_information`
table has no indexes.

[`TRUNCATE TABLE`](truncate-table.md "15.1.37 TRUNCATE TABLE Statement") is not permitted
for the
`replication_group_communication_information`
table.
