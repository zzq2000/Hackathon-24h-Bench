#### 15.7.2.1 ALTER RESOURCE GROUP Statement

```sql
ALTER RESOURCE GROUP group_name
    [VCPU [=] vcpu_spec [, vcpu_spec] ...]
    [THREAD_PRIORITY [=] N]
    [ENABLE|DISABLE [FORCE]]

vcpu_spec: {N | M - N}
```

[`ALTER RESOURCE GROUP`](alter-resource-group.md "15.7.2.1 ALTER RESOURCE GROUP Statement") is used for
resource group management (see
[Section 7.1.16, “Resource Groups”](resource-groups.md "7.1.16 Resource Groups")). This statement alters
modifiable attributes of an existing resource group. It requires
the [`RESOURCE_GROUP_ADMIN`](privileges-provided.md#priv_resource-group-admin)
privilege.

*`group_name`* identifies which resource
group to alter. If the group does not exist, an error occurs.

The attributes for CPU affinity, priority, and whether the group
is enabled can be modified with [`ALTER
RESOURCE GROUP`](alter-resource-group.md "15.7.2.1 ALTER RESOURCE GROUP Statement"). These attributes are specified the
same way as described for [`CREATE RESOURCE
GROUP`](create-resource-group.md "15.7.2.2 CREATE RESOURCE GROUP Statement") (see [Section 15.7.2.2, “CREATE RESOURCE GROUP Statement”](create-resource-group.md "15.7.2.2 CREATE RESOURCE GROUP Statement")).
Only the attributes specified are altered. Unspecified
attributes retain their current values.

The `FORCE` modifier is used with
`DISABLE`. It determines statement behavior if
the resource group has any threads assigned to it:

- If `FORCE` is not given, existing threads
  in the group continue to run until they terminate, but new
  threads cannot be assigned to the group.
- If `FORCE` is given, existing threads in
  the group are moved to their respective default group
  (system threads to `SYS_default`, user
  threads to `USR_default`).

The name and type attributes are set at group creation time and
cannot be modified thereafter with [`ALTER
RESOURCE GROUP`](alter-resource-group.md "15.7.2.1 ALTER RESOURCE GROUP Statement").

Examples:

- Alter a group CPU affinity:

  ```sql
  ALTER RESOURCE GROUP rg1 VCPU = 0-63;
  ```
- Alter a group thread priority:

  ```sql
  ALTER RESOURCE GROUP rg2 THREAD_PRIORITY = 5;
  ```
- Disable a group, moving any threads assigned to it to the
  default groups:

  ```sql
  ALTER RESOURCE GROUP rg3 DISABLE FORCE;
  ```

Resource group management is local to the server on which it
occurs. [`ALTER RESOURCE GROUP`](alter-resource-group.md "15.7.2.1 ALTER RESOURCE GROUP Statement")
statements are not written to the binary log and are not
replicated.
