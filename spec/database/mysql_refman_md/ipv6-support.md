Support for IPv6 in MySQL includes these capabilities:

- MySQL Server can accept TCP/IP connections from clients
  connecting over IPv6. For example, this command connects over
  IPv6 to the MySQL server on the local host:

  ```terminal
  $> mysql -h ::1
  ```

  To use this capability, two things must be true:

  - Your system must be configured to support IPv6. See
    [Section 7.1.13.1, “Verifying System Support for IPv6”](ipv6-system-support.md "7.1.13.1 Verifying System Support for IPv6").
  - The default MySQL server configuration permits IPv6
    connections in addition to IPv4 connections. To change the
    default configuration, start the server with the
    [`bind_address`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_bind_address) system
    variable set to an appropriate value. See
    [Section 7.1.8, “Server System Variables”](server-system-variables.md "7.1.8 Server System Variables").
- MySQL account names permit IPv6 addresses to enable DBAs to
  specify privileges for clients that connect to the server over
  IPv6. See [Section 8.2.4, “Specifying Account Names”](account-names.md "8.2.4 Specifying Account Names"). IPv6 addresses can
  be specified in account names in statements such as
  [`CREATE USER`](create-user.md "15.7.1.3 CREATE USER Statement"),
  [`GRANT`](grant.md "15.7.1.6 GRANT Statement"), and
  [`REVOKE`](revoke.md "15.7.1.8 REVOKE Statement"). For example:

  ```sql
  mysql> CREATE USER 'bill'@'::1' IDENTIFIED BY 'secret';
  mysql> GRANT SELECT ON mydb.* TO 'bill'@'::1';
  ```
- IPv6 functions enable conversion between string and internal
  format IPv6 address formats, and checking whether values
  represent valid IPv6 addresses. For example,
  [`INET6_ATON()`](miscellaneous-functions.md#function_inet6-aton) and
  [`INET6_NTOA()`](miscellaneous-functions.md#function_inet6-ntoa) are similar to
  [`INET_ATON()`](miscellaneous-functions.md#function_inet-aton) and
  [`INET_NTOA()`](miscellaneous-functions.md#function_inet-ntoa), but handle IPv6
  addresses in addition to IPv4 addresses. See
  [Section 14.23, “Miscellaneous Functions”](miscellaneous-functions.md "14.23 Miscellaneous Functions").
- From MySQL 8.0.14, Group Replication group members can use
  IPv6 addresses for communications within the group. A group
  can contain a mix of members using IPv6 and members using
  IPv4. See [Section 20.5.5, “Support For IPv6 And For Mixed IPv6 And IPv4 Groups”](group-replication-ipv6.md "20.5.5 Support For IPv6 And For Mixed IPv6 And IPv4 Groups").

The following sections describe how to set up MySQL so that
clients can connect to the server over IPv6.
