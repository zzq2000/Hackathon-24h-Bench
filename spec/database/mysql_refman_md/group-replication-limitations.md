### 20.3.2 Group Replication Limitations

- [Limit on Group Size](group-replication-limitations.md#group-replication-limitations-group-size "Limit on Group Size")
- [Limits on Transaction Size](group-replication-limitations.md#group-replication-limitations-transaction-size "Limits on Transaction Size")

The following known limitations exist for Group Replication. Note
that the limitations and issues described for multi-primary mode
groups can also apply in single-primary mode clusters during a
failover event, while the newly elected primary flushes out its
applier queue from the old primary.

Tip

Group Replication is built on GTID based replication, therefore
you should also be aware of
[Section 19.1.3.7, “Restrictions on Replication with GTIDs”](replication-gtids-restrictions.md "19.1.3.7 Restrictions on Replication with GTIDs").

- **`--upgrade=MINIMAL` option.**
  Group Replication cannot be started following a MySQL Server
  upgrade that uses the MINIMAL option
  (`--upgrade=MINIMAL`), which does not
  upgrade system tables on which the replication internals
  depend.
- **Gap Locks.**
  Group Replication's certification process for concurrent
  transactions does not take into account
  [gap locks](glossary.md#glos_gap_lock "gap lock"), as
  information about gap locks is not available outside of
  [`InnoDB`](innodb-storage-engine.md "Chapter 17 The InnoDB Storage Engine"). See
  [Gap Locks](innodb-locking.md#innodb-gap-locks "Gap Locks") for more information.

  Note

  For a group in multi-primary mode, unless you rely on
  [`REPEATABLE READ`](innodb-transaction-isolation-levels.md#isolevel_repeatable-read) semantics
  in your applications, we recommend using the
  [`READ COMMITTED`](innodb-transaction-isolation-levels.md#isolevel_read-committed) isolation
  level with Group Replication. InnoDB does not use gap locks
  in [`READ COMMITTED`](innodb-transaction-isolation-levels.md#isolevel_read-committed), which
  aligns the local conflict detection within InnoDB with the
  distributed conflict detection performed by Group
  Replication. For a group in single-primary mode, only the
  primary accepts writes, so the [`READ
  COMMITTED`](innodb-transaction-isolation-levels.md#isolevel_read-committed) isolation level is not important to
  Group Replication.
- **Table Locks and Named Locks.**
  The certification process does not take into account table
  locks (see [Section 15.3.6, “LOCK TABLES and UNLOCK TABLES Statements”](lock-tables.md "15.3.6 LOCK TABLES and UNLOCK TABLES Statements")) or named locks
  (see [`GET_LOCK()`](locking-functions.md#function_get-lock)).
- **Binary Log Checksums.**
  Up to and including MySQL 8.0.20, Group Replication cannot
  make use of checksums and does not support their presence in
  the binary log, so you must set
  [`binlog_checksum=NONE`](replication-options-binary-log.md#sysvar_binlog_checksum) when
  configuring a server instance to become a group member. From
  MySQL 8.0.21, Group Replication supports checksums, so group
  members may use the default setting
  [`binlog_checksum=CRC32`](replication-options-binary-log.md#sysvar_binlog_checksum). The
  setting for [`binlog_checksum`](replication-options-binary-log.md#sysvar_binlog_checksum)
  does not have to be the same for all members of a group.

  When checksums are available, Group Replication does not use
  them to verify incoming events on the
  `group_replication_applier` channel, because
  events are written to that relay log from multiple sources and
  before they are actually written to the originating server's
  binary log, which is when a checksum is generated. Checksums
  are used to verify the integrity of events on the
  `group_replication_recovery` channel and on
  any other replication channels on group members.
- **SERIALIZABLE Isolation Level.**
  [`SERIALIZABLE`](innodb-transaction-isolation-levels.md#isolevel_serializable) isolation
  level is not supported in multi-primary groups by default.
  Setting a transaction isolation level to
  `SERIALIZABLE` configures Group Replication
  to refuse to commit the transaction.
- **Concurrent DDL versus DML Operations.**
  Concurrent data definition statements and data manipulation
  statements executing against the same object but on
  different servers is not supported when using multi-primary
  mode. During execution of Data Definition Language (DDL)
  statements on an object, executing concurrent Data
  Manipulation Language (DML) on the same object but on a
  different server instance has the risk of conflicting DDL
  executing on different instances not being detected.
- **Foreign Keys with Cascading Constraints.**
  Multi-primary mode groups (members all configured with
  [`group_replication_single_primary_mode=OFF`](group-replication-system-variables.md#sysvar_group_replication_single_primary_mode))
  do not support tables with multi-level foreign key
  dependencies, specifically tables that have defined
  `CASCADING`
   [foreign key
  constraints](glossary.md#glos_foreign_key_constraint "FOREIGN KEY constraint"). This is because foreign key constraints
  that result in cascading operations executed by a
  multi-primary mode group can result in undetected conflicts
  and lead to inconsistent data across the members of the
  group. Therefore we recommend setting
  [`group_replication_enforce_update_everywhere_checks=ON`](group-replication-system-variables.md#sysvar_group_replication_enforce_update_everywhere_checks)
  on server instances used in multi-primary mode groups to
  avoid undetected conflicts.

  In single-primary mode this is not a problem as it does not
  allow concurrent writes to multiple members of the group and
  thus there is no risk of undetected conflicts.
- **Multi-primary Mode Deadlock.**
  When a group is operating in multi-primary mode,
  `SELECT .. FOR UPDATE` statements can
  result in a deadlock. This is because the lock is not shared
  across the members of the group, therefore the expectation
  for such a statement might not be reached.
- **Replication Filters.**
  Global replication filters cannot be used on a MySQL server
  instance that is configured for Group Replication, because
  filtering transactions on some servers would make the group
  unable to reach agreement on a consistent state. Channel
  specific replication filters can be used on replication
  channels that are not directly involved with Group
  Replication, such as where a group member also acts as a
  replica to a source that is outside the group. They cannot
  be used on the `group_replication_applier`
  or `group_replication_recovery` channels.
- **Encrypted Connections.**
  Support for the TLSv1.3 protocol is available in MySQL
  Server as of MySQL 8.0.16, provided that MySQL was compiled
  using OpenSSL 1.1.1 or higher. In MySQL 8.0.16 and MySQL
  8.0.17, if the server supports TLSv1.3, the protocol is not
  supported in the group communication engine and cannot be
  used by Group Replication. Group Replication supports
  TLSv1.3 from MySQL 8.0.18, where it can be used for group
  communication connections and distributed recovery
  connections.

  In MySQL 8.0.18, TLSv1.3 can be used in Group Replication for
  the distributed recovery connection, but the
  [`group_replication_recovery_tls_version`](group-replication-system-variables.md#sysvar_group_replication_recovery_tls_version)
  and
  [`group_replication_recovery_tls_ciphersuites`](group-replication-system-variables.md#sysvar_group_replication_recovery_tls_ciphersuites)
  system variables are not available. The donor servers must
  therefore permit the use of at least one TLSv1.3 ciphersuite
  that is enabled by default, as listed in
  [Section 8.3.2, “Encrypted Connection TLS Protocols and Ciphers”](encrypted-connection-protocols-ciphers.md "8.3.2 Encrypted Connection TLS Protocols and Ciphers"). From
  MySQL 8.0.19, you can use the options to configure client
  support for any selection of ciphersuites, including only
  non-default ciphersuites if you want.
- **Cloning Operations.**
  Group Replication initiates and manages cloning operations
  for distributed recovery, but group members that have been
  set up to support cloning may also participate in cloning
  operations that a user initiates manually. In releases
  before MySQL 8.0.20, you cannot initiate a cloning operation
  manually if the operation involves a group member on which
  Group Replication is running. From MySQL 8.0.20, you can do
  this, provided that the cloning operation does not remove
  and replace the data on the recipient. The statement to
  initiate the cloning operation must therefore include the
  `DATA DIRECTORY` clause if Group
  Replication is running. See
  [Section 20.5.4.2.4, “Cloning for Other Purposes”](group-replication-cloning.md#group-replication-cloning-manual "20.5.4.2.4 Cloning for Other Purposes").

#### Limit on Group Size

The maximum number of MySQL servers that can be members of a
single replication group is 9. If further members attempt to
join the group, their request is refused. This limit has been
identified from testing and benchmarking as a safe boundary
where the group performs reliably on a stable local area
network.

#### Limits on Transaction Size

If an individual transaction results in message contents which
are large enough that the message cannot be copied between group
members over the network within a 5-second window, members can
be suspected of having failed, and then expelled, just because
they are busy processing the transaction. Large transactions can
also cause the system to slow due to problems with memory
allocation. To avoid these issues use the following mitigations:

- If unnecessary expulsions occur due to large messages, use
  the system variable
  [`group_replication_member_expel_timeout`](group-replication-system-variables.md#sysvar_group_replication_member_expel_timeout)
  to allow additional time before a member under suspicion of
  having failed is expelled. You can allow up to an hour after
  the initial 5-second detection period before a suspect
  member is expelled from the group. From MySQL 8.0.21, an
  additional 5 seconds is allowed by default.
- Where possible, try and limit the size of your transactions
  before they are handled by Group Replication. For example,
  split up files used with `LOAD DATA` into
  smaller chunks.
- Use the system variable
  [`group_replication_transaction_size_limit`](group-replication-system-variables.md#sysvar_group_replication_transaction_size_limit)
  to specify a maximum transaction size that the group
  accepts. In MySQL 8.0, this system variable defaults to a
  maximum transaction size of 150000000 bytes (approximately
  143 MB). Transactions above this size are rolled back and
  are not sent to Group Replication's Group Communication
  System (GCS) for distribution to the group. Adjust the value
  of this variable depending on the maximum message size that
  you need the group to tolerate, bearing in mind that the
  time taken to process a transaction is proportional to its
  size.
- Use the system variable
  [`group_replication_compression_threshold`](group-replication-system-variables.md#sysvar_group_replication_compression_threshold)
  to specify a message size above which compression is
  applied. This system variable defaults to 1000000 bytes (1
  MB), so large messages are automatically compressed.
  Compression is carried out by Group Replication's Group
  Communication System (GCS) when it receives a message that
  was permitted by the
  [`group_replication_transaction_size_limit`](group-replication-system-variables.md#sysvar_group_replication_transaction_size_limit)
  setting but exceeds the
  [`group_replication_compression_threshold`](group-replication-system-variables.md#sysvar_group_replication_compression_threshold)
  setting. For more information, see
  [Section 20.7.4, “Message Compression”](group-replication-message-compression.md "20.7.4 Message Compression").
- Use the system variable
  [`group_replication_communication_max_message_size`](group-replication-system-variables.md#sysvar_group_replication_communication_max_message_size)
  to specify a message size above which messages are
  fragmented. This system variable defaults to 10485760 bytes
  (10 MiB), so large messages are automatically fragmented.
  GCS carries out fragmentation after compression if the
  compressed message still exceeds the
  [`group_replication_communication_max_message_size`](group-replication-system-variables.md#sysvar_group_replication_communication_max_message_size)
  limit. In order for a replication group to use
  fragmentation, all group members must be at MySQL 8.0.16 or
  above, and the Group Replication communication protocol
  version in use by the group must allow fragmentation. For
  more information, see
  [Section 20.7.5, “Message Fragmentation”](group-replication-performance-message-fragmentation.md "20.7.5 Message Fragmentation").

The maximum transaction size, message compression, and message
fragmentation can all be deactivated by specifying a zero value
for the relevant system variable. If you have deactivated all
these safeguards, the upper size limit for a message that can be
handled by the applier thread on a member of a replication group
is the value of the member's
[`replica_max_allowed_packet`](replication-options-replica.md#sysvar_replica_max_allowed_packet) or
[`slave_max_allowed_packet`](replication-options-replica.md#sysvar_slave_max_allowed_packet) system
variable, which have a default and maximum value of 1073741824
bytes (1 GB). A message that exceeds this limit fails when the
receiving member attempts to handle it. The upper size limit for
a message that a group member can originate and attempt to
transmit to the group is 4294967295 bytes (approximately 4 GB).
This is a hard limit on the packet size that is accepted by the
group communication engine for Group Replication (XCom, a Paxos
variant), which receives messages after GCS has handled them. A
message that exceeds this limit fails when the originating
member attempts to broadcast it.
