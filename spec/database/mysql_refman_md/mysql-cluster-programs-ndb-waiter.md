### 25.5.30 ndb\_waiter — Wait for NDB Cluster to Reach a Given Status

[**ndb\_waiter**](mysql-cluster-programs-ndb-waiter.md "25.5.30 ndb_waiter — Wait for NDB Cluster to Reach a Given Status") repeatedly (each 100 milliseconds)
prints out the status of all cluster data nodes until either the
cluster reaches a given status or the
[`--timeout`](mysql-cluster-programs-ndb-waiter.md#option_ndb_waiter_timeout) limit is exceeded,
then exits. By default, it waits for the cluster to achieve
`STARTED` status, in which all nodes have
started and connected to the cluster. This can be overridden
using the [`--no-contact`](mysql-cluster-programs-ndb-waiter.md#option_ndb_waiter_no-contact) and
[`--not-started`](mysql-cluster-programs-ndb-waiter.md#option_ndb_waiter_not-started) options.

The node states reported by this utility are as follows:

- `NO_CONTACT`: The node cannot be contacted.
- `UNKNOWN`: The node can be contacted, but
  its status is not yet known. Usually, this means that the
  node has received a
  [`START`](mysql-cluster-mgm-client-commands.md#ndbclient-start) or
  [`RESTART`](mysql-cluster-mgm-client-commands.md#ndbclient-restart) command from the
  management server, but has not yet acted on it.
- `NOT_STARTED`: The node has stopped, but
  remains in contact with the cluster. This is seen when
  restarting the node using the management client's
  `RESTART` command.
- `STARTING`: The node's
  [**ndbd**](mysql-cluster-programs-ndbd.md "25.5.1 ndbd — The NDB Cluster Data Node Daemon") process has started, but the node
  has not yet joined the cluster.
- `STARTED`: The node is operational, and has
  joined the cluster.
- `SHUTTING_DOWN`: The node is shutting down.
- `SINGLE USER MODE`: This is shown for all
  cluster data nodes when the cluster is in single user mode.

Options that can be used with [**ndb\_waiter**](mysql-cluster-programs-ndb-waiter.md "25.5.30 ndb_waiter — Wait for NDB Cluster to Reach a Given Status") are
shown in the following table. Additional descriptions follow the

  not wait for the nodes whose IDs are listed. The list is
  comma-delimited; ranges can be indicated by dashes, as shown
  here:

  | --- | --- |
  | Command-Line Format | `--verbose=#` |
  | Introduced | 8.0.37 |
  | Type | Integer |
  | Default Value | `2` |
  | Minimum Value | `0` |
  | Maximum Value | `2` |

  Controls verbosity level of printout. Possible levels and
  their effects are listed here:

  - `0`: Do not print (return exit code
    only; see following for exit codes).
  - `1`: Print final connection status
    only.
  - `2`: Print status each time it is
    checked.

    This is the same behavior as in versions of NDB Cluster
    previous to 8.4.

  Exit codes returned by [**ndb\_waiter**](mysql-cluster-programs-ndb-waiter.md "25.5.30 ndb_waiter — Wait for NDB Cluster to Reach a Given Status") are
  listed here, with their meanings:

  - `0`: Success.
  - `1`: Wait timed out.
  - `2`: Parameter error, such as an
    invalid node ID.
  - `3`: Failed to connect to the
    management server.
- [`--version`](mysql-cluster-programs-ndb-waiter.md#option_ndb_waiter_version)

  |  |  |
  | --- | --- |
  | Command-Line Format | `--version` |

  Display version information and exit.
- [`--wait-nodes=list`](mysql-cluster-programs-ndb-waiter.md#option_ndb_waiter_wait-nodes),
  `-w list`

  When this option is used, [**ndb\_waiter**](mysql-cluster-programs-ndb-waiter.md "25.5.30 ndb_waiter — Wait for NDB Cluster to Reach a Given Status")
  waits only for the nodes whose IDs are listed. The list is
  comma-delimited; ranges can be indicated by dashes, as shown
  here:

  ```terminal
  $> ndb_waiter --wait-nodes=2,4-6,10
  ```

  Important

  Do *not* use this option together with
  the [`--nowait-nodes`](mysql-cluster-programs-ndb-waiter.md#option_ndb_waiter_nowait-nodes)
  option.

**Sample Output.**
Shown here is the output from [**ndb\_waiter**](mysql-cluster-programs-ndb-waiter.md "25.5.30 ndb_waiter — Wait for NDB Cluster to Reach a Given Status")
when run against a 4-node cluster in which two nodes have been
shut down and then started again manually. Duplicate reports
(indicated by `...`) are omitted.

```terminal
$> ./ndb_waiter -c localhost

```

Note

If no connection string is specified, then
[**ndb\_waiter**](mysql-cluster-programs-ndb-waiter.md "25.5.30 ndb_waiter — Wait for NDB Cluster to Reach a Given Status") tries to connect to a management
on `localhost`, and reports
`Connecting to mgmsrv at (null)`.

Prior to NDB 8.0.20, this program printed
`NDBT_ProgramExit -
status` upon completion of
its run, due to an unnecessary dependency on the
`NDBT` testing library. This dependency has
been removed, eliminating the extraneous output.
