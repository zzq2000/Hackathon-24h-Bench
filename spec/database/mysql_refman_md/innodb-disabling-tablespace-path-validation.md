#### 17.6.3.7 Disabling Tablespace Path Validation

At startup, `InnoDB` scans directories defined by
the [`innodb_directories`](innodb-parameters.md#sysvar_innodb_directories) variable
for tablespace files. The paths of discovered tablespace files are
validated against the paths recorded in the data dictionary. If
the paths do not match, the paths in the data dictionary are
updated.

The
[`innodb_validate_tablespace_paths`](innodb-parameters.md#sysvar_innodb_validate_tablespace_paths)
variable, introduced in MySQL 8.0.21, permits disabling tablespace
path validation. This feature is intended for environments where
tablespace files are not moved. Disabling path validation improves
startup time on systems with a large number of tablespace files.
If [`log_error_verbosity`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_log_error_verbosity) is
set to 3, the following message is printed at startup when
tablespace path validation is disabled:

```terminal
[InnoDB] Skipping InnoDB tablespace path validation.
Manually moved tablespace files will not be detected!
```

Warning

Starting the server with tablespace path validation disabled
after moving tablespace files can lead to undefined behavior.
