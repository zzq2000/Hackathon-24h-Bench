## 2.10 Perl Installation Notes

[2.10.1 Installing Perl on Unix](perl-installation.md)

[2.10.2 Installing ActiveState Perl on Windows](activestate-perl.md)

[2.10.3 Problems Using the Perl DBI/DBD Interface](perl-support-problems.md)

The Perl `DBI` module provides a generic interface
for database access. You can write a `DBI` script
that works with many different database engines without change. To
use `DBI`, you must install the
`DBI` module, as well as a DataBase Driver (DBD)
module for each type of database server you want to access. For
MySQL, this driver is the `DBD::mysql` module.

Note

Perl support is not included with MySQL distributions. You can
obtain the necessary modules from
<http://search.cpan.org> for Unix, or by using the
ActiveState **ppm** program on Windows. The
following sections describe how to do this.

The `DBI`/`DBD` interface requires
Perl 5.6.0, and 5.6.1 or later is preferred. DBI *does not
work* if you have an older version of Perl. You should use
`DBD::mysql` 4.009 or higher. Although earlier
versions are available, they do not support the full functionality
of MySQL 8.0.
