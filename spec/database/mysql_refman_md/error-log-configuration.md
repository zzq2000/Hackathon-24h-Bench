#### 7.4.2.1 Error Log Configuration

In MySQL 8.0, error logging uses the MySQL
component architecture described at
[Section 7.5, “MySQL Components”](components.md "7.5 MySQL Components"). The error log subsystem consists
of components that perform log event filtering and writing, as
well as a system variable that configures which components to
load and enable to achieve the desired logging result.

This section discusses how to load and enable components for
error logging. For instructions specific to log filters, see
[Section 7.4.2.4, “Types of Error Log Filtering”](error-log-filtering.md "7.4.2.4 Types of Error Log Filtering"). For instructions specific
to the JSON and system log sinks, see
[Section 7.4.2.7, “Error Logging in JSON Format”](error-log-json.md "7.4.2.7 Error Logging in JSON Format"), and
[Section 7.4.2.8, “Error Logging to the System Log”](error-log-syslog.md "7.4.2.8 Error Logging to the System Log"). For additional details about
all available log components, see
[Section 7.5.3, “Error Log Components”](error-log-components.md "7.5.3 Error Log Components").

Component-based error logging offers these features:

- Log events that can be filtered by filter components to
  affect the information available for writing.
- Log events that are output by sink (writer) components.
  Multiple sink components can be enabled, to write error log
  output to multiple destinations.
- Built-in filter and sink components that implement the
  default error log format.
- A loadable sink that enables logging in JSON format.
- A loadable sink that enables logging to the system log.
- System variables that control which log components to load
  and enable and how each component operates.

Error log configuration is described under the following topics
in this section:

- [The Default Error Log Configuration](error-log-configuration.md#error-log-default-configuration "The Default Error Log Configuration")
- [Error Log Configuration Methods](error-log-configuration.md#error-log-configuration-methods "Error Log Configuration Methods")
- [Implicit Error Log Configuration](error-log-configuration.md#error-log-implicit-configuration "Implicit Error Log Configuration")
- [Explicit Error Log Configuration](error-log-configuration.md#error-log-explicit-configuration "Explicit Error Log Configuration")
- [Changing the Error Log Configuration Method](error-log-configuration.md#error-log-configuration-change-method "Changing the Error Log Configuration Method")
- [Troubleshooting Configuration Issues](error-log-configuration.md#error-log-configuration-troubleshooting "Troubleshooting Configuration Issues")
- [Configuring Multiple Log Sinks](error-log-configuration.md#error-log-configuration-multiple-log-sinks "Configuring Multiple Log Sinks")
- [Log Sink Performance Schema Support](error-log-configuration.md#error-log-configuration-log-sink-ps-support "Log Sink Performance Schema Support")

##### The Default Error Log Configuration

The [`log_error_services`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_log_error_services) system
variable controls which loadable log components to load (as of
MySQL 8.0.30) and which log components to enable for error
logging. By default,
[`log_error_services`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_log_error_services) has this
value:

```sql
mysql> SELECT @@GLOBAL.log_error_services;
+----------------------------------------+
| @@GLOBAL.log_error_services            |
+----------------------------------------+
| log_filter_internal; log_sink_internal |
+----------------------------------------+
```

That value indicates that log events first pass through the
`log_filter_internal` filter component, then
through the `log_sink_internal` sink
component, both of which are built-in components. A filter
modifies log events seen by components named later in the
[`log_error_services`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_log_error_services) value. A
sink is a destination for log events. Typically, a sink
processes log events into log messages that have a particular
format and writes these messages to its associated output,
such as a file or the system log.

The combination of `log_filter_internal` and
`log_sink_internal` implements the default
error log filtering and output behavior. The action of these
components is affected by other server options and system
variables:

- The output destination is determined by the
  [`--log-error`](server-options.md#option_mysqld_log-error) option (and, on
  Windows, [`--pid-file`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_pid_file) and
  [`--console`](server-options.md#option_mysqld_console)). These determine
  whether to write error messages to the console or a file
  and, if to a file, the error log file name. See
  [Section 7.4.2.2, “Default Error Log Destination Configuration”](error-log-destination-configuration.md "7.4.2.2 Default Error Log Destination Configuration").
- The [`log_error_verbosity`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_log_error_verbosity)
  and
  [`log_error_suppression_list`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_log_error_suppression_list)
  system variables affect which types of log events
  `log_filter_internal` permits or
  suppresses. See
  [Section 7.4.2.5, “Priority-Based Error Log Filtering (log\_filter\_internal)”](error-log-priority-based-filtering.md "7.4.2.5 Priority-Based Error Log Filtering (log_filter_internal)").

When configuring
[`log_error_services`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_log_error_services), be aware
of the following characteristics:

- A list of log components may be delimited by semicolon or
  (as of MySQL 8.0.12) comma, optionally followed by space.
  A given setting cannot use both semicolon and comma
  separators. Component order is significant because the
  server executes components in the order listed.
- The final component in the
  [`log_error_services`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_log_error_services) value
  cannot be a filter. This is an error because any changes
  it has on events would have no effect on output:

  ```sql
  mysql> SET GLOBAL log_error_services = 'log_filter_internal';
  ERROR 1231 (42000): Variable 'log_error_services' can't be set to the value
  of 'log_filter_internal'
  ```

  To correct the problem, include a sink at the end of the
  value:

  ```sql
  mysql> SET GLOBAL log_error_services = 'log_filter_internal; log_sink_internal';
  ```
- The order of components named in
  [`log_error_services`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_log_error_services) is
  significant, particularly with respect to the relative
  order of filters and sinks. Consider this
  [`log_error_services`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_log_error_services) value:

  ```none
  log_filter_internal; log_sink_1; log_sink_2
  ```

  In this case, log events pass to the built-in filter, then
  to the first sink, then to the second sink. Both sinks
  receive the filtered log events.

  Compare that to this
  [`log_error_services`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_log_error_services) value:

  ```none
  log_sink_1; log_filter_internal; log_sink_2
  ```

  In this case, log events pass to the first sink, then to
  the built-in filter, then to the second sink. The first
  sink receives unfiltered events. The second sink receives
  filtered events. You might configure error logging this
  way if you want one log that contains messages for all log
  events, and another log that contains messages only for a
  subset of log events.

##### Error Log Configuration Methods

Error log configuration involves loading and enabling error
log components as necessary and performing component-specific
configuration.

There are two error log configuration methods,
*implicit* and
*explicit*. It is recommended that one
configuration method is selected and used exclusively. Using
both methods can result in warnings at startup. For more
information, see
[Troubleshooting Configuration Issues](error-log-configuration.md#error-log-configuration-troubleshooting "Troubleshooting Configuration Issues").

- *Implicit Error Log Configuration*
  (introduced in MySQL 8.0.30)

  This configuration method loads and enables the log
  components defined by the
  [`log_error_services`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_log_error_services)
  variable. Loadable components that are not already loaded
  are loaded implicitly at startup before the
  `InnoDB` storage engine is fully
  available. This configuration method has the following
  advantages:

  - Log components are loaded early in the startup
    sequence, before the `InnoDB` storage
    engine, making logged information available sooner.
  - It avoids loss of buffered log information should a
    failure occur during startup.
  - Installing error log components using
    [`INSTALL COMPONENT`](install-component.md "15.7.4.3 INSTALL COMPONENT Statement") is
    not required, simplifying error log configuration.

  To use this method, see
  [Implicit Error Log Configuration](error-log-configuration.md#error-log-implicit-configuration "Implicit Error Log Configuration").

- *Explicit Error Log Configuration*

  Note

  This configuration method is supported for backward
  compatibility. The implicit configuration method,
  introduced in MySQL 8.0.30, is recommended.

  This configuration method requires loading error log
  components using [`INSTALL
  COMPONENT`](install-component.md "15.7.4.3 INSTALL COMPONENT Statement") and then configuring
  [`log_error_services`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_log_error_services) to
  enable the log components. [`INSTALL
  COMPONENT`](install-component.md "15.7.4.3 INSTALL COMPONENT Statement") adds the component to the
  `mysql.component` table (an
  `InnoDB` table), and the components to
  load at startup are read from this table, which is only
  accessible after `InnoDB` is initialized.

  Logged information is buffered during the startup sequence
  while the `InnoDB` storage engine is
  initialized, which is sometimes prolonged by operations
  such as recovery and data dictionary upgrade that occur
  during the `InnoDB` startup sequence.

  To use this method, see
  [Explicit Error Log Configuration](error-log-configuration.md#error-log-explicit-configuration "Explicit Error Log Configuration").

##### Implicit Error Log Configuration

This procedure describes how to load and enable error logging
components implicitly using
[`log_error_services`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_log_error_services). For a
discussion of error log configuration methods, see
[Error Log Configuration Methods](error-log-configuration.md#error-log-configuration-methods "Error Log Configuration Methods").

To load and enable error logging components implicitly:

1. List the error log components in the
   [`log_error_services`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_log_error_services) value.

   To load and enable the error log components at server
   startup, set
   [`log_error_services`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_log_error_services) in an
   option file. The following example configures the use of
   the JSON log sink (`log_sink_json`) in
   addition to the built-in log filter and sink
   (`log_filter_internal`,
   `log_sink_internal`).

   ```ini
   [mysqld]
   log_error_services='log_filter_internal; log_sink_internal; log_sink_json'
   ```

   Note

   To use the JSON log sink
   (`log_sink_syseventlog`) instead of the
   default sink (`log_sink_internal`), you
   would replace `log_sink_internal` with
   `log_sink_json`.

   To load and enable the component immediately and for
   subsequent restarts, set
   [`log_error_services`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_log_error_services) using
   [`SET
   PERSIST`](set-variable.md "15.7.6.1 SET Syntax for Variable Assignment"):

   ```sql
   SET PERSIST log_error_services = 'log_filter_internal; log_sink_internal; log_sink_json';
   ```
2. If the error log component exposes any system variables
   that must be set for component initialization to succeed,
   assign those variables appropriate values. You can set
   these variables in an option file or using
   [`SET
   PERSIST`](set-variable.md "15.7.6.1 SET Syntax for Variable Assignment").

   Important

   When implementing an implicit configuration, set
   [`log_error_services`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_log_error_services)
   first to load a component and expose its system
   variables, and then set component system variables
   afterward. This configuration order is required
   regardless of whether variable assignment is performed
   on the command-line, in an option file, or using
   [`SET
   PERSIST`](set-variable.md "15.7.6.1 SET Syntax for Variable Assignment").

To disable a log component, remove it from the
[`log_error_services`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_log_error_services) value.
Also remove any associated component variables settings that
you have defined.

Note

Loading a log component implicitly using
[`log_error_services`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_log_error_services) has no
effect on the `mysql.component` table. It
does not add the component to the
`mysql.component` table, nor does it remove
a component previously installed using
[`INSTALL COMPONENT`](install-component.md "15.7.4.3 INSTALL COMPONENT Statement") from the
`mysql.component` table.

##### Explicit Error Log Configuration

This procedure describes how to load and enable error logging
components explicitly by loading components using
[`INSTALL COMPONENT`](install-component.md "15.7.4.3 INSTALL COMPONENT Statement") and then
enabling using
[`log_error_services`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_log_error_services). For a
discussion of error log configuration methods, see
[Error Log Configuration Methods](error-log-configuration.md#error-log-configuration-methods "Error Log Configuration Methods").

To load and enable error logging components explicitly:

1. Load the component using [`INSTALL
   COMPONENT`](install-component.md "15.7.4.3 INSTALL COMPONENT Statement") (unless it is built in or already
   loaded). For example, to load the JSON log sink, issue the
   following statement:

   ```sql
   INSTALL COMPONENT 'file://component_log_sink_json';
   ```

   Loading a component using [`INSTALL
   COMPONENT`](install-component.md "15.7.4.3 INSTALL COMPONENT Statement") registers it in the
   `mysql.component` system table so that
   the server loads it automatically for subsequent startups,
   after `InnoDB` is initialized.

   The URN to use when loading a log component with
   [`INSTALL COMPONENT`](install-component.md "15.7.4.3 INSTALL COMPONENT Statement") is the
   component name prefixed with
   `file://component_`. For example, for the
   `log_sink_json` component, the
   corresponding URN is
   `file://component_log_sink_json`. For
   error log component URNs, see
   [Section 7.5.3, “Error Log Components”](error-log-components.md "7.5.3 Error Log Components").
2. If the error log component exposes any system variables
   that must be set for component initialization to succeed,
   assign those variables appropriate values. You can set
   these variables in an option file or using
   [`SET
   PERSIST`](set-variable.md "15.7.6.1 SET Syntax for Variable Assignment").
3. Enable the component by listing it in the
   [`log_error_services`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_log_error_services) value.

   Important

   From MySQL 8.0.30, when loading log components
   explicitly using [`INSTALL
   COMPONENT`](install-component.md "15.7.4.3 INSTALL COMPONENT Statement"), do not persist or set
   [`log_error_services`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_log_error_services) in
   an option file, which loads log components implicitly at
   startup. Instead, enable log components at runtime using
   a `SET
   GLOBAL` statement.

   The following example configures the use of the JSON log
   sink (`log_sink_json`) in addition to the
   built-in log filter and sink
   (`log_filter_internal`,
   `log_sink_internal`).

   ```sql
   SET GLOBAL log_error_services = 'log_filter_internal; log_sink_internal; log_sink_json';
   ```

   Note

   To use the JSON log sink
   (`log_sink_syseventlog`) instead of the
   default sink (`log_sink_internal`), you
   would replace `log_sink_internal` with
   `log_sink_json`.

To disable a log component, remove it from the
[`log_error_services`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_log_error_services) value.
Then, if the component is loadable and you also want to unload
it, use [`UNINSTALL COMPONENT`](uninstall-component.md "15.7.4.5 UNINSTALL COMPONENT Statement").
Also remove any associated component variables settings that
you have defined.

Attempts to use [`UNINSTALL
COMPONENT`](uninstall-component.md "15.7.4.5 UNINSTALL COMPONENT Statement") to unload a loadable component that is
still named in the
[`log_error_services`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_log_error_services) value
produce an error.

##### Changing the Error Log Configuration Method

If you have previously loaded error log components explicitly
using [`INSTALL COMPONENT`](install-component.md "15.7.4.3 INSTALL COMPONENT Statement") and
want to switch to an implicit configuration, as described in
[Implicit Error Log Configuration](error-log-configuration.md#error-log-implicit-configuration "Implicit Error Log Configuration"), the
following steps are recommended:

1. Set [`log_error_services`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_log_error_services)
   back to its default configuration.

   ```sql
   SET GLOBAL log_error_services = 'log_filter_internal,log_sink_internal';
   ```
2. Use [`UNINSTALL COMPONENT`](uninstall-component.md "15.7.4.5 UNINSTALL COMPONENT Statement") to
   uninstall any loadable logging components that you
   installed previously. For example, if you installed the
   JSON log sink previously, uninstall it as shown:

   ```sql
   UNINSTALL COMPONENT 'file://component_log_sink_json';
   ```
3. Remove any component variable settings for the uninstalled
   component. For example, if component variables were set in
   an option file, remove the settings from the option file.
   If component variables were set using
   [`SET
   PERSIST`](set-variable.md "15.7.6.1 SET Syntax for Variable Assignment"), use
   [`RESET
   PERSIST`](set-variable.md "15.7.6.1 SET Syntax for Variable Assignment") to clear the settings.
4. Follow the steps in
   [Implicit Error Log Configuration](error-log-configuration.md#error-log-implicit-configuration "Implicit Error Log Configuration") to
   reimplement your configuration.

If you need to revert from an implicit configuration to an
explicit configuration, perform the following steps:

1. Set [`log_error_services`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_log_error_services)
   back to its default configuration to unload implicitly
   loaded log components.

   ```sql
   SET GLOBAL log_error_services = 'log_filter_internal,log_sink_internal';
   ```
2. Remove any component variable settings associated with the
   uninstalled components. For example, if component
   variables were set in an option file, remove the settings
   from the option file. If component variables were set
   using [`SET
   PERSIST`](set-variable.md "15.7.6.1 SET Syntax for Variable Assignment"), use
   [`RESET
   PERSIST`](set-variable.md "15.7.6.1 SET Syntax for Variable Assignment") to clear the settings.
3. Restart the server to uninstall the log components that
   were implicitly loaded.
4. Follow the steps in
   [Explicit Error Log Configuration](error-log-configuration.md#error-log-explicit-configuration "Explicit Error Log Configuration") to
   reimplement your configuration.

##### Troubleshooting Configuration Issues

From MySQL 8.0.30, log components listed in the
[`log_error_services`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_log_error_services) value at
startup are loaded implicitly early in the MySQL Server
startup sequence. If the log component was loaded previously
using [`INSTALL COMPONENT`](install-component.md "15.7.4.3 INSTALL COMPONENT Statement"), the
server attempts to load the component again later in the
startup sequence, which produces the following warning:

```terminal
Cannot load component from specified URN: 'file://component_component_name'
```

You can check for this warning in the error log or by querying
the Performance Schema [`error_log`](performance-schema-error-log-table.md "29.12.21.2 The error_log Table")
table using the following query:

```sql
SELECT error_code, data
  FROM performance_schema.error_log
 WHERE data LIKE "%'file://component_%"
   AND error_code="MY-013129" AND data LIKE "%MY-003529%";
```

To prevent this warning, follow the instructions in
[Changing the Error Log Configuration Method](error-log-configuration.md#error-log-configuration-change-method "Changing the Error Log Configuration Method") to
adjust your error log configuration. Either an implicit or
explicit error log configuration should be used, but not both.

A similar error occurs when attempting to explicitly load a
component that was implicitly loaded at startup. For example,
if [`log_error_services`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_log_error_services) lists
the JSON log sink component, that component is implicitly
loaded at startup. Attempting to explicitly load the same
component later returns this error:

```sql
mysql> INSTALL COMPONENT 'file://component_log_sink_json';
ERROR 3529 (HY000): Cannot load component from specified URN: 'file://component_log_sink_json'.
```

##### Configuring Multiple Log Sinks

It is possible to configure multiple log sinks, which enables
sending output to multiple destinations. To enable the JSON
log sink in addition to (rather than instead of) the default
sink, set the
[`log_error_services`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_log_error_services) value like
this:

```sql
SET GLOBAL log_error_services = 'log_filter_internal; log_sink_internal; log_sink_json';
```

To revert to using only the default sink and unload the system
log sink, execute these statements:

```sql
SET GLOBAL log_error_services = 'log_filter_internal; log_sink_internal;
UNINSTALL COMPONENT 'file://component_log_sink_json';
```

##### Log Sink Performance Schema Support

If enabled log components include a sink that provides
Performance Schema support, events written to the error log
are also written to the Performance Schema
[`error_log`](performance-schema-error-log-table.md "29.12.21.2 The error_log Table") table. This enables
examining error log contents using SQL queries. Currently, the
traditional-format `log_sink_internal` and
JSON-format `log_sink_json` sinks support
this capability. See
[Section 29.12.21.2, “The error\_log Table”](performance-schema-error-log-table.md "29.12.21.2 The error_log Table").
