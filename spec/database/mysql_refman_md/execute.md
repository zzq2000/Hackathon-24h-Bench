### 15.5.2 EXECUTE Statement

```sql
EXECUTE stmt_name
    [USING @var_name [, @var_name] ...]
```

After preparing a statement with
[`PREPARE`](prepare.md "15.5.1 PREPARE Statement"), you execute it with an
[`EXECUTE`](execute.md "15.5.2 EXECUTE Statement") statement that refers to
the prepared statement name. If the prepared statement contains
any parameter markers, you must supply a `USING`
clause that lists user variables containing the values to be bound
to the parameters. Parameter values can be supplied only by user
variables, and the `USING` clause must name
exactly as many variables as the number of parameter markers in
the statement.

You can execute a given prepared statement multiple times, passing
different variables to it or setting the variables to different
values before each execution.

For examples, see [Section 15.5, “Prepared Statements”](sql-prepared-statements.md "15.5 Prepared Statements").
