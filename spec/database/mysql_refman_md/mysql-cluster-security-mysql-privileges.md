#### 25.6.20.2 NDB Cluster and MySQL Privileges

In this section, we discuss how the MySQL privilege system works
in relation to NDB Cluster and the implications of this for
keeping an NDB Cluster secure.

Standard MySQL privileges apply to NDB Cluster tables. This
includes all MySQL privilege types
([`SELECT`](privileges-provided.md#priv_select) privilege,
[`UPDATE`](privileges-provided.md#priv_update) privilege,
[`DELETE`](privileges-provided.md#priv_delete) privilege, and so on)
granted on the database, table, and column level. As with any
other MySQL Server, user and privilege information is stored in
the `mysql` system database. The SQL statements
used to grant and revoke privileges on
[`NDB`](mysql-cluster.md "Chapter 25 MySQL NDB Cluster 8.0") tables, databases containing
such tables, and columns within such tables are identical in all
respects with the [`GRANT`](grant.md "15.7.1.6 GRANT Statement") and
[`REVOKE`](revoke.md "15.7.1.8 REVOKE Statement") statements used in
connection with database objects involving any (other) MySQL
storage engine. The same thing is true with respect to the
[`CREATE USER`](create-user.md "15.7.1.3 CREATE USER Statement") and
[`DROP USER`](drop-user.md "15.7.1.5 DROP USER Statement") statements.

It is important to keep in mind that, by default, the MySQL
grant tables use the [`InnoDB`](innodb-storage-engine.md "Chapter 17 The InnoDB Storage Engine") storage
engine. Because of this, those tables are not normally
duplicated or shared among MySQL servers acting as SQL nodes in
an NDB Cluster. In other words, changes in users and their
privileges do not automatically propagate between SQL nodes by
default. If you wish, you can enable synchronization of MySQL
users and privileges across NDB Cluster SQL nodes; see
[Section 25.6.13, “Privilege Synchronization and NDB\_STORED\_USER”](mysql-cluster-privilege-synchronization.md "25.6.13 Privilege Synchronization and NDB_STORED_USER"), for
details.

Conversely, because there is no way in MySQL to deny privileges
(privileges can either be revoked or not granted in the first
place, but not denied as such), there is no special protection
for `NDB` tables on one SQL node from users
that have privileges on another SQL node; this is true even if
you are not using automatic distribution of user privileges. The
definitive example of this is the MySQL `root`
account, which can perform any action on any database object. In
combination with empty `[mysqld]` or
`[api]` sections of the
`config.ini` file, this account can be
especially dangerous. To understand why, consider the following
scenario:

- The `config.ini` file contains at least
  one empty `[mysqld]` or
  `[api]` section. This means that the NDB
  Cluster management server performs no checking of the host
  from which a MySQL Server (or other API node) accesses the
  NDB Cluster.
- There is no firewall, or the firewall fails to protect
  against access to the NDB Cluster from hosts external to the
  network.
- The host name or IP address of the NDB Cluster management
  server is known or can be determined from outside the
  network.

If these conditions are true, then anyone, anywhere can start a
MySQL Server with [`--ndbcluster`](mysql-cluster-options-variables.md#option_mysqld_ndbcluster)
[`--ndb-connectstring=management_host`](mysql-cluster-options-variables.md#option_mysqld_ndb-connectstring)
and access this NDB Cluster. Using the MySQL
`root` account, this person can then perform
the following actions:

- Execute metadata statements such as
  [`SHOW DATABASES`](show-databases.md "15.7.7.14 SHOW DATABASES Statement") statement (to
  obtain a list of all [`NDB`](mysql-cluster.md "Chapter 25 MySQL NDB Cluster 8.0")
  databases on the server) or
  [`SHOW TABLES
  FROM some_ndb_database`](show-tables.md "15.7.7.39 SHOW TABLES Statement")
  statement to obtain a list of all
  [`NDB`](mysql-cluster.md "Chapter 25 MySQL NDB Cluster 8.0") tables in a given database
- Run any legal MySQL statements on any of the discovered
  tables, such as:

  - `SELECT * FROM
    some_table` or
    `TABLE
    some_table` to read
    all the data from any table
  - `DELETE FROM
    some_table` or
    TRUNCATE TABLE to delete all the data from a table
  - `DESCRIBE
    some_table` or
    `SHOW CREATE TABLE
    some_table` to
    determine the table schema
  - `UPDATE some_table
    SET column1 =
    some_value` to fill
    a table column with “garbage” data; this
    could actually cause much greater damage than simply
    deleting all the data

    More insidious variations might include statements like
    these:

    ```sql
    UPDATE some_table SET an_int_column = an_int_column + 1
    ```

    or

    ```sql
    UPDATE some_table SET a_varchar_column = REVERSE(a_varchar_column)
    ```

    Such malicious statements are limited only by the
    imagination of the attacker.

  The only tables that would be safe from this sort of mayhem
  would be those tables that were created using storage
  engines other than `NDB`, and so not
  visible to a “rogue” SQL node.

  A user who can log in as `root` can also
  access the [`INFORMATION_SCHEMA`](information-schema.md "Chapter 28 INFORMATION_SCHEMA Tables")
  database and its tables, and so obtain information about
  databases, tables, stored routines, scheduled events, and
  any other database objects for which metadata is stored in
  `INFORMATION_SCHEMA`.

  It is also a very good idea to use different passwords for
  the `root` accounts on different NDB
  Cluster SQL nodes unless you are using shared privileges.

In sum, you cannot have a safe NDB Cluster if it is directly
accessible from outside your local network.

Important

*Never leave the MySQL root account password
empty*. This is just as true when running MySQL as
an NDB Cluster SQL node as it is when running it as a
standalone (non-Cluster) MySQL Server, and should be done as
part of the MySQL installation process before configuring the
MySQL Server as an SQL node in an NDB Cluster.

If you need to synchronize `mysql` system
tables between SQL nodes, you can use standard MySQL replication
to do so, or employ a script to copy table entries between the
MySQL servers. Users and their privileges can be shared and kept
in synch using the
[`NDB_STORED_USER`](privileges-provided.md#priv_ndb-stored-user) privilege.

**Summary.**
The most important points to remember regarding the MySQL
privilege system with regard to NDB Cluster are listed here:

1. Users and privileges established on one SQL node do not
   automatically exist or take effect on other SQL nodes in the
   cluster. Conversely, removing a user or privilege on one SQL
   node in the cluster does not remove the user or privilege
   from any other SQL nodes.
2. You can share MySQL users and privileges among SQL nodes
   using [`NDB_STORED_USER`](privileges-provided.md#priv_ndb-stored-user).
3. Once a MySQL user is granted privileges on an
   [`NDB`](mysql-cluster.md "Chapter 25 MySQL NDB Cluster 8.0") table from one SQL node in
   an NDB Cluster, that user can “see” any data in
   that table regardless of the SQL node from which the data
   originated, even if that user is not shared.
