### 7.4.6 Server Log Maintenance

As described in [Section 7.4, “MySQL Server Logs”](server-logs.md "7.4 MySQL Server Logs"), MySQL Server can
create several different log files to help you see what activity
is taking place. However, you must clean up these files regularly
to ensure that the logs do not take up too much disk space.

When using MySQL with logging enabled, you may want to back up and
remove old log files from time to time and tell MySQL to start
logging to new files. See [Section 9.2, “Database Backup Methods”](backup-methods.md "9.2 Database Backup Methods").

On a Linux (Red Hat) installation, you can use the
`mysql-log-rotate` script for log maintenance. If
you installed MySQL from an RPM distribution, this script should
have been installed automatically. Be careful with this script if
you are using the binary log for replication. You should not
remove binary logs until you are certain that their contents have
been processed by all replicas.

On other systems, you must install a short script yourself that
you start from **cron** (or its equivalent) for
handling log files.

Binary log files are automatically removed after the server's
binary log expiration period. Removal of the files can take place
at startup and when the binary log is flushed. The default binary
log expiration period is 30 days. To specify an alternative
expiration period, use the
[`binlog_expire_logs_seconds`](replication-options-binary-log.md#sysvar_binlog_expire_logs_seconds) system
variable. If you are using replication, you should specify an
expiration period that is no lower than the maximum amount of time
your replicas might lag behind the source. To remove binary logs
on demand, use the [`PURGE BINARY
LOGS`](purge-binary-logs.md "15.4.1.1 PURGE BINARY LOGS Statement") statement (see
[Section 15.4.1.1, “PURGE BINARY LOGS Statement”](purge-binary-logs.md "15.4.1.1 PURGE BINARY LOGS Statement")).

To force MySQL to start using new log files, flush the logs. Log
flushing occurs when you execute a [`FLUSH
LOGS`](flush.md#flush-logs) statement or a [**mysqladmin
flush-logs**](mysqladmin.md "6.5.2 mysqladmin — A MySQL Server Administration Program"), [**mysqladmin refresh**](mysqladmin.md "6.5.2 mysqladmin — A MySQL Server Administration Program"),
[**mysqldump --flush-logs**](mysqldump.md "6.5.4 mysqldump — A Database Backup Program"), or [**mysqldump
--master-data**](mysqldump.md "6.5.4 mysqldump — A Database Backup Program") command. See [Section 15.7.8.3, “FLUSH Statement”](flush.md "15.7.8.3 FLUSH Statement"),
[Section 6.5.2, “mysqladmin — A MySQL Server Administration Program”](mysqladmin.md "6.5.2 mysqladmin — A MySQL Server Administration Program"), and [Section 6.5.4, “mysqldump — A Database Backup Program”](mysqldump.md "6.5.4 mysqldump — A Database Backup Program"). In
addition, the server flushes the binary log automatically when
current binary log file size reaches the value of the
[`max_binlog_size`](replication-options-binary-log.md#sysvar_max_binlog_size) system variable.

[`FLUSH LOGS`](flush.md#flush-logs) supports optional
modifiers to enable selective flushing of individual logs (for
example, [`FLUSH BINARY LOGS`](flush.md#flush-binary-logs)). See
[Section 15.7.8.3, “FLUSH Statement”](flush.md "15.7.8.3 FLUSH Statement").

A log-flushing operation has the following effects:

- If binary logging is enabled, the server closes the current
  binary log file and opens a new log file with the next
  sequence number.
- If general query logging or slow query logging to a log file
  is enabled, the server closes and reopens the log file.
- If the server was started with the
  [`--log-error`](server-options.md#option_mysqld_log-error) option to cause the
  error log to be written to a file, the server closes and
  reopens the log file.

Execution of log-flushing statements or commands requires
connecting to the server using an account that has the
[`RELOAD`](privileges-provided.md#priv_reload) privilege. On Unix and
Unix-like systems, another way to flush the logs is to send a
signal to the server, which can be done by `root`
or the account that owns the server process. (See
[Section 6.10, “Unix Signal Handling in MySQL”](unix-signal-response.md "6.10 Unix Signal Handling in MySQL").) Signals enable log
flushing to be performed without having to connect to the server:

- A `SIGHUP` signal flushes all the logs.
  However, `SIGHUP` has additional effects
  other than log flushing that might be undesirable.
- As of MySQL 8.0.19, `SIGUSR1` causes the
  server to flush the error log, general query log, and slow
  query log. If you are interested in flushing only those logs,
  `SIGUSR1` can be used as a more
  “lightweight” signal that does not have the
  `SIGHUP` effects that are unrelated to logs.

As mentioned previously, flushing the binary log creates a new
binary log file, whereas flushing the general query log, slow
query log, or error log just closes and reopens the log file. For
the latter logs, to cause a new log file to be created on Unix,
rename the current log file first before flushing it. At flush
time, the server opens the new log file with the original name.
For example, if the general query log, slow query log, and error
log files are named `mysql.log`,
`mysql-slow.log`, and
`err.log`, you can use a series of commands
like this from the command line:

```terminal
cd mysql-data-directory
mv mysql.log mysql.log.old
mv mysql-slow.log mysql-slow.log.old
mv err.log err.log.old
mysqladmin flush-logs
```

On Windows, use **rename** rather than
**mv**.

At this point, you can make a backup of
`mysql.log.old`,
`mysql-slow.log.old`, and
`err.log.old`, then remove them from disk.

To rename the general query log or slow query log at runtime,
first connect to the server and disable the log:

```sql
SET GLOBAL general_log = 'OFF';
SET GLOBAL slow_query_log = 'OFF';
```

With the logs disabled, rename the log files externally (for
example, from the command line). Then enable the logs again:

```sql
SET GLOBAL general_log = 'ON';
SET GLOBAL slow_query_log = 'ON';
```

This method works on any platform and does not require a server
restart.

Note

For the server to recreate a given log file after you have
renamed the file externally, the file location must be writable
by the server. This may not always be the case. For example, on
Linux, the server might write the error log as
`/var/log/mysqld.log`, where
`/var/log` is owned by
`root` and not writable by
[**mysqld**](mysqld.md "6.3.1 mysqld — The MySQL Server"). In this case, log-flushing operations
fail to create a new log file.

To handle this situation, you must manually create the new log
file with the proper ownership after renaming the original log
file. For example, execute these commands as
`root`:

```terminal
mv /var/log/mysqld.log /var/log/mysqld.log.old
install -omysql -gmysql -m0644 /dev/null /var/log/mysqld.log
```
