#### 20.1.3.2 Multi-Primary Mode

In multi-primary mode
([`group_replication_single_primary_mode=OFF`](group-replication-system-variables.md#sysvar_group_replication_single_primary_mode))
no member has a special role. Any member that is compatible with
the other group members is set to read/write mode when joining
the group, and can process write transactions, even if they are
issued concurrently.

If a member stops accepting write transactions, for example, in
the event of an unexpected server exit, clients connected to it
can be redirected, or failed over, to any other member that is
in read/write mode. Group Replication does not handle
client-side failover itself, so you need to arrange this using a
middleware framework such as [MySQL Router 8.0](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/mysql-router/8.0/en/), a
proxy, a connector, or the application itself.
[Figure 20.5, “Client Failover”](group-replication-multi-primary-mode.md#group-replication-multi-primary-diagram "Figure 20.5 Client Failover") shows
how clients can reconnect to an alternative group member if a
member leaves the group.

**Figure 20.5 Client Failover**

![Five server instances, S1, S2, S3, S4, and S5, are deployed as an interconnected group. All of the servers are primaries. Write clients are communicating with servers S1 and S2, and a read client is communicating with server S4. Server S1 then fails, breaking communication with its write client. This client reconnects to server S3.](images/multi-primary.png)

Group Replication is an eventual consistency system. This means
that as soon as the incoming traffic slows down or stops, all
group members have the same data content. While traffic is
flowing, transactions can be externalized on some members before
the others, especially if some members have less write
throughput than others, creating the possibility of stale reads.
In multi-primary mode, slower members can also build up an
excessive backlog of transactions to certify and apply, leading
to a greater risk of conflicts and certification failure. To
limit these issues, you can activate and tune Group
Replication's flow control mechanism to minimize the difference
between fast and slow members. For more information on flow
control, see [Section 20.7.2, “Flow Control”](group-replication-flow-control.md "20.7.2 Flow Control").

In MySQL 8.0.14 and later, if you want to have a transaction
consistency guarantee for every transaction in the group, you
can do this using the
[`group_replication_consistency`](group-replication-system-variables.md#sysvar_group_replication_consistency)
system variable. You can choose a setting that suits the
workload of your group and your priorities for data reads and
writes, taking into account the performance impact of the
synchronization required to increase consistency. You can also
set the system variable for individual sessions to protect
particularly concurrency-sensitive transactions. For more
information on transaction consistency, see
[Section 20.5.3, “Transaction Consistency Guarantees”](group-replication-consistency-guarantees.md "20.5.3 Transaction Consistency Guarantees").

##### 20.1.3.2.1 Transaction Checks

When a group is deployed in multi-primary mode, transactions
are checked to ensure they are compatible with the mode. The
following strict consistency checks are made when Group
Replication is deployed in multi-primary mode:

- If a transaction is executed under the SERIALIZABLE
  isolation level, then its commit fails when synchronizing
  itself with the group.
- If a transaction executes against a table that has foreign
  keys with cascading constraints, then its commit fails
  when synchronizing itself with the group.

The checks are controlled by the
[`group_replication_enforce_update_everywhere_checks`](group-replication-system-variables.md#sysvar_group_replication_enforce_update_everywhere_checks)
system variable. In multi-primary mode, the system variable
should normally be set to `ON`, but the
checks can optionally be deactivated by setting the system
variable to `OFF`. When deploying in
single-primary mode, the system variable must be set to
`OFF`.

##### 20.1.3.2.2 Data Definition Statements

In a Group Replication topology in multi-primary mode, care
needs to be taken when executing data definition statements,
also commonly known as data definition language (DDL).

MySQL 8.0 introduces support for atomic Data Definition
Language (DDL) statements, where the complete DDL statement is
either committed or rolled back as a single atomic
transaction. DDL statements, atomic or otherwise, implicitly
end any transaction that is active in the current session, as
if you had done a [`COMMIT`](commit.md "15.3.1 START TRANSACTION, COMMIT, and ROLLBACK Statements") before
executing the statement. This means that DDL statements cannot
be performed within another transaction, within transaction
control statements such as
[`START TRANSACTION ...
COMMIT`](commit.md "15.3.1 START TRANSACTION, COMMIT, and ROLLBACK Statements"), or combined with other statements within the
same transaction.

Group Replication is based on an optimistic replication
paradigm, where statements are optimistically executed and
rolled back later if necessary. Each server executes without
securing group agreement first. Therefore, more care needs to
be taken when replicating DDL statements in multi-primary
mode. If you make schema changes (using DDL) and changes to
the data that an object contains (using DML) for the same
object, the changes need to be handled through the same server
while the schema operation has not yet completed and
replicated everywhere. Failure to do so can result in data
inconsistency when operations are interrupted or only
partially completed. If the group is deployed in
single-primary mode this issue does not occur, because all
changes are performed through the same server, the primary.

For more information about atomic DDL support in MySQL 8.0,
and the resulting changes in behavior for the replication of
certain statements, see [Section 15.1.1, “Atomic Data Definition Statement Support”](atomic-ddl.md "15.1.1 Atomic Data Definition Statement Support").

##### 20.1.3.2.3 Version Compatibility

For optimal compatibility and performance, all members of a
group should run the same version of MySQL Server and
therefore of Group Replication. In multi-primary mode, this is
more significant because all members would normally join the
group in read/write mode. If a group includes members running
more than one MySQL Server version, there is a potential for
some members to be incompatible with others, because they
support functions others do not, or lack functions others
have. To guard against this, when a new member joins
(including a former member that has been upgraded and
restarted), the member carries out compatibility checks
against the rest of the group.

One result of these compatibility checks is particularly
important in multi-primary mode. If a joining member is
running a higher MySQL Server version than the lowest version
that the existing group members are running, it joins the
group but remains in read-only mode. (In a group that is
running in single-primary mode, new members default to
read-only in any case.) Members running MySQL 8.0.17 or later
take into account the patch version of the release when
checking their compatibility. Members running MySQL 8.0.16 or
ealrier, or MySQL 5.7, take into account the major version
only.

In a group running in multi-primary mode with members that use
different MySQL Server versions, Group Replication
automatically manages their read/write and read-only status.
If a member leaves the group, the members running the version
that is now the lowest are automatically set to read/write
mode. When you change a group that was running in
single-primary mode to run in multi-primary mode, using the
function
[`group_replication_switch_to_multi_primary_mode()`](group-replication-functions-for-mode.md#function_group-replication-switch-to-multi-primary-mode),
Group Replication automatically sets members to the correct
mode. Members are automatically placed in read-only mode if
they are running a higher MySQL server version than the lowest
version present in the group, and members running the lowest
version are placed in read/write mode.

For full information on version compatibility in a group and
how this influences the behavior of a group during an upgrade
process, see
