### 10.3.8 InnoDB and MyISAM Index Statistics Collection

Storage engines collect statistics about tables for use by the
optimizer. Table statistics are based on value groups, where a
value group is a set of rows with the same key prefix value. For
optimizer purposes, an important statistic is the average value
group size.

MySQL uses the average value group size in the following ways:

- To estimate how many rows must be read for each
  [`ref`](explain-output.md#jointype_ref) access
- To estimate how many rows a partial join produces, that is,
  the number of rows produced by an operation of the form

  ```sql
  (...) JOIN tbl_name ON tbl_name.key = expr
  ```

As the average value group size for an index increases, the
index is less useful for those two purposes because the average
number of rows per lookup increases: For the index to be good
for optimization purposes, it is best that each index value
target a small number of rows in the table. When a given index
value yields a large number of rows, the index is less useful
and MySQL is less likely to use it.

The average value group size is related to table cardinality,
which is the number of value groups. The
[`SHOW INDEX`](show-index.md "15.7.7.22 SHOW INDEX Statement") statement displays a
cardinality value based on *`N/S`*, where
*`N`* is the number of rows in the table
and *`S`* is the average value group
size. That ratio yields an approximate number of value groups in
the table.

For a join based on the `<=>` comparison
operator, `NULL` is not treated differently
from any other value: `NULL <=> NULL`,
just as `N <=>
N` for any other
*`N`*.

However, for a join based on the `=` operator,
`NULL` is different from
non-`NULL` values:
`expr1 =
expr2` is not true when
*`expr1`* or
*`expr2`* (or both) are
`NULL`. This affects
[`ref`](explain-output.md#jointype_ref) accesses for comparisons
of the form `tbl_name.key =
expr`: MySQL does not access
the table if the current value of
*`expr`* is `NULL`,
because the comparison cannot be true.

For `=` comparisons, it does not matter how
many `NULL` values are in the table. For
optimization purposes, the relevant value is the average size of
the non-`NULL` value groups. However, MySQL
does not currently enable that average size to be collected or
used.

For `InnoDB` and `MyISAM`
tables, you have some control over collection of table
statistics by means of the
[`innodb_stats_method`](innodb-parameters.md#sysvar_innodb_stats_method) and
[`myisam_stats_method`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_myisam_stats_method) system
variables, respectively. These variables have three possible
values, which differ as follows:

- When the variable is set to `nulls_equal`,
  all `NULL` values are treated as identical
  (that is, they all form a single value group).

  If the `NULL` value group size is much
  higher than the average non-`NULL` value
  group size, this method skews the average value group size
  upward. This makes index appear to the optimizer to be less
  useful than it really is for joins that look for
  non-`NULL` values. Consequently, the
  `nulls_equal` method may cause the
  optimizer not to use the index for
  [`ref`](explain-output.md#jointype_ref) accesses when it
  should.
- When the variable is set to
  `nulls_unequal`, `NULL`
  values are not considered the same. Instead, each
  `NULL` value forms a separate value group
  of size 1.

  If you have many `NULL` values, this method
  skews the average value group size downward. If the average
  non-`NULL` value group size is large,
  counting `NULL` values each as a group of
  size 1 causes the optimizer to overestimate the value of the
  index for joins that look for non-`NULL`
  values. Consequently, the `nulls_unequal`
  method may cause the optimizer to use this index for
  [`ref`](explain-output.md#jointype_ref) lookups when other
  methods may be better.
- When the variable is set to
  `nulls_ignored`, `NULL`
  values are ignored.

If you tend to use many joins that use
`<=>` rather than `=`,
`NULL` values are not special in comparisons
and one `NULL` is equal to another. In this
case, `nulls_equal` is the appropriate
statistics method.

The [`innodb_stats_method`](innodb-parameters.md#sysvar_innodb_stats_method) system
variable has a global value; the
[`myisam_stats_method`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_myisam_stats_method) system
variable has both global and session values. Setting the global
value affects statistics collection for tables from the
corresponding storage engine. Setting the session value affects
statistics collection only for the current client connection.
This means that you can force a table's statistics to be
regenerated with a given method without affecting other clients
by setting the session value of
[`myisam_stats_method`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_myisam_stats_method).

To regenerate `MyISAM` table statistics, you
can use any of the following methods:

- Execute [**myisamchk
  --stats\_method=*`method_name`*
  --analyze**](myisamchk.md "6.6.4 myisamchk — MyISAM Table-Maintenance Utility")
- Change the table to cause its statistics to go out of date
  (for example, insert a row and then delete it), and then set
  [`myisam_stats_method`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_myisam_stats_method) and
  issue an [`ANALYZE TABLE`](analyze-table.md "15.7.3.1 ANALYZE TABLE Statement")
  statement

Some caveats regarding the use of
[`innodb_stats_method`](innodb-parameters.md#sysvar_innodb_stats_method) and
[`myisam_stats_method`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_myisam_stats_method):

- You can force table statistics to be collected explicitly,
  as just described. However, MySQL may also collect
  statistics automatically. For example, if during the course
  of executing statements for a table, some of those
  statements modify the table, MySQL may collect statistics.
  (This may occur for bulk inserts or deletes, or some
  [`ALTER TABLE`](alter-table.md "15.1.9 ALTER TABLE Statement") statements, for
  example.) If this happens, the statistics are collected
  using whatever value
  [`innodb_stats_method`](innodb-parameters.md#sysvar_innodb_stats_method) or
  [`myisam_stats_method`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_myisam_stats_method) has at
  the time. Thus, if you collect statistics using one method,
  but the system variable is set to the other method when a
  table's statistics are collected automatically later,
  the other method is used.
- There is no way to tell which method was used to generate
  statistics for a given table.
- These variables apply only to `InnoDB` and
  `MyISAM` tables. Other storage engines have
  only one method for collecting table statistics. Usually it
  is closer to the `nulls_equal` method.
