### 27.4.5 Event Scheduler Status

The Event Scheduler writes information about event execution that
terminates with an error or warning to the MySQL Server's error
log. See [Section 27.4.6, “The Event Scheduler and MySQL Privileges”](events-privileges.md "27.4.6 The Event Scheduler and MySQL Privileges") for an example.

To obtain information about the state of the Event Scheduler for
debugging and troubleshooting purposes, run [**mysqladmin
debug**](mysqladmin.md "6.5.2 mysqladmin — A MySQL Server Administration Program") (see [Section 6.5.2, “mysqladmin — A MySQL Server Administration Program”](mysqladmin.md "6.5.2 mysqladmin — A MySQL Server Administration Program")); after running
this command, the server's error log contains output relating to
the Event Scheduler, similar to what is shown here:

```none
Events status:
LLA = Last Locked At  LUA = Last Unlocked At
WOC = Waiting On Condition  DL = Data Locked

Event scheduler status:
State      : INITIALIZED
Thread id  : 0
LLA        : n/a:0
LUA        : n/a:0
WOC        : NO
Workers    : 0
Executed   : 0
Data locked: NO

Event queue status:
Element count   : 0
Data locked     : NO
Attempting lock : NO
LLA             : init_queue:95
LUA             : init_queue:103
WOC             : NO
Next activation : never
```

In statements that occur as part of events executed by the Event
Scheduler, diagnostics messages (not only errors, but also
warnings) are written to the error log, and, on Windows, to the
application event log. For frequently executed events, it is
possible for this to result in many logged messages. For example,
for `SELECT ... INTO
var_list` statements, if the
query returns no rows, a warning with error code 1329 occurs
(`No data`), and the variable values remain
unchanged. If the query returns multiple rows, error 1172 occurs
(`Result consisted of more than one row`). For
either condition, you can avoid having the warnings be logged by
declaring a condition handler; see
[Section 15.6.7.2, “DECLARE ... HANDLER Statement”](declare-handler.md "15.6.7.2 DECLARE ... HANDLER Statement"). For statements that may
retrieve multiple rows, another strategy is to use `LIMIT
1` to limit the result set to a single row.
