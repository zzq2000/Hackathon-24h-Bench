#### 19.1.3.4 Setting Up Replication Using GTIDs

This section describes a process for configuring and starting
GTID-based replication in MySQL 8.0. This is a
“cold start” procedure that assumes either that you
are starting the source server for the first time, or that it is
possible to stop it; for information about provisioning replicas
using GTIDs from a running source server, see
[Section 19.1.3.5, “Using GTIDs for Failover and Scaleout”](replication-gtids-failover.md "19.1.3.5 Using GTIDs for Failover and Scaleout"). For information
about changing GTID mode on servers online, see
[Section 19.1.4, “Changing GTID Mode on Online Servers”](replication-mode-change-online.md "19.1.4 Changing GTID Mode on Online Servers").

The key steps in this startup process for the simplest possible
GTID replication topology, consisting of one source and one
replica, are as follows:

1. If replication is already running, synchronize both servers by
   making them read-only.
2. Stop both servers.
3. Restart both servers with GTIDs enabled and the correct
   options configured.

   The [**mysqld**](mysqld.md "6.3.1 mysqld — The MySQL Server") options necessary to start the
   servers as described are discussed in the example that follows
   later in this section.
4. Instruct the replica to use the source as the replication data
   source and to use auto-positioning. The SQL statements needed
   to accomplish this step are described in the example that
   follows later in this section.
5. Take a new backup. Binary logs containing transactions without
   GTIDs cannot be used on servers where GTIDs are enabled, so
   backups taken before this point cannot be used with your new
   configuration.
6. Start the replica, then disable read-only mode on both
   servers, so that they can accept updates.

In the following example, two servers are already running as
source and replica, using MySQL's binary log position-based
replication protocol. If you are starting with new servers, see
[Section 19.1.2.3, “Creating a User for Replication”](replication-howto-repuser.md "19.1.2.3 Creating a User for Replication") for information about
adding a specific user for replication connections and
[Section 19.1.2.1, “Setting the Replication Source Configuration”](replication-howto-masterbaseconfig.md "19.1.2.1 Setting the Replication Source Configuration") for
information about setting the
[`server_id`](replication-options.md#sysvar_server_id) variable. The following
examples show how to store [**mysqld**](mysqld.md "6.3.1 mysqld — The MySQL Server") startup
options in server's option file, see
[Section 6.2.2.2, “Using Option Files”](option-files.md "6.2.2.2 Using Option Files") for more information. Alternatively
you can use startup options when running
[**mysqld**](mysqld.md "6.3.1 mysqld — The MySQL Server").

Most of the steps that follow require the use of the MySQL
`root` account or another MySQL user account that
has the [`SUPER`](privileges-provided.md#priv_super) privilege.
[**mysqladmin**](mysqladmin.md "6.5.2 mysqladmin — A MySQL Server Administration Program") `shutdown` requires
either the `SUPER` privilege or the
[`SHUTDOWN`](privileges-provided.md#priv_shutdown) privilege.

**Step 1: Synchronize the servers.**
This step is only required when working with servers which are
already replicating without using GTIDs. For new servers proceed
to Step 3. Make the servers read-only by setting the
[`read_only`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_read_only) system variable to
`ON` on each server by issuing the following:

```sql
mysql> SET @@GLOBAL.read_only = ON;
```

Wait for all ongoing transactions to commit or roll back. Then,
allow the replica to catch up with the source. *It is
extremely important that you make sure the replica has processed
all updates before continuing*.

If you use binary logs for anything other than replication, for
example to do point in time backup and restore, wait until you do
not need the old binary logs containing transactions without
GTIDs. Ideally, wait for the server to purge all binary logs, and
wait for any existing backup to expire.

Important

It is important to understand that logs containing transactions
without GTIDs cannot be used on servers where GTIDs are enabled.
Before proceeding, you must be sure that transactions without
GTIDs do not exist anywhere in the topology.

**Step 2: Stop both servers.**
Stop each server using [**mysqladmin**](mysqladmin.md "6.5.2 mysqladmin — A MySQL Server Administration Program") as shown
here, where *`username`* is the user name
for a MySQL user having sufficient privileges to shut down the
server:

```terminal
$> mysqladmin -uusername -p shutdown
```

Then supply this user's password at the prompt.

**Step 3: Start both servers with GTIDs enabled.**
To enable GTID-based replication, each server must be started
with GTID mode enabled by setting the
[`gtid_mode`](replication-options-gtids.md#sysvar_gtid_mode) variable to
`ON`, and with the
[`enforce_gtid_consistency`](replication-options-gtids.md#sysvar_enforce_gtid_consistency)
variable enabled to ensure that only statements which are safe
for GTID-based replication are logged. For example:

```ini
gtid_mode=ON
enforce-gtid-consistency=ON
```

Start each replica with the
[`--skip-slave-start`](replication-options-replica.md#option_mysqld_skip-slave-start) option, or from
MySQL 8.0.24, the
[`skip_slave_start`](replication-options-replica.md#sysvar_skip_slave_start) system variable,
to ensure that replication does not start until you have
configured the replica settings. From MySQL 8.0.26, use
[`--skip-replica-start`](replication-options-replica.md#option_mysqld_skip-replica-start) or
[`skip_replica_start`](replication-options-replica.md#sysvar_skip_replica_start) instead. For
more information on GTID related options and variables, see
[Section 19.1.6.5, “Global Transaction ID System Variables”](replication-options-gtids.md "19.1.6.5 Global Transaction ID System Variables").

It is not mandatory to have binary logging enabled in order to use
GTIDs when using the
[mysql.gtid\_executed Table](replication-gtids-concepts.md#replication-gtids-gtid-executed-table "mysql.gtid_executed Table"). Source
servers must always have binary logging enabled in order to be
able to replicate. However, replica servers can use GTIDs but
without binary logging. If you need to disable binary logging on a
replica server, you can do this by specifying the
[`--skip-log-bin`](replication-options-binary-log.md#option_mysqld_log-bin)
and [`--log-replica-updates=OFF`](replication-options-binary-log.md#sysvar_log_replica_updates) or
[`--log-slave-updates=OFF`](replication-options-binary-log.md#sysvar_log_slave_updates) options for
the replica.

**Step 4: Configure the replica to use GTID-based auto-positioning.**
Tell the replica to use the source with GTID based transactions
as the replication data source, and to use GTID-based
auto-positioning rather than file-based positioning. Issue a
[`CHANGE REPLICATION SOURCE TO`](change-replication-source-to.md "15.4.2.3 CHANGE REPLICATION SOURCE TO Statement")
statement (from MySQL 8.0.23) or [`CHANGE
MASTER TO`](change-master-to.md "15.4.2.1 CHANGE MASTER TO Statement") statement (before MySQL 8.0.23) on the
replica, including the `SOURCE_AUTO_POSITION` |
`MASTER_AUTO_POSITION` option in the statement
to tell the replica that the source's transactions are
identified by GTIDs.

You may also need to supply appropriate values for the
source's host name and port number as well as the user name
and password for a replication user account which can be used by
the replica to connect to the source; if these have already been
set prior to Step 1 and no further changes need to be made, the
corresponding options can safely be omitted from the statement
shown here.

```sql
mysql> CHANGE MASTER TO
     >     MASTER_HOST = host,
     >     MASTER_PORT = port,
     >     MASTER_USER = user,
     >     MASTER_PASSWORD = password,
     >     MASTER_AUTO_POSITION = 1;

Or from MySQL 8.0.23:

mysql> CHANGE REPLICATION SOURCE TO
     >     SOURCE_HOST = host,
     >     SOURCE_PORT = port,
     >     SOURCE_USER = user,
     >     SOURCE_PASSWORD = password,
     >     SOURCE_AUTO_POSITION = 1;
```

**Step 5: Take a new backup.**
Existing backups that were made before you enabled GTIDs can no
longer be used on these servers now that you have enabled GTIDs.
Take a new backup at this point, so that you are not left
without a usable backup.

For instance, you can execute [`FLUSH
LOGS`](flush.md#flush-logs) on the server where you are taking backups. Then
either explicitly take a backup or wait for the next iteration of
any periodic backup routine you may have set up.

**Step 6: Start the replica and disable read-only mode.**
Start the replica like this:

```sql
mysql> START SLAVE;
Or from MySQL 8.0.22:
mysql> START REPLICA;
```

The following step is only necessary if you configured a server to
be read-only in Step 1. To allow the server to begin accepting
updates again, issue the following statement:

```sql
mysql> SET @@GLOBAL.read_only = OFF;
```

GTID-based replication should now be running, and you can begin
(or resume) activity on the source as before.
[Section 19.1.3.5, “Using GTIDs for Failover and Scaleout”](replication-gtids-failover.md "19.1.3.5 Using GTIDs for Failover and Scaleout"), discusses creation
of new replicas when using GTIDs.
