## 17.13 InnoDB Data-at-Rest Encryption

`InnoDB` supports data-at-rest encryption for
[file-per-table](glossary.md#glos_file_per_table "file-per-table")
tablespaces, [general](glossary.md#glos_general_tablespace "general tablespace")
tablespaces, the `mysql` system tablespace, redo
logs, and undo logs.

As of MySQL 8.0.16, setting an encryption default for schemas and
general tablespaces is also supported, which permits DBAs to control
whether tables created in those schemas and tablespaces are
encrypted.

`InnoDB` data-at-rest encryption features and
capabilities are described under the following topics in this
section.

### About Data-at-Rest Encryption

`InnoDB` uses a two tier encryption key
architecture, consisting of a master encryption key and tablespace
keys. When a tablespace is encrypted, a tablespace key is
encrypted and stored in the tablespace header. When an application
or authenticated user wants to access encrypted tablespace data,
`InnoDB` uses a master encryption key to decrypt
the tablespace key. The decrypted version of a tablespace key
never changes, but the master encryption key can be changed as
required. This action is referred to as *master key
rotation*.

The data-at-rest encryption feature relies on a keyring component
or plugin for master encryption key management.

All MySQL editions provide a
`component_keyring_file` component and
`keyring_file` plugin, each of which stores
keyring data in a file local to the server host.

MySQL Enterprise Edition offers additional keyring components and plugins:

- `component_keyring_encrypted_file`: Stores
  keyring data in an encrypted, password-protected file local to
  the server host.
- `keyring_encrypted_file`: Stores keyring data
  in an encrypted, password-protected file local to the server
  host.
- `keyring_okv`: A KMIP 1.1 plugin for use with
  KMIP-compatible back end keyring storage products. Supported
  KMIP-compatible products include centralized key management
  solutions such as Oracle Key Vault, Gemalto KeySecure, Thales
  Vormetric key management server, and Fornetix Key
  Orchestration.
- `keyring_aws`: Communicates with the Amazon
  Web Services Key Management Service (AWS KMS) as a back end
  for key generation and uses a local file for key storage.
- `keyring_hashicorp`: Communicates with
  HashiCorp Vault for back end storage.

Warning

For encryption key management, the
`component_keyring_file` and
`component_keyring_encrypted_file` components,
and the `keyring_file` and
`keyring_encrypted_file` plugins are not
intended as a regulatory compliance solution. Security standards
such as PCI, FIPS, and others require use of key management
systems to secure, manage, and protect encryption keys in key
vaults or hardware security modules (HSMs).

A secure and robust encryption key management solution is critical
for security and for compliance with various security standards.
When the data-at-rest encryption feature uses a centralized key
management solution, the feature is referred to as “MySQL
Enterprise Transparent Data Encryption (TDE)”.

The data-at-rest encryption feature supports the Advanced
Encryption Standard (AES) block-based encryption algorithm. It
uses Electronic Codebook (ECB) block encryption mode for
tablespace key encryption and Cipher Block Chaining (CBC) block
encryption mode for data encryption.

For frequently asked questions about the data-at-rest encryption
feature, see [Section A.17, “MySQL 8.0 FAQ: InnoDB Data-at-Rest Encryption”](faqs-tablespace-encryption.md "A.17 MySQL 8.0 FAQ: InnoDB Data-at-Rest Encryption").

### Encryption Prerequisites

- A keyring component or plugin must be installed and configured
  at startup. Early loading ensures that the component or plugin
  is available prior to initialization of the
  `InnoDB` storage engine. For keyring
  installation and configuration instructions, see
  [Section 8.4.4, “The MySQL Keyring”](keyring.md "8.4.4 The MySQL Keyring"). The instructions show how to ensure
  that the chosen component or plugin is active.

  Only one keyring component or plugin should be enabled at a
  time. Enabling multiple keyring components or plugins is
  unsupported and results may not be as anticipated.

  Important

  Once encrypted tablespaces are created in a MySQL instance,
  the keyring component or plugin that was loaded when
  creating the encrypted tablespace must continue to be loaded
  at startup. Failing to do so results in errors when starting
  the server and during `InnoDB` recovery.
- When encrypting production data, ensure that you take steps to
  prevent loss of the master encryption key. *If the
  master encryption key is lost, data stored in encrypted
  tablespace files is unrecoverable.* If you use the
  `component_keyring_file` or
  `component_keyring_encrypted_file` component,
  or the `keyring_file` or
  `keyring_encrypted_file` plugin, create a
  backup of the keyring data file immediately after creating the
  first encrypted tablespace, before master key rotation, and
  after master key rotation. For each component, its
  configuration file indicates the data file location. The
  [`keyring_file_data`](keyring-system-variables.md#sysvar_keyring_file_data)
  configuration option defines the keyring data file location
  for the `keyring_file` plugin. The
  [`keyring_encrypted_file_data`](keyring-system-variables.md#sysvar_keyring_encrypted_file_data)
  configuration option defines the keyring data file location
  for the `keyring_encrypted_file` plugin. If
  you use the `keyring_okv` or
  `keyring_aws` plugin, ensure that you have
  performed the necessary configuration. For instructions, see
  [Section 8.4.4, “The MySQL Keyring”](keyring.md "8.4.4 The MySQL Keyring").

### Defining an Encryption Default for Schemas and General Tablespaces

As of MySQL 8.0.16, the
[`default_table_encryption`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_default_table_encryption) system
variable defines the default encryption setting for schemas and
general tablespaces. [`CREATE
TABLESPACE`](create-tablespace.md "15.1.21 CREATE TABLESPACE Statement") and
[`CREATE
SCHEMA`](create-database.md "15.1.12 CREATE DATABASE Statement") operations apply the
[`default_table_encryption`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_default_table_encryption) setting
when an `ENCRYPTION` clause is not specified
explicitly.

[`ALTER
SCHEMA`](alter-database.md "15.1.2 ALTER DATABASE Statement") and [`ALTER
TABLESPACE`](alter-tablespace.md "15.1.10 ALTER TABLESPACE Statement") operations do not apply the
[`default_table_encryption`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_default_table_encryption) setting.
An `ENCRYPTION` clause must be specified
explicitly to alter the encryption of an existing schema or
general tablespace.

The [`default_table_encryption`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_default_table_encryption)
variable can be set for an individual client connection or
globally using
[`SET`](set-variable.md "15.7.6.1 SET Syntax for Variable Assignment")
syntax. For example, the following statement enables default
schema and tablespace encryption globally:

```sql
mysql> SET GLOBAL default_table_encryption=ON;
```

The default encryption setting for a schema can also be defined
using the `DEFAULT ENCRYPTION` clause when
creating or altering a schema, as in this example:

```sql
mysql> CREATE SCHEMA test DEFAULT ENCRYPTION = 'Y';
```

If the `DEFAULT ENCRYPTION` clause is not
specified when creating a schema, the
[`default_table_encryption`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_default_table_encryption) setting
is applied. The `DEFAULT ENCRYPTION` clause must
be specified to alter the default encryption of an existing
schema. Otherwise, the schema retains its current encryption
setting.

By default, a table inherits the encryption setting of the schema
or general tablespace it is created in. For example, a table
created in an encryption-enabled schema is encrypted by default.
This behavior enables a DBA to control table encryption usage by
defining and enforcing schema and general tablespace encryption
defaults.

Encryption defaults are enforced by enabling the
[`table_encryption_privilege_check`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_table_encryption_privilege_check)
system variable. When
[`table_encryption_privilege_check`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_table_encryption_privilege_check)
is enabled, a privilege check occurs when creating or altering a
schema or general tablespace with an encryption setting that
differs from the
[`default_table_encryption`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_default_table_encryption) setting,
or when creating or altering a table with an encryption setting
that differs from the default schema encryption. When
[`table_encryption_privilege_check`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_table_encryption_privilege_check)
is disabled (the default), the privilege check does not occur and
the previously mentioned operations are permitted to proceed with
a warning.

The [`TABLE_ENCRYPTION_ADMIN`](privileges-provided.md#priv_table-encryption-admin)
privilege is required to override default encryption settings when
[`table_encryption_privilege_check`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_table_encryption_privilege_check)
is enabled. A DBA can grant this privilege to enable a user to
deviate from the
[`default_table_encryption`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_default_table_encryption) setting
when creating or altering a schema or general tablespace, or to
deviate from the default schema encryption when creating or
altering a table. This privilege does not permit deviating from
the encryption of a general tablespace when creating or altering a
table. A table must have the same encryption setting as the
general tablespace it resides in.

### File-Per-Table Tablespace Encryption

As of MySQL 8.0.16, a file-per-table tablespace inherits the
default encryption of the schema in which the table is created
unless an `ENCRYPTION` clause is specified
explicitly in the [`CREATE TABLE`](create-table.md "15.1.20 CREATE TABLE Statement")
statement. Prior to MySQL 8.0.16, the
`ENCRYPTION` clause must be specified to enable
encryption.

```sql
mysql> CREATE TABLE t1 (c1 INT) ENCRYPTION = 'Y';
```

To alter the encryption of an existing file-per-table tablespace,
an `ENCRYPTION` clause must be specified.

```sql
mysql> ALTER TABLE t1 ENCRYPTION = 'Y';
```

As of MySQL 8.0.16, if the
[`table_encryption_privilege_check`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_table_encryption_privilege_check)
variable is enabled, specifying an `ENCRYPTION`
clause with a setting that differs from the default schema
encryption requires the
[`TABLE_ENCRYPTION_ADMIN`](privileges-provided.md#priv_table-encryption-admin) privilege.
See [Defining an Encryption Default for Schemas and General Tablespaces](innodb-data-encryption.md#innodb-schema-tablespace-encryption-default "Defining an Encryption Default for Schemas and General Tablespaces").

### General Tablespace Encryption

As of MySQL 8.0.16, the
[`default_table_encryption`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_default_table_encryption) variable
determines the encryption of a newly created general tablespace
unless an `ENCRYPTION` clause is specified
explicitly in the [`CREATE TABLESPACE`](create-tablespace.md "15.1.21 CREATE TABLESPACE Statement")
statement. Prior to MySQL 8.0.16, an `ENCRYPTION`
clause must be specified to enable encryption.

```sql
mysql> CREATE TABLESPACE `ts1` ADD DATAFILE 'ts1.ibd' ENCRYPTION = 'Y' Engine=InnoDB;
```

To alter the encryption of an existing general tablespace, an
`ENCRYPTION` clause must be specified.

```sql
mysql> ALTER TABLESPACE ts1 ENCRYPTION = 'Y';
```

As of MySQL 8.0.16, if the
[`table_encryption_privilege_check`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_table_encryption_privilege_check)
variable is enabled, specifying an `ENCRYPTION`
clause with a setting that differs from the
[`default_table_encryption`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_default_table_encryption) setting
requires the [`TABLE_ENCRYPTION_ADMIN`](privileges-provided.md#priv_table-encryption-admin)
privilege. See
[Defining an Encryption Default for Schemas and General Tablespaces](innodb-data-encryption.md#innodb-schema-tablespace-encryption-default "Defining an Encryption Default for Schemas and General Tablespaces").

### Doublewrite File Encryption

Encryption support for doublewrite files is available as of MySQL
8.0.23. `InnoDB` automatically encrypts
doublewrite file pages that belong to encrypted tablespaces. No
action is required. Doublewrite file pages are encrypted using the
encryption key of the associated tablespace. The same encrypted
page written to a tablespace data file is also written to a
doublewrite file. Doublewrite file pages that belong to an
unencrypted tablespace remain unencrypted.

During recovery, encrypted doublewrite file pages are unencrypted
and checked for corruption.

### mysql System Tablespace Encryption

Encryption support for the `mysql` system
tablespace is available as of MySQL 8.0.16.

The `mysql` system tablespace contains the
`mysql` system database and MySQL data dictionary
tables. It is unencrypted by default. To enable encryption for the
`mysql` system tablespace, specify the tablespace
name and the `ENCRYPTION` option in an
[`ALTER TABLESPACE`](alter-tablespace.md "15.1.10 ALTER TABLESPACE Statement") statement.

```sql
mysql> ALTER TABLESPACE mysql ENCRYPTION = 'Y';
```

To disable encryption for the `mysql` system
tablespace, set `ENCRYPTION = 'N'` using an
[`ALTER TABLESPACE`](alter-tablespace.md "15.1.10 ALTER TABLESPACE Statement") statement.

```sql
mysql> ALTER TABLESPACE mysql ENCRYPTION = 'N';
```

Enabling or disabling encryption for the `mysql`
system tablespace requires the [`CREATE
TABLESPACE`](privileges-provided.md#priv_create-tablespace) privilege on all tables in the instance
(`CREATE TABLESPACE on *.*)`.

### Redo Log Encryption

Redo log data encryption is enabled using the
[`innodb_redo_log_encrypt`](innodb-parameters.md#sysvar_innodb_redo_log_encrypt)
configuration option. Redo log encryption is disabled by default.

As with tablespace data, redo log data encryption occurs when redo
log data is written to disk, and decryption occurs when redo log
data is read from disk. Once redo log data is read into memory, it
is in unencrypted form. Redo log data is encrypted and decrypted
using the tablespace encryption key.

When [`innodb_redo_log_encrypt`](innodb-parameters.md#sysvar_innodb_redo_log_encrypt) is
enabled, unencrypted redo log pages that are present on disk
remain unencrypted, and new redo log pages are written to disk in
encrypted form. Likewise, when
[`innodb_redo_log_encrypt`](innodb-parameters.md#sysvar_innodb_redo_log_encrypt) is
disabled, encrypted redo log pages that are present on disk remain
encrypted, and new redo log pages are written to disk in
unencrypted form.

From MySQL 8.0.30, redo log encryption metadata, including the
tablespace encryption key, is stored in the header of the redo log
file with the most recent checkpoint LSN. Before MySQL 8.0.30,
redo log encryption metadata, including the tablespace encryption
key, is stored in the header of the first redo log file
(`ib_logfile0`). If the redo log file with the
encryption metadata is removed, redo log encryption is disabled.

Once redo log encryption is enabled, a normal restart without the
keyring component or plugin or without the encryption key is not
possible, as `InnoDB` must be able to scan redo
pages during startup, which is not possible if redo log pages are
encrypted. Without the keyring component or plugin or the
encryption key, only a forced startup without the redo logs
(`SRV_FORCE_NO_LOG_REDO`) is possible. See
[Section 17.21.3, “Forcing InnoDB Recovery”](forcing-innodb-recovery.md "17.21.3 Forcing InnoDB Recovery").

### Undo Log Encryption

Undo log data encryption is enabled using the
[`innodb_undo_log_encrypt`](innodb-parameters.md#sysvar_innodb_undo_log_encrypt)
configuration option. Undo log encryption applies to undo logs
that reside in [undo
tablespaces](glossary.md#glos_undo_tablespace "undo tablespace"). See [Section 17.6.3.4, “Undo Tablespaces”](innodb-undo-tablespaces.md "17.6.3.4 Undo Tablespaces").
Undo log data encryption is disabled by default.

As with tablespace data, undo log data encryption occurs when undo
log data is written to disk, and decryption occurs when undo log
data is read from disk. Once undo log data is read into memory, it
is in unencrypted form. Undo log data is encrypted and decrypted
using the tablespace encryption key.

When [`innodb_undo_log_encrypt`](innodb-parameters.md#sysvar_innodb_undo_log_encrypt) is
enabled, unencrypted undo log pages that are present on disk
remain unencrypted, and new undo log pages are written to disk in
encrypted form. Likewise, when
[`innodb_undo_log_encrypt`](innodb-parameters.md#sysvar_innodb_undo_log_encrypt) is
disabled, encrypted undo log pages that are present on disk remain
encrypted, and new undo log pages are written to disk in
unencrypted form.

Undo log encryption metadata, including the tablespace encryption
key, is stored in the header of the undo log file.

Note

When undo log encryption is disabled, the server continues to
require the keyring component or plugin that was used to encrypt
undo log data until the undo tablespaces that contained the
encrypted undo log data are truncated. (An encryption header is
only removed from an undo tablespace when the undo tablespace is
truncated.) For information about truncating undo tablespaces,
see [Truncating Undo Tablespaces](innodb-undo-tablespaces.md#truncate-undo-tablespace "Truncating Undo Tablespaces").

### Master Key Rotation

The master encryption key should be rotated periodically and
whenever you suspect that the key has been compromised.

Master key rotation is an atomic, instance-level operation. Each
time the master encryption key is rotated, all tablespace keys in
the MySQL instance are re-encrypted and saved back to their
respective tablespace headers. As an atomic operation,
re-encryption must succeed for all tablespace keys once a rotation
operation is initiated. If master key rotation is interrupted by a
server failure, `InnoDB` rolls the operation
forward on server restart. For more information, see
[Encryption and Recovery](innodb-data-encryption.md#innodb-data-encryption-recovery "Encryption and Recovery").

Rotating the master encryption key only changes the master
encryption key and re-encrypts tablespace keys. It does not
decrypt or re-encrypt associated tablespace data.

Rotating the master encryption key requires the
[`ENCRYPTION_KEY_ADMIN`](privileges-provided.md#priv_encryption-key-admin) privilege (or
the deprecated [`SUPER`](privileges-provided.md#priv_super) privilege).

To rotate the master encryption key, run:

```sql
mysql> ALTER INSTANCE ROTATE INNODB MASTER KEY;
```

[`ALTER INSTANCE ROTATE INNODB MASTER
KEY`](alter-instance.md#alter-instance-rotate-innodb-master-key) supports concurrent DML. However, it cannot be run
concurrently with tablespace encryption operations, and locks are
taken to prevent conflicts that could arise from concurrent
execution. If an [`ALTER INSTANCE ROTATE INNODB
MASTER KEY`](alter-instance.md#alter-instance-rotate-innodb-master-key) operation is running, it must finish before a
tablespace encryption operation can proceed, and vice versa.

### Encryption and Recovery

If a server failure occurs during an encryption operation, the
operation is rolled forward when the server is restarted. For
general tablespaces, the encryption operation is resumed in a
background thread from the last processed page.

If a server failure occurs during master key rotation,
`InnoDB` continues the operation on server
restart.

The keyring component or plugin must be loaded prior to storage
engine initialization so that the information necessary to decrypt
tablespace data pages can be retrieved from tablespace headers
before `InnoDB` initialization and recovery
activities access tablespace data. (See
[Encryption Prerequisites](innodb-data-encryption.md#innodb-data-encryption-encryption-prerequisites "Encryption Prerequisites").)

When `InnoDB` initialization and recovery begin,
the master key rotation operation resumes. Due to the server
failure, some tablespace keys may already be encrypted using the
new master encryption key. `InnoDB` reads the
encryption data from each tablespace header, and if the data
indicates that the tablespace key is encrypted using the old
master encryption key, `InnoDB` retrieves the old
key from the keyring and uses it to decrypt the tablespace key.
`InnoDB` then re-encrypts the tablespace key
using the new master encryption key and saves the re-encrypted
tablespace key back to the tablespace header.

### Exporting Encrypted Tablespaces

Tablespace export is only supported for file-per-table
tablespaces.

When an encrypted tablespace is exported,
`InnoDB` generates a *transfer
key* that is used to encrypt the tablespace key. The
encrypted tablespace key and transfer key are stored in a
`tablespace_name.cfp`
file. This file together with the encrypted tablespace file is
required to perform an import operation. On import,
`InnoDB` uses the transfer key to decrypt the
tablespace key in the
`tablespace_name.cfp`
file. For related information, see
[Section 17.6.1.3, “Importing InnoDB Tables”](innodb-table-import.md "17.6.1.3 Importing InnoDB Tables").

### Encryption and Replication

- The [`ALTER INSTANCE ROTATE INNODB MASTER
  KEY`](alter-instance.md#alter-instance-rotate-innodb-master-key) statement is only supported in replication
  environments where the source and replica run a version of
  MySQL that supports tablespace encryption.
- Successful [`ALTER INSTANCE ROTATE INNODB
  MASTER KEY`](alter-instance.md#alter-instance-rotate-innodb-master-key) statements are written to the binary log
  for replication on replicas.
- If an [`ALTER INSTANCE ROTATE INNODB MASTER
  KEY`](alter-instance.md#alter-instance-rotate-innodb-master-key) statement fails, it is not logged to the binary
  log and is not replicated on replicas.
- Replication of an [`ALTER INSTANCE ROTATE
  INNODB MASTER KEY`](alter-instance.md#alter-instance-rotate-innodb-master-key) operation fails if the keyring
  component or plugin is installed on the source but not on the
  replica.
- If the `keyring_file` or
  `keyring_encrypted_file` plugin is installed
  on both the source and a replica but the replica does not have
  a keyring data file, the replicated [`ALTER
  INSTANCE ROTATE INNODB MASTER KEY`](alter-instance.md#alter-instance-rotate-innodb-master-key) statement creates
  the keyring data file on the replica, assuming the keyring
  file data is not cached in memory. [`ALTER
  INSTANCE ROTATE INNODB MASTER KEY`](alter-instance.md#alter-instance-rotate-innodb-master-key) uses keyring file
  data that is cached in memory, if available.

### Identifying Encrypted Tablespaces and Schemas

The Information Schema
[`INNODB_TABLESPACES`](information-schema-innodb-tablespaces-table.md "28.4.24 The INFORMATION_SCHEMA INNODB_TABLESPACES Table") table, introduced
in MySQL 8.0.13, includes an `ENCRYPTION` column
that can be used to identify encrypted tablespaces.

```sql
mysql> SELECT SPACE, NAME, SPACE_TYPE, ENCRYPTION FROM INFORMATION_SCHEMA.INNODB_TABLESPACES
       WHERE ENCRYPTION='Y'\G
*************************** 1. row ***************************
     SPACE: 4294967294
      NAME: mysql
SPACE_TYPE: General
ENCRYPTION: Y
*************************** 2. row ***************************
     SPACE: 2
      NAME: test/t1
SPACE_TYPE: Single
ENCRYPTION: Y
*************************** 3. row ***************************
     SPACE: 3
      NAME: ts1
SPACE_TYPE: General
ENCRYPTION: Y
```

When the `ENCRYPTION` option is specified in a
[`CREATE TABLE`](create-table.md "15.1.20 CREATE TABLE Statement") or
[`ALTER TABLE`](alter-table.md "15.1.9 ALTER TABLE Statement") statement, it is
recorded in the `CREATE_OPTIONS` column of
[`INFORMATION_SCHEMA.TABLES`](information-schema-tables-table.md "28.3.38 The INFORMATION_SCHEMA TABLES Table"). This
column can be queried to identify tables that reside in encrypted
file-per-table tablespaces.

```sql
mysql> SELECT TABLE_SCHEMA, TABLE_NAME, CREATE_OPTIONS FROM INFORMATION_SCHEMA.TABLES
       WHERE CREATE_OPTIONS LIKE '%ENCRYPTION%';
+--------------+------------+----------------+
| TABLE_SCHEMA | TABLE_NAME | CREATE_OPTIONS |
+--------------+------------+----------------+
| test         | t1         | ENCRYPTION="Y" |
+--------------+------------+----------------+
```

Query the Information Schema
[`INNODB_TABLESPACES`](information-schema-innodb-tablespaces-table.md "28.4.24 The INFORMATION_SCHEMA INNODB_TABLESPACES Table") table to retrieve
information about the tablespace associated with a particular
schema and table.

```sql
mysql> SELECT SPACE, NAME, SPACE_TYPE FROM INFORMATION_SCHEMA.INNODB_TABLESPACES WHERE NAME='test/t1';
+-------+---------+------------+
| SPACE | NAME    | SPACE_TYPE |
+-------+---------+------------+
|     3 | test/t1 | Single     |
+-------+---------+------------+
```

You can identify encryption-enabled schemas by querying the
Information Schema [`SCHEMATA`](information-schema-schemata-table.md "28.3.31 The INFORMATION_SCHEMA SCHEMATA Table") table.

```sql
mysql> SELECT SCHEMA_NAME, DEFAULT_ENCRYPTION FROM INFORMATION_SCHEMA.SCHEMATA
       WHERE DEFAULT_ENCRYPTION='YES';
+-------------+--------------------+
| SCHEMA_NAME | DEFAULT_ENCRYPTION |
+-------------+--------------------+
| test        | YES                |
+-------------+--------------------+
```

[`SHOW CREATE
SCHEMA`](show-create-database.md "15.7.7.6 SHOW CREATE DATABASE Statement") also shows the `DEFAULT
ENCRYPTION` clause.

### Monitoring Encryption Progress

You can monitor general tablespace and `mysql`
system tablespace encryption progress using
[Performance Schema](performance-schema.md "Chapter 29 MySQL Performance Schema").

The `stage/innodb/alter tablespace (encryption)`
stage event instrument reports `WORK_ESTIMATED`
and `WORK_COMPLETED` information for general
tablespace encryption operations.

The following example demonstrates how to enable the
`stage/innodb/alter tablespace (encryption)`
stage event instrument and related consumer tables to monitor
general tablespace or `mysql` system tablespace
encryption progress. For information about Performance Schema
stage event instruments and related consumers, see
[Section 29.12.5, “Performance Schema Stage Event Tables”](performance-schema-stage-tables.md "29.12.5 Performance Schema Stage Event Tables").

1. Enable the `stage/innodb/alter tablespace
   (encryption)` instrument:

   ```sql
   mysql> USE performance_schema;
   mysql> UPDATE setup_instruments SET ENABLED = 'YES'
          WHERE NAME LIKE 'stage/innodb/alter tablespace (encryption)';
   ```
2. Enable the stage event consumer tables, which include
   [`events_stages_current`](performance-schema-events-stages-current-table.md "29.12.5.1 The events_stages_current Table"),
   [`events_stages_history`](performance-schema-events-stages-history-table.md "29.12.5.2 The events_stages_history Table"), and
   [`events_stages_history_long`](performance-schema-events-stages-history-long-table.md "29.12.5.3 The events_stages_history_long Table").

   ```sql
   mysql> UPDATE setup_consumers SET ENABLED = 'YES' WHERE NAME LIKE '%stages%';
   ```
3. Run a tablespace encryption operation. In this example, a
   general tablespace named `ts1` is encrypted.

   ```sql
   mysql> ALTER TABLESPACE ts1 ENCRYPTION = 'Y';
   ```
4. Check the progress of the encryption operation by querying the
   Performance Schema
   [`events_stages_current`](performance-schema-events-stages-current-table.md "29.12.5.1 The events_stages_current Table") table.
   `WORK_ESTIMATED` reports the total number of
   pages in the tablespace. `WORK_COMPLETED`
   reports the number of pages processed.

   ```sql
   mysql> SELECT EVENT_NAME, WORK_ESTIMATED, WORK_COMPLETED FROM events_stages_current;
   +--------------------------------------------+----------------+----------------+
   | EVENT_NAME                                 | WORK_COMPLETED | WORK_ESTIMATED |
   +--------------------------------------------+----------------+----------------+
   | stage/innodb/alter tablespace (encryption) |           1056 |           1407 |
   +--------------------------------------------+----------------+----------------+
   ```

   The [`events_stages_current`](performance-schema-events-stages-current-table.md "29.12.5.1 The events_stages_current Table") table
   returns an empty set if the encryption operation has
   completed. In this case, you can check the
   [`events_stages_history`](performance-schema-events-stages-history-table.md "29.12.5.2 The events_stages_history Table") table to
   view event data for the completed operation. For example:

   ```sql
   mysql> SELECT EVENT_NAME, WORK_COMPLETED, WORK_ESTIMATED FROM events_stages_history;
   +--------------------------------------------+----------------+----------------+
   | EVENT_NAME                                 | WORK_COMPLETED | WORK_ESTIMATED |
   +--------------------------------------------+----------------+----------------+
   | stage/innodb/alter tablespace (encryption) |           1407 |           1407 |
   +--------------------------------------------+----------------+----------------+
   ```

### Encryption Usage Notes

- Plan appropriately when altering an existing file-per-table
  tablespace with the `ENCRYPTION` option.
  Tables residing in file-per-table tablespaces are rebuilt
  using the `COPY` algorithm. The
  `INPLACE` algorithm is used when altering the
  `ENCRYPTION` attribute of a general
  tablespace or the `mysql` system tablespace.
  The `INPLACE` algorithm permits concurrent
  DML on tables that reside in the general tablespace.
  Concurrent DDL is blocked.
- When a general tablespace or the `mysql`
  system tablespace is encrypted, all tables residing in the
  tablespace are encrypted. Likewise, a table created in an
  encrypted tablespace is encrypted.
- If the server exits or is stopped during normal operation, it
  is recommended to restart the server using the same encryption
  settings that were configured previously.
- The first master encryption key is generated when the first
  new or existing tablespace is encrypted.
- Master key rotation re-encrypts tablespaces keys but does not
  change the tablespace key itself. To change a tablespace key,
  you must disable and re-enable encryption. For file-per-table
  tablespaces, re-encrypting the tablespace is an
  `ALGORITHM=COPY` operation that rebuilds the
  table. For general tablespaces and the
  `mysql` system tablespace, it is an
  `ALGORITHM=INPLACE` operation, which does not
  require rebuilding tables that reside in the tablespace.
- If a table is created with both the
  [`COMPRESSION`](create-table.md "15.1.20 CREATE TABLE Statement")
  and
  [`ENCRYPTION`](create-table.md "15.1.20 CREATE TABLE Statement")
  options, compression is performed before tablespace data is
  encrypted.
- If a keyring data file (the file named by
  [`keyring_file_data`](keyring-system-variables.md#sysvar_keyring_file_data) or
  [`keyring_encrypted_file_data`](keyring-system-variables.md#sysvar_keyring_encrypted_file_data))
  is empty or missing, the first execution of
  [`ALTER INSTANCE ROTATE INNODB MASTER
  KEY`](alter-instance.md#alter-instance-rotate-innodb-master-key) creates a master encryption key.
- Uninstalling the `component_keyring_file` or
  `component_keyring_encrypted_file` component
  does not remove an existing keyring data file. Uninstalling
  the `keyring_file` or
  `keyring_encrypted_file` plugin does not
  remove an existing keyring data file.
- It is recommended that you not place a keyring data file under
  the same directory as tablespace data files.
- Modifying the
  [`keyring_file_data`](keyring-system-variables.md#sysvar_keyring_file_data) or
  [`keyring_encrypted_file_data`](keyring-system-variables.md#sysvar_keyring_encrypted_file_data)
  setting at runtime or when restarting the server can cause
  previously encrypted tablespaces to become inaccessible,
  resulting in lost data.
- Encryption is supported for the `InnoDB`
  `FULLTEXT` index tables that are created
  implicitly when adding a `FULLTEXT` index.
  For related information, see
  [InnoDB Full-Text Index Tables](innodb-fulltext-index.md#innodb-fulltext-index-tables "InnoDB Full-Text Index Tables").

### Encryption Limitations

- Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) is the only supported
  encryption algorithm. `InnoDB` tablespace
  encryption uses Electronic Codebook (ECB) block encryption
  mode for tablespace key encryption and Cipher Block Chaining
  (CBC) block encryption mode for data encryption. Padding is
  not used with CBC block encryption mode. Instead,
  `InnoDB` ensures that the text to be
  encrypted is a multiple of the block size.
- Encryption is only supported for
  [file-per-table](glossary.md#glos_file_per_table "file-per-table")
  tablespaces,
  [general](glossary.md#glos_general_tablespace "general tablespace")
  tablespaces, and the `mysql` system
  tablespace. Encryption support for general tablespaces was
  introduced in MySQL 8.0.13. Encryption support for the
  `mysql` system tablespace is available as of
  MySQL 8.0.16. Encryption is not supported for other tablespace
  types including the `InnoDB`
  [system
  tablespace](glossary.md#glos_system_tablespace "system tablespace").
- You cannot move or copy a table from an encrypted
  [file-per-table](glossary.md#glos_file_per_table "file-per-table")
  tablespace,
  [general](glossary.md#glos_general_tablespace "general tablespace")
  tablespace, or the `mysql` system tablespace
  to a tablespace type that does not support encryption.
- You cannot move or copy a table from an encrypted tablespace
  to an unencrypted tablespace. However, moving a table from an
  unencrypted tablespace to an encrypted one is permitted. For
  example, you can move or copy a table from a unencrypted
  [file-per-table](glossary.md#glos_file_per_table "file-per-table") or
  [general](glossary.md#glos_general_tablespace "general tablespace")
  tablespace to an encrypted general tablespace.
- By default, tablespace encryption only applies to data in the
  tablespace. Redo log and undo log data can be encrypted by
  enabling
  [`innodb_redo_log_encrypt`](innodb-parameters.md#sysvar_innodb_redo_log_encrypt) and
  [`innodb_undo_log_encrypt`](innodb-parameters.md#sysvar_innodb_undo_log_encrypt). See
  [Redo Log Encryption](innodb-data-encryption.md#innodb-data-encryption-redo-log "Redo Log Encryption"), and
  [Undo Log Encryption](innodb-data-encryption.md#innodb-data-encryption-undo-log "Undo Log Encryption"). For
  information about binary log file and relay log file
  encryption, see
  [Section 19.3.2, “Encrypting Binary Log Files and Relay Log Files”](replication-binlog-encryption.md "19.3.2 Encrypting Binary Log Files and Relay Log Files").
- It is not permitted to change the storage engine of a table
  that resides in, or previously resided in, an encrypted
  tablespace.
