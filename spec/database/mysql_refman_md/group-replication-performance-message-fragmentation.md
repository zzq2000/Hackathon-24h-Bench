### 20.7.5 Message Fragmentation

When an abnormally large message is sent between Group Replication
group members, it can result in some group members being reported
as failed and expelled from the group. This is because the single
thread used by Group Replication's group communication engine
(XCom, a Paxos variant) is occupied processing the message for too
long, so some of the group members might report the receiver as
failed. From MySQL 8.0.16, by default, large messages are
automatically split into fragments that are sent separately and
reassembled by the recipients.

The system variable
[`group_replication_communication_max_message_size`](group-replication-system-variables.md#sysvar_group_replication_communication_max_message_size)
specifies a maximum message size for Group Replication
communications, above which messages are fragmented. The default
maximum message size is 10485760 bytes (10 MiB). The greatest
permitted value is the same as the maximum value of the
[`replica_max_allowed_packet`](replication-options-replica.md#sysvar_replica_max_allowed_packet) and
[`slave_max_allowed_packet`](replication-options-replica.md#sysvar_slave_max_allowed_packet) system
variables, which is 1073741824 bytes (1 GB). The setting for
[`group_replication_communication_max_message_size`](group-replication-system-variables.md#sysvar_group_replication_communication_max_message_size)
must be less than
[`replica_max_allowed_packet`](replication-options-replica.md#sysvar_replica_max_allowed_packet) (or
[`slave_max_allowed_packet`](replication-options-replica.md#sysvar_slave_max_allowed_packet)),
because the applier thread cannot handle message fragments larger
than the maximum permitted packet size. To switch off
fragmentation, specify a zero value for
[`group_replication_communication_max_message_size`](group-replication-system-variables.md#sysvar_group_replication_communication_max_message_size).

As with most other Group Replication system variables, you must
restart the Group Replication plugin for the change to take
effect. For example:

```sql
STOP GROUP_REPLICATION;
SET GLOBAL group_replication_communication_max_message_size= 5242880;
START GROUP_REPLICATION;
```

Message delivery for a fragmented message is considered complete
when all the fragments of the message have been received and
reassembled by all the group members. Fragmented messages include
information in their headers that enables a member joining during
message transmission to recover the earlier fragments that were
sent before it joined. If the joining member fails to recover the
fragments, it expels itself from the group.

In order for a replication group to use fragmentation, all group
members must be at MySQL 8.0.16 or above, and the Group
Replication communication protocol version in use by the group
must allow fragmentation. You can inspect the communication
protocol in use by a group by using the
[`group_replication_get_communication_protocol()`](group-replication-functions-for-communication-protocol.md#function_group-replication-get-communication-protocol)
function, which returns the oldest MySQL Server version that the
group supports. Versions from MySQL 5.7.14 allow compression of
messages, and versions from MySQL 8.0.16 also allow fragmentation
of messages. If all group members are at MySQL 8.0.16 or above and
there is no requirement to allow members at earlier releases to
join, you can use the
[`group_replication_set_communication_protocol()`](group-replication-functions-for-communication-protocol.md#function_group-replication-set-communication-protocol)
function to set the communication protocol version to MySQL 8.0.16
or above in order to allow fragmentation. For more information,
see [Section 20.5.1.4, “Setting a Group's Communication Protocol Version”](group-replication-communication-protocol.md "20.5.1.4 Setting a Group's Communication Protocol Version").

If a replication group cannot use fragmentation because some
members do not support it, the system variable
[`group_replication_transaction_size_limit`](group-replication-system-variables.md#sysvar_group_replication_transaction_size_limit)
can be used to limit the maximum size of transactions the group
accepts. In MySQL 8.0, the default setting is approximately 143
MB. Transactions above this size are rolled back. You can also use
the system variable
[`group_replication_member_expel_timeout`](group-replication-system-variables.md#sysvar_group_replication_member_expel_timeout)
to allow additional time (up to an hour) before a member under
suspicion of having failed is expelled from the group.
