### 25.7.9 NDB Cluster Backups With NDB Cluster Replication

[25.7.9.1 NDB Cluster Replication: Automating Synchronization of the Replica to the Source Binary Log](mysql-cluster-replication-auto-sync.md)

[25.7.9.2 Point-In-Time Recovery Using NDB Cluster Replication](mysql-cluster-replication-pitr.md)

This section discusses making backups and restoring from them
using NDB Cluster replication. We assume that the replication
servers have already been configured as covered previously (see
[Section 25.7.5, “Preparing the NDB Cluster for Replication”](mysql-cluster-replication-preparation.md "25.7.5 Preparing the NDB Cluster for Replication"), and the
sections immediately following). This having been done, the
procedure for making a backup and then restoring from it is as
follows:

1. There are two different methods by which the backup may be
   started.

   - **Method A.**
     This method requires that the cluster backup process was
     previously enabled on the source server, prior to
     starting the replication process. This can be done by
     including the following line in a
     `[mysql_cluster]` section in the
     `my.cnf file`, where
     *`management_host`* is the IP
     address or host name of the
     [`NDB`](mysql-cluster.md "Chapter 25 MySQL NDB Cluster 8.0") management server for
     the source cluster, and *`port`*
     is the management server's port number:

     ```ini
     ndb-connectstring=management_host[:port]
     ```

     Note

     The port number needs to be specified only if the
     default port (1186) is not being used. See
     [Section 25.3.3, “Initial Configuration of NDB Cluster”](mysql-cluster-install-configuration.md "25.3.3 Initial Configuration of NDB Cluster"),
     for more information about ports and port allocation in
     NDB Cluster.

     In this case, the backup can be started by executing this
     statement on the replication source:

     ```terminal
     shellS> ndb_mgm -e "START BACKUP"
     ```
   - **Method B.**
     If the `my.cnf` file does not specify
     where to find the management host, you can start the
     backup process by passing this information to the
     [`NDB`](mysql-cluster.md "Chapter 25 MySQL NDB Cluster 8.0") management client as
     part of the [`START
     BACKUP`](mysql-cluster-backup-using-management-client.md "25.6.8.2 Using The NDB Cluster Management Client to Create a Backup") command. This can be done as shown
     here, where *`management_host`*
     and *`port`* are the host name
     and port number of the management server:

     ```terminal
     shellS> ndb_mgm management_host:port -e "START BACKUP"
     ```

     In our scenario as outlined earlier (see
     [Section 25.7.5, “Preparing the NDB Cluster for Replication”](mysql-cluster-replication-preparation.md "25.7.5 Preparing the NDB Cluster for Replication")),
     this would be executed as follows:

     ```terminal
     shellS> ndb_mgm rep-source:1186 -e "START BACKUP"
     ```
2. Copy the cluster backup files to the replica that is being
   brought on line. Each system running an
   [**ndbd**](mysql-cluster-programs-ndbd.md "25.5.1 ndbd — The NDB Cluster Data Node Daemon") process for the source cluster has
   cluster backup files located on it, and
   *all* of these files must be copied to the
   replica to ensure a successful restore. The backup files can
   be copied into any directory on the computer where the
   replica's management host resides, as long as the MySQL
   and NDB binaries have read permissions in that directory. In
   this case, we assume that these files have been copied into
   the directory `/var/BACKUPS/BACKUP-1`.

   While it is not necessary that the replica cluster have the
   same number of data nodes as the source, it is highly
   recommended this number be the same. It
   *is* necessary that the replication process
   is prevented from starting when the replica server starts. You
   can do this by starting the replica with the
   [`--skip-slave-start`](replication-options-replica.md#option_mysqld_skip-slave-start) option on
   the command line, by including
   `skip-slave-start` in the replica's
   `my.cnf` file, or in NDB 8.0.24 or later,
   by setting the
   [`skip_slave_start`](replication-options-replica.md#sysvar_skip_slave_start) system
   variable.
3. Create any databases on the replica cluster that are present
   on the source cluster and that are to be replicated.

   Important

   A [`CREATE DATABASE`](create-database.md "15.1.12 CREATE DATABASE Statement") (or
   [`CREATE
   SCHEMA`](create-database.md "15.1.12 CREATE DATABASE Statement")) statement corresponding to each database
   to be replicated must be executed on each SQL node in the
   replica cluster.
4. Reset the replica cluster using this statement in the
   [**mysql**](mysql.md "6.5.1 mysql — The MySQL Command-Line Client") client:

   ```sql
   mysqlR> RESET SLAVE;
   ```

   In NDB 8.0.22 or later, you can also use this statement:

   ```sql
   mysqlR> RESET REPLICA;
   ```
5. You can now start the cluster restoration process on the
   replica using the [**ndb\_restore**](mysql-cluster-programs-ndb-restore.md "25.5.23 ndb_restore — Restore an NDB Cluster Backup") command for
   each backup file in turn. For the first of these, it is
   necessary to include the `-m` option to restore
   the cluster metadata, as shown here:

   ```terminal
   shellR> ndb_restore -c replica_host:port -n node-id \
           -b backup-id -m -r dir
   ```

   *`dir`* is the path to the directory
   where the backup files have been placed on the replica. For
   the [**ndb\_restore**](mysql-cluster-programs-ndb-restore.md "25.5.23 ndb_restore — Restore an NDB Cluster Backup") commands corresponding to
   the remaining backup files, the `-m` option
   should *not* be used.

   For restoring from a source cluster with four data nodes (as
   shown in the figure in
   [Section 25.7, “NDB Cluster Replication”](mysql-cluster-replication.md "25.7 NDB Cluster Replication")) where the backup
   files have been copied to the directory
   `/var/BACKUPS/BACKUP-1`, the proper
   sequence of commands to be executed on the replica might look
   like this:

   ```terminal
   shellR> ndb_restore -c replica-host:1186 -n 2 -b 1 -m \
           -r ./var/BACKUPS/BACKUP-1
   shellR> ndb_restore -c replica-host:1186 -n 3 -b 1 \
           -r ./var/BACKUPS/BACKUP-1
   shellR> ndb_restore -c replica-host:1186 -n 4 -b 1 \
           -r ./var/BACKUPS/BACKUP-1
   shellR> ndb_restore -c replica-host:1186 -n 5 -b 1 -e \
           -r ./var/BACKUPS/BACKUP-1
   ```

   Important

   The `-e` (or
   [`--restore-epoch`](mysql-cluster-programs-ndb-restore.md#option_ndb_restore_restore-epoch)) option
   in the final invocation of [**ndb\_restore**](mysql-cluster-programs-ndb-restore.md "25.5.23 ndb_restore — Restore an NDB Cluster Backup") in
   this example is required to make sure that the epoch is
   written to the replica's
   `mysql.ndb_apply_status` table. Without
   this information, the replica cannot synchronize properly
   with the source. (See
   [Section 25.5.23, “ndb\_restore — Restore an NDB Cluster Backup”](mysql-cluster-programs-ndb-restore.md "25.5.23 ndb_restore — Restore an NDB Cluster Backup").)
6. Now you need to obtain the most recent epoch from the
   `ndb_apply_status` table on the replica (as
   discussed in
   [Section 25.7.8, “Implementing Failover with NDB Cluster Replication”](mysql-cluster-replication-failover.md "25.7.8 Implementing Failover with NDB Cluster Replication")):

   ```sql
   mysqlR> SELECT @latest:=MAX(epoch)
           FROM mysql.ndb_apply_status;
   ```
7. Using `@latest` as the epoch value obtained
   in the previous step, you can obtain the correct starting
   position `@pos` in the correct binary log
   file `@file` from the
   `mysql.ndb_binlog_index` table on the source.
   The query shown here gets these from the
   `Position` and `File`
   columns from the last epoch applied before the logical restore
   position:

   ```sql
   mysqlS> SELECT
        ->     @file:=SUBSTRING_INDEX(File, '/', -1),
        ->     @pos:=Position
        -> FROM mysql.ndb_binlog_index
        -> WHERE epoch > @latest
        -> ORDER BY epoch ASC LIMIT 1;
   ```

   In the event that there is currently no replication traffic,
   you can get similar information by running
   [`SHOW MASTER STATUS`](show-master-status.md "15.7.7.23 SHOW MASTER STATUS Statement") on the
   source and using the value shown in the
   `Position` column of the output for the file
   whose name has the suffix with the greatest value for all
   files shown in the `File` column. In this
   case, you must determine which file this is and supply the
   name in the next step manually or by parsing the output with a
   script.
8. Using the values obtained in the previous step, you can now
   issue the appropriate in the replica's
   [**mysql**](mysql.md "6.5.1 mysql — The MySQL Command-Line Client") client. In NDB 8.0.23 and later, use
   the following [`CHANGE REPLICATION SOURCE
   TO`](change-replication-source-to.md "15.4.2.3 CHANGE REPLICATION SOURCE TO Statement") statement:

   ```sql
   mysqlR> CHANGE REPLICATION SOURCE TO
        ->     SOURCE_LOG_FILE='@file',
        ->     SOURCE_LOG_POS=@pos;
   ```

   Prior to NDB 8.0.23, you can must use the
   [`CHANGE MASTER TO`](change-master-to.md "15.4.2.1 CHANGE MASTER TO Statement") statement
   shown here:

   ```sql
   mysqlR> CHANGE MASTER TO
        ->     MASTER_LOG_FILE='@file',
        ->     MASTER_LOG_POS=@pos;
   ```
9. Now that the replica knows from what point in which binary log
   file to start reading data from the source, you can cause the
   replica to begin replicating with this statement:

   ```sql
   mysqlR> START SLAVE;
   ```

   Beginning with NDB 8.0.22, you can also use the following
   statement:

   ```sql
   mysqlR> START REPLICA;
   ```

To perform a backup and restore on a second replication channel,
it is necessary only to repeat these steps, substituting the host
names and IDs of the secondary source and replica for those of the
primary source and replica servers where appropriate, and running
the preceding statements on them.

restoring Cluster from backups, see
