### 27.5.2 View Processing Algorithms

The optional `ALGORITHM` clause for
[`CREATE VIEW`](create-view.md "15.1.23 CREATE VIEW Statement") or
[`ALTER VIEW`](alter-view.md "15.1.11 ALTER VIEW Statement") is a MySQL extension to
standard SQL. It affects how MySQL processes the view.
`ALGORITHM` takes three values:
`MERGE`, `TEMPTABLE`, or
`UNDEFINED`.

- For `MERGE`, the text of a statement that
  refers to the view and the view definition are merged such
  that parts of the view definition replace corresponding parts
  of the statement.
- For `TEMPTABLE`, the results from the view
  are retrieved into a temporary table, which then is used to
  execute the statement.
- For `UNDEFINED`, MySQL chooses which
  algorithm to use. It prefers `MERGE` over
  `TEMPTABLE` if possible, because
  `MERGE` is usually more efficient and because
  a view cannot be updated if a temporary table is used.
- If no `ALGORITHM` clause is present, the
  default algorithm is determined by the value of the
  [`derived_merge`](switchable-optimizations.md#optflag_derived-merge) flag of the
  [`optimizer_switch`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_optimizer_switch) system
  variable. For additional discussion, see
  [Section 10.2.2.4, “Optimizing Derived Tables, View References, and Common Table Expressions
  with Merging or Materialization”](derived-table-optimization.md "10.2.2.4 Optimizing Derived Tables, View References, and Common Table Expressions with Merging or Materialization").

A reason to specify `TEMPTABLE` explicitly is
that locks can be released on underlying tables after the
temporary table has been created and before it is used to finish
processing the statement. This might result in quicker lock
release than the `MERGE` algorithm so that other
clients that use the view are not blocked as long.

A view algorithm can be `UNDEFINED` for three
reasons:

- No `ALGORITHM` clause is present in the
  [`CREATE VIEW`](create-view.md "15.1.23 CREATE VIEW Statement") statement.
- The [`CREATE VIEW`](create-view.md "15.1.23 CREATE VIEW Statement") statement has
  an explicit `ALGORITHM = UNDEFINED` clause.
- `ALGORITHM = MERGE` is specified for a view
  that can be processed only with a temporary table. In this
  case, MySQL generates a warning and sets the algorithm to
  `UNDEFINED`.

As mentioned earlier, `MERGE` is handled by
merging corresponding parts of a view definition into the
statement that refers to the view. The following examples briefly
illustrate how the `MERGE` algorithm works. The
examples assume that there is a view `v_merge`
that has this definition:

```sql
CREATE ALGORITHM = MERGE VIEW v_merge (vc1, vc2) AS
SELECT c1, c2 FROM t WHERE c3 > 100;
```

Example 1: Suppose that we issue this statement:

```sql
SELECT * FROM v_merge;
```

MySQL handles the statement as follows:

- `v_merge` becomes `t`
- `*` becomes `vc1, vc2`,
  which corresponds to `c1, c2`
- The view `WHERE` clause is added

The resulting statement to be executed becomes:

```sql
SELECT c1, c2 FROM t WHERE c3 > 100;
```

Example 2: Suppose that we issue this statement:

```sql
SELECT * FROM v_merge WHERE vc1 < 100;
```

This statement is handled similarly to the previous one, except
that `vc1 < 100` becomes `c1 <
100` and the view `WHERE` clause is
added to the statement `WHERE` clause using an
[`AND`](logical-operators.md#operator_and) connective (and parentheses are
added to make sure the parts of the clause are executed with
correct precedence). The resulting statement to be executed
becomes:

```sql
SELECT c1, c2 FROM t WHERE (c3 > 100) AND (c1 < 100);
```

Effectively, the statement to be executed has a
`WHERE` clause of this form:

```sql
WHERE (select WHERE) AND (view WHERE)
```

If the `MERGE` algorithm cannot be used, a
temporary table must be used instead. Constructs that prevent
merging are the same as those that prevent merging in derived
tables and common table expressions. Examples are `SELECT
DISTINCT` or `LIMIT` in the subquery.
