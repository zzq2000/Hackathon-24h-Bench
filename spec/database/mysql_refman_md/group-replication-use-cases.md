### 20.1.2 Group Replication Use Cases

Group Replication enables you to create fault-tolerant systems
with redundancy by replicating the system state to a set of
servers. Even if some of the servers subsequently fail, as long it
is not all or a majority, the system is still available. Depending
on the number of servers which fail the group might have degraded
performance or scalability, but it is still available. Server
failures are isolated and independent. They are tracked by a group
membership service which relies on a distributed failure detector
that is able to signal when any servers leave the group, either
voluntarily or due to an unexpected halt. There is a distributed
recovery procedure to ensure that when servers join the group they
are brought up to date automatically. There is no need for server
failover, and the multi-source update everywhere nature ensures
that even updates are not blocked in the event of a single server
failure. To summarize, MySQL Group Replication guarantees that the
database service is continuously available.

It is important to understand that although the database service
is available, in the event of an unexpected server exit, those
clients connected to it must be redirected, or failed over, to a
different server. This is not something Group Replication attempts
to resolve. A connector, load balancer, router, or some form of
middleware are more suitable to deal with this issue. For example
see [MySQL Router 8.0](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/mysql-router/8.0/en/).

To summarize, MySQL Group Replication provides a highly available,
highly elastic, dependable MySQL service.

Tip

To deploy multiple instances of MySQL, you can use [InnoDB Cluster](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/mysql-shell/8.0/en/mysql-innodb-cluster.html) which enables you to easily administer a group of MySQL server instances in [MySQL Shell](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/mysql-shell/8.0/en/). InnoDB Cluster wraps MySQL Group Replication in a programmatic environment that enables you easily deploy a cluster of MySQL instances to achieve high availability. In addition, InnoDB Cluster interfaces seamlessly with [MySQL Router](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/mysql-router/8.0/en/), which enables your applications to connect to the cluster without writing your own failover process. For similar use cases that do not require high availability, however, you can use [InnoDB ReplicaSet](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/mysql-shell/8.0/en/mysql-innodb-replicaset.html). Installation instructions for MySQL Shell can be found [here](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/mysql-shell/8.0/en/mysql-shell-install.html).

#### Example Use Cases

The following examples are typical use cases for Group
Replication.

- *Elastic Replication* - Environments that
  require a very fluid replication infrastructure, where the
  number of servers has to grow or shrink dynamically and with
  as few side-effects as possible. For instance, database
  services for the cloud.
- *Highly Available Shards* - Sharding is a
  popular approach to achieve write scale-out. Use MySQL Group
  Replication to implement highly available shards, where each
  shard maps to a replication group.
- *Alternative to asynchronous Source-Replica
  replication* - In certain situations, using a
  single source server makes it a single point of contention.
  Writing to an entire group may prove more scalable under
  certain circumstances.
- *Autonomic Systems* - Additionally, you
  can deploy MySQL Group Replication purely for the automation
  that is built into the replication protocol (described
  already in this and previous chapters).
