#### 29.12.7.2 The events\_transactions\_history Table

The [`events_transactions_history`](performance-schema-events-transactions-history-table.md "29.12.7.2 The events_transactions_history Table")
table contains the *`N`* most recent
transaction events that have ended per thread. Transaction
events are not added to the table until they have ended. When
the table contains the maximum number of rows for a given
thread, the oldest thread row is discarded when a new row for
that thread is added. When a thread ends, all its rows are
discarded.

The Performance Schema autosizes the value of
*`N`* during server startup. To set the
number of rows per thread explicitly, set the
[`performance_schema_events_transactions_history_size`](performance-schema-system-variables.md#sysvar_performance_schema_events_transactions_history_size)
system variable at server startup.

The [`events_transactions_history`](performance-schema-events-transactions-history-table.md "29.12.7.2 The events_transactions_history Table")
table has the same columns and indexing as
[`events_transactions_current`](performance-schema-events-transactions-current-table.md "29.12.7.1 The events_transactions_current Table"). See
[Section 29.12.7.1, “The events\_transactions\_current Table”](performance-schema-events-transactions-current-table.md "29.12.7.1 The events_transactions_current Table").

[`TRUNCATE TABLE`](truncate-table.md "15.1.37 TRUNCATE TABLE Statement") is permitted for
the [`events_transactions_history`](performance-schema-events-transactions-history-table.md "29.12.7.2 The events_transactions_history Table")
table. It removes the rows.

For more information about the relationship between the three
transaction event tables, see
[Section 29.9, “Performance Schema Tables for Current and Historical Events”](performance-schema-event-tables.md "29.9 Performance Schema Tables for Current and Historical Events").

For information about configuring whether to collect
transaction events, see
[Section 29.12.7, “Performance Schema Transaction Tables”](performance-schema-transaction-tables.md "29.12.7 Performance Schema Transaction Tables").
