### 8.2.7 Access Control, Stage 2: Request Verification

After the server accepts a connection, it enters Stage 2 of access
control. For each request that you issue through the connection,
the server determines what operation you want to perform, then
checks whether your privileges are sufficient. This is where the
privilege columns in the grant tables come into play. These
privileges can come from any of the `user`,
`global_grants`, `db`,
`tables_priv`, `columns_priv`,
or `procs_priv` tables. (You may find it helpful
to refer to [Section 8.2.3, “Grant Tables”](grant-tables.md "8.2.3 Grant Tables"), which lists the
columns present in each grant table.)

The `user` and `global_grants`
tables grant global privileges. The rows in these tables for a
given account indicate the account privileges that apply on a
global basis no matter what the default database is. For example,
if the `user` table grants you the
[`DELETE`](privileges-provided.md#priv_delete) privilege, you can delete
rows from any table in any database on the server host. It is wise
to grant privileges in the `user` table only to
people who need them, such as database administrators. For other
users, leave all privileges in the `user` table
set to `'N'` and grant privileges at more
specific levels only (for particular databases, tables, columns,
or routines). It is also possible to grant database privileges
globally but use partial revokes to restrict them from being
exercised on specific databases (see
[Section 8.2.12, “Privilege Restriction Using Partial Revokes”](partial-revokes.md "8.2.12 Privilege Restriction Using Partial Revokes")).

The `db` table grants database-specific
privileges. Values in the scope columns of this table can take the
following forms:

- A blank `User` value matches the anonymous
  user. A nonblank value matches literally; there are no
  wildcards in user names.
- The wildcard characters `%` and
  `_` can be used in the
  `Host` and `Db` columns.
  These have the same meaning as for pattern-matching operations
  performed with the [`LIKE`](string-comparison-functions.md#operator_like) operator.
  If you want to use either character literally when granting
  privileges, you must escape it with a backslash. For example,
  to include the underscore character (`_`) as
  part of a database name, specify it as `\_`
  in the [`GRANT`](grant.md "15.7.1.6 GRANT Statement") statement.
- A `'%'` or blank `Host`
  value means “any host.”
- A `'%'` or blank `Db` value
  means “any database.”

The server reads the `db` table into memory and
sorts it at the same time that it reads the
`user` table. The server sorts the
`db` table based on the `Host`,
`Db`, and `User` scope columns.
As with the `user` table, sorting puts the
most-specific values first and least-specific values last, and
when the server looks for matching rows, it uses the first match
that it finds.

The `tables_priv`,
`columns_priv`, and `procs_priv`
tables grant table-specific, column-specific, and routine-specific
privileges. Values in the scope columns of these tables can take
the following forms:

- The wildcard characters `%` and
  `_` can be used in the
  `Host` column. These have the same meaning as
  for pattern-matching operations performed with the
  [`LIKE`](string-comparison-functions.md#operator_like) operator.
- A `'%'` or blank `Host`
  value means “any host.”
- The `Db`, `Table_name`,
  `Column_name`, and
  `Routine_name` columns cannot contain
  wildcards or be blank.

The server sorts the `tables_priv`,
`columns_priv`, and `procs_priv`
tables based on the `Host`,
`Db`, and `User` columns. This
is similar to `db` table sorting, but simpler
because only the `Host` column can contain
wildcards.

The server uses the sorted tables to verify each request that it
receives. For requests that require administrative privileges such
as [`SHUTDOWN`](privileges-provided.md#priv_shutdown) or
[`RELOAD`](privileges-provided.md#priv_reload), the server checks only the
`user` and `global_privilege`
tables because those are the only tables that specify
administrative privileges. The server grants access if a row for
the account in those tables permits the requested operation and
denies access otherwise. For example, if you want to execute
[**mysqladmin shutdown**](mysqladmin.md "6.5.2 mysqladmin — A MySQL Server Administration Program") but your
`user` table row does not grant the
[`SHUTDOWN`](privileges-provided.md#priv_shutdown) privilege to you, the
server denies access without even checking the
`db` table. (The latter table contains no
`Shutdown_priv` column, so there is no need to
check it.)

For database-related requests
([`INSERT`](insert.md "15.2.7 INSERT Statement"),
[`UPDATE`](update.md "15.2.17 UPDATE Statement"), and so on), the server
first checks the user's global privileges in the
`user` table row (less any privilege restrictions
imposed by partial revokes). If the row permits the requested
operation, access is granted. If the global privileges in the
`user` table are insufficient, the server
determines the user's database-specific privileges from the
`db` table:

- The server looks in the `db` table for a
  match on the `Host`, `Db`,
  and `User` columns.
- The `Host` and `User`
  columns are matched to the connecting user's host name and
  MySQL user name.
- The `Db` column is matched to the database
  that the user wants to access.
- If there is no row for the `Host` and
  `User`, access is denied.

After determining the database-specific privileges granted by the
`db` table rows, the server adds them to the
global privileges granted by the `user` table. If
the result permits the requested operation, access is granted.
Otherwise, the server successively checks the user's table and
column privileges in the `tables_priv` and
`columns_priv` tables, adds those to the user's
privileges, and permits or denies access based on the result. For
stored-routine operations, the server uses the
`procs_priv` table rather than
`tables_priv` and
`columns_priv`.

Expressed in boolean terms, the preceding description of how a
user's privileges are calculated may be summarized like this:

```sql
global privileges
OR database privileges
OR table privileges
OR column privileges
OR routine privileges
```

It may not be apparent why, if the global privileges are initially
found to be insufficient for the requested operation, the server
adds those privileges to the database, table, and column
privileges later. The reason is that a request might require more
than one type of privilege. For example, if you execute an
[`INSERT INTO ...
SELECT`](insert-select.md "15.2.7.1 INSERT ... SELECT Statement") statement, you need both the
[`INSERT`](privileges-provided.md#priv_insert) and the
[`SELECT`](privileges-provided.md#priv_select) privileges. Your privileges
might be such that the `user` table row grants
one privilege global and the `db` table row
grants the other specifically for the relevant database. In this
case, you have the necessary privileges to perform the request,
but the server cannot tell that from either your global or
database privileges alone. It must make an access-control decision
based on the combined privileges.
