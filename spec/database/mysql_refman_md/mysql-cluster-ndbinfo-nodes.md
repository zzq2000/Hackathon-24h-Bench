#### 25.6.16.47 The ndbinfo nodes Table

This table contains information on the status of data nodes. For
each data node that is running in the cluster, a corresponding
row in this table provides the node's node ID, status, and
uptime. For nodes that are starting, it also shows the current
start phase.

The `nodes` table contains the following
columns:

- `node_id`

  The data node's unique node ID in the cluster.
- `uptime`

  Time since the node was last started, in seconds.
- `status`

  Current status of the data node; see text for possible
  values.
- `start_phase`

  If the data node is starting, the current start phase.
- `config_generation`

  The version of the cluster configuration file in use on this
  data node.

##### Notes

The `uptime` column shows the time in seconds
that this node has been running since it was last started or
restarted. This is a [`BIGINT`](integer-types.md "13.1.2 Integer Types (Exact Value) - INTEGER, INT, SMALLINT, TINYINT, MEDIUMINT, BIGINT")
value. This figure includes the time actually needed to start
the node; in other words, this counter starts running the moment
that [**ndbd**](mysql-cluster-programs-ndbd.md "25.5.1 ndbd — The NDB Cluster Data Node Daemon") or [**ndbmtd**](mysql-cluster-programs-ndbmtd.md "25.5.3 ndbmtd — The NDB Cluster Data Node Daemon (Multi-Threaded)") is
first invoked; thus, even for a node that has not yet finished
starting, `uptime` may show a nonzero value.

The `status` column shows the node's
current status. This is one of: `NOTHING`,
`CMVMI`, `STARTING`,
`STARTED`, `SINGLEUSER`,
`STOPPING_1`, `STOPPING_2`,
`STOPPING_3`, or `STOPPING_4`.
When the status is `STARTING`, you can see the
current start phase in the `start_phase` column
(see later in this section). `SINGLEUSER` is
displayed in the `status` column for all data
nodes when the cluster is in single user mode (see
[Section 25.6.6, “NDB Cluster Single User Mode”](mysql-cluster-single-user-mode.md "25.6.6 NDB Cluster Single User Mode")). Seeing one of
the `STOPPING` states does not necessarily mean
that the node is shutting down but can mean rather that it is
entering a new state. For example, if you put the cluster in
single user mode, you can sometimes see data nodes report their
state briefly as `STOPPING_2` before the status
changes to `SINGLEUSER`.

The `start_phase` column uses the same range of
values as those used in the output of the
[**ndb\_mgm**](mysql-cluster-programs-ndb-mgm.md "25.5.5 ndb_mgm — The NDB Cluster Management Client") client
[`node_id
STATUS`](mysql-cluster-mgm-client-commands.md#ndbclient-status) command (see
[Section 25.6.1, “Commands in the NDB Cluster Management Client”](mysql-cluster-mgm-client-commands.md "25.6.1 Commands in the NDB Cluster Management Client")). If the
node is not currently starting, then this column shows
`0`. For a listing of NDB Cluster start phases
with descriptions, see
[Section 25.6.4, “Summary of NDB Cluster Start Phases”](mysql-cluster-start-phases.md "25.6.4 Summary of NDB Cluster Start Phases").

The `config_generation` column shows which
version of the cluster configuration is in effect on each data
node. This can be useful when performing a rolling restart of
the cluster in order to make changes in configuration
parameters. For example, from the output of the following
[`SELECT`](select.md "15.2.13 SELECT Statement") statement, you can see
that node 3 is not yet using the latest version of the cluster
configuration (`6`) although nodes 1, 2, and 4
are doing so:

```sql
mysql> USE ndbinfo;
Database changed
mysql> SELECT * FROM nodes;
+---------+--------+---------+-------------+-------------------+
| node_id | uptime | status  | start_phase | config_generation |
+---------+--------+---------+-------------+-------------------+
|       1 |  10462 | STARTED |           0 |                 6 |
|       2 |  10460 | STARTED |           0 |                 6 |
|       3 |  10457 | STARTED |           0 |                 5 |
|       4 |  10455 | STARTED |           0 |                 6 |
+---------+--------+---------+-------------+-------------------+
2 rows in set (0.04 sec)
```

Therefore, for the case just shown, you should restart node 3 to
complete the rolling restart of the cluster.

Nodes that are stopped are not accounted for in this table.
Suppose that you have an NDB Cluster with 4 data nodes (node IDs
1, 2, 3 and 4), and all nodes are running normally, then this
table contains 4 rows, 1 for each data node:

```sql
mysql> USE ndbinfo;
Database changed
mysql> SELECT * FROM nodes;
+---------+--------+---------+-------------+-------------------+
| node_id | uptime | status  | start_phase | config_generation |
+---------+--------+---------+-------------+-------------------+
|       1 |  11776 | STARTED |           0 |                 6 |
|       2 |  11774 | STARTED |           0 |                 6 |
|       3 |  11771 | STARTED |           0 |                 6 |
|       4 |  11769 | STARTED |           0 |                 6 |
+---------+--------+---------+-------------+-------------------+
4 rows in set (0.04 sec)
```

If you shut down one of the nodes, only the nodes that are still
running are represented in the output of this
[`SELECT`](select.md "15.2.13 SELECT Statement") statement, as shown here:

```ndbmgm
ndb_mgm> 2 STOP
Node 2: Node shutdown initiated
Node 2: Node shutdown completed.
Node 2 has shutdown.
```

```sql
mysql> SELECT * FROM nodes;
+---------+--------+---------+-------------+-------------------+
| node_id | uptime | status  | start_phase | config_generation |
+---------+--------+---------+-------------+-------------------+
|       1 |  11807 | STARTED |           0 |                 6 |
|       3 |  11802 | STARTED |           0 |                 6 |
|       4 |  11800 | STARTED |           0 |                 6 |
+---------+--------+---------+-------------+-------------------+
3 rows in set (0.02 sec)
```
