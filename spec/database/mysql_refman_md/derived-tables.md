#### 15.2.15.8 Derived Tables

This section discusses general characteristics of derived
tables. For information about lateral derived tables preceded by
the `LATERAL` keyword, see
[Section 15.2.15.9, “Lateral Derived Tables”](lateral-derived-tables.md "15.2.15.9 Lateral Derived Tables").

A derived table is an expression that generates a table within
the scope of a query `FROM` clause. For
example, a subquery in a [`SELECT`](select.md "15.2.13 SELECT Statement")
statement `FROM` clause is a derived table:

```sql
SELECT ... FROM (subquery) [AS] tbl_name ...
```

The [`JSON_TABLE()`](json-table-functions.md#function_json-table) function
generates a table and provides another way to create a derived
table:

```sql
SELECT * FROM JSON_TABLE(arg_list) [AS] tbl_name ...
```

The `[AS] tbl_name`
clause is mandatory because every table in a
`FROM` clause must have a name. Any columns in
the derived table must have unique names. Alternatively,
*`tbl_name`* may be followed by a
parenthesized list of names for the derived table columns:

```sql
SELECT ... FROM (subquery) [AS] tbl_name (col_list) ...
```

The number of column names must be the same as the number of
table columns.

For the sake of illustration, assume that you have this table:

```sql
CREATE TABLE t1 (s1 INT, s2 CHAR(5), s3 FLOAT);
```

Here is how to use a subquery in the `FROM`
clause, using the example table:

```sql
INSERT INTO t1 VALUES (1,'1',1.0);
INSERT INTO t1 VALUES (2,'2',2.0);
SELECT sb1,sb2,sb3
  FROM (SELECT s1 AS sb1, s2 AS sb2, s3*2 AS sb3 FROM t1) AS sb
  WHERE sb1 > 1;
```

Result:

```none
+------+------+------+
| sb1  | sb2  | sb3  |
+------+------+------+
|    2 | 2    |    4 |
+------+------+------+
```

Here is another example: Suppose that you want to know the
average of a set of sums for a grouped table. This does not
work:

```sql
SELECT AVG(SUM(column1)) FROM t1 GROUP BY column1;
```

However, this query provides the desired information:

```sql
SELECT AVG(sum_column1)
  FROM (SELECT SUM(column1) AS sum_column1
        FROM t1 GROUP BY column1) AS t1;
```

Notice that the column name used within the subquery
(`sum_column1`) is recognized in the outer
query.

The column names for a derived table come from its select list:

```sql
mysql> SELECT * FROM (SELECT 1, 2, 3, 4) AS dt;
+---+---+---+---+
| 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 |
+---+---+---+---+
| 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 |
+---+---+---+---+
```

To provide column names explicitly, follow the derived table
name with a parenthesized list of column names:

```sql
mysql> SELECT * FROM (SELECT 1, 2, 3, 4) AS dt (a, b, c, d);
+---+---+---+---+
| a | b | c | d |
+---+---+---+---+
| 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 |
+---+---+---+---+
```

A derived table can return a scalar, column, row, or table.

Derived tables are subject to these restrictions:

- A derived table cannot contain references to other tables of
  the same [`SELECT`](select.md "15.2.13 SELECT Statement") (use a
  `LATERAL` derived table for that; see
  [Section 15.2.15.9, “Lateral Derived Tables”](lateral-derived-tables.md "15.2.15.9 Lateral Derived Tables")).
- Prior to MySQL 8.0.14, a derived table cannot contain outer
  references. This is a MySQL restriction that is lifted in
  MySQL 8.0.14, not a restriction of the SQL standard. For
  example, the derived table `dt` in the
  following query contains a reference `t1.b`
  to the table `t1` in the outer query:

  ```sql
  SELECT * FROM t1
  WHERE t1.d > (SELECT AVG(dt.a)
                  FROM (SELECT SUM(t2.a) AS a
                        FROM t2
                        WHERE t2.b = t1.b GROUP BY t2.c) dt
                WHERE dt.a > 10);
  ```

  The query is valid in MySQL 8.0.14 and higher. Before
  8.0.14, it produces an error: `Unknown column 't1.b'
  in 'where clause'`

The optimizer determines information about derived tables in
such a way that [`EXPLAIN`](explain.md "15.8.2 EXPLAIN Statement") does not
need to materialize them. See
[Section 10.2.2.4, “Optimizing Derived Tables, View References, and Common Table Expressions
with Merging or Materialization”](derived-table-optimization.md "10.2.2.4 Optimizing Derived Tables, View References, and Common Table Expressions with Merging or Materialization").

It is possible under certain circumstances that using
[`EXPLAIN
SELECT`](explain.md "15.8.2 EXPLAIN Statement") modifies table data. This can occur if the
outer query accesses any tables and an inner query invokes a
stored function that changes one or more rows of a table.
Suppose that there are two tables `t1` and
`t2` in database `d1`, and a
stored function `f1` that modifies
`t2`, created as shown here:

```sql
CREATE DATABASE d1;
USE d1;
CREATE TABLE t1 (c1 INT);
CREATE TABLE t2 (c1 INT);
CREATE FUNCTION f1(p1 INT) RETURNS INT
  BEGIN
    INSERT INTO t2 VALUES (p1);
    RETURN p1;
  END;
```

Referencing the function directly in an
[`EXPLAIN
SELECT`](explain.md "15.8.2 EXPLAIN Statement") has no effect on `t2`, as
shown here:

```sql
mysql> SELECT * FROM t2;
Empty set (0.02 sec)

mysql> EXPLAIN SELECT f1(5)\G
*************************** 1. row ***************************
           id: 1
  select_type: SIMPLE
        table: NULL
   partitions: NULL
         type: NULL
possible_keys: NULL
          key: NULL
      key_len: NULL
          ref: NULL
         rows: NULL
     filtered: NULL
        Extra: No tables used
1 row in set (0.01 sec)

mysql> SELECT * FROM t2;
Empty set (0.01 sec)
```

This is because the [`SELECT`](select.md "15.2.13 SELECT Statement")
statement did not reference any tables, as can be seen in the
`table` and `Extra` columns of
the output. This is also true of the following nested
[`SELECT`](select.md "15.2.13 SELECT Statement"):

```sql
mysql> EXPLAIN SELECT NOW() AS a1, (SELECT f1(5)) AS a2\G
*************************** 1. row ***************************
           id: 1
  select_type: PRIMARY
        table: NULL
         type: NULL
possible_keys: NULL
          key: NULL
      key_len: NULL
          ref: NULL
         rows: NULL
     filtered: NULL
        Extra: No tables used
1 row in set, 1 warning (0.00 sec)

mysql> SHOW WARNINGS;
+-------+------+------------------------------------------+
| Level | Code | Message                                  |
+-------+------+------------------------------------------+
| Note  | 1249 | Select 2 was reduced during optimization |
+-------+------+------------------------------------------+
1 row in set (0.00 sec)

mysql> SELECT * FROM t2;
Empty set (0.00 sec)
```

However, if the outer [`SELECT`](select.md "15.2.13 SELECT Statement")
references any tables, the optimizer executes the statement in
the subquery as well, with the result that `t2`
is modified:

```sql
mysql> EXPLAIN SELECT * FROM t1 AS a1, (SELECT f1(5)) AS a2\G
*************************** 1. row ***************************
           id: 1
  select_type: PRIMARY
        table: <derived2>
   partitions: NULL
         type: system
possible_keys: NULL
          key: NULL
      key_len: NULL
          ref: NULL
         rows: 1
     filtered: 100.00
        Extra: NULL
*************************** 2. row ***************************
           id: 1
  select_type: PRIMARY
        table: a1
   partitions: NULL
         type: ALL
possible_keys: NULL
          key: NULL
      key_len: NULL
          ref: NULL
         rows: 1
     filtered: 100.00
        Extra: NULL
*************************** 3. row ***************************
           id: 2
  select_type: DERIVED
        table: NULL
   partitions: NULL
         type: NULL
possible_keys: NULL
          key: NULL
      key_len: NULL
          ref: NULL
         rows: NULL
     filtered: NULL
        Extra: No tables used
3 rows in set (0.00 sec)

mysql> SELECT * FROM t2;
+------+
| c1   |
+------+
|    5 |
+------+
1 row in set (0.00 sec)
```

The derived table optimization can also be employed with many
correlated (scalar) subqueries (MySQL 8.0.24 and later). For
more information and examples, see
[Section 15.2.15.7, “Correlated Subqueries”](correlated-subqueries.md "15.2.15.7 Correlated Subqueries").
