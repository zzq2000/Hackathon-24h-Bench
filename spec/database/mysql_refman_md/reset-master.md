#### 15.4.1.2 RESET MASTER Statement

Note

This statement is replaced in later versions of MySQL by
`RESET BINARY LOGS AND GTIDS`, and should be
considered deprecated. See
[RESET BINARY LOGS AND GTIDS Statement](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.4/en/reset-binary-logs-and-gtids.html), in
the *MySQL 8.4 Manual*, for more
information.

```sql
RESET MASTER [TO binary_log_file_index_number]
```

Warning

Use this statement with caution to ensure you do not lose any
wanted binary log file data and GTID execution history.

[`RESET MASTER`](reset-master.md "15.4.1.2 RESET MASTER Statement") requires the
[`RELOAD`](privileges-provided.md#priv_reload) privilege.

For a server where binary logging is enabled
([`log_bin`](replication-options-binary-log.md#sysvar_log_bin) is
`ON`), `RESET MASTER` deletes
all existing binary log files and resets the binary log index
file, resetting the server to its state before binary logging
was started. A new empty binary log file is created so that
binary logging can be restarted.

For a server where GTIDs are in use
([`gtid_mode`](replication-options-gtids.md#sysvar_gtid_mode) is
`ON`), issuing `RESET MASTER`
resets the GTID execution history. The value of the
[`gtid_purged`](replication-options-gtids.md#sysvar_gtid_purged) system variable is
set to an empty string (`''`), the global value
(but not the session value) of the
[`gtid_executed`](replication-options-gtids.md#sysvar_gtid_executed) system variable
is set to an empty string, and the
`mysql.gtid_executed` table is cleared (see
[mysql.gtid\_executed Table](replication-gtids-concepts.md#replication-gtids-gtid-executed-table "mysql.gtid_executed Table")). If the
GTID-enabled server has binary logging enabled,
[`RESET MASTER`](reset-master.md "15.4.1.2 RESET MASTER Statement") also resets the
binary log as described above. Note that
[`RESET MASTER`](reset-master.md "15.4.1.2 RESET MASTER Statement") is the method to
reset the GTID execution history even if the GTID-enabled server
is a replica where binary logging is disabled;
[`RESET
REPLICA`](reset-replica.md "15.4.2.4 RESET REPLICA Statement") has no effect on the GTID execution history.
For more information on resetting the GTID execution history,
see [Resetting the GTID Execution History](replication-gtids-lifecycle.md#replication-gtids-execution-history "Resetting the GTID Execution History").

Issuing `RESET MASTER` without the optional
`TO` clause deletes all binary log files listed
in the index file, resets the binary log index file to be empty,
and creates a new binary log file starting at
`1`. Use the optional `TO`
clause to start the binary log file index from a number other
than `1` after the reset.

Check that you are using a reasonable value for the index
number. If you enter an incorrect value, you can correct this by
issuing another [`RESET MASTER`](reset-master.md "15.4.1.2 RESET MASTER Statement")
statement with or without the `TO` clause. If
you do not correct a value that is out of range, the server
cannot be restarted.

The following example demonstrates `TO` clause
usage:

```sql
RESET MASTER TO 1234;

SHOW BINARY LOGS;
+-------------------+-----------+-----------+
| Log_name          | File_size | Encrypted |
+-------------------+-----------+-----------+
| source-bin.001234 |       154 | No        |
+-------------------+-----------+-----------+
```

Important

The effects of [`RESET MASTER`](reset-master.md "15.4.1.2 RESET MASTER Statement")
without the `TO` clause differ from those of
[`PURGE BINARY LOGS`](purge-binary-logs.md "15.4.1.1 PURGE BINARY LOGS Statement") in 2 key
ways:

1. [`RESET MASTER`](reset-master.md "15.4.1.2 RESET MASTER Statement") removes
   *all* binary log files that are listed
   in the index file, leaving only a single, empty binary log
   file with a numeric suffix of `.000001`,
   whereas the numbering is not reset by
   [`PURGE BINARY LOGS`](purge-binary-logs.md "15.4.1.1 PURGE BINARY LOGS Statement").
2. [`RESET MASTER`](reset-master.md "15.4.1.2 RESET MASTER Statement") is
   *not* intended to be used while any
   replicas are running. The behavior of
   [`RESET MASTER`](reset-master.md "15.4.1.2 RESET MASTER Statement") when used
   while replicas are running is undefined (and thus
   unsupported), whereas [`PURGE BINARY
   LOGS`](purge-binary-logs.md "15.4.1.1 PURGE BINARY LOGS Statement") may be safely used while replicas are
   running.

See also [Section 15.4.1.1, “PURGE BINARY LOGS Statement”](purge-binary-logs.md "15.4.1.1 PURGE BINARY LOGS Statement").

[`RESET MASTER`](reset-master.md "15.4.1.2 RESET MASTER Statement") without the
`TO` clause can prove useful when you first set
up a source and replica, so that you can verify the setup as
follows:

1. Start the source and replica, and start replication (see
   [Section 19.1.2, “Setting Up Binary Log File Position Based Replication”](replication-howto.md "19.1.2 Setting Up Binary Log File Position Based Replication")).
2. Execute a few test queries on the source.
3. Check that the queries were replicated to the replica.
4. When replication is running correctly, issue
   [`STOP
   REPLICA`](stop-replica.md "15.4.2.8 STOP REPLICA Statement") followed by
   [`RESET
   REPLICA`](reset-replica.md "15.4.2.4 RESET REPLICA Statement") on the replica, then verify that no
   unwanted data from the test queries exists on the replica.
5. Remove the unwanted data from the source, then issue
   `RESET MASTER` to purge any binary log
   entries and identifiers associated with it.

After verifying the setup, resetting the source and replica and
ensuring that no unwanted data or binary log files generated by
testing remain on the source or replica, you can start the
replica and begin replicating.
