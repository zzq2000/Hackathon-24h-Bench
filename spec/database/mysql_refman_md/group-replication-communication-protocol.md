#### 20.5.1.4 Setting a Group's Communication Protocol Version

From MySQL 8.0.16, Group Replication has the concept of a
communication protocol for the group. The Group Replication
communication protocol version can be managed explicitly, and
set to accommodate the oldest MySQL Server version that you want
the group to support. This enables groups to be formed from
members at different MySQL Server versions while ensuring
backward compatibility.

- Versions from MySQL 5.7.14 allow compression of messages
  (see
  [Section 20.7.4, “Message Compression”](group-replication-message-compression.md "20.7.4 Message Compression")).
- Versions from MySQL 8.0.16 also allow fragmentation of
  messages (see
  [Section 20.7.5, “Message Fragmentation”](group-replication-performance-message-fragmentation.md "20.7.5 Message Fragmentation")).
- Versions from MySQL 8.0.27 also allow the group
  communication engine to operate with a single consensus
  leader when the group is in single-primary mode and
  [`group_replication_paxos_single_leader`](group-replication-system-variables.md#sysvar_group_replication_paxos_single_leader)
  is set to true (see
  [Section 20.7.3, “Single Consensus Leader”](group-replication-single-consensus-leader.md "20.7.3 Single Consensus Leader")).

All members of the group must use the same communication
protocol version, so that group members can be at different
MySQL Server releases but only send messages that can be
understood by all group members.

A MySQL server at version X can only join and reach
`ONLINE` status in a replication group if the
group's communication protocol version is less than or equal to
X. When a new member joins a replication group, it checks the
communication protocol version that is announced by the existing
members of the group. If the joining member supports that
version, it joins the group and uses the communication protocol
that the group has announced, even if the member supports
additional communication capabilities. If the joining member
does not support the communication protocol version, it is
expelled from the group.

If two members attempt to join in the same membership change
event, they can only join if the communication protocol version
for both members is already compatible with the group's
communication protocol version. Members with different
communication protocol versions from the group must join in
isolation. For example:

- One MySQL Server 8.0.16 instance can successfully join a
  group that uses the communication protocol version 5.7.24.
- One MySQL Server 5.7.24 instance cannot successfully join a
  group that uses the communication protocol version 8.0.16.
- Two MySQL Server 8.0.16 instances cannot simultaneously join
  a group that uses the communication protocol version 5.7.24.
- Two MySQL Server 8.0.16 instances can simultaneously join a
  group that uses the communication protocol version 8.0.16.

You can inspect the communication protocol in use by a group by
using the
[`group_replication_get_communication_protocol()`](group-replication-functions-for-communication-protocol.md#function_group-replication-get-communication-protocol)
function, which returns the oldest MySQL Server version that the
group supports. All existing members of the group return the
same communication protocol version. For example:

```sql
SELECT group_replication_get_communication_protocol();
+------------------------------------------------+
| group_replication_get_communication_protocol() |
+------------------------------------------------+
| 8.0.16                                         |
+------------------------------------------------+
```

Note that the
[`group_replication_get_communication_protocol()`](group-replication-functions-for-communication-protocol.md#function_group-replication-get-communication-protocol)
function returns the minimum MySQL version that the group
supports, which might differ from the version number that was
passed to the
[`group_replication_set_communication_protocol()`](group-replication-functions-for-communication-protocol.md#function_group-replication-set-communication-protocol)
function, and from the MySQL Server version that is installed on
the member where you use the function.

If you need to change the communication protocol version of a
group so that members at earlier releases can join, use the
[`group_replication_set_communication_protocol()`](group-replication-functions-for-communication-protocol.md#function_group-replication-set-communication-protocol)
function to specify the MySQL Server version of the oldest
member that you want to allow. This makes the group fall back to
a compatible communication protocol version if possible. The
[`GROUP_REPLICATION_ADMIN`](privileges-provided.md#priv_group-replication-admin) privilege
is required to use this function, and all existing group members
must be online when you issue the statement, with no loss of
majority. For example:

```sql
SELECT group_replication_set_communication_protocol("5.7.25");
```

If you upgrade all the members of a replication group to a new
MySQL Server release, the group's communication protocol version
is not automatically upgraded to match. If you no longer need to
support members at earlier releases, you can use the
[`group_replication_set_communication_protocol()`](group-replication-functions-for-communication-protocol.md#function_group-replication-set-communication-protocol)
function to set the communication protocol version to the new
MySQL Server version to which you have upgraded the members. For
example:

```sql
SELECT group_replication_set_communication_protocol("8.0.16");
```

The
[`group_replication_set_communication_protocol()`](group-replication-functions-for-communication-protocol.md#function_group-replication-set-communication-protocol)
function is implemented as a group action, so it is executed at
the same time on all members of the group. The group action
starts buffering messages and waits for delivery of any outgoing
messages that were already in progress to complete, then changes
the communication protocol version and sends the buffered
messages. If a member attempts to join the group at any time
after you change the communication protocol version, the group
members announce the new protocol version.

MySQL InnoDB cluster automatically and transparently manages the
communication protocol versions of its members, whenever the
cluster topology is changed using AdminAPI operations. An InnoDB
cluster always uses the most recent communication protocol
version that is supported by all the instances that are
currently part of the cluster or joining it. For details, see
[InnoDB Cluster and Group Replication Protocol](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/mysql-shell/8.0/en/monitoring-innodb-cluster.html#innodb-cluster-group-replication-protocol).
