### 2.9.4 Securing the Initial MySQL Account

The MySQL installation process involves initializing the data
directory, including the grant tables in the
`mysql` system schema that define MySQL accounts.
For details, see [Section 2.9.1, “Initializing the Data Directory”](data-directory-initialization.md "2.9.1 Initializing the Data Directory").

This section describes how to assign a password to the initial
`root` account created during the MySQL
installation procedure, if you have not already done so.

Note

Alternative means for performing the process described in this
section:

- On Windows, you can perform the process during installation
  with MySQL Installer (see [Section 2.3.3, “MySQL Installer for Windows”](mysql-installer.md "2.3.3 MySQL Installer for Windows")).
- On all platforms, the MySQL distribution includes
  [**mysql\_secure\_installation**](mysql-secure-installation.md "6.4.2 mysql_secure_installation — Improve MySQL Installation Security"), a command-line
  utility that automates much of the process of securing a
  MySQL installation.
- On all platforms, MySQL Workbench is available and offers the
  ability to manage user accounts (see
  [Chapter 33, *MySQL Workbench*](workbench.md "Chapter 33 MySQL Workbench") ).

A password may already be assigned to the initial account under
these circumstances:

- On Windows, installations performed using MySQL Installer give you the
  option of assigning a password.
- Installation using the macOS installer generates an initial
  random password, which the installer displays to the user in a
  dialog box.
- Installation using RPM packages generates an initial random
  password, which is written to the server error log.
- Installations using Debian packages give you the option of
  assigning a password.
- For data directory initialization performed manually using
  [**mysqld --initialize**](mysqld.md "6.3.1 mysqld — The MySQL Server"),
  [**mysqld**](mysqld.md "6.3.1 mysqld — The MySQL Server") generates an initial random
  password, marks it expired, and writes it to the server error
  log. See [Section 2.9.1, “Initializing the Data Directory”](data-directory-initialization.md "2.9.1 Initializing the Data Directory").

The `mysql.user` grant table defines the initial
MySQL user account and its access privileges. Installation of
MySQL creates only a `'root'@'localhost'`
superuser account that has all privileges and can do anything. If
the `root` account has an empty password, your
MySQL installation is unprotected: Anyone can connect to the MySQL
server as `root` *without a
password* and be granted all privileges.

The `'root'@'localhost'` account also has a row
in the `mysql.proxies_priv` table that enables
granting the [`PROXY`](privileges-provided.md#priv_proxy) privilege for
`''@''`, that is, for all users and all hosts.
This enables `root` to set up proxy users, as
well as to delegate to other accounts the authority to set up
proxy users. See [Section 8.2.19, “Proxy Users”](proxy-users.md "8.2.19 Proxy Users").

To assign a password for the initial MySQL `root`
account, use the following procedure. Replace
*`root-password`* in the examples with the
password that you want to use.

Start the server if it is not running. For instructions, see
[Section 2.9.2, “Starting the Server”](starting-server.md "2.9.2 Starting the Server").

The initial `root` account may or may not have a
password. Choose whichever of the following procedures applies:

- If the `root` account exists with an initial
  random password that has been expired, connect to the server
  as `root` using that password, then choose a
  new password. This is the case if the data directory was
  initialized using [**mysqld --initialize**](mysqld.md "6.3.1 mysqld — The MySQL Server"),
  either manually or using an installer that does not give you
  the option of specifying a password during the install
  operation. Because the password exists, you must use it to
  connect to the server. But because the password is expired,
  you cannot use the account for any purpose other than to
  choose a new password, until you do choose one.

  1. If you do not know the initial random password, look in
     the server error log.
  2. Connect to the server as `root` using the
     password:

     ```terminal
     $> mysql -u root -p
     Enter password: (enter the random root password here)
     ```
  3. Choose a new password to replace the random password:

     ```sql
     mysql> ALTER USER 'root'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'root-password';
     ```
- If the `root` account exists but has no
  password, connect to the server as `root`
  using no password, then assign a password. This is the case if
  you initialized the data directory using [**mysqld
  --initialize-insecure**](mysqld.md "6.3.1 mysqld — The MySQL Server").

  1. Connect to the server as `root` using no
     password:

     ```terminal
     $> mysql -u root --skip-password
     ```
  2. Assign a password:

     ```sql
     mysql> ALTER USER 'root'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'root-password';
     ```

After assigning the `root` account a password,
you must supply that password whenever you connect to the server
using the account. For example, to connect to the server using the
[**mysql**](mysql.md "6.5.1 mysql — The MySQL Command-Line Client") client, use this command:

```terminal
$> mysql -u root -p
Enter password: (enter root password here)
```

To shut down the server with [**mysqladmin**](mysqladmin.md "6.5.2 mysqladmin — A MySQL Server Administration Program"), use
this command:

```sql
$> mysqladmin -u root -p shutdown
Enter password: (enter root password here)
```

Note

For additional information about setting passwords, see
[Section 8.2.14, “Assigning Account Passwords”](assigning-passwords.md "8.2.14 Assigning Account Passwords"). If you forget your
`root` password after setting it, see
[Section B.3.3.2, “How to Reset the Root Password”](resetting-permissions.md "B.3.3.2 How to Reset the Root Password").

To set up additional accounts, see
[Section 8.2.8, “Adding Accounts, Assigning Privileges, and Dropping Accounts”](creating-accounts.md "8.2.8 Adding Accounts, Assigning Privileges, and Dropping Accounts").
