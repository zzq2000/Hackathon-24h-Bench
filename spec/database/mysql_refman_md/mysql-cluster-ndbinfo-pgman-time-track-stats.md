#### 25.6.16.49 The ndbinfo pgman\_time\_track\_stats Table

This table provides information regarding the latency of disk
operations for NDB Cluster Disk Data tablespaces.

The `pgman_time_track_stats` table contains the
following columns:

- `node_id`

  Unique node ID of this node in the cluster
- `block_number`

  Block number (from [`blocks`](mysql-cluster-ndbinfo-blocks.md "25.6.16.5 The ndbinfo blocks Table")
  table)
- `block_instance`

  Block instance number
- `upper_bound`

  Upper bound
- `page_reads`

  Page read latency (ms)
- `page_writes`

  Page write latency (ms)
- `log_waits`

  Log wait latency (ms)
- `get_page`

  Latency of `get_page()` calls (ms)

##### Notes

The read latency (`page_reads` column) measures
the time from when the read request is sent to the file system
thread until the read is complete and has been reported back to
the execution thread. The write latency
(`page_writes`) is calculated in a similar
fashion. The size of the page read to or written from a Disk
Data tablespace is always 32 KB.

Log wait latency (`log_waits` column) is the
length of time a page write must wait for the undo log to be
flushed, which must be done prior to each page write.
