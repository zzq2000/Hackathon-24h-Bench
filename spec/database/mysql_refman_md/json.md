MySQL supports a native `JSON` (JavaScript Object
Notation) data type defined by
[RFC
8259](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc8259) that enables efficient access to data in JSON
documents. The `JSON` data type provides these
advantages over storing JSON-format strings in a string column:

- Automatic validation of JSON documents stored in
  `JSON` columns. Invalid documents produce an
  error.
- Optimized storage format. JSON documents stored in
  `JSON` columns are converted to an internal
  format that permits quick read access to document elements.
  When the server later must read a JSON value stored in this
  binary format, the value need not be parsed from a text
  representation. The binary format is structured to enable the
  server to look up subobjects or nested values directly by key
  or array index without reading all values before or after them
  in the document.

MySQL also supports the *JSON Merge Patch*
format defined in
[RFC
7396](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7396), using the
[`JSON_MERGE_PATCH()`](json-modification-functions.md#function_json-merge-patch) function. See
the description of this function, as well as
[Normalization, Merging, and Autowrapping of JSON Values](json.md#json-normalization "Normalization, Merging, and Autowrapping of JSON Values"), for examples and further
information.

Note

This discussion uses `JSON` in monotype to
indicate specifically the JSON data type and “JSON”
in regular font to indicate JSON data in general.

The space required to store a `JSON` document is
roughly the same as for [`LONGBLOB`](blob.md "13.3.4 The BLOB and TEXT Types") or
[`LONGTEXT`](blob.md "13.3.4 The BLOB and TEXT Types"); see
[Section 13.7, “Data Type Storage Requirements”](storage-requirements.md "13.7 Data Type Storage Requirements"), for more information. It
is important to keep in mind that the size of any JSON document
stored in a `JSON` column is limited to the value
of the [`max_allowed_packet`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_max_allowed_packet) system
variable. (When the server is manipulating a JSON value internally
in memory, it can be larger than this; the limit applies when the
server stores it.) You can obtain the amount of space required to
store a JSON document using the
[`JSON_STORAGE_SIZE()`](json-utility-functions.md#function_json-storage-size) function; note
that for a [`JSON`](json.md "13.5 The JSON Data Type") column, the storage
size—and thus the value returned by this function—is
that used by the column prior to any partial updates that may have
been performed on it (see the discussion of the JSON partial
update optimization later in this section).

Prior to MySQL 8.0.13, a `JSON` column cannot
have a non-`NULL` default value.

Along with the `JSON` data type, a set of SQL
functions is available to enable operations on JSON values, such
as creation, manipulation, and searching. The following discussion
shows examples of these operations. For details about individual
functions, see [Section 14.17, “JSON Functions”](json-functions.md "14.17 JSON Functions").

A set of spatial functions for operating on GeoJSON values is also
available. See [Section 14.16.11, “Spatial GeoJSON Functions”](spatial-geojson-functions.md "14.16.11 Spatial GeoJSON Functions").

`JSON` columns, like columns of other binary
types, are not indexed directly; instead, you can create an index
on a generated column that extracts a scalar value from the
`JSON` column. See
[Indexing a Generated Column to Provide a JSON Column Index](create-table-secondary-indexes.md#json-column-indirect-index "Indexing a Generated Column to Provide a JSON Column Index"), for a detailed
example.

The MySQL optimizer also looks for compatible indexes on virtual
columns that match JSON expressions.

In MySQL 8.0.17 and later, the [`InnoDB`](innodb-storage-engine.md "Chapter 17 The InnoDB Storage Engine")
storage engine supports multi-valued indexes on JSON arrays. See
[Multi-Valued Indexes](create-index.md#create-index-multi-valued "Multi-Valued Indexes").

MySQL NDB Cluster 8.0 supports `JSON` columns and
MySQL JSON functions, including creation of an index on a column
generated from a `JSON` column as a workaround
for being unable to index a `JSON` column. A
maximum of 3 `JSON` columns per
[`NDB`](mysql-cluster.md "Chapter 25 MySQL NDB Cluster 8.0") table is supported.

### Partial Updates of JSON Values

In MySQL 8.0, the optimizer can perform a partial,
in-place update of a `JSON` column instead of
removing the old document and writing the new document in its
entirety to the column. This optimization can be performed for an
update that meets the following conditions:

- The column being updated was declared as
  `JSON`.
- The [`UPDATE`](update.md "15.2.17 UPDATE Statement") statement uses any
  of the three functions
  [`JSON_SET()`](json-modification-functions.md#function_json-set),
  [`JSON_REPLACE()`](json-modification-functions.md#function_json-replace), or
  [`JSON_REMOVE()`](json-modification-functions.md#function_json-remove) to update the
  column. A direct assignment of the column value (for example,
  `UPDATE mytable SET jcol = '{"a": 10, "b":
  25}'`) cannot be performed as a partial update.

  Updates of multiple `JSON` columns in a
  single `UPDATE` statement can be optimized in
  this fashion; MySQL can perform partial updates of only those
  columns whose values are updated using the three functions
  just listed.
- The input column and the target column must be the same
  column; a statement such as `UPDATE mytable SET jcol1
  = JSON_SET(jcol2, '$.a', 100)` cannot be performed as
  a partial update.

  The update can use nested calls to any of the functions listed
  in the previous item, in any combination, as long as the input
  and target columns are the same.
- All changes replace existing array or object values with new
  ones, and do not add any new elements to the parent object or
  array.
- The value being replaced must be at least as large as the
  replacement value. In other words, the new value cannot be any
  larger than the old one.

  A possible exception to this requirement occurs when a
  previous partial update has left sufficient space for the
  larger value. You can use the function
  [`JSON_STORAGE_FREE()`](json-utility-functions.md#function_json-storage-free) see how
  much space has been freed by any partial updates of a
  `JSON` column.

Such partial updates can be written to the binary log using a
compact format that saves space; this can be enabled by setting
the [`binlog_row_value_options`](replication-options-binary-log.md#sysvar_binlog_row_value_options)
system variable to `PARTIAL_JSON`.

It is important to distinguish the partial update of a
`JSON` column value stored in a table from
writing the partial update of a row to the binary log. It is
possible for the complete update of a `JSON`
column to be recorded in the binary log as a partial update. This
can happen when either (or both) of the last two conditions from
the previous list is not met but the other conditions are
satisfied.

See also the description of
[`binlog_row_value_options`](replication-options-binary-log.md#sysvar_binlog_row_value_options).

The next few sections provide basic information regarding the
creation and manipulation of JSON values.

### Creating JSON Values

A JSON array contains a list of values separated by commas and
enclosed within `[` and `]`
characters:

```json
["abc", 10, null, true, false]
```

A JSON object contains a set of key-value pairs separated by
commas and enclosed within `{` and
`}` characters:

```json
{"k1": "value", "k2": 10}
```

As the examples illustrate, JSON arrays and objects can contain
scalar values that are strings or numbers, the JSON null
literal, or the JSON boolean true or false literals. Keys in
JSON objects must be strings. Temporal (date, time, or datetime)
scalar values are also permitted:

```json
["12:18:29.000000", "2015-07-29", "2015-07-29 12:18:29.000000"]
```

Nesting is permitted within JSON array elements and JSON object
key values:

```json
[99, {"id": "HK500", "cost": 75.99}, ["hot", "cold"]]
{"k1": "value", "k2": [10, 20]}
```

You can also obtain JSON values from a number of functions
supplied by MySQL for this purpose (see
[Section 14.17.2, “Functions That Create JSON Values”](json-creation-functions.md "14.17.2 Functions That Create JSON Values")) as well as by casting
values of other types to the `JSON` type using
[`CAST(value AS
JSON)`](cast-functions.md#function_cast) (see
[Converting between JSON and non-JSON values](json.md#json-converting-between-types "Converting between JSON and non-JSON values")). The next
several paragraphs describe how MySQL handles JSON values
provided as input.

In MySQL, JSON values are written as strings. MySQL parses any
string used in a context that requires a JSON value, and
produces an error if it is not valid as JSON. These contexts
include inserting a value into a column that has the
`JSON` data type and passing an argument to a
function that expects a JSON value (usually shown as
*`json_doc`* or
*`json_val`* in the documentation for
MySQL JSON functions), as the following examples demonstrate:

- Attempting to insert a value into a `JSON`
  column succeeds if the value is a valid JSON value, but
  fails if it is not:

  ```sql
  mysql> CREATE TABLE t1 (jdoc JSON);
  Query OK, 0 rows affected (0.20 sec)

  mysql> INSERT INTO t1 VALUES('{"key1": "value1", "key2": "value2"}');
  Query OK, 1 row affected (0.01 sec)

  mysql> INSERT INTO t1 VALUES('[1, 2,');
  ERROR 3140 (22032) at line 2: Invalid JSON text:
  "Invalid value." at position 6 in value (or column) '[1, 2,'.
  ```

  Positions for “at position
  *`N`*” in such error messages
  are 0-based, but should be considered rough indications of
  where the problem in a value actually occurs.
- The [`JSON_TYPE()`](json-attribute-functions.md#function_json-type) function
  expects a JSON argument and attempts to parse it into a JSON
  value. It returns the value's JSON type if it is valid
  and produces an error otherwise:

  ```sql
  mysql> SELECT JSON_TYPE('["a", "b", 1]');
  +----------------------------+
  | JSON_TYPE('["a", "b", 1]') |
  +----------------------------+
  | ARRAY                      |
  +----------------------------+

  mysql> SELECT JSON_TYPE('"hello"');
  +----------------------+
  | JSON_TYPE('"hello"') |
  +----------------------+
  | STRING               |
  +----------------------+

  mysql> SELECT JSON_TYPE('hello');
  ERROR 3146 (22032): Invalid data type for JSON data in argument 1
  to function json_type; a JSON string or JSON type is required.
  ```

MySQL handles strings used in JSON context using the
`utf8mb4` character set and
`utf8mb4_bin` collation. Strings in other
character sets are converted to `utf8mb4` as
necessary. (For strings in the `ascii` or
`utf8mb3` character sets, no conversion is
needed because `ascii` and
`utf8mb3` are subsets of
`utf8mb4`.)

As an alternative to writing JSON values using literal strings,
functions exist for composing JSON values from component
elements. [`JSON_ARRAY()`](json-creation-functions.md#function_json-array) takes a
(possibly empty) list of values and returns a JSON array
containing those values:

```sql
mysql> SELECT JSON_ARRAY('a', 1, NOW());
+----------------------------------------+
| JSON_ARRAY('a', 1, NOW())              |
+----------------------------------------+
| ["a", 1, "2015-07-27 09:43:47.000000"] |
+----------------------------------------+
```

[`JSON_OBJECT()`](json-creation-functions.md#function_json-object) takes a (possibly
empty) list of key-value pairs and returns a JSON object
containing those pairs:

```sql
mysql> SELECT JSON_OBJECT('key1', 1, 'key2', 'abc');
+---------------------------------------+
| JSON_OBJECT('key1', 1, 'key2', 'abc') |
+---------------------------------------+
| {"key1": 1, "key2": "abc"}            |
+---------------------------------------+
```

[`JSON_MERGE_PRESERVE()`](json-modification-functions.md#function_json-merge-preserve) takes two
or more JSON documents and returns the combined result:

```sql
mysql> SELECT JSON_MERGE_PRESERVE('["a", 1]', '{"key": "value"}');
+-----------------------------------------------------+
| JSON_MERGE_PRESERVE('["a", 1]', '{"key": "value"}') |
+-----------------------------------------------------+
| ["a", 1, {"key": "value"}]                          |
+-----------------------------------------------------+
1 row in set (0.00 sec)
```

For information about the merging rules, see
[Normalization, Merging, and Autowrapping of JSON Values](json.md#json-normalization "Normalization, Merging, and Autowrapping of JSON Values").

(MySQL 8.0.3 and later also support
[`JSON_MERGE_PATCH()`](json-modification-functions.md#function_json-merge-patch), which has
somewhat different behavior. See
[JSON\_MERGE\_PATCH() compared with JSON\_MERGE\_PRESERVE()](json-modification-functions.md#json-merge-patch-json-merge-preserve-compared "JSON_MERGE_PATCH() compared with JSON_MERGE_PRESERVE()"),
for information about the differences between these two
functions.)

JSON values can be assigned to user-defined variables:

```sql
mysql> SET @j = JSON_OBJECT('key', 'value');
mysql> SELECT @j;
+------------------+
| @j               |
+------------------+
| {"key": "value"} |
+------------------+
```

However, user-defined variables cannot be of
`JSON` data type, so although
`@j` in the preceding example looks like a JSON
value and has the same character set and collation as a JSON
value, it does *not* have the
`JSON` data type. Instead, the result from
[`JSON_OBJECT()`](json-creation-functions.md#function_json-object) is converted to a
string when assigned to the variable.

Strings produced by converting JSON values have a character set
of `utf8mb4` and a collation of
`utf8mb4_bin`:

```sql
mysql> SELECT CHARSET(@j), COLLATION(@j);
+-------------+---------------+
| CHARSET(@j) | COLLATION(@j) |
+-------------+---------------+
| utf8mb4     | utf8mb4_bin   |
+-------------+---------------+
```

Because `utf8mb4_bin` is a binary collation,
comparison of JSON values is case-sensitive.

```sql
mysql> SELECT JSON_ARRAY('x') = JSON_ARRAY('X');
+-----------------------------------+
| JSON_ARRAY('x') = JSON_ARRAY('X') |
+-----------------------------------+
|                                 0 |
+-----------------------------------+
```

Case sensitivity also applies to the JSON
`null`, `true`, and
`false` literals, which always must be written
in lowercase:

```sql
mysql> SELECT JSON_VALID('null'), JSON_VALID('Null'), JSON_VALID('NULL');
+--------------------+--------------------+--------------------+
| JSON_VALID('null') | JSON_VALID('Null') | JSON_VALID('NULL') |
+--------------------+--------------------+--------------------+
|                  1 |                  0 |                  0 |
+--------------------+--------------------+--------------------+

mysql> SELECT CAST('null' AS JSON);
+----------------------+
| CAST('null' AS JSON) |
+----------------------+
| null                 |
+----------------------+
1 row in set (0.00 sec)

mysql> SELECT CAST('NULL' AS JSON);
ERROR 3141 (22032): Invalid JSON text in argument 1 to function cast_as_json:
"Invalid value." at position 0 in 'NULL'.
```

Case sensitivity of the JSON literals differs from that of the
SQL `NULL`, `TRUE`, and
`FALSE` literals, which can be written in any
lettercase:

```sql
mysql> SELECT ISNULL(null), ISNULL(Null), ISNULL(NULL);
+--------------+--------------+--------------+
| ISNULL(null) | ISNULL(Null) | ISNULL(NULL) |
+--------------+--------------+--------------+
|            1 |            1 |            1 |
+--------------+--------------+--------------+
```

Sometimes it may be necessary or desirable to insert quote
characters (`"` or `'`) into a
JSON document. Assume for this example that you want to insert
some JSON objects containing strings representing sentences that
state some facts about MySQL, each paired with an appropriate
keyword, into a table created using the SQL statement shown
here:

```sql
mysql> CREATE TABLE facts (sentence JSON);
```

Among these keyword-sentence pairs is this one:

```simple
mascot: The MySQL mascot is a dolphin named "Sakila".
```

One way to insert this as a JSON object into the
`facts` table is to use the MySQL
[`JSON_OBJECT()`](json-creation-functions.md#function_json-object) function. In this
case, you must escape each quote character using a backslash, as
shown here:

```sql
mysql> INSERT INTO facts VALUES
     >   (JSON_OBJECT("mascot", "Our mascot is a dolphin named \"Sakila\"."));
```

This does not work in the same way if you insert the value as a
JSON object literal, in which case, you must use the double
backslash escape sequence, like this:

```sql
mysql> INSERT INTO facts VALUES
     >   ('{"mascot": "Our mascot is a dolphin named \\"Sakila\\"."}');
```

Using the double backslash keeps MySQL from performing escape
sequence processing, and instead causes it to pass the string
literal to the storage engine for processing. After inserting
the JSON object in either of the ways just shown, you can see
that the backslashes are present in the JSON column value by
doing a simple [`SELECT`](select.md "15.2.13 SELECT Statement"), like this:

```sql
mysql> SELECT sentence FROM facts;
+---------------------------------------------------------+
| sentence                                                |
+---------------------------------------------------------+
| {"mascot": "Our mascot is a dolphin named \"Sakila\"."} |
+---------------------------------------------------------+
```

To look up this particular sentence employing
`mascot` as the key, you can use the
column-path operator
[`->`](json-search-functions.md#operator_json-column-path),
as shown here:

```sql
mysql> SELECT col->"$.mascot" FROM qtest;
+---------------------------------------------+
| col->"$.mascot"                             |
+---------------------------------------------+
| "Our mascot is a dolphin named \"Sakila\"." |
+---------------------------------------------+
1 row in set (0.00 sec)
```

This leaves the backslashes intact, along with the surrounding
quote marks. To display the desired value using
`mascot` as the key, but without including the
surrounding quote marks or any escapes, use the inline path
operator
[`->>`](json-search-functions.md#operator_json-inline-path),
like this:

```sql
mysql> SELECT sentence->>"$.mascot" FROM facts;
+-----------------------------------------+
| sentence->>"$.mascot"                   |
+-----------------------------------------+
| Our mascot is a dolphin named "Sakila". |
+-----------------------------------------+
```

Note

The previous example does not work as shown if the
[`NO_BACKSLASH_ESCAPES`](sql-mode.md#sqlmode_no_backslash_escapes) server
SQL mode is enabled. If this mode is set, a single backslash
instead of double backslashes can be used to insert the JSON
object literal, and the backslashes are preserved. If you use
the `JSON_OBJECT()` function when performing
the insert and this mode is set, you must alternate single and
double quotes, like this:

```sql
mysql> INSERT INTO facts VALUES
     > (JSON_OBJECT('mascot', 'Our mascot is a dolphin named "Sakila".'));
```

See the description of the
[`JSON_UNQUOTE()`](json-modification-functions.md#function_json-unquote) function for
more information about the effects of this mode on escaped
characters in JSON values.

### Normalization, Merging, and Autowrapping of JSON Values

When a string is parsed and found to be a valid JSON document,
it is also normalized. This means that members with keys that
duplicate a key found later in the document, reading from left
to right, are discarded. The object value produced by the
following [`JSON_OBJECT()`](json-creation-functions.md#function_json-object) call
includes only the second `key1` element because
that key name occurs earlier in the value, as shown here:

```sql
mysql> SELECT JSON_OBJECT('key1', 1, 'key2', 'abc', 'key1', 'def');
+------------------------------------------------------+
| JSON_OBJECT('key1', 1, 'key2', 'abc', 'key1', 'def') |
+------------------------------------------------------+
| {"key1": "def", "key2": "abc"}                       |
+------------------------------------------------------+
```

Normalization is also performed when values are inserted into
JSON columns, as shown here:

```sql
mysql> CREATE TABLE t1 (c1 JSON);

mysql> INSERT INTO t1 VALUES
     >     ('{"x": 17, "x": "red"}'),
     >     ('{"x": 17, "x": "red", "x": [3, 5, 7]}');

mysql> SELECT c1 FROM t1;
+------------------+
| c1               |
+------------------+
| {"x": "red"}     |
| {"x": [3, 5, 7]} |
+------------------+
```

This “last duplicate key wins” behavior is
suggested by
[RFC
7159](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7159) and is implemented by most JavaScript parsers. (Bug
#86866, Bug #26369555)

In versions of MySQL prior to 8.0.3, members with keys that
duplicated a key found earlier in the document were discarded.
The object value produced by the following
[`JSON_OBJECT()`](json-creation-functions.md#function_json-object) call does not
include the second `key1` element because that
key name occurs earlier in the value:

```sql
mysql> SELECT JSON_OBJECT('key1', 1, 'key2', 'abc', 'key1', 'def');
+------------------------------------------------------+
| JSON_OBJECT('key1', 1, 'key2', 'abc', 'key1', 'def') |
+------------------------------------------------------+
| {"key1": 1, "key2": "abc"}                           |
+------------------------------------------------------+
```

Prior to MySQL 8.0.3, this “first duplicate key
wins” normalization was also performed when inserting
values into JSON columns.

```sql
mysql> CREATE TABLE t1 (c1 JSON);

mysql> INSERT INTO t1 VALUES
     >     ('{"x": 17, "x": "red"}'),
     >     ('{"x": 17, "x": "red", "x": [3, 5, 7]}');

mysql> SELECT c1 FROM t1;
+-----------+
| c1        |
+-----------+
| {"x": 17} |
| {"x": 17} |
+-----------+
```

MySQL also discards extra whitespace between keys, values, or
elements in the original JSON document, and leaves (or inserts,
when necessary) a single space following each comma
(`,`) or colon (`:`) when
displaying it. This is done to enhance readability.

MySQL functions that produce JSON values (see
[Section 14.17.2, “Functions That Create JSON Values”](json-creation-functions.md "14.17.2 Functions That Create JSON Values")) always return
normalized values.

To make lookups more efficient, MySQL also sorts the keys of a
JSON object. *You should be aware that the result of
this ordering is subject to change and not guaranteed to be
consistent across releases*.

#### Merging JSON Values

Two merging algorithms are supported in MySQL 8.0.3 (and later),
implemented by the functions
[`JSON_MERGE_PRESERVE()`](json-modification-functions.md#function_json-merge-preserve) and
[`JSON_MERGE_PATCH()`](json-modification-functions.md#function_json-merge-patch). These differ
in how they handle duplicate keys:
[`JSON_MERGE_PRESERVE()`](json-modification-functions.md#function_json-merge-preserve) retains
values for duplicate keys, while
[`JSON_MERGE_PATCH()`](json-modification-functions.md#function_json-merge-patch) discards all
but the last value. The next few paragraphs explain how each of
these two functions handles the merging of different
combinations of JSON documents (that is, of objects and arrays).

Note

[`JSON_MERGE_PRESERVE()`](json-modification-functions.md#function_json-merge-preserve) is the
same as the `JSON_MERGE()` function found in
previous versions of MySQL (renamed in MySQL 8.0.3).
`JSON_MERGE()` is still supported as an alias
for `JSON_MERGE_PRESERVE()` in MySQL
8.0, but is deprecated and subject to removal in
a future release.

**Merging arrays.**
In contexts that combine multiple arrays, the arrays are
merged into a single array.
`JSON_MERGE_PRESERVE()` does this by
concatenating arrays named later to the end of the first
array. `JSON_MERGE_PATCH()` considers each
argument as an array consisting of a single element (thus
having 0 as its index) and then applies “last duplicate
key wins” logic to select only the last argument. You
can compare the results shown by this query:

```sql
mysql> SELECT
    ->   JSON_MERGE_PRESERVE('[1, 2]', '["a", "b", "c"]', '[true, false]') AS Preserve,
    ->   JSON_MERGE_PATCH('[1, 2]', '["a", "b", "c"]', '[true, false]') AS Patch\G
*************************** 1. row ***************************
Preserve: [1, 2, "a", "b", "c", true, false]
   Patch: [true, false]
```

Multiple objects when merged produce a single object.
`JSON_MERGE_PRESERVE()` handles multiple
objects having the same key by combining all unique values for
that key in an array; this array is then used as the value for
that key in the result. `JSON_MERGE_PATCH()`
discards values for which duplicate keys are found, working from
left to right, so that the result contains only the last value
for that key. The following query illustrates the difference in
the results for the duplicate key `a`:

```sql
mysql> SELECT
    ->   JSON_MERGE_PRESERVE('{"a": 1, "b": 2}', '{"c": 3, "a": 4}', '{"c": 5, "d": 3}') AS Preserve,
    ->   JSON_MERGE_PATCH('{"a": 3, "b": 2}', '{"c": 3, "a": 4}', '{"c": 5, "d": 3}') AS Patch\G
*************************** 1. row ***************************
Preserve: {"a": [1, 4], "b": 2, "c": [3, 5], "d": 3}
   Patch: {"a": 4, "b": 2, "c": 5, "d": 3}
```

Nonarray values used in a context that requires an array value
are autowrapped: The value is surrounded by `[`
and `]` characters to convert it to an array.
In the following statement, each argument is autowrapped as an
array (`[1]`, `[2]`). These
are then merged to produce a single result array; as in the
previous two cases, `JSON_MERGE_PRESERVE()`
combines values having the same key while
`JSON_MERGE_PATCH()` discards values for all
duplicate keys except the last, as shown here:

```sql
mysql> SELECT
	  ->   JSON_MERGE_PRESERVE('1', '2') AS Preserve,
	  ->   JSON_MERGE_PATCH('1', '2') AS Patch\G
*************************** 1. row ***************************
Preserve: [1, 2]
   Patch: 2
```

Array and object values are merged by autowrapping the object as
an array and merging the arrays by combining values or by
“last duplicate key wins” according to the choice
of merging function (`JSON_MERGE_PRESERVE()` or
`JSON_MERGE_PATCH()`, respectively), as can be
seen in this example:

```sql
mysql> SELECT
	  ->   JSON_MERGE_PRESERVE('[10, 20]', '{"a": "x", "b": "y"}') AS Preserve,
	  ->   JSON_MERGE_PATCH('[10, 20]', '{"a": "x", "b": "y"}') AS Patch\G
*************************** 1. row ***************************
Preserve: [10, 20, {"a": "x", "b": "y"}]
   Patch: {"a": "x", "b": "y"}
```

### Searching and Modifying JSON Values

A JSON path expression selects a value within a JSON document.

Path expressions are useful with functions that extract parts of
or modify a JSON document, to specify where within that document
to operate. For example, the following query extracts from a
JSON document the value of the member with the
`name` key:

```sql
mysql> SELECT JSON_EXTRACT('{"id": 14, "name": "Aztalan"}', '$.name');
+---------------------------------------------------------+
| JSON_EXTRACT('{"id": 14, "name": "Aztalan"}', '$.name') |
+---------------------------------------------------------+
| "Aztalan"                                               |
+---------------------------------------------------------+
```

Path syntax uses a leading `$` character to
represent the JSON document under consideration, optionally
followed by selectors that indicate successively more specific
parts of the document:

- A period followed by a key name names the member in an
  object with the given key. The key name must be specified
  within double quotation marks if the name without quotes is
  not legal within path expressions (for example, if it
  contains a space).
- `[N]` appended
  to a *`path`* that selects an array
  names the value at position *`N`*
  within the array. Array positions are integers beginning
  with zero. If *`path`* does not
  select an array value, *`path`*[0]
  evaluates to the same value as
  *`path`*:

  ```sql
  mysql> SELECT JSON_SET('"x"', '$[0]', 'a');
  +------------------------------+
  | JSON_SET('"x"', '$[0]', 'a') |
  +------------------------------+
  | "a"                          |
  +------------------------------+
  1 row in set (0.00 sec)
  ```
- `[M to
  N]` specifies a subset
  or range of array values starting with the value at position
  *`M`*, and ending with the value at
  position *`N`*.

  `last` is supported as a synonym for the
  index of the rightmost array element. Relative addressing of
  array elements is also supported. If
  *`path`* does not select an array
  value, *`path`*[last] evaluates to
  the same value as *`path`*, as shown
  later in this section (see
  [Rightmost array element](json.md#json-paths-last "Rightmost array element")).
- Paths can contain `*` or
  `**` wildcards:

  - `.[*]` evaluates to the values of all
    members in a JSON object.
  - `[*]` evaluates to the values of all
    elements in a JSON array.
  - `prefix**suffix`
    evaluates to all paths that begin with the named prefix
    and end with the named suffix.
- A path that does not exist in the document (evaluates to
  nonexistent data) evaluates to `NULL`.

Let `$` refer to this JSON array with three
elements:

```json
[3, {"a": [5, 6], "b": 10}, [99, 100]]
```

Then:

- `$[0]` evaluates to `3`.
- `$[1]` evaluates to `{"a": [5, 6],
  "b": 10}`.
- `$[2]` evaluates to `[99,
  100]`.
- `$[3]` evaluates to `NULL`
  (it refers to the fourth array element, which does not
  exist).

Because `$[1]` and `$[2]`
evaluate to nonscalar values, they can be used as the basis for
more-specific path expressions that select nested values.
Examples:

- `$[1].a` evaluates to `[5,
  6]`.
- `$[1].a[1]` evaluates to
  `6`.
- `$[1].b` evaluates to
  `10`.
- `$[2][0]` evaluates to
  `99`.

As mentioned previously, path components that name keys must be
quoted if the unquoted key name is not legal in path
expressions. Let `$` refer to this value:

```json
{"a fish": "shark", "a bird": "sparrow"}
```

The keys both contain a space and must be quoted:

- `$."a fish"` evaluates to
  `shark`.
- `$."a bird"` evaluates to
  `sparrow`.

Paths that use wildcards evaluate to an array that can contain
multiple values:

```sql
mysql> SELECT JSON_EXTRACT('{"a": 1, "b": 2, "c": [3, 4, 5]}', '$.*');
+---------------------------------------------------------+
| JSON_EXTRACT('{"a": 1, "b": 2, "c": [3, 4, 5]}', '$.*') |
+---------------------------------------------------------+
| [1, 2, [3, 4, 5]]                                       |
+---------------------------------------------------------+
mysql> SELECT JSON_EXTRACT('{"a": 1, "b": 2, "c": [3, 4, 5]}', '$.c[*]');
+------------------------------------------------------------+
| JSON_EXTRACT('{"a": 1, "b": 2, "c": [3, 4, 5]}', '$.c[*]') |
+------------------------------------------------------------+
| [3, 4, 5]                                                  |
+------------------------------------------------------------+
```

In the following example, the path `$**.b`
evaluates to multiple paths (`$.a.b` and
`$.c.b`) and produces an array of the matching
path values:

```sql
mysql> SELECT JSON_EXTRACT('{"a": {"b": 1}, "c": {"b": 2}}', '$**.b');
+---------------------------------------------------------+
| JSON_EXTRACT('{"a": {"b": 1}, "c": {"b": 2}}', '$**.b') |
+---------------------------------------------------------+
| [1, 2]                                                  |
+---------------------------------------------------------+
```

**Ranges from JSON arrays.**
You can use ranges with the `to` keyword to
specify subsets of JSON arrays. For example, `$[1 to
3]` includes the second, third, and fourth elements
of an array, as shown here:

```sql
mysql> SELECT JSON_EXTRACT('[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]', '$[1 to 3]');
+----------------------------------------------+
| JSON_EXTRACT('[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]', '$[1 to 3]') |
+----------------------------------------------+
| [2, 3, 4]                                    |
+----------------------------------------------+
1 row in set (0.00 sec)
```

The syntax is `M to
N`, where
*`M`* and *`N`*
are, respectively, the first and last indexes of a range of
elements from a JSON array. *`N`* must be
greater than *`M`*;
*`M`* must be greater than or equal to 0.
Array elements are indexed beginning with 0.

You can use ranges in contexts where wildcards are supported.

**Rightmost array element.**
The `last` keyword is supported as a synonym
for the index of the last element in an array. Expressions of
the form `last -
N` can be used for
relative addressing, and within range definitions, like this:

```sql
mysql> SELECT JSON_EXTRACT('[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]', '$[last-3 to last-1]');
+--------------------------------------------------------+
| JSON_EXTRACT('[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]', '$[last-3 to last-1]') |
+--------------------------------------------------------+
| [2, 3, 4]                                              |
+--------------------------------------------------------+
1 row in set (0.01 sec)
```

If the path is evaluated against a value that is not an array,
the result of the evaluation is the same as if the value had
been wrapped in a single-element array:

```sql
mysql> SELECT JSON_REPLACE('"Sakila"', '$[last]', 10);
+-----------------------------------------+
| JSON_REPLACE('"Sakila"', '$[last]', 10) |
+-----------------------------------------+
| 10                                      |
+-----------------------------------------+
1 row in set (0.00 sec)
```

You can use
[`column->path`](json-search-functions.md#operator_json-column-path)
with a JSON column identifier and JSON path expression as a
synonym for
[`JSON_EXTRACT(column,
path)`](json-search-functions.md#function_json-extract). See
[Section 14.17.3, “Functions That Search JSON Values”](json-search-functions.md "14.17.3 Functions That Search JSON Values"), for more information.
See also [Indexing a Generated Column to Provide a JSON Column Index](create-table-secondary-indexes.md#json-column-indirect-index "Indexing a Generated Column to Provide a JSON Column Index").

Some functions take an existing JSON document, modify it in some
way, and return the resulting modified document. Path
expressions indicate where in the document to make changes. For
example, the [`JSON_SET()`](json-modification-functions.md#function_json-set),
[`JSON_INSERT()`](json-modification-functions.md#function_json-insert), and
[`JSON_REPLACE()`](json-modification-functions.md#function_json-replace) functions each
take a JSON document, plus one or more path-value pairs that
describe where to modify the document and the values to use. The
functions differ in how they handle existing and nonexisting
values within the document.

Consider this document:

```sql
mysql> SET @j = '["a", {"b": [true, false]}, [10, 20]]';
```

[`JSON_SET()`](json-modification-functions.md#function_json-set) replaces values for
paths that exist and adds values for paths that do not exist:.

```sql
mysql> SELECT JSON_SET(@j, '$[1].b[0]', 1, '$[2][2]', 2);
+--------------------------------------------+
| JSON_SET(@j, '$[1].b[0]', 1, '$[2][2]', 2) |
+--------------------------------------------+
| ["a", {"b": [1, false]}, [10, 20, 2]]      |
+--------------------------------------------+
```

In this case, the path `$[1].b[0]` selects an
existing value (`true`), which is replaced with
the value following the path argument (`1`).
The path `$[2][2]` does not exist, so the
corresponding value (`2`) is added to the value
selected by `$[2]`.

[`JSON_INSERT()`](json-modification-functions.md#function_json-insert) adds new values but
does not replace existing values:

```sql
mysql> SELECT JSON_INSERT(@j, '$[1].b[0]', 1, '$[2][2]', 2);
+-----------------------------------------------+
| JSON_INSERT(@j, '$[1].b[0]', 1, '$[2][2]', 2) |
+-----------------------------------------------+
| ["a", {"b": [true, false]}, [10, 20, 2]]      |
+-----------------------------------------------+
```

[`JSON_REPLACE()`](json-modification-functions.md#function_json-replace) replaces existing
values and ignores new values:

```sql
mysql> SELECT JSON_REPLACE(@j, '$[1].b[0]', 1, '$[2][2]', 2);
+------------------------------------------------+
| JSON_REPLACE(@j, '$[1].b[0]', 1, '$[2][2]', 2) |
+------------------------------------------------+
| ["a", {"b": [1, false]}, [10, 20]]             |
+------------------------------------------------+
```

The path-value pairs are evaluated left to right. The document
produced by evaluating one pair becomes the new value against
which the next pair is evaluated.

`JSON_REMOVE()` takes a JSON document and one
or more paths that specify values to be removed from the
document. The return value is the original document minus the
values selected by paths that exist within the document:

```sql
mysql> SELECT JSON_REMOVE(@j, '$[2]', '$[1].b[1]', '$[1].b[1]');
+---------------------------------------------------+
| JSON_REMOVE(@j, '$[2]', '$[1].b[1]', '$[1].b[1]') |
+---------------------------------------------------+
| ["a", {"b": [true]}]                              |
+---------------------------------------------------+
```

The paths have these effects:

- `$[2]` matches `[10, 20]`
  and removes it.
- The first instance of `$[1].b[1]` matches
  `false` in the `b` element
  and removes it.
- The second instance of `$[1].b[1]` matches
  nothing: That element has already been removed, the path no
  longer exists, and has no effect.

### JSON Path Syntax

Many of the JSON functions supported by MySQL and described
elsewhere in this Manual (see [Section 14.17, “JSON Functions”](json-functions.md "14.17 JSON Functions"))
require a path expression in order to identify a specific
element in a JSON document. A path consists of the path's
scope followed by one or more path legs. For paths used in MySQL
JSON functions, the scope is always the document being searched
or otherwise operated on, represented by a leading
`$` character. Path legs are separated by
period characters (`.`). Cells in arrays are
represented by
`[N]`, where
*`N`* is a non-negative integer. Names of
keys must be double-quoted strings or valid ECMAScript
identifiers (see
[*Identifier
Names and Identifiers*](http://www.ecma-international.org/ecma-262/5.1/#sec-7.6), in the
*ECMAScript Language Specification*). Path
expressions, like JSON text, should be encoded using the
`ascii`, `utf8mb3`, or
`utf8mb4` character set. Other character
encodings are implicitly coerced to `utf8mb4`.
The complete syntax is shown here:

```clike
pathExpression:
    scope[(pathLeg)*]

pathLeg:
    member | arrayLocation | doubleAsterisk

member:
    period ( keyName | asterisk )

arrayLocation:
    leftBracket ( nonNegativeInteger | asterisk ) rightBracket

keyName:
    ESIdentifier | doubleQuotedString

doubleAsterisk:
    '**'

period:
    '.'

asterisk:
    '*'

leftBracket:
    '['

rightBracket:
    ']'
```

As noted previously, in MySQL, the scope of the path is always
the document being operated on, represented as
`$`. You can use `'$'` as a
synonym for the document in JSON path expressions.

Note

Some implementations support column references for scopes of
JSON paths; MySQL 8.0 does not support these.

The wildcard `*` and `**`
tokens are used as follows:

- `.*` represents the values of all members
  in the object.
- `[*]` represents the values of all cells in
  the array.
- `[prefix]**suffix`
  represents all paths beginning with
  *`prefix`* and ending with
  *`suffix`*.
  *`prefix`* is optional, while
  *`suffix`* is required; in other
  words, a path may not end in `**`.

  In addition, a path may not contain the sequence
  `***`.

For path syntax examples, see the descriptions of the various
JSON functions that take paths as arguments, such as
[`JSON_CONTAINS_PATH()`](json-search-functions.md#function_json-contains-path),
[`JSON_SET()`](json-modification-functions.md#function_json-set), and
[`JSON_REPLACE()`](json-modification-functions.md#function_json-replace). For examples
which include the use of the `*` and
`**` wildcards, see the description of the
[`JSON_SEARCH()`](json-search-functions.md#function_json-search) function.

MySQL 8.0 also supports range notation for subsets of JSON
arrays using the `to` keyword (such as
`$[2 to 10]`), as well as the
`last` keyword as a synonym for the rightmost
element of an array. See [Searching and Modifying JSON Values](json.md#json-paths "Searching and Modifying JSON Values"), for more
information and examples.

### Comparison and Ordering of JSON Values

JSON values can be compared using the
[`=`](comparison-operators.md#operator_equal),
[`<`](comparison-operators.md#operator_less-than),
[`<=`](comparison-operators.md#operator_less-than-or-equal),
[`>`](comparison-operators.md#operator_greater-than),
[`>=`](comparison-operators.md#operator_greater-than-or-equal),
[`<>`](comparison-operators.md#operator_not-equal),
[`!=`](comparison-operators.md#operator_not-equal), and
[`<=>`](comparison-operators.md#operator_equal-to)
operators.

The following comparison operators and functions are not yet
supported with JSON values:

- [`BETWEEN`](comparison-operators.md#operator_between)
- [`IN()`](comparison-operators.md#operator_in)
- [`GREATEST()`](comparison-operators.md#function_greatest)
- [`LEAST()`](comparison-operators.md#function_least)

A workaround for the comparison operators and functions just
listed is to cast JSON values to a native MySQL numeric or
string data type so they have a consistent non-JSON scalar type.

Comparison of JSON values takes place at two levels. The first
level of comparison is based on the JSON types of the compared
values. If the types differ, the comparison result is determined
solely by which type has higher precedence. If the two values
have the same JSON type, a second level of comparison occurs
using type-specific rules.

The following list shows the precedences of JSON types, from
highest precedence to the lowest. (The type names are those
returned by the [`JSON_TYPE()`](json-attribute-functions.md#function_json-type)
function.) Types shown together on a line have the same
precedence. Any value having a JSON type listed earlier in the
list compares greater than any value having a JSON type listed
later in the list.

```simple
BLOB
BIT
OPAQUE
DATETIME
TIME
DATE
BOOLEAN
ARRAY
OBJECT
STRING
INTEGER, DOUBLE
NULL
```

For JSON values of the same precedence, the comparison rules are
type specific:

- `BLOB`

  The first *`N`* bytes of the two
  values are compared, where *`N`* is
  the number of bytes in the shorter value. If the first
  *`N`* bytes of the two values are
  identical, the shorter value is ordered before the longer
  value.
- `BIT`

  Same rules as for `BLOB`.
- `OPAQUE`

  Same rules as for `BLOB`.
  `OPAQUE` values are values that are not
  classified as one of the other types.
- `DATETIME`

  A value that represents an earlier point in time is ordered
  before a value that represents a later point in time. If two
  values originally come from the MySQL
  `DATETIME` and `TIMESTAMP`
  types, respectively, they are equal if they represent the
  same point in time.
- `TIME`

  The smaller of two time values is ordered before the larger
  one.
- `DATE`

  The earlier date is ordered before the more recent date.
- `ARRAY`

  Two JSON arrays are equal if they have the same length and
  values in corresponding positions in the arrays are equal.

  If the arrays are not equal, their order is determined by
  the elements in the first position where there is a
  difference. The array with the smaller value in that
  position is ordered first. If all values of the shorter
  array are equal to the corresponding values in the longer
  array, the shorter array is ordered first.

  Example:

  ```simple
  [] < ["a"] < ["ab"] < ["ab", "cd", "ef"] < ["ab", "ef"]
  ```
- `BOOLEAN`

  The JSON false literal is less than the JSON true literal.
- `OBJECT`

  Two JSON objects are equal if they have the same set of
  keys, and each key has the same value in both objects.

  Example:

  ```simple
  {"a": 1, "b": 2} = {"b": 2, "a": 1}
  ```

  The order of two objects that are not equal is unspecified
  but deterministic.
- `STRING`

  Strings are ordered lexically on the first
  *`N`* bytes of the
  `utf8mb4` representation of the two strings
  being compared, where *`N`* is the
  length of the shorter string. If the first
  *`N`* bytes of the two strings are
  identical, the shorter string is considered smaller than the
  longer string.

  Example:

  ```simple
  "a" < "ab" < "b" < "bc"
  ```

  This ordering is equivalent to the ordering of SQL strings
  with collation `utf8mb4_bin`. Because
  `utf8mb4_bin` is a binary collation,
  comparison of JSON values is case-sensitive:

  ```simple
  "A" < "a"
  ```
- `INTEGER`, `DOUBLE`

  JSON values can contain exact-value numbers and
  approximate-value numbers. For a general discussion of these
  types of numbers, see [Section 11.1.2, “Numeric Literals”](number-literals.md "11.1.2 Numeric Literals").

  The rules for comparing native MySQL numeric types are
  discussed in [Section 14.3, “Type Conversion in Expression Evaluation”](type-conversion.md "14.3 Type Conversion in Expression Evaluation"), but the
  rules for comparing numbers within JSON values differ
  somewhat:

  - In a comparison between two columns that use the native
    MySQL [`INT`](integer-types.md "13.1.2 Integer Types (Exact Value) - INTEGER, INT, SMALLINT, TINYINT, MEDIUMINT, BIGINT") and
    [`DOUBLE`](floating-point-types.md "13.1.4 Floating-Point Types (Approximate Value) - FLOAT, DOUBLE") numeric types,
    respectively, it is known that all comparisons involve
    an integer and a double, so the integer is converted to
    double for all rows. That is, exact-value numbers are
    converted to approximate-value numbers.
  - On the other hand, if the query compares two JSON
    columns containing numbers, it cannot be known in
    advance whether numbers are integer or double. To
    provide the most consistent behavior across all rows,
    MySQL converts approximate-value numbers to exact-value
    numbers. The resulting ordering is consistent and does
    not lose precision for the exact-value numbers. For
    example, given the scalars 9223372036854775805,
    9223372036854775806, 9223372036854775807 and
    9.223372036854776e18, the order is such as this:

    ```sql
    9223372036854775805 < 9223372036854775806 < 9223372036854775807
    < 9.223372036854776e18 = 9223372036854776000 < 9223372036854776001
    ```

  Were JSON comparisons to use the non-JSON numeric comparison
  rules, inconsistent ordering could occur. The usual MySQL
  comparison rules for numbers yield these orderings:

  - Integer comparison:

    ```sql
    9223372036854775805 < 9223372036854775806 < 9223372036854775807
    ```

    (not defined for 9.223372036854776e18)
  - Double comparison:

    ```simple
    9223372036854775805 = 9223372036854775806 = 9223372036854775807 = 9.223372036854776e18
    ```

For comparison of any JSON value to SQL `NULL`,
the result is `UNKNOWN`.

For comparison of JSON and non-JSON values, the non-JSON value
is converted to JSON according to the rules in the following
table, then the values compared as described previously.

### Converting between JSON and non-JSON values

The following table provides a summary of the rules that MySQL
follows when casting between JSON values and values of other
types:

**Table 13.3 JSON Conversion Rules**

| other type | CAST(other type AS JSON) | CAST(JSON AS other type) |
| --- | --- | --- |
| JSON | No change | No change |
| utf8 character type (`utf8mb4`, `utf8mb3`, `ascii`) | The string is parsed into a JSON value. | The JSON value is serialized into a `utf8mb4` string. |
| Other character types | Other character encodings are implicitly converted to `utf8mb4` and treated as described for this character type. | The JSON value is serialized into a `utf8mb4` string, then cast to the other character encoding. The result may not be meaningful. |
| `NULL` | Results in a `NULL` value of type JSON. | Not applicable. |
| Geometry types | The geometry value is converted into a JSON document by calling [`ST_AsGeoJSON()`](spatial-geojson-functions.md#function_st-asgeojson). | Illegal operation. Workaround: Pass the result of [`CAST(json_val AS CHAR)`](cast-functions.md#function_cast) to [`ST_GeomFromGeoJSON()`](spatial-geojson-functions.md#function_st-geomfromgeojson). |
| All other types | Results in a JSON document consisting of a single scalar value. | Succeeds if the JSON document consists of a single scalar value of the target type and that scalar value can be cast to the target type. Otherwise, returns `NULL` and produces a warning. |

`ORDER BY` and `GROUP BY` for
JSON values works according to these principles:

- Ordering of scalar JSON values uses the same rules as in the
  preceding discussion.
- For ascending sorts, SQL `NULL` orders
  before all JSON values, including the JSON null literal; for
  descending sorts, SQL `NULL` orders after
  all JSON values, including the JSON null literal.
- Sort keys for JSON values are bound by the value of the
  [`max_sort_length`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_max_sort_length) system
  variable, so keys that differ only after the first
  [`max_sort_length`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_max_sort_length) bytes
  compare as equal.
- Sorting of nonscalar values is not currently supported and a
  warning occurs.

For sorting, it can be beneficial to cast a JSON scalar to some
other native MySQL type. For example, if a column named
`jdoc` contains JSON objects having a member
consisting of an `id` key and a nonnegative
value, use this expression to sort by `id`
values:

```sql
ORDER BY CAST(JSON_EXTRACT(jdoc, '$.id') AS UNSIGNED)
```

If there happens to be a generated column defined to use the
same expression as in the `ORDER BY`, the MySQL
optimizer recognizes that and considers using the index for the
query execution plan. See
[Section 10.3.11, “Optimizer Use of Generated Column Indexes”](generated-column-index-optimizations.md "10.3.11 Optimizer Use of Generated Column Indexes").

### Aggregation of JSON Values

For aggregation of JSON values, SQL `NULL`
values are ignored as for other data types.
Non-`NULL` values are converted to a numeric
type and aggregated, except for
[`MIN()`](aggregate-functions.md#function_min),
[`MAX()`](aggregate-functions.md#function_max), and
[`GROUP_CONCAT()`](aggregate-functions.md#function_group-concat). The conversion to
number should produce a meaningful result for JSON values that
are numeric scalars, although (depending on the values)
truncation and loss of precision may occur. Conversion to number
of other JSON values may not produce a meaningful result.
