#### 19.1.6.4 Binary Logging Options and Variables

- [Startup Options Used with Binary Logging](replication-options-binary-log.md#replication-optvars-binlog "Startup Options Used with Binary Logging")
- [System Variables Used with Binary Logging](replication-options-binary-log.md#replication-sysvars-binlog "System Variables Used with Binary Logging")

You can use the [**mysqld**](mysqld.md "6.3.1 mysqld — The MySQL Server") options and system
variables that are described in this section to affect the
operation of the binary log as well as to control which statements
are written to the binary log. For additional information about
the binary log, see [Section 7.4.4, “The Binary Log”](binary-log.md "7.4.4 The Binary Log"). For additional
information about using MySQL server options and system variables,
see [Section 7.1.7, “Server Command Options”](server-options.md "7.1.7 Server Command Options"), and
[Section 7.1.8, “Server System Variables”](server-system-variables.md "7.1.8 Server System Variables").

##### Startup Options Used with Binary Logging

The following list describes startup options for enabling and
configuring the binary log. System variables used with binary
logging are discussed later in this section.

- [`--binlog-row-event-max-size=N`](replication-options-binary-log.md#option_mysqld_binlog-row-event-max-size)

  |  |  |
  | --- | --- |
  | Command-Line Format | `--binlog-row-event-max-size=#` |
  | System Variable (≥ 8.0.14) | `binlog_row_event_max_size` |
  | Scope (≥ 8.0.14) | Global |
  | Dynamic (≥ 8.0.14) | No |
  | [`SET_VAR`](optimizer-hints.md#optimizer-hints-set-var "Variable-Setting Hint Syntax") Hint Applies (≥ 8.0.14) | No |
  | Type | Integer |
  | Default Value | `8192` |
  | Minimum Value | `256` |
  | Maximum Value (64-bit platforms) | `18446744073709551615` |
  | Maximum Value (32-bit platforms) | `4294967295` |
  | Unit | bytes |

  When row-based binary logging is used, this setting is a
  soft limit on the maximum size of a row-based binary log
  event, in bytes. Where possible, rows stored in the binary
  log are grouped into events with a size not exceeding the
  value of this setting. If an event cannot be split, the
  maximum size can be exceeded. The value must be (or else
  gets rounded down to) a multiple of 256. The default is 8192
  bytes.
- [`--log-bin[=base_name]`](replication-options-binary-log.md#option_mysqld_log-bin)

  |  |  |
  | --- | --- |
  | Command-Line Format | `--log-bin=file_name` |
  | Type | File name |

  Specifies the base name to use for binary log files. With
  binary logging enabled, the server logs all statements that
  change data to the binary log, which is used for backup and
  replication. The binary log is a sequence of files with a
  base name and numeric extension. The
  `--log-bin` option value is the base name for
  the log sequence. The server creates binary log files in
  sequence by adding a numeric suffix to the base name.

  If you do not supply the `--log-bin` option,
  MySQL uses `binlog` as the default base
  name for the binary log files. For compatibility with
  earlier releases, if you supply the
  `--log-bin` option with no string or with an
  empty string, the base name defaults to
  `host_name-bin`,
  using the name of the host machine.

  The default location for binary log files is the data
  directory. You can use the `--log-bin` option
  to specify an alternative location, by adding a leading
  absolute path name to the base name to specify a different
  directory. When the server reads an entry from the binary
  log index file, which tracks the binary log files that have
  been used, it checks whether the entry contains a relative
  path. If it does, the relative part of the path is replaced
  with the absolute path set using the
  `--log-bin` option. An absolute path recorded
  in the binary log index file remains unchanged; in such a
  case, the index file must be edited manually to enable a new
  path or paths to be used. The binary log file base name and
  any specified path are available as the
  [`log_bin_basename`](replication-options-binary-log.md#sysvar_log_bin_basename) system
  variable.

  In earlier MySQL versions, binary logging was disabled by
  default, and was enabled if you specified the
  `--log-bin` option. From MySQL 8.0, binary
  logging is enabled by default, whether or not you specify
  the `--log-bin` option. The exception is if
  you use [**mysqld**](mysqld.md "6.3.1 mysqld — The MySQL Server") to initialize the data
  directory manually by invoking it with the
  `--initialize` or
  `--initialize-insecure` option, when binary
  logging is disabled by default. It is possible to enable
  binary logging in this case by specifying the
  `--log-bin` option. When binary logging is
  enabled, the [`log_bin`](replication-options-binary-log.md#sysvar_log_bin) system
  variable, which shows the status of binary logging on the
  server, is set to ON.

  To disable binary logging, you can specify the
  [`--skip-log-bin`](replication-options-binary-log.md#option_mysqld_log-bin)
  or
  [`--disable-log-bin`](replication-options-binary-log.md#option_mysqld_log-bin)
  option at startup. If either of these options is specified
  and `--log-bin` is also specified, the option
  specified later takes precedence. When binary logging is
  disabled, the [`log_bin`](replication-options-binary-log.md#sysvar_log_bin)
  system variable is set to OFF.

  When GTIDs are in use on the server, if you disable binary
  logging when restarting the server after an abnormal
  shutdown, some GTIDs are likely to be lost, causing
  replication to fail. In a normal shutdown, the set of GTIDs
  from the current binary log file is saved in the
  `mysql.gtid_executed` table. Following an
  abnormal shutdown where this did not happen, during recovery
  the GTIDs are added to the table from the binary log file,
  provided that binary logging is still enabled. If binary
  logging is disabled for the server restart, the server
  cannot access the binary log file to recover the GTIDs, so
  replication cannot be started. Binary logging can be
  disabled safely after a normal shutdown.

  The [`--log-slave-updates`](replication-options-binary-log.md#sysvar_log_slave_updates) and
  [`--slave-preserve-commit-order`](replication-options-replica.md#sysvar_slave_preserve_commit_order)
  options require binary logging. If you disable binary
  logging, either omit these options, or specify
  [`--log-slave-updates=OFF`](replication-options-binary-log.md#sysvar_log_slave_updates) and
  [`--skip-slave-preserve-commit-order`](replication-options-replica.md#sysvar_slave_preserve_commit_order).
  MySQL disables these options by default when
  [`--skip-log-bin`](replication-options-binary-log.md#option_mysqld_log-bin)
  or
  [`--disable-log-bin`](replication-options-binary-log.md#option_mysqld_log-bin)
  is specified. If you specify
  [`--log-slave-updates`](replication-options-binary-log.md#sysvar_log_slave_updates) or
  [`--slave-preserve-commit-order`](replication-options-replica.md#sysvar_slave_preserve_commit_order)
  together with
  [`--skip-log-bin`](replication-options-binary-log.md#option_mysqld_log-bin)
  or
  [`--disable-log-bin`](replication-options-binary-log.md#option_mysqld_log-bin),
  a warning or error message is issued.

  In MySQL 5.7, a server ID had to be specified when binary
  logging was enabled, or the server would not start. In MySQL
  8.0, the
  [`server_id`](replication-options.md#sysvar_server_id) system variable
  is set to 1 by default. The server can now be started with
  this default server ID when binary logging is enabled, but
  an informational message is issued if you do not specify a
  server ID explicitly by setting the
  [`server_id`](replication-options.md#sysvar_server_id) system variable.
  For servers that are used in a replication topology, you
  must specify a unique nonzero server ID for each server.

  For information on the format and management of the binary
  log, see [Section 7.4.4, “The Binary Log”](binary-log.md "7.4.4 The Binary Log").
- [`--log-bin-index[=file_name]`](replication-options-binary-log.md#option_mysqld_log-bin-index)

  |  |  |
  | --- | --- |
  | Command-Line Format | `--log-bin-index=file_name` |
  | System Variable | `log_bin_index` |
  | Scope | Global |
  | Dynamic | No |
  | [`SET_VAR`](optimizer-hints.md#optimizer-hints-set-var "Variable-Setting Hint Syntax") Hint Applies | No |
  | Type | File name |

  The name for the binary log index file, which contains the
  names of the binary log files. By default, it has the same
  location and base name as the value specified for the binary
  log files using the [`--log-bin`](replication-options-binary-log.md#option_mysqld_log-bin)
  option, plus the extension `.index`. If
  you do not specify [`--log-bin`](replication-options-binary-log.md#option_mysqld_log-bin),
  the default binary log index file name is
  `binlog.index`. If you specify
  [`--log-bin`](replication-options-binary-log.md#option_mysqld_log-bin) option with no
  string or an empty string, the default binary log index file
  name is
  `host_name-bin.index`,
  using the name of the host machine.

  For information on the format and management of the binary
  log, see [Section 7.4.4, “The Binary Log”](binary-log.md "7.4.4 The Binary Log").

**Statement selection options.**
The options in the following list affect which statements are
written to the binary log, and thus sent by a replication
source server to its replicas. There are also options for
replicas that control which statements received from the
source should be executed or ignored. For details, see
[Section 19.1.6.3, “Replica Server Options and Variables”](replication-options-replica.md "19.1.6.3 Replica Server Options and Variables").

- [`--binlog-do-db=db_name`](replication-options-binary-log.md#option_mysqld_binlog-do-db)

  |  |  |
  | --- | --- |
  | Command-Line Format | `--binlog-do-db=name` |
  | Type | String |

  This option affects binary logging in a manner similar to
  the way that
  [`--replicate-do-db`](replication-options-replica.md#option_mysqld_replicate-do-db) affects
  replication.

  The effects of this option depend on whether the
  statement-based or row-based logging format is in use, in
  the same way that the effects of
  [`--replicate-do-db`](replication-options-replica.md#option_mysqld_replicate-do-db) depend on
  whether statement-based or row-based replication is in use.
  You should keep in mind that the format used to log a given
  statement may not necessarily be the same as that indicated
  by the value of
  [`binlog_format`](replication-options-binary-log.md#sysvar_binlog_format). For example,
  DDL statements such as [`CREATE
  TABLE`](create-table.md "15.1.20 CREATE TABLE Statement") and [`ALTER
  TABLE`](alter-table.md "15.1.9 ALTER TABLE Statement") are always logged as statements, without
  regard to the logging format in effect, so the following
  statement-based rules for `--binlog-do-db`
  always apply in determining whether or not the statement is
  logged.

  **Statement-based logging.**
  Only those statements are written to the binary log where
  the default database (that is, the one selected by
  [`USE`](use.md "15.8.4 USE Statement")) is
  *`db_name`*. To specify more than
  one database, use this option multiple times, once for
  each database; however, doing so does
  *not* cause cross-database statements
  such as `UPDATE
  some_db.some_table SET
  foo='bar'` to be logged while a different
  database (or no database) is selected.

  Warning

  To specify multiple databases you
  *must* use multiple instances of this
  option. Because database names can contain commas, the
  list is treated as the name of a single database if you
  supply a comma-separated list.

  An example of what does not work as you might expect when
  using statement-based logging: If the server is started with
  [`--binlog-do-db=sales`](replication-options-binary-log.md#option_mysqld_binlog-do-db) and you
  issue the following statements, the
  [`UPDATE`](update.md "15.2.17 UPDATE Statement") statement is
  *not* logged:

  ```sql
  USE prices;
  UPDATE sales.january SET amount=amount+1000;
  ```

  The main reason for this “just check the default
  database” behavior is that it is difficult from the
  statement alone to know whether it should be replicated (for
  example, if you are using multiple-table
  [`DELETE`](delete.md "15.2.2 DELETE Statement") statements or
  multiple-table [`UPDATE`](update.md "15.2.17 UPDATE Statement")
  statements that act across multiple databases). It is also
  faster to check only the default database rather than all
  databases if there is no need.

  Another case which may not be self-evident occurs when a
  given database is replicated even though it was not
  specified when setting the option. If the server is started
  with `--binlog-do-db=sales`, the following
  [`UPDATE`](update.md "15.2.17 UPDATE Statement") statement is logged
  even though `prices` was not included when
  setting `--binlog-do-db`:

  ```sql
  USE sales;
  UPDATE prices.discounts SET percentage = percentage + 10;
  ```

  Because `sales` is the default database
  when the [`UPDATE`](update.md "15.2.17 UPDATE Statement") statement is
  issued, the [`UPDATE`](update.md "15.2.17 UPDATE Statement") is logged.

  **Row-based logging.**
  Logging is restricted to database
  *`db_name`*. Only changes to tables
  belonging to *`db_name`* are
  logged; the default database has no effect on this.
  Suppose that the server is started with
  [`--binlog-do-db=sales`](replication-options-binary-log.md#option_mysqld_binlog-do-db) and
  row-based logging is in effect, and then the following
  statements are executed:

  ```sql
  USE prices;
  UPDATE sales.february SET amount=amount+100;
  ```

  The changes to the `february` table in the
  `sales` database are logged in accordance
  with the [`UPDATE`](update.md "15.2.17 UPDATE Statement") statement;
  this occurs whether or not the
  [`USE`](use.md "15.8.4 USE Statement") statement was issued.
  However, when using the row-based logging format and
  [`--binlog-do-db=sales`](replication-options-binary-log.md#option_mysqld_binlog-do-db), changes
  made by the following [`UPDATE`](update.md "15.2.17 UPDATE Statement")
  are not logged:

  ```sql
  USE prices;
  UPDATE prices.march SET amount=amount-25;
  ```

  Even if the `USE prices` statement were
  changed to `USE sales`, the
  [`UPDATE`](update.md "15.2.17 UPDATE Statement") statement's
  effects would still not be written to the binary log.

  Another important difference in
  [`--binlog-do-db`](replication-options-binary-log.md#option_mysqld_binlog-do-db) handling for
  statement-based logging as opposed to the row-based logging
  occurs with regard to statements that refer to multiple
  databases. Suppose that the server is started with
  [`--binlog-do-db=db1`](replication-options-binary-log.md#option_mysqld_binlog-do-db), and the
  following statements are executed:

  ```sql
  USE db1;
  UPDATE db1.table1, db2.table2 SET db1.table1.col1 = 10, db2.table2.col2 = 20;
  ```

  If you are using statement-based logging, the updates to
  both tables are written to the binary log. However, when
  using the row-based format, only the changes to
  `table1` are logged;
  `table2` is in a different database, so it
  is not changed by the [`UPDATE`](update.md "15.2.17 UPDATE Statement").
  Now suppose that, instead of the `USE db1`
  statement, a `USE db4` statement had been
  used:

  ```sql
  USE db4;
  UPDATE db1.table1, db2.table2 SET db1.table1.col1 = 10, db2.table2.col2 = 20;
  ```

  In this case, the [`UPDATE`](update.md "15.2.17 UPDATE Statement")
  statement is not written to the binary log when using
  statement-based logging. However, when using row-based
  logging, the change to `table1` is logged,
  but not that to `table2`—in other
  words, only changes to tables in the database named by
  [`--binlog-do-db`](replication-options-binary-log.md#option_mysqld_binlog-do-db) are logged,
  and the choice of default database has no effect on this
  behavior.
- [`--binlog-ignore-db=db_name`](replication-options-binary-log.md#option_mysqld_binlog-ignore-db)

  |  |  |
  | --- | --- |
  | Command-Line Format | `--binlog-ignore-db=name` |
  | Type | String |

  This option affects binary logging in a manner similar to
  the way that
  [`--replicate-ignore-db`](replication-options-replica.md#option_mysqld_replicate-ignore-db) affects
  replication.

  The effects of this option depend on whether the
  statement-based or row-based logging format is in use, in
  the same way that the effects of
  [`--replicate-ignore-db`](replication-options-replica.md#option_mysqld_replicate-ignore-db) depend
  on whether statement-based or row-based replication is in
  use. You should keep in mind that the format used to log a
  given statement may not necessarily be the same as that
  indicated by the value of
  [`binlog_format`](replication-options-binary-log.md#sysvar_binlog_format). For example,
  DDL statements such as [`CREATE
  TABLE`](create-table.md "15.1.20 CREATE TABLE Statement") and [`ALTER
  TABLE`](alter-table.md "15.1.9 ALTER TABLE Statement") are always logged as statements, without
  regard to the logging format in effect, so the following
  statement-based rules for
  `--binlog-ignore-db` always apply in
  determining whether or not the statement is logged.

  **Statement-based logging.**
  Tells the server to not log any statement where the
  default database (that is, the one selected by
  [`USE`](use.md "15.8.4 USE Statement")) is
  *`db_name`*.

  When there is no default database, no
  `--binlog-ignore-db` options are applied, and
  such statements are always logged. (Bug #11829838, Bug
  #60188)

  **Row-based format.**
  Tells the server not to log updates to any tables in the
  database *`db_name`*. The current
  database has no effect.

  When using statement-based logging, the following example
  does not work as you might expect. Suppose that the server
  is started with
  [`--binlog-ignore-db=sales`](replication-options-binary-log.md#option_mysqld_binlog-ignore-db) and
  you issue the following statements:

  ```sql
  USE prices;
  UPDATE sales.january SET amount=amount+1000;
  ```

  The [`UPDATE`](update.md "15.2.17 UPDATE Statement") statement
  *is* logged in such a case because
  [`--binlog-ignore-db`](replication-options-binary-log.md#option_mysqld_binlog-ignore-db) applies
  only to the default database (determined by the
  [`USE`](use.md "15.8.4 USE Statement") statement). Because the
  `sales` database was specified explicitly
  in the statement, the statement has not been filtered.
  However, when using row-based logging, the
  [`UPDATE`](update.md "15.2.17 UPDATE Statement") statement's
  effects are *not* written to the binary
  log, which means that no changes to the
  `sales.january` table are logged; in this
  instance,
  [`--binlog-ignore-db=sales`](replication-options-binary-log.md#option_mysqld_binlog-ignore-db)
  causes *all* changes made to tables in
  the source's copy of the `sales`
  database to be ignored for purposes of binary logging.

  To specify more than one database to ignore, use this option
  multiple times, once for each database. Because database
  names can contain commas, the list is treated as the name of
  a single database if you supply a comma-separated list.

  You should not use this option if you are using
  cross-database updates and you do not want these updates to
  be logged.

**Checksum options.**
MySQL supports reading and writing of binary log checksums.
These are enabled using the two options listed here:

- [`--binlog-checksum={NONE|CRC32}`](replication-options-binary-log.md#option_mysqld_binlog-checksum)

  |  |  |
  | --- | --- |
  | Command-Line Format | `--binlog-checksum=type` |
  | Type | String |
  | Default Value | `CRC32` |
  | Valid Values | `NONE`  `CRC32` |

  Enabling this option causes the source to write checksums
  for events written to the binary log. Set to
  `NONE` to disable, or the name of the
  algorithm to be used for generating checksums; currently,
  only CRC32 checksums are supported, and CRC32 is the
  default. You cannot change the setting for this option
  within a transaction.

To control reading of checksums by the replica (from the relay
log), use the
[`--slave-sql-verify-checksum`](replication-options-replica.md#option_mysqld_slave-sql-verify-checksum)
option.

**Testing and debugging options.**
The following binary log options are used in replication
testing and debugging. They are not intended for use in normal
operations.

- [`--max-binlog-dump-events=N`](replication-options-binary-log.md#option_mysqld_max-binlog-dump-events)

  |  |  |
  | --- | --- |
  | Command-Line Format | `--max-binlog-dump-events=#` |
  | Type | Integer |
  | Default Value | `0` |

  This option is used internally by the MySQL test suite for
  replication testing and debugging.
- [`--sporadic-binlog-dump-fail`](replication-options-binary-log.md#option_mysqld_sporadic-binlog-dump-fail)

  |  |  |
  | --- | --- |
  | Command-Line Format | `--sporadic-binlog-dump-fail[={OFF|ON}]` |
  | Type | Boolean |
  | Default Value | `OFF` |

  This option is used internally by the MySQL test suite for
  replication testing and debugging.

##### System Variables Used with Binary Logging

The following list describes system variables for controlling
binary logging. They can be set at server startup and some of
them can be changed at runtime using
[`SET`](set-variable.md "15.7.6.1 SET Syntax for Variable Assignment").
Server options used to control binary logging are listed earlier
in this section.

- [`binlog_cache_size`](replication-options-binary-log.md#sysvar_binlog_cache_size)

  |  |  |
  | --- | --- |
  | Command-Line Format | `--binlog-cache-size=#` |
  | System Variable | `binlog_cache_size` |
  | Scope | Global |
  | Dynamic | Yes |
  | [`SET_VAR`](optimizer-hints.md#optimizer-hints-set-var "Variable-Setting Hint Syntax") Hint Applies | No |
  | Type | Integer |
  | Default Value | `32768` |
  | Minimum Value | `4096` |
  | Maximum Value (64-bit platforms) | `18446744073709547520` |
  | Maximum Value (32-bit platforms) | `4294963200` |
  | Unit | bytes |
  | [Block Size](server-system-variables.md#system-variables-block-size "Note") | `4096` |

  The size of the memory buffer to hold changes to the binary
  log during a transaction.

  When binary logging is enabled on the server (with the
  [`log_bin`](replication-options-binary-log.md#sysvar_log_bin) system variable set
  to ON), a binary log cache is allocated for each client if
  the server supports any transactional storage engines. If
  the data for the transaction exceeds the space in the memory
  buffer, the excess data is stored in a temporary file. When
  binary log encryption is active on the server, the memory
  buffer is not encrypted, but (from MySQL 8.0.17) any
  temporary file used to hold the binary log cache is
  encrypted. After each transaction is committed, the binary
  log cache is reset by clearing the memory buffer and
  truncating the temporary file if used.

  If you often use large transactions, you can increase this
  cache size to get better performance by reducing or
  eliminating the need to write to temporary files. The
  [`Binlog_cache_use`](server-status-variables.md#statvar_Binlog_cache_use) and
  [`Binlog_cache_disk_use`](server-status-variables.md#statvar_Binlog_cache_disk_use)
  status variables can be useful for tuning the size of this
  variable. See [Section 7.4.4, “The Binary Log”](binary-log.md "7.4.4 The Binary Log").

  `binlog_cache_size` sets the size for the
  transaction cache only; the size of the statement cache is
  governed by the
  [`binlog_stmt_cache_size`](replication-options-binary-log.md#sysvar_binlog_stmt_cache_size)
  system variable.
- [`binlog_checksum`](replication-options-binary-log.md#sysvar_binlog_checksum)

  |  |  |
  | --- | --- |
  | Command-Line Format | `--binlog-checksum=type` |
  | System Variable | `binlog_checksum` |
  | Scope | Global |
  | Dynamic | Yes |
  | [`SET_VAR`](optimizer-hints.md#optimizer-hints-set-var "Variable-Setting Hint Syntax") Hint Applies | No |
  | Type | String |
  | Default Value | `CRC32` |
  | Valid Values | `NONE`  `CRC32` |

  When enabled, this variable causes the source to write a
  checksum for each event in the binary log.
  `binlog_checksum` supports the values
  `NONE` (which disables checksums) and
  `CRC32`. The default is
  `CRC32`. When
  `binlog_checksum` is disabled (value
  `NONE`), the server verifies that it is
  writing only complete events to the binary log by writing
  and checking the event length (rather than a checksum) for
  each event.

  Setting this variable on the source to a value unrecognized
  by the replica causes the replica to set its own
  `binlog_checksum` value to
  `NONE`, and to stop replication with an
  error. If backward compatibility with older replicas is a
  concern, you may want to set the value explicitly to
  `NONE`.

  Up to and including MySQL 8.0.20, Group Replication cannot
  make use of checksums and does not support their presence in
  the binary log, so you must set
  [`binlog_checksum=NONE`](replication-options-binary-log.md#sysvar_binlog_checksum) when
  configuring a server instance to become a group member. From
  MySQL 8.0.21, Group Replication supports checksums, so group
  members may use the default setting.

  Changing the value of `binlog_checksum`
  causes the binary log to be rotated, because checksums must
  be written for an entire binary log file, and never for only
  part of one. You cannot change the value of
  `binlog_checksum` within a transaction.

  When binary log transaction compression is enabled using the
  [`binlog_transaction_compression`](replication-options-binary-log.md#sysvar_binlog_transaction_compression)
  system variable, checksums are not written for individual
  events in a compressed transaction payload. Instead a
  checksum is written for the GTID event, and a checksum for
  the compressed `Transaction_payload_event`.

  Due to concurrency issues, a replica can become inconsistent
  when a transaction contains updates to both transactional
  and nontransactional tables. MySQL tries to preserve
  causality among these statements by writing nontransactional
  statements to the transaction cache, which is flushed upon
  commit. However, problems arise when modifications done to
  nontransactional tables on behalf of a transaction become
  immediately visible to other connections because these
  changes may not be written immediately into the binary log.

  The
  [`binlog_direct_non_transactional_updates`](replication-options-binary-log.md#sysvar_binlog_direct_non_transactional_updates)
  variable offers one possible workaround to this issue. By
  default, this variable is disabled. Enabling
  [`binlog_direct_non_transactional_updates`](replication-options-binary-log.md#sysvar_binlog_direct_non_transactional_updates)
  causes updates to nontransactional tables to be written
  directly to the binary log, rather than to the transaction
  cache.

  As of MySQL 8.0.14, setting the session value of this system
  variable is a restricted operation. The session user must
  have privileges sufficient to set restricted session
  variables. See [Section 7.1.9.1, “System Variable Privileges”](system-variable-privileges.md "7.1.9.1 System Variable Privileges").

  *[`binlog_direct_non_transactional_updates`](replication-options-binary-log.md#sysvar_binlog_direct_non_transactional_updates)
  works only for statements that are replicated using the
  statement-based binary logging format*; that is,
  it works only when the value of
  [`binlog_format`](replication-options-binary-log.md#sysvar_binlog_format) is
  `STATEMENT`, or when
  [`binlog_format`](replication-options-binary-log.md#sysvar_binlog_format) is
  `MIXED` and a given statement is being
  replicated using the statement-based format. This variable
  has no effect when the binary log format is
  `ROW`, or when
  [`binlog_format`](replication-options-binary-log.md#sysvar_binlog_format) is set to
  `MIXED` and a given statement is replicated
  using the row-based format.

  Important

  Before enabling this variable, you must make certain that
  there are no dependencies between transactional and
  nontransactional tables; an example of such a dependency
  would be the statement `INSERT INTO myisam_table
  SELECT * FROM innodb_table`. Otherwise, such
  statements are likely to cause the replica to diverge from
  the source.

  This variable has no effect when the binary log format is
  `ROW` or `MIXED`.

  | Type | Boolean |
  | Default Value | `OFF` |

  Enables encryption for binary log files and relay log files
  on this server. `OFF` is the default.
  `ON` sets encryption on for binary log
  files and relay log files. Binary logging does not need to
  be enabled on the server to enable encryption, so you can
  encrypt the relay log files on a replica that has no binary
  log. To use encryption, a keyring plugin must be installed
  and configured to supply MySQL Server's keyring service. For
  instructions to do this, see [Section 8.4.4, “The MySQL Keyring”](keyring.md "8.4.4 The MySQL Keyring"). Any
  supported keyring plugin can be used to store binary log
  encryption keys.

  When you first start the server with binary log encryption
  enabled, a new binary log encryption key is generated before
  the binary log and relay logs are initialized. This key is
  used to encrypt a file password for each binary log file (if
  the server has binary logging enabled) and relay log file
  (if the server has replication channels), and further keys
  generated from the file passwords are used to encrypt the
  data in the files. Relay log files are encrypted for all
  channels, including Group Replication applier channels and
  new channels that are created after encryption is activated.
  The binary log index file and relay log index file are never
  encrypted.

  If you activate encryption while the server is running, a
  new binary log encryption key is generated at that time. The
  exception is if encryption was active previously on the
  server and was then disabled, in which case the binary log
  encryption key that was in use before is used again. The
  binary log file and relay log files are rotated immediately,
  and file passwords for the new files and all subsequent
  binary log files and relay log files are encrypted using
  this binary log encryption key. Existing binary log files
  and relay log files still present on the server are not
  automatically encrypted, but you can purge them if they are
  no longer needed.

  If you deactivate encryption by changing the
  [`binlog_encryption`](replication-options-binary-log.md#sysvar_binlog_encryption) system
  variable to `OFF`, the binary log file and
  relay log files are rotated immediately and all subsequent
  logging is unencrypted. Previously encrypted files are not
  automatically decrypted, but the server is still able to
  read them. The `BINLOG_ENCRYPTION_ADMIN`
  privilege (or the deprecated
  [`SUPER`](privileges-provided.md#priv_super) privilege) is required
  to activate or deactivate encryption while the server is
  running. Group Replication applier channels are not included
  in the relay log rotation request, so unencrypted logging
  for these channels does not start until their logs are
  rotated in normal use.

  For more information on binary log file and relay log file
  encryption, see
  [Section 19.3.2, “Encrypting Binary Log Files and Relay Log Files”](replication-binlog-encryption.md "19.3.2 Encrypting Binary Log Files and Relay Log Files").

  | Valid Values | `IGNORE_ERROR`  `ABORT_SERVER` |

  Controls what happens when the server encounters an error
  such as not being able to write to, flush or synchronize the
  binary log, which can cause the source's binary log to
  become inconsistent and replicas to lose synchronization.

  This variable defaults to `ABORT_SERVER`,
  which makes the server halt logging and shut down whenever
  it encounters such an error with the binary log. On restart,
  recovery proceeds as in the case of an unexpected server
  halt (see
  [Section 19.4.2, “Handling an Unexpected Halt of a Replica”](replication-solutions-unexpected-replica-halt.md "19.4.2 Handling an Unexpected Halt of a Replica")).

  When `binlog_error_action` is set to
  `IGNORE_ERROR`, if the server encounters
  such an error it continues the ongoing transaction, logs the
  error then halts logging, and continues performing updates.
  To resume binary logging
  [`log_bin`](replication-options-binary-log.md#sysvar_log_bin) must be enabled
  again, which requires a server restart. This setting
  provides backward compatibility with older versions of
  MySQL.

  | Maximum Value | `4294967295` |
  | Unit | seconds |

  Sets the binary log expiration period in seconds. After
  their expiration period ends, binary log files can be
  automatically removed. Possible removals happen at startup
  and when the binary log is flushed. Log flushing occurs as
  indicated in [Section 7.4, “MySQL Server Logs”](server-logs.md "7.4 MySQL Server Logs").

  The default binary log expiration period is 2592000 seconds,
  which equals 30 days (30\*24\*60\*60 seconds). The default
  applies if neither
  `binlog_expire_logs_seconds` nor the
  deprecated system variable
  [`expire_logs_days`](replication-options-binary-log.md#sysvar_expire_logs_days) has a
  value set at startup. If a non-zero value for one of the
  variables `binlog_expire_logs_seconds` or
  `expire_logs_days` is set at startup, this
  value is used as the binary log expiration period. If a
  non-zero value for both of those variables is set at
  startup, the value for
  `binlog_expire_logs_seconds` is used as the
  binary log expiration period, and the value for
  `expire_logs_days` is ignored with a
  warning message.

  At runtime, you cannot set
  `binlog_expire_logs_seconds` or
  `expire_logs_days` to a non-zero value if
  the other is currently set to a non-zero value. Because the
  default value for
  `binlog_expire_logs_seconds` is non-zero,
  you must explicitly set
  `binlog_expire_logs_seconds` to zero before
  you can set or change the value of
  `expire_logs_days`.

  Beginning with MySQL 8.0.29, automatic purging of the binary
  log can be disabled by setting the
  [`binlog_expire_logs_auto_purge`](replication-options-binary-log.md#sysvar_binlog_expire_logs_auto_purge)
  system variable to `OFF`. This takes
  precedence over any setting for
  `binlog_expire_logs_seconds`.

  In MySQL 8.0.28 and earlier, to disable automatic purging of
  the binary log, specify a value of 0 explicitly for
  `binlog_expire_logs_seconds`, and do not
  specify a value for `expire_logs_days`. For
  compatibility with earlier releases, automatic purging is
  also disabled if you specify a value of 0 explicitly for
  `expire_logs_days` and do not specify a
  value for `binlog_expire_logs_seconds`. In
  that case, the default for
  `binlog_expire_logs_seconds` is not
  applied.

  To remove binary log files manually, use the
  [`PURGE BINARY LOGS`](purge-binary-logs.md "15.4.1.1 PURGE BINARY LOGS Statement") statement.
  See [Section 15.4.1.1, “PURGE BINARY LOGS Statement”](purge-binary-logs.md "15.4.1.1 PURGE BINARY LOGS Statement").

  Enables or disables automatic purging of binary log files.
  Setting this variable to `ON` (the default)
  enables automatic purging; setting it to
  `OFF` disables automatic purging. The
  interval to wait before purging is controlled by
  [`binlog_expire_logs_seconds`](replication-options-binary-log.md#sysvar_binlog_expire_logs_seconds)
  and [`expire_logs_days`](replication-options-binary-log.md#sysvar_expire_logs_days).

  Note

  Even if `binlog_expire_logs_auto_purge`
  is `ON`, setting both
  `binlog_expire_logs_seconds` and
  `expire_logs_days` to
  `0` stops automatic purging from taking
  place.

  This variable has no effect on [`PURGE
  BINARY LOGS`](purge-binary-logs.md "15.4.1.1 PURGE BINARY LOGS Statement").

  | Type | Enumeration |
  | Default Value | `ROW` |
  | Valid Values | `MIXED`  `STATEMENT`  `ROW` |

  This system variable sets the binary logging format, and can
  be any one of `STATEMENT`,
  `ROW`, or `MIXED`. (See
  [Section 19.2.1, “Replication Formats”](replication-formats.md "19.2.1 Replication Formats").) The setting takes
  effect when binary logging is enabled on the server, which
  is the case when the
  [`log_bin`](replication-options-binary-log.md#sysvar_log_bin) system variable is
  set to `ON`. In MySQL 8.0, binary logging
  is enabled by default, and by default uses the row-based
  format.

  Note

  `binlog_format` is deprecated as of MySQL
  8.0.34, and is subject to removal in a future version of
  MySQL. This implies that support for logging formats other
  than row-based is also subject to removal in a future
  release. Thus, only row-based logging should be employed
  for any new MySQL Replication setups.

  [`binlog_format`](replication-options-binary-log.md#sysvar_binlog_format) can be set at
  startup or at runtime, except that under some conditions,
  changing this variable at runtime is not possible or causes
  replication to fail, as described later.

  The default is `ROW`.
  *Exception*: In NDB Cluster, the default
  is `MIXED`; statement-based replication is
  not supported for NDB Cluster.

  Setting the session value of this system variable is a
  restricted operation. The session user must have privileges
  sufficient to set restricted session variables. See
  [Section 7.1.9.1, “System Variable Privileges”](system-variable-privileges.md "7.1.9.1 System Variable Privileges").

  The rules governing when changes to this variable take
  effect and how long the effect lasts are the same as for
  other MySQL server system variables. For more information,
  see [Section 15.7.6.1, “SET Syntax for Variable Assignment”](set-variable.md "15.7.6.1 SET Syntax for Variable Assignment").

  When `MIXED` is specified, statement-based
  replication is used, except for cases where only row-based
  replication is guaranteed to lead to proper results. For
  example, this happens when statements contain loadable
  functions or the [`UUID()`](miscellaneous-functions.md#function_uuid)
  function.

  For details of how stored programs (stored procedures and
  functions, triggers, and events) are handled when each
  binary logging format is set, see
  [Section 27.7, “Stored Program Binary Logging”](stored-programs-logging.md "27.7 Stored Program Binary Logging").

  There are exceptions when you cannot switch the replication
  format at runtime:

  - The replication format cannot be changed from within a
    stored function or a trigger.
  - If a session has open temporary tables, the replication
    format cannot be changed for the session (`SET
    @@SESSION.binlog_format`).
  - If any replication channel has open temporary tables,
    the replication format cannot be changed globally
    (`SET @@GLOBAL.binlog_format` or
    `SET @@PERSIST.binlog_format`).
  - If any replication channel applier thread is currently
    running, the replication format cannot be changed
    globally (`SET @@GLOBAL.binlog_format`
    or `SET @@PERSIST.binlog_format`).

  Trying to switch the replication format in any of these
  cases (or attempting to set the current replication format)
  results in an error. You can, however, use
  `PERSIST_ONLY` (`SET
  @@PERSIST_ONLY.binlog_format`) to change the
  replication format at any time, because this action does not
  modify the runtime global system variable value, and takes
  effect only after a server restart.

  Switching the replication format at runtime is not
  recommended when any temporary tables exist, because
  temporary tables are logged only when using statement-based
  replication, whereas with row-based replication and mixed
  replication, they are not logged.

  Changing the logging format on a replication source server
  does not cause a replica to change its logging format to
  match. Switching the replication format while replication is
  ongoing can cause issues if a replica has binary logging
  enabled, and the change results in the replica using
  `STATEMENT` format logging while the source
  is using `ROW` or `MIXED`
  format logging. A replica is not able to convert binary log
  entries received in `ROW` logging format to
  `STATEMENT` format for use in its own
  binary log, so this situation can cause replication to fail.
  For more information, see
  [Section 7.4.4.2, “Setting The Binary Log Format”](binary-log-setting.md "7.4.4.2 Setting The Binary Log Format").

  The binary log format affects the behavior of the following
  server options:

  - [`--replicate-do-db`](replication-options-replica.md#option_mysqld_replicate-do-db)
  - [`--replicate-ignore-db`](replication-options-replica.md#option_mysqld_replicate-ignore-db)
  - [`--binlog-do-db`](replication-options-binary-log.md#option_mysqld_binlog-do-db)
  - [`--binlog-ignore-db`](replication-options-binary-log.md#option_mysqld_binlog-ignore-db)

  These effects are discussed in detail in the descriptions of
  the individual options.

  | Minimum Value | `0` |
  | Maximum Value | `1000000` |
  | Unit | microseconds |

  Controls how many microseconds the binary log commit waits
  before synchronizing the binary log file to disk. By default
  [`binlog_group_commit_sync_delay`](replication-options-binary-log.md#sysvar_binlog_group_commit_sync_delay)
  is set to 0, meaning that there is no delay. Setting
  [`binlog_group_commit_sync_delay`](replication-options-binary-log.md#sysvar_binlog_group_commit_sync_delay)
  to a microsecond delay enables more transactions to be
  synchronized together to disk at once, reducing the overall
  time to commit a group of transactions because the larger
  groups require fewer time units per group.

  When [`sync_binlog=0`](replication-options-binary-log.md#sysvar_sync_binlog) or
  [`sync_binlog=1`](replication-options-binary-log.md#sysvar_sync_binlog) is set, the
  delay specified by
  [`binlog_group_commit_sync_delay`](replication-options-binary-log.md#sysvar_binlog_group_commit_sync_delay)
  is applied for every binary log commit group before
  synchronization (or in the case of
  [`sync_binlog=0`](replication-options-binary-log.md#sysvar_sync_binlog), before
  proceeding). When
  [`sync_binlog`](replication-options-binary-log.md#sysvar_sync_binlog) is set to a
  value *n* greater than 1, the delay is
  applied after every *n* binary log commit
  groups.

  Setting
  [`binlog_group_commit_sync_delay`](replication-options-binary-log.md#sysvar_binlog_group_commit_sync_delay)
  can increase the number of parallel committing transactions
  on any server that has (or might have after a failover) a
  replica, and therefore can increase parallel execution on
  the replicas. To benefit from this effect, the replica
  servers must have
  [`replica_parallel_type=LOGICAL_CLOCK`](replication-options-replica.md#sysvar_replica_parallel_type)
  (from MySQL 8.0.26) or
  [`slave_parallel_type=LOGICAL_CLOCK`](replication-options-replica.md#sysvar_slave_parallel_type)
  set, and the effect is more significant when
  [`binlog_transaction_dependency_tracking=COMMIT_ORDER`](replication-options-binary-log.md#sysvar_binlog_transaction_dependency_tracking)
  is also set. It is important to take into account both the
  source's throughput and the replicas' throughput when you
  are tuning the setting for
  [`binlog_group_commit_sync_delay`](replication-options-binary-log.md#sysvar_binlog_group_commit_sync_delay).

  Setting
  [`binlog_group_commit_sync_delay`](replication-options-binary-log.md#sysvar_binlog_group_commit_sync_delay)
  can also reduce the number of `fsync()`
  calls to the binary log on any server (source or replica)
  that has a binary log.

  Note that setting
  [`binlog_group_commit_sync_delay`](replication-options-binary-log.md#sysvar_binlog_group_commit_sync_delay)
  increases the latency of transactions on the server, which
  might affect client applications. Also, on highly concurrent
  workloads, it is possible for the delay to increase
  contention and therefore reduce throughput. Typically, the
  benefits of setting a delay outweigh the drawbacks, but
  tuning should always be carried out to determine the optimal
  setting.

  When this variable is enabled on a replication source server
  (which is the default), transaction commit instructions
  issued to storage engines are serialized on a single thread,
  so that transactions are always committed in the same order
  as they are written to the binary log. Disabling this
  variable permits transaction commit instructions to be
  issued using multiple threads. Used in combination with
  binary log group commit, this prevents the commit rate of a
  single transaction being a bottleneck to throughput, and
  might therefore produce a performance improvement.

  Transactions are written to the binary log at the point when
  all the storage engines involved have confirmed that the
  transaction is prepared to commit. The binary log group
  commit logic then commits a group of transactions after
  their binary log write has taken place. When
  [`binlog_order_commits`](replication-options-binary-log.md#sysvar_binlog_order_commits) is
  disabled, because multiple threads are used for this
  process, transactions in a commit group might be committed
  in a different order from their order in the binary log.
  (Transactions from a single client always commit in
  chronological order.) In many cases this does not matter, as
  operations carried out in separate transactions should
  produce consistent results, and if that is not the case, a
  single transaction ought to be used instead.

  If you want to ensure that the transaction history on the
  source and on a multithreaded replica remains identical, set
  [`slave_preserve_commit_order=1`](replication-options-replica.md#sysvar_slave_preserve_commit_order)
  on the replica.

  Specifies whether or not the binary log master key is
  rotated at server startup. The binary log master key is the
  binary log encryption key that is used to encrypt file
  passwords for the binary log files and relay log files on
  the server. When a server is started for the first time with
  binary log encryption enabled
  ([`binlog_encryption=ON`](replication-options-binary-log.md#sysvar_binlog_encryption)), a

  When row-based binary logging is used, this setting is a
  soft limit on the maximum size of a row-based binary log
  event, in bytes. Where possible, rows stored in the binary
  log are grouped into events with a size not exceeding the
  value of this setting. If an event cannot be split, the
  maximum size can be exceeded. The default is 8192 bytes.

  This global system variable is read-only and can be set only
  at server startup. Its value can therefore only be modified
  by using the `PERSIST_ONLY` keyword or the
  `@@persist_only` qualifier with the
  [`SET`](set.md "13.3.6 The SET Type") statement.

  For MySQL row-based replication, this variable determines
  how row images are written to the binary log.

  Setting the session value of this system variable is a
  restricted operation. The session user must have privileges
  sufficient to set restricted session variables. See
  [Section 7.1.9.1, “System Variable Privileges”](system-variable-privileges.md "7.1.9.1 System Variable Privileges").

  In MySQL row-based replication, each row change event
  contains two images, a “before” image whose
  columns are matched against when searching for the row to be
  updated, and an “after” image containing the
  changes. Normally, MySQL logs full rows (that is, all
  columns) for both the before and after images. However, it
  is not strictly necessary to include every column in both
  images, and we can often save disk, memory, and network
  usage by logging only those columns which are actually
  required.

  Note

  When deleting a row, only the before image is logged,
  since there are no changed values to propagate following
  the deletion. When inserting a row, only the after image
  is logged, since there is no existing row to be matched.
  Only when updating a row are both the before and after
  images required, and both written to the binary log.

  For the before image, it is necessary only that the minimum
  set of columns required to uniquely identify rows is logged.
  If the table containing the row has a primary key, then only
  the primary key column or columns are written to the binary
  log. Otherwise, if the table has a unique key all of whose
  columns are `NOT NULL`, then only the
  columns in the unique key need be logged. (If the table has
  neither a primary key nor a unique key without any
  `NULL` columns, then all columns must be
  used in the before image, and logged.) In the after image,
  it is necessary to log only the columns which have actually
  changed.

  You can cause the server to log full or minimal rows using
  the `binlog_row_image` system variable.
  This variable actually takes one of three possible values,
  as shown in the following list:

  - `full`: Log all columns in both the
    before image and the after image.
  - `minimal`: Log only those columns in
    the before image that are required to identify the row
    to be changed; log only those columns in the after image
    where a value was specified by the SQL statement, or
    generated by auto-increment.
  - `noblob`: Log all columns (same as
    `full`), except for
    [`BLOB`](blob.md "13.3.4 The BLOB and TEXT Types") and
    [`TEXT`](blob.md "13.3.4 The BLOB and TEXT Types") columns that are not
    required to identify rows, or that have not changed.

  Note

  This variable is not supported by NDB Cluster; setting it
  has no effect on the logging of
  [`NDB`](mysql-cluster.md "Chapter 25 MySQL NDB Cluster 8.0") tables.

  The default value is `full`.

  When using `minimal` or
  `noblob`, deletes and updates are
  guaranteed to work correctly for a given table if and only
  if the following conditions are true for both the source and
  destination tables:

  - All columns must be present and in the same order; each
    column must use the same data type as its counterpart in
    the other table.
  - The tables must have identical primary key definitions.

  (In other words, the tables must be identical with the
  possible exception of indexes that are not part of the
  tables' primary keys.)

  If these conditions are not met, it is possible that the
  primary key column values in the destination table may prove
  insufficient to provide a unique match for a delete or
  update. In this event, no warning or error is issued; the
  source and replica silently diverge, thus breaking
  consistency.

  Setting this variable has no effect when the binary logging
  format is `STATEMENT`. When
  [`binlog_format`](replication-options-binary-log.md#sysvar_binlog_format) is
  `MIXED`, the setting for
  `binlog_row_image` is applied to changes
  that are logged using row-based format, but this setting has
  no effect on changes logged as statements.

  Setting `binlog_row_image` on either the
  global or session level does not cause an implicit commit;
  this means that this variable can be changed while a
  transaction is in progress without affecting the
  transaction.

  | Type | Enumeration |
  | Default Value | `MINIMAL` |
  | Valid Values | `FULL` (All metadata is included)  `MINIMAL` (Limit included metadata) |

  Configures the amount of table metadata added to the binary
  log when using row-based logging. When set to
  `MINIMAL`, the default, only metadata
  related to `SIGNED` flags, column character
  set and geometry types are logged. When set to
  `FULL` complete metadata for tables is
  logged, such as column name,
  [`ENUM`](enum.md "13.3.5 The ENUM Type") or
  `SET` string values, `PRIMARY
  KEY` information, and so on.

  The extended metadata serves the following purposes:

  - Replicas use the metadata to transfer data when its
    table structure is different from the source's.
  - External software can use the metadata to decode row
    events and store the data into external databases, such
    as a data warehouse.

  | Type | Set |

  | Valid Values | `PARTIAL_JSON` |

  When set to `PARTIAL_JSON`, this enables
  use of a space-efficient binary log format for updates that
  modify only a small portion of a JSON document, which causes
  row-based replication to write only the modified parts of
  the JSON document to the after-image for the update in the
  binary log, rather than writing the full document (see
  [Partial Updates of JSON Values](json.md#json-partial-updates "Partial Updates of JSON Values")). This works for an
  [`UPDATE`](update.md "15.2.17 UPDATE Statement") statement which
  modifies a JSON column using any sequence of
  [`JSON_SET()`](json-modification-functions.md#function_json-set),
  [`JSON_REPLACE()`](json-modification-functions.md#function_json-replace), and
  [`JSON_REMOVE()`](json-modification-functions.md#function_json-remove). If the server
  is unable to generate a partial update, the full document is
  used instead.

  The default value is an empty string, which disables use of
  the format. To unset
  `binlog_row_value_options` and revert to
  writing the full JSON document, set its value to the empty
  string.

  Setting the session value of this system variable is a
  restricted operation. The session user must have privileges
  sufficient to set restricted session variables. See
  [Section 7.1.9.1, “System Variable Privileges”](system-variable-privileges.md "7.1.9.1 System Variable Privileges").

  `binlog_row_value_options=PARTIAL_JSON`
  takes effect only when binary logging is enabled and
  [`binlog_format`](replication-options-binary-log.md#sysvar_binlog_format) is set to
  `ROW` or `MIXED`.
  Statement-based replication *always* logs
  only the modified parts of the JSON document, regardless of
  any value set for
  `binlog_row_value_options`. To maximize the
  amount of space saved, use
  [`binlog_row_image=NOBLOB`](replication-options-binary-log.md#sysvar_binlog_row_image) or
  `binlog_row_image=MINIMAL` together with
  this option. `binlog_row_image=FULL` saves
  less space than either of these, since the full JSON
  document is stored in the before-image, and the partial
  update is stored only in the after-image.

  [**mysqlbinlog**](mysqlbinlog.md "6.6.9 mysqlbinlog — Utility for Processing Binary Log Files") output includes partial JSON
  updates in the form of events encoded as base-64 strings
  using [`BINLOG`](binlog.md "15.7.8.1 BINLOG Statement") statements. If
  the [`--verbose`](mysqlbinlog.md#option_mysqlbinlog_verbose) option is
  specified, [**mysqlbinlog**](mysqlbinlog.md "6.6.9 mysqlbinlog — Utility for Processing Binary Log Files") displays the
  partial JSON updates as readable JSON using pseudo-SQL
  statements.

  MySQL Replication generates an error if a modification
  cannot be applied to the JSON document on the replica. This
  includes a failure to find the path. Be aware that, even
  with this and other safety checks, if a JSON document on a
  replica has diverged from that on the source and a partial
  update is applied, it remains theoretically possible to
  produce a valid but unexpected JSON document on the replica.

  This system variable affects row-based logging only. When
  enabled, it causes the server to write informational log
  events such as row query log events into its binary log.
  This information can be used for debugging and related
  purposes, such as obtaining the original query issued on the
  source when it cannot be reconstructed from the row updates.

  Setting the session value of this system variable is a

  sufficient to set restricted session variables. See
  [Section 7.1.9.1, “System Variable Privileges”](system-variable-privileges.md "7.1.9.1 System Variable Privileges").

  These informational events are normally ignored by MySQL
  programs reading the binary log and so cause no issues when
  replicating or restoring from backup. To view them, increase
  the verbosity level by using mysqlbinlog's
  [`--verbose`](mysqlbinlog.md#option_mysqlbinlog_verbose) option twice,

  The size of the memory buffer for the binary log to hold
  nontransactional statements issued during a transaction.

  When binary logging is enabled on the server (with the
  [`log_bin`](replication-options-binary-log.md#sysvar_log_bin) system variable set
  to ON), separate binary log transaction and statement caches
  are allocated for each client if the server supports any
  transactional storage engines. If the data for the
  nontransactional statements used in the transaction exceeds
  the space in the memory buffer, the excess data is stored in
  a temporary file. When binary log encryption is active on
  the server, the memory buffer is not encrypted, but (from
  MySQL 8.0.17) any temporary file used to hold the binary log
  cache is encrypted. After each transaction is committed, the
  binary log statement cache is reset by clearing the memory
  buffer and truncating the temporary file if used.

  If you often use large nontransactional statements during
  transactions, you can increase this cache size to get better
  performance by reducing or eliminating the need to write to
  temporary files. The
  [`Binlog_stmt_cache_use`](server-status-variables.md#statvar_Binlog_stmt_cache_use) and
  [`Binlog_stmt_cache_disk_use`](server-status-variables.md#statvar_Binlog_stmt_cache_disk_use)
  status variables can be useful for tuning the size of this
  variable. See [Section 7.4.4, “The Binary Log”](binary-log.md "7.4.4 The Binary Log").

  The [`binlog_cache_size`](replication-options-binary-log.md#sysvar_binlog_cache_size)
  system variable sets the size for the transaction cache.

  Enables compression for transactions that are written to
  binary log files on this server. `OFF` is
  the default. Use the
  [`binlog_transaction_compression_level_zstd`](replication-options-binary-log.md#sysvar_binlog_transaction_compression_level_zstd)
  system variable to set the level for the
  `zstd` algorithm that is used for
  compression.

  Setting
  [`binlog_transaction_compression`](replication-options-binary-log.md#sysvar_binlog_transaction_compression)
  has no immediate effect but rather applies to all subsequent
  [`START REPLICA`](start-replica.md "15.4.2.6 START REPLICA Statement")
  ([`START SLAVE`](start-slave.md "15.4.2.7 START SLAVE Statement")) statements.

  When binary log transaction compression is enabled,
  transaction payloads are compressed and then written to the
  binary log file as a single event
  (`Transaction_payload_event`). Compressed
  transaction payloads remain in a compressed state while they
  are sent in the replication stream to replicas, other Group
  Replication group members, or clients such as
  [**mysqlbinlog**](mysqlbinlog.md "6.6.9 mysqlbinlog — Utility for Processing Binary Log Files"), and are written to the relay
  log still in their compressed state. Binary log transaction
  compression therefore saves storage space both on the
  originator of the transaction and on the recipient (and for
  their backups), and saves network bandwidth when the
  transactions are sent between server instances.

  For `binlog_transaction_compression=ON` to
  have a direct effect, binary logging must be enabled on the
  server. When a MySQL server instance has no binary log, if
  it is at a release from MySQL 8.0.20, it can receive,
  handle, and display compressed transaction payloads
  regardless of its value for
  [`binlog_transaction_compression`](replication-options-binary-log.md#sysvar_binlog_transaction_compression).
  Compressed transaction payloads received by such server
  instances are written in their compressed state to the relay
  log, so they benefit indirectly from compression carried out
  by other servers in the replication topology.

  This system variable cannot be changed within the context of
  a transaction. Setting the session value of this system
  variable is a restricted operation. The session user must
  have privileges sufficient to set restricted session
  variables. See [Section 7.1.9.1, “System Variable Privileges”](system-variable-privileges.md "7.1.9.1 System Variable Privileges").

  For more information on binary log transaction compression,
  including details of what events are and are not compressed,
  and changes in behavior when transaction compression is in
  use, see
  [Section 7.4.4.5, “Binary Log Transaction Compression”](binary-log-transaction-compression.md "7.4.4.5 Binary Log Transaction Compression").

  *Prior to NDB 8.0.31*: Setting this
  variable when the server is running has no effect on logging
  of transactions on [`NDB`](mysql-cluster.md "Chapter 25 MySQL NDB Cluster 8.0") tables.
  Binary log transaction compression can be enabled for
  `NDB` tables by starting MySQL with
  [`--binlog-transaction-compression=ON`](replication-options-binary-log.md#sysvar_binlog_transaction_compression)
  on the command line or in an option file but cannot be
  enabled or disabled while the server is running.

  *In NDB 8.0.31 and later*: You can use
  the
  [`ndb_log_transaction_compression`](mysql-cluster-options-variables.md#sysvar_ndb_log_transaction_compression)
  system variable to enable this feature for
  `NDB`. In addition, setting
  `--binlog-transaction-compression=ON` on the
  command line or in a `my.cnf` file causes
  `ndb_log_transaction_compression` to be
  enabled on server startup. See the description of the
  variable for further information.

  Sets the compression level for binary log transaction
  compression on this server, which is enabled by the
  [`binlog_transaction_compression`](replication-options-binary-log.md#sysvar_binlog_transaction_compression)
  system variable. The value is an integer that determines the
  compression effort, from 1 (the lowest effort) to 22 (the
  highest effort). If you do not specify this system variable,
  the compression level is set to 3.

  Setting
  [`binlog_transaction_compression_level_zstd`](replication-options-binary-log.md#sysvar_binlog_transaction_compression_level_zstd)

  [`START REPLICA`](start-replica.md "15.4.2.6 START REPLICA Statement")
  ([`START SLAVE`](start-slave.md "15.4.2.7 START SLAVE Statement")) statements.

  As the compression level increases, the data compression
  ratio increases, which reduces the storage space and network
  bandwidth required for the transaction payload. However, the
  effort required for data compression also increases, taking
  time and CPU and memory resources on the originating server.
  Increases in the compression effort do not have a linear
  relationship to increases in the data compression ratio.

  This system variable cannot be changed within the context of

  For a replication source server that has multithreaded
  replicas (replicas on which
  [`replica_parallel_workers`](replication-options-replica.md#sysvar_replica_parallel_workers) or
  [`slave_parallel_workers`](replication-options-replica.md#sysvar_slave_parallel_workers) is
  is greater than 0),
  `binlog_transaction_dependency_tracking`
  specifies how the source [**mysqld**](mysqld.md "6.3.1 mysqld — The MySQL Server") generates
  the dependency information that it writes in the binary log
  to help replicas determine which transactions can be
  executed in parallel.

  The dependency information written by the replication source
  is represented using logical timestamps. (Thus, setting this
  variable requires that
  [`replica_parallel_type`](replication-options-replica.md#sysvar_replica_parallel_type) or
  [`slave_parallel_type`](replication-options-replica.md#sysvar_slave_parallel_type) already
  be set to `LOGICAL_CLOCK`.) There are two
  logical timestamps, listed here, for each transaction:

  - `sequence_number`: This is 1 for the
    first transaction in a given binary log, 2 for the
    second transaction, and so on. The numbering restarts
    with 1 in each binary log file.
  - `last_committed`: This refers to the
    `sequence_number` of the most recently
    committed transaction found to conflict with the current
    transaction. This value is always less than
    `sequence_number`.

  `binlog_transaction_dependency_tracking`
  controls the choice of scheme used to compute these logical
  timestamps. Available choices are listed here:

  - `COMMIT_ORDER`: Two transactions are
    considered to be independent if the commit-time window
    of the first transaction overlaps with the commit-time
    window of the second transaction. This the default.

    The commit-time window begins immediately following the
    execution of the last statement of the transaction, and
    ends immediately before the storage engine commit ends.
    Since transactions hold all row locks between these two
    points in time, we know that they cannot update the same
    rows.
  - `WRITESET`: Logical timestamps are
    computed based on `COMMIT_ORDER` in
    combination with a second scheme based on write sets for
    the transaction. Each row in the transaction adds a set
    of one or more hashes to the transaction's write
    set, one of each unique key in the row. (If there are no
    unique, nonnullable keys, a hash of the row is used.)
    This includes both deleted and inserted rows; for
    updated rows, both the old and the new row are also
    included.

    Two transactions are considered conflicting if their
    write sets overlap—that is, if there is some
    number (hash) that occurs in the write sets of both
    transactions. In addition, due to the way the write sets
    are computed, there are periodic serialization points,
    such that the write set computation process regards
    every transaction after a serialization point as
    conflicting with every transaction before the
    serialization point. Serialization points affect only
    dependencies computed by the `WRITESET`
    algorithm; transactions on opposite sides of the
    serialization point may have overlapping commit-time
    windows, and so can be parallelized on replica in spite
    of this. Serialization points occur for DDL statements,
    for transactions updating a table having a foreign key,
    and for transactions where the session value of
    [`transaction_write_set_extraction`](replication-options-binary-log.md#sysvar_transaction_write_set_extraction)
    is not the same as the global value. A serialization
    point is also imposed if the transactions committed
    since the previous serialization point have generated a
    total of at least
    [`binlog_transaction_dependency_history_size`](replication-options-binary-log.md#sysvar_binlog_transaction_dependency_history_size)
    unique hashes.

    For multithreaded replicas to work with NDB Cluster
    replication (supported in NDB 8.0.33 and later), this
    variable must be set to `WRITESET` on
    the source. See
    [Section 25.7.11, “NDB Cluster Replication Using the Multithreaded Applier”](mysql-cluster-replication-mta.md "25.7.11 NDB Cluster Replication Using the Multithreaded Applier"), for
    more information.
  - `WRITESET_SESSION`: Two transactions
    are considered dependent if either of the following
    statements is true:

    - The transactions are dependent according to
      `WRITESET`.
    - The transactions were committed in the same user
      session.

  In `WRITESET` or
  `WRITESET_SESSION` mode, the source uses
  `COMMIT_ORDER` to generate dependency
  information for transactions that have empty or partial
  write sets, transactions that update tables without primary
  or unique keys, and transactions that update parent tables
  in a foreign key relationship.

  To set
  `binlog_transaction_dependency_tracking` to
  `WRITESET` or
  `WRITESET_SESSION`,
  [`transaction_write_set_extraction`](replication-options-binary-log.md#sysvar_transaction_write_set_extraction)
  must be set to a value other than `OFF`;
  the default value (`XXHASH64`) is
  sufficient for this.
  `transaction_write_set_extraction` cannot
  be changed whenever the value of
  `binlog_transaction_dependency_tracking` is
  `WRITESET` or
  `WRITESET_SESSION`. Any change in the value
  does not take effect for replicated transactions until after
  the replica has been stopped and restarted with
  [`STOP REPLICA`](stop-replica.md "15.4.2.8 STOP REPLICA Statement") and
  [`START REPLICA`](start-replica.md "15.4.2.6 START REPLICA Statement").

  The number of row hashes to be kept and checked for the
  latest transaction to have changed a given row is determined
  by the value of
  [`binlog_transaction_dependency_history_size`](replication-options-binary-log.md#sysvar_binlog_transaction_dependency_history_size).

  Group Replication carries out its own parallelization after
  certification when applying transactions from the relay log,
  independently of any value set for
  `binlog_transaction_dependency_tracking`,
  but this variable does affect how transactions are written
  to the binary logs on Group Replication members. The
  dependency information in those logs is used to assist the
  process of state transfer from a donor's binary log for
  distributed recovery, which takes place whenever a member
  joins or rejoins the group. For that process, setting
  `binlog_transaction_dependency_tracking` to
  `WRITESET` can improve performance for a
  group member, depending on the group's workload.

  | Unit | days |

  Specifies the number of days before automatic removal of
  binary log files.
  [`expire_logs_days`](replication-options-binary-log.md#sysvar_expire_logs_days) is
  deprecated, and you should expect it to be removed in a
  future release. Instead, use
  [`binlog_expire_logs_seconds`](replication-options-binary-log.md#sysvar_binlog_expire_logs_seconds),
  which sets the binary log expiration period in seconds. If
  you do not set a value for either system variable, the
  default expiration period is 30 days. Possible removals
  happen at startup and when the binary log is flushed. Log
  flushing occurs as indicated in
  [Section 7.4, “MySQL Server Logs”](server-logs.md "7.4 MySQL Server Logs").

  Any non-zero value that you specify at startup for
  [`expire_logs_days`](replication-options-binary-log.md#sysvar_expire_logs_days) is ignored
  if
  [`binlog_expire_logs_seconds`](replication-options-binary-log.md#sysvar_binlog_expire_logs_seconds)
  is also specified, and the value of
  [`binlog_expire_logs_seconds`](replication-options-binary-log.md#sysvar_binlog_expire_logs_seconds)
  is used instead as the binary log expiration period. A
  warning message is issued in this situation. A non-zero
  startup value for
  [`expire_logs_days`](replication-options-binary-log.md#sysvar_expire_logs_days)
  is only applied as the binary log expiration period if
  [`binlog_expire_logs_seconds`](replication-options-binary-log.md#sysvar_binlog_expire_logs_seconds)
  is not specified or is specified as 0.

  At runtime, you cannot set
  [`binlog_expire_logs_seconds`](replication-options-binary-log.md#sysvar_binlog_expire_logs_seconds)
  or [`expire_logs_days`](replication-options-binary-log.md#sysvar_expire_logs_days) to a
  non-zero value if the other is currently set to a non-zero
  value. Because the default value for
  [`binlog_expire_logs_seconds`](replication-options-binary-log.md#sysvar_binlog_expire_logs_seconds)
  is non-zero, you must explicitly set
  [`binlog_expire_logs_seconds`](replication-options-binary-log.md#sysvar_binlog_expire_logs_seconds)
  to zero before you can set or change the value of
  [`expire_logs_days`](replication-options-binary-log.md#sysvar_expire_logs_days).

  To disable automatic purging of the binary log, specify a
  value of 0 explicitly for
  [`binlog_expire_logs_seconds`](replication-options-binary-log.md#sysvar_binlog_expire_logs_seconds),
  and do not specify a value for
  [`expire_logs_days`](replication-options-binary-log.md#sysvar_expire_logs_days). For
  compatibility with earlier releases, automatic purging is
  also disabled if you specify a value of 0 explicitly for
  [`expire_logs_days`](replication-options-binary-log.md#sysvar_expire_logs_days) and do not
  specify a value for
  [`binlog_expire_logs_seconds`](replication-options-binary-log.md#sysvar_binlog_expire_logs_seconds).
  In that case, the default for
  [`binlog_expire_logs_seconds`](replication-options-binary-log.md#sysvar_binlog_expire_logs_seconds)
  is not applied.

  To remove binary log files manually, use the
  [`PURGE BINARY LOGS`](purge-binary-logs.md "15.4.1.1 PURGE BINARY LOGS Statement") statement.
  See [Section 15.4.1.1, “PURGE BINARY LOGS Statement”](purge-binary-logs.md "15.4.1.1 PURGE BINARY LOGS Statement").

  | [`SET_VAR`](optimizer-hints.md#optimizer-hints-set-var "Variable-Setting Hint Syntax") Hint Applies | No |
  | Type | Boolean |

  Shows the status of binary logging on the server, either
  enabled (`ON`) or disabled
  (`OFF`). With binary logging enabled, the
  server logs all statements that change data to the binary
  log, which is used for backup and replication.
  `ON` means that the binary log is
  available, `OFF` means that it is not in
  use. The [`--log-bin`](replication-options-binary-log.md#option_mysqld_log-bin) option can
  be used to specify a base name and location for the binary
  log.

  In earlier MySQL versions, binary logging was disabled by
  default, and was enabled if you specified the
  `--log-bin` option. From MySQL 8.0, binary
  logging is enabled by default, with the
  `log_bin` system variable set to
  `ON`, whether or not you specify the
  `--log-bin` option. The exception is if you
  use [**mysqld**](mysqld.md "6.3.1 mysqld — The MySQL Server") to initialize the data
  directory manually by invoking it with the
  `--initialize` or
  `--initialize-insecure` option, when binary
  logging is disabled by default. It is possible to enable
  binary logging in this case by specifying the
  `--log-bin` option.

  If the
  [`--skip-log-bin`](replication-options-binary-log.md#option_mysqld_log-bin)
  or
  [`--disable-log-bin`](replication-options-binary-log.md#option_mysqld_log-bin)
  option is specified at startup, binary logging is disabled,
  with the `log_bin` system variable set to
  `OFF`. If either of these options is
  specified and `--log-bin` is also specified,
  the option specified later takes precedence.

  For information on the format and management of the binary
  log, see [Section 7.4.4, “The Binary Log”](binary-log.md "7.4.4 The Binary Log").

  server option. The maximum variable length is 256. In MySQL
  8.0, if the `--log-bin` option
  is not supplied, the default base name is
  `binlog`. For compatibility with MySQL
  5.7, if the `--log-bin` option is supplied
  with no string or with an empty string, the default base
  name is
  `host_name-bin`,
  using the name of the host machine. The default location is
  the data directory.

  | [`SET_VAR`](optimizer-hints.md#optimizer-hints-set-var "Variable-Setting Hint Syntax") Hint Applies | No |
  | Type | Boolean |
  | Default Value | `OFF` |

  This variable applies when binary logging is enabled. It
  controls whether stored function creators can be trusted not
  to create stored functions that may cause unsafe events to
  be written to the binary log. If set to 0 (the default),
  users are not permitted to create or alter stored functions
  unless they have the [`SUPER`](privileges-provided.md#priv_super)
  privilege in addition to the [`CREATE
  ROUTINE`](privileges-provided.md#priv_create-routine) or [`ALTER
  ROUTINE`](privileges-provided.md#priv_alter-routine) privilege. A setting of 0 also enforces
  the restriction that a function must be declared with the
  `DETERMINISTIC` characteristic, or with the
  `READS SQL DATA` or `NO
  SQL` characteristic. If the variable is set to 1,
  MySQL does not enforce these restrictions on stored function
  creation. This variable also applies to trigger creation.

  This read-only system variable is deprecated. Setting the
  system variable to `ON` at server startup
  enabled row-based replication with replicas running MySQL
  Server 5.5 and earlier by writing the binary log using
  Version 1 binary log row events, instead of Version 2 binary
  log row events which are the default as of MySQL 5.6.

  From MySQL 8.0.26, use
  [`log_replica_updates`](replication-options-binary-log.md#sysvar_log_replica_updates) in
  place of [`log_slave_updates`](replication-options-binary-log.md#sysvar_log_slave_updates),
  which is deprecated from that release. In releases before
  MySQL 8.0.26, use
  [`log_slave_updates`](replication-options-binary-log.md#sysvar_log_slave_updates).

  [`log_replica_updates`](replication-options-binary-log.md#sysvar_log_replica_updates)
  specifies whether updates received by a replica server from
  a replication source server should be logged to the
  replica's own binary log.

  Enabling this variable causes the replica to write the
  updates that are received from a source and performed by the
  replication SQL thread to the replica's own binary log.
  Binary logging, which is controlled by the
  [`--log-bin`](replication-options-binary-log.md#option_mysqld_log-bin) option and is
  enabled by default, must also be enabled on the replica for
  updates to be logged. See
  [Section 19.1.6, “Replication and Binary Logging Options and Variables”](replication-options.md "19.1.6 Replication and Binary Logging Options and Variables").
  [`log_replica_updates`](replication-options-binary-log.md#sysvar_log_replica_updates) is
  enabled by default, unless you specify
  [`--skip-log-bin`](replication-options-binary-log.md#option_mysqld_log-bin)
  to disable binary logging, in which case MySQL also disables
  replica update logging by default. If you need to disable
  replica update logging when binary logging is enabled,
  specify
  [`--log-replica-updates=OFF`](replication-options-binary-log.md#sysvar_log_replica_updates) at
  replica server startup.

  Enabling
  [`log_replica_updates`](replication-options-binary-log.md#sysvar_log_replica_updates) enables
  replication servers to be chained. For example, you might
  want to set up replication servers using this arrangement:

  ```none
  A -> B -> C
  ```

  Here, `A` serves as the source for the
  replica `B`, and `B`
  serves as the source for the replica `C`.
  For this to work, `B` must be both a source
  *and* a replica. With binary logging
  enabled and
  [`log_replica_updates`](replication-options-binary-log.md#sysvar_log_replica_updates)
  enabled, which are the default settings, updates received
  from `A` are logged by `B`
  to its binary log, and can therefore be passed on to
  `C`.

  From MySQL 8.0.26,
  [`master_verify_checksum`](replication-options-binary-log.md#sysvar_master_verify_checksum) is
  deprecated and the alias
  [`source_verify_checksum`](replication-options-binary-log.md#sysvar_source_verify_checksum)
  should be used instead. In releases before MySQL 8.0.26, use
  [`master_verify_checksum`](replication-options-binary-log.md#sysvar_master_verify_checksum).

  Enabling
  [`master_verify_checksum`](replication-options-binary-log.md#sysvar_master_verify_checksum)
  causes the source to verify events read from the binary log
  by examining checksums, and to stop with an error in the
  event of a mismatch.
  [`master_verify_checksum`](replication-options-binary-log.md#sysvar_master_verify_checksum) is
  disabled by default; in this case, the source uses the event
  length from the binary log to verify events, so that only
  complete events are read from the binary log.

  If a transaction requires more than this many bytes, the
  server generates a Multi-statement transaction
  required more than 'max\_binlog\_cache\_size' bytes of
  storage error. When
  [`gtid_mode`](replication-options-gtids.md#sysvar_gtid_mode) is not
  `ON`, the maximum recommended value is 4GB,
  due to the fact that, in this case, MySQL cannot work with
  binary log positions greater than 4GB; when
  `gtid_mode` is `ON`, this
  limitation does not apply, and the server can work with
  binary log positions of arbitrary size.

  If, because [`gtid_mode`](replication-options-gtids.md#sysvar_gtid_mode) is
  not `ON`, or for some other reason, you
  need to guarantee that the binary log does not exceed a
  given size *`maxsize`*, you should
  set this variable according to the formula shown here:

  ```simple
  max_binlog_cache_size <
    (((maxsize - max_binlog_size) / max_connections) - 1000) / 1.2
  ```

  This calculation takes into account the following
  conditions:

  - The server writes to the binary log as long as the size
    before it begins to write is less than
    [`max_binlog_size`](replication-options-binary-log.md#sysvar_max_binlog_size).
  - The server does not write single transactions, but
    rather groups of transactions. The maximum possible
    number of transactions in a group is equal to
    [`max_connections`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_max_connections).
  - The server writes data that is not included in the
    cache. This includes a 4-byte checksum for each event;
    while this adds less than 20% to the transaction size,
    this amount is non-negible. In addition, the server
    writes a `Gtid_log_event` for each
    transaction; each of these events can add another 1 KB
    to what is written to the binary log.

  `max_binlog_cache_size` sets the size for
  the transaction cache only; the upper limit for the
  statement cache is governed by the
  [`max_binlog_stmt_cache_size`](replication-options-binary-log.md#sysvar_max_binlog_stmt_cache_size)
  system variable.

  The visibility to sessions of
  `max_binlog_cache_size` matches that of the
  [`binlog_cache_size`](replication-options-binary-log.md#sysvar_binlog_cache_size) system
  variable; in other words, changing its value affects only
  new sessions that are started after the value is changed.

  If a write to the binary log causes the current log file
  size to exceed the value of this variable, the server
  rotates the binary logs (closes the current file and opens
  the next one). The minimum value is 4096 bytes. The maximum
  and default value is 1GB. Encrypted binary log files have an
  additional 512-byte header, which is included in
  [`max_binlog_size`](replication-options-binary-log.md#sysvar_max_binlog_size).

  A transaction is written in one chunk to the binary log, so
  it is never split between several binary logs. Therefore, if
  you have big transactions, you might see binary log files
  larger than
  [`max_binlog_size`](replication-options-binary-log.md#sysvar_max_binlog_size).

  If [`max_relay_log_size`](replication-options-replica.md#sysvar_max_relay_log_size) is 0,
  the value of
  [`max_binlog_size`](replication-options-binary-log.md#sysvar_max_binlog_size) applies to
  relay logs as well.

  With GTIDs in use on the server, when
  [`max_binlog_size`](replication-options-binary-log.md#sysvar_max_binlog_size) is reached,
  if the system table `mysql.gtid_executed`
  cannot be accessed to write the GTIDs from the current
  binary log file, the binary log cannot be rotated. In this
  situation, the server responds according to its
  [`binlog_error_action`](replication-options-binary-log.md#sysvar_binlog_error_action)
  setting. If `IGNORE_ERROR` is set, an error
  is logged on the server and binary logging is halted, or if
  `ABORT_SERVER` is set, the server shuts
  down.

  If nontransactional statements within a transaction require
  more than this many bytes of memory, the server generates an
  error. The minimum value is 4096. The maximum and default
  values are 4GB on 32-bit platforms and 16EB (exabytes) on
  64-bit platforms.

  `max_binlog_stmt_cache_size` sets the size
  for the statement cache only; the upper limit for the
  transaction cache is governed exclusively by the
  [`max_binlog_cache_size`](replication-options-binary-log.md#sysvar_max_binlog_cache_size)
  system variable.

  | Type | Numeric |

  For internal use by replication. When re-executing a
  transaction on a replica, this is set to the time when the
  transaction was committed on the original source, measured
  in microseconds since the epoch. This allows the original
  commit timestamp to be propagated throughout a replication
  topology.

  Setting the session value of this system variable is a
  restricted operation. The session user must have either the
  [`REPLICATION_APPLIER`](privileges-provided.md#priv_replication-applier) privilege
  (see [Section 19.3.3, “Replication Privilege Checks”](replication-privilege-checks.md "19.3.3 Replication Privilege Checks")), or
  privileges sufficient to set restricted session variables
  (see [Section 7.1.9.1, “System Variable Privileges”](system-variable-privileges.md "7.1.9.1 System Variable Privileges")). However,
  note that the variable is not intended for users to set; it
  is set automatically by the replication infrastructure.
- [`source_verify_checksum`](replication-options-binary-log.md#sysvar_source_verify_checksum)

  |  |  |
  | --- | --- |
  | Command-Line Format | `--source-verify-checksum[={OFF|ON}]` |

  | System Variable | `source_verify_checksum` |
  | Scope | Global |

  | [`SET_VAR`](optimizer-hints.md#optimizer-hints-set-var "Variable-Setting Hint Syntax") Hint Applies | No |
  | Type | Boolean |
  | Default Value | `OFF` |

  From MySQL 8.0.26, use
  [`source_verify_checksum`](replication-options-binary-log.md#sysvar_source_verify_checksum) in
  place of
  [`master_verify_checksum`](replication-options-binary-log.md#sysvar_master_verify_checksum),
  which is deprecated from that release. In releases before
  MySQL 8.0.26, use
  [`master_verify_checksum`](replication-options-binary-log.md#sysvar_master_verify_checksum).

  Enabling
  [`source_verify_checksum`](replication-options-binary-log.md#sysvar_source_verify_checksum)
  causes the source to verify events read from the binary log
  by examining checksums, and to stop with an error in the
  event of a mismatch.
  [`source_verify_checksum`](replication-options-binary-log.md#sysvar_source_verify_checksum) is
  disabled by default; in this case, the source uses the event
  length from the binary log to verify events, so that only
  complete events are read from the binary log.
- [`sql_log_bin`](replication-options-binary-log.md#sysvar_sql_log_bin)

  |  |  |
  | --- | --- |
  | System Variable | `sql_log_bin` |
  | Scope | Session |
  | Dynamic | Yes |
  | [`SET_VAR`](optimizer-hints.md#optimizer-hints-set-var "Variable-Setting Hint Syntax") Hint Applies | No |
  | Type | Boolean |
  | Default Value | `ON` |

  This variable controls whether logging to the binary log is
  enabled for the current session (assuming that the binary
  log itself is enabled). The default value is
  `ON`. To disable or enable binary logging
  for the current session, set the session
  [`sql_log_bin`](replication-options-binary-log.md#sysvar_sql_log_bin) variable to
  `OFF` or `ON`.

  Set this variable to `OFF` for a session to
  temporarily disable binary logging while making changes to
  the source you do not want replicated to the replica.

  Setting the session value of this system variable is a
  restricted operation. The session user must have privileges
  sufficient to set restricted session variables. See
  [Section 7.1.9.1, “System Variable Privileges”](system-variable-privileges.md "7.1.9.1 System Variable Privileges").

  It is not possible to set the session value of
  [`sql_log_bin`](replication-options-binary-log.md#sysvar_sql_log_bin) within a
  transaction or subquery.

  *Setting this variable to `OFF`
  prevents GTIDs from being assigned to transactions in the
  binary log*. If you are using GTIDs for
  replication, this means that even when binary logging is
  later enabled again, the GTIDs written into the log from
  this point do not account for any transactions that occurred
  in the meantime, so in effect those transactions are lost.
- [`sync_binlog`](replication-options-binary-log.md#sysvar_sync_binlog)

  Controls how often the MySQL server synchronizes the binary
  log to disk.

  - [`sync_binlog=0`](replication-options-binary-log.md#sysvar_sync_binlog): Disables
    synchronization of the binary log to disk by the MySQL
    server. Instead, the MySQL server relies on the
    operating system to flush the binary log to disk from
    time to time as it does for any other file. This setting
    provides the best performance, but in the event of a
    power failure or operating system crash, it is possible
    that the server has committed transactions that have not
    been synchronized to the binary log.
  - [`sync_binlog=1`](replication-options-binary-log.md#sysvar_sync_binlog): Enables
    synchronization of the binary log to disk before
    transactions are committed. This is the safest setting
    but can have a negative impact on performance due to the
    increased number of disk writes. In the event of a power
    failure or operating system crash, transactions that are
    missing from the binary log are only in a prepared
    state. This permits the automatic recovery routine to
    roll back the transactions, which guarantees that no
    transaction is lost from the binary log.
  - [`sync_binlog=N`](replication-options-binary-log.md#sysvar_sync_binlog),
    where *`N`* is a value other than
    0 or 1: The binary log is synchronized to disk after
    `N` binary log commit groups have been
    collected. In the event of a power failure or operating
    system crash, it is possible that the server has
    committed transactions that have not been flushed to the
    binary log. This setting can have a negative impact on
    performance due to the increased number of disk writes.
    A higher value improves performance, but with an
    increased risk of data loss.

  For the greatest possible durability and consistency in a
  replication setup that uses `InnoDB` with
  transactions, use these settings:

  - [`sync_binlog=1`](replication-options-binary-log.md#sysvar_sync_binlog).
  - [`innodb_flush_log_at_trx_commit=1`](innodb-parameters.md#sysvar_innodb_flush_log_at_trx_commit).

  Caution

  Many operating systems and some disk hardware fool the
  flush-to-disk operation. They may tell
  [**mysqld**](mysqld.md "6.3.1 mysqld — The MySQL Server") that the flush has taken place,
  even though it has not. In this case, the durability of
  transactions is not guaranteed even with the recommended
  settings, and in the worst case, a power outage can
  corrupt `InnoDB` data. Using a
  battery-backed disk cache in the SCSI disk controller or
  in the disk itself speeds up file flushes, and makes the
  operation safer. You can also try to disable the caching
  of disk writes in hardware caches.
- [`transaction_write_set_extraction`](replication-options-binary-log.md#sysvar_transaction_write_set_extraction)

  |  |  |
  | --- | --- |
  | Command-Line Format | `--transaction-write-set-extraction[=value]` |
  | Deprecated | 8.0.26 |
  | System Variable | `transaction_write_set_extraction` |
  | Scope | Global, Session |
  | Dynamic | Yes |
  | [`SET_VAR`](optimizer-hints.md#optimizer-hints-set-var "Variable-Setting Hint Syntax") Hint Applies | No |
  | Type | Enumeration |
  | Default Value | `XXHASH64` |
  | Valid Values | `OFF`  `MURMUR32`  `XXHASH64` |

  This system variable specifies the algorithm used to hash
  the writes extracted during a transaction. The default is
  `XXHASH64`. `OFF` means
  that write sets are not collected.

  `transaction_write_set_extraction` is
  deprecated as of MySQL 8.0.26; expect it to be removed in a
  future MySQL release.

  The `XXHASH64` setting is required for
  Group Replication, where the process of extracting the
  writes from a transaction is used for conflict detection and
  certification on all group members (see
  [Section 20.3.1, “Group Replication Requirements”](group-replication-requirements.md "20.3.1 Group Replication Requirements")). For a
  replication source server that has multithreaded replicas
  (replicas on which
  [`replica_parallel_workers`](replication-options-replica.md#sysvar_replica_parallel_workers) or
  [`slave_parallel_workers`](replication-options-replica.md#sysvar_slave_parallel_workers) is
  set to a value greater than 0), where
  [`binlog_transaction_dependency_tracking`](replication-options-binary-log.md#sysvar_binlog_transaction_dependency_tracking)
  is set to `WRITESET` or
  `WRITESET_SESSION`,
  `transaction_write_set_extraction` must not
  be `OFF`. While the current value of
  [`binlog_transaction_dependency_tracking`](replication-options-binary-log.md#sysvar_binlog_transaction_dependency_tracking)
  is `WRITESET` or
  `WRITESET_SESSION`, you cannot change the
  value of
  `transaction_write_set_extraction`.

  As of MySQL 8.0.14, setting the session value of this system
  variable is a restricted operation; the session user must
  have privileges sufficient to set restricted session
  variables (see
  [Section 7.1.9.1, “System Variable Privileges”](system-variable-privileges.md "7.1.9.1 System Variable Privileges")).
  [`binlog_format`](replication-options-binary-log.md#sysvar_binlog_format) must be set
  to `ROW` to change the value of
  `transaction_write_set_extraction`. If you
  change the value, the new value does not take effect on
  replicated transactions until after the replica has been
  stopped and restarted with [`STOP
  REPLICA`](stop-replica.md "15.4.2.8 STOP REPLICA Statement") and [`START
  REPLICA`](start-replica.md "15.4.2.6 START REPLICA Statement").
