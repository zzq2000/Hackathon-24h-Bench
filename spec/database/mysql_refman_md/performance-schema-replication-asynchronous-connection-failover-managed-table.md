#### 29.12.11.9 The replication\_asynchronous\_connection\_failover\_managed Table

This table holds configuration information used by the
replica's asynchronous connection failover mechanism to
handle managed groups, including Group Replication topologies.

When you add a group member to the source list and define it
as part of a managed group, the asynchronous connection
failover mechanism updates the source list to keep it in line
with membership changes, adding and removing group members
automatically as they join or leave. When asynchronous
connection failover is enabled for a group of replicas managed
by Group Replication, the source lists are broadcast to all
group members when they join, and also when the lists change.

The asynchronous connection failover mechanism fails over the
connection if another available server on the source list has
a higher priority (weight) setting. For a managed group, a
source’s weight is assigned depending on whether it is a
primary or a secondary server. So assuming that you set up the
managed group to give a higher weight to a primary and a lower
weight to a secondary, when the primary changes, the higher
weight is assigned to the new primary, so the replica changes
over the connection to it. The asynchronous connection
failover mechanism additionally changes connection if the
currently connected managed source server leaves the managed
group, or is no longer in the majority in the managed group.

The
[`replication_asynchronous_connection_failover_managed`](performance-schema-replication-asynchronous-connection-failover-managed-table.md "29.12.11.9 The replication_asynchronous_connection_failover_managed Table")
table has these columns:

- `CHANNEL_NAME`

  The replication channel where the servers for this managed
  group operate.
- `MANAGED_NAME`

  The identifier for the managed group. For the
  `GroupReplication` managed service, the
  identifier is the value of the
  [`group_replication_group_name`](group-replication-system-variables.md#sysvar_group_replication_group_name)
  system variable.
- `MANAGED_TYPE`

  The type of managed service that the asynchronous
  connection failover mechanism provides for this group. The
  only value currently available is
  `GroupReplication`.
- `CONFIGURATION`

  The configuration information for this managed group. For
  the `GroupReplication` managed service,
  the configuration shows the weights assigned to the
  group's primary server and to the group's
  secondary servers. For example:
  `{"Primary_weight": 80, "Secondary_weight":
  60}`

  - `Primary_weight`: Integer between 0
    and 100. Default value is 80.
  - `Secondary_weight`: Integer between 0
    and 100. Default value is 60.
