#### 29.12.13.1 The data\_locks Table

The [`data_locks`](performance-schema-data-locks-table.md "29.12.13.1 The data_locks Table") table shows data
locks held and requested. For information about which lock
requests are blocked by which held locks, see
[Section 29.12.13.2, “The data\_lock\_waits Table”](performance-schema-data-lock-waits-table.md "29.12.13.2 The data_lock_waits Table").

Example data lock information:

Unlike most Performance Schema data collection, there are no
instruments for controlling whether data lock information is
collected or system variables for controlling data lock table
sizes. The Performance Schema collects information that is
already available in the server, so there is no memory or CPU
overhead to generate this information or need for parameters
that control its collection.

Use the [`data_locks`](performance-schema-data-locks-table.md "29.12.13.1 The data_locks Table") table to help
diagnose performance problems that occur during times of heavy
concurrent load. For `InnoDB`, see the
discussion of this topic at
[Section 17.15.2, “InnoDB INFORMATION\_SCHEMA Transaction and Locking Information”](innodb-information-schema-transactions.md "17.15.2 InnoDB INFORMATION_SCHEMA Transaction and Locking Information").

The [`data_locks`](performance-schema-data-locks-table.md "29.12.13.1 The data_locks Table") table has these
columns:

- `ENGINE`

  The storage engine that holds or requested the lock.
- `ENGINE_LOCK_ID`

  The ID of the lock held or requested by the storage
  engine. Tuples of (`ENGINE_LOCK_ID`,
  `ENGINE`) values are unique.

  Lock ID formats are internal and subject to change at any
  time. Applications should not rely on lock IDs having a
  particular format.
- `ENGINE_TRANSACTION_ID`

  The storage engine internal ID of the transaction that
  requested the lock. This can be considered the owner of
  the lock, although the lock might still be pending, not
  actually granted yet
  (`LOCK_STATUS='WAITING'`).

  If the transaction has not yet performed any write
  operation (is still considered read only), the column
  contains internal data that users should not try to
  interpret. Otherwise, the column is the transaction ID.

  For `InnoDB`, to obtain details about the
  transaction, join this column with the
  `TRX_ID` column of the
  `INFORMATION_SCHEMA`
  [`INNODB_TRX`](information-schema-innodb-trx-table.md "28.4.28 The INFORMATION_SCHEMA INNODB_TRX Table") table.
- `THREAD_ID`

  The thread ID of the session that created the lock. To
  obtain details about the thread, join this column with the
  `THREAD_ID` column of the Performance
  Schema [`threads`](performance-schema-threads-table.md "29.12.21.8 The threads Table") table.

  `THREAD_ID` can be used together with
  `EVENT_ID` to determine the event during
  which the lock data structure was created in memory. (This
  event might have occurred before this particular lock
  request occurred, if the data structure is used to store
  multiple locks.)
- `EVENT_ID`

  The Performance Schema event that caused the lock. Tuples
  of (`THREAD_ID`,
  `EVENT_ID`) values implicitly identify a
  parent event in other Performance Schema tables:

  - The parent wait event in the
    `events_waits_xxx`
    tables
  - The parent stage event in the
    `events_stages_xxx`
    tables
  - The parent statement event in the
    `events_statements_xxx`
    tables
  - The parent transaction event in the
    [`events_transactions_current`](performance-schema-events-transactions-current-table.md "29.12.7.1 The events_transactions_current Table")
    table

  To obtain details about the parent event, join the
  `THREAD_ID` and
  `EVENT_ID` columns with the columns of
  like name in the appropriate parent event table. See
  [Section 29.19.2, “Obtaining Parent Event Information”](performance-schema-obtaining-parent-events.md "29.19.2 Obtaining Parent Event Information").
- `OBJECT_SCHEMA`

  The schema that contains the locked table.
- `OBJECT_NAME`

  The name of the locked table.
- `PARTITION_NAME`

  The name of the locked partition, if any;
  `NULL` otherwise.
- `SUBPARTITION_NAME`

  The name of the locked subpartition, if any;
  `NULL` otherwise.
- `INDEX_NAME`

  The name of the locked index, if any;
  `NULL` otherwise.

  In practice, `InnoDB` always creates an
  index (`GEN_CLUST_INDEX`), so
  `INDEX_NAME` is
  non-`NULL` for `InnoDB`
  tables.
- `OBJECT_INSTANCE_BEGIN`

  The address in memory of the lock.
- `LOCK_TYPE`

  The type of lock.

  The value is storage engine dependent. For
  `InnoDB`, permitted values are
  `RECORD` for a row-level lock,
  `TABLE` for a table-level lock.
- `LOCK_MODE`

  How the lock is requested.

  The value is storage engine dependent. For
  `InnoDB`, permitted values are
  `S[,GAP]`, `X[,GAP]`,
  `IS[,GAP]`, `IX[,GAP]`,
  `AUTO_INC`, and
  `UNKNOWN`. Lock modes other than
  `AUTO_INC` and `UNKNOWN`
  indicate gap locks, if present. For information about
  `S`, `X`,
  `IS`, `IX`, and gap
  locks, refer to [Section 17.7.1, “InnoDB Locking”](innodb-locking.md "17.7.1 InnoDB Locking").
- `LOCK_STATUS`

  The status of the lock request.

  The value is storage engine dependent. For
  `InnoDB`, permitted values are
  `GRANTED` (lock is held) and
  `WAITING` (lock is being waited for).
- `LOCK_DATA`

  The data associated with the lock, if any. The value is
  storage engine dependent. For `InnoDB`, a
  value is shown if the `LOCK_TYPE` is
  `RECORD`, otherwise the value is
  `NULL`. Primary key values of the locked
  record are shown for a lock placed on the primary key
  index. Secondary index values of the locked record are
  shown with primary key values appended for a lock placed
  on a secondary index. If there is no primary key,
  `LOCK_DATA` shows either the key values
  of a selected unique index or the unique
  `InnoDB` internal row ID number,
  according to the rules governing `InnoDB`
  clustered index use (see
  [Section 17.6.2.1, “Clustered and Secondary Indexes”](innodb-index-types.md "17.6.2.1 Clustered and Secondary Indexes")).
  `LOCK_DATA` reports “supremum
  pseudo-record” for a lock taken on a supremum
  pseudo-record. If the page containing the locked record is
  not in the buffer pool because it was written to disk
  while the lock was held, `InnoDB` does
  not fetch the page from disk. Instead,
  `LOCK_DATA` reports
  `NULL`.

The [`data_locks`](performance-schema-data-locks-table.md "29.12.13.1 The data_locks Table") table has these
indexes:

- Primary key on (`ENGINE_LOCK_ID`,
  `ENGINE`)
- Index on (`ENGINE_TRANSACTION_ID`,
  `ENGINE`)
- Index on (`THREAD_ID`,
  `EVENT_ID`)
- Index on (`OBJECT_SCHEMA`,
  `OBJECT_NAME`,
  `PARTITION_NAME`,
  `SUBPARTITION_NAME`)

[`TRUNCATE TABLE`](truncate-table.md "15.1.37 TRUNCATE TABLE Statement") is not permitted
for the [`data_locks`](performance-schema-data-locks-table.md "29.12.13.1 The data_locks Table") table.

Note

Prior to MySQL 8.0.1, information similar to that in the
Performance Schema [`data_locks`](performance-schema-data-locks-table.md "29.12.13.1 The data_locks Table")
table is available in the
`INFORMATION_SCHEMA.INNODB_LOCKS` table,
which provides information about each lock that an
`InnoDB` transaction has requested but not
yet acquired, and each lock held by a transaction that is
blocking another transaction.
`INFORMATION_SCHEMA.INNODB_LOCKS` is
deprecated and is removed as of MySQL 8.0.1.
[`data_locks`](performance-schema-data-locks-table.md "29.12.13.1 The data_locks Table") should be used
instead.

Differences between `INNODB_LOCKS` and
[`data_locks`](performance-schema-data-locks-table.md "29.12.13.1 The data_locks Table"):

- If a transaction holds a lock,
  `INNODB_LOCKS` displays the lock only if
  another transaction is waiting for it.
  [`data_locks`](performance-schema-data-locks-table.md "29.12.13.1 The data_locks Table") displays the lock
  regardless of whether any transaction is waiting for it.
- The [`data_locks`](performance-schema-data-locks-table.md "29.12.13.1 The data_locks Table") table has no
  columns corresponding to `LOCK_SPACE`,
  `LOCK_PAGE`, or
  `LOCK_REC`.
- The `INNODB_LOCKS` table requires the
  global [`PROCESS`](privileges-provided.md#priv_process) privilege.
  The [`data_locks`](performance-schema-data-locks-table.md "29.12.13.1 The data_locks Table") table requires
  the usual Performance Schema privilege of
  [`SELECT`](privileges-provided.md#priv_select) on the table to be
  selected from.

The following table shows the mapping from
`INNODB_LOCKS` columns to
[`data_locks`](performance-schema-data-locks-table.md "29.12.13.1 The data_locks Table") columns. Use this
information to migrate applications from one table to the
other.
