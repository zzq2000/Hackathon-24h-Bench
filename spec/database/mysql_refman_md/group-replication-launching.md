#### 20.2.1.4 Launching Group Replication

It is first necessary to ensure that the Group Replication
plugin is installed on server s1. If you used
`plugin_load_add='group_replication.so'` in the
option file then the Group Replication plugin is already
installed, and you can proceed to the next step. Otherwise, you
must install the plugin manually; to do this, connect to the
server using the [**mysql**](mysql.md "6.5.1 mysql — The MySQL Command-Line Client") client, and issue the
SQL statement shown here:

```sql
mysql> INSTALL PLUGIN group_replication SONAME 'group_replication.so';
```

Important

The `mysql.session` user must exist before
you can load Group Replication.
`mysql.session` was added in MySQL version
8.0.2. If your data dictionary was initialized using an
earlier version you must perform the MySQL upgrade procedure
(see [Chapter 3, *Upgrading MySQL*](upgrading.md "Chapter 3 Upgrading MySQL")). If the upgrade is not run,
Group Replication fails to start with the error message
There was an error when trying to access the server
with user: mysql.session@localhost. Make sure the user is
present in the server and that mysql\_upgrade was ran after a
server update.

To check that the plugin was installed successfully, issue
`SHOW PLUGINS;` and check the output. It should
show something like this:

```sql
mysql> SHOW PLUGINS;

+----------------------------+----------+--------------------+----------------------+-------------+

(...)

| group_replication          | ACTIVE   | GROUP REPLICATION  | group_replication.so | PROPRIETARY |
+----------------------------+----------+--------------------+----------------------+-------------+
```
