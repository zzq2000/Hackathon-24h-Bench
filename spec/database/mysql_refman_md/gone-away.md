#### B.3.2.7 MySQL server has gone away

This section also covers the related `Lost connection
to server during query` error.

The most common reason for the `MySQL server has gone
away` error is that the server timed out and closed
the connection. In this case, you normally get one of the
following error codes (which one you get is operating
system-dependent).

| Error Code | Description |
| --- | --- |
| [`CR_SERVER_GONE_ERROR`](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/mysql-errors/8.0/en/client-error-reference.html#error_cr_server_gone_error) | The client couldn't send a question to the server. |
| [`CR_SERVER_LOST`](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/mysql-errors/8.0/en/client-error-reference.html#error_cr_server_lost) | The client didn't get an error when writing to the server, but it didn't get a full answer (or any answer) to the question. |

By default, the server closes the connection after eight hours
if nothing has happened. You can change the time limit by
setting the [`wait_timeout`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_wait_timeout)
variable when you start [**mysqld**](mysqld.md "6.3.1 mysqld — The MySQL Server"). See
[Section 7.1.8, “Server System Variables”](server-system-variables.md "7.1.8 Server System Variables").

If you have a script, you just have to issue the query again
for the client to do an automatic reconnection. This assumes
that you have automatic reconnection in the client enabled
(which is the default for the `mysql`
command-line client).

Some other common reasons for the `MySQL server has
gone away` error are:

- You (or the db administrator) has killed the running
  thread with a [`KILL`](kill.md "15.7.8.4 KILL Statement")
  statement or a [**mysqladmin kill**](mysqladmin.md "6.5.2 mysqladmin — A MySQL Server Administration Program") command.
- You tried to run a query after closing the connection to
  the server. This indicates a logic error in the
  application that should be corrected.
- A client application running on a different host does not
  have the necessary privileges to connect to the MySQL
  server from that host.
- You got a timeout from the TCP/IP connection on the client
  side. This may happen if you have been using the commands:
  [`mysql_options(...,
  MYSQL_OPT_READ_TIMEOUT,...)`](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/c-api/8.0/en/mysql-options.html) or
  [`mysql_options(...,
  MYSQL_OPT_WRITE_TIMEOUT,...)`](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/c-api/8.0/en/mysql-options.html). In this case
  increasing the timeout may help solve the problem.
- You have encountered a timeout on the server side and the
  automatic reconnection in the client is disabled (the
  `reconnect` flag in the
  `MYSQL` structure is equal to 0).
- You are using a Windows client and the server had dropped
  the connection (probably because
  [`wait_timeout`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_wait_timeout) expired)
  before the command was issued.

  The problem on Windows is that in some cases MySQL does
  not get an error from the OS when writing to the TCP/IP
  connection to the server, but instead gets the error when
  trying to read the answer from the connection.

  The solution to this is to either do a
  [`mysql_ping()`](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/c-api/8.0/en/mysql-ping.html) on the
  connection if there has been a long time since the last
  query (this is what Connector/ODBC does) or set
  [`wait_timeout`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_wait_timeout) on the
  [**mysqld**](mysqld.md "6.3.1 mysqld — The MySQL Server") server so high that it in
  practice never times out.
- You can also get these errors if you send a query to the
  server that is incorrect or too large. If
  [**mysqld**](mysqld.md "6.3.1 mysqld — The MySQL Server") receives a packet that is too
  large or out of order, it assumes that something has gone
  wrong with the client and closes the connection. If you
  need big queries (for example, if you are working with big
  [`BLOB`](blob.md "13.3.4 The BLOB and TEXT Types") columns), you can
  increase the query limit by setting the server's
  [`max_allowed_packet`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_max_allowed_packet)
  variable, which has a default value of 64MB. You may also
  need to increase the maximum packet size on the client
  end. More information on setting the packet size is given
  in [Section B.3.2.8, “Packet Too Large”](packet-too-large.md "B.3.2.8 Packet Too Large").

  An [`INSERT`](insert.md "15.2.7 INSERT Statement") or
  [`REPLACE`](replace.md "15.2.12 REPLACE Statement") statement that
  inserts a great many rows can also cause these sorts of
  errors. Either one of these statements sends a single
  request to the server irrespective of the number of rows
  to be inserted; thus, you can often avoid the error by
  reducing the number of rows sent per
  [`INSERT`](insert.md "15.2.7 INSERT Statement") or
  [`REPLACE`](replace.md "15.2.12 REPLACE Statement").
- It is also possible to see this error if host name lookups
  fail (for example, if the DNS server on which your server
  or network relies goes down). This is because MySQL is
  dependent on the host system for name resolution, but has
  no way of knowing whether it is working—from MySQL's
  point of view the problem is indistinguishable from any
  other network timeout.

  You may also see the `MySQL server has gone
  away` error if MySQL is started with the
  [`skip_networking`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_skip_networking) system
  variable enabled.

  Another networking issue that can cause this error occurs
  if the MySQL port (default 3306) is blocked by your
  firewall, thus preventing any connections at all to the
  MySQL server.
- You can also encounter this error with applications that
  fork child processes, all of which try to use the same
  connection to the MySQL server. This can be avoided by
  using a separate connection for each child process.
- You have encountered a bug where the server died while
  executing the query.

You can check whether the MySQL server died and restarted by
executing [**mysqladmin version**](mysqladmin.md "6.5.2 mysqladmin — A MySQL Server Administration Program") and examining
the server's uptime. If the client connection was broken
because [**mysqld**](mysqld.md "6.3.1 mysqld — The MySQL Server") crashed and restarted, you
should concentrate on finding the reason for the crash. Start
by checking whether issuing the query again kills the server
again. See [Section B.3.3.3, “What to Do If MySQL Keeps Crashing”](crashing.md "B.3.3.3 What to Do If MySQL Keeps Crashing").

You can obtain more information about lost connections by
starting [**mysqld**](mysqld.md "6.3.1 mysqld — The MySQL Server") with the
[`log_error_verbosity`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_log_error_verbosity) system
variable set to 3. This logs some of the disconnection
messages in the `hostname.err` file. See
[Section 7.4.2, “The Error Log”](error-log.md "7.4.2 The Error Log").

If you want to create a bug report regarding this problem, be
sure that you include the following information:

- Indicate whether the MySQL server died. You can find
  information about this in the server error log. See
  [Section B.3.3.3, “What to Do If MySQL Keeps Crashing”](crashing.md "B.3.3.3 What to Do If MySQL Keeps Crashing").
- If a specific query kills [**mysqld**](mysqld.md "6.3.1 mysqld — The MySQL Server") and
  the tables involved were checked with
  [`CHECK TABLE`](check-table.md "15.7.3.2 CHECK TABLE Statement") before you ran
  the query, can you provide a reproducible test case? See
  [Section 7.9, “Debugging MySQL”](debugging-mysql.md "7.9 Debugging MySQL").
- What is the value of the
  [`wait_timeout`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_wait_timeout) system
  variable in the MySQL server? ([**mysqladmin
  variables**](mysqladmin.md "6.5.2 mysqladmin — A MySQL Server Administration Program") gives you the value of this variable.)
- Have you tried to run [**mysqld**](mysqld.md "6.3.1 mysqld — The MySQL Server") with the
  general query log enabled to determine whether the problem
  query appears in the log? (See
  [Section 7.4.3, “The General Query Log”](query-log.md "7.4.3 The General Query Log").)
