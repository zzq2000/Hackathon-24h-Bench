#### B.3.4.6 Deleting Rows from Related Tables

If the total length of the
[`DELETE`](delete.md "15.2.2 DELETE Statement") statement for
`related_table` is more than the default
value of the
[`max_allowed_packet`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_max_allowed_packet) system
variable, you should split it into smaller parts and execute
multiple [`DELETE`](delete.md "15.2.2 DELETE Statement") statements. You
probably get the fastest [`DELETE`](delete.md "15.2.2 DELETE Statement")
by specifying only 100 to 1,000
`related_column` values per statement if the
`related_column` is indexed. If the
`related_column` is not indexed, the speed is
independent of the number of arguments in the
`IN` clause.
