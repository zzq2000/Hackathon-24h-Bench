### 10.3.11 Optimizer Use of Generated Column Indexes

MySQL supports indexes on generated columns. For example:

```sql
CREATE TABLE t1 (f1 INT, gc INT AS (f1 + 1) STORED, INDEX (gc));
```

The generated column, `gc`, is defined as the
expression `f1 + 1`. The column is also indexed
and the optimizer can take that index into account during
execution plan construction. In the following query, the
`WHERE` clause refers to `gc`
and the optimizer considers whether the index on that column
yields a more efficient plan:

```sql
SELECT * FROM t1 WHERE gc > 9;
```

The optimizer can use indexes on generated columns to generate
execution plans, even in the absence of direct references in
queries to those columns by name. This occurs if the
`WHERE`, `ORDER BY`, or
`GROUP BY` clause refers to an expression that
matches the definition of some indexed generated column. The
following query does not refer directly to `gc`
but does use an expression that matches the definition of
`gc`:

```sql
SELECT * FROM t1 WHERE f1 + 1 > 9;
```

The optimizer recognizes that the expression `f1 +
1` matches the definition of `gc` and
that `gc` is indexed, so it considers that
index during execution plan construction. You can see this using
[`EXPLAIN`](explain.md "15.8.2 EXPLAIN Statement"):

```sql
mysql> EXPLAIN SELECT * FROM t1 WHERE f1 + 1 > 9\G
*************************** 1. row ***************************
           id: 1
  select_type: SIMPLE
        table: t1
   partitions: NULL
         type: range
possible_keys: gc
          key: gc
      key_len: 5
          ref: NULL
         rows: 1
     filtered: 100.00
        Extra: Using index condition
```

In effect, the optimizer has replaced the expression `f1
+ 1` with the name of the generated column that matches
the expression. That is also apparent in the rewritten query
available in the extended [`EXPLAIN`](explain.md "15.8.2 EXPLAIN Statement")
information displayed by [`SHOW
WARNINGS`](show-warnings.md "15.7.7.42 SHOW WARNINGS Statement"):

```sql
mysql> SHOW WARNINGS\G
*************************** 1. row ***************************
  Level: Note
   Code: 1003
Message: /* select#1 */ select `test`.`t1`.`f1` AS `f1`,`test`.`t1`.`gc`
         AS `gc` from `test`.`t1` where (`test`.`t1`.`gc` > 9)
```

The following restrictions and conditions apply to the
optimizer's use of generated column indexes:

- For a query expression to match a generated column
  definition, the expression must be identical and it must
  have the same result type. For example, if the generated
  column expression is `f1 + 1`, the
  optimizer does not recognize a match if the query uses
  `1 + f1`, or if `f1 + 1`
  (an integer expression) is compared with a string.
- The optimization applies to these operators:
  [`=`](comparison-operators.md#operator_equal),
  [`<`](comparison-operators.md#operator_less-than),
  [`<=`](comparison-operators.md#operator_less-than-or-equal),
  [`>`](comparison-operators.md#operator_greater-than),
  [`>=`](comparison-operators.md#operator_greater-than-or-equal),
  [`BETWEEN`](comparison-operators.md#operator_between), and
  [`IN()`](comparison-operators.md#operator_in).

  For operators other than
  [`BETWEEN`](comparison-operators.md#operator_between) and
  [`IN()`](comparison-operators.md#operator_in), either operand can be
  replaced by a matching generated column. For
  [`BETWEEN`](comparison-operators.md#operator_between) and
  [`IN()`](comparison-operators.md#operator_in), only the first argument
  can be replaced by a matching generated column, and the
  other arguments must have the same result type.
  [`BETWEEN`](comparison-operators.md#operator_between) and
  [`IN()`](comparison-operators.md#operator_in) are not yet supported for
  comparisons involving JSON values.
- The generated column must be defined as an expression that
  contains at least a function call or one of the operators
  mentioned in the preceding item. The expression cannot
  consist of a simple reference to another column. For
  example, `gc INT AS (f1) STORED` consists
  only of a column reference, so indexes on
  `gc` are not considered.
- For comparisons of strings to indexed generated columns that
  compute a value from a JSON function that returns a quoted
  string, [`JSON_UNQUOTE()`](json-modification-functions.md#function_json-unquote) is
  needed in the column definition to remove the extra quotes
  from the function value. (For direct comparison of a string
  to the function result, the JSON comparator handles quote
  removal, but this does not occur for index lookups.) For
  example, instead of writing a column definition like this:

  ```sql
  doc_name TEXT AS (JSON_EXTRACT(jdoc, '$.name')) STORED
  ```

  Write it like this:

  ```sql
  doc_name TEXT AS (JSON_UNQUOTE(JSON_EXTRACT(jdoc, '$.name'))) STORED
  ```

  With the latter definition, the optimizer can detect a match
  for both of these comparisons:

  ```sql
  ... WHERE JSON_EXTRACT(jdoc, '$.name') = 'some_string' ...
  ... WHERE JSON_UNQUOTE(JSON_EXTRACT(jdoc, '$.name')) = 'some_string' ...
  ```

  Without [`JSON_UNQUOTE()`](json-modification-functions.md#function_json-unquote) in the
  column definition, the optimizer detects a match only for
  the first of those comparisons.
- If the optimizer picks the wrong index, an index hint can be
  used to disable it and force the optimizer to make a
  different choice.
