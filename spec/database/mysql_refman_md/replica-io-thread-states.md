### 10.14.5 Replication I/O (Receiver) Thread States

The following list shows the most common states you see in the
`State` column for a replication I/O (receiver)
thread on a replica server. This state also appears in the
`Replica_IO_State` column displayed by
[`SHOW
REPLICA STATUS`](show-replica-status.md "15.7.7.35 SHOW REPLICA STATUS Statement") (or before MySQL 8.0.22,
[`SHOW
REPLICA STATUS`](show-replica-status.md "15.7.7.35 SHOW REPLICA STATUS Statement")), so you can get a good view of what is
happening by using that statement.

In MySQL 8.0.26, incompatible changes were made to
instrumentation names, including the names of thread stages,
containing the terms “master”, which is changed to
“source”, “slave”, which is changed to
“replica”, and “mts” (for
“multithreaded slave”), which is changed to
“mta” (for “multithreaded applier”).
Monitoring tools that work with these instrumentation names
might be impacted. If the incompatible changes have an impact
for you, set the
[`terminology_use_previous`](replication-options-replica.md#sysvar_terminology_use_previous) system
variable to `BEFORE_8_0_26` to make MySQL
Server use the old versions of the names for the objects
specified in the previous list. This enables monitoring tools
that rely on the old names to continue working until they can be
updated to use the new names.

Set the
[`terminology_use_previous`](replication-options-replica.md#sysvar_terminology_use_previous) system
variable with session scope to support individual functions, or
global scope to be a default for all new sessions. When global
scope is used, the slow query log contains the old versions of
the names.

- `Checking master version`

  From MySQL 8.0.26: `Checking source
  version`

  A state that occurs very briefly, after the connection to
  the source is established.
- `Connecting to master`

  From MySQL 8.0.26: `Connecting to source`

  The thread is attempting to connect to the source.
- `Queueing master event to the relay log`

  From MySQL 8.0.26: `Queueing source event to the
  relay log`

  The thread has read an event and is copying it to the relay
  log so that the SQL thread can process it.
- `Reconnecting after a failed binlog dump
  request`

  The thread is trying to reconnect to the source.
- `Reconnecting after a failed master event
  read`

  From MySQL 8.0.26: `Reconnecting after a failed
  source event read`

  The thread is trying to reconnect to the source. When
  connection is established again, the state becomes
  `Waiting for master to send event`.
- `Registering slave on master`

  From MySQL 8.0.26: `Registering replica on
  source`

  A state that occurs very briefly after the connection to the
  source is established.
- `Requesting binlog dump`

  A state that occurs very briefly, after the connection to
  the source is established. The thread sends to the source a
  request for the contents of its binary logs, starting from
  the requested binary log file name and position.
- `Waiting for its turn to commit`

  A state that occurs when the replica thread is waiting for
  older worker threads to commit if
  [`replica_preserve_commit_order`](replication-options-replica.md#sysvar_replica_preserve_commit_order)
  or
  [`slave_preserve_commit_order`](replication-options-replica.md#sysvar_slave_preserve_commit_order)
  is enabled.
- `Waiting for master to send event`

  From MySQL 8.0.26: `Waiting for source to send
  event`

  The thread has connected to the source and is waiting for
  binary log events to arrive. This can last for a long time
  if the source is idle. If the wait lasts for
  [`replica_net_timeout`](replication-options-replica.md#sysvar_replica_net_timeout) or
  [`slave_net_timeout`](replication-options-replica.md#sysvar_slave_net_timeout) seconds,
  a timeout occurs. At that point, the thread considers the
  connection to be broken and makes an attempt to reconnect.
- `Waiting for master update`

  From MySQL 8.0.26: `Waiting for source
  update`

  The initial state before `Connecting to
  master` or `Connecting to source`.
- `Waiting for slave mutex on exit`

  From MySQL 8.0.26: `Waiting for replica mutex on
  exit`

  A state that occurs briefly as the thread is stopping.
- `Waiting for the slave SQL thread to free enough
  relay log space`

  From MySQL 8.0.26: `Waiting for the replica SQL
  thread to free enough relay log space`

  You are using a nonzero
  [`relay_log_space_limit`](replication-options-replica.md#sysvar_relay_log_space_limit)
  value, and the relay logs have grown large enough that their
  combined size exceeds this value. The I/O (receiver) thread
  is waiting until the SQL (applier) thread frees enough space
  by processing relay log contents so that it can delete some
  relay log files.
- `Waiting to reconnect after a failed binlog dump
  request`

  If the binary log dump request failed (due to
  disconnection), the thread goes into this state while it
  sleeps, then tries to reconnect periodically. The interval
  between retries can be specified using the
  [`CHANGE REPLICATION SOURCE TO`](change-replication-source-to.md "15.4.2.3 CHANGE REPLICATION SOURCE TO Statement")
  statement (from MySQL 8.0.23) or [`CHANGE
  MASTER TO`](change-master-to.md "15.4.2.1 CHANGE MASTER TO Statement") statement (before MySQL 8.0.23).
- `Waiting to reconnect after a failed master event
  read`

  From MySQL 8.0.26: `Waiting to reconnect after a
  failed source event read`

  An error occurred while reading (due to disconnection). The
  thread is sleeping for the number of seconds set by the
  [`CHANGE REPLICATION SOURCE TO`](change-replication-source-to.md "15.4.2.3 CHANGE REPLICATION SOURCE TO Statement")
  statement (from MySQL 8.0.23) or [`CHANGE
  MASTER TO`](change-master-to.md "15.4.2.1 CHANGE MASTER TO Statement") statement (before MySQL 8.0.23), which
  defaults to 60, before attempting to reconnect.
