### 28.5.4 The INFORMATION\_SCHEMA TP\_THREAD\_STATE Table

Note

As of MySQL 8.0.14, the thread pool
`INFORMATION_SCHEMA` tables are also available
as Performance Schema tables. (See
[Section 29.12.16, “Performance Schema Thread Pool Tables”](performance-schema-thread-pool-tables.md "29.12.16 Performance Schema Thread Pool Tables").) The
`INFORMATION_SCHEMA` tables are deprecated;
expect them to be removed in a future version of MySQL.
Applications should transition away from the old tables to the
new tables. For example, if an application uses this query:

```sql
SELECT * FROM INFORMATION_SCHEMA.TP_THREAD_STATE;
```

The application should use this query instead:

```sql
SELECT * FROM performance_schema.tp_thread_state;
```

The `TP_THREAD_STATE` table has one row per
thread created by the thread pool to handle connections.

For descriptions of the columns in the
`INFORMATION_SCHEMA`
`TP_THREAD_STATE` table, see
[Section 29.12.16.3, “The tp\_thread\_state Table”](performance-schema-tp-thread-state-table.md "29.12.16.3 The tp_thread_state Table"). The
Performance Schema [`tp_thread_state`](performance-schema-tp-thread-state-table.md "29.12.16.3 The tp_thread_state Table")
table has equivalent columns.
