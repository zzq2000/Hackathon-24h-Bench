#### 19.1.3.5 Using GTIDs for Failover and Scaleout

There are a number of techniques when using MySQL Replication with
Global Transaction Identifiers (GTIDs) for provisioning a new
replica which can then be used for scaleout, being promoted to
source as necessary for failover. This section describes the
following techniques:

- [Simple replication](replication-gtids-failover.md#replication-gtids-failover-replicate "Simple replication")
- [Copying data and transactions to the replica](replication-gtids-failover.md#replication-gtids-failover-copy "Copying data and transactions to the replica")
- [Injecting empty transactions](replication-gtids-failover.md#replication-gtids-failover-empty "Injecting empty transactions")
- [Excluding transactions with gtid\_purged](replication-gtids-failover.md#replication-gtids-failover-gtid-purged "Excluding transactions with gtid_purged")
- [Restoring GTID mode replicas](replication-gtids-failover.md#replication-gtids-restoring-mysqlbinlog "Restoring GTID mode replicas")

Global transaction identifiers were added to MySQL Replication for
the purpose of simplifying in general management of the
replication data flow and of failover activities in particular.
Each identifier uniquely identifies a set of binary log events
that together make up a transaction. GTIDs play a key role in
applying changes to the database: the server automatically skips
any transaction having an identifier which the server recognizes
as one that it has processed before. This behavior is critical for
automatic replication positioning and correct failover.

The mapping between identifiers and sets of events comprising a
given transaction is captured in the binary log. This poses some
challenges when provisioning a new server with data from another
existing server. To reproduce the identifier set on the new
server, it is necessary to copy the identifiers from the old
server to the new one, and to preserve the relationship between
the identifiers and the actual events. This is necessary for
restoring a replica that is immediately available as a candidate
to become a new source on failover or switchover.

**Simple replication.**
The easiest way to reproduce all identifiers and transactions on
a new server is to make the new server into the replica of a
source that has the entire execution history, and enable global
transaction identifiers on both servers. See
[Section 19.1.3.4, “Setting Up Replication Using GTIDs”](replication-gtids-howto.md "19.1.3.4 Setting Up Replication Using GTIDs"), for more information.

Once replication is started, the new server copies the entire
binary log from the source and thus obtains all information about
all GTIDs.

This method is simple and effective, but requires the replica to
read the binary log from the source; it can sometimes take a
comparatively long time for the new replica to catch up with the
source, so this method is not suitable for fast failover or
restoring from backup. This section explains how to avoid fetching
all of the execution history from the source by copying binary log
files to the new server.

**Copying data and transactions to the replica.**
Executing the entire transaction history can be time-consuming
when the source server has processed a large number of
transactions previously, and this can represent a major
bottleneck when setting up a new replica. To eliminate this
requirement, a snapshot of the data set, the binary logs and the
global transaction information the source server contains can be
imported to the new replica. The server where the snapshot is
taken can be either the source or one of its replicas, but you
must ensure that the server has processed all required
transactions before copying the data.

There are several variants of this method, the difference being in
the manner in which data dumps and transactions from binary logs
are transferred to the replica, as outlined here:

Data Set
:   1. Create a dump file using [**mysqldump**](mysqldump.md "6.5.4 mysqldump — A Database Backup Program") on
       the source server. Set the [**mysqldump**](mysqldump.md "6.5.4 mysqldump — A Database Backup Program")
       option [`--master-data`](mysqldump.md#option_mysqldump_master-data)
       (with the default value of 1) to include a
       [`CHANGE REPLICATION SOURCE
       TO`](change-replication-source-to.md "15.4.2.3 CHANGE REPLICATION SOURCE TO Statement") | [`CHANGE MASTER
       TO`](change-master-to.md "15.4.2.1 CHANGE MASTER TO Statement") statement with binary logging information.
       Set the
       [`--set-gtid-purged`](mysqldump.md#option_mysqldump_set-gtid-purged)
       option to `AUTO` (the default) or
       `ON`, to include information about
       executed transactions in the dump. Then use the
       [**mysql**](mysql.md "6.5.1 mysql — The MySQL Command-Line Client") client to import the dump file
       on the target server.
    2. Alternatively, create a data snapshot of the source
       server using raw data files, then copy these files to
       the target server, following the instructions in
       [Section 19.1.2.5, “Choosing a Method for Data Snapshots”](replication-snapshot-method.md "19.1.2.5 Choosing a Method for Data Snapshots"). If you
       use [`InnoDB`](innodb-storage-engine.md "Chapter 17 The InnoDB Storage Engine") tables, you can
       use the **mysqlbackup** command from the
       MySQL Enterprise Backup component to produce a consistent snapshot. This
       command records the log name and offset corresponding to
       the snapshot to be used on the replica. MySQL Enterprise Backup is a
       commercial product that is included as part of a MySQL
       Enterprise subscription. See
       [Section 32.1, “MySQL Enterprise Backup Overview”](mysql-enterprise-backup.md "32.1 MySQL Enterprise Backup Overview") for detailed
       information.
    3. Alternatively, stop both the source and target servers,
       copy the contents of the source's data directory to the
       new replica's data directory, then restart the
       replica. If you use this method, the replica must be
       configured for GTID-based replication, in other words
       with [`gtid_mode=ON`](replication-options-gtids.md#sysvar_gtid_mode). For
       instructions and important information for this method,
       see
       [Section 19.1.2.8, “Adding Replicas to a Replication Environment”](replication-howto-additionalslaves.md "19.1.2.8 Adding Replicas to a Replication Environment").

Transaction History
:   If the source server has a complete transaction history in
    its binary logs (that is, the GTID set
    `@@GLOBAL.gtid_purged` is empty), you can
    use these methods.

    1. Import the binary logs from the source server to the new
       replica using [**mysqlbinlog**](mysqlbinlog.md "6.6.9 mysqlbinlog — Utility for Processing Binary Log Files"), with the
       [`--read-from-remote-server`](mysqlbinlog.md#option_mysqlbinlog_read-from-remote-server),
       [`--read-from-remote-source`](mysqlbinlog.md#option_mysqlbinlog_read-from-remote-source),
       and
       [`--read-from-remote-master`](mysqlbinlog.md#option_mysqlbinlog_read-from-remote-master)
       options.
    2. Alternatively, copy the source server's binary log files
       to the replica. You can make copies from the replica
       using [**mysqlbinlog**](mysqlbinlog.md "6.6.9 mysqlbinlog — Utility for Processing Binary Log Files") with the
       [`--read-from-remote-server`](mysqlbinlog.md#option_mysqlbinlog_read-from-remote-server)
       and [`--raw`](mysqlbinlog.md#option_mysqlbinlog_raw) options.
       These can be read into the replica by using
       [**mysqlbinlog**](mysqlbinlog.md "6.6.9 mysqlbinlog — Utility for Processing Binary Log Files") `>`
       `file`
       (without the [`--raw`](mysqlbinlog.md#option_mysqlbinlog_raw)
       option) to export the binary log files to SQL files,
       then passing these files to the [**mysql**](mysql.md "6.5.1 mysql — The MySQL Command-Line Client")
       client for processing. Ensure that all of the binary log
       files are processed using a single
       [**mysql**](mysql.md "6.5.1 mysql — The MySQL Command-Line Client") process, rather than multiple
       connections. For example:

       ```terminal
       $> mysqlbinlog copied-binlog.000001 copied-binlog.000002 | mysql -u root -p
       ```

       For more information, see
       [Section 6.6.9.3, “Using mysqlbinlog to Back Up Binary Log Files”](mysqlbinlog-backup.md "6.6.9.3 Using mysqlbinlog to Back Up Binary Log Files").

This method has the advantage that a new server is available
almost immediately; only those transactions that were committed
while the snapshot or dump file was being replayed still need to
be obtained from the existing source. This means that the
replica's availability is not instantaneous, but only a
relatively short amount of time should be required for the replica
to catch up with these few remaining transactions.

Copying over binary logs to the target server in advance is
usually faster than reading the entire transaction execution
history from the source in real time. However, it may not always
be feasible to move these files to the target when required, due
to size or other considerations. The two remaining methods for
provisioning a new replica discussed in this section use other
means to transfer information about transactions to the new
replica.

**Injecting empty transactions.**
The source's global
[`gtid_executed`](replication-options-gtids.md#sysvar_gtid_executed) variable contains
the set of all transactions executed on the source. Rather than
copy the binary logs when taking a snapshot to provision a new
server, you can instead note the content of
`gtid_executed` on the server from which the
snapshot was taken. Before adding the new server to the
replication chain, simply commit an empty transaction on the new
server for each transaction identifier contained in the
source's `gtid_executed`, like this:

```sql
SET GTID_NEXT='aaa-bbb-ccc-ddd:N';

BEGIN;
COMMIT;

SET GTID_NEXT='AUTOMATIC';
```

Once all transaction identifiers have been reinstated in this way
using empty transactions, you must flush and purge the
replica's binary logs, as shown here, where
*`N`* is the nonzero suffix of the current
binary log file name:

```sql
FLUSH LOGS;
PURGE BINARY LOGS TO 'source-bin.00000N';
```

You should do this to prevent this server from flooding the
replication stream with false transactions in the event that it is
later promoted to the source. (The [`FLUSH
LOGS`](flush.md#flush-logs) statement forces the creation of a new binary log
file; [`PURGE BINARY LOGS`](purge-binary-logs.md "15.4.1.1 PURGE BINARY LOGS Statement") purges the
empty transactions, but retains their identifiers.)

This method creates a server that is essentially a snapshot, but
in time is able to become a source as its binary log history
converges with that of the replication stream (that is, as it
catches up with the source or sources). This outcome is similar in
effect to that obtained using the remaining provisioning method,
which we discuss in the next few paragraphs.

**Excluding transactions with gtid\_purged.**
The source's global
[`gtid_purged`](replication-options-gtids.md#sysvar_gtid_purged) variable contains
the set of all transactions that have been purged from the
source's binary log. As with the method discussed
previously (see
[Injecting empty transactions](replication-gtids-failover.md#replication-gtids-failover-empty "Injecting empty transactions")), you can
record the value of
[`gtid_executed`](replication-options-gtids.md#sysvar_gtid_executed) on the server
from which the snapshot was taken (in place of copying the
binary logs to the new server). Unlike the previous method,
there is no need to commit empty transactions (or to issue
[`PURGE BINARY LOGS`](purge-binary-logs.md "15.4.1.1 PURGE BINARY LOGS Statement")); instead, you
can set [`gtid_purged`](replication-options-gtids.md#sysvar_gtid_purged) on the
replica directly, based on the value of
[`gtid_executed`](replication-options-gtids.md#sysvar_gtid_executed) on the server
from which the backup or snapshot was taken.

As with the method using empty transactions, this method creates a
server that is functionally a snapshot, but in time is able to
become a source as its binary log history converges with that of
the source and other replicas.

**Restoring GTID mode replicas.**
When restoring a replica in a GTID based replication setup that
has encountered an error, injecting an empty transaction may not
solve the problem because an event does not have a GTID.

Use [**mysqlbinlog**](mysqlbinlog.md "6.6.9 mysqlbinlog — Utility for Processing Binary Log Files") to find the next transaction,
which is probably the first transaction in the next log file after
the event. Copy everything up to the `COMMIT` for
that transaction, being sure to include the `SET
@@SESSION.gtid_next`. Even if you are not using row-based
replication, you can still run binary log row events in the
command line client.

Stop the replica and run the transaction you copied. The
[**mysqlbinlog**](mysqlbinlog.md "6.6.9 mysqlbinlog — Utility for Processing Binary Log Files") output sets the delimiter to
`/*!*/;`, so set it back:

```sql
mysql> DELIMITER ;
```

Restart replication from the correct position automatically:

```sql
mysql> SET GTID_NEXT=automatic;
mysql> RESET SLAVE;
mysql> START SLAVE;
Or from MySQL 8.0.22:
mysql> SET GTID_NEXT=automatic;
mysql> RESET REPLICA;
mysql> START REPLICA;
```
