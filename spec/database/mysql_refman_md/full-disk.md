#### B.3.3.4 How MySQL Handles a Full Disk

This section describes how MySQL responds to disk-full errors
(such as “no space left on device”), and to
quota-exceeded errors (such as “write failed” or
“user block limit reached”).

This section is relevant for writes to
`MyISAM` tables. It also applies for writes
to binary log files and binary log index file, except that
references to “row” and “record”
should be understood to mean “event.”

When a disk-full condition occurs, MySQL does the following:

- It checks once every minute to see whether there is enough
  space to write the current row. If there is enough space,
  it continues as if nothing had happened.
- Every 10 minutes it writes an entry to the log file,
  warning about the disk-full condition.

To alleviate the problem, take the following actions:

- To continue, you only have to free enough disk space to
  insert all records.
- Alternatively, to abort the thread, use
  [**mysqladmin kill**](mysqladmin.md "6.5.2 mysqladmin — A MySQL Server Administration Program"). The thread is aborted
  the next time it checks the disk (in one minute).
- Other threads might be waiting for the table that caused
  the disk-full condition. If you have several
  “locked” threads, killing the one thread that
  is waiting on the disk-full condition enables the other
  threads to continue.

Exceptions to the preceding behavior are when you use
[`REPAIR TABLE`](repair-table.md "15.7.3.5 REPAIR TABLE Statement") or
[`OPTIMIZE TABLE`](optimize-table.md "15.7.3.4 OPTIMIZE TABLE Statement") or when the
indexes are created in a batch after [`LOAD
DATA`](load-data.md "15.2.9 LOAD DATA Statement") or after an [`ALTER
TABLE`](alter-table.md "15.1.9 ALTER TABLE Statement") statement. All of these statements may create
large temporary files that, if left to themselves, would cause
big problems for the rest of the system. If the disk becomes
full while MySQL is doing any of these operations, it removes
the big temporary files and mark the table as crashed. The
exception is that for [`ALTER
TABLE`](alter-table.md "15.1.9 ALTER TABLE Statement"), the old table is left unchanged.
