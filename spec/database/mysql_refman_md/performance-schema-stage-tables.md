### 29.12.5 Performance Schema Stage Event Tables

[29.12.5.1 The events\_stages\_current Table](performance-schema-events-stages-current-table.md)

[29.12.5.2 The events\_stages\_history Table](performance-schema-events-stages-history-table.md)

[29.12.5.3 The events\_stages\_history\_long Table](performance-schema-events-stages-history-long-table.md)

The Performance Schema instruments stages, which are steps
during the statement-execution process, such as parsing a
statement, opening a table, or performing a
`filesort` operation. Stages correspond to the
thread states displayed by [`SHOW
PROCESSLIST`](show-processlist.md "15.7.7.29 SHOW PROCESSLIST Statement") or that are visible in the Information
Schema [`PROCESSLIST`](information-schema-processlist-table.md "28.3.23 The INFORMATION_SCHEMA PROCESSLIST Table") table. Stages
begin and end when state values change.

Within the event hierarchy, wait events nest within stage
events, which nest within statement events, which nest within
transaction events.

These tables store stage events:

- [`events_stages_current`](performance-schema-events-stages-current-table.md "29.12.5.1 The events_stages_current Table"): The
  current stage event for each thread.
- [`events_stages_history`](performance-schema-events-stages-history-table.md "29.12.5.2 The events_stages_history Table"): The most
  recent stage events that have ended per thread.
- [`events_stages_history_long`](performance-schema-events-stages-history-long-table.md "29.12.5.3 The events_stages_history_long Table"): The
  most recent stage events that have ended globally (across
  all threads).

The following sections describe the stage event tables. There
are also summary tables that aggregate information about stage
events; see
[Section 29.12.20.2, “Stage Summary Tables”](performance-schema-stage-summary-tables.md "29.12.20.2 Stage Summary Tables").

For more information about the relationship between the three
stage event tables, see
[Section 29.9, “Performance Schema Tables for Current and Historical Events”](performance-schema-event-tables.md "29.9 Performance Schema Tables for Current and Historical Events").

#### Configuring Stage Event Collection

To control whether to collect stage events, set the state of the
relevant instruments and consumers:

- The [`setup_instruments`](performance-schema-setup-instruments-table.md "29.12.2.3 The setup_instruments Table") table
  contains instruments with names that begin with
  `stage`. Use these instruments to enable or
  disable collection of individual stage event classes.
- The [`setup_consumers`](performance-schema-setup-consumers-table.md "29.12.2.2 The setup_consumers Table") table
  contains consumer values with names corresponding to the
  current and historical stage event table names. Use these
  consumers to filter collection of stage events.

Other than those instruments that provide statement progress
information, the stage instruments are disabled by default. For
example:

```sql
mysql> SELECT NAME, ENABLED, TIMED
       FROM performance_schema.setup_instruments
       WHERE NAME RLIKE 'stage/sql/[a-c]';
+----------------------------------------------------+---------+-------+
| NAME                                               | ENABLED | TIMED |
+----------------------------------------------------+---------+-------+

| stage/sql/Connecting to master                     | NO      | NO    |
| stage/sql/converting HEAP to MyISAM                | NO      | NO    |
| stage/sql/Copying to group table                   | NO      | NO    |
| stage/sql/Copying to tmp table                     | NO      | NO    |
| stage/sql/copy to tmp table                        | NO      | NO    |
| stage/sql/Creating sort index                      | NO      | NO    |
| stage/sql/creating table                           | NO      | NO    |
| stage/sql/Creating tmp table                       | NO      | NO    |
+----------------------------------------------------+---------+-------+
```

Stage event instruments that provide statement progress
information are enabled and timed by default:

```sql
mysql> SELECT NAME, ENABLED, TIMED
       FROM performance_schema.setup_instruments
       WHERE ENABLED='YES' AND NAME LIKE "stage/%";
+------------------------------------------------------+---------+-------+
| NAME                                                 | ENABLED | TIMED |
+------------------------------------------------------+---------+-------+
| stage/sql/copy to tmp table                          | YES     | YES   |
| stage/sql/Applying batch of row changes (write)      | YES     | YES   |
| stage/sql/Applying batch of row changes (update)     | YES     | YES   |
| stage/sql/Applying batch of row changes (delete)     | YES     | YES   |
| stage/innodb/alter table (end)                       | YES     | YES   |
| stage/innodb/alter table (flush)                     | YES     | YES   |
| stage/innodb/alter table (insert)                    | YES     | YES   |
| stage/innodb/alter table (log apply index)           | YES     | YES   |
| stage/innodb/alter table (log apply table)           | YES     | YES   |
| stage/innodb/alter table (merge sort)                | YES     | YES   |
| stage/innodb/alter table (read PK and internal sort) | YES     | YES   |
| stage/innodb/buffer pool load                        | YES     | YES   |
| stage/innodb/clone (file copy)                       | YES     | YES   |
| stage/innodb/clone (redo copy)                       | YES     | YES   |
| stage/innodb/clone (page copy)                       | YES     | YES   |
+------------------------------------------------------+---------+-------+
```

The stage consumers are disabled by default:

```sql
mysql> SELECT *
       FROM performance_schema.setup_consumers
       WHERE NAME LIKE 'events_stages%';
+----------------------------+---------+
| NAME                       | ENABLED |
+----------------------------+---------+
| events_stages_current      | NO      |
| events_stages_history      | NO      |
| events_stages_history_long | NO      |
+----------------------------+---------+
```

To control stage event collection at server startup, use lines
like these in your `my.cnf` file:

- Enable:

  ```ini
  [mysqld]
  performance-schema-instrument='stage/%=ON'
  performance-schema-consumer-events-stages-current=ON
  performance-schema-consumer-events-stages-history=ON
  performance-schema-consumer-events-stages-history-long=ON
  ```
- Disable:

  ```ini
  [mysqld]
  performance-schema-instrument='stage/%=OFF'
  performance-schema-consumer-events-stages-current=OFF
  performance-schema-consumer-events-stages-history=OFF
  performance-schema-consumer-events-stages-history-long=OFF
  ```

To control stage event collection at runtime, update the
[`setup_instruments`](performance-schema-setup-instruments-table.md "29.12.2.3 The setup_instruments Table") and
[`setup_consumers`](performance-schema-setup-consumers-table.md "29.12.2.2 The setup_consumers Table") tables:

- Enable:

  ```sql
  UPDATE performance_schema.setup_instruments
  SET ENABLED = 'YES', TIMED = 'YES'
  WHERE NAME LIKE 'stage/%';

  UPDATE performance_schema.setup_consumers
  SET ENABLED = 'YES'
  WHERE NAME LIKE 'events_stages%';
  ```
- Disable:

  ```sql
  UPDATE performance_schema.setup_instruments
  SET ENABLED = 'NO', TIMED = 'NO'
  WHERE NAME LIKE 'stage/%';

  UPDATE performance_schema.setup_consumers
  SET ENABLED = 'NO'
  WHERE NAME LIKE 'events_stages%';
  ```

To collect only specific stage events, enable only the
corresponding stage instruments. To collect stage events only
for specific stage event tables, enable the stage instruments
but only the stage consumers corresponding to the desired
tables.

For additional information about configuring event collection,
see [Section 29.3, “Performance Schema Startup Configuration”](performance-schema-startup-configuration.md "29.3 Performance Schema Startup Configuration"),
and [Section 29.4, “Performance Schema Runtime Configuration”](performance-schema-runtime-configuration.md "29.4 Performance Schema Runtime Configuration").

#### Stage Event Progress Information

The Performance Schema stage event tables contain two columns
that, taken together, provide a stage progress indicator for
each row:

- `WORK_COMPLETED`: The number of work units
  completed for the stage
- `WORK_ESTIMATED`: The number of work units
  expected for the stage

Each column is `NULL` if no progress
information is provided for an instrument. Interpretation of the
information, if it is available, depends entirely on the
instrument implementation. The Performance Schema tables provide
a container to store progress data, but make no assumptions
about the semantics of the metric itself:

- A “work unit” is an integer metric that
  increases over time during execution, such as the number of
  bytes, rows, files, or tables processed. The definition of
  “work unit” for a particular instrument is left
  to the instrumentation code providing the data.
- The `WORK_COMPLETED` value can increase one
  or many units at a time, depending on the instrumented code.
- The `WORK_ESTIMATED` value can change
  during the stage, depending on the instrumented code.

Instrumentation for a stage event progress indicator can
implement any of the following behaviors:

- No progress instrumentation

  This is the most typical case, where no progress data is
  provided. The `WORK_COMPLETED` and
  `WORK_ESTIMATED` columns are both
  `NULL`.
- Unbounded progress instrumentation

  Only the `WORK_COMPLETED` column is
  meaningful. No data is provided for the
  `WORK_ESTIMATED` column, which displays 0.

  By querying the
  [`events_stages_current`](performance-schema-events-stages-current-table.md "29.12.5.1 The events_stages_current Table") table for
  the monitored session, a monitoring application can report
  how much work has been performed so far, but cannot report
  whether the stage is near completion. Currently, no stages
  are instrumented like this.
- Bounded progress instrumentation

  The `WORK_COMPLETED` and
  `WORK_ESTIMATED` columns are both
  meaningful.

  This type of progress indicator is appropriate for an
  operation with a defined completion criterion, such as the
  table-copy instrument described later. By querying the
  [`events_stages_current`](performance-schema-events-stages-current-table.md "29.12.5.1 The events_stages_current Table") table for
  the monitored session, a monitoring application can report
  how much work has been performed so far, and can report the
  overall completion percentage for the stage, by computing
  the `WORK_COMPLETED` /
  `WORK_ESTIMATED` ratio.

The `stage/sql/copy to tmp table` instrument
illustrates how progress indicators work. During execution of an
[`ALTER TABLE`](alter-table.md "15.1.9 ALTER TABLE Statement") statement, the
`stage/sql/copy to tmp table` stage is used,
and this stage can execute potentially for a long time,
depending on the size of the data to copy.

The table-copy task has a defined termination (all rows copied),
and the `stage/sql/copy to tmp table` stage is
instrumented to provided bounded progress information: The work
unit used is number of rows copied,
`WORK_COMPLETED` and
`WORK_ESTIMATED` are both meaningful, and their
ratio indicates task percentage complete.

To enable the instrument and the relevant consumers, execute
these statements:

```sql
UPDATE performance_schema.setup_instruments
SET ENABLED='YES'
WHERE NAME='stage/sql/copy to tmp table';

UPDATE performance_schema.setup_consumers
SET ENABLED='YES'
WHERE NAME LIKE 'events_stages_%';
```

To see the progress of an ongoing [`ALTER
TABLE`](alter-table.md "15.1.9 ALTER TABLE Statement") statement, select from the
[`events_stages_current`](performance-schema-events-stages-current-table.md "29.12.5.1 The events_stages_current Table") table.
