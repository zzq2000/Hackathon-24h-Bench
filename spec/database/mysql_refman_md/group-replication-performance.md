Group Replication is designed to create fault-tolerant systems with
built-in failure detection and automated recovery. If a member
server instance leaves voluntarily or stops communicating with the
group, the remaining members agree a reconfiguration of the group
between themselves, and choose a new primary if needed. Expelled
members automatically attempt to rejoin the group, and are brought
up to date by distributed recovery. If a group experiences a level
of difficulties such that it cannot contact a majority of its
members in order to agree on a decision, it identifies itself as
having lost quorum and stops processing transactions. Group
Replication also has built-in mechanisms and settings to help the
group adapt to and manage variations in workload and message size,
and stay within the limitations of the underlying system and
networking resources.

The default settings for Group Replication’s system variables are
designed to maximize a group’s performance and autonomy. The
information in this section is to help you configure a replication
group to optimize the automatic handling of any recurring issues
that you experience on your particular systems, such as transient
network outages or workloads and transactions that exceed a server
instance’s resources.

If you find that group members are being expelled and rejoining the
group more frequently than you would like, it is possible that Group
Replication’s default failure detection settings are too sensitive
for your system. This might be the case on slower networks or
machines, networks with a high rate of unexpected transient outages,
or during planned network outages. For advice on dealing with that
situation by adjusting the settings, see
[Section 20.7.7, “Responses to Failure Detection and Network Partitioning”](group-replication-responses-failure.md "20.7.7 Responses to Failure Detection and Network Partitioning").

You should only need to intervene manually in a Group Replication
setup if something happens that the group cannot deal with
automatically. Some key issues that can require administrator
intervention are when a member is in `ERROR` status
and cannot rejoin the group, or when a network partition causes the
group to lose quorum.

- If an otherwise correctly functioning and configured member is
  unable to join or rejoin the group using distributed recovery,
  and remains in `ERROR` status,
  [Section 20.5.4.4, “Fault Tolerance for Distributed Recovery”](group-replication-distributed-recovery-fault.md "20.5.4.4 Fault Tolerance for Distributed Recovery"),
  explains the possible issues. One likely cause is that the
  joining member has extra transactions that are not present on
  the existing members of the group. For advice on dealing with
  that situation, see [Section 20.4.1, “GTIDs and Group Replication”](group-replication-gtids.md "20.4.1 GTIDs and Group Replication").
- If a group has lost quorum, this may be due to a network
  partition that divides the group into two parts, or possibly due
  to the failure of the majority of the servers. For advice on
  dealing with that situation, see
  [Section 20.7.8, “Handling a Network Partition and Loss of Quorum”](group-replication-network-partitioning.md "20.7.8 Handling a Network Partition and Loss of Quorum").
