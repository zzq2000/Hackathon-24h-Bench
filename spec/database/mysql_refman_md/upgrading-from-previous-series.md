## 3.5 Changes in MySQL 8.0

Before upgrading to MySQL 8.0, review the changes
described in this section to identify those that apply to your
current MySQL installation and applications. Perform any
recommended actions.

Changes marked as **Incompatible
change** are incompatibilities with earlier versions of
MySQL, and may require your attention *before
upgrading*. Our aim is to avoid these changes, but
occasionally they are necessary to correct problems that would be
worse than an incompatibility between releases. If an upgrade
issue applicable to your installation involves an incompatibility,
follow the instructions given in the description.

### Data Dictionary Changes

MySQL Server 8.0 incorporates a global data
dictionary containing information about database objects in
transactional tables. In previous MySQL series, dictionary data
was stored in metadata files and nontransactional system tables.
As a result, the upgrade procedure requires that you verify the
upgrade readiness of your installation by checking specific
prerequisites. For more information, see
[Section 3.6, “Preparing Your Installation for Upgrade”](upgrade-prerequisites.md "3.6 Preparing Your Installation for Upgrade"). A data
dictionary-enabled server entails some general operational
differences; see
[Section 16.7, “Data Dictionary Usage Differences”](data-dictionary-usage-differences.md "16.7 Data Dictionary Usage Differences").

### caching\_sha2\_password as the Preferred Authentication Plugin

The `caching_sha2_password` and
`sha256_password` authentication plugins
provide more secure password encryption than the
`mysql_native_password` plugin, and
`caching_sha2_password` provides better
performance than `sha256_password`. Due to
these superior security and performance characteristics of
`caching_sha2_password`, it is as of MySQL 8.0
the preferred authentication plugin, and is also the default
authentication plugin rather than
`mysql_native_password`. This change affects
both the server and the `libmysqlclient` client
library:

- For the server, the default value of the
  [`default_authentication_plugin`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_default_authentication_plugin)
  system variable changes from
  `mysql_native_password` to
  `caching_sha2_password`.

  This change applies only to new accounts created after
  installing or upgrading to MySQL 8.0 or higher. For accounts
  already existing in an upgraded installation, their
  authentication plugin remains unchanged. Existing users who
  wish to switch to `caching_sha2_password`
  can do so using the [`ALTER
  USER`](alter-user.md "15.7.1.1 ALTER USER Statement") statement:

  ```sql
  ALTER USER user
    IDENTIFIED WITH caching_sha2_password
    BY 'password';
  ```
- The `libmysqlclient` library treats
  `caching_sha2_password` as the default
  authentication plugin rather than
  `mysql_native_password`.

The following sections discuss the implications of the more
prominent role of `caching_sha2_password`:

- [caching\_sha2\_password Compatibility Issues and Solutions](upgrading-from-previous-series.md#upgrade-caching-sha2-password-compatibility-issues "caching_sha2_password Compatibility Issues and Solutions")
- [caching\_sha2\_password-Compatible Clients and Connectors](upgrading-from-previous-series.md#upgrade-caching-sha2-password-compatible-connectors "caching_sha2_password-Compatible Clients and Connectors")

- [caching\_sha2\_password and Replication](upgrading-from-previous-series.md#upgrade-caching-sha2-password-replication "caching_sha2_password and Replication")

#### caching\_sha2\_password Compatibility Issues and Solutions

Important

If your MySQL installation must serve pre-8.0 clients and you
encounter compatibility issues after upgrading to MySQL 8.0 or
higher, the simplest way to address those issues and restore
pre-8.0 compatibility is to reconfigure the server to revert
to the previous default authentication plugin
(`mysql_native_password`). For example, use
these lines in the server option file:

```ini
[mysqld]
default_authentication_plugin=mysql_native_password
```

That setting enables pre-8.0 clients to connect to 8.0 servers
until such time as the clients and connectors in use at your
installation are upgraded to know about
`caching_sha2_password`. However, the setting
should be viewed as temporary, not as a long term or permanent
solution, because it causes new accounts created with the
setting in effect to forego the improved authentication
security provided by `caching_sha2_password`.

The use of `caching_sha2_password` offers more
secure password hashing than
`mysql_native_password` (and consequent
improved client connection authentication). However, it also has
compatibility implications that may affect existing MySQL
installations:

- Clients and connectors that have not been updated to know
  about `caching_sha2_password` may have
  trouble connecting to a MySQL 8.0 server configured with
  `caching_sha2_password` as the default
  authentication plugin, even to use accounts that do not
  authenticate with `caching_sha2_password`.
  This issue occurs because the server specifies the name of
  its default authentication plugin to clients. If a client or
  connector is based on a client/server protocol
  implementation that does not gracefully handle an
  unrecognized default authentication plugin, it may fail with
  an error such as one of these:

  ```none
  Authentication plugin 'caching_sha2_password' is not supported
  ```

  ```none
  Authentication plugin 'caching_sha2_password' cannot be loaded:
  dlopen(/usr/local/mysql/lib/plugin/caching_sha2_password.so, 2):
  image not found
  ```

  ```none
  Warning: mysqli_connect(): The server requested authentication
  method unknown to the client [caching_sha2_password]
  ```

  For information about writing connectors to gracefully
  handle requests from the server for unknown default
  authentication plugins, see
  [Authentication Plugin Connector-Writing Considerations](pluggable-authentication.md#pluggable-authentication-connector-writing "Authentication Plugin Connector-Writing Considerations").
- Clients that use an account that authenticates with
  `caching_sha2_password` must use either a
  secure connection (made using TCP using TLS/SSL credentials,
  a Unix socket file, or shared memory), or an unencrypted
  connection that supports password exchange using an RSA key
  pair. This security requirement does not apply to
  `mysql_native_passsword`, so the switch to
  `caching_sha2_password` may require
  additional configuration (see
  [Section 8.4.1.2, “Caching SHA-2 Pluggable Authentication”](caching-sha2-pluggable-authentication.md "8.4.1.2 Caching SHA-2 Pluggable Authentication")).
  However, client connections in MySQL 8.0 prefer use of
  TLS/SSL by default, so clients that already conform to that
  preference may need no additional configuration.
- Clients and connectors that have not been updated to know
  about `caching_sha2_password`
  *cannot* connect to accounts that
  authenticate with `caching_sha2_password`
  because they do not recognize this plugin as valid. (This is
  a particular instance of how client/server authentication
  plugin compatibility requirements apply, as discussed at
  [Authentication Plugin Client/Server Compatibility](pluggable-authentication.md#pluggable-authentication-compatibility "Authentication Plugin Client/Server Compatibility").)
  To work around this issue, relink clients against
  `libmysqlclient` from MySQL 8.0 or higher,
  or obtain an updated connector that recognizes
  `caching_sha2_password`.
- Because `caching_sha2_password` is also now
  the default authentication plugin in the
  `libmysqlclient` client library,
  authentication requires an extra round trip in the
  client/server protocol for connections from MySQL 8.0
  clients to accounts that use
  `mysql_native_password` (the previous
  default authentication plugin), unless the client program is
  invoked with a
  [`--default-auth=mysql_native_password`](connection-options.md#option_general_default-auth)
  option.

The `libmysqlclient` client library for pre-8.0
MySQL versions is able to connect to MySQL 8.0 servers (except
for accounts that authenticate with
`caching_sha2_password`). That means pre-8.0
clients based on `libmysqlclient` should also
be able to connect. Examples:

- Standard MySQL clients such as [**mysql**](mysql.md "6.5.1 mysql — The MySQL Command-Line Client") and
  [**mysqladmin**](mysqladmin.md "6.5.2 mysqladmin — A MySQL Server Administration Program") are
  `libmysqlclient`-based.
- The DBD::mysql driver for Perl DBI is
  `libmysqlclient`-based.
- MySQL Connector/Python has a C Extension module that is
  `libmysqlclient`-based. To use it, include
  the `use_pure=False` option at connect
  time.

When an existing MySQL 8.0 installation is upgraded to MySQL
8.0.4 or higher, some older
`libmysqlclient`-based clients may
“automatically” upgrade if they are dynamically
linked, because they use the new client library installed by the
upgrade. For example, if the DBD::mysql driver for Perl DBI uses
dynamic linking, it can use the
`libmysqlclient` in place after an upgrade to
MySQL 8.0.4 or higher, with this result:

- Prior to the upgrade, DBI scripts that use DBD::mysql can
  connect to a MySQL 8.0 server, except for accounts that
  authenticate with `caching_sha2_password`.
- After the upgrade, the same scripts become able to use
  `caching_sha2_password` accounts as well.

However, the preceding results occur because
`libmysqlclient` instances from MySQL 8.0
installations prior to 8.0.4 are binary compatible: They both
use a shared library major version number of 21. For clients
linked to `libmysqlclient` from MySQL 5.7 or
older, they link to a shared library with a different version
number that is not binary compatible. In this case, the client
must be recompiled against `libmysqlclient`
from 8.0.4 or higher for full compatibility with MySQL 8.0
servers and `caching_sha2_password` accounts.

MySQL Connector/J 5.1 through 8.0.8 is able to connect to MySQL 8.0 servers,
except for accounts that authenticate with
`caching_sha2_password`. (Connector/J 8.0.9 or higher
is required to connect to
`caching_sha2_password` accounts.)

Clients that use an implementation of the client/server protocol
other than `libmysqlclient` may need to be
upgraded to a newer version that understands the new
authentication plugin. For example, in PHP, MySQL connectivity
usually is based on `mysqlnd`, which currently
does not know about `caching_sha2_password`.
Until an updated version of `mysqlnd` is
available, the way to enable PHP clients to connect to MySQL 8.0
is to reconfigure the server to revert to
`mysql_native_password` as the default
authentication plugin, as previously discussed.

If a client or connector supports an option to explicitly
specify a default authentication plugin, use it to name a plugin
other than `caching_sha2_password`. Examples:

- Some MySQL clients support a
  [`--default-auth`](connection-options.md#option_general_default-auth) option.
  (Standard MySQL clients such as [**mysql**](mysql.md "6.5.1 mysql — The MySQL Command-Line Client") and
  [**mysqladmin**](mysqladmin.md "6.5.2 mysqladmin — A MySQL Server Administration Program") support this option but can
  successfully connect to 8.0 servers without it. However,
  other clients may support a similar option. If so, it is
  worth trying it.)
- Programs that use the `libmysqlclient` C
  API can call the
  [`mysql_options()`](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/c-api/8.0/en/mysql-options.html) function
  with the `MYSQL_DEFAULT_AUTH` option.
- MySQL Connector/Python scripts that use the native Python implementation of
  the client/server protocol can specify the
  `auth_plugin` connection option.
  (Alternatively, use the Connector/Python C Extension, which is able to
  connect to MySQL 8.0 servers without the need for
  `auth_plugin`.)

#### caching\_sha2\_password-Compatible Clients and Connectors

If a client or connector is available that has been updated to
know about `caching_sha2_password`, using it is
the best way to ensure compatibility when connecting to a MySQL
8.0 server configured with
`caching_sha2_password` as the default
authentication plugin.

These clients and connectors have been upgraded to support
`caching_sha2_password`:

- The `libmysqlclient` client library in
  MySQL 8.0 (8.0.4 or higher). Standard MySQL clients such as
  [**mysql**](mysql.md "6.5.1 mysql — The MySQL Command-Line Client") and [**mysqladmin**](mysqladmin.md "6.5.2 mysqladmin — A MySQL Server Administration Program")
  are `libmysqlclient`-based, so they are
  compatible as well.
- The `libmysqlclient` client library in
  MySQL 5.7 (5.7.23 or higher). Standard MySQL clients such as
  [**mysql**](mysql.md "6.5.1 mysql — The MySQL Command-Line Client") and [**mysqladmin**](mysqladmin.md "6.5.2 mysqladmin — A MySQL Server Administration Program")
  are `libmysqlclient`-based, so they are
  compatible as well.
- MySQL Connector/C++ 1.1.11 or higher or 8.0.7 or higher.
- MySQL Connector/J 8.0.9 or higher.
- MySQL Connector/NET 8.0.10 or higher (through the classic MySQL
  protocol).
- MySQL Connector/Node.js 8.0.9 or higher.
- PHP: the X DevAPI PHP extension (mysql\_xdevapi) supports
  `caching_sha2_password`.

  PHP: the PDO\_MySQL and ext/mysqli extensions do not support
  `caching_sha2_password`. In addition, when
  used with PHP versions before 7.1.16 and PHP 7.2 before
  7.2.4, they fail to connect with
  `default_authentication_plugin=caching_sha2_password`
  even if `caching_sha2_password` is not
  used.

#### caching\_sha2\_password and the root Administrative Account

For upgrades to MySQL 8.0, the authentication plugin existing
accounts remains unchanged, including the plugin for the
`'root'@'localhost'` administrative account.

For new MySQL 8.0 installations, when you initialize the data
directory (using the instructions at
[Section 2.9.1, “Initializing the Data Directory”](data-directory-initialization.md "2.9.1 Initializing the Data Directory")), the
`'root'@'localhost'` account is created, and
that account uses `caching_sha2_password` by
default. To connect to the server following data directory
initialization, you must therefore use a client or connector
that supports `caching_sha2_password`. If you
can do this but prefer that the `root` account
use `mysql_native_password` after installation,
install MySQL and initialize the data directory as you normally
would. Then connect to the server as `root` and
use [`ALTER USER`](alter-user.md "15.7.1.1 ALTER USER Statement") as follows to
change the account authentication plugin and password:

```sql
ALTER USER 'root'@'localhost'
  IDENTIFIED WITH mysql_native_password
  BY 'password';
```

If the client or connector that you use does not yet support
`caching_sha2_password`, you can use a modified
data directory-initialization procedure that associates the
`root` account with
`mysql_native_password` as soon as the account
is created. To do so, use either of these techniques:

- Supply a
  [`--default-authentication-plugin=mysql_native_password`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_default_authentication_plugin)
  option along with
  [`--initialize`](server-options.md#option_mysqld_initialize) or
  [`--initialize-insecure`](server-options.md#option_mysqld_initialize-insecure).
- Set
  [`default_authentication_plugin`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_default_authentication_plugin)
  to `mysql_native_password` in an option
  file, and name that option file using a
  [`--defaults-file`](server-options.md#option_mysqld_defaults-file) option along
  with [`--initialize`](server-options.md#option_mysqld_initialize) or
  [`--initialize-insecure`](server-options.md#option_mysqld_initialize-insecure). (In
  this case, if you continue to use that option file for
  subsequent server startups, new accounts are created with
  `mysql_native_password` rather than
  `caching_sha2_password` unless you remove
  the
  [`default_authentication_plugin`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_default_authentication_plugin)
  setting from the option file.)

#### caching\_sha2\_password and Replication

In replication scenarios for which all servers have been
upgraded to MySQL 8.0.4 or higher, replica connections to source
servers can use accounts that authenticate with
`caching_sha2_password`. For such connections,
the same requirement applies as for other clients that use
accounts that authenticate with
`caching_sha2_password`: Use a secure
connection or RSA-based password exchange.

To connect to a `caching_sha2_password` account
for source/replica replication:

- Use any of the following [`CHANGE MASTER
  TO`](change-master-to.md "15.4.2.1 CHANGE MASTER TO Statement") options:

  ```sql
  MASTER_SSL = 1
  GET_MASTER_PUBLIC_KEY = 1
  MASTER_PUBLIC_KEY_PATH='path to RSA public key file'
  ```
- Alternatively, you can use the RSA public key-related
  options if the required keys are supplied at server startup.

To connect to a `caching_sha2_password` account
for Group Replication:

- For MySQL built using OpenSSL, set any of the following
  system variables:

  ```sql
  SET GLOBAL group_replication_recovery_use_ssl = ON;
  SET GLOBAL group_replication_recovery_get_public_key = 1;
  SET GLOBAL group_replication_recovery_public_key_path = 'path to RSA public key file';
  ```
- Alternatively, you can use the RSA public key-related
  options if the required keys are supplied at server startup.

### Configuration Changes

- **Incompatible change**: A
  MySQL storage engine is now responsible for providing its
  own partitioning handler, and the MySQL server no longer
  provides generic partitioning support.
  [`InnoDB`](innodb-storage-engine.md "Chapter 17 The InnoDB Storage Engine") and
  `NDB` are the only storage engines that
  provide a native partitioning handler that is supported in
  MySQL 8.0. A partitioned table using any other
  storage engine must be altered—either to convert it to
  `InnoDB` or `NDB`, or to
  remove its partitioning—*before*
  upgrading the server, else it cannot be used afterwards.

  For information about converting `MyISAM`
  tables to `InnoDB`, see
  [Section 17.6.1.5, “Converting Tables from MyISAM to InnoDB”](converting-tables-to-innodb.md "17.6.1.5 Converting Tables from MyISAM to InnoDB").

  A table creation statement that would result in a
  partitioned table using a storage engine without such
  support fails with an error
  (ER\_CHECK\_NOT\_IMPLEMENTED) in MySQL
  8.0. If you import databases from a dump file
  created in MySQL 5.7 (or earlier) using
  [**mysqldump**](mysqldump.md "6.5.4 mysqldump — A Database Backup Program") into a MySQL 8.0
  server, you must make sure that any statements creating
  partitioned tables do not also specify an unsupported
  storage engine, either by removing any references to
  partitioning, or by specifying the storage engine as
  `InnoDB` or allowing it to be set as
  `InnoDB` by default.

  Note

  The procedure given at
  [Section 3.6, “Preparing Your Installation for Upgrade”](upgrade-prerequisites.md "3.6 Preparing Your Installation for Upgrade"), describes how to
  identify partitioned tables that must be altered before
  upgrading to MySQL 8.0.

  See
  [Section 26.6.2, “Partitioning Limitations Relating to Storage Engines”](partitioning-limitations-storage-engines.md "26.6.2 Partitioning Limitations Relating to Storage Engines"),
  for further information.
- **Incompatible change**:
  Several server error codes are not used and have been
  removed (for a list, see
  [Features Removed in MySQL 8.0](mysql-nutshell.md#mysql-nutshell-removals "Features Removed in MySQL 8.0")). Applications
  that test specifically for any of them should be updated.
- **Important change**: The
  default character set has changed from
  `latin1` to `utf8mb4`.
  These system variables are affected:

  - The default value of the
    [`character_set_server`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_character_set_server)
    and
    [`character_set_database`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_character_set_database)
    system variables has changed from
    `latin1` to `utf8mb4`.
  - The default value of the
    [`collation_server`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_collation_server) and
    [`collation_database`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_collation_database)
    system variables has changed from
    `latin1_swedish_ci` to
    `utf8mb4_0900_ai_ci`.

  As a result, the default character set and collation for new
  objects differ from previously unless an explicit character
  set and collation are specified. This includes databases and
  objects within them, such as tables, views, and stored
  programs. Assuming that the previous defaults were used, one
  way to preserve them is to start the server with these lines
  in the `my.cnf` file:

  ```ini
  [mysqld]
  character_set_server=latin1
  collation_server=latin1_swedish_ci
  ```

  In a replicated setting, when upgrading from MySQL 5.7 to
  8.0, it is advisable to change the default character set
  back to the character set used in MySQL 5.7 before
  upgrading. After the upgrade is completed, the default
  character set can be changed to `utf8mb4`.

  In addition, you should be aware that MySQL 8.0 enforces
  checks on permitted characters in a given character set
  which MySQL 5.7 does not; this is a known issue. This means
  that, prior to attempting to upgrade, you should ensure that
  no comments contain characters that are not defined for the
  character set in use. You can fix this in either of two
  ways:

  - Change the character set to one that includes the
    character or characters in question.
  - Remove the offending character or characters.

  The preceding applies to table, file, and index comments.
- **Incompatible change**: As of
  MySQL 8.0.11, it is prohibited to start the server with a
  [`lower_case_table_names`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_lower_case_table_names)
  setting that is different from the setting used when the
  server was initialized. The restriction is necessary because
  collations used by various data dictionary table fields are
  based on the
  [`lower_case_table_names`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_lower_case_table_names)
  setting that was defined when the server was initialized,
  and restarting the server with a different setting would
  introduce inconsistencies with respect to how identifiers
  are ordered and compared.

### Server Changes

- In MySQL 8.0.11, several deprecated features related to
  account management have been removed, such as use of the
  [`GRANT`](grant.md "15.7.1.6 GRANT Statement") statement to modify
  nonprivilege characteristics of user accounts, the
  `NO_AUTO_CREATE_USER` SQL mode, the
  `PASSWORD()` function, and the
  `old_passwords` system variable.

  Replication from MySQL 5.7 to 8.0 of statements that refer
  to these removed features can cause replication failure.
  Applications that use any of the removed features should be
  revised to avoid them and use alternatives when possible, as
  described in [Features Removed in MySQL 8.0](mysql-nutshell.md#mysql-nutshell-removals "Features Removed in MySQL 8.0").

  To avoid a startup failure on MySQL 8.0, remove any instance
  of `NO_AUTO_CREATE_USER` from
  [`sql_mode`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_sql_mode) system variable
  settings in MySQL option files.

  Loading a dump file that includes the
  `NO_AUTO_CREATE_USER` SQL mode in stored
  program definitions into a MySQL 8.0 server causes a
  failure. As of MySQL 5.7.24 and MySQL 8.0.13,
  [**mysqldump**](mysqldump.md "6.5.4 mysqldump — A Database Backup Program") removes
  `NO_AUTO_CREATE_USER` from stored program
  definitions. Dump files created with an earlier version of
  `mysqldump` must be modified manually to
  remove instances of `NO_AUTO_CREATE_USER`.
- In MySQL 8.0.11, these deprecated compatibility SQL modes
  were removed: `DB2`,
  `MAXDB`, `MSSQL`,
  `MYSQL323`, `MYSQL40`,
  `ORACLE`, `POSTGRESQL`,
  `NO_FIELD_OPTIONS`,
  `NO_KEY_OPTIONS`,
  `NO_TABLE_OPTIONS`. They can no longer be
  assigned to the `sql_mode` system variable
  or used as permitted values for the
  [**mysqldump**](mysqldump.md "6.5.4 mysqldump — A Database Backup Program")
  [`--compatible`](mysqldump.md#option_mysqldump_compatible) option.

  Removal of `MAXDB` means that the
  `TIMESTAMP` data type for
  [`CREATE TABLE`](create-table.md "15.1.20 CREATE TABLE Statement") or
  [`ALTER TABLE`](alter-table.md "15.1.9 ALTER TABLE Statement") is no longer
  treated as [`DATETIME`](datetime.md "13.2.2 The DATE, DATETIME, and TIMESTAMP Types").

  Replication from MySQL 5.7 to 8.0 of statements that refer
  to the removed SQL modes can cause replication failure. This
  includes replication of `CREATE` statements
  for stored programs (stored procedures and functions,
  triggers, and events) that are executed while the current
  [`sql_mode`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_sql_mode) value includes any
  of the removed modes. Applications that use any of the
  removed modes should be revised to avoid them.
- The text of many MySQL 8.0 error messages has been revised
  and improved to provide more and better information than in
  MySQL 5.7. If your application depends on specific content
  or formatting of error messages, you should test these and
  be prepared to update the application accordingly prior to
  performing an upgrade.
- As of MySQL 8.0.3, spatial data types permit an
  `SRID` attribute, to explicitly indicate
  the spatial reference system (SRS) for values stored in the
  column. See [Section 13.4.1, “Spatial Data Types”](spatial-type-overview.md "13.4.1 Spatial Data Types").

  A spatial column with an explicit `SRID`
  attribute is SRID-restricted: The column takes only values
  with that ID, and `SPATIAL` indexes on the
  column become subject to use by the optimizer. The optimizer
  ignores `SPATIAL` indexes on spatial
  columns with no `SRID` attribute. See
  [Section 10.3.3, “SPATIAL Index Optimization”](spatial-index-optimization.md "10.3.3 SPATIAL Index Optimization"). If you want
  the optimizer to consider `SPATIAL` indexes
  on spatial columns that are not SRID-restricted, each such
  column should be modified:

  - Verify that all values within the column have the same
    SRID. To determine the SRIDs contained in a geometry
    column *`col_name`*, use the
    following query:

    ```sql
    SELECT DISTINCT ST_SRID(col_name) FROM tbl_name;
    ```

    If the query returns more than one row, the column
    contains a mix of SRIDs. In that case, modify its
    contents so all values have the same SRID.
  - Redefine the column to have an explicit
    `SRID` attribute.
  - Recreate the `SPATIAL` index.
- Several spatial functions were removed in MySQL 8.0.0 due to
  a spatial function namespace change that implemented an
  `ST_` prefix for functions that perform an
  exact operation, or an `MBR` prefix for
  functions that perform an operation based on minimum
  bounding rectangles. The use of removed spatial functions in
  generated column definitions could cause an upgrade failure.
  Before upgrading, run [**mysqlcheck
  --check-upgrade**](mysqlcheck.md "6.5.3 mysqlcheck — A Table Maintenance Program") for removed spatial functions and
  replace any that you find with their `ST_`
  or `MBR` named replacements. For a list of
  removed spatial functions, refer to
  [Features Removed in MySQL 8.0](mysql-nutshell.md#mysql-nutshell-removals "Features Removed in MySQL 8.0").
- The [`BACKUP_ADMIN`](privileges-provided.md#priv_backup-admin) privilege is
  automatically granted to users with the
  [`RELOAD`](privileges-provided.md#priv_reload) privilege when
  performing an in-place upgrade to MySQL 8.0.3 or higher.
- From MySQL 8.0.13, because of differences between row-based
  or mixed replication mode and statement-based replication
  mode in the way that temporary tables are handled, there are
  new restrictions on switching the binary logging format at
  runtime.

  - `SET @@SESSION.binlog_format` cannot
    be used if the session has any open temporary tables.
  - `SET @@global.binlog_format` and
    `SET @@persist.binlog_format` cannot
    be used if any replication channel has any open
    temporary tables. `SET
    @@persist_only.binlog_format` is allowed if
    replication channels have open temporary tables,
    because unlike `PERSIST`,
    `PERSIST_ONLY` does not modify the
    runtime global system variable value.
  - `SET @@global.binlog_format` and
    `SET @@persist.binlog_format` cannot
    be used if any replication channel applier is running.
    This is because the change only takes effect on a
    replication channel when its applier is restarted, at
    which time the replication channel might have open
    temporary tables. This behavior is more restrictive
    than before. `SET
    @@persist_only.binlog_format` is allowed if
    any replication channel applier is running.
  - From MySQL 8.0.27, configuring a session setting for
    [`internal_tmp_mem_storage_engine`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_internal_tmp_mem_storage_engine)
    requires the
    [`SESSION_VARIABLES_ADMIN`](privileges-provided.md#priv_session-variables-admin)
    or
    [`SYSTEM_VARIABLES_ADMIN`](privileges-provided.md#priv_system-variables-admin)
    privilege.
  - As of MySQL 8.0.27, the clone plugin permits
    concurrent DDL operations on the donor MySQL Server
    instance while a cloning operation is in progress.
    Previously, a backup lock was held during the cloning
    operation, preventing concurrent DDL on the donor. To
    revert to the previous behavior of blocking concurrent
    DDL on the donor during a clone operation, enable the
    [`clone_block_ddl`](clone-plugin-options-variables.md#sysvar_clone_block_ddl)
    variable. See
    [Section 7.6.7.4, “Cloning and Concurrent DDL”](clone-plugin-concurrent-ddl.md "7.6.7.4 Cloning and Concurrent DDL").
- From MySQL 8.0.30, error log components listed in the
  [`log_error_services`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_log_error_services) value at
  startup are loaded implicitly early in the MySQL Server
  startup sequence. If you have previously installed loadable
  error log components using [`INSTALL
  COMPONENT`](install-component.md "15.7.4.3 INSTALL COMPONENT Statement") and you list those components in a
  [`log_error_services`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_log_error_services) setting
  that is read at startup (from an option file, for example),
  your configuration should be updated to avoid startup
  warnings. For more information, see
  [Error Log Configuration Methods](error-log-configuration.md#error-log-configuration-methods "Error Log Configuration Methods").

### InnoDB Changes

- [`INFORMATION_SCHEMA`](information-schema.md "Chapter 28 INFORMATION_SCHEMA Tables") views based
  on `InnoDB` system tables were replaced by
  internal system views on data dictionary tables. Affected
  `InnoDB`
  [`INFORMATION_SCHEMA`](information-schema.md "Chapter 28 INFORMATION_SCHEMA Tables") views were
  renamed:

  **Table 3.1 Renamed InnoDB Information Schema Views**

  | Old Name | New Name |
  | --- | --- |
  | `INNODB_SYS_COLUMNS` | `INNODB_COLUMNS` |
  | `INNODB_SYS_DATAFILES` | `INNODB_DATAFILES` |
  | `INNODB_SYS_FIELDS` | `INNODB_FIELDS` |
  | `INNODB_SYS_FOREIGN` | `INNODB_FOREIGN` |
  | `INNODB_SYS_FOREIGN_COLS` | `INNODB_FOREIGN_COLS` |
  | `INNODB_SYS_INDEXES` | `INNODB_INDEXES` |
  | `INNODB_SYS_TABLES` | `INNODB_TABLES` |
  | `INNODB_SYS_TABLESPACES` | `INNODB_TABLESPACES` |
  | `INNODB_SYS_TABLESTATS` | `INNODB_TABLESTATS` |
  | `INNODB_SYS_VIRTUAL` | `INNODB_VIRTUAL` |

  After upgrading to MySQL 8.0.3 or higher, update any scripts
  that reference previous `InnoDB`
  [`INFORMATION_SCHEMA`](information-schema.md "Chapter 28 INFORMATION_SCHEMA Tables") view names.
- The [zlib library](http://www.zlib.net/)
  version bundled with MySQL was raised from version 1.2.3 to
  version 1.2.11.

  The zlib `compressBound()` function in zlib
  1.2.11 returns a slightly higher estimate of the buffer size
  required to compress a given length of bytes than it did in
  zlib version 1.2.3. The `compressBound()`
  function is called by `InnoDB` functions
  that determine the maximum row size permitted when creating
  compressed `InnoDB` tables or inserting and
  updating rows in compressed `InnoDB`
  tables. As a result,
  [`CREATE TABLE
  ... ROW_FORMAT=COMPRESSED`](create-table.md "15.1.20 CREATE TABLE Statement"),
  [`INSERT`](insert.md "15.2.7 INSERT Statement"), and
  [`UPDATE`](update.md "15.2.17 UPDATE Statement") operations with row
  sizes very close to the maximum row size that were
  successful in earlier releases could now fail. To avoid this
  issue, test [`CREATE TABLE`](create-table.md "15.1.20 CREATE TABLE Statement")
  statements for compressed `InnoDB` tables
  with large rows on a MySQL 8.0 test instance prior to
  upgrading.
- With the introduction of the
  [`--innodb-directories`](innodb-parameters.md#sysvar_innodb_directories)
  feature, the location of file-per-table and general
  tablespace files created with an absolute path or in a
  location outside of the data directory should be added to
  the [`innodb_directories`](innodb-parameters.md#sysvar_innodb_directories)
  argument value. Otherwise, `InnoDB` is not
  able to locate these files during recovery. To view
  tablespace file locations, query the Information Schema
  [`FILES`](information-schema-files-table.md "28.3.15 The INFORMATION_SCHEMA FILES Table") table:

  ```sql
  SELECT TABLESPACE_NAME, FILE_NAME FROM INFORMATION_SCHEMA.FILES \G
  ```
- Undo logs can no longer reside in the system tablespace. In
  MySQL 8.0, undo logs reside in two undo
  tablespaces by default. For more information, see
  [Section 17.6.3.4, “Undo Tablespaces”](innodb-undo-tablespaces.md "17.6.3.4 Undo Tablespaces").

  When upgrading from MySQL 5.7 to MySQL
  8.0, any undo tablespaces that exist in the
  MySQL 5.7 instance are removed and replaced by two new
  default undo tablespaces. Default undo tablespaces are
  created in the location defined by the
  [`innodb_undo_directory`](innodb-parameters.md#sysvar_innodb_undo_directory)
  variable. If the
  [`innodb_undo_directory`](innodb-parameters.md#sysvar_innodb_undo_directory)
  variable is undefined, undo tablespaces are created in the
  data directory. Upgrade from MySQL 5.7 to MySQL 8.0 requires
  a slow shutdown which ensures that undo tablespaces in the
  MySQL 5.7 instance are empty, permitting them to be removed
  safely.

  When upgrading to MySQL 8.0.14 or later from an earlier
  MySQL 8.0 release, undo tablespaces that exist in the
  pre-upgrade instance as a result of an
  [`innodb_undo_tablespaces`](innodb-parameters.md#sysvar_innodb_undo_tablespaces)
  setting greater than 2 are treated as user-defined undo
  tablespaces, which can be deactivated and dropped using
  [`ALTER UNDO
  TABLESPACE`](alter-tablespace.md "15.1.10 ALTER TABLESPACE Statement") and
  [`DROP UNDO
  TABLESPACE`](drop-tablespace.md "15.1.33 DROP TABLESPACE Statement") syntax, respectively, after upgrading.
  Upgrade within the MySQL 8.0 release series may not always
  require a slow shutdown which means that existing undo
  tablespaces could contain undo logs. Therefore, existing
  undo tablespaces are not removed by the upgrade process.
- **Incompatible change**: As of
  MySQL 8.0.17, the
  [`CREATE
  TABLESPACE ... ADD DATAFILE`](create-tablespace.md "15.1.21 CREATE TABLESPACE Statement") clause does not permit
  circular directory references. For example, the circular
  directory reference (`/../`) in the
  following statement is not permitted:

  ```sql
  CREATE TABLESPACE ts1 ADD DATAFILE ts1.ibd 'any_directory/../ts1.ibd';
  ```

  An exception to the restriction exists on Linux, where a
  circular directory reference is permitted if the preceding
  directory is a symbolic link. For example, the data file
  path in the example above is permitted if
  *`any_directory`* is a symbolic link.
  (It is still permitted for data file paths to begin with
  '`../`'.)

  To avoid upgrade issues, remove any circular directory
  references from tablespace data file paths before upgrading
  to MySQL 8.0.17 or higher. To inspect tablespace paths,
  query the Information Schema
  [`INNODB_DATAFILES`](information-schema-innodb-datafiles-table.md "28.4.10 The INFORMATION_SCHEMA INNODB_DATAFILES Table") table.
- Due to a regression introduced in MySQL 8.0.14, in-place
  upgrade on a case-sensitive file system from MySQL 5.7 or a
  MySQL 8.0 release prior to MySQL 8.0.14 to MySQL 8.0.16
  failed for instances with partitioned tables and
  [`lower_case_table_names=1`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_lower_case_table_names).
  The failure was caused by a case mismatch issue related to
  partitioned table file names. The fix that introduced the
  regression was reverted, which permits upgrades to MySQL
  8.0.17 from MySQL 5.7 or MySQL 8.0 releases prior to MySQL
  8.0.14 to function as normal. However, the regression is
  still present in the MySQL 8.0.14, 8.0.15, and 8.0.16
  releases.

  In-place upgrade on a case-sensitive file system from MySQL
  8.0.14, 8.0.15, or 8.0.16 to MySQL 8.0.17 fails with the
  following error when starting the server after upgrading
  binaries or packages to MySQL 8.0.17 if partitioned tables
  are present and
  [`lower_case_table_names=1`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_lower_case_table_names):

  ```simple
  Upgrading from server version version_number with
  partitioned tables and lower_case_table_names == 1 on a case sensitive file
  system may cause issues, and is therefore prohibited. To upgrade anyway, restart
  the new server version with the command line option 'upgrade=FORCE'. When
  upgrade is completed, please execute 'RENAME TABLE part_table_name
  TO new_table_name; RENAME TABLE new_table_name
  TO part_table_name;' for each of the partitioned tables.
  Please see the documentation for further information.
  ```

  If you encounter this error when upgrading to MySQL 8.0.17,
  perform the following workaround:

  1. Restart the server with
     [`--upgrade=force`](server-options.md#option_mysqld_upgrade) to force
     the upgrade operation to proceed.
  2. Identify partitioned table file names with lowercase
     partition name delimiters `(#p#` or
     `#sp#`):

     ```sql
     mysql> SELECT FILE_NAME FROM INFORMATION_SCHEMA.FILES WHERE FILE_NAME LIKE '%#p#%' OR FILE_NAME LIKE '%#sp#%';
     ```
  3. For each file identified, rename the associated table
     using a temporary name, then rename the table back to
     its original name.

     ```sql
     mysql> RENAME TABLE table_name TO temporary_table_name;
     mysql> RENAME TABLE temporary_table_name TO table_name;
     ```
  4. Verify that there are no partitioned table file names
     lowercase partition name delimiters (an empty result set
     should be returned).

     ```sql
     mysql> SELECT FILE_NAME FROM INFORMATION_SCHEMA.FILES WHERE FILE_NAME LIKE '%#p#%' OR FILE_NAME LIKE '%#sp#%';
     Empty set (0.00 sec)
     ```
  5. Run [`ANALYZE TABLE`](analyze-table.md "15.7.3.1 ANALYZE TABLE Statement") on each
     renamed table to update the optimizer statistics in the
     `mysql.innodb_index_stats` and
     `mysql.innodb_table_stats` tables.

  Because of the regression still present in the MySQL 8.0.14,
  8.0.15, and 8.0.16 releases, importing partitioned tables
  from MySQL 8.0.14, 8.0.15, or 8.0.16 to MySQL 8.0.17 is not
  supported on case-sensitive file systems where
  [`lower_case_table_names=1`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_lower_case_table_names).
  Attempting to do so results in a “Tablespace is
  missing for table” error.
- MySQL uses delimiter strings when constructing tablespace
  names and file names for table partitions. A “
  `#p#` ” delimiter string precedes
  partition names, and an “ `#sp#`
  ” delimiter string precedes subpartition names, as
  shown:

  ```simple
        schema_name.table_name#p#partition_name#sp#subpartition_name
        table_name#p#partition_name#sp#subpartition_name.ibd
  ```

  Historically, delimiter strings have been uppercase
  (`#P#` and `#SP#`) on
  case-sensitive file systems such as Linux, and lowercase
  (`#p#` and `#sp#`) on
  case-insensitive file systems such as Windows. As of MySQL
  8.0.19, delimiter strings are lowercase on all file systems.
  This change prevents issues when migrating data directories
  between case-sensitive and case-insensitive file systems.
  Uppercase delimiter strings are no longer used.

  Additionally, partition tablespace names and file names
  generated based on user-specified partition or subpartition
  names, which can be specified in uppercase or lowercase, are
  now generated (and stored internally) in lowercase
  regardless of the
  [`lower_case_table_names`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_lower_case_table_names)
  setting to ensure case-insensitivity. For example, if a
  table partition is created with the name
  `PART_1`, the tablespace name and file name
  are generated in lowercase:

  ```simple
        schema_name.table_name#p#part_1
        table_name#p#part_1.ibd
  ```

  During upgrade, MySQL checks and modifies if necessary:

  - Partition file names on disk and in the data dictionary
    to ensure lowercase delimiters and partition names.
  - Partition metadata in the data dictionary for related
    issues introduced by previous bug fixes.
  - `InnoDB` statistics data for related
    issues introduced by previous bug fixes.

  During tablespace import operations, partition tablespace
  file names on disk are checked and modified if necessary to
  ensure lowercase delimiters and partition names.
- As of MySQL 8.0.21, a warning is written to the error log at
  startup or when upgrading from MySQL 5.7 if
  tablespace data files are found to reside in unknown
  directories. Known directories are those defined by the
  [`datadir`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_datadir),
  [`innodb_data_home_dir`](innodb-parameters.md#sysvar_innodb_data_home_dir), and
  [`innodb_directories`](innodb-parameters.md#sysvar_innodb_directories)
  variables. To make a directory known, add it to the
  [`innodb_directories`](innodb-parameters.md#sysvar_innodb_directories) setting.
  Making directories known ensures that data files can be
  found during recovery. For more information, see
  [Tablespace Discovery During Crash Recovery](innodb-recovery.md#innodb-recovery-tablespace-discovery "Tablespace Discovery During Crash Recovery").
- **Important change**: From
  MySQL 8.0.30, the
  [`innodb_redo_log_capacity`](innodb-parameters.md#sysvar_innodb_redo_log_capacity)
  variable controls the amount of disk space occupied by redo
  log files. With this change, the default number of redo log
  files and their location has also changed. From MySQL
  8.0.30, `InnoDB` maintains 32 redo log
  files in the `#innodb_redo` directory in
  the data directory. Previously, `InnoDB`
  created two redo log files in the data directory by default,
  and the number and size of redo log files were controlled by
  the
  [`innodb_log_files_in_group`](innodb-parameters.md#sysvar_innodb_log_files_in_group)
  and [`innodb_log_file_size`](innodb-parameters.md#sysvar_innodb_log_file_size)
  variables. These two variables are now deprecated.

  When the
  [`innodb_redo_log_capacity`](innodb-parameters.md#sysvar_innodb_redo_log_capacity)
  setting is defined,
  [`innodb_log_files_in_group`](innodb-parameters.md#sysvar_innodb_log_files_in_group)
  and [`innodb_log_file_size`](innodb-parameters.md#sysvar_innodb_log_file_size)
  settings are ignored; otherwise, those settings are used to
  compute the `innodb_redo_log_capacity`
  setting (`innodb_log_files_in_group` \*
  `innodb_log_file_size` =
  `innodb_redo_log_capacity`). If none of
  those variables are set, redo log capacity is set to the
  `innodb_redo_log_capacity` default value,
  which is 104857600 bytes (100MB).

  As is generally required for any upgrade, this change
  requires a clean shutdown before upgrading.

  For more information about this feature, see
  [Section 17.6.5, “Redo Log”](innodb-redo-log.md "17.6.5 Redo Log").
- Before MySQL 5.7.35, there was no size limitation for
  indexes in tables with redundant or compact row format. As
  of MySQL 5.7.35, the limit is 767 bytes. An upgrade from a
  MySQL version before 5.7.35 to MySQL 8.0 can produce
  inaccessible tables. If a table with redundant or compact
  row format has an index larger than 767 bytes, drop the
  index and re-create it before an upgrade to MySQL 8.0. The
  error message is:

  ```sql
  mysql> ERROR 1709 (HY000): Index column size too large. The maximum column size is 767 bytes.
  ```

### SQL Changes

- **Incompatible change**: As of
  MySQL 8.0.13, the deprecated `ASC` or
  `DESC` qualifiers for `GROUP
  BY` clauses have been removed. Queries that
  previously relied on `GROUP BY` sorting may
  produce results that differ from previous MySQL versions. To
  produce a given sort order, provide an `ORDER
  BY` clause.

  Queries and stored program definitions from MySQL 8.0.12 or
  lower that use `ASC` or
  `DESC` qualifiers for `GROUP
  BY` clauses should be amended. Otherwise, upgrading
  to MySQL 8.0.13 or higher may fail, as may replicating to
  MySQL 8.0.13 or higher replica servers.
- Some keywords may be reserved in MySQL 8.0 that
  were not reserved in MySQL 5.7. See
  [Section 11.3, “Keywords and Reserved Words”](keywords.md "11.3 Keywords and Reserved Words"). This can cause words previously
  used as identifiers to become illegal. To fix affected
  statements, use identifier quoting. See
  [Section 11.2, “Schema Object Names”](identifiers.md "11.2 Schema Object Names").
- After upgrading, it is recommended that you test optimizer
  hints specified in application code to ensure that the hints
  are still required to achieve the desired optimization
  strategy. Optimizer enhancements can sometimes render
  certain optimizer hints unnecessary. In some cases, an
  unnecessary optimizer hint may even be counterproductive.
- **Incompatible change**: In
  MySQL 5.7, specifying a `FOREIGN KEY`
  definition for an `InnoDB` table without a
  `CONSTRAINT symbol` clause, or specifying the
  `CONSTRAINT` keyword without a
  `symbol`, causes `InnoDB`
  to use a generated constraint name. That behavior changed in
  MySQL 8.0, with `InnoDB` using the
  `FOREIGN KEY index_name` value instead of a generated name. Because
  constraint names must be unique per schema (database), the
  change caused errors due to foreign key index names that
  were not unique per schema. To avoid such errors, the new
  constraint naming behavior has been reverted in MySQL
  8.0.16, and `InnoDB` once again uses a
  generated constraint name.

  For consistency with `InnoDB`,
  `NDB` releases based on MySQL 8.0.16 or
  higher use a generated constraint name if the
  `CONSTRAINT symbol` clause is not specified, or the
  `CONSTRAINT` keyword is specified without a
  `symbol`. `NDB` releases
  based on MySQL 5.7 and earlier MySQL 8.0 releases used the
  `FOREIGN KEY index_name` value.

  The changes described above may introduce incompatibilities
  for applications that depend on the previous foreign key
  constraint naming behavior.
- The handling of system variable values by MySQL flow control
  functions such as [`IFNULL()`](flow-control-functions.md#function_ifnull)
  and [`CASE()`](flow-control-functions.md#operator_case) changed in MySQL
  8.0.22; system variable values are now handled as column
  values of the same character and collation, rather than as
  constants. Some queries using these functions with system
  variables that were previously successful may subsequently
  be rejected with Illegal mix of
  collations. In such cases, cast the system
  variable to the correct character set and collation.
- **Incompatible change**: MySQL
  8.0.28 fixes an issue in previous MySQL 8.0 releases whereby
  the [`CONVERT()`](cast-functions.md#function_convert) function
  sometimes allowed invalid casts of
  [`BINARY`](binary-varbinary.md "13.3.3 The BINARY and VARBINARY Types") values to nonbinary
  character sets. Applications which may have relied on this
  behavior should be checked and if necessary modified prior
  to upgrade.

  In particular, where `CONVERT()` was used
  as part of an expression for an indexed generated column,
  the change in the function's behavior may result in
  index corruption following an upgrade to MySQL 8.0.28. You
  can prevent this from happening by following these steps:

  1. Prior to performing the upgrade, correct any invalid
     input data.
  2. Drop and then re-create the index.

     You can also force a table rebuild using
     [`ALTER TABLE
     table FORCE`](alter-table.md "15.1.9 ALTER TABLE Statement"),
     instead.
  3. Upgrade the MySQL software.

  If you cannot validate the input data beforehand, you should
  not re-create the index or rebuild the table until after you
  perform the upgrade to MySQL 8.0.28.

### Changed Server Defaults

MySQL 8.0 comes with improved defaults, aiming at the best out
of the box experience possible. These changes are driven by the
fact that technology is advancing (machines have more CPUS, use
SSDs and so on), more data is being stored, MySQL is evolving
(InnoDB, Group Replication, AdminAPI), and so on. The
following table summarizes the defaults which have been changed
to provide the best MySQL experience for the majority of users.

For more information about options or variables which have been
added, see [Option and Variable Changes for MySQL 8.0](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/mysqld-version-reference/en/optvar-changes-8-0.html), in the
*MySQL Server Version Reference*.

The following sections explain the changes to defaults and any
impact they might have on your deployment.

**Server Defaults**

- The default value of the
  [`character_set_server`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_character_set_server) system
  variable and command line option
  [`--character-set-server`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_character_set_server)
  changed from `latin1` to
  `utf8mb4`. This is the server’s default
  character set. At this time, UTF8MB4 is the dominant
  character encoding for the web, and this change makes life
  easier for the vast majority of MySQL users. The upgrade
  from 5.7 to 8.0 does not change the character set for any
  existing database objects, but, unless you set
  `character_set_server` explicitly (either
  back to the previous value, or to a new one), a new schema
  uses `utf8mb4` by default. We recommend
  that you move to `utf8mb4` whenever
  possible.
- The default value of the
  [`collation_server`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_collation_server) system
  variable and command line argument
  [`--collation-server`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_collation_server) changed
  from `latin1_swedish_ci`
  to `utf8mb4_0900_ai_ci`. This is the
  server’s default collation, the ordering of characters in
  a character set. There is a link between collations and
  character sets as each character set comes with a list of
  possible collations. The upgrade from 5.7 to 8.0 does not
  change any collation for any existing database objects, but
  takes effect for new objects.
- The default value of the
  [`explicit_defaults_for_timestamp`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_explicit_defaults_for_timestamp)
  system variable changed from `OFF` (MySQL
  legacy behavior) to `ON` (SQL standard
  behavior). This option was originally introduced in 5.6 and
  was `OFF` in 5.6 and 5.7.
- The default value of the
  [`optimizer_trace_max_mem_size`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_optimizer_trace_max_mem_size)
  system variable changed from `16KB` to
  `1MB`. The old default caused the optimizer
  trace to be truncated for any non-trivial query. This change
  ensures useful optimizer traces for most queries.
- The default value of the
  [`validate_password_check_user_name`](validate-password-options-variables.md#sysvar_validate_password_check_user_name)
  system variable changed from `OFF` to
  `ON`. This means that when the
  `validate_password` plugin is enabled, by
  default it now rejects passwords that match the current
  session user name.
- The autosize algorithm for the
  [`back_log`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_back_log) system variable
  has changed.  The value for autosize (-1) is now set to the
  value of [`max_connections`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_max_connections),
  which is bigger than the calculated by `50 +
  (max_connections / 5)`. The
  `back_log` queues up incoming IP connect
  requests in situations where the server is not able to keep
  up with incoming requests. In the worst case, with
  [`max_connections`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_max_connections) number of
  clients trying to reconnect at the same time, for example
  after a network failure, they can all be buffered and
  reject-retry loops are avoided.
- The default value of the
  [`max_allowed_packet`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_max_allowed_packet) system
  variable changed from `4194304` (4M) to
  `67108864` (64M). The main advantage with
  this larger default is less chance of receiving errors about
  an insert or query being larger than
  `max_allowed_packet`. It should be as big
  as the largest [Section 13.3.4, “The BLOB and TEXT Types”](blob.md "13.3.4 The BLOB and TEXT Types") you want to use. To
  revert to the previous behavior, set
  `max_allowed_packet=4194304`.
- The default value of the
  [`max_error_count`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_max_error_count) system
  variable changed from `64` to
  `1024`. This ensures that MySQL handles a
  larger number of warnings, such as an UPDATE statement that
  touches 1000s of rows and many of them give conversion
  warnings. It is common for many tools to batch updates, to
  help reduce replication lag. External tools such as
  pt-online-schema-change defaults to 1000, and gh-ost
  defaults to 100. MySQL 8.0 covers full error history for
  these two use cases. There are no static allocations, so
  this change only affects memory consumption for statements
  that generate lots of warnings.
- The default value of the
  [`event_scheduler`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_event_scheduler) system
  variable changed from `OFF` to
  `ON`. In other words, the event scheduler
  is enabled by default. This is an enabler for new features
  in SYS, for example “kill idle transactions”.
- The default value of the
  [`table_open_cache`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_table_open_cache) system
  variable changed from `2000` to
  `4000`. This is a minor change which
  increases session concurrency on table access.
- The default value of the
  [`log_error_verbosity`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_log_error_verbosity) system
  variable changed from `3` (Notes) to
  `2` (Warning). The purpose is to make the
  MySQL 8.0 error log less verbose by default.

**InnoDB Defaults**

- **Incompatible change** The
  default value of the
  [`innodb_undo_tablespaces`](innodb-parameters.md#sysvar_innodb_undo_tablespaces)
  system variable changed from `0` to
  `2`. The configures the number of undo
  tablespaces used by InnoDB. In MySQL 8.0 the minimum value
  for [`innodb_undo_tablespaces`](innodb-parameters.md#sysvar_innodb_undo_tablespaces)
  is 2 and rollback segments cannot be created in the system
  tablespace anymore. Thus, this is a case where you cannot
  revert back to 5.7 behavior. The purpose of this change is
  to be able to auto-truncate Undo logs (see next item),
  reclaiming disk space used by (occasional) long transactions
  such as a [**mysqldump**](mysqldump.md "6.5.4 mysqldump — A Database Backup Program").
- The default value of the
  [`innodb_undo_log_truncate`](innodb-parameters.md#sysvar_innodb_undo_log_truncate)
  system variable  changed from `OFF` to
  `ON`. When enabled, undo tablespaces that
  exceed the threshold value defined by
  [`innodb_max_undo_log_size`](innodb-parameters.md#sysvar_innodb_max_undo_log_size)
  are marked for truncation. Only undo tablespaces can be
  truncated. Truncating undo logs that reside in the system
  tablespace is not supported. An upgrade from 5.7 to 8.0
  automatically converts your system to use  undo
  tablespaces, using the system tablespace is not an option in
  8.0.
- The default value of the
  [`innodb_flush_method`](innodb-parameters.md#sysvar_innodb_flush_method) system
  variable changed from `NULL` to
  `fsync` on Unix-like systems and from
  `NULL` to `unbuffered` on
  Windows systems. This is more of a terminology and option
  cleanup without any tangible impact. For Unix this is just a
  documentation change as the default was
  `fsync` also in 5.7 (the default
  `NULL` meant `fsync`).
  Similarly on Windows,
  [`innodb_flush_method`](innodb-parameters.md#sysvar_innodb_flush_method) default
  `NULL` meant
  `async_unbuffered` in 5.7, and is replaced
  by default `unbuffered` in 8.0, which in
  combination with the existing default
  [`innodb_use_native_aio=ON`](innodb-parameters.md#sysvar_innodb_use_native_aio)
  has the same effect.
- **Incompatible change** The
  default value of the
  [`innodb_autoinc_lock_mode`](innodb-parameters.md#sysvar_innodb_autoinc_lock_mode)
  system variable changed from `1`
  (consecutive) to `2` (interleaved). The
  change to interleaved lock mode as the default setting
  reflects the change from statement-based to row-based
  replication as the default replication type, which occurred
  in MySQL 5.7. *Statement-based
  replication* requires the consecutive
  auto-increment lock mode to ensure that auto-increment
  values are assigned in a predictable and repeatable order
  for a given sequence of SQL statements, whereas
  *row-based replication* is not sensitive
  to the execution order of SQL statements. Thus, this change
  is known to be incompatible with statement based
  replication, and may break some applications or
  user-generated test suites that depend on sequential auto
  increment. The previous default can be restored by setting
  `innodb_autoinc_lock_mode=1;`
- The default value of the
  [`innodb_flush_neighbors`](innodb-parameters.md#sysvar_innodb_flush_neighbors)
  system variable changes from `1` (enable)
  to `0` (disable). This is done because fast
  IO (SSDs) is now the default for deployment. We expect that
  for the majority of users, this results in a small
  performance gain. Users who are using slower hard drives may
  see a performance loss, and are encouraged to revert to the
  previous defaults by setting
  `innodb_flush_neighbors=1`.
- The default value of the
  [`innodb_max_dirty_pages_pct_lwm`](innodb-parameters.md#sysvar_innodb_max_dirty_pages_pct_lwm)
  system variable changed from `0` (%) to
  `10` (%). With
  `innodb_max_dirty_pages_pct_lwm=10`, InnoDB
  increases its flushing activity when >10% of the buffer
  pool contains modified (‘dirty’) pages. The purpose of
  this change is to trade off peak throughput slightly, in
  exchange for more consistent performance.
- The default value of the
  [`innodb_max_dirty_pages_pct`](innodb-parameters.md#sysvar_innodb_max_dirty_pages_pct)
  system variable changed from `75` (%) to
  `90` (%). This change combines with the
  change to
  [`innodb_max_dirty_pages_pct_lwm`](innodb-parameters.md#sysvar_innodb_max_dirty_pages_pct_lwm)
  and together they ensure a smooth InnoDB flushing behavior,
  avoiding flushing bursts. To revert to the previous
  behavior, set
  `innodb_max_dirty_pages_pct=75` and
  `innodb_max_dirty_pages_pct_lwm=0`.

**Performance Schema Defaults**

- Performance Schema Meta Data Locking  (MDL) instrumentation
  is turned on by default. The compiled default  for
  `performance-schema-instrument='wait/lock/metadata/sql/%=ON'`
  changed from `OFF` to
  `ON`.  This is an enabler for adding MDL
  oriented views in SYS.
- Performance Schema Memory instrumentation is turned on by
  default. The compiled default  for
  `performance-schema-instrument='memory/%=COUNTED'`
  changed from `OFF` to
  `COUNTED`. This is important because the
  accounting is incorrect if instrumentation is enabled after
  server start, and you could get a negative balance from
  missing an allocation, but catching a free.
- Performance Schema Transaction instrumentation is turned on
  by default. The compiled default  for
  `performance-schema-consumer-events-transactions-current=ON`,
  `performance-schema-consumer-events-transactions-history=ON`,
  and
  `performance-schema-instrument='transaction%=ON'`
  changed from `OFF` to
  `ON`.

**Replication Defaults**

- The default value of the
  [`log_bin`](replication-options-binary-log.md#sysvar_log_bin) system variable
  changed from `OFF` to
  `ON`. In other words, binary logging is
  enabled by default. Nearly all production installations
  have the binary log enabled as it is used for replication
  and point-in-time recovery. Thus, by enabling binary log by
  default we eliminate one configuration step, enabling it
  later requires a [**mysqld**](mysqld.md "6.3.1 mysqld — The MySQL Server") restart. Enabling
  it by default also provides better test coverage and it
  becomes easier to spot performance regressions. Remember to
  also set [`server_id`](replication-options.md#sysvar_server_id) (see
  following change). The 8.0 default behavior is as if you
  issued `./mysqld --log-bin --server-id=1`.
  If you are on 8.0 and want 5.7 behavior you can
  issue `./mysqld --skip-log-bin
  --server-id=0`.
- The default value of the
  [`server_id`](replication-options.md#sysvar_server_id) system
  variable changed from `0` to
  `1` (combines with the change to
  [`log_bin=ON`](replication-options-binary-log.md#sysvar_log_bin)). The server can
  be started with this default ID, but in practice you must
  set the [`server-id`](replication-options.md#sysvar_server_id) according
  to the replication infrastructure being deployed, to avoid
  having duplicate server ids.
- The default value of the
  [`log-slave-updates`](replication-options-binary-log.md#sysvar_log_slave_updates) system
  variable changed from `OFF` to
  `ON`.  This causes a replica to log
  replicated events into its own binary log. This option is
  required for Group Replication, and also ensures correct
  behavior in various replication chain setups, which have
  become the norm today.
- The default value of the
  [`expire_logs_days`](replication-options-binary-log.md#sysvar_expire_logs_days) system
  variable changed from `0` to
  `30`. The new default `30`
  causes [**mysqld**](mysqld.md "6.3.1 mysqld — The MySQL Server") to periodically purge
  unused binary logs that are older than 30 days. This change
  helps prevent excessive amounts of disk space being wasted
  on binary logs that are no longer needed for replication or
  recovery purposes. The old value of `0`
  disables any automatic binary log purges.
- The default value of the
  [`master_info_repository`](replication-options-replica.md#sysvar_master_info_repository) and
  [`relay_log_info_repository`](replication-options-replica.md#sysvar_relay_log_info_repository)
  system variables change from `FILE` to
  `TABLE`. Thus in 8.0, replication metadata
  is stored in InnoDB by default. This increases reliability
  to try and achieve crash safe replication by default.
- The default value of the
  [`transaction-write-set-extraction`](replication-options-binary-log.md#sysvar_transaction_write_set_extraction)
  system variable changed from `OFF` to
  `XXHASH64`. This change enables transaction
  write sets by default. By using Transaction Write Sets, the
  source has to do slightly more work to generate the write
  sets, but the result is helpful in conflict detection. This
  is a requirement for Group Replication and the new default
  makes it easy to enable binary log writeset parallelization
  on the source to speed up replication.
- The default value of the
  [`slave_rows_search_algorithms`](replication-options-replica.md#sysvar_slave_rows_search_algorithms)
  system variable changed from
  `INDEX_SCAN,TABLE_SCAN` to
  `INDEX_SCAN,HASH_SCAN`. This change speeds
  up row-based replication by reducing the number of table
  scans the replica applier has to do to apply the changes to
  a table without a primary key.
- The default value of the
  [`slave_pending_jobs_size_max`](replication-options-replica.md#sysvar_slave_pending_jobs_size_max)
  system variable changed from `16M` to
  `128M`. This change increases the amount of
  memory available to multithreaded replicas.
- The default value of the
  [`gtid_executed_compression_period`](replication-options-gtids.md#sysvar_gtid_executed_compression_period)
  system variable changed from `1000` to
  `0`. This change ensures that compression
  of the `mysql.gtid_executed` table only
  occurs implicitly as required.

**Group Replication Defaults**

- The default value of
  [`group_replication_autorejoin_tries`](group-replication-system-variables.md#sysvar_group_replication_autorejoin_tries)
  changed from 0 to 3, which means that automatic rejoin is
  enabled by default. This system variable specifies the
  number of tries that a member makes to automatically rejoin
  the group if it is expelled, or if it is unable to contact a
  majority of the group before the
  [`group_replication_unreachable_majority_timeout`](group-replication-system-variables.md#sysvar_group_replication_unreachable_majority_timeout)
  setting is reached.
- The default value of
  [`group_replication_exit_state_action`](group-replication-system-variables.md#sysvar_group_replication_exit_state_action)
  changed from `ABORT_SERVER` to
  `READ_ONLY`. This means that when a member
  exits the group, for example after a network failure, the
  instance becomes read-only, rather than being shut down.
- The default value of
  [`group_replication_member_expel_timeout`](group-replication-system-variables.md#sysvar_group_replication_member_expel_timeout)
  changed from 0 to 5, meaning that a member suspected of
  having lost contact with the group is liable for expulsion 5
  seconds after the 5-second detection period.

Most of these defaults are reasonably good for both development
and production environments. An exception to this is the
[`--innodb-dedicated-server`](innodb-parameters.md#option_mysqld_innodb-dedicated-server) option,
whose default value remains `OFF`, although we
recommend `ON` for production environments. The
reason for defaulting to `OFF` is that it
causes shared environments such as developer laptops to become
unusable, because it takes *all* the memory
it can find.

For production environments we recommend using
[`--innodb-dedicated-server`](innodb-parameters.md#option_mysqld_innodb-dedicated-server), which
determines values for the following InnoDB variables (if not
specified explicitly), based on available memory:
[`innodb_buffer_pool_size`](innodb-parameters.md#sysvar_innodb_buffer_pool_size),
[`innodb_log_file_size`](innodb-parameters.md#sysvar_innodb_log_file_size), and
[`innodb_flush_method`](innodb-parameters.md#sysvar_innodb_flush_method). See
[Section 17.8.12, “Enabling Automatic InnoDB Configuration for a Dedicated MySQL Server”](innodb-dedicated-server.md "17.8.12 Enabling Automatic InnoDB Configuration for a Dedicated MySQL Server").

Although the new defaults are the best configuration choices for
most use cases, there are special cases, as well as legacy
reasons for using existing 5.7 configuration choices. For
example, some people prefer to upgrade to 8.0 with as few
changes to their applications or operational environment as
possible. We recommend to evaluate all the new defaults and use
as many as you can. Most new defaults can be tested in 5.7, so
you can validate the new defaults in 5.7 production before
upgrading to 8.0. For the few defaults where you need your old
5.7 value, set the corresponding configuration variable or
startup option in your operational environment.

MySQL 8.0 has the Performance Schema
[`variables_info`](performance-schema-variables-info-table.md "29.12.14.2 Performance Schema variables_info Table") table, which shows
for each system variable the source from which it was most
recently set, as well as its range of values. This provides SQL
access to all there is to know about a configuration variable
and its values.

### Valid Performance Regressions

Performance regressions are expected between MySQL versions 5.7
and 8.0. MySQL 8.0 has more features, changes default values, is
more robust, and adds security functionality and additional
diagnostic information. Listed here are valid reasons for
regressions between these versions which includes potential
mediation options. This is not an exhaustive list.

Changes related to default values changing between MySQL
versions 5.7 and 8.0:

- [Binary logs](binary-log.md "7.4.4 The Binary Log") are disabled
  by default in 5.7, and enabled by default in 8.0.

  *Mediation*: Disable binary logging by
  specifying the
  [`--skip-log-bin`](replication-options-binary-log.md#option_mysqld_log-bin)
  or
  [`--disable-log-bin`](replication-options-binary-log.md#option_mysqld_log-bin)
  option at startup.
- The default character set changed from
  `latin1` to `utf8mb4` in
  8.0. While `utf8mb4` performs significantly
  better in 8.0 than it did in 5.7, `latin1`
  is faster than `utf8mb4`.

  *Mediation*: Use
  `latin1` in 8.0 if
  `utf8mb4` is not needed.

[Transactional Data
Dictionary](data-dictionary.md "Chapter 16 MySQL Data Dictionary") (atomic DDL) was introduced in 8.0.

- This increases robustness/reliability at the expense of DDL
  performance (CREATE / DROP intensive loads), but it should
  not impact the DML load (SELECT / INSERT / UPDATE / DELETE).

  *Mediation*: None

The more modern [TLS
ciphers/algorithms](encrypted-connections.md "8.3 Using Encrypted Connections") used as of 5.7.28 has an effect when
TLS (SSL) is enabled (the default):

- Before MySQL 5.7.28, MySQL uses the yaSSL library for the
  community edition and OpenSSL for the enterprise edition.

  As of MySQL 5.7.28, MySQL only uses OpenSSL with its
  stronger TLS ciphers, which are more costly in terms of
  performance.

  Upgrading to MySQL 8.0 from MySQL 5.7.28 or earlier can
  cause a TLS performance regression.

  *Mediation*: None (if TLS is required for
  security reasons)

[Performance Schema
(PFS)](performance-schema.md "Chapter 29 MySQL Performance Schema") instrumentation is much wider in 8.0 than in 5.7:

- PFS cannot be compiled out in MySQL 8.0 but it can be turned
  off. Some performance schema instrumentation will still
  exist even when turned off, but overhead will be smaller.

  *Mediation*: Set performance\_schema = OFF
  in 8.0, or turn off performance schema instrumentation at
  finer granularity if some but not all PFS functionality is
  needed.

Truncating undo tablespaces is enabled by default in 8.0 which
can significantly impact performance:

- Historically InnoDB stored undo logs in the system
  tablespace but there was no way to reclaim space used by
  undo log. The system tablespace would only grow and not
  shrink, and this inspired feature requests to remedy this.

  MySQL 8.0 moved the undo log to separate tablespaces which
  allows both manual and automatic undo log truncation.

  However, auto-truncation has a permanent performance
  overhead and it can potentially cause stalls.

  *Mediation*: Set innodb\_undo\_log\_truncate
  = OFF in 8.0, and manually truncate undo logs as needed. For
  related information, see
  [Truncating Undo Tablespaces](innodb-undo-tablespaces.md#truncate-undo-tablespace "Truncating Undo Tablespaces").

The character classes `[[:alpha:]]` or
`[[:digit:]]` do not perform as well with
regular expression functions such as `REGEXP()`
and `RLIKE()` in MySQL 8.0 as they did in MySQL
5.7. This is due to the replacement in MySQL 8.0 of the Spencer
regular expression library with the ICU library, which uses
UTF-16 internally.

*Mediation*: In place of
`[[:alpha:]]`, use `[a-zA-Z]`;
in place of `[[:digit:]]`, use
`[0-9]`.
