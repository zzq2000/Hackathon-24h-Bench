#### 25.4.3.13 Data Node Memory Management

All memory allocation for a data node is performed when the node
is started. This ensures that the data node can run in a stable
manner without using swap memory, so that
[`NDB`](mysql-cluster.md "Chapter 25 MySQL NDB Cluster 8.0") can be used for
latency-sensitive (realtime) applications. The following types
of memory are allocated on data node startup:

- Data memory
- Shared global memory
- Redo log buffers
- Job buffers
- Send buffers
- Page cache for disk data records
- Schema transaction memory
- Transaction memory
- Undo log buffer
- Query memory
- Block objects
- Schema memory
- Block data structures
- Long signal memory
- Shared memory communication buffers

The [`NDB`](mysql-cluster.md "Chapter 25 MySQL NDB Cluster 8.0") memory manager, which
regulates most data node memory, handles the following memory
resources:

- Data Memory
  ([`DataMemory`](mysql-cluster-ndbd-definition.md#ndbparam-ndbd-datamemory))
- Redo log buffers
  ([`RedoBuffer`](mysql-cluster-ndbd-definition.md#ndbparam-ndbd-redobuffer))
- Job buffers
- Send buffers
  ([`SendBufferMemory`](mysql-cluster-tcp-definition.md#ndbparam-tcp-sendbuffermemory),
  [`TotalSendBufferMemory`](mysql-cluster-ndbd-definition.md#ndbparam-ndbd-totalsendbuffermemory),
  [`ExtraSendBufferMemory`](mysql-cluster-ndbd-definition.md#ndbparam-ndbd-extrasendbuffermemory))
- Disk Data record page cache
  ([`DiskPageBufferMemory`](mysql-cluster-ndbd-definition.md#ndbparam-ndbd-diskpagebuffermemory),
  [`DiskPageBufferEntries`](mysql-cluster-ndbd-definition.md#ndbparam-ndbd-diskpagebufferentries))
- Transaction memory
  ([`TransactionMemory`](mysql-cluster-ndbd-definition.md#ndbparam-ndbd-transactionmemory))
- Query memory
- Disk access records
- File buffers

Each of these resources is set up with a reserved memory area
and a maximum memory area. The reserved memory area can be used
only by the resource for which it is reserved and cannot be
shared with other resources; a given resource can never allocate
more than the maximum memory allowed for the resource. A
resource that has no maximum memory can expand to use all the
shared memory in the memory manager.

The size of the global shared memory for these resources is
controlled by the
[`SharedGlobalMemory`](mysql-cluster-ndbd-definition.md#ndbparam-ndbd-sharedglobalmemory)
configuration parameter (default: 128 MB).

Data memory is always reserved and never acquires any memory
from shared memory. It is controlled using the
[`DataMemory`](mysql-cluster-ndbd-definition.md#ndbparam-ndbd-datamemory) configuration
parameter, whose maximum is 16384 GB.
`DataMemory` is where records are stored,
including hash indexes (approximately 15 bytes per row), ordered
indexes (10-12 bytes per row per index), and row headers (16-32
bytes per row).

Redo log buffers also use reserved memory only; this is
controlled by the
[`RedoBuffer`](mysql-cluster-ndbd-definition.md#ndbparam-ndbd-redobuffer) configuration
parameter, which sets the size of the redo log buffer per LDM
thread. This means that the actual amount of memory used is the
value of this parameter multiplied by the number of LDM threads
in the data node.

Job buffers use reserved memory only; the size of this memory is
calculated by [`NDB`](mysql-cluster.md "Chapter 25 MySQL NDB Cluster 8.0"), based on the
numbers of threads of various types.

Send buffers have a reserved part but can also allocate an
additional 25% of shared global memory. The send buffer reserved
size is calculated in two steps:

1. Use the value of the
   [`TotalSendBufferMemory`](mysql-cluster-ndbd-definition.md#ndbparam-ndbd-totalsendbuffermemory)
   configuration parameter (no default value) or the sum of the
   individual send buffers used by all individual connections
   to the data node. A data node is connected to all other data
   nodes, to all API nodes, and to all management nodes. This
   means that, in a cluster with 2 data nodes, 2 management
   nodes, and 10 API nodes each data node has 13 node
   connections. Since the default value for
   [`SendBufferMemory`](mysql-cluster-tcp-definition.md#ndbparam-tcp-sendbuffermemory) for
   a data node connection is 2 MByte, this works out to 26 MB
   total.
2. To obtain the total reserved size for the send buffer, the
   value of the
   [`ExtraSendBufferMemory`](mysql-cluster-ndbd-definition.md#ndbparam-ndbd-extrasendbuffermemory)
   configuration parameter, if any (default value 0). is added
   to the value obtained in the previous step.

In other words, if `TotalSendBufferMemory` has
been set, the send buffer size is `TotalSendBufferMemory
+ ExtraSendBufferMemory`; otherwise, the size of the
send buffer is equal to `([number of node
connections] * SendBufferMemory) +
ExtraSendBufferMemory`.

The page cache for disk data records uses a reserved resource
only; the size of this resource is controlled by the
[`DiskPageBufferMemory`](mysql-cluster-ndbd-definition.md#ndbparam-ndbd-diskpagebuffermemory)
configuration parameter (default 64 MB). Memory for 32 KB disk
page entries is also allocated; the number of these is
determined by the
[`DiskPageBufferEntries`](mysql-cluster-ndbd-definition.md#ndbparam-ndbd-diskpagebufferentries)
configuration parameter (default 10).

Transaction memory has a reserved part that either is calculated
by `NDB`, or is set explicitly using the
[`TransactionMemory`](mysql-cluster-ndbd-definition.md#ndbparam-ndbd-transactionmemory)
configuration parameter, introduced in NDB 8.0 (previously, this
value was always calculated by
[`NDB`](mysql-cluster.md "Chapter 25 MySQL NDB Cluster 8.0")); transaction memory can also
use an unlimited amount of shared global memory. Transaction
memory is used for all operational resources handling
transactions, scans, locks, scan buffers, and trigger
operations. It also holds table rows as they are updated, before
the next commit writes them to data memory.

Previously, operational records used dedicated resources whose
sizes were controlled by a number of configuration parameters.
In NDB 8.0, these are all allocated from a common transaction
memory resource and can also use resources from global shared
memory. the size of this resource can be controlled using a
single [`TransactionMemory`](mysql-cluster-ndbd-definition.md#ndbparam-ndbd-transactionmemory)
configuration parameter.

Reserved memory for undo log buffers can be set using the
[`InitialLogFileGroup`](mysql-cluster-ndbd-definition.md#ndbparam-ndbd-initiallogfilegroup)
configuration parameter. If an undo log buffer is created as
part of a [`CREATE LOGFILE GROUP`](create-logfile-group.md "15.1.16 CREATE LOGFILE GROUP Statement")
SQL statement, the memory is taken from the transaction memory.

A number of resources relating to metadata for Disk Data
resources also have no reserved part, and use shared global
memory only. Shared global shared memory is thus shared between
send buffers, transaction memory,
and Disk Data metadata.

If [`TransactionMemory`](mysql-cluster-ndbd-definition.md#ndbparam-ndbd-transactionmemory) is
not set, it is calculated based on the following parameters:

- [`MaxNoOfConcurrentOperations`](mysql-cluster-ndbd-definition.md#ndbparam-ndbd-maxnoofconcurrentoperations)
- [`MaxNoOfConcurrentTransactions`](mysql-cluster-ndbd-definition.md#ndbparam-ndbd-maxnoofconcurrenttransactions)
- [`MaxNoOfFiredTriggers`](mysql-cluster-ndbd-definition.md#ndbparam-ndbd-maxnooffiredtriggers)
- [`MaxNoOfLocalOperations`](mysql-cluster-ndbd-definition.md#ndbparam-ndbd-maxnooflocaloperations)
- [`MaxNoOfConcurrentIndexOperations`](mysql-cluster-ndbd-definition.md#ndbparam-ndbd-maxnoofconcurrentindexoperations)
- [`MaxNoOfConcurrentScans`](mysql-cluster-ndbd-definition.md#ndbparam-ndbd-maxnoofconcurrentscans)
- [`MaxNoOfLocalScans`](mysql-cluster-ndbd-definition.md#ndbparam-ndbd-maxnooflocalscans)
- [`BatchSizePerLocalScan`](mysql-cluster-ndbd-definition.md#ndbparam-ndbd-batchsizeperlocalscan)
- [`TransactionBufferMemory`](mysql-cluster-ndbd-definition.md#ndbparam-ndbd-transactionbuffermemory)

When [`TransactionMemory`](mysql-cluster-ndbd-definition.md#ndbparam-ndbd-transactionmemory)
is set explicitly, none of the configuration parameters just
listed are used to calculate memory size. In addition, the
parameters
[`MaxNoOfConcurrentIndexOperations`](mysql-cluster-ndbd-definition.md#ndbparam-ndbd-maxnoofconcurrentindexoperations),
[`MaxNoOfFiredTriggers`](mysql-cluster-ndbd-definition.md#ndbparam-ndbd-maxnooffiredtriggers),
[`MaxNoOfLocalOperations`](mysql-cluster-ndbd-definition.md#ndbparam-ndbd-maxnooflocaloperations),
and [`MaxNoOfLocalScans`](mysql-cluster-ndbd-definition.md#ndbparam-ndbd-maxnooflocalscans)
are incompatible with `TransactionMemory` and
cannot be set concurrently with it; if
`TransactionMemory` is set and any of these
four parameters are also set in the
`config.ini` configuration file, the
management server cannot start. *Note*: Prior
to NDB 8.0.29, this restriction was not enforced for
`MaxNoOfFiredTriggers`,
`MaxNoOfLocalScans`, or
`MaxNoOfLocalOperations` (Bug #102509, Bug
#32474988).

The `MaxNoOfConcurrentIndexOperations`,
`MaxNoOfFiredTriggers`,
`MaxNoOfLocalOperations`, and
`MaxNoOfLocalScans` parameters are all
deprecated in NDB 8.0; you should expect them to be removed from
a future release of MySQL NDB Cluster.

Prior to NDB 8.0.29, it was not possible to set any of
[`MaxNoOfConcurrentTransactions`](mysql-cluster-ndbd-definition.md#ndbparam-ndbd-maxnoofconcurrenttransactions),
[`MaxNoOfConcurrentOperations`](mysql-cluster-ndbd-definition.md#ndbparam-ndbd-maxnoofconcurrentoperations),
or
[`MaxNoOfConcurrentScans`](mysql-cluster-ndbd-definition.md#ndbparam-ndbd-maxnoofconcurrentscans)
concurrently with `TransactionMemory`.

The transaction memory resource contains a large number of
memory pools. Each memory pool represents an object type and
contains a set of objects; each pool includes a reserved part
allocated to the pool at startup; this reserved memory is never
returned to shared global memory. Reserved records are found
using a data structure having only a single level for fast
retrieval, which means that a number of records in each pool
should be reserved. The number of reserved records in each pool
has some impact on performance and reserved memory allocation,
but is generally necessary only in certain very advanced use
cases to set the reserved sizes explicitly.

The size of the reserved part of the pool can be controlled by
setting the following configuration parameters:

- [`ReservedConcurrentIndexOperations`](mysql-cluster-ndbd-definition.md#ndbparam-ndbd-reservedconcurrentindexoperations)
- [`ReservedFiredTriggers`](mysql-cluster-ndbd-definition.md#ndbparam-ndbd-reservedfiredtriggers)
- [`ReservedConcurrentOperations`](mysql-cluster-ndbd-definition.md#ndbparam-ndbd-reservedconcurrentoperations)
- [`ReservedLocalScans`](mysql-cluster-ndbd-definition.md#ndbparam-ndbd-reservedlocalscans)
- [`ReservedConcurrentTransactions`](mysql-cluster-ndbd-definition.md#ndbparam-ndbd-reservedconcurrenttransactions)
- [`ReservedConcurrentScans`](mysql-cluster-ndbd-definition.md#ndbparam-ndbd-reservedconcurrentscans)
- [`ReservedTransactionBufferMemory`](mysql-cluster-ndbd-definition.md#ndbparam-ndbd-reservedtransactionbuffermemory)

For any of the parameters just listed that is not set explicitly
in `config.ini`, the reserved setting is
calculated as 25% of the corresponding maximum setting. For
example, if unset,
`ReservedConcurrentIndexOperations` is
calculated as 25% of
[`MaxNoOfConcurrentIndexOperations`](mysql-cluster-ndbd-definition.md#ndbparam-ndbd-maxnoofconcurrentindexoperations),
and `ReservedLocalScans` is calculated as 25%
of [`MaxNoOfLocalScans`](mysql-cluster-ndbd-definition.md#ndbparam-ndbd-maxnooflocalscans).

Note

If `ReservedTransactionBufferMemory` is not
set, it is calculated as 25% of
[`TransactionBufferMemory`](mysql-cluster-ndbd-definition.md#ndbparam-ndbd-transactionbuffermemory).

The number of reserved records is per data node; these records
are split among the threads handling them (LDM and TC threads)
on each node. In most cases, it is sufficient to set
`TransactionMemory` alone, and to allow the
number of records in pools to be governed by its value.

[`MaxNoOfConcurrentScans`](mysql-cluster-ndbd-definition.md#ndbparam-ndbd-maxnoofconcurrentscans)
limits the number of concurrent scans that can be active in each
TC thread. This is important in guarding against cluster
overload.

[`MaxNoOfConcurrentOperations`](mysql-cluster-ndbd-definition.md#ndbparam-ndbd-maxnoofconcurrentoperations)
limits the number of operations that can be active at any one
time in updating transactions. (Simple reads are not affected by
this parameter.) This number needs to be limited because it is
necessary to preallocate memory for node failure handling, and a
resource must be available for handling the maximum number of
active operations in one TC thread when contending with node
failures. It is imperative that
`MaxNoOfConcurrentOperations` be set to the
same number on all nodes (this can be done most easily by
setting a value for it once, in the `[ndbd
default]` section of the
`config.ini` global configuration file).
While its value can be increased using a rolling restart (see
[Section 25.6.5, “Performing a Rolling Restart of an NDB Cluster”](mysql-cluster-rolling-restart.md "25.6.5 Performing a Rolling Restart of an NDB Cluster")), decreasing it
in this way is not considered safe due to the possibility of a
node failure occurring during the rolling restart.

It is possible to limit the size of a single transaction in NDB
Cluster through the
`MaxDMLOperationsPerTransaction`
parameter. If this is not set, the size of one transaction is
limited by `MaxNoOfConcurrentOperations` since
this parameter limits the total number of concurrent operations
per TC thread.

Schema memory size is controlled by the following set of
configuration parameters:

- [`MaxNoOfSubscriptions`](mysql-cluster-ndbd-definition.md#ndbparam-ndbd-maxnoofsubscriptions)
- [`MaxNoOfSubscribers`](mysql-cluster-ndbd-definition.md#ndbparam-ndbd-maxnoofsubscribers)
- [`MaxNoOfConcurrentSubOperations`](mysql-cluster-ndbd-definition.md#ndbparam-ndbd-maxnoofconcurrentsuboperations)
- [`MaxNoOfAttributes`](mysql-cluster-ndbd-definition.md#ndbparam-ndbd-maxnoofattributes)
- [`MaxNoOfTables`](mysql-cluster-ndbd-definition.md#ndbparam-ndbd-maxnooftables)
- [`MaxNoOfOrderedIndexes`](mysql-cluster-ndbd-definition.md#ndbparam-ndbd-maxnooforderedindexes)
- [`MaxNoOfUniqueHashIndexes`](mysql-cluster-ndbd-definition.md#ndbparam-ndbd-maxnoofuniquehashindexes)
- [`MaxNoOfTriggers`](mysql-cluster-ndbd-definition.md#ndbparam-ndbd-maxnooftriggers)

The number of nodes and the number of LDM threads also have a
major impact on the size of schema memory since the number of
partitions in each table and each partition (and its fragment
replicas) have to be represented in schema memory.

In addition, a number of other records are allocated during
startup. These are relatively small. Each block in each thread
contains block objects that use memory. This memory size is also
normally quite small compared to the other data node memory
structures.
