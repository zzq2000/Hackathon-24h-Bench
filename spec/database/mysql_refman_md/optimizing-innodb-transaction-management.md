### 10.5.2 Optimizing InnoDB Transaction Management

To optimize `InnoDB` transaction processing,
find the ideal balance between the performance overhead of
transactional features and the workload of your server. For
example, an application might encounter performance issues if it
commits thousands of times per second, and different performance
issues if it commits only every 2-3 hours.

- The default MySQL setting `AUTOCOMMIT=1`
  can impose performance limitations on a busy database
  server. Where practical, wrap several related data change
  operations into a single transaction, by issuing
  `SET AUTOCOMMIT=0` or a `START
  TRANSACTION` statement, followed by a
  `COMMIT` statement after making all the
  changes.

  `InnoDB` must flush the log to disk at each
  transaction commit if that transaction made modifications to
  the database. When each change is followed by a commit (as
  with the default autocommit setting), the I/O throughput of
  the storage device puts a cap on the number of potential
  operations per second.
- Alternatively, for transactions that consist only of a
  single [`SELECT`](select.md "15.2.13 SELECT Statement") statement,
  turning on `AUTOCOMMIT` helps
  `InnoDB` to recognize read-only
  transactions and optimize them. See
  [Section 10.5.3, “Optimizing InnoDB Read-Only Transactions”](innodb-performance-ro-txn.md "10.5.3 Optimizing InnoDB Read-Only Transactions") for
  requirements.
- Avoid performing rollbacks after inserting, updating, or
  deleting huge numbers of rows. If a big transaction is
  slowing down server performance, rolling it back can make
  the problem worse, potentially taking several times as long
  to perform as the original data change operations. Killing
  the database process does not help, because the rollback
  starts again on server startup.

  To minimize the chance of this issue occurring:

  - Increase the size of the
    [buffer pool](glossary.md#glos_buffer_pool "buffer pool") so
    that all the data change changes can be cached rather
    than immediately written to disk.
  - Set
    [`innodb_change_buffering=all`](innodb-parameters.md#sysvar_innodb_change_buffering)
    so that update and delete operations are buffered in
    addition to inserts.
  - Consider issuing `COMMIT` statements
    periodically during the big data change operation,
    possibly breaking a single delete or update into
    multiple statements that operate on smaller numbers of
    rows.

  To get rid of a runaway rollback once it occurs, increase
  the buffer pool so that the rollback becomes CPU-bound and
  runs fast, or kill the server and restart with
  [`innodb_force_recovery=3`](innodb-parameters.md#sysvar_innodb_force_recovery), as
  explained in [Section 17.18.2, “InnoDB Recovery”](innodb-recovery.md "17.18.2 InnoDB Recovery").

  This issue is expected to be infrequent with the default
  setting
  [`innodb_change_buffering=all`](innodb-parameters.md#sysvar_innodb_change_buffering),
  which allows update and delete operations to be cached in
  memory, making them faster to perform in the first place,
  and also faster to roll back if needed. Make sure to use
  this parameter setting on servers that process long-running
  transactions with many inserts, updates, or deletes.
- If you can afford the loss of some of the latest committed
  transactions if an unexpected exit occurs, you can set the
  [`innodb_flush_log_at_trx_commit`](innodb-parameters.md#sysvar_innodb_flush_log_at_trx_commit)
  parameter to 0. `InnoDB` tries to flush the
  log once per second anyway, although the flush is not
  guaranteed.
- When rows are modified or deleted, the rows and associated
  [undo logs](glossary.md#glos_undo_log "undo log") are not
  physically removed immediately, or even immediately after
  the transaction commits. The old data is preserved until
  transactions that started earlier or concurrently are
  finished, so that those transactions can access the previous
  state of modified or deleted rows. Thus, a long-running
  transaction can prevent `InnoDB` from
  purging data that was changed by a different transaction.
- When rows are modified or deleted within a long-running
  transaction, other transactions using the
  [`READ COMMITTED`](innodb-transaction-isolation-levels.md#isolevel_read-committed) and
  [`REPEATABLE READ`](innodb-transaction-isolation-levels.md#isolevel_repeatable-read) isolation
  levels have to do more work to reconstruct the older data if
  they read those same rows.
- When a long-running transaction modifies a table, queries
  against that table from other transactions do not make use
  of the [covering
  index](glossary.md#glos_covering_index "covering index") technique. Queries that normally could retrieve
  all the result columns from a secondary index, instead look
  up the appropriate values from the table data.

  If secondary index pages are found to have a
  `PAGE_MAX_TRX_ID` that is too new, or if
  records in the secondary index are delete-marked,
  `InnoDB` may need to look up records using
  a clustered index.
