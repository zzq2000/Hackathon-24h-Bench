#### 15.4.1.3 SET sql\_log\_bin Statement

```sql
SET sql_log_bin = {OFF|ON}
```

The [`sql_log_bin`](replication-options-binary-log.md#sysvar_sql_log_bin) variable
controls whether logging to the binary log is enabled for the
current session (assuming that the binary log itself is
enabled). The default value is `ON`. To disable
or enable binary logging for the current session, set the
session [`sql_log_bin`](replication-options-binary-log.md#sysvar_sql_log_bin) variable to
`OFF` or `ON`.

Set this variable to `OFF` for a session to
temporarily disable binary logging while making changes to the
source that you do not want replicated to the replica.

Setting the session value of this system variable is a
restricted operation. The session user must have privileges
sufficient to set restricted session variables. See
[Section 7.1.9.1, “System Variable Privileges”](system-variable-privileges.md "7.1.9.1 System Variable Privileges").

It is not possible to set the session value of
[`sql_log_bin`](replication-options-binary-log.md#sysvar_sql_log_bin) within a
transaction or subquery.

*Setting this variable to `OFF`
prevents new GTIDs from being assigned to transactions in the
binary log*. If you are using GTIDs for replication,
this means that even when binary logging is later enabled again,
the GTIDs written into the log from this point do not account
for any transactions that occurred in the meantime, so in effect
those transactions are lost.

[**mysqldump**](mysqldump.md "6.5.4 mysqldump — A Database Backup Program") adds a `SET
@@SESSION.sql_log_bin=0` statement to a dump file from
a server where GTIDs are in use, which disables binary logging
while the dump file is being reloaded. The statement prevents
new GTIDs from being generated and assigned to the transactions
in the dump file as they are executed, so that the original
GTIDs for the transactions are used.
