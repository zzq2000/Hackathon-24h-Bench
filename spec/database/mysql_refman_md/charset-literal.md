### 12.3.6 Character String Literal Character Set and Collation

Every character string literal has a character set and a
collation.

For the simple statement `SELECT
'string'`, the string has
the connection default character set and collation defined by
the [`character_set_connection`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_character_set_connection)
and [`collation_connection`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_collation_connection) system
variables.

A character string literal may have an optional character set
introducer and `COLLATE` clause, to designate
it as a string that uses a particular character set and
collation:

```sql
[_charset_name]'string' [COLLATE collation_name]
```

The `_charset_name`
expression is formally called an
*introducer*. It tells the parser, “the
string that follows uses character set
*`charset_name`*.” An introducer
does not change the string to the introducer character set like
[`CONVERT()`](cast-functions.md#function_convert) would do. It does not
change the string value, although padding may occur. The
introducer is just a signal. See
[Section 12.3.8, “Character Set Introducers”](charset-introducer.md "12.3.8 Character Set Introducers").

Examples:

```sql
SELECT 'abc';
SELECT _latin1'abc';
SELECT _binary'abc';
SELECT _utf8mb4'abc' COLLATE utf8mb4_danish_ci;
```

Character set introducers and the `COLLATE`
clause are implemented according to standard SQL specifications.

MySQL determines the character set and collation of a character
string literal in the following manner:

- If both *`_charset_name`* and
  `COLLATE
  collation_name` are
  specified, character set
  *`charset_name`* and collation
  *`collation_name`* are used.
  *`collation_name`* must be a
  permitted collation for
  *`charset_name`*.
- If *`_charset_name`* is specified but
  `COLLATE` is not specified, character set
  *`charset_name`* and its default
  collation are used. To see the default collation for each
  character set, use the [`SHOW CHARACTER
  SET`](show-character-set.md "15.7.7.3 SHOW CHARACTER SET Statement") statement or query the
  `INFORMATION_SCHEMA`
  [`CHARACTER_SETS`](information-schema-character-sets-table.md "28.3.4 The INFORMATION_SCHEMA CHARACTER_SETS Table") table.
- If *`_charset_name`* is not specified
  but `COLLATE
  collation_name` is
  specified, the connection default character set given by the
  [`character_set_connection`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_character_set_connection)
  system variable and collation
  *`collation_name`* are used.
  *`collation_name`* must be a
  permitted collation for the connection default character
  set.
- Otherwise (neither *`_charset_name`*
  nor `COLLATE
  collation_name` is
  specified), the connection default character set and
  collation given by the
  [`character_set_connection`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_character_set_connection)
  and [`collation_connection`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_collation_connection)
  system variables are used.

Examples:

- A nonbinary string with `latin1` character
  set and `latin1_german1_ci` collation:

  ```sql
  SELECT _latin1'Müller' COLLATE latin1_german1_ci;
  ```
- A nonbinary string with `utf8mb4` character
  set and its default collation (that is,
  `utf8mb4_0900_ai_ci`):

  ```sql
  SELECT _utf8mb4'Müller';
  ```
- A binary string with `binary` character set
  and its default collation (that is,
  `binary`):

  ```sql
  SELECT _binary'Müller';
  ```
- A nonbinary string with the connection default character set
  and `utf8mb4_0900_ai_ci` collation (fails
  if the connection character set is not
  `utf8mb4`):

  ```sql
  SELECT 'Müller' COLLATE utf8mb4_0900_ai_ci;
  ```
- A string with the connection default character set and
  collation:

  ```sql
  SELECT 'Müller';
  ```

An introducer indicates the character set for the following
string, but does not change how the parser performs escape
processing within the string. Escapes are always interpreted by
the parser according to the character set given by
[`character_set_connection`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_character_set_connection).

The following examples show that escape processing occurs using
[`character_set_connection`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_character_set_connection) even
in the presence of an introducer. The examples use
[`SET NAMES`](set-names.md "15.7.6.3 SET NAMES Statement") (which changes
[`character_set_connection`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_character_set_connection), as
discussed in [Section 12.4, “Connection Character Sets and Collations”](charset-connection.md "12.4 Connection Character Sets and Collations")), and display
the resulting strings using the
[`HEX()`](string-functions.md#function_hex) function so that the exact
string contents can be seen.

Example 1:

```sql
mysql> SET NAMES latin1;
mysql> SELECT HEX('à\n'), HEX(_sjis'à\n');
+------------+-----------------+
| HEX('à\n')  | HEX(_sjis'à\n')  |
+------------+-----------------+
| E00A       | E00A            |
+------------+-----------------+
```

Here, `à` (hexadecimal value
`E0`) is followed by `\n`, the
escape sequence for newline. The escape sequence is interpreted
using the
[`character_set_connection`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_character_set_connection) value
of `latin1` to produce a literal newline
(hexadecimal value `0A`). This happens even for
the second string. That is, the `_sjis`
introducer does not affect the parser's escape processing.

Example 2:

```sql
mysql> SET NAMES sjis;
mysql> SELECT HEX('à\n'), HEX(_latin1'à\n');
+------------+-------------------+
| HEX('à\n')  | HEX(_latin1'à\n')  |
+------------+-------------------+
| E05C6E     | E05C6E            |
+------------+-------------------+
```

Here, [`character_set_connection`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_character_set_connection)
is `sjis`, a character set in which the
sequence of `à` followed by
`\` (hexadecimal values `05`
and `5C`) is a valid multibyte character.
Hence, the first two bytes of the string are interpreted as a
single `sjis` character, and the
`\` is not interpreted as an escape character.
The following `n` (hexadecimal value
`6E`) is not interpreted as part of an escape
sequence. This is true even for the second string; the
`_latin1` introducer does not affect escape
processing.
