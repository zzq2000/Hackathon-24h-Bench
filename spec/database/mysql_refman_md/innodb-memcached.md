Important

The `InnoDB` **memcached** plugin
was removed in MySQL 8.3.0, and was deprecated in MySQL 8.0.22.

The `InnoDB` **memcached** plugin
(`daemon_memcached`) provides an integrated
**memcached** daemon that automatically stores and
retrieves data from `InnoDB` tables, turning the
MySQL server into a fast “key-value store”. Instead of
formulating queries in SQL, you can use simple
`get`, `set`, and
`incr` operations that avoid the performance
overhead associated with SQL parsing and constructing a query
optimization plan. You can also access the same
`InnoDB` tables through SQL for convenience,
complex queries, bulk operations, and other strengths of traditional
database software.

This “NoSQL-style” interface uses the
**memcached** API to speed up database operations,
letting `InnoDB` handle memory caching using its
[buffer pool](glossary.md#glos_buffer_pool "buffer pool") mechanism. Data
modified through **memcached** operations such as
`add`, `set`, and
`incr` are stored to disk, in
`InnoDB` tables. The combination of
**memcached** simplicity and
`InnoDB` reliability and consistency provides users
with the best of both worlds, as explained in
[Section 17.20.1, “Benefits of the InnoDB memcached Plugin”](innodb-memcached-benefits.md "17.20.1 Benefits of the InnoDB memcached Plugin"). For an architectural
overview, see [Section 17.20.2, “InnoDB memcached Architecture”](innodb-memcached-intro.md "17.20.2 InnoDB memcached Architecture").
