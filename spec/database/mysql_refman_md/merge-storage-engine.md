## 18.7 The MERGE Storage Engine

[18.7.1 MERGE Table Advantages and Disadvantages](merge-table-advantages.md)

[18.7.2 MERGE Table Problems](merge-table-problems.md)

The `MERGE` storage engine, also known as the
`MRG_MyISAM` engine, is a collection of identical
`MyISAM` tables that can be used as one.
“Identical” means that all tables have identical column
data types and index information. You cannot merge
`MyISAM` tables in which the columns are listed in
a different order, do not have exactly the same data types in
corresponding columns, or have the indexes in different order.
However, any or all of the `MyISAM` tables can be
compressed with [**myisampack**](myisampack.md "6.6.6 myisampack — Generate Compressed, Read-Only MyISAM Tables"). See
[Section 6.6.6, “myisampack — Generate Compressed, Read-Only MyISAM Tables”](myisampack.md "6.6.6 myisampack — Generate Compressed, Read-Only MyISAM Tables"). Differences between tables such as
these do not matter:

- Names of corresponding columns and indexes can differ.
- Comments for tables, columns, and indexes can differ.
- Table options such as `AVG_ROW_LENGTH`,
  `MAX_ROWS`, or `PACK_KEYS` can
  differ.

An alternative to a `MERGE` table is a partitioned
table, which stores partitions of a single table in separate files
and enables some operations to be performed more efficiently. For
more information, see [Chapter 26, *Partitioning*](partitioning.md "Chapter 26 Partitioning").

When you create a `MERGE` table, MySQL creates a
`.MRG` file on disk that contains the names of
the underlying `MyISAM` tables that should be used
as one. The table format of the `MERGE` table is
stored in the MySQL data dictionary. The underlying tables do not
have to be in the same database as the `MERGE`
table.

You can use [`SELECT`](select.md "15.2.13 SELECT Statement"),
[`DELETE`](delete.md "15.2.2 DELETE Statement"),
[`UPDATE`](update.md "15.2.17 UPDATE Statement"), and
[`INSERT`](insert.md "15.2.7 INSERT Statement") on `MERGE`
tables. You must have [`SELECT`](privileges-provided.md#priv_select),
[`DELETE`](privileges-provided.md#priv_delete), and
[`UPDATE`](privileges-provided.md#priv_update) privileges on the
`MyISAM` tables that you map to a
`MERGE` table.

Note

The use of `MERGE` tables entails the following
security issue: If a user has access to `MyISAM`
table *`t`*, that user can create a
`MERGE` table *`m`* that
accesses *`t`*. However, if the user's
privileges on *`t`* are subsequently
revoked, the user can continue to access
*`t`* by doing so through
*`m`*.

Use of [`DROP TABLE`](drop-table.md "15.1.32 DROP TABLE Statement") with a
`MERGE` table drops only the
`MERGE` specification. The underlying tables are
not affected.

To create a `MERGE` table, you must specify a
`UNION=(list-of-tables)`
option that indicates which `MyISAM` tables to use.
You can optionally specify an `INSERT_METHOD`
option to control how inserts into the `MERGE`
table take place. Use a value of `FIRST` or
`LAST` to cause inserts to be made in the first or
last underlying table, respectively. If you specify no
`INSERT_METHOD` option or if you specify it with a
value of `NO`, inserts into the
`MERGE` table are not permitted and attempts to do
so result in an error.

The following example shows how to create a `MERGE`
table:

```sql
mysql> CREATE TABLE t1 (
    ->    a INT NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
    ->    message CHAR(20)) ENGINE=MyISAM;
mysql> CREATE TABLE t2 (
    ->    a INT NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
    ->    message CHAR(20)) ENGINE=MyISAM;
mysql> INSERT INTO t1 (message) VALUES ('Testing'),('table'),('t1');
mysql> INSERT INTO t2 (message) VALUES ('Testing'),('table'),('t2');
mysql> CREATE TABLE total (
    ->    a INT NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT,
    ->    message CHAR(20), INDEX(a))
    ->    ENGINE=MERGE UNION=(t1,t2) INSERT_METHOD=LAST;
```

Column `a` is indexed as a `PRIMARY
KEY` in the underlying `MyISAM` tables,
but not in the `MERGE` table. There it is indexed
but not as a `PRIMARY KEY` because a
`MERGE` table cannot enforce uniqueness over the
set of underlying tables. (Similarly, a column with a
`UNIQUE` index in the underlying tables should be
indexed in the `MERGE` table but not as a
`UNIQUE` index.)

After creating the `MERGE` table, you can use it to
issue queries that operate on the group of tables as a whole:

```sql
mysql> SELECT * FROM total;
+---+---------+
| a | message |
+---+---------+
| 1 | Testing |
| 2 | table   |
| 3 | t1      |
| 1 | Testing |
| 2 | table   |
| 3 | t2      |
+---+---------+
```

To remap a `MERGE` table to a different collection
of `MyISAM` tables, you can use one of the
following methods:

- `DROP` the `MERGE` table and
  re-create it.
- Use `ALTER TABLE tbl_name
  UNION=(...)` to change the list of underlying tables.

  It is also possible to use `ALTER TABLE ...
  UNION=()` (that is, with an empty
  [`UNION`](union.md "15.2.18 UNION Clause") clause) to remove all of
  the underlying tables. However, in this case, the table is
  effectively empty and inserts fail because there is no
  underlying table to take new rows. Such a table might be useful
  as a template for creating new `MERGE` tables
  with [`CREATE
  TABLE ... LIKE`](create-table-like.md "15.1.20.3 CREATE TABLE ... LIKE Statement").

The underlying table definitions and indexes must conform closely to
the definition of the `MERGE` table. Conformance is
checked when a table that is part of a `MERGE`
table is opened, not when the `MERGE` table is
created. If any table fails the conformance checks, the operation
that triggered the opening of the table fails. This means that
changes to the definitions of tables within a
`MERGE` may cause a failure when the
`MERGE` table is accessed. The conformance checks
applied to each table are:

- The underlying table and the `MERGE` table must
  have the same number of columns.
- The column order in the underlying table and the
  `MERGE` table must match.
- Additionally, the specification for each corresponding column in
  the parent `MERGE` table and the underlying
  tables are compared and must satisfy these checks:

  - The column type in the underlying table and the
    `MERGE` table must be equal.
  - The column length in the underlying table and the
    `MERGE` table must be equal.
  - The column of the underlying table and the
    `MERGE` table can be
    `NULL`.
- The underlying table must have at least as many indexes as the
  `MERGE` table. The underlying table may have
  more indexes than the `MERGE` table, but cannot
  have fewer.

  Note

  A known issue exists where indexes on the same columns must be
  in identical order, in both the `MERGE` table
  and the underlying `MyISAM` table. See Bug
  #33653.

  Each index must satisfy these checks:

  - The index type of the underlying table and the
    `MERGE` table must be the same.
  - The number of index parts (that is, multiple columns within
    a compound index) in the index definition for the underlying
    table and the `MERGE` table must be the
    same.
  - For each index part:

    - Index part lengths must be equal.
    - Index part types must be equal.
    - Index part languages must be equal.
    - Check whether index parts can be
      `NULL`.

If a `MERGE` table cannot be opened or used because
of a problem with an underlying table, [`CHECK
TABLE`](check-table.md "15.7.3.2 CHECK TABLE Statement") displays information about which table caused the
problem.
