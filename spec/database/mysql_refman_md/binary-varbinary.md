### 13.3.3 The BINARY and VARBINARY Types

The `BINARY` and `VARBINARY`
types are similar to [`CHAR`](char.md "13.3.2 The CHAR and VARCHAR Types") and
[`VARCHAR`](char.md "13.3.2 The CHAR and VARCHAR Types"), except that they store
binary strings rather than nonbinary strings. That is, they
store byte strings rather than character strings. This means
they have the `binary` character set and
collation, and comparison and sorting are based on the numeric
values of the bytes in the values.

The permissible maximum length is the same for
`BINARY` and `VARBINARY` as it
is for [`CHAR`](char.md "13.3.2 The CHAR and VARCHAR Types") and
[`VARCHAR`](char.md "13.3.2 The CHAR and VARCHAR Types"), except that the length
for `BINARY` and `VARBINARY`
is measured in bytes rather than characters.

The `BINARY` and `VARBINARY`
data types are distinct from the `CHAR BINARY`
and `VARCHAR BINARY` data types. For the latter
types, the `BINARY` attribute does not cause
the column to be treated as a binary string column. Instead, it
causes the binary (`_bin`) collation for the
column character set (or the table default character set if no
column character set is specified) to be used, and the column
itself stores nonbinary character strings rather than binary
byte strings. For example, if the default character set is
`utf8mb4`, `CHAR(5) BINARY` is
treated as `CHAR(5) CHARACTER SET utf8mb4 COLLATE
utf8mb4_bin`. This differs from
`BINARY(5)`, which stores 5-byte binary strings
that have the `binary` character set and
collation. For information about the differences between the
`binary` collation of the
`binary` character set and the
`_bin` collations of nonbinary character sets,
see [Section 12.8.5, “The binary Collation Compared to \_bin Collations”](charset-binary-collations.md "12.8.5 The binary Collation Compared to _bin Collations").

If strict SQL mode is not enabled and you assign a value to a
`BINARY` or `VARBINARY` column
that exceeds the column's maximum length, the value is truncated
to fit and a warning is generated. For cases of truncation, to
cause an error to occur (rather than a warning) and suppress
insertion of the value, use strict SQL mode. See
[Section 7.1.11, “Server SQL Modes”](sql-mode.md "7.1.11 Server SQL Modes").

When `BINARY` values are stored, they are
right-padded with the pad value to the specified length. The pad
value is `0x00` (the zero byte). Values are
right-padded with `0x00` for inserts, and no
trailing bytes are removed for retrievals. All bytes are
significant in comparisons, including `ORDER
BY` and `DISTINCT` operations.
`0x00` and space differ in comparisons, with
`0x00` sorting before space.

Example: For a `BINARY(3)` column,
`'a '` becomes
`'a \0'` when inserted.
`'a\0'` becomes `'a\0\0'` when
inserted. Both inserted values remain unchanged for retrievals.

For `VARBINARY`, there is no padding for
inserts and no bytes are stripped for retrievals. All bytes are
significant in comparisons, including `ORDER
BY` and `DISTINCT` operations.
`0x00` and space differ in comparisons, with
`0x00` sorting before space.

For those cases where trailing pad bytes are stripped or
comparisons ignore them, if a column has an index that requires
unique values, inserting values into the column that differ only
in number of trailing pad bytes results in a duplicate-key
error. For example, if a table contains `'a'`,
an attempt to store `'a\0'` causes a
duplicate-key error.

You should consider the preceding padding and stripping
characteristics carefully if you plan to use the
`BINARY` data type for storing binary data and
you require that the value retrieved be exactly the same as the
value stored. The following example illustrates how
`0x00`-padding of `BINARY`
values affects column value comparisons:

```sql
mysql> CREATE TABLE t (c BINARY(3));
Query OK, 0 rows affected (0.01 sec)

mysql> INSERT INTO t SET c = 'a';
Query OK, 1 row affected (0.01 sec)

mysql> SELECT HEX(c), c = 'a', c = 'a\0\0' from t;
+--------+---------+-------------+
| HEX(c) | c = 'a' | c = 'a\0\0' |
+--------+---------+-------------+
| 610000 |       0 |           1 |
+--------+---------+-------------+
1 row in set (0.09 sec)
```

If the value retrieved must be the same as the value specified
for storage with no padding, it might be preferable to use
`VARBINARY` or one of the
[`BLOB`](blob.md "13.3.4 The BLOB and TEXT Types") data types instead.

Note

Within the [**mysql**](mysql.md "6.5.1 mysql — The MySQL Command-Line Client") client, binary strings
display using hexadecimal notation, depending on the value of
the [`--binary-as-hex`](mysql-command-options.md#option_mysql_binary-as-hex). For more
information about that option, see [Section 6.5.1, “mysql — The MySQL Command-Line Client”](mysql.md "6.5.1 mysql — The MySQL Command-Line Client").
