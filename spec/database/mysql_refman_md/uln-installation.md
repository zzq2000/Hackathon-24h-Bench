## 2.6 Installing MySQL Using Unbreakable Linux Network (ULN)

Linux supports a number of different solutions for installing MySQL,
covered in [Section 2.5, “Installing MySQL on Linux”](linux-installation.md "2.5 Installing MySQL on Linux"). One of the methods,
covered in this section, is installing from Oracle's Unbreakable
Linux Network (ULN). You can find information about Oracle Linux and
ULN under <http://linux.oracle.com/>.

To use ULN, you need to obtain a ULN login and register the machine
used for installation with ULN. This is described in detail in the
[ULN FAQ](https://linux.oracle.com/uln_faq.html).
The page also describes how to install and update packages.

Both Community and Commercial packages are supported, and each
offers three MySQL channels:

- `Server`: MySQL Server
- `Connectors`: MySQL Connector/C++, MySQL
  Connector/J, MySQL Connector/ODBC, and MySQL Connector/Python.
- `Tools`: MySQL Router, MySQL Shell, and
  MySQL Workbench

The Community channels are available to all ULN users.

Accessing commercial MySQL ULN packages at oracle.linux.com requires
you to provide a CSI with a valid commercial license for MySQL
(Enterprise or Standard). As of this writing, valid purchases are
60944, 60945, 64911, and 64912. The appropriate CSI makes commercial
MySQL subscription channels available in your ULN GUI interface.

Once MySQL has been installed using ULN, you can find information on
starting and stopping the server, and more, at
[Section 2.5.7, “Installing MySQL on Linux from the Native Software Repositories”](linux-installation-native.md "2.5.7 Installing MySQL on Linux from the Native Software Repositories"), particularly under
[Section 2.5.4, “Installing MySQL on Linux Using RPM Packages from Oracle”](linux-installation-rpm.md "2.5.4 Installing MySQL on Linux Using RPM Packages from Oracle").

If you are changing your package source to use ULN and not changing
which build of MySQL you are using, then back up your data, remove
your existing binaries, and replace them with those from ULN. If a
change of build is involved, we recommend the backup be a dump
([**mysqldump**](mysqldump.md "6.5.4 mysqldump — A Database Backup Program") or [**mysqlpump**](mysqlpump.md "6.5.6 mysqlpump — A Database Backup Program") or
from
[MySQL
Shell's backup utility](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/mysql-shell/8.0/en/mysql-shell-utilities-dump-instance-schema.html)) just in case you need to rebuild your
data after the new binaries are in place. If this shift to ULN
crosses a version boundary, consult this section before proceeding:
[Chapter 3, *Upgrading MySQL*](upgrading.md "Chapter 3 Upgrading MySQL").

Note

Oracle Linux 8 is supported as of MySQL 8.0.17, and the community
Tools and Connectors channels were added with the MySQL 8.0.24
release.
