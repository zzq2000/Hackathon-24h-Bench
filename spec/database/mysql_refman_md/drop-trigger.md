### 15.1.34 DROP TRIGGER Statement

```sql
DROP TRIGGER [IF EXISTS] [schema_name.]trigger_name
```

This statement drops a trigger. The schema (database) name is
optional. If the schema is omitted, the trigger is dropped from
the default schema. [`DROP TRIGGER`](drop-trigger.md "15.1.34 DROP TRIGGER Statement")
requires the [`TRIGGER`](privileges-provided.md#priv_trigger) privilege for
the table associated with the trigger.

Use `IF EXISTS` to prevent an error from
occurring for a trigger that does not exist. A
`NOTE` is generated for a nonexistent trigger
when using `IF EXISTS`. See
[Section 15.7.7.42, “SHOW WARNINGS Statement”](show-warnings.md "15.7.7.42 SHOW WARNINGS Statement").

Triggers for a table are also dropped if you drop the table.
