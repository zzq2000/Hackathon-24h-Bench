## 3.15 Copying MySQL Databases to Another Machine

In cases where you need to transfer databases between different
architectures, you can use [**mysqldump**](mysqldump.md "6.5.4 mysqldump — A Database Backup Program") to create
a file containing SQL statements. You can then transfer the file
to the other machine and feed it as input to the
[**mysql**](mysql.md "6.5.1 mysql — The MySQL Command-Line Client") client.

Use [**mysqldump --help**](mysqldump.md "6.5.4 mysqldump — A Database Backup Program") to see what options are
available.

Note

If GTIDs are in use on the server where you create the dump
([`gtid_mode=ON`](replication-options-gtids.md#sysvar_gtid_mode)), by default,
[**mysqldump**](mysqldump.md "6.5.4 mysqldump — A Database Backup Program") includes the contents of the
[`gtid_executed`](replication-options-gtids.md#sysvar_gtid_executed) set in the dump
to transfer these to the new machine. The results of this can
vary depending on the MySQL Server versions involved. Check the
description for **mysqldump's**
`--set-gtid-purged` option to find what happens
with the versions you are using, and how to change the behavior
if the outcome of the default behavior is not suitable for your
situation.

The easiest (although not the fastest) way to move a database
between two machines is to run the following commands on the
machine on which the database is located:

```terminal
mysqladmin -h 'other_hostname' create db_name
mysqldump db_name | mysql -h 'other_hostname' db_name
```

If you want to copy a database from a remote machine over a slow
network, you can use these commands:

```terminal
mysqladmin create db_name
mysqldump -h 'other_hostname' --compress db_name | mysql db_name
```

You can also store the dump in a file, transfer the file to the
target machine, and then load the file into the database there.
For example, you can dump a database to a compressed file on the
source machine like this:

```terminal
mysqldump --quick db_name | gzip > db_name.gz
```

Transfer the file containing the database contents to the target
machine and run these commands there:

```terminal
mysqladmin create db_name
gunzip < db_name.gz | mysql db_name
```

You can also use [**mysqldump**](mysqldump.md "6.5.4 mysqldump — A Database Backup Program") and
[**mysqlimport**](mysqlimport.md "6.5.5 mysqlimport — A Data Import Program") to transfer the database. For large
tables, this is much faster than simply using
[**mysqldump**](mysqldump.md "6.5.4 mysqldump — A Database Backup Program"). In the following commands,
*`DUMPDIR`* represents the full path name
of the directory you use to store the output from
[**mysqldump**](mysqldump.md "6.5.4 mysqldump — A Database Backup Program").

First, create the directory for the output files and dump the
database:

```terminal
mkdir DUMPDIR
mysqldump --tab=DUMPDIR
   db_name
```

Then transfer the files in the *`DUMPDIR`*
directory to some corresponding directory on the target machine
and load the files into MySQL there:

```terminal
mysqladmin create db_name           # create database
cat DUMPDIR/*.sql | mysql db_name   # create tables in database
mysqlimport db_name
   DUMPDIR/*.txt   # load data into tables
```

Do not forget to copy the `mysql` database
because that is where the grant tables are stored. You might have
to run commands as the MySQL `root` user on the
new machine until you have the `mysql` database
in place.

After you import the `mysql` database on the new
machine, execute [**mysqladmin flush-privileges**](mysqladmin.md "6.5.2 mysqladmin — A MySQL Server Administration Program") so
that the server reloads the grant table information.
