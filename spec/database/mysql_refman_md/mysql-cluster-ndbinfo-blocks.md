#### 25.6.16.5 The ndbinfo blocks Table

The `blocks` table is a static table which
simply contains the names and internal IDs of all NDB kernel
blocks (see [NDB Kernel Blocks](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/ndb-internals/en/ndb-internals-kernel-blocks.html)). It
is for use by the other
[`ndbinfo`](mysql-cluster-ndbinfo.md "25.6.16 ndbinfo: The NDB Cluster Information Database") tables (most of which
are actually views) in mapping block numbers to block names for
producing human-readable output.

The `blocks` table contains the following
columns:

- `block_number`

  Block number
- `block_name`

  Block name

##### Notes

To obtain a list of all block names, simply execute
`SELECT block_name FROM ndbinfo.blocks`.
Although this is a static table, its content can vary between
different NDB Cluster releases.
