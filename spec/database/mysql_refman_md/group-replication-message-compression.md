### 20.7.4 Message Compression

For messages sent between online group members, Group Replication
enables message compression by default. Whether a specific message
is compressed depends on the threshold that you configure using
the
[`group_replication_compression_threshold`](group-replication-system-variables.md#sysvar_group_replication_compression_threshold)
system variable. Messages that have a payload larger than the
specified number of bytes are compressed.

The default compression threshold is 1000000 bytes. You could use
the following statements to increase the compression threshold to
2MB, for example:

```sql
STOP GROUP_REPLICATION;
SET GLOBAL group_replication_compression_threshold = 2097152;
START GROUP_REPLICATION;
```

If you set
[`group_replication_compression_threshold`](group-replication-system-variables.md#sysvar_group_replication_compression_threshold)
to zero, message compression is disabled.

Group Replication uses the LZ4 compression algorithm to compress
messages sent in the group. Note that the maximum supported input
size for the LZ4 compression algorithm is 2113929216 bytes. This
limit is lower than the maximum possible value for the
[`group_replication_compression_threshold`](group-replication-system-variables.md#sysvar_group_replication_compression_threshold)
system variable, which is matched to the maximum message size
accepted by XCom. The LZ4 maximum input size is therefore a
practical limit for message compression, and transactions above
this size cannot be committed when message compression is enabled.
With the LZ4 compression algorithm, do not set a value greater
than 2113929216 bytes for
[`group_replication_compression_threshold`](group-replication-system-variables.md#sysvar_group_replication_compression_threshold).

The value of
[`group_replication_compression_threshold`](group-replication-system-variables.md#sysvar_group_replication_compression_threshold)
is not required by Group Replication to be the same on all group
members. However, it is advisable to set the same value on all
group members in order to avoid unnecessary rollback of
transactions, failure of message delivery, or failure of message
recovery.

From MySQL 8.0.18, you can also configure compression for messages
sent for distributed recovery by the method of state transfer from
a donor's binary log. Compression for these messages, which are
sent from a donor already in the group to a joining member, is
controlled separately using the
[`group_replication_recovery_compression_algorithms`](group-replication-system-variables.md#sysvar_group_replication_recovery_compression_algorithms)
and
[`group_replication_recovery_zstd_compression_level`](group-replication-system-variables.md#sysvar_group_replication_recovery_zstd_compression_level)
system variables. For more information, see
[Section 6.2.8, “Connection Compression Control”](connection-compression-control.md "6.2.8 Connection Compression Control").

Binary log transaction compression (available as of MySQL 8.0.20),
which is activated by the
[`binlog_transaction_compression`](replication-options-binary-log.md#sysvar_binlog_transaction_compression)
system variable, can also be used to save bandwidth. The
transaction payloads remain compressed when they are transferred
between group members. If you use binary log transaction
compression in combination with Group Replication's message
compression, message compression has less opportunity to act on
the data, but can still compress headers and those events and
transaction payloads that are uncompressed. For more information
on binary log transaction compression, see
[Section 7.4.4.5, “Binary Log Transaction Compression”](binary-log-transaction-compression.md "7.4.4.5 Binary Log Transaction Compression").

Compression for messages sent in the group happens at the group
communication engine level, before the data is handed over to the
group communication thread, so it takes place within the context
of the `mysql` user session thread. If the
message payload size exceeds the threshold set by
[`group_replication_compression_threshold`](group-replication-system-variables.md#sysvar_group_replication_compression_threshold),
the transaction payload is compressed before being sent out to the
group, and decompressed when it is received. Upon receiving a
message, the member checks the message envelope to verify whether
it is compressed or not. If needed, then the member decompresses
the transaction, before delivering it to the upper layer. This
process is shown in the following figure.

![The MySQL Group Replication plugin architecture is shown as described in an earlier topic, with the five layers of the plugin positioned between the MySQL server and the replication group. Compression and decompression are handled by the Group Communication System API, which is the fourth layer of the Group Replication plugin. The group communication engine (the fifth layer of the plugin) and the group members use the compressed transactions with the smaller data size. The MySQL Server core and the three higher layers of the Group Replication plugin (the APIs, the capture, applier, and recovery components, and the replication protocol module) use the original transactions with the larger data size.](images/gr-compress-decompress.png)

When network bandwidth is a bottleneck, message compression can
provide up to 30-40% throughput improvement at the group
communication level. This is especially important within the
context of large groups of servers under load. The TCP
peer-to-peer nature of the interconnections between
*N* participants in the group makes the sender
send the same amount of data *N* times.
Furthermore, binary logs are likely to exhibit a high compression
ratio. This makes compression a compelling feature for Group
Replication workloads that contain large transactions.
