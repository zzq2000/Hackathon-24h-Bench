### 8.2.11 Account Categories

As of MySQL 8.0.16, MySQL incorporates the concept of user account
categories, based on the
[`SYSTEM_USER`](privileges-provided.md#priv_system-user) privilege.

- [System and Regular Accounts](account-categories.md#system-user-accounts "System and Regular Accounts")
- [Operations Affected by the SYSTEM\_USER Privilege](account-categories.md#system-user-operations "Operations Affected by the SYSTEM_USER Privilege")
- [System and Regular Sessions](account-categories.md#system-user-sessions "System and Regular Sessions")
- [Protecting System Accounts Against Manipulation by Regular Accounts](account-categories.md#protecting-system-accounts "Protecting System Accounts Against Manipulation by Regular Accounts")

#### System and Regular Accounts

MySQL incorporates the concept of user account categories, with
system and regular users distinguished according to whether they
have the [`SYSTEM_USER`](privileges-provided.md#priv_system-user) privilege:

- A user with the [`SYSTEM_USER`](privileges-provided.md#priv_system-user)
  privilege is a system user.
- A user without the
  [`SYSTEM_USER`](privileges-provided.md#priv_system-user) privilege is a
  regular user.

The [`SYSTEM_USER`](privileges-provided.md#priv_system-user) privilege has an
effect on the accounts to which a given user can apply its other
privileges, as well as whether the user is protected from other
accounts:

- A system user can modify both system and regular accounts.
  That is, a user who has the appropriate privileges to
  perform a given operation on regular accounts is enabled by
  possession of [`SYSTEM_USER`](privileges-provided.md#priv_system-user) to
  also perform the operation on system accounts. A system
  account can be modified only by system users with
  appropriate privileges, not by regular users.
- A regular user with appropriate privileges can modify
  regular accounts, but not system accounts. A regular account
  can be modified by both system and regular users with
  appropriate privileges.

If a user has the appropriate privileges to perform a given
operation on regular accounts,
[`SYSTEM_USER`](privileges-provided.md#priv_system-user) enables the user to
also perform the operation on system accounts.
[`SYSTEM_USER`](privileges-provided.md#priv_system-user) does not imply any
other privilege, so the ability to perform a given account
operation remains predicated on possession of any other required
privileges. For example, if a user can grant the
[`SELECT`](privileges-provided.md#priv_select) and
[`UPDATE`](privileges-provided.md#priv_update) privileges to regular
accounts, then with [`SYSTEM_USER`](privileges-provided.md#priv_system-user)
the user can also grant [`SELECT`](privileges-provided.md#priv_select)
and [`UPDATE`](privileges-provided.md#priv_update) to system accounts.

The distinction between system and regular accounts enables
better control over certain account administration issues by
protecting accounts that have the
[`SYSTEM_USER`](privileges-provided.md#priv_system-user) privilege from
accounts that do not have the privilege. For example, the
[`CREATE USER`](privileges-provided.md#priv_create-user) privilege enables not
only creation of new accounts, but modification and removal of
existing accounts. Without the system user concept, a user who
has the [`CREATE USER`](privileges-provided.md#priv_create-user) privilege can
modify or drop any existing account, including the
`root` account. The concept of system user
enables restricting modifications to the `root`
account (itself a system account) so they can be made only by
system users. Regular users with the [`CREATE
USER`](privileges-provided.md#priv_create-user) privilege can still modify or drop existing
accounts, but only regular accounts.

#### Operations Affected by the SYSTEM\_USER Privilege

The [`SYSTEM_USER`](privileges-provided.md#priv_system-user) privilege affects
these operations:

- Account manipulation.

  Account manipulation includes creating and dropping
  accounts, granting and revoking privileges, changing account
  authentication characteristics such as credentials or
  authentication plugin, and changing other account
  characteristics such as password expiration policy.

  The [`SYSTEM_USER`](privileges-provided.md#priv_system-user) privilege is
  required to manipulate system accounts using
  account-management statements such as
  [`CREATE USER`](create-user.md "15.7.1.3 CREATE USER Statement") and
  [`GRANT`](grant.md "15.7.1.6 GRANT Statement"). To prevent an account
  from modifying system accounts this way, make it a regular
  account by not granting it the
  [`SYSTEM_USER`](privileges-provided.md#priv_system-user) privilege.
  (However, to fully protect system accounts against regular
  accounts, you must also withhold modification privileges for
  the `mysql` system schema from regular
  accounts. See [Protecting System Accounts Against Manipulation by Regular Accounts](account-categories.md#protecting-system-accounts "Protecting System Accounts Against Manipulation by Regular Accounts").)
- Killing current sessions and statements executing within
  them.

  To kill a session or statement that is executing with the
  [`SYSTEM_USER`](privileges-provided.md#priv_system-user) privilege, your
  own session must have the
  [`SYSTEM_USER`](privileges-provided.md#priv_system-user) privilege, in
  addition to any other required privilege
  ([`CONNECTION_ADMIN`](privileges-provided.md#priv_connection-admin) or the
  deprecated [`SUPER`](privileges-provided.md#priv_super) privilege).

  From MySQL 8.0.30, if the user that puts a server in offline
  mode does not have the
  [`SYSTEM_USER`](privileges-provided.md#priv_system-user) privilege,
  connected client users who have the
  [`SYSTEM_USER`](privileges-provided.md#priv_system-user) privilege are
  also not disconnected. However, these users cannot initiate
  new connections to the server while it is in offline mode,
  unless they have the
  [`CONNECTION_ADMIN`](privileges-provided.md#priv_connection-admin) or
  [`SUPER`](privileges-provided.md#priv_super)
  privilege as well. It is only their existing connection that
  is not terminated, because the
  [`SYSTEM_USER`](privileges-provided.md#priv_system-user) privilege is
  required to do that.

  Prior to MySQL 8.0.16,
  [`CONNECTION_ADMIN`](privileges-provided.md#priv_connection-admin) privilege
  (or the deprecated [`SUPER`](privileges-provided.md#priv_super)
  privilege) is sufficient to kill any session or statement.
- Setting the `DEFINER` attribute for stored
  objects.

  To set the `DEFINER` attribute for a stored
  object to an account that has the
  [`SYSTEM_USER`](privileges-provided.md#priv_system-user) privilege, you
  must have the [`SYSTEM_USER`](privileges-provided.md#priv_system-user)
  privilege, in addition to any other required privilege
  ([`SET_USER_ID`](privileges-provided.md#priv_set-user-id) or the
  deprecated [`SUPER`](privileges-provided.md#priv_super) privilege).

  Prior to MySQL 8.0.16, the
  [`SET_USER_ID`](privileges-provided.md#priv_set-user-id) privilege (or the
  deprecated [`SUPER`](privileges-provided.md#priv_super) privilege)
  is sufficient to specify any `DEFINER`
  value for stored objects.
- Specifying mandatory roles.

  A role that has the
  [`SYSTEM_USER`](privileges-provided.md#priv_system-user) privilege cannot
  be listed in the value of the
  [`mandatory_roles`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_mandatory_roles) system
  variable.

  Prior to MySQL 8.0.16, any role can be listed in
  [`mandatory_roles`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_mandatory_roles).
- Overriding “abort” items in MySQL Enterprise
  Audit’s audit log filter.

  From MySQL 8.0.28, accounts with the
  [`SYSTEM_USER`](privileges-provided.md#priv_system-user) privilege are
  automatically assigned the
  [`AUDIT_ABORT_EXEMPT`](privileges-provided.md#priv_audit-abort-exempt) privilege,
  so that queries from the account are always executed even if
  an “abort” item in the audit log filter would
  block them. Accounts with the
  [`SYSTEM_USER`](privileges-provided.md#priv_system-user) privilege can
  therefore be used to regain access to a system following an
  audit misconfiguration. See [Section 8.4.5, “MySQL Enterprise Audit”](audit-log.md "8.4.5 MySQL Enterprise Audit").

#### System and Regular Sessions

Sessions executing within the server are distinguished as system
or regular sessions, similar to the distinction between system
and regular users:

- A session that possesses the
  [`SYSTEM_USER`](privileges-provided.md#priv_system-user) privilege is a
  system session.
- A session that does not possess the
  [`SYSTEM_USER`](privileges-provided.md#priv_system-user) privilege is a
  regular session.

A regular session is able to perform only operations permitted
to regular users. A system session is additionally able to
perform operations permitted only to system users.

The privileges possessed by a session are those granted directly
to its underlying account, plus those granted to all roles
currently active within the session. Thus, a session may be a
system session because its account has been granted the
[`SYSTEM_USER`](privileges-provided.md#priv_system-user) privilege directly,
or because the session has activated a role that has the
[`SYSTEM_USER`](privileges-provided.md#priv_system-user) privilege. Roles
granted to an account that are not active within the session do
not affect session privileges.

Because activating and deactivating roles can change the
privileges possessed by sessions, a session may change from a
regular session to a system session or vice versa. If a session
activates or deactivates a role that has the
[`SYSTEM_USER`](privileges-provided.md#priv_system-user) privilege, the
appropriate change between regular and system session takes
place immediately, for that session only:

- If a regular session activates a role with the
  [`SYSTEM_USER`](privileges-provided.md#priv_system-user) privilege, the
  session becomes a system session.
- If a system session deactivates a role with the
  [`SYSTEM_USER`](privileges-provided.md#priv_system-user) privilege, the
  session becomes a regular session, unless some other role
  with the [`SYSTEM_USER`](privileges-provided.md#priv_system-user)
  privilege remains active.

These operations have no effect on existing sessions:

- If the [`SYSTEM_USER`](privileges-provided.md#priv_system-user) privilege
  is granted to or revoked from an account, existing sessions
  for the account do not change between regular and system
  sessions. The grant or revoke operation affects only
  sessions for subsequent connections by the account.
- Statements executed by a stored object invoked within a
  session execute with the system or regular status of the
  parent session, even if the object
  `DEFINER` attribute names a system account.

Because role activation affects only sessions and not accounts,
granting a role that has the
[`SYSTEM_USER`](privileges-provided.md#priv_system-user) privilege to a
regular account does not protect that account against regular
users. The role protects only sessions for the account in which
the role has been activated, and protects the session only
against being killed by regular sessions.

#### Protecting System Accounts Against Manipulation by Regular Accounts

Account manipulation includes creating and dropping accounts,
granting and revoking privileges, changing account
authentication characteristics such as credentials or
authentication plugin, and changing other account
characteristics such as password expiration policy.

Account manipulation can be done two ways:

- By using account-management statements such as
  [`CREATE USER`](create-user.md "15.7.1.3 CREATE USER Statement") and
  [`GRANT`](grant.md "15.7.1.6 GRANT Statement"). This is the preferred
  method.
- By direct grant-table modification using statements such as
  [`INSERT`](insert.md "15.2.7 INSERT Statement") and
  [`UPDATE`](update.md "15.2.17 UPDATE Statement"). This method is
  discouraged but possible for users with the appropriate
  privileges on the `mysql` system schema
  that contains the grant tables.

To fully protect system accounts against modification by a given
account, make it a regular account and do not grant it
modification privileges for the `mysql` schema:

- The [`SYSTEM_USER`](privileges-provided.md#priv_system-user) privilege is
  required to manipulate system accounts using
  account-management statements. To prevent an account from
  modifying system accounts this way, make it a regular
  account by not granting
  [`SYSTEM_USER`](privileges-provided.md#priv_system-user) to it. This
  includes not granting
  [`SYSTEM_USER`](privileges-provided.md#priv_system-user) to any roles
  granted to the account.
- Privileges for the `mysql` schema enable
  manipulation of system accounts through direct modification
  of the grant tables, even if the modifying account is a
  regular account. To restrict unauthorized direct
  modification of system accounts by a regular account, do not
  grant modification privileges for the
  `mysql` schema to the account (or any roles
  granted to the account). If a regular account must have
  global privileges that apply to all schemas,
  `mysql` schema modifications can be
  prevented using privilege restrictions imposed using partial
  revokes. See [Section 8.2.12, “Privilege Restriction Using Partial Revokes”](partial-revokes.md "8.2.12 Privilege Restriction Using Partial Revokes").

Note

Unlike withholding the
[`SYSTEM_USER`](privileges-provided.md#priv_system-user) privilege, which
prevents an account from modifying system accounts but not
regular accounts, withholding `mysql` schema
privileges prevents an account from modifying system accounts
as well as regular accounts. This should not be an issue
because, as mentioned, direct grant-table modification is
discouraged.

Suppose that you want to create a user `u1` who
has all privileges on all schemas, except that
`u1` should be a regular user without the
ability to modify system accounts. Assuming that the
[`partial_revokes`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_partial_revokes) system variable
is enabled, configure `u1` as follows:

```sql
CREATE USER u1 IDENTIFIED BY 'password';

GRANT ALL ON *.* TO u1 WITH GRANT OPTION;
-- GRANT ALL includes SYSTEM_USER, so at this point
-- u1 can manipulate system or regular accounts

REVOKE SYSTEM_USER ON *.* FROM u1;
-- Revoking SYSTEM_USER makes u1 a regular user;
-- now u1 can use account-management statements
-- to manipulate only regular accounts

REVOKE ALL ON mysql.* FROM u1;
-- This partial revoke prevents u1 from directly
-- modifying grant tables to manipulate accounts
```

To prevent all `mysql` system schema access by
an account, revoke all its privileges on the
`mysql` schema, as just shown. It is also
possible to permit partial `mysql` schema
access, such as read-only access. The following example creates
an account that has `SELECT`,
`INSERT`, `UPDATE`, and
`DELETE` privileges globally for all schemas,
but only `SELECT` for the
`mysql` schema:

```sql
CREATE USER u2 IDENTIFIED BY 'password';
GRANT SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE ON *.* TO u2;
REVOKE INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE ON mysql.* FROM u2;
```

Another possibility is to revoke all `mysql`
schema privileges but grant access to specific
`mysql` tables or columns. This can be done
even with a partial revoke on `mysql`. The
following statements enable read-only access to
`u1` within the `mysql`
schema, but only for the `db` table and the
`Host` and `User` columns of
the `user` table:

```sql
CREATE USER u3 IDENTIFIED BY 'password';
GRANT ALL ON *.* TO u3;
REVOKE ALL ON mysql.* FROM u3;
GRANT SELECT ON mysql.db TO u3;
GRANT SELECT(Host,User) ON mysql.user TO u3;
```
