#### 19.2.1.1 Advantages and Disadvantages of Statement-Based and Row-Based Replication

Each binary logging format has advantages and disadvantages. For
most users, the mixed replication format should provide the best
combination of data integrity and performance. If, however, you
want to take advantage of the features specific to the
statement-based or row-based replication format when performing
certain tasks, you can use the information in this section,
which provides a summary of their relative advantages and
disadvantages, to determine which is best for your needs.

- [Advantages
  of statement-based replication](replication-sbr-rbr.md#replication-sbr-rbr-sbr-advantages "Advantages of statement-based replication")
- [Disadvantages
  of statement-based replication](replication-sbr-rbr.md#replication-sbr-rbr-sbr-disadvantages "Disadvantages of statement-based replication")
- [Advantages
  of row-based replication](replication-sbr-rbr.md#replication-sbr-rbr-rbr-advantages "Advantages of row-based replication")
- [Disadvantages
  of row-based replication](replication-sbr-rbr.md#replication-sbr-rbr-rbr-disadvantages "Disadvantages of row-based replication")

##### Advantages of statement-based replication

- Proven technology.
- Less data written to log files. When updates or deletes
  affect many rows, this results in *much*
  less storage space required for log files. This also means
  that taking and restoring from backups can be accomplished
  more quickly.
- Log files contain all statements that made any changes, so
  they can be used to audit the database.

##### Disadvantages of statement-based replication

- **Statements that are unsafe for SBR.**
  Not all statements which modify data (such as
  [`INSERT`](insert.md "15.2.7 INSERT Statement")
  [`DELETE`](delete.md "15.2.2 DELETE Statement"),
  [`UPDATE`](update.md "15.2.17 UPDATE Statement"), and
  [`REPLACE`](replace.md "15.2.12 REPLACE Statement") statements) can be
  replicated using statement-based replication. Any
  nondeterministic behavior is difficult to replicate when
  using statement-based replication. Examples of such Data
  Modification Language (DML) statements include the
  following:

  - A statement that depends on a loadable function or
    stored program that is nondeterministic, since the value
    returned by such a function or stored program depends
    on factors other than the parameters supplied to it.
    (Row-based replication, however, simply replicates the
    value returned by the function or stored program, so its
    effect on table rows and data is the same on both the
    source and replica.) See
    [Section 19.5.1.16, “Replication of Invoked Features”](replication-features-invoked.md "19.5.1.16 Replication of Invoked Features"), for more
    information.
  - [`DELETE`](delete.md "15.2.2 DELETE Statement") and
    [`UPDATE`](update.md "15.2.17 UPDATE Statement") statements that
    use a `LIMIT` clause without an
    `ORDER BY` are nondeterministic. See
    [Section 19.5.1.18, “Replication and LIMIT”](replication-features-limit.md "19.5.1.18 Replication and LIMIT").
  - Locking read statements
    ([`SELECT ... FOR
    UPDATE`](select.md "15.2.13 SELECT Statement") and
    [`SELECT ... FOR
    SHARE`](select.md "15.2.13 SELECT Statement")) that use `NOWAIT` or
    `SKIP LOCKED` options. See
    [Locking Read Concurrency with NOWAIT and SKIP LOCKED](innodb-locking-reads.md#innodb-locking-reads-nowait-skip-locked "Locking Read Concurrency with NOWAIT and SKIP LOCKED").
  - Deterministic loadable functions must be applied on the
    replicas.
  - Statements using any of the following functions cannot
    be replicated properly using statement-based
    replication:

    - [`LOAD_FILE()`](string-functions.md#function_load-file)
    - [`UUID()`](miscellaneous-functions.md#function_uuid),
      [`UUID_SHORT()`](miscellaneous-functions.md#function_uuid-short)
    - [`USER()`](information-functions.md#function_user)
    - [`FOUND_ROWS()`](information-functions.md#function_found-rows)
    - [`SYSDATE()`](date-and-time-functions.md#function_sysdate) (unless
      both the source and the replica are started with the
      [`--sysdate-is-now`](server-options.md#option_mysqld_sysdate-is-now)
      option)
    - [`GET_LOCK()`](locking-functions.md#function_get-lock)
    - [`IS_FREE_LOCK()`](locking-functions.md#function_is-free-lock)
    - [`IS_USED_LOCK()`](locking-functions.md#function_is-used-lock)
    - [`MASTER_POS_WAIT()`](replication-functions-synchronization.md#function_master-pos-wait)
    - [`RAND()`](mathematical-functions.md#function_rand)
    - [`RELEASE_LOCK()`](locking-functions.md#function_release-lock)
    - [`SOURCE_POS_WAIT()`](replication-functions-synchronization.md#function_source-pos-wait)
    - [`SLEEP()`](miscellaneous-functions.md#function_sleep)
    - [`VERSION()`](information-functions.md#function_version)

    However, all other functions are replicated correctly
    using statement-based replication, including
    [`NOW()`](date-and-time-functions.md#function_now) and so forth.

    For more information, see
    [Section 19.5.1.14, “Replication and System Functions”](replication-features-functions.md "19.5.1.14 Replication and System Functions").

  Statements that cannot be replicated correctly using
  statement-based replication are logged with a warning like
  the one shown here:

  ```none
  [Warning] Statement is not safe to log in statement format.
  ```

  A similar warning is also issued to the client in such
  cases. The client can display it using
  [`SHOW WARNINGS`](show-warnings.md "15.7.7.42 SHOW WARNINGS Statement").
- [`INSERT ...
  SELECT`](insert-select.md "15.2.7.1 INSERT ... SELECT Statement") requires a greater number of row-level
  locks than with row-based replication.
- [`UPDATE`](update.md "15.2.17 UPDATE Statement") statements that
  require a table scan (because no index is used in the
  `WHERE` clause) must lock a greater number
  of rows than with row-based replication.
- For [`InnoDB`](innodb-storage-engine.md "Chapter 17 The InnoDB Storage Engine"): An
  [`INSERT`](insert.md "15.2.7 INSERT Statement") statement that uses
  `AUTO_INCREMENT` blocks other
  nonconflicting [`INSERT`](insert.md "15.2.7 INSERT Statement")
  statements.
- For complex statements, the statement must be evaluated and
  executed on the replica before the rows are updated or
  inserted. With row-based replication, the replica only has
  to modify the affected rows, not execute the full statement.
- If there is an error in evaluation on the replica,
  particularly when executing complex statements,
  statement-based replication may slowly increase the margin
  of error across the affected rows over time. See
  [Section 19.5.1.29, “Replica Errors During Replication”](replication-features-errors.md "19.5.1.29 Replica Errors During Replication").
- Stored functions execute with the same
  [`NOW()`](date-and-time-functions.md#function_now) value as the calling
  statement. However, this is not true of stored procedures.
- Table definitions must be (nearly) identical on source and
  replica. See
  [Section 19.5.1.9, “Replication with Differing Table Definitions on Source and Replica”](replication-features-differing-tables.md "19.5.1.9 Replication with Differing Table Definitions on Source and Replica"), for
  more information.
- As of MySQL 8.0.22, DML operations that read data from MySQL
  grant tables (through a join list or subquery) but do not
  modify them are performed as non-locking reads on the MySQL
  grant tables and are therefore not safe for statement-based
  replication. For more information, see
  [Grant Table Concurrency](grant-tables.md#grant-tables-concurrency "Grant Table Concurrency").

##### Advantages of row-based replication

- All changes can be replicated. This is the safest form of
  replication.

  Note

  Statements that update the information in the
  `mysql` system schema, such as
  [`GRANT`](grant.md "15.7.1.6 GRANT Statement"),
  [`REVOKE`](revoke.md "15.7.1.8 REVOKE Statement") and the manipulation
  of triggers, stored routines (including stored
  procedures), and views, are all replicated to replicas
  using statement-based replication.

  For statements such as
  [`CREATE TABLE
  ... SELECT`](create-table.md "15.1.20 CREATE TABLE Statement"), a `CREATE`
  statement is generated from the table definition and
  replicated using statement-based format, while the row
  insertions are replicated using row-based format.
- Fewer row locks are required on the source, which thus
  achieves higher concurrency, for the following types of
  statements:

  - [`INSERT
    ... SELECT`](insert-select.md "15.2.7.1 INSERT ... SELECT Statement")
  - [`INSERT`](insert.md "15.2.7 INSERT Statement") statements with
    `AUTO_INCREMENT`
  - [`UPDATE`](update.md "15.2.17 UPDATE Statement") or
    [`DELETE`](delete.md "15.2.2 DELETE Statement") statements with
    `WHERE` clauses that do not use keys or
    do not change most of the examined rows.
- Fewer row locks are required on the replica for any
  [`INSERT`](insert.md "15.2.7 INSERT Statement"),
  [`UPDATE`](update.md "15.2.17 UPDATE Statement"), or
  [`DELETE`](delete.md "15.2.2 DELETE Statement") statement.

##### Disadvantages of row-based replication

- RBR can generate more data that must be logged. To replicate
  a DML statement (such as an
  [`UPDATE`](update.md "15.2.17 UPDATE Statement") or
  [`DELETE`](delete.md "15.2.2 DELETE Statement") statement),
  statement-based replication writes only the statement to the
  binary log. By contrast, row-based replication writes each
  changed row to the binary log. If the statement changes many
  rows, row-based replication may write significantly more
  data to the binary log; this is true even for statements
  that are rolled back. This also means that making and
  restoring a backup can require more time. In addition, the
  binary log is locked for a longer time to write the data,
  which may cause concurrency problems. Use
  [`binlog_row_image=minimal`](replication-options-binary-log.md#sysvar_binlog_row_image) to
  reduce the disadvantage considerably.
- Deterministic loadable functions that generate large
  [`BLOB`](blob.md "13.3.4 The BLOB and TEXT Types") values take longer to
  replicate with row-based replication than with
  statement-based replication. This is because the
  [`BLOB`](blob.md "13.3.4 The BLOB and TEXT Types") column value is logged,
  rather than the statement generating the data.
- You cannot see on the replica what statements were received
  from the source and executed. However, you can see what data
  was changed using [**mysqlbinlog**](mysqlbinlog.md "6.6.9 mysqlbinlog — Utility for Processing Binary Log Files") with the
  options
  [`--base64-output=DECODE-ROWS`](mysqlbinlog.md#option_mysqlbinlog_base64-output)
  and [`--verbose`](mysqlbinlog.md#option_mysqlbinlog_verbose).

  Alternatively, use the
  [`binlog_rows_query_log_events`](replication-options-binary-log.md#sysvar_binlog_rows_query_log_events)
  variable, which if enabled adds a
  `Rows_query` event with the statement to
  [**mysqlbinlog**](mysqlbinlog.md "6.6.9 mysqlbinlog — Utility for Processing Binary Log Files") output when the
  `-vv` option is used.
- For tables using the [`MyISAM`](myisam-storage-engine.md "18.2 The MyISAM Storage Engine")
  storage engine, a stronger lock is required on the replica
  for [`INSERT`](insert.md "15.2.7 INSERT Statement") statements when
  applying them as row-based events to the binary log than
  when applying them as statements. This means that concurrent
  inserts on [`MyISAM`](myisam-storage-engine.md "18.2 The MyISAM Storage Engine") tables are
  not supported when using row-based replication.
