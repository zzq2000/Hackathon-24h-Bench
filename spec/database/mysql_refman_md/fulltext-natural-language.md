### 14.9.1 Natural Language Full-Text Searches

By default or with the `IN NATURAL LANGUAGE
MODE` modifier, the
[`MATCH()`](fulltext-search.md#function_match) function performs a
natural language search for a string against a
text collection. A
collection is a set of one or more columns included in a
`FULLTEXT` index. The search string is given as
the argument to `AGAINST()`. For each row in
the table, [`MATCH()`](fulltext-search.md#function_match) returns a
relevance value; that is, a similarity measure between the
search string and the text in that row in the columns named in
the [`MATCH()`](fulltext-search.md#function_match) list.

```sql
mysql> CREATE TABLE articles (
    ->   id INT UNSIGNED AUTO_INCREMENT NOT NULL PRIMARY KEY,
    ->   title VARCHAR(200),
    ->   body TEXT,
    ->   FULLTEXT (title,body)
    -> ) ENGINE=InnoDB;
Query OK, 0 rows affected (0.08 sec)

mysql> INSERT INTO articles (title,body) VALUES
    ->   ('MySQL Tutorial','DBMS stands for DataBase ...'),
    ->   ('How To Use MySQL Well','After you went through a ...'),
    ->   ('Optimizing MySQL','In this tutorial, we show ...'),
    ->   ('1001 MySQL Tricks','1. Never run mysqld as root. 2. ...'),
    ->   ('MySQL vs. YourSQL','In the following database comparison ...'),
    ->   ('MySQL Security','When configured properly, MySQL ...');
Query OK, 6 rows affected (0.01 sec)
Records: 6  Duplicates: 0  Warnings: 0

mysql> SELECT * FROM articles
    -> WHERE MATCH (title,body)
    -> AGAINST ('database' IN NATURAL LANGUAGE MODE);
+----+-------------------+------------------------------------------+
| id | title             | body                                     |
+----+-------------------+------------------------------------------+
|  1 | MySQL Tutorial    | DBMS stands for DataBase ...             |
|  5 | MySQL vs. YourSQL | In the following database comparison ... |
+----+-------------------+------------------------------------------+
2 rows in set (0.00 sec)
```

By default, the search is performed in case-insensitive fashion.
To perform a case-sensitive full-text search, use a
case-sensitive or binary collation for the indexed columns. For
example, a column that uses the `utf8mb4`
character set of can be assigned a collation of
`utf8mb4_0900_as_cs` or
`utf8mb4_bin` to make it case-sensitive for
full-text searches.

When [`MATCH()`](fulltext-search.md#function_match) is used in a
`WHERE` clause, as in the example shown
earlier, the rows returned are automatically sorted with the
highest relevance first as long as the following conditions are
met:

- There must be no explicit `ORDER BY`
  clause.
- The search must be performed using a full-text index scan
  rather than a table scan.
- If the query joins tables, the full-text index scan must be
  the leftmost non-constant table in the join.

Given the conditions just listed, it is usually less effort to
specify using `ORDER BY` an explicit sort order
when one is necessary or desired.

Relevance values are nonnegative floating-point numbers. Zero
relevance means no similarity. Relevance is computed based on
the number of words in the row (document), the number of unique
words in the row, the total number of words in the collection,
and the number of rows that contain a particular word.

Note

The term “document” may be used interchangeably
with the term “row”, and both terms refer to the
indexed part of the row. The term “collection”
refers to the indexed columns and encompasses all rows.

To simply count matches, you could use a query like this:

```sql
mysql> SELECT COUNT(*) FROM articles
    -> WHERE MATCH (title,body)
    -> AGAINST ('database' IN NATURAL LANGUAGE MODE);
+----------+
| COUNT(*) |
+----------+
|        2 |
+----------+
1 row in set (0.00 sec)
```

You might find it quicker to rewrite the query as follows:

```sql
mysql> SELECT
    -> COUNT(IF(MATCH (title,body) AGAINST ('database' IN NATURAL LANGUAGE MODE), 1, NULL))
    -> AS count
    -> FROM articles;
+-------+
| count |
+-------+
|     2 |
+-------+
1 row in set (0.03 sec)
```

The first query does some extra work (sorting the results by
relevance) but also can use an index lookup based on the
`WHERE` clause. The index lookup might make the
first query faster if the search matches few rows. The second
query performs a full table scan, which might be faster than the
index lookup if the search term was present in most rows.

For natural-language full-text searches, the columns named in
the [`MATCH()`](fulltext-search.md#function_match) function must be the
same columns included in some `FULLTEXT` index
in your table. For the preceding query, note that the columns
named in the [`MATCH()`](fulltext-search.md#function_match) function
(`title` and `body`) are the
same as those named in the definition of the
`article` table's `FULLTEXT`
index. To search the `title` or
`body` separately, you would create separate
`FULLTEXT` indexes for each column.

You can also perform a boolean search or a search with query
expansion. These search types are described in
[Section 14.9.2, “Boolean Full-Text Searches”](fulltext-boolean.md "14.9.2 Boolean Full-Text Searches"), and
[Section 14.9.3, “Full-Text Searches with Query Expansion”](fulltext-query-expansion.md "14.9.3 Full-Text Searches with Query Expansion").

A full-text search that uses an index can name columns only from
a single table in the [`MATCH()`](fulltext-search.md#function_match)
clause because an index cannot span multiple tables. For
`MyISAM` tables, a boolean search can be done
in the absence of an index (albeit more slowly), in which case
it is possible to name columns from multiple tables.

The preceding example is a basic illustration that shows how to
use the [`MATCH()`](fulltext-search.md#function_match) function where
rows are returned in order of decreasing relevance. The next
example shows how to retrieve the relevance values explicitly.
Returned rows are not ordered because the
[`SELECT`](select.md "15.2.13 SELECT Statement") statement includes neither
`WHERE` nor `ORDER BY`
clauses:

```sql
mysql> SELECT id, MATCH (title,body)
    -> AGAINST ('Tutorial' IN NATURAL LANGUAGE MODE) AS score
    -> FROM articles;
+----+---------------------+
| id | score               |
+----+---------------------+
|  1 | 0.22764469683170319 |
|  2 |                   0 |
|  3 | 0.22764469683170319 |
|  4 |                   0 |
|  5 |                   0 |
|  6 |                   0 |
+----+---------------------+
6 rows in set (0.00 sec)
```

The following example is more complex. The query returns the
relevance values and it also sorts the rows in order of
decreasing relevance. To achieve this result, specify
[`MATCH()`](fulltext-search.md#function_match) twice: once in the
[`SELECT`](select.md "15.2.13 SELECT Statement") list and once in the
`WHERE` clause. This causes no additional
overhead, because the MySQL optimizer notices that the two
[`MATCH()`](fulltext-search.md#function_match) calls are identical and
invokes the full-text search code only once.

```sql
mysql> SELECT id, body, MATCH (title,body)
    ->   AGAINST ('Security implications of running MySQL as root'
    ->   IN NATURAL LANGUAGE MODE) AS score
    -> FROM articles
    ->   WHERE MATCH (title,body)
    ->   AGAINST('Security implications of running MySQL as root'
    ->   IN NATURAL LANGUAGE MODE);
+----+-------------------------------------+-----------------+
| id | body                                | score           |
+----+-------------------------------------+-----------------+
|  4 | 1. Never run mysqld as root. 2. ... | 1.5219271183014 |
|  6 | When configured properly, MySQL ... | 1.3114095926285 |
+----+-------------------------------------+-----------------+
2 rows in set (0.00 sec)
```

A phrase that is enclosed within double quote
(`"`) characters matches only rows that contain
the phrase *literally, as it was typed*. The
full-text engine splits the phrase into words and performs a
search in the `FULLTEXT` index for the words.
Nonword characters need not be matched exactly: Phrase searching
requires only that matches contain exactly the same words as the
phrase and in the same order. For example, `"test
phrase"` matches `"test, phrase"`. If
the phrase contains no words that are in the index, the result
is empty. For example, if all words are either stopwords or
shorter than the minimum length of indexed words, the result is
empty.

The MySQL `FULLTEXT` implementation regards any
sequence of true word characters (letters, digits, and
underscores) as a word. That sequence may also contain
apostrophes (`'`), but not more than one in a
row. This means that `aaa'bbb` is regarded as
one word, but `aaa''bbb` is regarded as two
words. Apostrophes at the beginning or the end of a word are
stripped by the `FULLTEXT` parser;
`'aaa'bbb'` would be parsed as
`aaa'bbb`.

The built-in `FULLTEXT` parser determines where
words start and end by looking for certain delimiter characters;
for example,  (space),
`,` (comma), and `.` (period).
If words are not separated by delimiters (as in, for example,
Chinese), the built-in `FULLTEXT` parser cannot
determine where a word begins or ends. To be able to add words
or other indexed terms in such languages to a
`FULLTEXT` index that uses the built-in
`FULLTEXT` parser, you must preprocess them so
that they are separated by some arbitrary delimiter.
Alternatively, you can create `FULLTEXT`
indexes using the ngram parser plugin (for Chinese, Japanese, or
Korean) or the MeCab parser plugin (for Japanese).

It is possible to write a plugin that replaces the built-in
full-text parser. For details, see [The MySQL Plugin API](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/extending-mysql/8.0/en/plugin-api.html).
For example parser plugin source code, see the
`plugin/fulltext` directory of a MySQL source
distribution.

Some words are ignored in full-text searches:

- Any word that is too short is ignored. The default minimum
  length of words that are found by full-text searches is
  three characters for `InnoDB` search
  indexes, or four characters for `MyISAM`.
  You can control the cutoff by setting a configuration option
  before creating the index:
  [`innodb_ft_min_token_size`](innodb-parameters.md#sysvar_innodb_ft_min_token_size)
  configuration option for `InnoDB` search
  indexes, or [`ft_min_word_len`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_ft_min_word_len)
  for `MyISAM`.

  Note

  This behavior does not apply to
  `FULLTEXT` indexes that use the ngram
  parser. For the ngram parser, token length is defined by
  the [`ngram_token_size`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_ngram_token_size)
  option.
- Words in the stopword list are ignored. A stopword is a word
  such as “the” or “some” that is so
  common that it is considered to have zero semantic value.
  There is a built-in stopword list, but it can be overridden
  by a user-defined list. The stopword lists and related
  configuration options are different for
  `InnoDB` search indexes and
  `MyISAM` ones. Stopword processing is
  controlled by the configuration options
  [`innodb_ft_enable_stopword`](innodb-parameters.md#sysvar_innodb_ft_enable_stopword),
  [`innodb_ft_server_stopword_table`](innodb-parameters.md#sysvar_innodb_ft_server_stopword_table),
  and
  [`innodb_ft_user_stopword_table`](innodb-parameters.md#sysvar_innodb_ft_user_stopword_table)
  for `InnoDB` search indexes, and
  [`ft_stopword_file`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_ft_stopword_file) for
  `MyISAM` ones.

See [Section 14.9.4, “Full-Text Stopwords”](fulltext-stopwords.md "14.9.4 Full-Text Stopwords") to view default
stopword lists and how to change them. The default minimum word
length can be changed as described in
[Section 14.9.6, “Fine-Tuning MySQL Full-Text Search”](fulltext-fine-tuning.md "14.9.6 Fine-Tuning MySQL Full-Text Search").

Every correct word in the collection and in the query is
weighted according to its significance in the collection or
query. Thus, a word that is present in many documents has a
lower weight, because it has lower semantic value in this
particular collection. Conversely, if the word is rare, it
receives a higher weight. The weights of the words are combined
to compute the relevance of the row. This technique works best
with large collections.

MyISAM Limitation

For very small tables, word distribution does not adequately
reflect their semantic value, and this model may sometimes
produce bizarre results for search indexes on
`MyISAM` tables. For example, although the
word “MySQL” is present in every row of the
`articles` table shown earlier, a search for
the word in a `MyISAM` search index produces
no results:

```sql
mysql> SELECT * FROM articles
    -> WHERE MATCH (title,body)
    -> AGAINST ('MySQL' IN NATURAL LANGUAGE MODE);
Empty set (0.00 sec)
```

The search result is empty because the word
“MySQL” is present in at least 50% of the rows,
and so is effectively treated as a stopword. This filtering
technique is more suitable for large data sets, where you
might not want the result set to return every second row from
a 1GB table, than for small data sets where it might cause
poor results for popular terms.

The 50% threshold can surprise you when you first try
full-text searching to see how it works, and makes
`InnoDB` tables more suited to
experimentation with full-text searches. If you create a
`MyISAM` table and insert only one or two
rows of text into it, every word in the text occurs in at
least 50% of the rows. As a result, no search returns any
results until the table contains more rows. Users who need to
bypass the 50% limitation can build search indexes on
`InnoDB` tables, or use the boolean search
mode explained in [Section 14.9.2, “Boolean Full-Text Searches”](fulltext-boolean.md "14.9.2 Boolean Full-Text Searches").
