### 10.5.1 Optimizing Storage Layout for InnoDB Tables

- Once your data reaches a stable size, or a growing table has
  increased by tens or some hundreds of megabytes, consider
  using the `OPTIMIZE TABLE` statement to
  reorganize the table and compact any wasted space. The
  reorganized tables require less disk I/O to perform full
  table scans. This is a straightforward technique that can
  improve performance when other techniques such as improving
  index usage or tuning application code are not practical.

  `OPTIMIZE TABLE` copies the data part of
  the table and rebuilds the indexes. The benefits come from
  improved packing of data within indexes, and reduced
  fragmentation within the tablespaces and on disk. The
  benefits vary depending on the data in each table. You may
  find that there are significant gains for some and not for
  others, or that the gains decrease over time until you next
  optimize the table. This operation can be slow if the table
  is large or if the indexes being rebuilt do not fit into the
  buffer pool. The first run after adding a lot of data to a
  table is often much slower than later runs.
- In `InnoDB`, having a long `PRIMARY
  KEY` (either a single column with a lengthy value,
  or several columns that form a long composite value) wastes
  a lot of disk space. The primary key value for a row is
  duplicated in all the secondary index records that point to
  the same row. (See [Section 17.6.2.1, “Clustered and Secondary Indexes”](innodb-index-types.md "17.6.2.1 Clustered and Secondary Indexes").)
  Create an `AUTO_INCREMENT` column as the
  primary key if your primary key is long, or index a prefix
  of a long `VARCHAR` column instead of the
  entire column.
- Use the [`VARCHAR`](char.md "13.3.2 The CHAR and VARCHAR Types") data type
  instead of [`CHAR`](char.md "13.3.2 The CHAR and VARCHAR Types") to store
  variable-length strings or for columns with many
  `NULL` values. A
  [`CHAR(N)`](char.md "13.3.2 The CHAR and VARCHAR Types")
  column always takes *`N`* characters
  to store data, even if the string is shorter or its value is
  `NULL`. Smaller tables fit better in the
  buffer pool and reduce disk I/O.

  When using `COMPACT` row format and
  variable-length character sets, such as
  `utf8mb4` or `sjis`,
  [`CHAR(N)`](char.md "13.3.2 The CHAR and VARCHAR Types")
  columns occupy a variable amount of space, but still at
  least *`N`* bytes.
- For tables that are big, or contain lots of repetitive text
  or numeric data, consider using
  `COMPRESSED` row format. Less disk I/O is
  required to bring data into the buffer pool, or to perform
  full table scans. Before making a permanent decision,
  measure the amount of compression you can achieve by using
  `COMPRESSED` versus
  `COMPACT` row format.
