#### 22.3.3.3 Find Documents

You can use the `find()` method to query for
and return documents from a collection in a schema. MySQL Shell
provides additional methods to use with the
`find()` method to filter and sort the returned
documents.

MySQL provides the following operators to specify search
conditions: `OR` (`||`),
`AND` (`&&`),
`XOR`, `IS`,
`NOT`, `BETWEEN`,
`IN`, `LIKE`,
`!=`, `<>`,
`>`, `>=`,
`<`, `<=`,
`&`, `|`,
`<<`, `>>`,
`+`, `-`,
`*`, `/`,
`~`, and `%`.

##### Find All Documents in a Collection

To return all documents in a collection, use the
`find()` method without specifying search
conditions. For example, the following operation returns all
documents in the `countryinfo` collection.

```mysqlsh
mysql-js> db.countryinfo.find()
[
     {
          "GNP": 828,
          "Code:": "ABW",
          "Name": "Aruba",
          "IndepYear": null,
          "geography": {
              "Continent": "North America",
              "Region": "Caribbean",
              "SurfaceArea": 193
          },
          "government": {
              "GovernmentForm": "Nonmetropolitan Territory of The Netherlands",
              "HeadOfState": "Beatrix"
          }
          "demographics": {
              "LifeExpectancy": 78.4000015258789,
              "Population": 103000
          },
          ...
      }
 ]
240 documents in set (0.00 sec)
```

The method produces results that contain operational
information in addition to all documents in the collection.

An empty set (no matching documents) returns the following
information:

```
Empty set (0.00 sec)
```

##### Filter Searches

You can include search conditions with the
`find()` method. The syntax for expressions
that form a search condition is the same as that of
traditional MySQL [Chapter 14, *Functions and Operators*](functions.md "Chapter 14 Functions and Operators"). You must
enclose all expressions in quotes. For the sake of brevity,
some of the examples do not display output.

A simple search condition could consist of the
`Name` field and a value we know is in a
document. The following example returns a single document:

```mysqlsh
mysql-js> db.countryinfo.find("Name = 'Australia'")
[
    {
        "GNP": 351182,
        "Code:": "AUS",
        "Name": "Australia",
        "IndepYear": 1901,
        "geography": {
            "Continent": "Oceania",
            "Region": "Australia and New Zealand",
            "SurfaceArea": 7741220
        },
        "government": {
            "GovernmentForm": "Constitutional Monarchy, Federation",
            "HeadOfState": "Elisabeth II"
        }
        "demographics": {
            "LifeExpectancy": 79.80000305175781,
            "Population": 18886000
        },
    }
]
```

The following example searches for all countries that have a
GNP higher than $500 billion. The
`countryinfo` collection measures GNP in
units of million.

```mysqlsh
mysql-js> db.countryinfo.find("GNP > 500000")
...[output removed]
10 documents in set (0.00 sec)
```

The Population field in the following query is embedded within
the demographics object. To access the embedded field, use a
period between demographics and Population to identify the
relationship. Document and field names are case-sensitive.

```mysqlsh
mysql-js> db.countryinfo.find("GNP > 500000 and demographics.Population < 100000000")
...[output removed]
6 documents in set (0.00 sec)
```

Arithmetic operators in the following expression are used to
query for countries with a GNP per capita higher than $30000.
Search conditions can include arithmetic operators and most
MySQL functions.

Note

Seven documents in the `countryinfo`
collection have a population value of zero. Therefore
warning messages appear at the end of the output.

```mysqlsh
mysql-js> db.countryinfo.find("GNP*1000000/demographics.Population > 30000")
...[output removed]
9 documents in set, 7 warnings (0.00 sec)
Warning (Code 1365): Division by 0
Warning (Code 1365): Division by 0
Warning (Code 1365): Division by 0
Warning (Code 1365): Division by 0
Warning (Code 1365): Division by 0
Warning (Code 1365): Division by 0
Warning (Code 1365): Division by 0
```

You can separate a value from the search condition by using
the `bind()` method. For example, instead of
specifying a hard-coded country name as the condition,
substitute a named placeholder consisting of a colon followed
by a name that begins with a letter, such as
*country*. Then use the
`bind(placeholder,
value)` method as follows:

```mysqlsh
mysql-js> db.countryinfo.find("Name = :country").bind("country", "Italy")
{
    "GNP": 1161755,
    "_id": "00005de917d8000000000000006a",
    "Code": "ITA",
    "Name": "Italy",
    "Airports": [],
    "IndepYear": 1861,
    "geography": {
        "Region": "Southern Europe",
        "Continent": "Europe",
        "SurfaceArea": 301316
    },
    "government": {
        "HeadOfState": "Carlo Azeglio Ciampi",
        "GovernmentForm": "Republic"
    },
    "demographics": {
        "Population": 57680000,
        "LifeExpectancy": 79
    }
}
1 document in set (0.01 sec)
```

Tip

Within a program, binding enables you to specify
placeholders in your expressions, which are filled in with
values before execution and can benefit from automatic
escaping, as appropriate.

Always use binding to sanitize input. Avoid introducing
values in queries using string concatenation, which can
produce invalid input and, in some cases, can cause security
issues.

You can use placeholders and the `bind()`
method to create saved searches which you can then call with
different values. For example to create a saved search for a
country:

```mysqlsh
mysql-js> var myFind = db.countryinfo.find("Name = :country")
mysql-js> myFind.bind('country', 'France')
{
    "GNP": 1424285,
    "_id": "00005de917d80000000000000048",
    "Code": "FRA",
    "Name": "France",
    "IndepYear": 843,
    "geography": {
        "Region": "Western Europe",
        "Continent": "Europe",
        "SurfaceArea": 551500
    },
    "government": {
        "HeadOfState": "Jacques Chirac",
        "GovernmentForm": "Republic"
    },
    "demographics": {
        "Population": 59225700,
        "LifeExpectancy": 78.80000305175781
    }
}
1 document in set (0.0028 sec)

mysql-js> myFind.bind('country', 'Germany')
{
    "GNP": 2133367,
    "_id": "00005de917d80000000000000038",
    "Code": "DEU",
    "Name": "Germany",
    "IndepYear": 1955,
    "geography": {
        "Region": "Western Europe",
        "Continent": "Europe",
        "SurfaceArea": 357022
    },
    "government": {
        "HeadOfState": "Johannes Rau",
        "GovernmentForm": "Federal Republic"
    },
    "demographics": {
        "Population": 82164700,
        "LifeExpectancy": 77.4000015258789
    }
}

1 document in set (0.0026 sec)
```

##### Project Results

You can return specific fields of a document, instead of
returning all the fields. The following example returns the
GNP and Name fields of all documents in the
`countryinfo` collection matching the search
conditions.

Use the `fields()` method to pass the list of
fields to return.

```mysqlsh
mysql-js> db.countryinfo.find("GNP > 5000000").fields(["GNP", "Name"])
[
    {
        "GNP": 8510700,
        "Name": "United States"
    }
]
1 document in set (0.00 sec)
```

In addition, you can alter the returned
documents—adding, renaming, nesting and even computing
new field values—with an expression that describes the
document to return. For example, alter the names of the fields
with the following expression to return only two documents.

```mysqlsh
mysql-js> db.countryinfo.find().fields(
mysqlx.expr('{"Name": upper(Name), "GNPPerCapita": GNP*1000000/demographics.Population}')).limit(2)
{
    "Name": "ARUBA",
    "GNPPerCapita": 8038.834951456311
}
{
    "Name": "AFGHANISTAN",
    "GNPPerCapita": 263.0281690140845
}
```

##### Limit, Sort, and Skip Results

You can apply the `limit()`,
`sort()`, and `skip()`
methods to manage the number and order of documents returned
by the `find()` method.

To specify the number of documents included in a result set,
append the `limit()` method with a value to
the `find()` method. The following query
returns the first five documents in the
`countryinfo` collection.

```mysqlsh
mysql-js> db.countryinfo.find().limit(5)
... [output removed]
5 documents in set (0.00 sec)
```

To specify an order for the results, append the
`sort()` method to the
`find()` method. Pass to the
`sort()` method a list of one or more fields
to sort by and, optionally, the descending
(`desc`) or ascending
(`asc`) attribute as appropriate. Ascending
order is the default order type.

For example, the following query sorts all documents by the
IndepYear field and then returns the first eight documents in
descending order.

```mysqlsh
mysql-js> db.countryinfo.find().sort(["IndepYear desc"]).limit(8)
... [output removed]
8 documents in set (0.00 sec)
```

By default, the `limit()` method starts from
the first document in the collection. You can use the
`skip()` method to change the starting
document. For example, to ignore the first document and return
the next eight documents matching the condition, pass to the
`skip()` method a value of 1.

```mysqlsh
mysql-js> db.countryinfo.find().sort(["IndepYear desc"]).limit(8).skip(1)
... [output removed]
8 documents in set (0.00 sec)
```
