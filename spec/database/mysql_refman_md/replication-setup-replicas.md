#### 19.1.2.6 Setting Up Replicas

The following sections describe how to set up replicas. Before
you proceed, ensure that you have:

- Configured the source with the necessary configuration
  properties. See
  [Section 19.1.2.1, “Setting the Replication Source Configuration”](replication-howto-masterbaseconfig.md "19.1.2.1 Setting the Replication Source Configuration").
- Obtained the source status information, or a copy of the
  source's binary log index file made during a shutdown for
  the data snapshot. See
  [Section 19.1.2.4, “Obtaining the Replication Source Binary Log Coordinates”](replication-howto-masterstatus.md "19.1.2.4 Obtaining the Replication Source Binary Log Coordinates").
- On the source, released the read lock:

  ```sql
  mysql> UNLOCK TABLES;
  ```
- On the replica, edited the MySQL configuration. See
  [Section 19.1.2.2, “Setting the Replica Configuration”](replication-howto-slavebaseconfig.md "19.1.2.2 Setting the Replica Configuration").

The next steps depend on whether you have existing data to
import to the replica or not. See
[Section 19.1.2.5, “Choosing a Method for Data Snapshots”](replication-snapshot-method.md "19.1.2.5 Choosing a Method for Data Snapshots") for more
information. Choose one of the following:

- If you do not have a snapshot of a database to import, see
  [Section 19.1.2.6.1, “Setting Up Replication with New Source and Replicas”](replication-setup-replicas.md#replication-howto-newservers "19.1.2.6.1 Setting Up Replication with New Source and Replicas").
- If you have a snapshot of a database to import, see
  [Section 19.1.2.6.2, “Setting Up Replication with Existing Data”](replication-setup-replicas.md#replication-howto-existingdata "19.1.2.6.2 Setting Up Replication with Existing Data").

##### 19.1.2.6.1 Setting Up Replication with New Source and Replicas

When there is no snapshot of a previous database to import,
configure the replica to start replication from the new
source.

To set up replication between a source and a new replica:

1. Start up the replica.
2. Execute a [`CHANGE REPLICATION SOURCE
   TO`](change-replication-source-to.md "15.4.2.3 CHANGE REPLICATION SOURCE TO Statement") | [`CHANGE MASTER
   TO`](change-master-to.md "15.4.2.1 CHANGE MASTER TO Statement") statement on the replica to set the source
   configuration. See
   [Section 19.1.2.7, “Setting the Source Configuration on the Replica”](replication-howto-slaveinit.md "19.1.2.7 Setting the Source Configuration on the Replica").

Perform these replica setup steps on each replica.

This method can also be used if you are setting up new servers
but have an existing dump of the databases from a different
server that you want to load into your replication
configuration. By loading the data into a new source, the data
is automatically replicated to the replicas.

If you are setting up a new replication environment using the
data from a different existing database server to create a new
source, run the dump file generated from that server on the
new source. The database updates are automatically propagated
to the replicas:

```terminal
$> mysql -h source < fulldb.dump
```

##### 19.1.2.6.2 Setting Up Replication with Existing Data

When setting up replication with existing data, transfer the
snapshot from the source to the replica before starting
replication. The process for importing data to the replica
depends on how you created the snapshot of data on the source.

Tip

To deploy multiple instances of MySQL, you can use [InnoDB Cluster](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/mysql-shell/8.0/en/mysql-innodb-cluster.html) which enables you to easily administer a group of MySQL server instances in [MySQL Shell](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/mysql-shell/8.0/en/). InnoDB Cluster wraps MySQL Group Replication in a programmatic environment that enables you easily deploy a cluster of MySQL instances to achieve high availability. In addition, InnoDB Cluster interfaces seamlessly with [MySQL Router](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/mysql-router/8.0/en/), which enables your applications to connect to the cluster without writing your own failover process. For similar use cases that do not require high availability, however, you can use [InnoDB ReplicaSet](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/mysql-shell/8.0/en/mysql-innodb-replicaset.html). Installation instructions for MySQL Shell can be found [here](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/mysql-shell/8.0/en/mysql-shell-install.html).

Note

If the replication source server or existing replica that
you are copying to create the new replica has any scheduled
events, ensure that these are disabled on the new replica
before you start it. If an event runs on the new replica
that has already run on the source, the duplicated operation
causes an error. The Event Scheduler is controlled by the
[`event_scheduler`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_event_scheduler) system
variable, which defaults to `ON` from MySQL
8.0, so events that are active on the original server run by
default when the new replica starts up. To stop all events
from running on the new replica, set the
[`event_scheduler`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_event_scheduler) system
variable to `OFF` or
`DISABLED` on the new replica.
Alternatively, you can use the [`ALTER
EVENT`](alter-event.md "15.1.3 ALTER EVENT Statement") statement to set individual events to
`DISABLE` or `DISABLE ON
SLAVE` to prevent them from running on the new
replica. You can list the events on a server using the
[`SHOW`](show.md "15.7.7 SHOW Statements") statement or the
Information Schema [`EVENTS`](information-schema-events-table.md "28.3.14 The INFORMATION_SCHEMA EVENTS Table")
table. For more information, see
[Section 19.5.1.16, “Replication of Invoked Features”](replication-features-invoked.md "19.5.1.16 Replication of Invoked Features").

As an alternative to creating a new replica in this way, MySQL
Server's clone plugin can be used to transfer all the data and
replication settings from an existing replica to a clone. For
instructions to use this method, see
[Section 7.6.7.7, “Cloning for Replication”](clone-plugin-replication.md "7.6.7.7 Cloning for Replication").

Follow this procedure to set up replication with existing
data:

1. If you used MySQL Server's clone plugin to create a clone
   from an existing replica (see
   [Section 7.6.7.7, “Cloning for Replication”](clone-plugin-replication.md "7.6.7.7 Cloning for Replication")), the data is
   already transferred. Otherwise, import the data to the
   replica using one of the following methods.

   1. If you used [**mysqldump**](mysqldump.md "6.5.4 mysqldump — A Database Backup Program"), start the
      replica server, ensuring that replication does not
      start by using the
      [`--skip-slave-start`](replication-options-replica.md#option_mysqld_skip-slave-start)
      option, or from MySQL 8.0.24, the
      [`skip_slave_start`](replication-options-replica.md#sysvar_skip_slave_start)
      system variable. Then import the dump file:

      ```terminal
      $> mysql < fulldb.dump
      ```
   2. If you created a snapshot using the raw data files,
      extract the data files into your replica's data
      directory. For example:

      ```terminal
      $> tar xvf dbdump.tar
      ```

      You may need to set permissions and ownership on the
      files so that the replica server can access and modify
      them. Then start the replica server, ensuring that
      replication does not start by using the
      [`--skip-slave-start`](replication-options-replica.md#option_mysqld_skip-slave-start)
      option, or from MySQL 8.0.24, the
      [`skip_slave_start`](replication-options-replica.md#sysvar_skip_slave_start)
      system variable.
2. Configure the replica with the replication coordinates
   from the source. This tells the replica the binary log
   file and position within the file where replication needs
   to start. Also, configure the replica with the login
   credentials and host name of the source. For more
   information on the [`CHANGE REPLICATION
   SOURCE TO`](change-replication-source-to.md "15.4.2.3 CHANGE REPLICATION SOURCE TO Statement") | [`CHANGE MASTER
   TO`](change-master-to.md "15.4.2.1 CHANGE MASTER TO Statement") statement required, see
   [Section 19.1.2.7, “Setting the Source Configuration on the Replica”](replication-howto-slaveinit.md "19.1.2.7 Setting the Source Configuration on the Replica").
3. Start the replication threads by issuing a
   [`START REPLICA`](start-replica.md "15.4.2.6 START REPLICA Statement") (or before
   MySQL 8.0.22, [`START SLAVE`](start-slave.md "15.4.2.7 START SLAVE Statement"))
   statement.

After you have performed this procedure, the replica connects
to the source and replicates any updates that have occurred on
the source since the snapshot was taken. Error messages are
issued to the replica's error log if it is not able to
replicate for any reason.

The replica uses information logged in its connection metadata
repository and applier metadata repository to keep track of
how much of the source's binary log it has processed.
From MySQL 8.0, by default, these repositories are tables
named `slave_master_info` and
`slave_relay_log_info` in the
`mysql` database. Do *not*
remove or edit these tables unless you know exactly what you
are doing and fully understand the implications. Even in that
case, it is preferred that you use the
[`CHANGE REPLICATION SOURCE TO`](change-replication-source-to.md "15.4.2.3 CHANGE REPLICATION SOURCE TO Statement") |
[`CHANGE MASTER TO`](change-master-to.md "15.4.2.1 CHANGE MASTER TO Statement") statement to
change replication parameters. The replica uses the values
specified in the statement to update the replication metadata
repositories automatically. See
[Section 19.2.4, “Relay Log and Replication Metadata Repositories”](replica-logs.md "19.2.4 Relay Log and Replication Metadata Repositories"), for more information.

Note

The contents of the replica's connection metadata repository
override some of the server options specified on the command
line or in `my.cnf`. See
[Section 19.1.6, “Replication and Binary Logging Options and Variables”](replication-options.md "19.1.6 Replication and Binary Logging Options and Variables"), for more details.

A single snapshot of the source suffices for multiple
replicas. To set up additional replicas, use the same source
snapshot and follow the replica portion of the procedure just
described.
