#### 15.7.4.6 UNINSTALL PLUGIN Statement

```sql
UNINSTALL PLUGIN plugin_name
```

This statement removes an installed server plugin.
[`UNINSTALL PLUGIN`](uninstall-plugin.md "15.7.4.6 UNINSTALL PLUGIN Statement") is the
complement of [`INSTALL PLUGIN`](install-plugin.md "15.7.4.4 INSTALL PLUGIN Statement"). It
requires the [`DELETE`](privileges-provided.md#priv_delete) privilege for
the `mysql.plugin` system table because it
removes the row from that table that registers the plugin.

*`plugin_name`* must be the name of some
plugin that is listed in the `mysql.plugin`
table. The server executes the plugin's deinitialization
function and removes the row for the plugin from the
`mysql.plugin` system table, so that subsequent
server restarts do not load and initialize the plugin.
[`UNINSTALL PLUGIN`](uninstall-plugin.md "15.7.4.6 UNINSTALL PLUGIN Statement") does not remove
the plugin's shared library file.

You cannot uninstall a plugin if any table that uses it is open.

Plugin removal has implications for the use of associated
tables. For example, if a full-text parser plugin is associated
with a `FULLTEXT` index on the table,
uninstalling the plugin makes the table unusable. Any attempt to
access the table results in an error. The table cannot even be
opened, so you cannot drop an index for which the plugin is
used. This means that uninstalling a plugin is something to do
with care unless you do not care about the table contents. If
you are uninstalling a plugin with no intention of reinstalling
it later and you care about the table contents, you should dump
the table with [**mysqldump**](mysqldump.md "6.5.4 mysqldump — A Database Backup Program") and remove the
`WITH PARSER` clause from the dumped
[`CREATE TABLE`](create-table.md "15.1.20 CREATE TABLE Statement") statement so that
you can reload the table later. If you do not care about the
table, [`DROP TABLE`](drop-table.md "15.1.32 DROP TABLE Statement") can be used
even if any plugins associated with the table are missing.
