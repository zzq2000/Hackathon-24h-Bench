#### 25.6.16.55 The ndbinfo server\_transactions Table

The `server_transactions` table is subset of
the [`cluster_transactions`](mysql-cluster-ndbinfo-cluster-transactions.md "25.6.16.8 The ndbinfo cluster_transactions Table")
table, but includes only those transactions in which the current
SQL node (MySQL Server) is a participant, while including the
relevant connection IDs.

The `server_transactions` table contains the
following columns:

- `mysql_connection_id`

  MySQL Server connection ID
- `node_id`

  Transaction coordinator node ID
- `block_instance`

  Transaction coordinator block instance
- `transid`

  Transaction ID
- `state`

  Operation state (see text for possible values)
- `count_operations`

  Number of stateful operations in the transaction
- `outstanding_operations`

  Operations still being executed by local data management
  layer (LQH blocks)
- `inactive_seconds`

  Time spent waiting for API
- `client_node_id`

  Client node ID
- `client_block_ref`

  Client block reference

##### Notes

The `mysql_connection_id` is the same as the
connection or session ID shown in the output of
[`SHOW PROCESSLIST`](show-processlist.md "15.7.7.29 SHOW PROCESSLIST Statement"). It is obtained
from the `INFORMATION_SCHEMA` table
[`NDB_TRANSID_MYSQL_CONNECTION_MAP`](information-schema-ndb-transid-mysql-connection-map-table.md "28.3.18 The INFORMATION_SCHEMA ndb_transid_mysql_connection_map Table").

`block_instance` refers to an instance of a
kernel block. Together with the block name, this number can be
used to look up a given instance in the
[`threadblocks`](mysql-cluster-ndbinfo-threadblocks.md "25.6.16.61 The ndbinfo threadblocks Table") table.

The transaction ID (`transid`) is a unique
64-bit number which can be obtained using the NDB API's
[`getTransactionId()`](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/ndbapi/en/ndb-ndbtransaction.html#ndb-ndbtransaction-gettransactionid)
method. (Currently, the MySQL Server does not expose the NDB API
transaction ID of an ongoing transaction.)

The `state` column can have any one of the
values `CS_ABORTING`,
`CS_COMMITTING`,
`CS_COMMIT_SENT`,
`CS_COMPLETE_SENT`,
`CS_COMPLETING`,
`CS_CONNECTED`,
`CS_DISCONNECTED`,
`CS_FAIL_ABORTED`,
`CS_FAIL_ABORTING`,
`CS_FAIL_COMMITTED`,
`CS_FAIL_COMMITTING`,
`CS_FAIL_COMPLETED`,
`CS_FAIL_PREPARED`,
`CS_PREPARE_TO_COMMIT`,
`CS_RECEIVING`,
`CS_REC_COMMITTING`,
`CS_RESTART`,
`CS_SEND_FIRE_TRIG_REQ`,
`CS_STARTED`,
`CS_START_COMMITTING`,
`CS_START_SCAN`,
`CS_WAIT_ABORT_CONF`,
`CS_WAIT_COMMIT_CONF`,
`CS_WAIT_COMPLETE_CONF`,
`CS_WAIT_FIRE_TRIG_REQ`. (If the MySQL Server
is running with
[`ndbinfo_show_hidden`](mysql-cluster-options-variables.md#sysvar_ndbinfo_show_hidden) enabled,
you can view this list of states by selecting from the
`ndb$dbtc_apiconnect_state` table, which is
normally hidden.)

In `client_node_id` and
`client_block_ref`, `client`
refers to an NDB Cluster API or SQL node (that is, an NDB API
client or a MySQL Server attached to the cluster).

The `block_instance` column provides the
[`DBTC`](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/ndb-internals/en/ndb-internals-kernel-blocks-dbtc.html) kernel block instance
number. You can use this to obtain information about specific
threads from the [`threadblocks`](mysql-cluster-ndbinfo-threadblocks.md "25.6.16.61 The ndbinfo threadblocks Table")
table.
