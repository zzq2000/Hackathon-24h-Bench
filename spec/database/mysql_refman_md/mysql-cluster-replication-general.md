### 25.7.2 General Requirements for NDB Cluster Replication

A replication channel requires two MySQL servers acting as
replication servers (one each for the source and replica). For
example, this means that in the case of a replication setup with
two replication channels (to provide an extra channel for
redundancy), there should be a total of four replication nodes,
two per cluster.

Replication of an NDB Cluster as described in this section and
those following is dependent on row-based replication. This means
that the replication source MySQL server must be running with
[`--binlog-format=ROW`](replication-options-binary-log.md#sysvar_binlog_format) or
[`--binlog-format=MIXED`](replication-options-binary-log.md#sysvar_binlog_format), as described
in [Section 25.7.6, “Starting NDB Cluster Replication (Single Replication Channel)”](mysql-cluster-replication-starting.md "25.7.6 Starting NDB Cluster Replication (Single Replication Channel)"). For
general information about row-based replication, see
[Section 19.2.1, “Replication Formats”](replication-formats.md "19.2.1 Replication Formats").

Important

If you attempt to use NDB Cluster Replication with
[`--binlog-format=STATEMENT`](replication-options-binary-log.md#sysvar_binlog_format),
replication fails to work properly because the
`ndb_binlog_index` table on the source cluster
and the `epoch` column of the
`ndb_apply_status` table on the replica cluster
are not updated (see
[Section 25.7.4, “NDB Cluster Replication Schema and Tables”](mysql-cluster-replication-schema.md "25.7.4 NDB Cluster Replication Schema and Tables")). Instead,
only updates on the MySQL server acting as the replication
source propagate to the replica, and no updates from any other
SQL nodes in the source cluster are replicated.

The default value for the
[`--binlog-format`](replication-options-binary-log.md#sysvar_binlog_format) option is
`MIXED`.

Each MySQL server used for replication in either cluster must be
uniquely identified among all the MySQL replication servers
participating in either cluster (you cannot have replication
servers on both the source and replica clusters sharing the same
ID). This can be done by starting each SQL node using the
`--server-id=id` option,
where *`id`* is a unique integer. Although
it is not strictly necessary, we assume for purposes of this
discussion that all NDB Cluster binaries are of the same release
version.

It is generally true in MySQL Replication that both MySQL servers
([**mysqld**](mysqld.md "6.3.1 mysqld — The MySQL Server") processes) involved must be compatible
with one another with respect to both the version of the
replication protocol used and the SQL feature sets which they
support (see [Section 19.5.2, “Replication Compatibility Between MySQL Versions”](replication-compatibility.md "19.5.2 Replication Compatibility Between MySQL Versions")). It is
due to such differences between the binaries in the NDB Cluster
and MySQL Server 8.0 distributions that NDB Cluster
Replication has the additional requirement that both
[**mysqld**](mysqld.md "6.3.1 mysqld — The MySQL Server") binaries come from an NDB Cluster
distribution. The simplest and easiest way to assure that the
[**mysqld**](mysqld.md "6.3.1 mysqld — The MySQL Server") servers are compatible is to use the
same NDB Cluster distribution for all source and replica
[**mysqld**](mysqld.md "6.3.1 mysqld — The MySQL Server") binaries.

We assume that the replica server or cluster is dedicated to
replication of the source cluster, and that no other data is being
stored on it.

All `NDB` tables being replicated must be created
using a MySQL server and client. Tables and other database objects
created using the NDB API (with, for example,
[`Dictionary::createTable()`](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/ndbapi/en/ndb-dictionary.html#ndb-dictionary-createtable)) are
not visible to a MySQL server and so are not replicated. Updates
by NDB API applications to existing tables that were created using
a MySQL server can be replicated.

Note

It is possible to replicate an NDB Cluster using statement-based
replication. However, in this case, the following restrictions
apply:

- All updates to data rows on the cluster acting as the source
  must be directed to a single MySQL server.
- It is not possible to replicate a cluster using multiple
  simultaneous MySQL replication processes.
- Only changes made at the SQL level are replicated.

These are in addition to the other limitations of
statement-based replication as opposed to row-based replication;
see [Section 19.2.1.1, “Advantages and Disadvantages of Statement-Based and Row-Based
Replication”](replication-sbr-rbr.md "19.2.1.1 Advantages and Disadvantages of Statement-Based and Row-Based Replication"), for more specific
information concerning the differences between the two
replication formats.
