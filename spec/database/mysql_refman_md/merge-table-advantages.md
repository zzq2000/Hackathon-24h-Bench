### 18.7.1 MERGE Table Advantages and Disadvantages

`MERGE` tables can help you solve the following
problems:

- Easily manage a set of log tables. For example, you can put
  data from different months into separate tables, compress some
  of them with [**myisampack**](myisampack.md "6.6.6 myisampack — Generate Compressed, Read-Only MyISAM Tables"), and then create a
  `MERGE` table to use them as one.
- Obtain more speed. You can split a large read-only table based
  on some criteria, and then put individual tables on different
  disks. A `MERGE` table structured this way
  could be much faster than using a single large table.
- Perform more efficient searches. If you know exactly what you
  are looking for, you can search in just one of the underlying
  tables for some queries and use a `MERGE`
  table for others. You can even have many different
  `MERGE` tables that use overlapping sets of
  tables.
- Perform more efficient repairs. It is easier to repair
  individual smaller tables that are mapped to a
  `MERGE` table than to repair a single large
  table.
- Instantly map many tables as one. A `MERGE`
  table need not maintain an index of its own because it uses
  the indexes of the individual tables. As a result,
  `MERGE` table collections are
  *very* fast to create or remap. (You must
  still specify the index definitions when you create a
  `MERGE` table, even though no indexes are
  created.)
- If you have a set of tables from which you create a large
  table on demand, you can instead create a
  `MERGE` table from them on demand. This is
  much faster and saves a lot of disk space.
- Exceed the file size limit for the operating system. Each
  `MyISAM` table is bound by this limit, but a
  collection of `MyISAM` tables is not.
- You can create an alias or synonym for a
  `MyISAM` table by defining a
  `MERGE` table that maps to that single table.
  There should be no really notable performance impact from
  doing this (only a couple of indirect calls and
  `memcpy()` calls for each read).

The disadvantages of `MERGE` tables are:

- You can use only identical `MyISAM` tables
  for a `MERGE` table.
- Some `MyISAM` features are unavailable in
  `MERGE` tables. For example, you cannot
  create `FULLTEXT` indexes on
  `MERGE` tables. (You can create
  `FULLTEXT` indexes on the underlying
  `MyISAM` tables, but you cannot search the
  `MERGE` table with a full-text search.)
- If the `MERGE` table is nontemporary, all
  underlying `MyISAM` tables must be
  nontemporary. If the `MERGE` table is
  temporary, the `MyISAM` tables can be any mix
  of temporary and nontemporary.
- `MERGE` tables use more file descriptors than
  `MyISAM` tables. If 10 clients are using a
  `MERGE` table that maps to 10 tables, the
  server uses (10 × 10) + 10 file descriptors. (10 data
  file descriptors for each of the 10 clients, and 10 index file
  descriptors shared among the clients.)
- Index reads are slower. When you read an index, the
  `MERGE` storage engine needs to issue a read
  on all underlying tables to check which one most closely
  matches a given index value. To read the next index value, the
  `MERGE` storage engine needs to search the
  read buffers to find the next value. Only when one index
  buffer is used up does the storage engine need to read the
  next index block. This makes `MERGE` indexes
  much slower on [`eq_ref`](explain-output.md#jointype_eq_ref)
  searches, but not much slower on
  [`ref`](explain-output.md#jointype_ref) searches. For more
  information about [`eq_ref`](explain-output.md#jointype_eq_ref)
  and [`ref`](explain-output.md#jointype_ref), see
