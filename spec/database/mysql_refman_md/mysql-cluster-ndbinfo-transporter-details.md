#### 25.6.16.64 The ndbinfo transporter\_details Table

This table contains information about individual NDB
transporters, rather than aggregate information as shown by the
[`transporters`](mysql-cluster-ndbinfo-transporters.md "25.6.16.65 The ndbinfo transporters Table") table. The
`transporter_details` table was added in NDB
8.0.37.

The `transporter_details` table contains the
following columns:

- `node_id`

  This data node's unique node ID in the cluster
- `block_instance`
- `trp_id`

  The transporter ID
- `remote_node_id`

  The remote data node's node ID
- `status`

  Status of the connection
- `remote_address`

  Name or IP address of the remote host
- `bytes_sent`

  Number of bytes sent using this connection
- `bytes_received`

  Number of bytes received using this connection
- `connect_count`

  Number of times connection established on this transporter
- `overloaded`

  1 if this transporter is currently overloaded, otherwise 0
- `overload_count`

  Number of times this transporter has entered overload state
  since connecting
- `slowdown`

  1 if this transporter is in slowdown state, otherwise 0
- `slowdown_count`

  Number of times this transporter has entered slowdown state
  since connecting
- `encrypted`

  If this transporter is connected using TLS, this column is
  `1`, otherwise it is `0`.
- `sendbuffer_used_bytes`

  The amount, in bytes, of signal data currently awaiting send
  by this transporter.
- `sendbuffer_max_used_bytes`

  The maximum amount, in bytes, of signal data awaiting send
  at any one time by this transporter.
- `sendbuffer_alloc_bytes`

  Amount of send buffer, in bytes, currently allocated for
  signal data storage for this transporter.
- `sendbuffer_max_alloc_bytes`

  Maxmimum amount of send buffer, in bytes, allocated for
  signal data storage at any one time for this transporter.
- `type`

  The connection type used by this transporter
  (`TCP` or `SHM`).

The `transporter_details` table displays a row
showing the status of each transporter in the cluster. See the
Notes for the [`transporters`](mysql-cluster-ndbinfo-transporters.md "25.6.16.65 The ndbinfo transporters Table")
table for more information about each of the columns in this
table.

The `sendbuffer_used_bytes`,
`sendbuffer_max_used_bytes`,
`sendbuffer_alloc_bytes`,
`sendbuffer_max_alloc_bytes`, and
`type` columns were added in NDB 8.0.38.
