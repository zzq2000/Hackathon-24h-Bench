### 19.5.4 Troubleshooting Replication

If you have followed the instructions but your replication setup
is not working, the first thing to do is *check the error
log for messages*. Many users have lost time by not
doing this soon enough after encountering problems.

If you cannot tell from the error log what the problem was, try
the following techniques:

- Verify that the source has binary logging enabled by issuing a
  [`SHOW MASTER STATUS`](show-master-status.md "15.7.7.23 SHOW MASTER STATUS Statement") statement.
  Binary logging is enabled by default. If binary logging is
  enabled, `Position` is nonzero. If binary
  logging is not enabled, verify that you are not running the
  source with any settings that disable binary logging, such as
  the
  [`--skip-log-bin`](replication-options-binary-log.md#option_mysqld_log-bin)
  option.
- Verify that the [`server_id`](replication-options.md#sysvar_server_id)
  system variable was set at startup on both the source and
  replica and that the ID value is unique on each server.
- Verify that the replica is running. Use
  [`SHOW REPLICA STATUS`](show-replica-status.md "15.7.7.35 SHOW REPLICA STATUS Statement") to check
  whether the `Replica_IO_Running` and
  `Replica_SQL_Running` values are both
  `Yes`. If not, verify the options that were
  used when starting the replica server. For example, the
  [`--skip-slave-start`](replication-options-replica.md#option_mysqld_skip-slave-start) command line
  option, or from MySQL 8.0.24, the
  [`skip_slave_start`](replication-options-replica.md#sysvar_skip_slave_start) system
  variable, prevents the replication threads from starting until
  you issue a [`START REPLICA`](start-replica.md "15.4.2.6 START REPLICA Statement")
  statement.
- If the replica is running, check whether it established a
  connection to the source. Use [`SHOW
  PROCESSLIST`](show-processlist.md "15.7.7.29 SHOW PROCESSLIST Statement"), find the I/O (receiver) and SQL
  (applier) threads and check their `State`
  column to see what they display. See
  [Section 19.2.3, “Replication Threads”](replication-threads.md "19.2.3 Replication Threads"). If the receiver thread
  state says `Connecting to master`, check the
  following:

  - Verify the privileges for the replication user on the
    source.
  - Check that the host name of the source is correct and that
    you are using the correct port to connect to the source.
    The port used for replication is the same as used for
    client network communication (the default is
    `3306`). For the host name, ensure that
    the name resolves to the correct IP address.
  - Check the configuration file to see whether the
    [`skip_networking`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_skip_networking) system
    variable has been enabled on the source or replica to
    disable networking. If so, comment the setting or remove
    it.
  - If the source has a firewall or IP filtering
    configuration, ensure that the network port being used for
    MySQL is not being filtered.
  - Check that you can reach the source by using
    `ping` or
    `traceroute`/`tracert`
    to reach the host.
- If the replica was running previously but has stopped, the
  reason usually is that some statement that succeeded on the
  source failed on the replica. This should never happen if you
  have taken a proper snapshot of the source, and never modified
  the data on the replica outside of the replication threads. If
  the replica stops unexpectedly, it is a bug or you have
  encountered one of the known replication limitations described
  in [Section 19.5.1, “Replication Features and Issues”](replication-features.md "19.5.1 Replication Features and Issues"). If it is a bug, see
  [Section 19.5.5, “How to Report Replication Bugs or Problems”](replication-bugs.md "19.5.5 How to Report Replication Bugs or Problems"), for instructions on how to
  report it.
- If a statement that succeeded on the source refuses to run on
  the replica, try the following procedure if it is not feasible
  to do a full database resynchronization by deleting the
  replica's databases and copying a new snapshot from the
  source:

  1. Determine whether the affected table on the replica is
     different from the source table. Try to understand how
     this happened. Then make the replica's table identical to
     the source's and run [`START
     REPLICA`](start-replica.md "15.4.2.6 START REPLICA Statement").
  2. If the preceding step does not work or does not apply, try
     to understand whether it would be safe to make the update
     manually (if needed) and then ignore the next statement
     from the source.
  3. If you decide that the replica can skip the next statement
     from the source, issue the following statements:

     ```sql
     mysql> SET GLOBAL sql_slave_skip_counter = N;
     mysql> START SLAVE;

     Or from MySQL 8.0.26:
     mysql> SET GLOBAL sql_replica_skip_counter = N;
     mysql> START REPLICA;
     ```

     The value of *`N`* should be 1 if
     the next statement from the source does not use
     `AUTO_INCREMENT` or
     [`LAST_INSERT_ID()`](information-functions.md#function_last-insert-id).
     Otherwise, the value should be 2. The reason for using a
     value of 2 for statements that use
     `AUTO_INCREMENT` or
     [`LAST_INSERT_ID()`](information-functions.md#function_last-insert-id) is that
     they take two events in the binary log of the source.

     See also
     [SET GLOBAL sql\_slave\_skip\_counter Syntax](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/set-global-sql-slave-skip-counter.html).
  4. If you are sure that the replica started out perfectly
     synchronized with the source, and that no one has updated
     the tables involved outside of the replication threads,
     then presumably the discrepancy is the result of a bug. If
     you are running the most recent version of MySQL, please
     report the problem. If you are running an older version,
     try upgrading to the latest production release to
     determine whether the problem persists.
