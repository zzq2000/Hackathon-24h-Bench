#### 29.12.6.3 The events\_statements\_history\_long Table

The
[`events_statements_history_long`](performance-schema-events-statements-history-long-table.md "29.12.6.3 The events_statements_history_long Table")
table contains the *`N`* most recent
statement events that have ended globally, across all threads.
Statement events are not added to the table until they have
ended. When the table becomes full, the oldest row is
discarded when a new row is added, regardless of which thread
generated either row.

The value of *`N`* is autosized at
server startup. To set the table size explicitly, set the
[`performance_schema_events_statements_history_long_size`](performance-schema-system-variables.md#sysvar_performance_schema_events_statements_history_long_size)
system variable at server startup.

The
[`events_statements_history_long`](performance-schema-events-statements-history-long-table.md "29.12.6.3 The events_statements_history_long Table")
table has the same columns as
[`events_statements_current`](performance-schema-events-statements-current-table.md "29.12.6.1 The events_statements_current Table"). See
[Section 29.12.6.1, “The events\_statements\_current Table”](performance-schema-events-statements-current-table.md "29.12.6.1 The events_statements_current Table").
Unlike [`events_statements_current`](performance-schema-events-statements-current-table.md "29.12.6.1 The events_statements_current Table"),
[`events_statements_history_long`](performance-schema-events-statements-history-long-table.md "29.12.6.3 The events_statements_history_long Table")
has no indexing.

[`TRUNCATE TABLE`](truncate-table.md "15.1.37 TRUNCATE TABLE Statement") is permitted for
the
[`events_statements_history_long`](performance-schema-events-statements-history-long-table.md "29.12.6.3 The events_statements_history_long Table")
table. It removes the rows.

`events_statements_xxx`
event tables, see
[Section 29.9, “Performance Schema Tables for Current and Historical Events”](performance-schema-event-tables.md "29.9 Performance Schema Tables for Current and Historical Events").

events, see
