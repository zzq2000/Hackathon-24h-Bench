### 6.2.8 Connection Compression Control

Connections to the server can use compression on the traffic
between client and server to reduce the number of bytes sent over
the connection. By default, connections are uncompressed, but can
be compressed if the server and the client agree on a mutually
permitted compression algorithm.

Compressed connections originate on the client side but affect CPU
load on both the client and server sides because both sides
perform compression and decompression operations. Because enabling
compression decreases performance, its benefits occur primarily
when there is low network bandwidth, network transfer time
dominates the cost of compression and decompression operations,
and result sets are large.

This section describes the available compression-control
configuration parameters and the information sources available for
monitoring use of compression. It applies to classic MySQL protocol
connections.

Compression control applies to connections to the server by client
programs and by servers participating in source/replica
replication or Group Replication. Compression control does not
apply to connections for `FEDERATED` tables. In
the following discussion, “client connection” is
shorthand for a connection to the server originating from any
source for which compression is supported, unless context
indicates a specific connection type.

Note

X Protocol connections to a MySQL Server instance support
compression from MySQL 8.0.19, but compression for X Protocol
connections operates independently from the compression for
classic MySQL protocol connections described here, and is controlled
separately. See
[Section 22.5.5, “Connection Compression with X Plugin”](x-plugin-connection-compression.md "22.5.5 Connection Compression with X Plugin") for
information on X Protocol connection compression.

#### Configuring Connection Compression

As of MySQL 8.0.18, these configuration parameters are available
for controlling connection compression:

- The
  [`protocol_compression_algorithms`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_protocol_compression_algorithms)
  system variable configures which compression algorithms the
  server permits for incoming connections.
- The [`--compression-algorithms`](connection-options.md#option_general_compression-algorithms)
  and [`--zstd-compression-level`](connection-options.md#option_general_zstd-compression-level)
  command-line options configure permitted compression
  algorithms and `zstd` compression level for
  these client programs: [**mysql**](mysql.md "6.5.1 mysql — The MySQL Command-Line Client"),
  [**mysqladmin**](mysqladmin.md "6.5.2 mysqladmin — A MySQL Server Administration Program"),
  [**mysqlbinlog**](mysqlbinlog.md "6.6.9 mysqlbinlog — Utility for Processing Binary Log Files"),
  [**mysqlcheck**](mysqlcheck.md "6.5.3 mysqlcheck — A Table Maintenance Program"), [**mysqldump**](mysqldump.md "6.5.4 mysqldump — A Database Backup Program"),
  [**mysqlimport**](mysqlimport.md "6.5.5 mysqlimport — A Data Import Program"),
  [**mysqlpump**](mysqlpump.md "6.5.6 mysqlpump — A Database Backup Program"), [**mysqlshow**](mysqlshow.md "6.5.7 mysqlshow — Display Database, Table, and Column Information"),
  [**mysqlslap**](mysqlslap.md "6.5.8 mysqlslap — A Load Emulation Client"), and
  **mysqltest**, and
  [**mysql\_upgrade**](mysql-upgrade.md "6.4.5 mysql_upgrade — Check and Upgrade MySQL Tables"). MySQL Shell also offers
  these command-line options from its 8.0.20 release.
- The `MYSQL_OPT_COMPRESSION_ALGORITHMS` and
  `MYSQL_OPT_ZSTD_COMPRESSION_LEVEL` options
  for the [`mysql_options()`](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/c-api/8.0/en/mysql-options.html)
  function configure permitted compression algorithms and
  `zstd` compression level for client
  programs that use the MySQL C API.
- The `MASTER_COMPRESSION_ALGORITHMS` and
  `MASTER_ZSTD_COMPRESSION_LEVEL` options for
  the [`CHANGE MASTER TO`](change-master-to.md "15.4.2.1 CHANGE MASTER TO Statement")
  statement configure permitted compression algorithms and
  `zstd` compression level for replica
  servers participating in source/replica replication. From
  MySQL 8.0.23, use the statement [`CHANGE
  REPLICATION SOURCE TO`](change-replication-source-to.md "15.4.2.3 CHANGE REPLICATION SOURCE TO Statement") and the options
  `SOURCE_COMPRESSION_ALGORITHMS` and
  `SOURCE_ZSTD_COMPRESSION_LEVEL` instead.
- The
  [`group_replication_recovery_compression_algorithms`](group-replication-system-variables.md#sysvar_group_replication_recovery_compression_algorithms)
  and
  [`group_replication_recovery_zstd_compression_level`](group-replication-system-variables.md#sysvar_group_replication_recovery_zstd_compression_level)
  system variables configure permitted compression algorithms
  and `zstd` compression level for Group
  Replication recovery connections when a new member joins a
  group and connects to a donor.

Configuration parameters that enable specifying compression
algorithms are string-valued and take a list of one or more
comma-separated compression algorithm names, in any order,
chosen from the following items (not case-sensitive):

- `zlib`: Permit connections that use the
  `zlib` compression algorithm.
- `zstd`: Permit connections that use the
  `zstd` compression algorithm.
- `uncompressed`: Permit uncompressed
  connections.

Note

Because `uncompressed` is an algorithm name
that may or may not be configured, it is possible to configure
MySQL *not* to permit uncompressed
connections.

Examples:

- To configure which compression algorithms the server permits
  for incoming connections, set the
  [`protocol_compression_algorithms`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_protocol_compression_algorithms)
  system variable. By default, the server permits all
  available algorithms. To configure that setting explicitly
  at startup, use these lines in the server
  `my.cnf` file:

  ```ini
  [mysqld]
  protocol_compression_algorithms=zlib,zstd,uncompressed
  ```

  To set and persist the
  [`protocol_compression_algorithms`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_protocol_compression_algorithms)
  system variable to that value at runtime, use this
  statement:

  ```sql
  SET PERSIST protocol_compression_algorithms='zlib,zstd,uncompressed';
  ```

  [`SET
  PERSIST`](set-variable.md "15.7.6.1 SET Syntax for Variable Assignment") sets a value for the running MySQL
  instance. It also saves the value, causing it to carry over
  to subsequent server restarts. To change the value for the
  running MySQL instance without having it carry over to
  subsequent restarts, use the `GLOBAL`
  keyword rather than `PERSIST`. See
  [Section 15.7.6.1, “SET Syntax for Variable Assignment”](set-variable.md "15.7.6.1 SET Syntax for Variable Assignment").
- To permit only incoming connections that use
  `zstd` compression, configure the server at
  startup like this:

  ```ini
  [mysqld]
  protocol_compression_algorithms=zstd
  ```

  Or, to make the change at runtime:

  ```sql
  SET PERSIST protocol_compression_algorithms='zstd';
  ```
- To permit the [**mysql**](mysql.md "6.5.1 mysql — The MySQL Command-Line Client") client to initiate
  `zlib` or `uncompressed`
  connections, invoke it like this:

  ```terminal
  mysql --compression-algorithms=zlib,uncompressed
  ```
- To configure replicas to connect to the source using
  `zlib` or `zstd`
  connections, with a compression level of 7 for
  `zstd` connections, use a
  [`CHANGE REPLICATION SOURCE TO`](change-replication-source-to.md "15.4.2.3 CHANGE REPLICATION SOURCE TO Statement")
  statement (from MySQL 8.0.23) or [`CHANGE
  MASTER TO`](change-master-to.md "15.4.2.1 CHANGE MASTER TO Statement") statement (before MySQL 8.0.23):

  ```sql
  CHANGE REPLICATION SOURCE TO
    SOURCE_COMPRESSION_ALGORITHMS = 'zlib,zstd',
    SOURCE_ZSTD_COMPRESSION_LEVEL = 7;
  ```

  This assumes that the
  [`replica_compressed_protocol`](replication-options-replica.md#sysvar_replica_compressed_protocol)
  or
  [`slave_compressed_protocol`](replication-options-replica.md#sysvar_slave_compressed_protocol)
  system variable is disabled, for reasons described in
  [Configuring Legacy Connection Compression](connection-compression-control.md#connection-compression-legacy-configuration "Configuring Legacy Connection Compression").

For successful connection setup, both sides of the connection
must agree on a mutually permitted compression algorithm. The
algorithm-negotiation process attempts to use
`zlib`, then `zstd`, then
`uncompressed`. If the two sides can find no
common algorithm, the connection attempt fails.

Because both sides must agree on the compression algorithm, and
because `uncompressed` is an algorithm value
that is not necessarily permitted, fallback to an uncompressed
connection does not necessarily occur. For example, if the
server is configured to permit `zstd` and a
client is configured to permit
`zlib,uncompressed`, the client cannot connect
at all. In this case, no algorithm is common to both sides, so
connection attempts fail.

Configuration parameters that enable specifying the
`zstd` compression level take an integer value
from 1 to 22, with larger values indicating increasing levels of
compression. The default `zstd` compression
level is 3. The compression level setting has no effect on
connections that do not use `zstd` compression.

A configurable `zstd` compression level enables
choosing between less network traffic and higher CPU load versus
more network traffic and lower CPU load. Higher compression
levels reduce network congestion but the additional CPU load may
reduce server performance.

#### Configuring Legacy Connection Compression

Prior to MySQL 8.0.18, these configuration parameters are
available for controlling connection compression:

- Client programs support a
  [`--compress`](connection-options.md#option_general_compress) command-line
  option to specify use of compression for the connection to
  the server.
- For programs that use the MySQL C API, enabling the
  `MYSQL_OPT_COMPRESS` option for the
  [`mysql_options()`](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/c-api/8.0/en/mysql-options.html) function
  specifies use of compression for the connection to the
  server.
- For source/replica replication, enabling the system variable
  [`replica_compressed_protocol`](replication-options-replica.md#sysvar_replica_compressed_protocol)
  (from MySQL 8.0.26) or
  [`slave_compressed_protocol`](replication-options-replica.md#sysvar_slave_compressed_protocol)
  (before MySQL 8.0.26) specifies use of compression for
  replica connections to the source.

In each case, when use of compression is specified, the
connection uses the `zlib` compression
algorithm if both sides permit it, with fallback to an
uncompressed connection otherwise.

As of MySQL 8.0.18, the compression parameters just described
become legacy parameters, due to the additional compression
parameters introduced for more control over connection
compression that are described in
[Configuring Connection Compression](connection-compression-control.md#connection-compression-configuration "Configuring Connection Compression"). An
exception is MySQL Shell, where the
[`--compress`](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/mysql-shell/8.0/en/mysqlsh.html#option_mysqlsh_compress) command-line option
remains current, and can be used to request compression without
selecting compression algorithms. For information on
MySQL Shell's connection compression control, see
[Using Compressed Connections](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/mysql-shell/8.0/en/mysql-shell-compressed-connections.html).

The legacy compression parameters interact with the newer
parameters and their semantics change as follows:

- The meaning of the legacy
  [`--compress`](connection-options.md#option_general_compress) option depends on
  whether
  [`--compression-algorithms`](connection-options.md#option_general_compression-algorithms) is
  specified:

  - When
    [`--compression-algorithms`](connection-options.md#option_general_compression-algorithms)
    is not specified,
    [`--compress`](connection-options.md#option_general_compress) is equivalent
    to specifying a client-side algorithm set of
    `zlib,uncompressed`.
  - When
    [`--compression-algorithms`](connection-options.md#option_general_compression-algorithms)
    is specified, [`--compress`](connection-options.md#option_general_compress)
    is equivalent to specifying an algorithm set of
    `zlib` and the full client-side
    algorithm set is the union of `zlib`
    plus the algorithms specified by
    [`--compression-algorithms`](connection-options.md#option_general_compression-algorithms).
    For example, with both
    [`--compress`](connection-options.md#option_general_compress) and
    [`--compression-algorithms=zlib,zstd`](connection-options.md#option_general_compression-algorithms),
    the permitted-algorithm set is `zlib`
    plus `zlib,zstd`; that is,
    `zlib,zstd`. With both
    [`--compress`](connection-options.md#option_general_compress) and
    [`--compression-algorithms=zstd,uncompressed`](connection-options.md#option_general_compression-algorithms),
    the permitted-algorithm set is `zlib`
    plus `zstd,uncompressed`; that is,
    `zlib,zstd,uncompressed`.
- The same type of interaction occurs between the legacy
  `MYSQL_OPT_COMPRESS` option and the
  `MYSQL_OPT_COMPRESSION_ALGORITHMS` option
  for the [`mysql_options()`](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/c-api/8.0/en/mysql-options.html) C
  API function.
- If the
  [`replica_compressed_protocol`](replication-options-replica.md#sysvar_replica_compressed_protocol)
  or
  [`slave_compressed_protocol`](replication-options-replica.md#sysvar_slave_compressed_protocol)
  system variable is enabled, it takes precedence over
  `MASTER_COMPRESSION_ALGORITHMS` and
  connections to the source use `zlib`
  compression if both source and replica permit that
  algorithm. If
  [`replica_compressed_protocol`](replication-options-replica.md#sysvar_replica_compressed_protocol)
  or
  [`slave_compressed_protocol`](replication-options-replica.md#sysvar_slave_compressed_protocol)
  is disabled, the value of
  `MASTER_COMPRESSION_ALGORITHMS` applies.

Note

The legacy compression-control parameters are deprecated as of
MySQL 8.0.18; expect it to be removed in a future version of
MySQL.

#### Monitoring Connection Compression

The [`Compression`](server-status-variables.md#statvar_Compression) status
variable is `ON` or `OFF` to
indicate whether the current connection uses compression.

The [**mysql**](mysql.md "6.5.1 mysql — The MySQL Command-Line Client") client `\status`
command displays a line that says `Protocol:
Compressed` if compression is enabled for the current
connection. If that line is not present, the connection is
uncompressed.

As of 8.0.14, the MySQL Shell `\status`
command displays a `Compression:` line that
says `Disabled` or `Enabled`
to indicate whether the connection is compressed.

As of MySQL 8.0.18, these additional sources of information are
available for monitoring connection compression:

- To monitor compression in use for client connections, use
  the [`Compression_algorithm`](server-status-variables.md#statvar_Compression_algorithm)
  and [`Compression_level`](server-status-variables.md#statvar_Compression_level)
  status variables. For the current connection, their values
  indicate the compression algorithm and compression level,
  respectively.
- To determine which compression algorithms the server is
  configured to permit for incoming connections, check the
  [`protocol_compression_algorithms`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_protocol_compression_algorithms)
  system variable.
- For source/replica replication connections, the configured
  compression algorithms and compression level are available
  from multiple sources:

  - The Performance Schema
    [`replication_connection_configuration`](performance-schema-replication-connection-configuration-table.md "29.12.11.10 The replication_connection_configuration Table")
    table has `COMPRESSION_ALGORITHMS` and
    `ZSTD_COMPRESSION_LEVEL` columns.
  - The `mysql.slave_master_info` system
    table has
    `Master_compression_algorithms` and
    `Master_zstd_compression_level`
    columns. If the `master.info` file
    exists, it contains lines for those values as well.
