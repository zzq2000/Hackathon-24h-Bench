#### 30.4.3.10 The io\_by\_thread\_by\_latency and x$io\_by\_thread\_by\_latency Views

These views summarize I/O consumers to display time waiting
for I/O, grouped by thread. By default, rows are sorted by
descending total I/O latency.

The [`io_by_thread_by_latency`](sys-io-by-thread-by-latency.md "30.4.3.10 The io_by_thread_by_latency and x$io_by_thread_by_latency Views") and
[`x$io_by_thread_by_latency`](sys-io-by-thread-by-latency.md "30.4.3.10 The io_by_thread_by_latency and x$io_by_thread_by_latency Views") views
have these columns:

- `user`

  For foreground threads, the account associated with the
  thread. For background threads, the thread name.
- `total`

  The total number of I/O events for the thread.
- `total_latency`

  The total wait time of timed I/O events for the thread.
- `min_latency`

  The minimum single wait time of timed I/O events for the
  thread.
- `avg_latency`

  The average wait time per timed I/O event for the thread.
- `max_latency`

  The maximum single wait time of timed I/O events for the
  thread.
- `thread_id`

  The thread ID.
- `processlist_id`

  For foreground threads, the processlist ID of the thread.
  For background threads, `NULL`.
