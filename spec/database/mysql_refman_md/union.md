### 15.2.18 UNION Clause

```sql
query_expression_body UNION [ALL | DISTINCT] query_block
    [UNION [ALL | DISTINCT] query_expression_body]
    [...]

query_expression_body:
    See Section 15.2.14, “Set Operations with UNION, INTERSECT, and EXCEPT”
```

[`UNION`](union.md "15.2.18 UNION Clause") combines the result from
multiple query blocks into a single result set. This example uses
`SELECT` statements:

```sql
mysql> SELECT 1, 2;
+---+---+
| 1 | 2 |
+---+---+
| 1 | 2 |
+---+---+
mysql> SELECT 'a', 'b';
+---+---+
| a | b |
+---+---+
| a | b |
+---+---+
mysql> SELECT 1, 2 UNION SELECT 'a', 'b';
+---+---+
| 1 | 2 |
+---+---+
| 1 | 2 |
| a | b |
+---+---+
```

#### UNION Handing in MySQL 8.0 Compared to MySQL 5.7

In MySQL 8.0, the parser rules for
[`SELECT`](select.md "15.2.13 SELECT Statement") and
[`UNION`](union.md "15.2.18 UNION Clause") were refactored to be more
consistent (the same [`SELECT`](select.md "15.2.13 SELECT Statement") syntax
applies uniformly in each such context) and reduce duplication.
Compared to MySQL 5.7, several user-visible effects
resulted from this work, which may require rewriting of certain
statements:

- `NATURAL JOIN` permits an optional
  `INNER` keyword (`NATURAL INNER
  JOIN`), in compliance with standard SQL.
- Right-deep joins without parentheses are permitted (for
  example, `... JOIN ... JOIN ... ON ... ON`),
  in compliance with standard SQL.
- `STRAIGHT_JOIN` now permits a
  `USING` clause, similar to other inner joins.
- The parser accepts parentheses around query expressions. For
  example, `(SELECT ... UNION SELECT ...)` is
  permitted. See also
  [Section 15.2.11, “Parenthesized Query Expressions”](parenthesized-query-expressions.md "15.2.11 Parenthesized Query Expressions").
- The parser better conforms to the documented permitted
  placement of the `SQL_CACHE` and
  `SQL_NO_CACHE` query modifiers.
- Left-hand nesting of unions, previously permitted only in
  subqueries, is now permitted in top-level statements. For
  example, this statement is now accepted as valid:

  ```sql
  (SELECT 1 UNION SELECT 1) UNION SELECT 1;
  ```
- Locking clauses (`FOR UPDATE`, `LOCK
  IN SHARE MODE`) are allowed only in
  non-`UNION` queries. This means that
  parentheses must be used for `SELECT`
  statements containing locking clauses. This statement is no
  longer accepted as valid:

  ```sql
  SELECT 1 FOR UPDATE UNION SELECT 1 FOR UPDATE;
  ```

  Instead, write the statement like this:

  ```sql
  (SELECT 1 FOR UPDATE) UNION (SELECT 1 FOR UPDATE);
  ```
