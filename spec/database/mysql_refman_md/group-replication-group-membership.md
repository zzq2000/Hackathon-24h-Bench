#### 20.1.4.1 Group Membership

In MySQL Group Replication, a set of servers forms a replication
group. A group has a name, which takes the form of a UUID. The
group is dynamic and servers can leave (either voluntarily or
involuntarily) and join it at any time. The group adjusts itself
whenever servers join or leave.

If a server joins the group, it automatically brings itself up
to date by fetching the missing state from an existing server.
If a server leaves the group, for instance it was taken down for
maintenance, the remaining servers notice that it has left and
reconfigure the group automatically.

Group Replication has a group membership service that defines
which servers are online and participating in the group. The
list of online servers is referred to as a
*view*. Every server in the group has a
consistent view of which servers are the members participating
actively in the group at a given moment in time.

Group members must agree not only on transaction commits, but
also on which is the current view. If existing members agree
that a new server should become part of the group, the group is
reconfigured to integrate that server in it, which triggers a
view change. If a server leaves the group, either voluntarily or
not, the group dynamically rearranges its configuration and a
view change is triggered.

In the case where a member leaves the group voluntarily, it
first initiates a dynamic group reconfiguration, during which
all members have to agree on a new view without the leaving
server. However, if a member leaves the group involuntarily, for
example because it has stopped unexpectedly or the network
connection is down, it cannot initiate the reconfiguration. In
this situation, Group Replication's failure detection mechanism
recognizes after a short period of time that the member has
left, and a reconfiguration of the group without the failed
member is proposed. As with a member that leaves voluntarily,
the reconfiguration requires agreement from the majority of
servers in the group. However, if the group is not able to reach
agreement, for example because it partitioned in such a way that
there is no majority of servers online, the system is not able
to dynamically change the configuration, and blocks to prevent a
split-brain situation. This situation requires intervention from
an administrator.

It is possible for a member to go offline for a short time, then
attempt to rejoin the group again before the failure detection
mechanism has detected its failure, and before the group has
been reconfigured to remove the member. In this situation, the
rejoining member forgets its previous state, but if other
members send it messages that are intended for its pre-crash
state, this can cause issues including possible data
inconsistency. If a member in this situation participates in
XCom's consensus protocol, it could potentially cause XCom to
deliver different values for the same consensus round, by making
a different decision before and after failure.

To counter this possibility, MySQL Group Replication checks for
the situation where a new incarnation of the same server is
trying to join the group while its old incarnation (with the
same address and port number) is still listed as a member. The
new incarnation is blocked from joining the group until the old
incarnation can be removed by a reconfiguration. Note that if a
waiting period has been added by the
[`group_replication_member_expel_timeout`](group-replication-system-variables.md#sysvar_group_replication_member_expel_timeout)
system variable to allow additional time for members to
reconnect with the group before they are expelled, a member
under suspicion can become active in the group again as its
current incarnation if it reconnects to the group before the
suspicion times out. When a member exceeds the expel timeout and
is expelled from the group, or when Group Replication is stopped
on the server by a [`STOP
GROUP_REPLICATION`](stop-group-replication.md "15.4.3.2 STOP GROUP_REPLICATION Statement") statement or a server failure, it
must rejoin as a new incarnation.
