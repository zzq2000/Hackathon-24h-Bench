#### 25.6.8.2 Using The NDB Cluster Management Client to Create a Backup

Before starting a backup, make sure that the cluster is properly
configured for performing one. (See
[Section 25.6.8.3, “Configuration for NDB Cluster Backups”](mysql-cluster-backup-configuration.md "25.6.8.3 Configuration for NDB Cluster Backups").)

The `START BACKUP` command is used to create a
backup, and has the syntax shown here:

```simple
START BACKUP [backup_id]
    [encryption_option]
    [wait_option]
    [snapshot_option]

encryption_option:
ENCRYPT [PASSWORD=password]

password:
{'password_string' | "password_string"}

wait_option:
WAIT {STARTED | COMPLETED} | NOWAIT

snapshot_option:
SNAPSHOTSTART | SNAPSHOTEND
```

Successive backups are automatically identified sequentially, so
the *`backup_id`*, an integer greater
than or equal to 1, is optional; if it is omitted, the next
available value is used. If an existing
*`backup_id`* value is used, the backup
fails with the error Backup failed: file already
exists. If used, the
*`backup_id`* must follow immediately
after the `START BACKUP` keywords, before any
other options are used.

In NDB 8.0.22 and later, `START BACKUP`
supports the creation of encrypted backups using
`ENCRYPT
PASSWORD=password`. The
*`password`* must meet all of the
following requirements:

- Uses any of the printable ASCII characters except
  `!`, `'`,
  `"`, `$`,
  `%`, `\`, and
  `^`
- Is no more than 256 characters in length
- Is enclosed by single or double quotation marks

When `ENCRYPT
PASSWORD='password'` is
used, the backup data record and log files written by each data
node are encrypted with a key derived from the user-provided
*`password`* and a randomly-generated
salt using a key derivation function (KDF) that employs the
PBKDF2-SHA256 algorithm to generate a symmetric encryption key
for that file. This function has the form shown here:

```simple
key = KDF(random_salt, password)
```

The key so generated is then used to encrypt the backup data
using AES 256 CBC inline, and symmetric encryption is employed
for encrypting the backup fileset (with the generated key).

Note

NDB Cluster *never* saves the
user-furnished password or generated encryption key.

Starting with NDB 8.0.24, the `PASSWORD` option
can be omitted from
*`encryption_option`*. In this case, the
management client prompts the user for a password.

It is possible using `PASSWORD` to set an empty
password (`''` or `""`), but
this is not recommended.

An encrypted backup can be decrypted using any of the following
commands:

- [**ndb\_restore**](mysql-cluster-programs-ndb-restore.md "25.5.23 ndb_restore — Restore an NDB Cluster Backup")
  [`--decrypt`](mysql-cluster-programs-ndb-restore.md#option_ndb_restore_decrypt)
  [`--backup-password=password`](mysql-cluster-programs-ndb-restore.md#option_ndb_restore_backup-password)
- [**ndbxfrm**](mysql-cluster-programs-ndbxfrm.md "25.5.31 ndbxfrm — Compress, Decompress, Encrypt, and Decrypt Files Created by NDB Cluster")
  [`--decrypt-password=password`](mysql-cluster-programs-ndbxfrm.md#option_ndbxfrm_decrypt-password)
  *`input_file`*
  *`output_file`*
- [**ndb\_print\_backup\_file**](mysql-cluster-programs-ndb-print-backup-file.md "25.5.17 ndb_print_backup_file — Print NDB Backup File Contents")
  [`-P`](mysql-cluster-programs-ndb-print-backup-file.md#option_ndb_print_backup_file_backup-password)
  *`password`*
  *`file_name`*

NDB 8.0.24 and later supports the additional commands listed
here:

- [**ndb\_restore**](mysql-cluster-programs-ndb-restore.md "25.5.23 ndb_restore — Restore an NDB Cluster Backup")
  [`--decrypt`](mysql-cluster-programs-ndb-restore.md#option_ndb_restore_decrypt)
  [`--backup-password-from-stdin`](mysql-cluster-programs-ndb-restore.md#option_ndb_restore_backup-password-from-stdin)
- [**ndbxfrm**](mysql-cluster-programs-ndbxfrm.md "25.5.31 ndbxfrm — Compress, Decompress, Encrypt, and Decrypt Files Created by NDB Cluster")
  [`--decrypt-password-from-stdin`](mysql-cluster-programs-ndbxfrm.md#option_ndbxfrm_decrypt-password-from-stdin)
  *`input_file`*
  *`output_file`*
- [**ndb\_print\_backup\_file**](mysql-cluster-programs-ndb-print-backup-file.md "25.5.17 ndb_print_backup_file — Print NDB Backup File Contents")
  [`--backup-password=password`](mysql-cluster-programs-ndb-print-backup-file.md#option_ndb_print_backup_file_backup-password)
  *`file_name`*
- [**ndb\_print\_backup\_file**](mysql-cluster-programs-ndb-print-backup-file.md "25.5.17 ndb_print_backup_file — Print NDB Backup File Contents")
  [`--backup-password-from-stdin`](mysql-cluster-programs-ndb-print-backup-file.md#option_ndb_print_backup_file_backup-password-from-stdin)
  *`file_name`*
- [**ndb\_mgm**](mysql-cluster-programs-ndb-mgm.md "25.5.5 ndb_mgm — The NDB Cluster Management Client")
  [`--backup-password-from-stdin`](mysql-cluster-programs-ndb-mgm.md#option_ndb_mgm_backup-password-from-stdin)
  [`--execute "START BACKUP ..."`](mysql-cluster-programs-ndb-mgm.md#option_ndb_mgm_execute)

See the descriptions of these programs for more information,
such as additional options that may be required.

The *`wait_option`* can be used to
determine when control is returned to the management client
after a `START BACKUP` command is issued, as
shown in the following list:

- If `NOWAIT` is specified, the management
  client displays a prompt immediately, as seen here:

  ```ndbmgm
  ndb_mgm> START BACKUP NOWAIT
  ndb_mgm>
  ```

  In this case, the management client can be used even while
  it prints progress information from the backup process.
- With `WAIT STARTED` the management client
  waits until the backup has started before returning control
  to the user, as shown here:

  ```ndbmgm
  ndb_mgm> START BACKUP WAIT STARTED
  Waiting for started, this may take several minutes
  Node 2: Backup 3 started from node 1
  ndb_mgm>
  ```
- **`WAIT COMPLETED`** causes the management
  client to wait until the backup process is complete before
  returning control to the user.

`WAIT COMPLETED` is the default.

A *`snapshot_option`* can be used to
determine whether the backup matches the state of the cluster
when `START BACKUP` was issued, or when it was
completed. `SNAPSHOTSTART` causes the backup to
match the state of the cluster when the backup began;
`SNAPSHOTEND` causes the backup to reflect the
state of the cluster when the backup was finished.
`SNAPSHOTEND` is the default, and matches the
behavior found in previous NDB Cluster releases.

Note

If you use the `SNAPSHOTSTART` option with
`START BACKUP`, and the
[`CompressedBackup`](mysql-cluster-ndbd-definition.md#ndbparam-ndbd-compressedbackup)
parameter is enabled, only the data and control files are
compressed—the log file is not compressed.

If both a *`wait_option`* and a
*`snapshot_option`* are used, they may be
specified in either order. For example, all of the following
commands are valid, assuming that there is no existing backup
having 4 as its ID:

```simple
START BACKUP WAIT STARTED SNAPSHOTSTART
START BACKUP SNAPSHOTSTART WAIT STARTED
START BACKUP 4 WAIT COMPLETED SNAPSHOTSTART
START BACKUP SNAPSHOTEND WAIT COMPLETED
START BACKUP 4 NOWAIT SNAPSHOTSTART
```

The procedure for creating a backup consists of the following
steps:

1. Start the management client ([**ndb\_mgm**](mysql-cluster-programs-ndb-mgm.md "25.5.5 ndb_mgm — The NDB Cluster Management Client")), if
   it not running already.
2. Execute the **`START BACKUP`** command.
   This produces several lines of output indicating the
   progress of the backup, as shown here:

   ```ndbmgm
   ndb_mgm> START BACKUP
   Waiting for completed, this may take several minutes
   Node 2: Backup 1 started from node 1
   Node 2: Backup 1 started from node 1 completed
    StartGCP: 177 StopGCP: 180
    #Records: 7362 #LogRecords: 0
    Data: 453648 bytes Log: 0 bytes
   ndb_mgm>
   ```
3. When the backup has started the management client displays
   this message:

   ```ndbmgm
   Backup backup_id started from node node_id
   ```

   *`backup_id`* is the unique
   identifier for this particular backup. This identifier is
   saved in the cluster log, if it has not been configured
   otherwise. *`node_id`* is the
   identifier of the management server that is coordinating the
   backup with the data nodes. At this point in the backup
   process the cluster has received and processed the backup
   request. It does not mean that the backup has finished. An
   example of this statement is shown here:

   ```ndbmgm
   Node 2: Backup 1 started from node 1
   ```
4. The management client indicates with a message like this one
   that the backup has started:

   ```ndbmgm
   Backup backup_id started from node node_id completed
   ```

   As is the case for the notification that the backup has
   started, *`backup_id`* is the unique
   identifier for this particular backup, and
   *`node_id`* is the node ID of the
   management server that is coordinating the backup with the
   data nodes. This output is accompanied by additional
   information including relevant global checkpoints, the
   number of records backed up, and the size of the data, as
   shown here:

   ```ndbmgm
   Node 2: Backup 1 started from node 1 completed
    StartGCP: 177 StopGCP: 180
    #Records: 7362 #LogRecords: 0
    Data: 453648 bytes Log: 0 bytes
   ```

It is also possible to perform a backup from the system shell by
invoking [**ndb\_mgm**](mysql-cluster-programs-ndb-mgm.md "25.5.5 ndb_mgm — The NDB Cluster Management Client") with the `-e`
or [`--execute`](mysql-cluster-programs-ndb-mgm.md#option_ndb_mgm_execute) option, as shown in
this example:

```terminal
$> ndb_mgm -e "START BACKUP 6 WAIT COMPLETED SNAPSHOTSTART"
```

When using `START BACKUP` in this way, you must
specify the backup ID.

Cluster backups are created by default in the
`BACKUP` subdirectory of the
[`DataDir`](mysql-cluster-ndbd-definition.md#ndbparam-ndbd-datadir) on each data
node. This can be overridden for one or more data nodes
individually, or for all cluster data nodes in the
`config.ini` file using the
[`BackupDataDir`](mysql-cluster-ndbd-definition.md#ndbparam-ndbd-backupdatadir)
configuration parameter. The backup files created for a backup
with a given *`backup_id`* are stored in
a subdirectory named
`BACKUP-backup_id`
in the backup directory.

**Cancelling backups.**
To cancel or abort a backup that is already in progress,
perform the following steps:

1. Start the management client.
2. Execute this command:

   ```ndbmgm
   ndb_mgm> ABORT BACKUP backup_id
   ```

   The number *`backup_id`* is the
   identifier of the backup that was included in the response
   of the management client when the backup was started (in the
   message `Backup backup_id
   started from node
   management_node_id`).
3. The management client acknowledges the abort request with
   `Abort of backup
   backup_id ordered`.

   Note

   At this point, the management client has not yet received
   a response from the cluster data nodes to this request,
   and the backup has not yet actually been aborted.
4. After the backup has been aborted, the management client
   reports this fact in a manner similar to what is shown here:

   ```ndbmgm
   Node 1: Backup 3 started from 5 has been aborted.
     Error: 1321 - Backup aborted by user request: Permanent error: User defined error
   Node 3: Backup 3 started from 5 has been aborted.
     Error: 1323 - 1323: Permanent error: Internal error
   Node 2: Backup 3 started from 5 has been aborted.
     Error: 1323 - 1323: Permanent error: Internal error
   Node 4: Backup 3 started from 5 has been aborted.
     Error: 1323 - 1323: Permanent error: Internal error
   ```

   In this example, we have shown sample output for a cluster
   with 4 data nodes, where the sequence number of the backup
   to be aborted is `3`, and the management
   node to which the cluster management client is connected has
   the node ID `5`. The first node to complete
   its part in aborting the backup reports that the reason for
   the abort was due to a request by the user. (The remaining
   nodes report that the backup was aborted due to an
   unspecified internal error.)

   Note

   There is no guarantee that the cluster nodes respond to an
   `ABORT BACKUP` command in any particular
   order.

   The `Backup backup_id
   started from node
   management_node_id has been
   aborted` messages mean that the backup has been
   terminated and that all files relating to this backup have
   been removed from the cluster file system.

It is also possible to abort a backup in progress from a system
shell using this command:

```terminal
$> ndb_mgm -e "ABORT BACKUP backup_id"
```

Note

If there is no backup having the ID
*`backup_id`* running when an
`ABORT BACKUP` is issued, the management
client makes no response, nor is it indicated in the cluster
log that an invalid abort command was sent.
