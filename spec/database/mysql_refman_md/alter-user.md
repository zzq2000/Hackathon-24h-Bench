The [`ALTER USER`](alter-user.md "15.7.1.1 ALTER USER Statement") statement modifies
MySQL accounts. It enables authentication, role, SSL/TLS,
resource-limit, password-management, comment, and attribute
properties to be modified for existing accounts. It can also be
used to lock and unlock accounts.

In most cases, [`ALTER USER`](alter-user.md "15.7.1.1 ALTER USER Statement")
requires the global [`CREATE USER`](privileges-provided.md#priv_create-user)
privilege, or the [`UPDATE`](privileges-provided.md#priv_update)
privilege for the `mysql` system schema. The
exceptions are:

- Any client who connects to the server using a nonanonymous
  account can change the password for that account. (In
  particular, you can change your own password.) To see which
  account the server authenticated you as, invoke the
  [`CURRENT_USER()`](information-functions.md#function_current-user) function:

  ```sql
  SELECT CURRENT_USER();
  ```
- For `DEFAULT ROLE` syntax,
  [`ALTER USER`](alter-user.md "15.7.1.1 ALTER USER Statement") requires these
  privileges:

  - Setting the default roles for another user requires the
    global [`CREATE USER`](privileges-provided.md#priv_create-user)
    privilege, or the [`UPDATE`](privileges-provided.md#priv_update)
    privilege for the `mysql.default_roles`
    system table.
  - Setting the default roles for yourself requires no
    special privileges, as long as the roles you want as the
    default have been granted to you.
- Statements that modify secondary passwords require these
  privileges:

  - The
    [`APPLICATION_PASSWORD_ADMIN`](privileges-provided.md#priv_application-password-admin)
    privilege is required to use the `RETAIN CURRENT
    PASSWORD` or `DISCARD OLD
    PASSWORD` clause for [`ALTER
    USER`](alter-user.md "15.7.1.1 ALTER USER Statement") statements that apply to your own
    account. The privilege is required to manipulate your
    own secondary password because most users require only
    one password.
  - If an account is to be permitted to manipulate secondary
    passwords for all accounts, it requires the
    [`CREATE USER`](privileges-provided.md#priv_create-user) privilege
    rather than
    [`APPLICATION_PASSWORD_ADMIN`](privileges-provided.md#priv_application-password-admin).

When the [`read_only`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_read_only) system
variable is enabled, [`ALTER USER`](alter-user.md "15.7.1.1 ALTER USER Statement")
additionally requires the
[`CONNECTION_ADMIN`](privileges-provided.md#priv_connection-admin) privilege (or
the deprecated [`SUPER`](privileges-provided.md#priv_super) privilege).

As of MySQL 8.0.27, these additional privilege considerations
apply:

- The [`authentication_policy`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_authentication_policy)
  system variable places certain constraints on how the
  authentication-related clauses of [`ALTER
  USER`](alter-user.md "15.7.1.1 ALTER USER Statement") statements may be used; for details, see the
  description of that variable. These constraints do not apply
  if you have the
  [`AUTHENTICATION_POLICY_ADMIN`](privileges-provided.md#priv_authentication-policy-admin)
  privilege.
- To modify an account that uses passwordless authentication,
  you must have the
  [`PASSWORDLESS_USER_ADMIN`](privileges-provided.md#priv_passwordless-user-admin)
  privilege.

By default, an error occurs if you try to modify a user that
does not exist. If the `IF EXISTS` clause is
given, the statement produces a warning for each named user that
does not exist, rather than an error.

Important

Under some circumstances, [`ALTER
USER`](alter-user.md "15.7.1.1 ALTER USER Statement") may be recorded in server logs or on the client
side in a history file such as
`~/.mysql_history`, which means that
cleartext passwords may be read by anyone having read access
to that information. For information about the conditions
under which this occurs for the server logs and how to control
it, see [Section 8.1.2.3, “Passwords and Logging”](password-logging.md "8.1.2.3 Passwords and Logging"). For similar
information about client-side logging, see
[Section 6.5.1.3, “mysql Client Logging”](mysql-logging.md "6.5.1.3 mysql Client Logging").

There are several aspects to the [`ALTER
USER`](alter-user.md "15.7.1.1 ALTER USER Statement") statement, described under the following topics:

- [ALTER USER Overview](alter-user.md#alter-user-overview "ALTER USER Overview")
- [ALTER USER Authentication Options](alter-user.md#alter-user-authentication "ALTER USER Authentication Options")
- [ALTER USER Multifactor Authentication Options](alter-user.md#alter-user-multifactor-authentication "ALTER USER Multifactor Authentication Options")
- [ALTER USER Registration Options](alter-user.md#alter-user-registration- "ALTER USER Registration Options")
- [ALTER USER Role Options](alter-user.md#alter-user-role "ALTER USER Role Options")
- [ALTER USER SSL/TLS Options](alter-user.md#alter-user-tls "ALTER USER SSL/TLS Options")
- [ALTER USER Resource-Limit Options](alter-user.md#alter-user-resource-limits "ALTER USER Resource-Limit Options")
- [ALTER USER Password-Management Options](alter-user.md#alter-user-password-management "ALTER USER Password-Management Options")
- [ALTER USER Comment and Attribute Options](alter-user.md#alter-user-comments-attributes "ALTER USER Comment and Attribute Options")
- [ALTER USER Account-Locking Options](alter-user.md#alter-user-account-locking "ALTER USER Account-Locking Options")
- [ALTER USER Binary Logging](alter-user.md#alter-user-binary-logging "ALTER USER Binary Logging")

##### ALTER USER Overview

For each affected account, [`ALTER
USER`](alter-user.md "15.7.1.1 ALTER USER Statement") modifies the corresponding row in the
`mysql.user` system table to reflect the
properties specified in the statement. Unspecified properties
retain their current values.

Each account name uses the format described in
[Section 8.2.4, “Specifying Account Names”](account-names.md "8.2.4 Specifying Account Names"). The host name part of the
account name, if omitted, defaults to `'%'`.
It is also possible to specify
[`CURRENT_USER`](information-functions.md#function_current-user) or
[`CURRENT_USER()`](information-functions.md#function_current-user) to refer to the
account associated with the current session.

In one case only, the account may be specified with the
[`USER()`](information-functions.md#function_user) function:

```sql
ALTER USER USER() IDENTIFIED BY 'auth_string';
```

This syntax enables changing your own password without naming
your account literally. (The syntax also supports the
`REPLACE`, `RETAIN CURRENT
PASSWORD`, and `DISCARD OLD
PASSWORD` clauses described at
[ALTER USER Authentication Options](alter-user.md#alter-user-authentication "ALTER USER Authentication Options").)

For [`ALTER USER`](alter-user.md "15.7.1.1 ALTER USER Statement") syntax that
permits an *`auth_option`* value to
follow a *`user`* value,
*`auth_option`* indicates how the
account authenticates by specifying an account authentication
plugin, credentials (for example, a password), or both. Each
*`auth_option`* value applies
*only* to the account named immediately
preceding it.

Following the *`user`* specifications,
the statement may include options for SSL/TLS, resource-limit,
password-management, and locking properties. All such options
are *global* to the statement and apply to
*all* accounts named in the statement.

Example: Change an account's password and expire it. As a
result, the user must connect with the named password and
choose a new one at the next connection:

```sql
ALTER USER 'jeffrey'@'localhost'
  IDENTIFIED BY 'new_password' PASSWORD EXPIRE;
```

Example: Modify an account to use the
`caching_sha2_password` authentication plugin
and the given password. Require that a new password be chosen
every 180 days, and enable failed-login tracking, such that
three consecutive incorrect passwords cause temporary account
locking for two days:

```sql
ALTER USER 'jeffrey'@'localhost'
  IDENTIFIED WITH caching_sha2_password BY 'new_password'
  PASSWORD EXPIRE INTERVAL 180 DAY
  FAILED_LOGIN_ATTEMPTS 3 PASSWORD_LOCK_TIME 2;
```

Example: Lock or unlock an account:

```sql
ALTER USER 'jeffrey'@'localhost' ACCOUNT LOCK;
ALTER USER 'jeffrey'@'localhost' ACCOUNT UNLOCK;
```

Example: Require an account to connect using SSL and establish
a limit of 20 connections per hour:

```sql
ALTER USER 'jeffrey'@'localhost'
  REQUIRE SSL WITH MAX_CONNECTIONS_PER_HOUR 20;
```

Example: Alter multiple accounts, specifying some per-account
properties and some global properties:

```sql
ALTER USER
  'jeffrey'@'localhost'
    IDENTIFIED BY 'jeffrey_new_password',
  'jeanne'@'localhost',
  'josh'@'localhost'
    IDENTIFIED BY 'josh_new_password'
    REPLACE 'josh_current_password'
    RETAIN CURRENT PASSWORD
  REQUIRE SSL WITH MAX_USER_CONNECTIONS 2
  PASSWORD HISTORY 5;
```

The `IDENTIFIED BY` value following
`jeffrey` applies only to its immediately
preceding account, so it changes the password to
`'jeffrey_new_password'`
only for `jeffrey`. For
`jeanne`, there is no per-account value (thus
leaving the password unchanged). For `josh`,
`IDENTIFIED BY` establishes a new password
(`'josh_new_password'`),
`REPLACE` is specified to verify that the
user issuing the [`ALTER USER`](alter-user.md "15.7.1.1 ALTER USER Statement")
statement knows the current password
(`'josh_current_password'`),
and that current password is also retained as the account
secondary password. (As a result, `josh` can
connect with either the primary or secondary password.)

The remaining properties apply globally to all accounts named
in the statement, so for both accounts:

- Connections are required to use SSL.
- The account can be used for a maximum of two simultaneous
  connections.
- Password changes cannot reuse any of the five most recent
  passwords.

Example: Discard the secondary password for
`josh`, leaving the account with only its
primary password:

```sql
ALTER USER 'josh'@'localhost' DISCARD OLD PASSWORD;
```

In the absence of a particular type of option, the account
remains unchanged in that respect. For example, with no
locking option, the locking state of the account is not
changed.

##### ALTER USER Authentication Options

An account name may be followed by an
*`auth_option`* authentication option
that specifies the account authentication plugin, credentials,
or both. It may also include a password-verification clause
that specifies the account current password to be replaced,
and clauses that manage whether an account has a secondary
password.

Note

Clauses for random password generation, password
verification, and secondary passwords apply only to accounts
that use an authentication plugin that stores credentials
internally to MySQL. For accounts that use a plugin that
performs authentication against a credentials system that is
external to MySQL, password management must be handled
externally against that system as well. For more information
about internal credentials storage, see
[Section 8.2.15, “Password Management”](password-management.md "8.2.15 Password Management").

- *`auth_plugin`* names an
  authentication plugin. The plugin name can be a quoted
  string literal or an unquoted name. Plugin names are
  stored in the `plugin` column of the
  `mysql.user` system table.

  For *`auth_option`* syntax that
  does not specify an authentication plugin, the server
  assigns the default plugin, determined as described in
  [The Default Authentication Plugin](pluggable-authentication.md#pluggable-authentication-default-plugin "The Default Authentication Plugin").
  For descriptions of each plugin, see
  [Section 8.4.1, “Authentication Plugins”](authentication-plugins.md "8.4.1 Authentication Plugins").
- Credentials that are stored internally are stored in the
  `mysql.user` system table. An
  `'auth_string'`
  value or `RANDOM PASSWORD` specifies
  account credentials, either as a cleartext (unencrypted)
  string or hashed in the format expected by the
  authentication plugin associated with the account,
  respectively:

  - For syntax that uses `BY
    'auth_string'`,
    the string is cleartext and is passed to the
    authentication plugin for possible hashing. The result
    returned by the plugin is stored in the
    `mysql.user` table. A plugin may use
    the value as specified, in which case no hashing
    occurs.
  - For syntax that uses `BY RANDOM
    PASSWORD`, MySQL generates a random password
    and as cleartext and passes it to the authentication
    plugin for possible hashing. The result returned by
    the plugin is stored in the
    `mysql.user` table. A plugin may use
    the value as specified, in which case no hashing
    occurs.

    Randomly generated passwords are available as of MySQL
    8.0.18 and have the characteristics described in
    [Random Password Generation](password-management.md#random-password-generation "Random Password Generation").
  - For syntax that uses `AS
    'auth_string'`,
    the string is assumed to be already in the format the
    authentication plugin requires, and is stored as is in
    the `mysql.user` table. If a plugin
    requires a hashed value, the value must be already
    hashed in a format appropriate for the plugin;
    otherwise, the value cannot be used by the plugin and
    correct authentication of client connections does not
    occur.

    As of MySQL 8.0.17, a hashed string can be either a
    string literal or a hexadecimal value. The latter
    corresponds to the type of value displayed by
    [`SHOW CREATE USER`](show-create-user.md "15.7.7.12 SHOW CREATE USER Statement") for
    password hashes containing unprintable characters when
    the
    [`print_identified_with_as_hex`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_print_identified_with_as_hex)
    system variable is enabled.
  - If an authentication plugin performs no hashing of the
    authentication string, the `BY
    'auth_string'` and
    `AS
    'auth_string'`
    clauses have the same effect: The authentication
    string is stored as is in the
    `mysql.user` system table.
- The `REPLACE
  'current_auth_string'`
  clause performs password verification and is available as
  of MySQL 8.0.13. If given:

  - `REPLACE` specifies the account
    current password to be replaced, as a cleartext
    (unencrypted) string.
  - The clause must be given if password changes for the
    account are required to specify the current password,
    as verification that the user attempting to make the
    change actually knows the current password.
  - The clause is optional if password changes for the
    account may but need not specify the current password.
  - The statement fails if the clause is given but does
    not match the current password, even if the clause is
    optional.
  - `REPLACE` can be specified only when
    changing the account password for the current user.

  For more information about password verification by
  specifying the current password, see
  [Section 8.2.15, “Password Management”](password-management.md "8.2.15 Password Management").
- The `RETAIN CURRENT PASSWORD` and
  `DISCARD OLD PASSWORD` clauses implement
  dual-password capability and are available as of MySQL
  8.0.14. Both are optional, but if given, have the
  following effects:

  - `RETAIN CURRENT PASSWORD` retains an
    account current password as its secondary password,
    replacing any existing secondary password. The new
    password becomes the primary password, but clients can
    use the account to connect to the server using either
    the primary or secondary password. (Exception: If the
    new password specified by the
    [`ALTER USER`](alter-user.md "15.7.1.1 ALTER USER Statement") statement is
    empty, the secondary password becomes empty as well,
    even if `RETAIN CURRENT PASSWORD` is
    given.)
  - If you specify `RETAIN CURRENT
    PASSWORD` for an account that has an empty
    primary password, the statement fails.
  - If an account has a secondary password and you change
    its primary password without specifying
    `RETAIN CURRENT PASSWORD`, the
    secondary password remains unchanged.
  - If you change the authentication plugin assigned to
    the account, the secondary password is discarded. If
    you change the authentication plugin and also specify
    `RETAIN CURRENT PASSWORD`, the
    statement fails.
  - `DISCARD OLD PASSWORD` discards the
    secondary password, if one exists. The account retains
    only its primary password, and clients can use the
    account to connect to the server only with the primary
    password.

  For more information about use of dual passwords, see
  [Section 8.2.15, “Password Management”](password-management.md "8.2.15 Password Management").

[`ALTER USER`](alter-user.md "15.7.1.1 ALTER USER Statement") permits these
*`auth_option`* syntaxes:

- `IDENTIFIED BY
  'auth_string' [REPLACE
  'current_auth_string'] [RETAIN
  CURRENT PASSWORD]`

  Sets the account authentication plugin to the default
  plugin, passes the cleartext
  `'auth_string'`
  value to the plugin for possible hashing, and stores the
  result in the account row in the
  `mysql.user` system table.

  The `REPLACE` clause, if given, specifies
  the account current password, as described previously in
  this section.

  The `RETAIN CURRENT PASSWORD` clause, if
  given, causes the account current password to be retained
  as its secondary password, as described previously in this
  section.
- `IDENTIFIED BY RANDOM PASSWORD [REPLACE
  'current_auth_string'] [RETAIN
  CURRENT PASSWORD]`

  Sets the account authentication plugin to the default
  plugin, generates a random password, passes the cleartext
  password value to the plugin for possible hashing, and
  stores the result in the account row in the
  `mysql.user` system table. The statement
  also returns the cleartext password in a result set to
  make it available to the user or application executing the
  statement. For details about the result set and
  characteristics of randomly generated passwords, see
  [Random Password Generation](password-management.md#random-password-generation "Random Password Generation").

  The `REPLACE` clause, if given, specifies
  the account current password, as described previously in
  this section.

  The `RETAIN CURRENT PASSWORD` clause, if
  given, causes the account current password to be retained
  as its secondary password, as described previously in this
  section.
- `IDENTIFIED WITH
  auth_plugin`

  Sets the account authentication plugin to
  *`auth_plugin`*, clears the
  credentials to the empty string (the credentials are
  associated with the old authentication plugin, not the new
  one), and stores the result in the account row in the
  `mysql.user` system table.

  In addition, the password is marked expired. The user must
  choose a new one when next connecting.
- `IDENTIFIED WITH
  auth_plugin BY
  'auth_string' [REPLACE
  'current_auth_string'] [RETAIN
  CURRENT PASSWORD]`

  Sets the account authentication plugin to
  *`auth_plugin`*, passes the
  cleartext
  `'auth_string'`
  value to the plugin for possible hashing, and stores the
  result in the account row in the
  `mysql.user` system table.

  The `REPLACE` clause, if given, specifies
  the account current password, as described previously in
  this section.

  The `RETAIN CURRENT PASSWORD` clause, if
  given, causes the account current password to be retained
  as its secondary password, as described previously in this
  section.
- `IDENTIFIED WITH
  auth_plugin BY RANDOM PASSWORD
  [REPLACE 'current_auth_string']
  [RETAIN CURRENT PASSWORD]`

  Sets the account authentication plugin to
  *`auth_plugin`*, generates a random
  password, passes the cleartext password value to the
  plugin for possible hashing, and stores the result in the
  account row in the `mysql.user` system
  table. The statement also returns the cleartext password
  in a result set to make it available to the user or
  application executing the statement. For details about the
  result set and characteristics of randomly generated
  passwords, see
  [Random Password Generation](password-management.md#random-password-generation "Random Password Generation").

  The `REPLACE` clause, if given, specifies
  the account current password, as described previously in
  this section.

  The `RETAIN CURRENT PASSWORD` clause, if
  given, causes the account current password to be retained
  as its secondary password, as described previously in this
  section.
- `IDENTIFIED WITH
  auth_plugin AS
  'auth_string'`

  Sets the account authentication plugin to
  *`auth_plugin`* and stores the
  `'auth_string'`
  value as is in the `mysql.user` account
  row. If the plugin requires a hashed string, the string is
  assumed to be already hashed in the format the plugin
  requires.
- `DISCARD OLD PASSWORD`

  Discards the account secondary password, if there is one,
  as described previously in this section.

Example: Specify the password as cleartext; the default plugin
is used:

```sql
ALTER USER 'jeffrey'@'localhost'
  IDENTIFIED BY 'password';
```

Example: Specify the authentication plugin, along with a
cleartext password value:

```sql
ALTER USER 'jeffrey'@'localhost'
  IDENTIFIED WITH mysql_native_password
             BY 'password';
```

Example: Like the preceding example, but in addition, specify
the current password as a cleartext value to satisfy any
account requirement that the user making the change knows that
password:

```sql
ALTER USER 'jeffrey'@'localhost'
  IDENTIFIED WITH mysql_native_password
             BY 'password'
             REPLACE 'current_password';
```

The preceding statement fails unless the current user is
`jeffrey` because `REPLACE`
is permitted only for changes to the current user's password.

Example: Establish a new primary password and retain the
existing password as the secondary password:

```sql
ALTER USER 'jeffrey'@'localhost'
  IDENTIFIED BY 'new_password'
  RETAIN CURRENT PASSWORD;
```

Example: Discard the secondary password, leaving the account
with only its primary password:

```sql
ALTER USER 'jeffery'@'localhost' DISCARD OLD PASSWORD;
```

Example: Specify the authentication plugin, along with a
hashed password value:

```sql
ALTER USER 'jeffrey'@'localhost'
  IDENTIFIED WITH mysql_native_password
             AS '*6C8989366EAF75BB670AD8EA7A7FC1176A95CEF4';
```

For additional information about setting passwords and
authentication plugins, see
[Section 8.2.14, “Assigning Account Passwords”](assigning-passwords.md "8.2.14 Assigning Account Passwords"), and
[Section 8.2.17, “Pluggable Authentication”](pluggable-authentication.md "8.2.17 Pluggable Authentication").

##### ALTER USER Multifactor Authentication Options

As of MySQL 8.0.27, [`ALTER USER`](alter-user.md "15.7.1.1 ALTER USER Statement")
has `ADD`, `MODIFY`, and
`DROP` clauses that enable authentication
factors to be added, modified, or dropped. In each case, the
clause specifies an operation to perform on one authentication
factor, and optionally an operation on another authentication
factor. For each operation, the
*`factor`* item specifies the
`FACTOR` keyword preceded by the number 2 or
3 to indicate whether the operation applies to the second or
third authentication factor. (1 is not permitted in this
context. To act on the first authentication factor, use the
syntax described in
[ALTER USER Authentication Options](alter-user.md#alter-user-authentication "ALTER USER Authentication Options").)

[`ALTER USER`](alter-user.md "15.7.1.1 ALTER USER Statement") multifactor
authentication clause constraints are defined by the
[`authentication_policy`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_authentication_policy) system
variable. For example, the
[`authentication_policy`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_authentication_policy) setting
controls the number of authentication factors that accounts
may have, and for each factor, which authentication methods
are permitted. See
[Configuring the Multifactor Authentication Policy](multifactor-authentication.md#multifactor-authentication-policy "Configuring the Multifactor Authentication Policy").

When [`ALTER USER`](alter-user.md "15.7.1.1 ALTER USER Statement") adds, modifies,
or drops second and third factors in a single statement,
operations are executed sequentially, but if any operation in
the sequence fails the entire [`ALTER
USER`](alter-user.md "15.7.1.1 ALTER USER Statement") statement fails.

For `ADD`, each named factor must not already
exist or it cannot be added. For `MODIFY` and
`DROP`, each named factor must exist to be
modified or dropped. If a second and third factor are defined,
dropping the second factor causes the third factor to take its
place as the second factor.

This statement drops authentication factors 2 and 3, which has
the effect of converting the account from 3FA to 1FA:

```sql
ALTER USER 'user' DROP 2 FACTOR 3 FACTOR;
```

For additional `ADD`,
`MODIFY`, and `DROP`
examples, see
[Getting Started with Multifactor Authentication](multifactor-authentication.md#multifactor-authentication-getting-started "Getting Started with Multifactor Authentication").

For information about factor-specific rules that determine the
default authentication plugin for authentication clauses that
do not name a plugin, see
[The Default Authentication Plugin](pluggable-authentication.md#pluggable-authentication-default-plugin "The Default Authentication Plugin").

##### ALTER USER Registration Options

As of MySQL 8.0.27, [`ALTER USER`](alter-user.md "15.7.1.1 ALTER USER Statement")
has clauses that enable FIDO devices to be registered and
unregistered. For more information, see
[Using FIDO Authentication](fido-pluggable-authentication.md#fido-pluggable-authentication-usage "Using FIDO Authentication"),
[FIDO Device Unregistration](fido-pluggable-authentication.md#fido-pluggable-authentication-unregistration "FIDO Device Unregistration"),
and the [**mysql**](mysql.md "6.5.1 mysql — The MySQL Command-Line Client") client
[`--fido-register-factor`](mysql-command-options.md#option_mysql_fido-register-factor) option
description.

The [**mysql**](mysql.md "6.5.1 mysql — The MySQL Command-Line Client") client
[`--fido-register-factor`](mysql-command-options.md#option_mysql_fido-register-factor) option,
used for FIDO device registration, causes the
[**mysql**](mysql.md "6.5.1 mysql — The MySQL Command-Line Client") client to generate and execute
`INITIATE REGISTRATION` and `FINISH
REGISTRATION` statements. These statements are not
intended for manual execution.

##### ALTER USER Role Options

[`ALTER USER ...
DEFAULT ROLE`](alter-user.md "15.7.1.1 ALTER USER Statement") defines which roles become active when
the user connects to the server and authenticates, or when the
user executes the
[`SET ROLE
DEFAULT`](set-role.md "15.7.1.11 SET ROLE Statement") statement during a session.

[`ALTER USER ...
DEFAULT ROLE`](alter-user.md "15.7.1.1 ALTER USER Statement") is alternative syntax for
[`SET DEFAULT ROLE`](set-default-role.md "15.7.1.9 SET DEFAULT ROLE Statement") (see
[Section 15.7.1.9, “SET DEFAULT ROLE Statement”](set-default-role.md "15.7.1.9 SET DEFAULT ROLE Statement")). However,
[`ALTER USER`](alter-user.md "15.7.1.1 ALTER USER Statement") can set the default
for only a single user, whereas [`SET
DEFAULT ROLE`](set-default-role.md "15.7.1.9 SET DEFAULT ROLE Statement") can set the default for multiple users.
On the other hand, you can specify
`CURRENT_USER` as the user name for the
[`ALTER USER`](alter-user.md "15.7.1.1 ALTER USER Statement") statement, whereas
you cannot for [`SET DEFAULT
ROLE`](set-default-role.md "15.7.1.9 SET DEFAULT ROLE Statement").

Each user account name uses the format described previously.

Each role name uses the format described in
[Section 8.2.5, “Specifying Role Names”](role-names.md "8.2.5 Specifying Role Names"). For example:

```sql
ALTER USER 'joe'@'10.0.0.1' DEFAULT ROLE administrator, developer;
```

The host name part of the role name, if omitted, defaults to
`'%'`.

The clause following the `DEFAULT ROLE`
keywords permits these values:

- `NONE`: Set the default to
  `NONE` (no roles).
- `ALL`: Set the default to all roles
  granted to the account.
- `role [,
  role ] ...`: Set the
  default to the named roles, which must exist and be
  granted to the account at the time
  [`ALTER USER ...
  DEFAULT ROLE`](alter-user.md "15.7.1.1 ALTER USER Statement") is executed.

##### ALTER USER SSL/TLS Options

MySQL can check X.509 certificate attributes in addition to
the usual authentication that is based on the user name and
credentials. For background information on the use of SSL/TLS
with MySQL, see [Section 8.3, “Using Encrypted Connections”](encrypted-connections.md "8.3 Using Encrypted Connections").

To specify SSL/TLS-related options for a MySQL account, use a
`REQUIRE` clause that specifies one or more
*`tls_option`* values.

Order of `REQUIRE` options does not matter,
but no option can be specified twice. The
`AND` keyword is optional between
`REQUIRE` options.

[`ALTER USER`](alter-user.md "15.7.1.1 ALTER USER Statement") permits these
*`tls_option`* values:

- `NONE`

  Indicates that all accounts named by the statement have no
  SSL or X.509 requirements. Unencrypted connections are
  permitted if the user name and password are valid.
  Encrypted connections can be used, at the client's option,
  if the client has the proper certificate and key files.

  ```sql
  ALTER USER 'jeffrey'@'localhost' REQUIRE NONE;
  ```

  Clients attempt to establish a secure connection by
  default. For clients that have `REQUIRE
  NONE`, the connection attempt falls back to an
  unencrypted connection if a secure connection cannot be
  established. To require an encrypted connection, a client
  need specify only the
  [`--ssl-mode=REQUIRED`](connection-options.md#option_general_ssl-mode)
  option; the connection attempt fails if a secure
  connection cannot be established.
- `SSL`

  Tells the server to permit only encrypted connections for
  all accounts named by the statement.

  ```sql
  ALTER USER 'jeffrey'@'localhost' REQUIRE SSL;
  ```

  Clients attempt to establish a secure connection by
  default. For accounts that have `REQUIRE
  SSL`, the connection attempt fails if a secure
  connection cannot be established.
- `X509`

  For all accounts named by the statement, requires that
  clients present a valid certificate, but the exact
  certificate, issuer, and subject do not matter. The only
  requirement is that it should be possible to verify its
  signature with one of the CA certificates. Use of X.509
  certificates always implies encryption, so the
  `SSL` option is unnecessary in this case.

  ```sql
  ALTER USER 'jeffrey'@'localhost' REQUIRE X509;
  ```

  For accounts with `REQUIRE X509`, clients
  must specify the [`--ssl-key`](connection-options.md#option_general_ssl-key)
  and [`--ssl-cert`](connection-options.md#option_general_ssl-cert) options to
  connect. (It is recommended but not required that
  [`--ssl-ca`](connection-options.md#option_general_ssl-ca) also be specified
  so that the public certificate provided by the server can
  be verified.) This is true for `ISSUER`
  and `SUBJECT` as well because those
  `REQUIRE` options imply the requirements
  of `X509`.
- `ISSUER
  'issuer'`

  For all accounts named by the statement, requires that
  clients present a valid X.509 certificate issued by CA
  `'issuer'`. If
  a client presents a certificate that is valid but has a
  different issuer, the server rejects the connection. Use
  of X.509 certificates always implies encryption, so the
  `SSL` option is unnecessary in this case.

  ```sql
  ALTER USER 'jeffrey'@'localhost'
    REQUIRE ISSUER '/C=SE/ST=Stockholm/L=Stockholm/
      O=MySQL/CN=CA/emailAddress=ca@example.com';
  ```

  Because `ISSUER` implies the requirements
  of `X509`, clients must specify the
  [`--ssl-key`](connection-options.md#option_general_ssl-key) and
  [`--ssl-cert`](connection-options.md#option_general_ssl-cert) options to
  connect. (It is recommended but not required that
  [`--ssl-ca`](connection-options.md#option_general_ssl-ca) also be specified
  so that the public certificate provided by the server can
  be verified.)
- `SUBJECT
  'subject'`

  For all accounts named by the statement, requires that
  clients present a valid X.509 certificate containing the
  subject *`subject`*. If a client
  presents a certificate that is valid but has a different
  subject, the server rejects the connection. Use of X.509
  certificates always implies encryption, so the
  `SSL` option is unnecessary in this case.

  ```sql
  ALTER USER 'jeffrey'@'localhost'
    REQUIRE SUBJECT '/C=SE/ST=Stockholm/L=Stockholm/
      O=MySQL demo client certificate/
      CN=client/emailAddress=client@example.com';
  ```

  MySQL does a simple string comparison of the
  `'subject'`
  value to the value in the certificate, so lettercase and
  component ordering must be given exactly as present in the
  certificate.

  Because `SUBJECT` implies the
  requirements of `X509`, clients must
  specify the [`--ssl-key`](connection-options.md#option_general_ssl-key) and
  [`--ssl-cert`](connection-options.md#option_general_ssl-cert) options to
  connect. (It is recommended but not required that
  [`--ssl-ca`](connection-options.md#option_general_ssl-ca) also be specified
  so that the public certificate provided by the server can
  be verified.)
- `CIPHER
  'cipher'`

  For all accounts named by the statement, requires a
  specific cipher method for encrypting connections. This
  option is needed to ensure that ciphers and key lengths of
  sufficient strength are used. Encryption can be weak if
  old algorithms using short encryption keys are used.

  ```sql
  ALTER USER 'jeffrey'@'localhost'
    REQUIRE CIPHER 'EDH-RSA-DES-CBC3-SHA';
  ```

The `SUBJECT`, `ISSUER`, and
`CIPHER` options can be combined in the
`REQUIRE` clause:

```sql
ALTER USER 'jeffrey'@'localhost'
  REQUIRE SUBJECT '/C=SE/ST=Stockholm/L=Stockholm/
    O=MySQL demo client certificate/
    CN=client/emailAddress=client@example.com'
  AND ISSUER '/C=SE/ST=Stockholm/L=Stockholm/
    O=MySQL/CN=CA/emailAddress=ca@example.com'
  AND CIPHER 'EDH-RSA-DES-CBC3-SHA';
```

##### ALTER USER Resource-Limit Options

It is possible to place limits on use of server resources by
an account, as discussed in [Section 8.2.21, “Setting Account Resource Limits”](user-resources.md "8.2.21 Setting Account Resource Limits").
To do so, use a `WITH` clause that specifies
one or more *`resource_option`* values.

Order of `WITH` options does not matter,
except that if a given resource limit is specified multiple
times, the last instance takes precedence.

[`ALTER USER`](alter-user.md "15.7.1.1 ALTER USER Statement") permits these
*`resource_option`* values:

- `MAX_QUERIES_PER_HOUR
  count`,
  `MAX_UPDATES_PER_HOUR
  count`,
  `MAX_CONNECTIONS_PER_HOUR
  count`

  For all accounts named by the statement, these options
  restrict how many queries, updates, and connections to the
  server are permitted to each account during any given
  one-hour period. If *`count`* is
  `0` (the default), this means that there
  is no limitation for the account.
- `MAX_USER_CONNECTIONS
  count`

  For all accounts named by the statement, restricts the
  maximum number of simultaneous connections to the server
  by each account. A nonzero
  *`count`* specifies the limit for
  the account explicitly. If
  *`count`* is `0`
  (the default), the server determines the number of
  simultaneous connections for the account from the global
  value of the
  [`max_user_connections`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_max_user_connections)
  system variable. If
  [`max_user_connections`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_max_user_connections) is
  also zero, there is no limit for the account.

Example:

```sql
ALTER USER 'jeffrey'@'localhost'
  WITH MAX_QUERIES_PER_HOUR 500 MAX_UPDATES_PER_HOUR 100;
```

##### ALTER USER Password-Management Options

[`ALTER USER`](alter-user.md "15.7.1.1 ALTER USER Statement") supports several
*`password_option`* values for password
management:

- Password expiration options: You can expire an account
  password manually and establish its password expiration
  policy. Policy options do not expire the password.
  Instead, they determine how the server applies automatic
  expiration to the account based on password age, which is
  assessed from the date and time of the most recent account
  password change.
- Password reuse options: You can restrict password reuse
  based on number of password changes, time elapsed, or
  both.
- Password verification-required options: You can indicate
  whether attempts to change an account password must
  specify the current password, as verification that the
  user attempting to make the change actually knows the
  current password.
- Incorrect-password failed-login tracking options: You can
  cause the server to track failed login attempts and
  temporarily lock accounts for which too many consecutive
  incorrect passwords are given. The required number of
  failures and the lock time are configurable.

This section describes the syntax for password-management
options. For information about establishing policy for
password management, see
[Section 8.2.15, “Password Management”](password-management.md "8.2.15 Password Management").

If multiple password-management options of a given type are
specified, the last one takes precedence. For example,
`PASSWORD EXPIRE DEFAULT PASSWORD EXPIRE
NEVER` is the same as `PASSWORD EXPIRE
NEVER`.

Note

Except for the options that pertain to failed-login
tracking, password-management options apply only to accounts
that use an authentication plugin that stores credentials
internally to MySQL. For accounts that use a plugin that
performs authentication against a credentials system that is
external to MySQL, password management must be handled
externally against that system as well. For more information
about internal credentials storage, see
[Section 8.2.15, “Password Management”](password-management.md "8.2.15 Password Management").

A client has an expired password if the account password was
expired manually or the password age is considered greater
than its permitted lifetime per the automatic expiration
policy. In this case, the server either disconnects the client
or restricts the operations permitted to it (see
[Section 8.2.16, “Server Handling of Expired Passwords”](expired-password-handling.md "8.2.16 Server Handling of Expired Passwords")). Operations
performed by a restricted client result in an error until the
user establishes a new account password.

Note

Although it is possible to “reset” an expired
password by setting it to its current value, it is
preferable, as a matter of good policy, to choose a
different password. DBAs can enforce non-reuse by
establishing an appropriate password-reuse policy. See
[Password Reuse Policy](password-management.md#password-reuse-policy "Password Reuse Policy").

[`ALTER USER`](alter-user.md "15.7.1.1 ALTER USER Statement") permits these
*`password_option`* values for
controlling password expiration:

- `PASSWORD EXPIRE`

  Immediately marks the password expired for all accounts
  named by the statement.

  ```sql
  ALTER USER 'jeffrey'@'localhost' PASSWORD EXPIRE;
  ```
- `PASSWORD EXPIRE DEFAULT`

  Sets all accounts named by the statement so that the
  global expiration policy applies, as specified by the
  [`default_password_lifetime`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_default_password_lifetime)
  system variable.

  ```sql
  ALTER USER 'jeffrey'@'localhost' PASSWORD EXPIRE DEFAULT;
  ```
- `PASSWORD EXPIRE NEVER`

  This expiration option overrides the global policy for all
  accounts named by the statement. For each, it disables
  password expiration so that the password never expires.

  ```sql
  ALTER USER 'jeffrey'@'localhost' PASSWORD EXPIRE NEVER;
  ```
- `PASSWORD EXPIRE INTERVAL
  N DAY`

  This expiration option overrides the global policy for all
  accounts named by the statement. For each, it sets the
  password lifetime to *`N`* days.
  The following statement requires the password to be
  changed every 180 days:

  ```sql
  ALTER USER 'jeffrey'@'localhost' PASSWORD EXPIRE INTERVAL 180 DAY;
  ```

[`ALTER USER`](alter-user.md "15.7.1.1 ALTER USER Statement") permits these
*`password_option`* values for
controlling reuse of previous passwords based on required
minimum number of password changes:

- `PASSWORD HISTORY DEFAULT`

  Sets all accounts named by the statement so that the
  global policy about password history length applies, to
  prohibit reuse of passwords before the number of changes
  specified by the
  [`password_history`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_password_history) system
  variable.

  ```sql
  ALTER USER 'jeffrey'@'localhost' PASSWORD HISTORY DEFAULT;
  ```
- `PASSWORD HISTORY
  N`

  This history-length option overrides the global policy for
  all accounts named by the statement. For each, it sets the
  password history length to *`N`*
  passwords, to prohibit reusing any of the
  *`N`* most recently chosen
  passwords. The following statement prohibits reuse of any
  of the previous 6 passwords:

  ```sql
  ALTER USER 'jeffrey'@'localhost' PASSWORD HISTORY 6;
  ```

[`ALTER USER`](alter-user.md "15.7.1.1 ALTER USER Statement") permits these
*`password_option`* values for
controlling reuse of previous passwords based on time elapsed:

- `PASSWORD REUSE INTERVAL DEFAULT`

  Sets all statements named by the account so that the
  global policy about time elapsed applies, to prohibit
  reuse of passwords newer than the number of days specified
  by the
  [`password_reuse_interval`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_password_reuse_interval)
  system variable.

  ```sql
  ALTER USER 'jeffrey'@'localhost' PASSWORD REUSE INTERVAL DEFAULT;
  ```
- `PASSWORD REUSE INTERVAL
  N DAY`

  This time-elapsed option overrides the global policy for
  all accounts named by the statement. For each, it sets the
  password reuse interval to *`N`*
  days, to prohibit reuse of passwords newer than that many
  days. The following statement prohibits password reuse for
  360 days:

  ```sql
  ALTER USER 'jeffrey'@'localhost' PASSWORD REUSE INTERVAL 360 DAY;
  ```

[`ALTER USER`](alter-user.md "15.7.1.1 ALTER USER Statement") permits these
*`password_option`* values for
controlling whether attempts to change an account password
must specify the current password, as verification that the
user attempting to make the change actually knows the current
password:

- `PASSWORD REQUIRE CURRENT`

  This verification option overrides the global policy for
  all accounts named by the statement. For each, it requires
  that password changes specify the current password.

  ```sql
  ALTER USER 'jeffrey'@'localhost' PASSWORD REQUIRE CURRENT;
  ```
- `PASSWORD REQUIRE CURRENT OPTIONAL`

  This verification option overrides the global policy for
  all accounts named by the statement. For each, it does not
  require that password changes specify the current
  password. (The current password may but need not be
  given.)

  ```sql
  ALTER USER 'jeffrey'@'localhost' PASSWORD REQUIRE CURRENT OPTIONAL;
  ```
- `PASSWORD REQUIRE CURRENT DEFAULT`

  Sets all statements named by the account so that the
  global policy about password verification applies, as
  specified by the
  [`password_require_current`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_password_require_current)
  system variable.

  ```sql
  ALTER USER 'jeffrey'@'localhost' PASSWORD REQUIRE CURRENT DEFAULT;
  ```

As of MySQL 8.0.19, [`ALTER USER`](alter-user.md "15.7.1.1 ALTER USER Statement")
permits these *`password_option`*
values for controlling failed-login tracking:

- `FAILED_LOGIN_ATTEMPTS
  N`

  Whether to track account login attempts that specify an
  incorrect password. *`N`* must be a
  number from 0 to 32767. A value of 0 disables failed-login
  tracking. Values greater than 0 indicate how many
  consecutive password failures cause temporary account
  locking (if `PASSWORD_LOCK_TIME` is also
  nonzero).
- `PASSWORD_LOCK_TIME {N
  | UNBOUNDED}`

  How long to lock the account after too many consecutive
  login attempts provide an incorrect password.
  *`N`* must be a number from 0 to
  32767, or `UNBOUNDED`. A value of 0
  disables temporary account locking. Values greater than 0
  indicate how long to lock the account in days. A value of
  `UNBOUNDED` causes the account locking
  duration to be unbounded; once locked, the account remains
  in a locked state until unlocked. For information about
  the conditions under which unlocking occurs, see
  [Failed-Login Tracking and Temporary Account Locking](password-management.md#failed-login-tracking "Failed-Login Tracking and Temporary Account Locking").

For failed-login tracking and temporary locking to occur, an
account's `FAILED_LOGIN_ATTEMPTS` and
`PASSWORD_LOCK_TIME` options both must be
nonzero. The following statement modifies an account such that
it remains locked for two days after four consecutive password
failures:

```sql
ALTER USER 'jeffrey'@'localhost'
  FAILED_LOGIN_ATTEMPTS 4 PASSWORD_LOCK_TIME 2;
```

##### ALTER USER Comment and Attribute Options

MySQL 8.0.21 and higher supports user comments and user
attributes, as described in [Section 15.7.1.3, “CREATE USER Statement”](create-user.md "15.7.1.3 CREATE USER Statement").
These can be modified employing `ALTER USER`
by means of the `COMMENT` and
`ATTRIBUTE` options, respectively. You cannot
specify both options in the same `ALTER USER`
statement; attempting to do so results in a syntax error.

The user comment and user attribute are stored in the
Information Schema
[`USER_ATTRIBUTES`](information-schema-user-attributes-table.md "28.3.46 The INFORMATION_SCHEMA USER_ATTRIBUTES Table") table as a JSON
object; the user comment is stored as the value for a
`comment` key in the ATTRIBUTE column of this
table, as shown later in this discussion. The
`COMMENT` text can be any arbitrary quoted
text, and replaces any existing user comment. The
`ATTRIBUTE` value must be the valid string
representation of a JSON object. This is merged with any
existing user attribute as if the
[`JSON_MERGE_PATCH()`](json-modification-functions.md#function_json-merge-patch) function had
been used on the existing user attribute and the new one; for
any keys that are re-used, the new value overwrites the old
one, as shown here:

```sql
mysql> SELECT * FROM INFORMATION_SCHEMA.USER_ATTRIBUTES
    ->     WHERE USER='bill' AND HOST='localhost';
+------+-----------+----------------+
| USER | HOST      | ATTRIBUTE      |
+------+-----------+----------------+
| bill | localhost | {"foo": "bar"} |
+------+-----------+----------------+
1 row in set (0.11 sec)

mysql> ALTER USER 'bill'@'localhost' ATTRIBUTE '{"baz": "faz", "foo": "moo"}';
Query OK, 0 rows affected (0.22 sec)

mysql> SELECT * FROM INFORMATION_SCHEMA.USER_ATTRIBUTES
    ->     WHERE USER='bill' AND HOST='localhost';
+------+-----------+------------------------------+
| USER | HOST      | ATTRIBUTE                    |
+------+-----------+------------------------------+
| bill | localhost | {"baz": "faz", "foo": "moo"} |
+------+-----------+------------------------------+
1 row in set (0.00 sec)
```

To remove a key and its value from the user attribute, set the
key to JSON `null` (must be lowercase and
unquoted), like this:

```sql
mysql> ALTER USER 'bill'@'localhost' ATTRIBUTE '{"foo": null}';
Query OK, 0 rows affected (0.08 sec)

mysql> SELECT * FROM INFORMATION_SCHEMA.USER_ATTRIBUTES
    ->     WHERE USER='bill' AND HOST='localhost';
+------+-----------+----------------+
| USER | HOST      | ATTRIBUTE      |
+------+-----------+----------------+
| bill | localhost | {"baz": "faz"} |
+------+-----------+----------------+
1 row in set (0.00 sec)
```

To set an existing user comment to an empty string, use
`ALTER USER ... COMMENT ''`. This leaves an
empty `comment` value in the
[`USER_ATTRIBUTES`](information-schema-user-attributes-table.md "28.3.46 The INFORMATION_SCHEMA USER_ATTRIBUTES Table") table; to remove
the user comment completely, use `ALTER USER ...
ATTRIBUTE ...` with the value for the column key set
to JSON `null` (unquoted, in lower case).
This is illustrated by the following sequence of SQL
statements:

```sql
mysql> ALTER USER 'bill'@'localhost' COMMENT 'Something about Bill';
Query OK, 0 rows affected (0.06 sec)

mysql> SELECT * FROM INFORMATION_SCHEMA.USER_ATTRIBUTES
    ->     WHERE USER='bill' AND HOST='localhost';
+------+-----------+---------------------------------------------------+
| USER | HOST      | ATTRIBUTE                                         |
+------+-----------+---------------------------------------------------+
| bill | localhost | {"baz": "faz", "comment": "Something about Bill"} |
+------+-----------+---------------------------------------------------+
1 row in set (0.00 sec)

mysql> ALTER USER 'bill'@'localhost' COMMENT '';
Query OK, 0 rows affected (0.09 sec)

mysql> SELECT * FROM INFORMATION_SCHEMA.USER_ATTRIBUTES
    ->     WHERE USER='bill' AND HOST='localhost';
+------+-----------+-------------------------------+
| USER | HOST      | ATTRIBUTE                     |
+------+-----------+-------------------------------+
| bill | localhost | {"baz": "faz", "comment": ""} |
+------+-----------+-------------------------------+
1 row in set (0.00 sec)

mysql> ALTER USER 'bill'@'localhost' ATTRIBUTE '{"comment": null}';
Query OK, 0 rows affected (0.07 sec)

mysql> SELECT * FROM INFORMATION_SCHEMA.USER_ATTRIBUTES
    ->     WHERE USER='bill' AND HOST='localhost';
+------+-----------+----------------+
| USER | HOST      | ATTRIBUTE      |
+------+-----------+----------------+
| bill | localhost | {"baz": "faz"} |
+------+-----------+----------------+
1 row in set (0.00 sec)
```

##### ALTER USER Account-Locking Options

MySQL supports account locking and unlocking using the
`ACCOUNT LOCK` and `ACCOUNT
UNLOCK` options, which specify the locking state for
an account. For additional discussion, see
[Section 8.2.20, “Account Locking”](account-locking.md "8.2.20 Account Locking").

If multiple account-locking options are specified, the last
one takes precedence.

[`ALTER USER ...
ACCOUNT UNLOCK`](alter-user.md "15.7.1.1 ALTER USER Statement") unlocks any account named by the
statement that is temporarily locked due to too many failed
logins. See [Section 8.2.15, “Password Management”](password-management.md "8.2.15 Password Management").

##### ALTER USER Binary Logging

[`ALTER USER`](alter-user.md "15.7.1.1 ALTER USER Statement") is written to the
binary log if it succeeds, but not if it fails; in that case,
rollback occurs and no changes are made. A statement written
to the binary log includes all named users. If the `IF
EXISTS` clause is given, this includes even users
that do not exist and were not altered.

If the original statement changes the credentials for a user,
the statement written to the binary log specifies the
applicable authentication plugin for that user, determined as
follows:

- The plugin named in the original statement, if one was
  specified.
- Otherwise, the plugin associated with the user account if
  the user exists, or the default authentication plugin if
  the user does not exist. (If the statement written to the
  binary log must specify a particular authentication plugin
  for a user, include it in the original statement.)

If the server adds the default authentication plugin for any
users in the statement written to the binary log, it writes a
warning to the error log naming those users.

If the original statement specifies the
`FAILED_LOGIN_ATTEMPTS` or
`PASSWORD_LOCK_TIME` option, the statement
written to the binary log includes the option.

[`ALTER USER`](alter-user.md "15.7.1.1 ALTER USER Statement") statements with
clauses that support multifactor authentication (MFA) are
written to the binary log with the exception of `ALTER
USER user factor INITIATE
REGISTRATION` statements.

- `ALTER USER user factor
  FINISH REGISTRATION SET CHALLENGE_RESPONSE AS
  'auth_string'`
  statements are written to the binary log as `ALTER
  USER user MODIFY
  factor IDENTIFIED WITH
  authentication_fido AS
  fido_hash_string`;
- In a replication context, the replication user requires
  [`PASSWORDLESS_USER_ADMIN`](privileges-provided.md#priv_passwordless-user-admin)
  privilege to execute `ALTER USER ...
  MODIFY` operations on accounts configured for
  passwordless authentication using the
  `authentication_fido` plugin.
