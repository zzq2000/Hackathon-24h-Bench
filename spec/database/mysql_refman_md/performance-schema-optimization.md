### 10.2.4 Optimizing Performance Schema Queries

Applications that monitor databases may make frequent use of
Performance Schema tables. To write queries for these tables
most efficiently, take advantage of their indexes. For example,
include a `WHERE` clause that restricts
retrieved rows based on comparison to specific values in an
indexed column.

Most Performance Schema tables have indexes. Tables that do not
are those that normally contain few rows or are unlikely to be
queried frequently. Performance Schema indexes give the
optimizer access to execution plans other than full table scans.
These indexes also improve performance for related objects, such
as [`sys`](sys-schema.md "Chapter 30 MySQL sys Schema") schema views that use those
tables.

To see whether a given Performance Schema table has indexes and
what they are, use [`SHOW INDEX`](show-index.md "15.7.7.22 SHOW INDEX Statement") or
[`SHOW CREATE TABLE`](show-create-table.md "15.7.7.10 SHOW CREATE TABLE Statement"):

```sql
mysql> SHOW INDEX FROM performance_schema.accounts\G
*************************** 1. row ***************************
        Table: accounts
   Non_unique: 0
     Key_name: ACCOUNT
 Seq_in_index: 1
  Column_name: USER
    Collation: NULL
  Cardinality: NULL
     Sub_part: NULL
       Packed: NULL
         Null: YES
   Index_type: HASH
      Comment:
Index_comment:
      Visible: YES
*************************** 2. row ***************************
        Table: accounts
   Non_unique: 0
     Key_name: ACCOUNT
 Seq_in_index: 2
  Column_name: HOST
    Collation: NULL
  Cardinality: NULL
     Sub_part: NULL
       Packed: NULL
         Null: YES
   Index_type: HASH
      Comment:
Index_comment:
      Visible: YES

mysql> SHOW CREATE TABLE performance_schema.rwlock_instances\G
*************************** 1. row ***************************
       Table: rwlock_instances
Create Table: CREATE TABLE `rwlock_instances` (
  `NAME` varchar(128) NOT NULL,
  `OBJECT_INSTANCE_BEGIN` bigint(20) unsigned NOT NULL,
  `WRITE_LOCKED_BY_THREAD_ID` bigint(20) unsigned DEFAULT NULL,
  `READ_LOCKED_BY_COUNT` int(10) unsigned NOT NULL,
  PRIMARY KEY (`OBJECT_INSTANCE_BEGIN`),
  KEY `NAME` (`NAME`),
  KEY `WRITE_LOCKED_BY_THREAD_ID` (`WRITE_LOCKED_BY_THREAD_ID`)
) ENGINE=PERFORMANCE_SCHEMA DEFAULT CHARSET=utf8mb4 COLLATE=utf8mb4_0900_ai_ci
```

To see the execution plan for a Performance Schema query and
whether it uses any indexes, use
[`EXPLAIN`](explain.md "15.8.2 EXPLAIN Statement"):

```sql
mysql> EXPLAIN SELECT * FROM performance_schema.accounts
       WHERE (USER,HOST) = ('root','localhost')\G
*************************** 1. row ***************************
           id: 1
  select_type: SIMPLE
        table: accounts
   partitions: NULL
         type: const
possible_keys: ACCOUNT
          key: ACCOUNT
      key_len: 278
          ref: const,const
         rows: 1
     filtered: 100.00
        Extra: NULL
```

The [`EXPLAIN`](explain.md "15.8.2 EXPLAIN Statement") output indicates that
the optimizer uses the [`accounts`](performance-schema-accounts-table.md "29.12.8.1 The accounts Table")
table `ACCOUNT` index that comprises the
`USER` and `HOST` columns.

Performance Schema indexes are virtual: They are a construct of
the Performance Schema storage engine and use no memory or disk
storage. The Performance Schema reports index information to the
optimizer so that it can construct efficient execution plans.
The Performance Schema in turn uses optimizer information about
what to look for (for example, a particular key value), so that
it can perform efficient lookups without building actual index
structures. This implementation provides two important benefits:

- It entirely avoids the maintenance cost normally incurred
  for tables that undergo frequent updates.
- It reduces at an early stage of query execution the amount
  of data retrieved. For conditions on the indexed columns,
  the Performance Schema efficiently returns only table rows
  that satisfy the query conditions. Without an index, the
  Performance Schema would return all rows in the table,
  requiring that the optimizer later evaluate the conditions
  against each row to produce the final result.

Performance Schema indexes are predefined and cannot be dropped,
added, or altered.

Performance Schema indexes are similar to hash indexes. For
example:

- They are used only for equality comparisons that use the
  `=` or `<=>`
  operators.
- They are unordered. If a query result must have specific row
  ordering characteristics, include an `ORDER
  BY` clause.

For additional information about hash indexes, see
[Section 10.3.9, “Comparison of B-Tree and Hash Indexes”](index-btree-hash.md "10.3.9 Comparison of B-Tree and Hash Indexes").
