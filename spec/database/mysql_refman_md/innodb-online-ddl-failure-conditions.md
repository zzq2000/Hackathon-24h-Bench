### 17.12.7 Online DDL Failure Conditions

The failure of an online DDL operation is typically due to one of
the following conditions:

- An `ALGORITHM` clause specifies an algorithm
  that is not compatible with the particular type of DDL
  operation or storage engine.
- A `LOCK` clause specifies a low degree of
  locking (`SHARED` or `NONE`)
  that is not compatible with the particular type of DDL
  operation.
- A timeout occurs while waiting for an
  [exclusive lock](glossary.md#glos_exclusive_lock "exclusive lock") on
  the table, which may be needed briefly during the initial and
  final phases of the DDL operation.
- The [`tmpdir`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_tmpdir) or
  [`innodb_tmpdir`](innodb-parameters.md#sysvar_innodb_tmpdir) file system
  runs out of disk space, while MySQL writes temporary sort
  files on disk during index creation. For more information, see
  [Section 17.12.3, “Online DDL Space Requirements”](innodb-online-ddl-space-requirements.md "17.12.3 Online DDL Space Requirements").
- The operation takes a long time and concurrent DML modifies
  the table so much that the size of the temporary online log
  exceeds the value of the
  [`innodb_online_alter_log_max_size`](innodb-parameters.md#sysvar_innodb_online_alter_log_max_size)
  configuration option. This condition causes a
  `DB_ONLINE_LOG_TOO_BIG` error.
- Concurrent DML makes changes to the table that are allowed
  with the original table definition, but not with the new one.
  The operation only fails at the very end, when MySQL tries to
  apply all the changes from concurrent DML statements. For
  example, you might insert duplicate values into a column while
  a unique index is being created, or you might insert
  `NULL` values into a column while creating a
  [primary key](glossary.md#glos_primary_key "primary key") index on
  that column. The changes made by the concurrent DML take
  precedence, and the [`ALTER TABLE`](alter-table.md "15.1.9 ALTER TABLE Statement")
  operation is effectively [rolled
  back](glossary.md#glos_rollback "rollback").
