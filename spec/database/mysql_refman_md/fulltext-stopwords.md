### 14.9.4 Full-Text Stopwords

The stopword list is loaded and searched for full-text queries
using the server character set and collation (the values of the
[`character_set_server`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_character_set_server) and
[`collation_server`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_collation_server) system
variables). False hits or misses might occur for stopword
lookups if the stopword file or columns used for full-text
indexing or searches have a character set or collation different
from [`character_set_server`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_character_set_server) or
[`collation_server`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_collation_server).

Case sensitivity of stopword lookups depends on the server
collation. For example, lookups are case-insensitive if the
collation is `utf8mb4_0900_ai_ci`, whereas
lookups are case-sensitive if the collation is
`utf8mb4_0900_as_cs` or
`utf8mb4_bin`.

#### Stopwords for InnoDB Search Indexes

`InnoDB` has a relatively short list of
default stopwords, because documents from technical, literary,
and other sources often use short words as keywords or in
significant phrases. For example, you might search for
“to be or not to be” and expect to get a sensible
result, rather than having all those words ignored.

To see the default `InnoDB` stopword list,
query the Information Schema
[`INNODB_FT_DEFAULT_STOPWORD`](information-schema-innodb-ft-default-stopword-table.md "28.4.16 The INFORMATION_SCHEMA INNODB_FT_DEFAULT_STOPWORD Table") table.

```sql
mysql> SELECT * FROM INFORMATION_SCHEMA.INNODB_FT_DEFAULT_STOPWORD;
+-------+
| value |
+-------+
| a     |
| about |
| an    |
| are   |

| www   |
+-------+
36 rows in set (0.00 sec)
```

To define your own stopword list for all
`InnoDB` tables, define a table with the same
structure as the
[`INNODB_FT_DEFAULT_STOPWORD`](information-schema-innodb-ft-default-stopword-table.md "28.4.16 The INFORMATION_SCHEMA INNODB_FT_DEFAULT_STOPWORD Table") table,
populate it with stopwords, and set the value of the
[`innodb_ft_server_stopword_table`](innodb-parameters.md#sysvar_innodb_ft_server_stopword_table)
option to a value in the form
`db_name/table_name`
before creating the full-text index. The stopword table must
have a single [`VARCHAR`](char.md "13.3.2 The CHAR and VARCHAR Types") column
named `value`. The following example
demonstrates creating and configuring a new global stopword
table for `InnoDB`.

```sql
-- Create a new stopword table

mysql> CREATE TABLE my_stopwords(value VARCHAR(30)) ENGINE = INNODB;
Query OK, 0 rows affected (0.01 sec)

-- Insert stopwords (for simplicity, a single stopword is used in this example)

mysql> INSERT INTO my_stopwords(value) VALUES ('Ishmael');
Query OK, 1 row affected (0.00 sec)

-- Create the table

mysql> CREATE TABLE opening_lines (
id INT UNSIGNED AUTO_INCREMENT NOT NULL PRIMARY KEY,
opening_line TEXT(500),
author VARCHAR(200),
title VARCHAR(200)
) ENGINE=InnoDB;
Query OK, 0 rows affected (0.01 sec)

-- Insert data into the table

mysql> INSERT INTO opening_lines(opening_line,author,title) VALUES
('Call me Ishmael.','Herman Melville','Moby-Dick'),
('A screaming comes across the sky.','Thomas Pynchon','Gravity\'s Rainbow'),
('I am an invisible man.','Ralph Ellison','Invisible Man'),
('Where now? Who now? When now?','Samuel Beckett','The Unnamable'),
('It was love at first sight.','Joseph Heller','Catch-22'),
('All this happened, more or less.','Kurt Vonnegut','Slaughterhouse-Five'),
('Mrs. Dalloway said she would buy the flowers herself.','Virginia Woolf','Mrs. Dalloway'),
('It was a pleasure to burn.','Ray Bradbury','Fahrenheit 451');
Query OK, 8 rows affected (0.00 sec)
Records: 8  Duplicates: 0  Warnings: 0

-- Set the innodb_ft_server_stopword_table option to the new stopword table

mysql> SET GLOBAL innodb_ft_server_stopword_table = 'test/my_stopwords';
Query OK, 0 rows affected (0.00 sec)

-- Create the full-text index (which rebuilds the table if no FTS_DOC_ID column is defined)

mysql> CREATE FULLTEXT INDEX idx ON opening_lines(opening_line);
Query OK, 0 rows affected, 1 warning (1.17 sec)
Records: 0  Duplicates: 0  Warnings: 1
```

Verify that the specified stopword ('Ishmael') does not appear
by querying the Information Schema
[`INNODB_FT_INDEX_TABLE`](information-schema-innodb-ft-index-table-table.md "28.4.19 The INFORMATION_SCHEMA INNODB_FT_INDEX_TABLE Table") table.

Note

By default, words less than 3 characters in length or
greater than 84 characters in length do not appear in an
`InnoDB` full-text search index. Maximum
and minimum word length values are configurable using the
[`innodb_ft_max_token_size`](innodb-parameters.md#sysvar_innodb_ft_max_token_size)
and
[`innodb_ft_min_token_size`](innodb-parameters.md#sysvar_innodb_ft_min_token_size)
variables. This default behavior does not apply to the ngram
parser plugin. ngram token size is defined by the
[`ngram_token_size`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_ngram_token_size) option.

```sql
mysql> SET GLOBAL innodb_ft_aux_table='test/opening_lines';
Query OK, 0 rows affected (0.00 sec)

mysql> SELECT word FROM INFORMATION_SCHEMA.INNODB_FT_INDEX_TABLE LIMIT 15;
+-----------+
| word      |
+-----------+
| across    |
| all       |
| burn      |
| buy       |
| call      |
| comes     |
| dalloway  |
| first     |
| flowers   |
| happened  |
| herself   |
| invisible |
| less      |
| love      |
| man       |
+-----------+
15 rows in set (0.00 sec)
```

To create stopword lists on a table-by-table basis, create
other stopword tables and use the
[`innodb_ft_user_stopword_table`](innodb-parameters.md#sysvar_innodb_ft_user_stopword_table)
option to specify the stopword table that you want to use
before you create the full-text index.

#### Stopwords for MyISAM Search Indexes

The stopword file is loaded and searched using
`latin1` if
`character_set_server` is
`ucs2`, `utf16`,
`utf16le`, or `utf32`.

To override the default stopword list for MyISAM tables, set
the [`ft_stopword_file`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_ft_stopword_file) system
variable. (See [Section 7.1.8, “Server System Variables”](server-system-variables.md "7.1.8 Server System Variables").) The
variable value should be the path name of the file containing
the stopword list, or the empty string to disable stopword
filtering. The server looks for the file in the data directory
unless an absolute path name is given to specify a different
directory. After changing the value of this variable or the
contents of the stopword file, restart the server and rebuild
your `FULLTEXT` indexes.

The stopword list is free-form, separating stopwords with any
nonalphanumeric character such as newline, space, or comma.
Exceptions are the underscore character (`_`)
and a single apostrophe (`'`) which are
treated as part of a word. The character set of the stopword
list is the server's default character set; see
[Section 12.3.2, “Server Character Set and Collation”](charset-server.md "12.3.2 Server Character Set and Collation").

The following list shows the default stopwords for
`MyISAM` search indexes. In a MySQL source
distribution, you can find this list in the
`storage/myisam/ft_static.c` file.
