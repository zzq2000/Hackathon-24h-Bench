### 28.6.2 The INFORMATION\_SCHEMA CONNECTION\_CONTROL\_FAILED\_LOGIN\_ATTEMPTS Table

This table provides information about the current number of
consecutive failed connection attempts per account (user/host
combination).

[`CONNECTION_CONTROL_FAILED_LOGIN_ATTEMPTS`](information-schema-connection-control-failed-login-attempts-table.md "28.6.2 The INFORMATION_SCHEMA CONNECTION_CONTROL_FAILED_LOGIN_ATTEMPTS Table")
has these columns:

- `USERHOST`

  The user/host combination indicating an account that has
  failed connection attempts, in
  `'user_name'@'host_name'`
  format.
- `FAILED_ATTEMPTS`

  The current number of consecutive failed connection attempts
  for the `USERHOST` value. This counts all
  failed attempts, regardless of whether they were delayed. The
  number of attempts for which the server added a delay to its
  response is the difference between the
  `FAILED_ATTEMPTS` value and the
  [`connection_control_failed_connections_threshold`](connection-control-plugin-variables.md#sysvar_connection_control_failed_connections_threshold)
  system variable value.

#### Notes

- The
  `CONNECTION_CONTROL_FAILED_LOGIN_ATTEMPTS`
  plugin must be activated for this table to be available, and
  the `CONNECTION_CONTROL` plugin must be
  activated or the table contents are always empty. See
  [Section 8.4.2, “Connection Control Plugins”](connection-control-plugin.md "8.4.2 Connection Control Plugins").
- The table contains rows only for accounts that have had one or
  more consecutive failed connection attempts without a
  subsequent successful attempt. When an account connects
  successfully, its failed-connection count is reset to zero and
  the server removes any row corresponding to the account.
- Assigning a value to the
  [`connection_control_failed_connections_threshold`](connection-control-plugin-variables.md#sysvar_connection_control_failed_connections_threshold)
  system variable at runtime resets all accumulated
  failed-connection counters to zero, which causes the table to
  become empty.
