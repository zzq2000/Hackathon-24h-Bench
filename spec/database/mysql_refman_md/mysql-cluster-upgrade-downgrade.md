### 25.3.7 Upgrading and Downgrading NDB Cluster

- [Versions Supported for Upgrade to NDB 8.0](mysql-cluster-upgrade-downgrade.md#mysql-cluster-upgrade-versions "Versions Supported for Upgrade to NDB 8.0")
- [Reverting an NDB Cluster 8.0 Upgrade](mysql-cluster-upgrade-downgrade.md#mysql-cluster-revert-upgrade "Reverting an NDB Cluster 8.0 Upgrade")
- [Known Issues When Upgrading or Downgrading NDB Cluster](mysql-cluster-upgrade-downgrade.md#mysql-cluster-updowngrade-issues "Known Issues When Upgrading or Downgrading NDB Cluster")

This section provides information about NDB Cluster software and
compatibility between different NDB Cluster 8.0 releases with
regard to performing upgrades and downgrades. You should already
be familiar with installing and configuring NDB Cluster prior to
attempting an upgrade or downgrade. See
[Section 25.4, “Configuration of NDB Cluster”](mysql-cluster-configuration.md "25.4 Configuration of NDB Cluster").

Important

Online upgrades and downgrades between minor releases of the
`NDB` storage engine are supported within NDB
8.0. In-place upgrades of the included MySQL Server (SQL node
[**mysqld**](mysqld.md "6.3.1 mysqld — The MySQL Server")) are also supported; with multiple SQL
nodes, it is possible to keep an SQL application online while
individual [**mysqld**](mysqld.md "6.3.1 mysqld — The MySQL Server") processes are restarted.
In-place downgrades of the included MySQL Server are
*not* supported (see
[Chapter 4, *Downgrading MySQL*](downgrading.md "Chapter 4 Downgrading MySQL")).

It may be possible in some cases to revert a recent upgrade from
one NDB 8.0 minor release version to a later one, and to restore
the needed states of any MySQL Server instances running as SQL
nodes. Against the event that this becomes desirable or
necessary, you are strongly advised to take a complete backup of
each SQL node prior to upgrading NDB Cluster. For the same
reason, you should also start the [**mysqld**](mysqld.md "6.3.1 mysqld — The MySQL Server")
binaries from the new version with
[`--ndb-schema-dist-upgrade-allowed=0`](mysql-cluster-options-variables.md#sysvar_ndb_schema_dist_upgrade_allowed),
and not allow it to be set back to 1 until you are sure any
likelihood of reverting to an older version is past. For more
information, see [Reverting an NDB Cluster 8.0 Upgrade](mysql-cluster-upgrade-downgrade.md#mysql-cluster-revert-upgrade "Reverting an NDB Cluster 8.0 Upgrade").

For information about upgrades to NDB 8.0 from versions previous
to 8.0, see [Versions Supported for Upgrade to NDB 8.0](mysql-cluster-upgrade-downgrade.md#mysql-cluster-upgrade-versions "Versions Supported for Upgrade to NDB 8.0").

For information about known issues and problems encountered when
upgrading or downgrading NDB 8.0, see
[Known Issues When Upgrading or Downgrading NDB Cluster](mysql-cluster-upgrade-downgrade.md#mysql-cluster-updowngrade-issues "Known Issues When Upgrading or Downgrading NDB Cluster").

#### Versions Supported for Upgrade to NDB 8.0

The following versions of NDB Cluster are supported for upgrades
to GA releases of NDB Cluster 8.0 (8.0.19 and later):

- NDB Cluster 7.6: NDB 7.6.4 and later
- NDB Cluster 7.5: NDB 7.5.4 and later
- NDB Cluster 7.4: NDB 7.4.6 and later

To upgrade from a release series previous to NDB 7.4, you must
upgrade in stages, first to one of the versions just listed, and
then from that version to the latest NDB 8.0 release. In such
cases, upgrading to the latest NDB 7.6 release is recommended as
the first step. For information about upgrades to NDB 7.6 from
previous versions, see
[Upgrading and Downgrading NDB 7.6](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/mysql-cluster-upgrade-downgrade-7-6.html).

#### Reverting an NDB Cluster 8.0 Upgrade

Following a recent software upgrade of an NDB Cluster to an NDB
8.0 release, it is possible to revert the `NDB`
software back to the earlier version, provided certain
conditions are met before the upgrade, during the time the
cluster is running the newer version, and after the NDB Cluster
software is reverted to the earlier version. Specifics depend on
local conditions; this section provides general information
about what should be done at each of the points in the upgrade
and rollback process just described.

In most cases, upgrading and downgrading the data nodes can be
done without issue, as described elsewhere; see
[Section 25.6.5, “Performing a Rolling Restart of an NDB Cluster”](mysql-cluster-rolling-restart.md "25.6.5 Performing a Rolling Restart of an NDB Cluster"). (Prior to
performing an upgrade or downgrade, you should perform an
`NDB` backup; see
[Section 25.6.8, “Online Backup of NDB Cluster”](mysql-cluster-backup.md "25.6.8 Online Backup of NDB Cluster"), for information about
how to do this.) Downgrading SQL nodes online is not supported,
due to the following issues:

- [**mysqld**](mysqld.md "6.3.1 mysqld — The MySQL Server") from a version 8.0 release cannot
  start if it detects a file system from a later version of
  MySQL.
- In many cases, [**mysqld**](mysqld.md "6.3.1 mysqld — The MySQL Server") cannot open tables
  that were created or modified by a later version of MySQL.
- In most if not all cases, [**mysqld**](mysqld.md "6.3.1 mysqld — The MySQL Server") cannot
  read binary log files that were created or modified in a
  later version of MySQL.

The procedure outlined next provides the basic steps necessary
to upgrade a cluster from version *`X`*
to version *`Y`* while allowing for a
possible future rollback to *`X`*. (The
procedure for reverting the upgraded cluster to version
*`X`* follows later in this section.) For
this purpose, version *`X`* is any NDB
8.0 GA release, or any previous NDB release supported for
upgrade to NDB 8.0 (see
[Versions Supported for Upgrade to NDB 8.0](mysql-cluster-upgrade-downgrade.md#mysql-cluster-upgrade-versions "Versions Supported for Upgrade to NDB 8.0")), and version
*`Y`* is an NDB 8.0 release which is
later than *`X`*.

- *Prior to upgrade*: Take backups of NDB
  *`X`* SQL node states. This can be
  accomplished as one or more of the following:

  - A copy of the version *`X`* SQL
    node file system in a quiescent state using one or more
    system tools such as
    **cp**,
    **rsync**,
    **fwbackups**, Amanda, and
    so forth.

    A dump of any version *`X`*
    tables not stored in `NDB`. You can
    generate this dump using [**mysqldump**](mysqldump.md "6.5.4 mysqldump — A Database Backup Program").

    A backup created using MySQL Enterprise Backup; see
    [Section 32.1, “MySQL Enterprise Backup Overview”](mysql-enterprise-backup.md "32.1 MySQL Enterprise Backup Overview"), for more
    information.

  Backing up the SQL nodes is recommended prior to any
  upgrade, whether or not you later intend to revert the
  cluster to the previous `NDB` version.
- *Upgrade to NDB
  *`Y`**: All NDB
  *`Y`* [**mysqld**](mysqld.md "6.3.1 mysqld — The MySQL Server")
  binaries must be started with
  [`--ndb-schema-dist-upgrade-allowed=0`](mysql-cluster-options-variables.md#sysvar_ndb_schema_dist_upgrade_allowed)
  to prevent any automatic schema upgrade. (Once any
  possibility of a downgrade is past, you can safely change
  the corresponding system variable
  `ndb_schema_dist_upgrade_allowed` back to
  1, the default, in the [**mysql**](mysql.md "6.5.1 mysql — The MySQL Command-Line Client") client.)
  When each NDB *`Y`* SQL node starts,
  it connects to the cluster and synchronizes its
  `NDB` table schemas. After this, you can
  restore MySQL table and state data from backup.

  To assure continuity of NDB replication, it is necessary to
  upgrade the cluster's SQL nodes in such a way that at
  least one [**mysqld**](mysqld.md "6.3.1 mysqld — The MySQL Server") is acting as the
  replication source at any given point in time during the
  upgrade. With two SQL nodes *`A`* and
  *`B`*, you can do so like this:

  1. While using SQL node *`B`* as the
     replication channel, upgrade SQL node
     *`A`* from NDB version
     *`X`* to version
     *`Y`*. This results in a gap in
     the binary log on *`A`* at epoch
     *`E1`*.
  2. After all replication appliers have consumed the binary
     log from SQL node *`B`* past
     epoch *`E1`*, switch the
     replication channel to use SQL node
     *`A`*.
  3. Upgrade SQL node *`B`* to NDB
     version *`Y`*. This results in a
     gap in the binary log on *`B`* at
     epoch *`E2`*.
  4. After all replication appliers have consumed the binary
     log from SQL node *`A`* past
     epoch *`E2`*, you can once again
     switch the replication channel to use either SQL node as
     desired.

  Do not use [`ALTER TABLE`](alter-table.md "15.1.9 ALTER TABLE Statement") on any
  existing `NDB` tables; do not create any
  new `NDB` tables which cannot be safely
  dropped prior to downgrading.

The following procedure shows the basic steps needed to roll
back (revert) an NDB Cluster from version
*`X`* to version
*`Y`* after an upgrade performed as just
described. Here, version *`X`* is any NDB
8.0 GA release, or any previous NDB release supported for
upgrade to NDB 8.0 (see
[Versions Supported for Upgrade to NDB 8.0](mysql-cluster-upgrade-downgrade.md#mysql-cluster-upgrade-versions "Versions Supported for Upgrade to NDB 8.0")); version
*`Y`* is an NDB 8.0 release which is
later than *`X`*.

- *Prior to rollback*: Gather any
  [**mysqld**](mysqld.md "6.3.1 mysqld — The MySQL Server") state information from the NDB
  *`Y`* SQL nodes that should be
  retained. In most cases, you can do this using
  [**mysqldump**](mysqldump.md "6.5.4 mysqldump — A Database Backup Program").

  After backing up the state data, drop all
  `NDB` tables which have been created or
  altered since the upgrade took place.

  Backing up the SQL nodes is always recommended prior to any
  NDB Cluster software version change.

  You must provide a file system compatible with MySQL
  *`X`* for each
  [**mysqld**](mysqld.md "6.3.1 mysqld — The MySQL Server") (SQL node). You can use either of
  the following two methods:

  - Create a new, compatible file system state by
    reinitializing the on-disk state of the version
    *`X`* SQL node. You can do this
    by removing the SQL node file system, then running
    [**mysqld**](mysqld.md "6.3.1 mysqld — The MySQL Server")
    [`--initialize`](server-options.md#option_mysqld_initialize).
  - Restore a file system that is compatible from a backup
    taken prior to the upgrade (see
    [Section 9.4, “Using mysqldump for Backups”](using-mysqldump.md "9.4 Using mysqldump for Backups")).
- *Following `NDB`
  downgrade*: After downgrading the data nodes to
  NDB *`X`*, start the version
  *`X`* SQL nodes (instances of
  [**mysqld**](mysqld.md "6.3.1 mysqld — The MySQL Server")). Restore or repair any other
  local state information needed on each SQL node. The MySQLD
  state can be aligned as necessary with some combination (0
  or more) of the following actions:

  - Initialization commands such as
    [**mysqld**](mysqld.md "6.3.1 mysqld — The MySQL Server") `--initialize`.
  - Restore any desired or required state information
    captured from the version *`X`*
    SQL node.
  - Restore any desired or required state information
    captured from the version *`Y`*
    SQL node.
  - Perform cleanup such as deleting stale logs such as
    binary logs, or relay logs, and removing any
    time-dependent state which is no longer valid.

  As when upgrading, it is necessary when downgrading to
  maintain continuity of NDB replication to downgrade the
  cluster's SQL nodes in such a way that at least one
  [**mysqld**](mysqld.md "6.3.1 mysqld — The MySQL Server") is acting as the replication
  source at any given point in time during the downgrade
  process. This can be done in a manner very similar to that
  described previously for upgrading the SQL nodes. With two
  SQL nodes *`A`* and
  *`B`*, you can maintain binary
  logging without any gaps during the downgrade like this:

  1. With SQL node *`B`* acting as the
     replication channel, downgrade SQL node
     *`A`* from NDB version
     *`Y`* to version
     *`X`*. This results in a gap in
     the binary log on *`A`* at epoch
     *`F1`*.
  2. After all replication appliers have consumed the binary
     log from SQL node *`B`* past
     epoch *`F1`*, switch the
     replication channel to use SQL node
     *`A`*.
  3. Downgrade SQL node *`B`* to NDB
     version *`X`*. This results in a
     gap in the binary log on *`B`* at
     epoch *`F2`*.
  4. After all replication appliers have consumed the binary
     log from SQL node *`A`* past
     epoch *`F2`*, redundancy of
     binary logging is restored, and you can again use either
     SQL node as the replication channel as desired.

#### Known Issues When Upgrading or Downgrading NDB Cluster

In this section, provide information about issues known to occur
when upgrading or downgrading to, from, or between NDB 8.0
releases.

We recommend that you not attempt any schema changes during any
NDB Cluster software upgrade or downgrade. Some of the reasons
for this are listed here:

- DDL statements on `NDB` tables are not
  possible during some phases of data node startup.
- DDL statements on `NDB` tables may be
  rejected if any data nodes are stopped during execution;
  stopping each data node binary (so it can be replaced with a
  binary from the target version) is required as part of the
  upgrade or downgrade process.
- DDL statements on `NDB` tables are not
  allowed while there are data nodes in the same cluster
  running different release versions of the NDB Cluster
  software.

For additional information regarding the rolling restart
procedure used to perform an online upgrade or downgrade of the
data nodes, see [Section 25.6.5, “Performing a Rolling Restart of an NDB Cluster”](mysql-cluster-rolling-restart.md "25.6.5 Performing a Rolling Restart of an NDB Cluster").

You should be aware of the issues in the following list when you
perform an online upgrade between minor versions of NDB 8.0.
These issues also apply when upgrading from a previous major
version of NDB Cluster to any of the NDB 8.0 releases stated.

- NDB 8.0.22 adds support for IPv6 addressing for management
  nodes and data nodes in the `config.ini`
  file. To begin using IPv6 addresses as part of an upgrade,
  perform the following steps:

  1. Perform an upgrade of the cluster to version 8.0.22 or a
     later version of the NDB Cluster software in the usual
     manner.
  2. Change the addresses used in the
     `config.ini` file to IPv6 addresses.
  3. Perform a system restart of the cluster.

  A known issue on Linux platforms when running NDB 8.0.22 and
  later was that the operating system kernel was required to
  provide IPv6 support, even when no IPv6 addresses were in
  use. This issue is fixed in NDB 8.0.34 and later (Bug
  #33324817, Bug #33870642).

  If you are using an affected version and wish to disable
  support for IPv6 on the system (because you do not plan to
  use any IPv6 addresses for NDB Cluster nodes), do so after
  booting the system, like this:

  ```terminal
  $> sysctl -w net.ipv6.conf.all.disable_ipv6=1
  $> sysctl -w net.ipv6.conf.default.disable_ipv6=1
  ```

  (Alternatively, you can add the corresponding lines to
  `/etc/sysctl.conf`.) In NDB Cluster
  8.0.34 and later, the preceding is not necessary, and you
  can simply disable IPv6 support in the Linux kernel if you
  do not want or need it.
- Due to changes in the internal
  `mysql.ndb_schema` table, if you upgrade to
  an NDB 8.0 release prior to 8.0.24, then you are advised to
  use [`--ndb-schema-dist-upgrade-allowed
  = 0`](mysql-cluster-options-variables.md#sysvar_ndb_schema_dist_upgrade_allowed) to avoid unexpected outages (Bug #30876990, Bug
  #31016905).

  In addition, if there is any possibility that you may revert
  to a previous version of NDB Cluster following an upgrade to
  a newer version, you must start all
  [**mysqld**](mysqld.md "6.3.1 mysqld — The MySQL Server") processes from the newer version
  with `--ndb-schema-dist-upgrade-allowed = 0`
  to prevent changes incompatible with the older version from
  being made to the `ndb_schema` table. See
  [Reverting an NDB Cluster 8.0 Upgrade](mysql-cluster-upgrade-downgrade.md#mysql-cluster-revert-upgrade "Reverting an NDB Cluster 8.0 Upgrade"), for
  information about how to do this.
- The
  [`EncryptedFileSystem`](mysql-cluster-ndbd-definition.md#ndbparam-ndbd-encryptedfilesystem)
  configuration parameter, introduced in NDB 8.0.29, could in
  some cases cause undo log files to be encrypted, even when
  set explicitly to `0`, which could lead to
  issues when using Disk Data tables and attempting to upgrade
  or downgrade to NDB 8.0.29. In such cases, you can work
  around the problem by performing initial restarts of the
  data nodes as part of the rolling restart process.
- If you are using multithreaded data nodes
  ([**ndbmtd**](mysql-cluster-programs-ndbmtd.md "25.5.3 ndbmtd — The NDB Cluster Data Node Daemon (Multi-Threaded)")) and the
  [`ThreadConfig`](mysql-cluster-ndbd-definition.md#ndbparam-ndbmtd-threadconfig)
  configuration parameter, you may need to make changes in the
  value set for this in the `config.ini`
  file when upgrading from a previous release to NDB 8.0.30 or
  later. When upgrading from NDB 8.0.23 or earlier, any usage
  of `main`, `rep`,
  `recv`, or `ldm` threads
  that was implicit in the earlier version must be explicitly
  set. When upgrading from NDB 8.0.23 or later to NDB 8.0.30
  or later, any usage of `recv` threads must
  be set explicitly in the `ThreadConfig`
  string. In addition, to avoid using `main`,
  `rep`, or `ldm` threads in
  NDB 8.0.30 or later, you must set the thread count for the
  given type to `0` explicitly.

  An example follows.

  *NDB 8.0.22 and earlier*:

  - `config.ini` file contains
    `ThreadConfig=ldm`.
  - This is interpreted by these versions of
    `NDB` as
    `ThreadConfig=main,ldm,recv,rep`.
  - Required in `config.ini` to match
    effect in NDB 8.0.30 or later:
    `ThreadConfig=main,ldm,recv,rep`.

  *NDB 8.0.23—8.0.29*:

  - `config.ini` file contains
    `ThreadConfig=ldm`.
  - This is interpreted by these versions of
    `NDB` as
    `ThreadConfig=ldm,recv`.
  - Required in `config.ini` to match
    effect in NDB 8.0.30 or later:
    `ThreadConfig=main={count=0},ldm,recv,rep={count=0}`.

  For more information, see the description of the
  [`ThreadConfig`](mysql-cluster-ndbd-definition.md#ndbparam-ndbmtd-threadconfig)
  configuration parameter.

Upgrades from previous major versions of NDB Cluster (7.4, 7.5,
7.6) to NDB 8.0 are supported; see
[Versions Supported for Upgrade to NDB 8.0](mysql-cluster-upgrade-downgrade.md#mysql-cluster-upgrade-versions "Versions Supported for Upgrade to NDB 8.0"), for specific
versions. Such upgrades are subject to the issues listed here:

- In NDB 8.0, the default value for
  [`log_bin`](replication-options-binary-log.md#sysvar_log_bin) is 1, a change from
  earlier releases. In addition, as of NDB 8.0.16, the default
  value for [`ndb_log_bin`](mysql-cluster-options-variables.md#sysvar_ndb_log_bin)
  changed from 1 to 0, which means that
  `ndb_log_bin` must be set explicitly to 1
  to enable binary logging in this and later versions.
- Distributed privileges shared between MySQL servers as
  implemented in prior release series (see
  [Distributed Privileges Using Shared Grant Tables](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/mysql-cluster-privilege-distribution.html))
  are not supported in NDB Cluster 8.0. When started, the
  [**mysqld**](mysqld.md "6.3.1 mysqld — The MySQL Server") supplied with NDB 8.0 and later
  checks for the existence of any grant tables which use the
  `NDB` storage engine; if it finds any, it
  creates local copies (“shadow tables”) of these
  using `InnoDB`. This is true for each MySQL
  server connected to NDB Cluster. After this has been
  performed on all MySQL servers acting as NDB Cluster SQL
  nodes, the `NDB` grant tables may be safely
  removed using the [**ndb\_drop\_table**](mysql-cluster-programs-ndb-drop-table.md "25.5.11 ndb_drop_table — Drop an NDB Table") utility
  supplied with the NDB Cluster distribution, like this:

  ```terminal
  ndb_drop_table -d mysql user db columns_priv tables_priv proxies_priv procs_priv
  ```

  It is safe to retain the `NDB` grant
  tables, but they are not used for access control and are
  effectively ignored.

  For more information about the MySQL privileges system used
  in NDB 8.0, see
  [Section 25.6.13, “Privilege Synchronization and NDB\_STORED\_USER”](mysql-cluster-privilege-synchronization.md "25.6.13 Privilege Synchronization and NDB_STORED_USER"),
  as well as [Section 8.2.3, “Grant Tables”](grant-tables.md "8.2.3 Grant Tables").
- It is necessary to restart all data nodes with
  [`--initial`](mysql-cluster-programs-ndbd.md#option_ndbd_initial) when upgrading any
  release prior to NDB 7.6 to any NDB 8.0 release. This is due
  to the addition of support for increased numbers of nodes in
  NDB 8.0.

Issues encountered when trying to downgrade from NDB 8.0 to a
previous major version can be found in the following list:

- Tables created in NDB 8.0 are not backwards compatible with
  NDB 7.6 and earlier releases due to a change in usage of the
  extra metadata property implemented by
  `NDB` tables to provide full support for
  the MySQL data dictionary. This means that it is necessary
  to take extra steps to preserve any desired state
  information from the cluster's SQL nodes prior to the
  downgrade, and then to restore it afterwards.

  More specifically, online downgrades of the
  `NDBCLUSTER` storage engine—that is,
  of the data nodes—are supported, but SQL nodes cannot
  be downgraded online. This is because a MySQL Server
  ([**mysqld**](mysqld.md "6.3.1 mysqld — The MySQL Server")) of a given MySQL 8.0 or earlier
  version cannot use system files from a (later) 8.0 version,
  and cannot open tables that were created in the later
  version. It may be possible to roll back a cluster that has
  recently been upgraded from a previous NDB release; see
  [Reverting an NDB Cluster 8.0 Upgrade](mysql-cluster-upgrade-downgrade.md#mysql-cluster-revert-upgrade "Reverting an NDB Cluster 8.0 Upgrade"), for
  information regarding when and how this can be done.

  For additional information relating to these issues, see
  [Changes in NDB table extra metadata](mysql-cluster-what-is-new.md#mysql-cluster-what-is-new-8-0-extra-metadata "Changes in NDB table extra metadata");
  see also [Chapter 16, *MySQL Data Dictionary*](data-dictionary.md "Chapter 16 MySQL Data Dictionary").
- In NDB 8.0, the binary configuration file format has been
  enhanced to provide support for greater numbers of nodes
  than in previous versions. The new format is not accessible
  to nodes running older versions of `NDB`,
  although newer management servers can detect older nodes and
  communicate with them using the appropriate format.

  While upgrades to NDB 8.0 should not be problematic in this
  regard, older management servers cannot read the newer
  binary configuration file format, so that some manual
  intervention is required when downgrading from NDB 8.0 to a
  previous major version. When performing such a downgrade, it
  is necessary to remove any cached binary configuration files
  prior to starting the management using the older
  `NDB` software version, and to have the
  plaintext configuration file available for the management
  server to read. Alternatively, you can start the older
  management server using the
  [`--initial`](mysql-cluster-programs-ndb-mgmd.md#option_ndb_mgmd_initial) option (again, it
  is necessary to have the `config.ini`
  available). If the cluster uses multiple management servers,
  one of these two things must be done for each management
  server binary.

  Also in connection with support for increased numbers of
  nodes, and due to incompatible changes implemented in NDB
  8.0 in the data node LCP `Sysfile`, it is
  necessary, when performing an online downgrade from NDB 8.0
  to a prior major version, to restart all data nodes using
  the [`--initial`](mysql-cluster-programs-ndbd.md#option_ndbd_initial) option.
- Online downgrades of clusters running more than 48 data
  nodes, or with data nodes using node IDs greater than 48, to
  earlier NDB Cluster releases from NDB 8.0 are not supported.
  It is necessary in such cases to reduce the number of data
  nodes, to change the configurations for all data nodes such
  that they use node IDs less than or equal to 48, or both, as
  required not to exceed the old maximums.
- If you are downgrading from NDB 8.0 to NDB 7.5 or NDB 7.4,
  you must set an explicit value for
  [`IndexMemory`](mysql-cluster-ndbd-definition.md#ndbparam-ndbd-indexmemory) in the
  cluster configuration file if none is already present. This
  is because NDB 8.0 does not use this parameter (which was
  removed in NDB 7.6) and sets it to 0 by default, whereas it
  is required in NDB 7.5 and NDB 7.4, in both of which the
  cluster refuses to start with Invalid
  configuration received from Management Server...
  if `IndexMemory` is not set to a nonzero
  value.

  Setting `IndexMemory` is
  *not* required for downgrades from NDB
  8.0 to NDB 7.6.
