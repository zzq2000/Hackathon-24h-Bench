#### 10.10.2.4 Index Preloading

If there are enough blocks in a key cache to hold blocks of an
entire index, or at least the blocks corresponding to its
nonleaf nodes, it makes sense to preload the key cache with
index blocks before starting to use it. Preloading enables you
to put the table index blocks into a key cache buffer in the
most efficient way: by reading the index blocks from disk
sequentially.

Without preloading, the blocks are still placed into the key
cache as needed by queries. Although the blocks stay in the
cache, because there are enough buffers for all of them, they
are fetched from disk in random order, and not sequentially.

To preload an index into a cache, use the
[`LOAD INDEX INTO
CACHE`](load-index.md "15.7.8.5 LOAD INDEX INTO CACHE Statement") statement. For example, the following
statement preloads nodes (index blocks) of indexes of the
tables `t1` and `t2`:

```sql
mysql> LOAD INDEX INTO CACHE t1, t2 IGNORE LEAVES;
+---------+--------------+----------+----------+
| Table   | Op           | Msg_type | Msg_text |
+---------+--------------+----------+----------+
| test.t1 | preload_keys | status   | OK       |
| test.t2 | preload_keys | status   | OK       |
+---------+--------------+----------+----------+
```

The `IGNORE LEAVES` modifier causes only
blocks for the nonleaf nodes of the index to be preloaded.
Thus, the statement shown preloads all index blocks from
`t1`, but only blocks for the nonleaf nodes
from `t2`.

If an index has been assigned to a key cache using a
[`CACHE INDEX`](cache-index.md "15.7.8.2 CACHE INDEX Statement") statement,
preloading places index blocks into that cache. Otherwise, the
index is loaded into the default key cache.
