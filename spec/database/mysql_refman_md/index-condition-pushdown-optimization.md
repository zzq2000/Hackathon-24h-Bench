#### 10.2.1.6 Index Condition Pushdown Optimization

Index Condition Pushdown (ICP) is an optimization for the case
where MySQL retrieves rows from a table using an index.
Without ICP, the storage engine traverses the index to locate
rows in the base table and returns them to the MySQL server
which evaluates the `WHERE` condition for the
rows. With ICP enabled, and if parts of the
`WHERE` condition can be evaluated by using
only columns from the index, the MySQL server pushes this part
of the `WHERE` condition down to the storage
engine. The storage engine then evaluates the pushed index
condition by using the index entry and only if this is
satisfied is the row read from the table. ICP can reduce the
number of times the storage engine must access the base table
and the number of times the MySQL server must access the
storage engine.

Applicability of the Index Condition Pushdown optimization is
subject to these conditions:

- ICP is used for the
  [`range`](explain-output.md#jointype_range),
  [`ref`](explain-output.md#jointype_ref),
  [`eq_ref`](explain-output.md#jointype_eq_ref), and
  [`ref_or_null`](explain-output.md#jointype_ref_or_null) access
  methods when there is a need to access full table rows.
- ICP can be used for [`InnoDB`](innodb-storage-engine.md "Chapter 17 The InnoDB Storage Engine")
  and [`MyISAM`](myisam-storage-engine.md "18.2 The MyISAM Storage Engine") tables, including
  partitioned `InnoDB` and
  `MyISAM` tables.
- For `InnoDB` tables, ICP is used only for
  secondary indexes. The goal of ICP is to reduce the number
  of full-row reads and thereby reduce I/O operations. For
  `InnoDB` clustered indexes, the complete
  record is already read into the `InnoDB`
  buffer. Using ICP in this case does not reduce I/O.
- ICP is not supported with secondary indexes created on
  virtual generated columns. `InnoDB`
  supports secondary indexes on virtual generated columns.
- Conditions that refer to subqueries cannot be pushed down.
- Conditions that refer to stored functions cannot be pushed
  down. Storage engines cannot invoke stored functions.
- Triggered conditions cannot be pushed down. (For
  information about triggered conditions, see
  [Section 10.2.2.3, “Optimizing Subqueries with the EXISTS Strategy”](subquery-optimization-with-exists.md "10.2.2.3 Optimizing Subqueries with the EXISTS Strategy").)
- (*MySQL 8.0.30 and later*:) Conditions
  cannot be pushed down to derived tables containing
  references to system variables.

To understand how this optimization works, first consider how
an index scan proceeds when Index Condition Pushdown is not
used:

1. Get the next row, first by reading the index tuple, and
   then by using the index tuple to locate and read the full
   table row.
2. Test the part of the `WHERE` condition
   that applies to this table. Accept or reject the row based
   on the test result.

Using Index Condition Pushdown, the scan proceeds like this
instead:

1. Get the next row's index tuple (but not the full
   table row).
2. Test the part of the `WHERE` condition
   that applies to this table and can be checked using only
   index columns. If the condition is not satisfied, proceed
   to the index tuple for the next row.
3. If the condition is satisfied, use the index tuple to
   locate and read the full table row.
4. Test the remaining part of the `WHERE`
   condition that applies to this table. Accept or reject the
   row based on the test result.

[`EXPLAIN`](explain.md "15.8.2 EXPLAIN Statement") output shows
`Using index condition` in the
`Extra` column when Index Condition Pushdown
is used. It does not show `Using index`
because that does not apply when full table rows must be read.

Suppose that a table contains information about people and
their addresses and that the table has an index defined as
`INDEX (zipcode, lastname, firstname)`. If we
know a person's `zipcode` value but are
not sure about the last name, we can search like this:

```sql
SELECT * FROM people
  WHERE zipcode='95054'
  AND lastname LIKE '%etrunia%'
  AND address LIKE '%Main Street%';
```

MySQL can use the index to scan through people with
`zipcode='95054'`. The second part
(`lastname LIKE '%etrunia%'`) cannot be used
to limit the number of rows that must be scanned, so without
Index Condition Pushdown, this query must retrieve full table
rows for all people who have
`zipcode='95054'`.

With Index Condition Pushdown, MySQL checks the
`lastname LIKE '%etrunia%'` part before
reading the full table row. This avoids reading full rows
corresponding to index tuples that match the
`zipcode` condition but not the
`lastname` condition.

Index Condition Pushdown is enabled by default. It can be
controlled with the
[`optimizer_switch`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_optimizer_switch) system
variable by setting the
[`index_condition_pushdown`](switchable-optimizations.md#optflag_index-condition-pushdown)
flag:

```sql
SET optimizer_switch = 'index_condition_pushdown=off';
SET optimizer_switch = 'index_condition_pushdown=on';
```
