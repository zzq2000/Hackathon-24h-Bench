#### 10.2.2.1 Optimizing IN and EXISTS Subquery Predicates with Semijoin Transformations

A semijoin is a preparation-time transformation that enables
multiple execution strategies such as table pullout, duplicate
weedout, first match, loose scan, and materialization. The
optimizer uses semijoin strategies to improve subquery
execution, as described in this section.

For an inner join between two tables, the join returns a row
from one table as many times as there are matches in the other
table. But for some questions, the only information that
matters is whether there is a match, not the number of
matches. Suppose that there are tables named
`class` and `roster` that
list classes in a course curriculum and class rosters
(students enrolled in each class), respectively. To list the
classes that actually have students enrolled, you could use
this join:

```sql
SELECT class.class_num, class.class_name
    FROM class
    INNER JOIN roster
    WHERE class.class_num = roster.class_num;
```

However, the result lists each class once for each enrolled
student. For the question being asked, this is unnecessary
duplication of information.

Assuming that `class_num` is a primary key in
the `class` table, duplicate suppression is
possible by using
[`SELECT
DISTINCT`](select.md "15.2.13 SELECT Statement"), but it is inefficient to generate all
matching rows first only to eliminate duplicates later.

The same duplicate-free result can be obtained by using a
subquery:

```sql
SELECT class_num, class_name
    FROM class
    WHERE class_num IN
        (SELECT class_num FROM roster);
```

Here, the optimizer can recognize that the
`IN` clause requires the subquery to return
only one instance of each class number from the
`roster` table. In this case, the query can
use a semijoin; that is,
an operation that returns only one instance of each row in
`class` that is matched by rows in
`roster`.

The following statement, which contains an
`EXISTS` subquery predicate, is equivalent to
the previous statement containing an `IN`
subquery predicate:

```sql
SELECT class_num, class_name
    FROM class
    WHERE EXISTS
        (SELECT * FROM roster WHERE class.class_num = roster.class_num);
```

In MySQL 8.0.16 and later, any statement with an
`EXISTS` subquery predicate is subject to the
same semijoin transforms as a statement with an equivalent
`IN` subquery predicate.

Beginning with MySQL 8.0.17, the following subqueries are
transformed into antijoins:

- `NOT IN (SELECT ... FROM ...)`
- `NOT EXISTS (SELECT ... FROM ...)`.
- `IN (SELECT ... FROM ...) IS NOT TRUE`
- `EXISTS (SELECT ... FROM ...) IS NOT
  TRUE`.
- `IN (SELECT ... FROM ...) IS FALSE`
- `EXISTS (SELECT ... FROM ...) IS FALSE`.

In short, any negation of a subquery of the form `IN
(SELECT ... FROM ...)` or `EXISTS (SELECT ...
FROM ...)` is transformed into an antijoin.

An antijoin is an operation that returns only rows for which
there is no match. Consider the query shown here:

```sql
SELECT class_num, class_name
    FROM class
    WHERE class_num NOT IN
        (SELECT class_num FROM roster);
```

This query is rewritten internally as the antijoin
`SELECT class_num, class_name FROM class ANTIJOIN
roster ON class_num`, which returns one instance of
each row in `class` that is
*not* matched by any rows in
`roster`. This means that, for each row in
`class`, as soon as a match is found in
`roster`, the row in `class`
can be discarded.

Antijoin transformations cannot in most cases be applied if
the expressions being compared are nullable. An exception to
this rule is that `(... NOT IN (SELECT ...)) IS NOT
FALSE` and its equivalent `(... IN (SELECT
...)) IS NOT TRUE` can be transformed into antijoins.

Outer join and inner join syntax is permitted in the outer
query specification, and table references may be base tables,
derived tables, view references, or common table expressions.

In MySQL, a subquery must satisfy these criteria to be handled
as a semijoin (or, in MySQL 8.0.17 and later, an antijoin if
`NOT` modifies the subquery):

- It must be part of an `IN`, `=
  ANY`, or `EXISTS` predicate that
  appears at the top level of the `WHERE`
  or `ON` clause, possibly as a term in an
  `AND` expression. For example:

  ```sql
  SELECT ...
      FROM ot1, ...
      WHERE (oe1, ...) IN
          (SELECT ie1, ... FROM it1, ... WHERE ...);
  ```

  Here, `ot_i`
  and `it_i`
  represent tables in the outer and inner parts of the
  query, and
  `oe_i` and
  `ie_i`
  represent expressions that refer to columns in the outer
  and inner tables.

  In MySQL 8.0.17 and later, the subquery can also be the
  argument to an expression modified by
  `NOT`, `IS [NOT] TRUE`,
  or `IS [NOT] FALSE`.
- It must be a single [`SELECT`](select.md "15.2.13 SELECT Statement")
  without [`UNION`](union.md "15.2.18 UNION Clause") constructs.
- It must not contain a `HAVING` clause.
- It must not contain any aggregate functions (whether it is
  explicitly or implicitly grouped).
- It must not have a `LIMIT` clause.
- The statement must not use the
  `STRAIGHT_JOIN` join type in the outer
  query.
- The `STRAIGHT_JOIN` modifier must not be
  present.
- The number of outer and inner tables together must be less
  than the maximum number of tables permitted in a join.
- The subquery may be correlated or uncorrelated. In MySQL
  8.0.16 and later, decorrelation looks at trivially
  correlated predicates in the `WHERE`
  clause of a subquery used as the argument to
  `EXISTS`, and makes it possible to
  optimize it as if it was used within `IN (SELECT b
  FROM ...)`. The term *trivially
  correlated* means that the predicate is an
  equality predicate, that it is the sole predicate in the
  `WHERE` clause (or is combined with
  `AND`), and that one operand is from a
  table referenced in the subquery and the other operand is
  from the outer query block.
- The `DISTINCT` keyword is permitted but
  ignored. Semijoin strategies automatically handle
  duplicate removal.
- A `GROUP BY` clause is permitted but
  ignored, unless the subquery also contains one or more
  aggregate functions.
- An `ORDER BY` clause is permitted but
  ignored, since ordering is irrelevant to the evaluation of
  semijoin strategies.

If a subquery meets the preceding criteria, MySQL converts it
to a semijoin (or, in MySQL 8.0.17 or later, an antijoin if
applicable) and makes a cost-based choice from these
strategies:

- Convert the subquery to a join, or use table pullout and
  run the query as an inner join between subquery tables and
  outer tables. Table pullout pulls a table out from the
  subquery to the outer query.
- *Duplicate Weedout*: Run the semijoin
  as if it was a join and remove duplicate records using a
  temporary table.
- *FirstMatch*: When scanning the inner
  tables for row combinations and there are multiple
  instances of a given value group, choose one rather than
  returning them all. This "shortcuts" scanning and
  eliminates production of unnecessary rows.
- *LooseScan*: Scan a subquery table
  using an index that enables a single value to be chosen
  from each subquery's value group.
- Materialize the subquery into an indexed temporary table
  that is used to perform a join, where the index is used to
  remove duplicates. The index might also be used later for
  lookups when joining the temporary table with the outer
  tables; if not, the table is scanned. For more information
  about materialization, see
  [Section 10.2.2.2, “Optimizing Subqueries with Materialization”](subquery-materialization.md "10.2.2.2 Optimizing Subqueries with Materialization").

Each of these strategies can be enabled or disabled using the
following [`optimizer_switch`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_optimizer_switch)
system variable flags:

- The [`semijoin`](switchable-optimizations.md#optflag_semijoin) flag
  controls whether semijoins are used. Starting with MySQL
  8.0.17, this also applies to antijoins.
- If [`semijoin`](switchable-optimizations.md#optflag_semijoin) is enabled,
  the [`firstmatch`](switchable-optimizations.md#optflag_firstmatch),
  [`loosescan`](switchable-optimizations.md#optflag_loosescan),
  [`duplicateweedout`](switchable-optimizations.md#optflag_duplicateweedout), and
  [`materialization`](switchable-optimizations.md#optflag_materialization) flags
  enable finer control over the permitted semijoin
  strategies.
- If the [`duplicateweedout`](switchable-optimizations.md#optflag_duplicateweedout)
  semijoin strategy is disabled, it is not used unless all
  other applicable strategies are also disabled.
- If [`duplicateweedout`](switchable-optimizations.md#optflag_duplicateweedout) is
  disabled, on occasion the optimizer may generate a query
  plan that is far from optimal. This occurs due to
  heuristic pruning during greedy search, which can be
  avoided by setting
  [`optimizer_prune_level=0`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_optimizer_prune_level).

These flags are enabled by default. See
[Section 10.9.2, “Switchable Optimizations”](switchable-optimizations.md "10.9.2 Switchable Optimizations").

The optimizer minimizes differences in handling of views and
derived tables. This affects queries that use the
`STRAIGHT_JOIN` modifier and a view with an
`IN` subquery that can be converted to a
semijoin. The following query illustrates this because the
change in processing causes a change in transformation, and
thus a different execution strategy:

```sql
CREATE VIEW v AS
SELECT *
FROM t1
WHERE a IN (SELECT b
           FROM t2);

SELECT STRAIGHT_JOIN *
FROM t3 JOIN v ON t3.x = v.a;
```

The optimizer first looks at the view and converts the
`IN` subquery to a semijoin, then checks
whether it is possible to merge the view into the outer query.
Because the `STRAIGHT_JOIN` modifier in the
outer query prevents semijoin, the optimizer refuses the
merge, causing derived table evaluation using a materialized
table.

[`EXPLAIN`](explain.md "15.8.2 EXPLAIN Statement") output indicates the
use of semijoin strategies as follows:

- For extended [`EXPLAIN`](explain.md "15.8.2 EXPLAIN Statement")
  output, the text displayed by a following
  [`SHOW WARNINGS`](show-warnings.md "15.7.7.42 SHOW WARNINGS Statement") shows the
  rewritten query, which displays the semijoin structure.
  (See [Section 10.8.3, “Extended EXPLAIN Output Format”](explain-extended.md "10.8.3 Extended EXPLAIN Output Format").) From this you
  can get an idea about which tables were pulled out of the
  semijoin. If a subquery was converted to a semijoin, you
  should see that the subquery predicate is gone and its
  tables and `WHERE` clause were merged
  into the outer query join list and
  `WHERE` clause.
- Temporary table use for Duplicate Weedout is indicated by
  `Start temporary` and `End
  temporary` in the `Extra`
  column. Tables that were not pulled out and are in the
  range of [`EXPLAIN`](explain.md "15.8.2 EXPLAIN Statement") output
  rows covered by `Start temporary` and
  `End temporary` have their
  `rowid` in the temporary table.
- `FirstMatch(tbl_name)`
  in the `Extra` column indicates join
  shortcutting.
- `LooseScan(m..n)`
  in the `Extra` column indicates use of
  the LooseScan strategy. *`m`* and
  *`n`* are key part numbers.
- Temporary table use for materialization is indicated by
  rows with a `select_type` value of
  `MATERIALIZED` and rows with a
  `table` value of
  `<subqueryN>`.

In MySQL 8.0.21 and later, a semijoin transformation can also
be applied to a single-table
[`UPDATE`](update.md "15.2.17 UPDATE Statement") or
[`DELETE`](delete.md "15.2.2 DELETE Statement") statement that uses a
`[NOT] IN` or `[NOT] EXISTS`
subquery predicate, provided that the statement does not use
`ORDER BY` or `LIMIT`, and
that semijoin transformations are allowed by an optimizer hint
or by the [`optimizer_switch`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_optimizer_switch)
setting.
