#### 19.3.3.3 Recovering From Failed Replication Privilege Checks

If a privilege check against the
`PRIVILEGE_CHECKS_USER` account fails, the
transaction is not executed and replication stops for the
channel. Details of the error and the last applied transaction
are recorded in the Performance Schema
[`replication_applier_status_by_worker`](performance-schema-replication-applier-status-by-worker-table.md "29.12.11.5 The replication_applier_status_by_worker Table")
table. Follow this procedure to recover from the error:

1. Identify the replicated event that caused the error and
   verify whether or not the event is expected and from a
   trusted source. You can use [**mysqlbinlog**](mysqlbinlog.md "6.6.9 mysqlbinlog — Utility for Processing Binary Log Files")
   to retrieve and display the events that were logged around
   the time of the error. For instructions to do this, see
   [Section 9.5, “Point-in-Time (Incremental) Recovery”](point-in-time-recovery.md "9.5 Point-in-Time (Incremental) Recovery").
2. If the replicated event is not expected or is not from a
   known and trusted source, investigate the cause. If you can
   identify why the event took place and there are no security
   considerations, proceed to fix the error as described below.
3. If the `PRIVILEGE_CHECKS_USER` account
   should have been permitted to execute the transaction, but
   has been misconfigured, grant the missing privileges to the
   account, use a [`FLUSH
   PRIVILEGES`](flush.md#flush-privileges) statement or execute a
   [**mysqladmin flush-privileges**](mysqladmin.md "6.5.2 mysqladmin — A MySQL Server Administration Program") or
   [**mysqladmin reload**](mysqladmin.md "6.5.2 mysqladmin — A MySQL Server Administration Program") command to reload the
   grant tables, then restart replication for the channel.
4. If the transaction needs to be executed and you have
   verified that it is trusted, but the
   `PRIVILEGE_CHECKS_USER` account should not
   have this privilege normally, you can grant the required
   privilege to the `PRIVILEGE_CHECKS_USER`
   account temporarily. After the replicated event has been
   applied, remove the privilege from the account, and take any
   necessary steps to ensure the event does not recur if it is
   avoidable.
5. If the transaction is an administrative action that should
   only have taken place on the source and not on the replica,
   or should only have taken place on a single replication
   group member, skip the transaction on the server or servers
   where it stopped replication, then issue
   [`START REPLICA`](start-replica.md "15.4.2.6 START REPLICA Statement") to restart
   replication on the channel. To avoid the situation in
   future, you could issue such administrative statements with
   `SET sql_log_bin = 0` before them and
   `SET sql_log_bin = 1` after them, so that
   they are not logged on the source.
6. If the transaction is a DDL or DML statement that should not
   have taken place on either the source or the replica, skip
   the transaction on the server or servers where it stopped
   replication, undo the transaction manually on the server
   where it originally took place, then issue
   [`START REPLICA`](start-replica.md "15.4.2.6 START REPLICA Statement") to restart
   replication.

To skip a transaction, if GTIDs are in use, commit an empty
transaction that has the GTID of the failing transaction, for
example:

```sql
SET GTID_NEXT='aaa-bbb-ccc-ddd:N';
BEGIN;
COMMIT;
SET GTID_NEXT='AUTOMATIC';
```

If GTIDs are not in use, issue a `SET GLOBAL
sql_replica_skip_counter` or `SET GLOBAL
sql_slave_skip_counter` statement to skip the event.
For instructions to use this alternative method and more details
about skipping transactions, see
[Section 19.1.7.3, “Skipping Transactions”](replication-administration-skip.md "19.1.7.3 Skipping Transactions").
