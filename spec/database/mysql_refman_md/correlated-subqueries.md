#### 15.2.15.7 Correlated Subqueries

A *correlated subquery* is a subquery that
contains a reference to a table that also appears in the outer
query. For example:

```sql
SELECT * FROM t1
  WHERE column1 = ANY (SELECT column1 FROM t2
                       WHERE t2.column2 = t1.column2);
```

Notice that the subquery contains a reference to a column of
`t1`, even though the subquery's
`FROM` clause does not mention a table
`t1`. So, MySQL looks outside the subquery, and
finds `t1` in the outer query.

Suppose that table `t1` contains a row where
`column1 = 5` and `column2 =
6`; meanwhile, table `t2` contains a
row where `column1 = 5` and `column2 =
7`. The simple expression `... WHERE column1 =
ANY (SELECT column1 FROM t2)` would be
`TRUE`, but in this example, the
`WHERE` clause within the subquery is
`FALSE` (because `(5,6)` is
not equal to `(5,7)`), so the expression as a
whole is `FALSE`.

**Scoping rule:** MySQL evaluates
from inside to outside. For example:

```sql
SELECT column1 FROM t1 AS x
  WHERE x.column1 = (SELECT column1 FROM t2 AS x
    WHERE x.column1 = (SELECT column1 FROM t3
      WHERE x.column2 = t3.column1));
```

In this statement, `x.column2` must be a column
in table `t2` because `SELECT column1
FROM t2 AS x ...` renames `t2`. It is
not a column in table `t1` because
`SELECT column1 FROM t1 ...` is an outer query
that is *farther out*.

Beginning with MySQL 8.0.24, the optimizer can transform a
correlated scalar subquery to a derived table when the
[`subquery_to_derived`](switchable-optimizations.md#optflag_subquery-to-derived) flag of
the [`optimizer_switch`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_optimizer_switch) variable
is enabled. Consider the query shown here:

```sql
SELECT * FROM t1
    WHERE ( SELECT a FROM t2
              WHERE t2.a=t1.a ) > 0;
```

To avoid materializing several times for a given derived table,
we can instead materialize—once—a derived table
which adds a grouping on the join column from the table
referenced in the inner query (`t2.a`) and then
an outer join on the lifted predicate (`t1.a =
derived.a`) in order to select the correct group to
match up with the outer row. (If the subquery already has an
explicit grouping, the extra grouping is added to the end of the
grouping list.) The query previously shown can thus be rewritten
like this:

```sql
SELECT t1.* FROM t1
    LEFT OUTER JOIN
        (SELECT a, COUNT(*) AS ct FROM t2 GROUP BY a) AS derived
    ON  t1.a = derived.a
        AND
        REJECT_IF(
            (ct > 1),
            "ERROR 1242 (21000): Subquery returns more than 1 row"
            )
    WHERE derived.a > 0;
```

In the rewritten query, `REJECT_IF()`
represents an internal function which tests a given condition
(here, the comparison `ct > 1`) and raises a
given error (in this case,
[`ER_SUBQUERY_NO_1_ROW`](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/mysql-errors/8.0/en/server-error-reference.html#error_er_subquery_no_1_row)) if the
condition is true. This reflects the cardinality check that the
optimizer performs as part of evaluating the
`JOIN` or `WHERE` clause,
prior to evaluating any lifted predicate, which is done only if
the subquery does not return more than one row.

This type of transformation can be performed, provided the
following conditions are met:

- The subquery can be part of a
  [`SELECT`](select.md "15.2.13 SELECT Statement") list,
  `WHERE` condition, or
  `HAVING` condition, but cannot be part of a
  [`JOIN`](join.md "15.2.13.2 JOIN Clause") condition, and cannot
  contain a `LIMIT` or
  `OFFSET` clause. In addition, the subquery
  cannot contain any set operations such as
  [`UNION`](union.md "15.2.18 UNION Clause").
- The `WHERE` clause may contain one or more
  predicates, combined with `AND`. If the
  `WHERE` clause contains an
  `OR` clause, it cannot be transformed. At
  least one of the `WHERE` clause predicates
  must be eligible for transformation, and none of them may
  reject transformation.
- To be eligible for transformation, a
  `WHERE` clause predicate must be an
  equality predicate in which each operand should be a simple
  column reference. No other predicates—including other
  comparison predicates—are eligible for transformation.
  The predicate must employ the equality operator
  [`=`](comparison-operators.md#operator_equal) for making
  the comparison; the null-safe
  [`<=>`](comparison-operators.md#operator_equal-to)
  operator is not supported in this context.
- A `WHERE` clause predicate that contains
  only inner references is not eligible for transformation,
  since it can be evaluated before the grouping. A
  `WHERE` clause predicate that contains only
  outer references is eligible for transformation, even though
  it can be lifted up to the outer query block. This is made
  possible by adding a cardinality check without grouping in
  the derived table.
- To be eligible, a `WHERE` clause predicate
  must have one operand that contains only inner references
  and one operand that contains only outer references. If the
  predicate is not eligible due to this rule, transformation
  of the query is rejected.
- A correlated column can be present only in the
  subquery's `WHERE` clause (and not in
  the `SELECT` list, a
  `JOIN` or `ORDER BY`
  clause, a `GROUP BY` list, or a
  `HAVING` clause). Nor can there be any
  correlated column inside a derived table in the
  subquery's `FROM` list.
- A correlated column can not be contained in an aggregate
  function's list of arguments.
- A correlated column must be resolved in the query block
  directly containing the subquery being considered for
  transformation.
- A correlated column cannot be present in a nested scalar
  subquery in the `WHERE` clause.
- The subquery cannot contain any window functions, and must
  not contain any aggregate function which aggregates in a
  query block outer to the subquery. A
  [`COUNT()`](aggregate-functions.md#function_count) aggregate function,
  if contained in the `SELECT` list element
  of the subquery, must be at the topmost level, and cannot be
  part of an expression.
