### 2.8.6 Configuring SSL Library Support

An SSL library is required for support of encrypted connections,
entropy for random number generation, and other encryption-related
operations.

If you compile MySQL from a source distribution,
**CMake** configures the distribution to use the
installed OpenSSL library by default.

To compile using OpenSSL, use this procedure:

1. Ensure that OpenSSL 1.0.1 or newer is installed on your
   system. If the installed OpenSSL version is older than 1.0.1,
   **CMake** produces an error at MySQL
   configuration time. If it is necessary to obtain OpenSSL,
   visit <http://www.openssl.org>.
2. The [`WITH_SSL`](source-configuration-options.md#option_cmake_with_ssl)
   **CMake** option determines which SSL library
   to use for compiling MySQL (see
   [Section 2.8.7, “MySQL Source-Configuration Options”](source-configuration-options.md "2.8.7 MySQL Source-Configuration Options")). The default
   is [`-DWITH_SSL=system`](source-configuration-options.md#option_cmake_with_ssl), which uses
   OpenSSL. To make this explicit, specify that option. For
   example:

   ```terminal
   cmake . -DWITH_SSL=system
   ```

   That command configures the distribution to use the installed
   OpenSSL library. Alternatively, to explicitly specify the path
   name to the OpenSSL installation, use the following syntax.
   This can be useful if you have multiple versions of OpenSSL
   installed, to prevent **CMake** from choosing
   the wrong one:

   ```terminal
   cmake . -DWITH_SSL=path_name
   ```

   Alternative OpenSSL system packages are supported as of MySQL
   8.0.30 by using `WITH_SSL=openssl11` on EL7 or
   `WITH_SSL=openssl3` on EL8. Authentication
   plugins, such as LDAP and Kerberos, are disabled since they do
   not support these alternative versions of OpenSSL.
3. Compile and install the distribution.

To check whether a [**mysqld**](mysqld.md "6.3.1 mysqld — The MySQL Server") server supports
encrypted connections, examine the value of the
[`have_ssl`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_have_ssl) system variable:

```sql
mysql> SHOW VARIABLES LIKE 'have_ssl';
+---------------+-------+
| Variable_name | Value |
+---------------+-------+
| have_ssl      | YES   |
+---------------+-------+
```

If the value is `YES`, the server supports
encrypted connections. If the value is
`DISABLED`, the server is capable of supporting
encrypted connections but was not started with the appropriate
`--ssl-xxx` options to
enable encrypted connections to be used; see
[Section 8.3.1, “Configuring MySQL to Use Encrypted Connections”](using-encrypted-connections.md "8.3.1 Configuring MySQL to Use Encrypted Connections").
