### 10.14.6 Replication SQL Thread States

The following list shows the most common states you may see in
the `State` column for a replication SQL thread
on a replica server.

In MySQL 8.0.26, incompatible changes were made to
instrumentation names, including the names of thread stages,
containing the terms “master”, which is changed to
“source”, “slave”, which is changed to
“replica”, and “mts” (for
“multithreaded slave”), which is changed to
“mta” (for “multithreaded applier”).
Monitoring tools that work with these instrumentation names
might be impacted. If the incompatible changes have an impact
for you, set the
[`terminology_use_previous`](replication-options-replica.md#sysvar_terminology_use_previous) system
variable to `BEFORE_8_0_26` to make MySQL
Server use the old versions of the names for the objects
specified in the previous list. This enables monitoring tools
that rely on the old names to continue working until they can be
updated to use the new names.

Set the
[`terminology_use_previous`](replication-options-replica.md#sysvar_terminology_use_previous) system
variable with session scope to support individual functions, or
global scope to be a default for all new sessions. When global
scope is used, the slow query log contains the old versions of
the names.

- `Making temporary file (append) before replaying
  LOAD DATA INFILE`

  The thread is executing a [`LOAD
  DATA`](load-data.md "15.2.9 LOAD DATA Statement") statement and is appending the data to a
  temporary file containing the data from which the replica
  reads rows.
- `Making temporary file (create) before replaying
  LOAD DATA INFILE`

  The thread is executing a [`LOAD
  DATA`](load-data.md "15.2.9 LOAD DATA Statement") statement and is creating a temporary file
  containing the data from which the replica reads rows. This
  state can only be encountered if the original
  [`LOAD DATA`](load-data.md "15.2.9 LOAD DATA Statement") statement was
  logged by a source running a version of MySQL lower than
  MySQL 5.0.3.
- `Reading event from the relay log`

  The thread has read an event from the relay log so that the
  event can be processed.
- `Slave has read all relay log; waiting for more
  updates`

  From MySQL 8.0.26: `Replica has read all relay log;
  waiting for more updates`

  The thread has processed all events in the relay log files,
  and is now waiting for the I/O (receiver) thread to write
  new events to the relay log.
- `Waiting for an event from Coordinator`

  Using the multithreaded replica
  ([`replica_parallel_workers`](replication-options-replica.md#sysvar_replica_parallel_workers)
  or [`slave_parallel_workers`](replication-options-replica.md#sysvar_slave_parallel_workers)
  is greater than 1), one of the replica worker threads is
  waiting for an event from the coordinator thread.
- `Waiting for slave mutex on exit`

  From MySQL 8.0.26: `Waiting for replica mutex on
  exit`

  A very brief state that occurs as the thread is stopping.
- `Waiting for Slave Workers to free pending
  events`

  From MySQL 8.0.26: `Waiting for Replica Workers to
  free pending events`

  This waiting action occurs when the total size of events
  being processed by Workers exceeds the size of the
  [`replica_pending_jobs_size_max`](replication-options-replica.md#sysvar_replica_pending_jobs_size_max)
  or
  [`slave_pending_jobs_size_max`](replication-options-replica.md#sysvar_slave_pending_jobs_size_max)
  system variable. The Coordinator resumes scheduling when the
  size drops below this limit. This state occurs only when
  [`replica_parallel_workers`](replication-options-replica.md#sysvar_replica_parallel_workers) or
  [`slave_parallel_workers`](replication-options-replica.md#sysvar_slave_parallel_workers) is
  set greater than 0.
- `Waiting for the next event in relay log`

  The initial state before `Reading event from the
  relay log`.
- `Waiting until MASTER_DELAY seconds after master
  executed event`

  From MySQL 8.0.26: `Waiting until SOURCE_DELAY
  seconds after master executed event`

  The SQL thread has read an event but is waiting for the
  replica delay to lapse. This delay is set with the
  `SOURCE_DELAY` |
  `MASTER_DELAY` option of the
  [`CHANGE REPLICATION SOURCE TO`](change-replication-source-to.md "15.4.2.3 CHANGE REPLICATION SOURCE TO Statement")
  statement (from MySQL 8.0.23) or [`CHANGE
  MASTER TO`](change-master-to.md "15.4.2.1 CHANGE MASTER TO Statement") statement (before MySQL 8.0.23).

The `Info` column for the SQL thread may also
show the text of a statement. This indicates that the thread has
read an event from the relay log, extracted the statement from
it, and may be executing it.
