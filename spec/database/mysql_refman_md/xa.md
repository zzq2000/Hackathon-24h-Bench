### 15.3.8 XA Transactions

[15.3.8.1 XA Transaction SQL Statements](xa-statements.md)

[15.3.8.2 XA Transaction States](xa-states.md)

[15.3.8.3 Restrictions on XA Transactions](xa-restrictions.md)

Support for [XA](glossary.md#glos_xa "XA") transactions is
available for the [`InnoDB`](innodb-storage-engine.md "Chapter 17 The InnoDB Storage Engine") storage
engine. The MySQL XA implementation is based on the X/Open CAE
document *Distributed Transaction Processing: The XA
Specification*. This document is published by The Open
Group and available at
<http://www.opengroup.org/public/pubs/catalog/c193.htm>.
Limitations of the current XA implementation are described in
[Section 15.3.8.3, “Restrictions on XA Transactions”](xa-restrictions.md "15.3.8.3 Restrictions on XA Transactions").

On the client side, there are no special requirements. The XA
interface to a MySQL server consists of SQL statements that begin
with the `XA` keyword. MySQL client programs must
be able to send SQL statements and to understand the semantics of
the XA statement interface. They do not need be linked against a
recent client library. Older client libraries also work.

Among the MySQL Connectors, MySQL Connector/J 5.0.0 and higher
supports XA directly, by means of a class interface that handles
the XA SQL statement interface for you.

XA supports distributed transactions, that is, the ability to
permit multiple separate transactional resources to participate in
a global transaction. Transactional resources often are RDBMSs but
may be other kinds of resources.

A global transaction involves several actions that are
transactional in themselves, but that all must either complete
successfully as a group, or all be rolled back as a group. In
essence, this extends ACID properties “up a level” so
that multiple ACID transactions can be executed in concert as
components of a global operation that also has ACID properties.
(As with nondistributed transactions,
[`SERIALIZABLE`](innodb-transaction-isolation-levels.md#isolevel_serializable) may be preferred
if your applications are sensitive to read phenomena.
[`REPEATABLE READ`](innodb-transaction-isolation-levels.md#isolevel_repeatable-read) may not be
sufficient for distributed transactions.)

Some examples of distributed transactions:

- An application may act as an integration tool that combines a
  messaging service with an RDBMS. The application makes sure
  that transactions dealing with message sending, retrieval, and
  processing that also involve a transactional database all
  happen in a global transaction. You can think of this as
  “transactional email.”
- An application performs actions that involve different
  database servers, such as a MySQL server and an Oracle server
  (or multiple MySQL servers), where actions that involve
  multiple servers must happen as part of a global transaction,
  rather than as separate transactions local to each server.
- A bank keeps account information in an RDBMS and distributes
  and receives money through automated teller machines (ATMs).
  It is necessary to ensure that ATM actions are correctly
  reflected in the accounts, but this cannot be done with the
  RDBMS alone. A global transaction manager integrates the ATM
  and database resources to ensure overall consistency of
  financial transactions.

Applications that use global transactions involve one or more
Resource Managers and a Transaction Manager:

- A Resource Manager (RM) provides access to transactional
  resources. A database server is one kind of resource manager.
  It must be possible to either commit or roll back transactions
  managed by the RM.
- A Transaction Manager (TM) coordinates the transactions that
  are part of a global transaction. It communicates with the RMs
  that handle each of these transactions. The individual
  transactions within a global transaction are
  “branches” of the global transaction. Global
  transactions and their branches are identified by a naming
  scheme described later.

The MySQL implementation of XA enables a MySQL server to act as a
Resource Manager that handles XA transactions within a global
transaction. A client program that connects to the MySQL server
acts as the Transaction Manager.

To carry out a global transaction, it is necessary to know which
components are involved, and bring each component to a point when
it can be committed or rolled back. Depending on what each
component reports about its ability to succeed, they must all
commit or roll back as an atomic group. That is, either all
components must commit, or all components must roll back. To
manage a global transaction, it is necessary to take into account
that any component or the connecting network might fail.

The process for executing a global transaction uses two-phase
commit (2PC). This takes place after the actions performed by the
branches of the global transaction have been executed.

1. In the first phase, all branches are prepared. That is, they
   are told by the TM to get ready to commit. Typically, this
   means each RM that manages a branch records the actions for
   the branch in stable storage. The branches indicate whether
   they are able to do this, and these results are used for the
   second phase.
2. In the second phase, the TM tells the RMs whether to commit or
   roll back. If all branches indicated when they were prepared
   that they were able to commit, all branches are told to
   commit. If any branch indicated when it was prepared that it
   was not able to commit, all branches are told to roll back.

In some cases, a global transaction might use one-phase commit
(1PC). For example, when a Transaction Manager finds that a global
transaction consists of only one transactional resource (that is,
a single branch), that resource can be told to prepare and commit
at the same time.
