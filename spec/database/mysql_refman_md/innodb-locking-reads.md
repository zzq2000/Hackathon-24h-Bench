#### 17.7.2.4 Locking Reads

If you query data and then insert or update related data within
the same transaction, the regular `SELECT`
statement does not give enough protection. Other transactions
can update or delete the same rows you just queried.
`InnoDB` supports two types of
[locking reads](glossary.md#glos_locking_read "locking read") that
offer extra safety:

- [`SELECT ... FOR
  SHARE`](select.md "15.2.13 SELECT Statement")

  Sets a shared mode lock on any rows that are read. Other
  sessions can read the rows, but cannot modify them until
  your transaction commits. If any of these rows were changed
  by another transaction that has not yet committed, your
  query waits until that transaction ends and then uses the
  latest values.

  Note

  `SELECT ... FOR SHARE` is a replacement
  for `SELECT ... LOCK IN SHARE MODE`, but
  `LOCK IN SHARE MODE` remains available
  for backward compatibility. The statements are equivalent.
  However, `FOR SHARE` supports `OF
  table_name`,
  `NOWAIT`, and `SKIP
  LOCKED` options. See
  [Locking Read Concurrency with NOWAIT and SKIP LOCKED](innodb-locking-reads.md#innodb-locking-reads-nowait-skip-locked "Locking Read Concurrency with NOWAIT and SKIP LOCKED").

  Prior to MySQL 8.0.22, `SELECT ... FOR
  SHARE` requires the
  [`SELECT`](privileges-provided.md#priv_select) privilege and at least
  one of the [`DELETE`](privileges-provided.md#priv_delete),
  [`LOCK TABLES`](privileges-provided.md#priv_lock-tables), or
  [`UPDATE`](privileges-provided.md#priv_update) privileges. From MySQL
  8.0.22, only the [`SELECT`](privileges-provided.md#priv_select)
  privilege is required.

  From MySQL 8.0.22, `SELECT ... FOR SHARE`
  statements do not acquire read locks on MySQL grant tables.
  For more information, see
  [Grant Table Concurrency](grant-tables.md#grant-tables-concurrency "Grant Table Concurrency").
- [`SELECT ... FOR
  UPDATE`](select.md "15.2.13 SELECT Statement")

  For index records the search encounters, locks the rows and
  any associated index entries, the same as if you issued an
  `UPDATE` statement for those rows. Other
  transactions are blocked from updating those rows, from
  doing `SELECT ... FOR SHARE`, or from
  reading the data in certain transaction isolation levels.
  Consistent reads ignore any locks set on the records that
  exist in the read view. (Old versions of a record cannot be
  locked; they are reconstructed by applying
  [undo logs](glossary.md#glos_undo_log "undo log") on an
  in-memory copy of the record.)

  `SELECT ... FOR UPDATE` requires the
  [`SELECT`](privileges-provided.md#priv_select) privilege and at least
  one of the [`DELETE`](privileges-provided.md#priv_delete),
  [`LOCK TABLES`](privileges-provided.md#priv_lock-tables), or
  [`UPDATE`](privileges-provided.md#priv_update) privileges.

These clauses are primarily useful when dealing with
tree-structured or graph-structured data, either in a single
table or split across multiple tables. You traverse edges or
tree branches from one place to another, while reserving the
right to come back and change any of these
“pointer” values.

All locks set by `FOR SHARE` and `FOR
UPDATE` queries are released when the transaction is
committed or rolled back.

Note

Locking reads are only possible when autocommit is disabled
(either by beginning transaction with
[`START
TRANSACTION`](commit.md "15.3.1 START TRANSACTION, COMMIT, and ROLLBACK Statements") or by setting
[`autocommit`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_autocommit) to 0.

A locking read clause in an outer statement does not lock the
rows of a table in a nested subquery unless a locking read
clause is also specified in the subquery. For example, the
following statement does not lock rows in table
`t2`.

```sql
SELECT * FROM t1 WHERE c1 = (SELECT c1 FROM t2) FOR UPDATE;
```

To lock rows in table `t2`, add a locking read
clause to the subquery:

```sql
SELECT * FROM t1 WHERE c1 = (SELECT c1 FROM t2 FOR UPDATE) FOR UPDATE;
```

##### Locking Read Examples

Suppose that you want to insert a new row into a table
`child`, and make sure that the child row has
a parent row in table `parent`. Your
application code can ensure referential integrity throughout
this sequence of operations.

First, use a consistent read to query the table
`PARENT` and verify that the parent row
exists. Can you safely insert the child row to table
`CHILD`? No, because some other session could
delete the parent row in the moment between your
`SELECT` and your `INSERT`,
without you being aware of it.

To avoid this potential issue, perform the
[`SELECT`](select.md "15.2.13 SELECT Statement") using `FOR
SHARE`:

```sql
SELECT * FROM parent WHERE NAME = 'Jones' FOR SHARE;
```

After the `FOR SHARE` query returns the
parent `'Jones'`, you can safely add the
child record to the `CHILD` table and commit
the transaction. Any transaction that tries to acquire an
exclusive lock in the applicable row in the
`PARENT` table waits until you are finished,
that is, until the data in all tables is in a consistent
state.

For another example, consider an integer counter field in a
table `CHILD_CODES`, used to assign a unique
identifier to each child added to table
`CHILD`. Do not use either consistent read or
a shared mode read to read the present value of the counter,
because two users of the database could see the same value for
the counter, and a duplicate-key error occurs if two
transactions attempt to add rows with the same identifier to
the `CHILD` table.

Here, `FOR SHARE` is not a good solution
because if two users read the counter at the same time, at
least one of them ends up in deadlock when it attempts to
update the counter.

To implement reading and incrementing the counter, first
perform a locking read of the counter using `FOR
UPDATE`, and then increment the counter. For example:

```sql
SELECT counter_field FROM child_codes FOR UPDATE;
UPDATE child_codes SET counter_field = counter_field + 1;
```

A [`SELECT ... FOR
UPDATE`](select.md "15.2.13 SELECT Statement") reads the latest available data, setting
exclusive locks on each row it reads. Thus, it sets the same
locks a searched SQL [`UPDATE`](update.md "15.2.17 UPDATE Statement")
would set on the rows.

The preceding description is merely an example of how
[`SELECT ... FOR
UPDATE`](select.md "15.2.13 SELECT Statement") works. In MySQL, the specific task of
generating a unique identifier actually can be accomplished
using only a single access to the table:

```sql
UPDATE child_codes SET counter_field = LAST_INSERT_ID(counter_field + 1);
SELECT LAST_INSERT_ID();
```

The [`SELECT`](select.md "15.2.13 SELECT Statement") statement merely
retrieves the identifier information (specific to the current
connection). It does not access any table.

##### Locking Read Concurrency with NOWAIT and SKIP LOCKED

If a row is locked by a transaction, a `SELECT ... FOR
UPDATE` or `SELECT ... FOR SHARE`
transaction that requests the same locked row must wait until
the blocking transaction releases the row lock. This behavior
prevents transactions from updating or deleting rows that are
queried for updates by other transactions. However, waiting
for a row lock to be released is not necessary if you want the
query to return immediately when a requested row is locked, or
if excluding locked rows from the result set is acceptable.

To avoid waiting for other transactions to release row locks,
`NOWAIT` and `SKIP LOCKED`
options may be used with `SELECT ... FOR
UPDATE` or `SELECT ... FOR SHARE`
locking read statements.

- `NOWAIT`

  A locking read that uses `NOWAIT` never
  waits to acquire a row lock. The query executes
  immediately, failing with an error if a requested row is
  locked.
- `SKIP LOCKED`

  A locking read that uses `SKIP LOCKED`
  never waits to acquire a row lock. The query executes
  immediately, removing locked rows from the result set.

  Note

  Queries that skip locked rows return an inconsistent
  view of the data. `SKIP LOCKED` is
  therefore not suitable for general transactional work.
  However, it may be used to avoid lock contention when
  multiple sessions access the same queue-like table.

`NOWAIT` and `SKIP LOCKED`
only apply to row-level locks.

Statements that use `NOWAIT` or `SKIP
LOCKED` are unsafe for statement based replication.

The following example demonstrates `NOWAIT`
and `SKIP LOCKED`. Session 1 starts a
transaction that takes a row lock on a single record. Session
2 attempts a locking read on the same record using the
`NOWAIT` option. Because the requested row is
locked by Session 1, the locking read returns immediately with
an error. In Session 3, the locking read with `SKIP
LOCKED` returns the requested rows except for the row
that is locked by Session 1.

```sql
# Session 1:

mysql> CREATE TABLE t (i INT, PRIMARY KEY (i)) ENGINE = InnoDB;

mysql> INSERT INTO t (i) VALUES(1),(2),(3);

mysql> START TRANSACTION;

mysql> SELECT * FROM t WHERE i = 2 FOR UPDATE;
+---+
| i |
+---+
| 2 |
+---+

# Session 2:

mysql> START TRANSACTION;

mysql> SELECT * FROM t WHERE i = 2 FOR UPDATE NOWAIT;
ERROR 3572 (HY000): Do not wait for lock.

# Session 3:

mysql> START TRANSACTION;

mysql> SELECT * FROM t FOR UPDATE SKIP LOCKED;
+---+
| i |
+---+
| 1 |
| 3 |
+---+
```
