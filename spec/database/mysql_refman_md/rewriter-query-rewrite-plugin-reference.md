#### 7.6.4.3 Rewriter Query Rewrite Plugin Reference

The following discussion serves as a reference to these elements
associated with the `Rewriter` query rewrite
plugin:

- The `Rewriter` rules table in the
  `query_rewrite` database
- `Rewriter` procedures and functions
- `Rewriter` system and status variables

##### 7.6.4.3.1 Rewriter Query Rewrite Plugin Rules Table

The `rewrite_rules` table in the
`query_rewrite` database provides persistent
storage for the rules that the `Rewriter`
plugin uses to decide whether to rewrite statements.

Users communicate with the plugin by modifying the set of
rules stored in this table. The plugin communicates
information to users by setting the table's
`message` column.

Note

The rules table is loaded into the plugin by the
`flush_rewrite_rules` stored procedure.
Unless that procedure has been called following the most
recent table modification, the table contents do not
necessarily correspond to the set of rules the plugin is
using.

The `rewrite_rules` table has these columns:

- `id`

  The rule ID. This column is the table primary key. You can
  use the ID to uniquely identify any rule.
- `pattern`

  The template that indicates the pattern for statements
  that the rule matches. Use `?` to
  represent parameter markers that match data values.
- `pattern_database`

  The database used to match unqualified table names in
  statements. Qualified table names in statements match
  qualified names in the pattern if corresponding database
  and table names are identical. Unqualified table names in
  statements match unqualified names in the pattern only if
  the default database is the same as
  `pattern_database` and the table names
  are identical.
- `replacement`

  The template that indicates how to rewrite statements
  matching the `pattern` column value. Use
  `?` to represent parameter markers that
  match data values. In rewritten statements, the plugin
  replaces `?` parameter markers in
  `replacement` using data values matched
  by the corresponding markers in
  `pattern`.
- `enabled`

  Whether the rule is enabled. Load operations (performed by
  invoking the `flush_rewrite_rules()`
  stored procedure) load the rule from the table into the
  `Rewriter` in-memory cache only if this
  column is `YES`.

  This column makes it possible to deactivate a rule without
  removing it: Set the column to a value other than
  `YES` and reload the table into the
  plugin.
- `message`

  The plugin uses this column for communicating with users.
  If no error occurs when the rules table is loaded into
  memory, the plugin sets the `message`
  column to `NULL`. A
  non-`NULL` value indicates an error and
  the column contents are the error message. Errors can
  occur under these circumstances:

  - Either the pattern or the replacement is an incorrect
    SQL statement that produces syntax errors.
  - The replacement contains more `?`
    parameter markers than the pattern.

  If a load error occurs, the plugin also sets the
  [`Rewriter_reload_error`](rewriter-query-rewrite-plugin-reference.md#statvar_Rewriter_reload_error)
  status variable to `ON`.
- `pattern_digest`

  This column is used for debugging and diagnostics. If the
  column exists when the rules table is loaded into memory,
  the plugin updates it with the pattern digest. This column
  may be useful if you are trying to determine why some
  statement fails to be rewritten.
- `normalized_pattern`

  This column is used for debugging and diagnostics. If the
  column exists when the rules table is loaded into memory,
  the plugin updates it with the normalized form of the
  pattern. This column may be useful if you are trying to
  determine why some statement fails to be rewritten.

##### 7.6.4.3.2 Rewriter Query Rewrite Plugin Procedures and Functions

`Rewriter` plugin operation uses a stored
procedure that loads the rules table into its in-memory cache,
and a helper loadable function. Under normal operation, users
invoke only the stored procedure. The function is intended to
be invoked by the stored procedure, not directly by users.

- `flush_rewrite_rules()`

  This stored procedure uses the
  [`load_rewrite_rules()`](rewriter-query-rewrite-plugin-reference.md#function_load-rewrite-rules)
  function to load the contents of the
  `rewrite_rules` table into the
  `Rewriter` in-memory cache.

  Calling `flush_rewrite_rules()` implies
  [`COMMIT`](commit.md "15.3.1 START TRANSACTION, COMMIT, and ROLLBACK Statements").

  Invoke this procedure after you modify the rules table to
  cause the plugin to update its cache from the new table
  contents. If any errors occur, the plugin sets the
  `message` column for the appropriate rule
  rows in the table and sets the
  [`Rewriter_reload_error`](rewriter-query-rewrite-plugin-reference.md#statvar_Rewriter_reload_error)
  status variable to `ON`.
- [`load_rewrite_rules()`](rewriter-query-rewrite-plugin-reference.md#function_load-rewrite-rules)

  This function is a helper routine used by the
  `flush_rewrite_rules()` stored procedure.

##### 7.6.4.3.3 Rewriter Query Rewrite Plugin System Variables

The `Rewriter` query rewrite plugin supports
the following system variables. These variables are available
only if the plugin is installed (see
[Section 7.6.4.1, “Installing or Uninstalling the Rewriter Query Rewrite Plugin”](rewriter-query-rewrite-plugin-installation.md "7.6.4.1 Installing or Uninstalling the Rewriter Query Rewrite Plugin")).

- [`rewriter_enabled`](rewriter-query-rewrite-plugin-reference.md#sysvar_rewriter_enabled)

  |  |  |
  | --- | --- |
  | System Variable | `rewriter_enabled` |
  | Scope | Global |
  | Dynamic | Yes |
  | [`SET_VAR`](optimizer-hints.md#optimizer-hints-set-var "Variable-Setting Hint Syntax") Hint Applies | No |
  | Type | Boolean |
  | Default Value | `ON` |
  | Valid Values | `OFF` |

  Whether the `Rewriter` query rewrite
  plugin is enabled.
- [`rewriter_enabled_for_threads_without_privilege_checks`](rewriter-query-rewrite-plugin-reference.md#sysvar_rewriter_enabled_for_threads_without_privilege_checks)

  |  |  |
  | --- | --- |

  Whether to apply rewrites for replication threads which
  execute with privilege checks disabled. If set to
  `OFF`, such rewrites are skipped.
  Requires the
  [`SYSTEM_VARIABLES_ADMIN`](privileges-provided.md#priv_system-variables-admin)
  privilege or [`SUPER`](privileges-provided.md#priv_super)
  privilege to set.

  This variable has no effect if
  [`rewriter_enabled`](rewriter-query-rewrite-plugin-reference.md#sysvar_rewriter_enabled) is
  `OFF`.

##### 7.6.4.3.4 Rewriter Query Rewrite Plugin Status Variables

The `Rewriter` query rewrite plugin supports
the following status variables. These variables are available
only if the plugin is installed (see
[Section 7.6.4.1, “Installing or Uninstalling the Rewriter Query Rewrite Plugin”](rewriter-query-rewrite-plugin-installation.md "7.6.4.1 Installing or Uninstalling the Rewriter Query Rewrite Plugin")).

- [`Rewriter_number_loaded_rules`](rewriter-query-rewrite-plugin-reference.md#statvar_Rewriter_number_loaded_rules)

  The number of rewrite plugin rewrite rules successfully
  loaded from the `rewrite_rules` table
  into memory for use by the `Rewriter`
  plugin.
- [`Rewriter_number_reloads`](rewriter-query-rewrite-plugin-reference.md#statvar_Rewriter_number_reloads)

  The number of times the `rewrite_rules`
  table has been loaded into the in-memory cache used by the
  `Rewriter` plugin.
- [`Rewriter_number_rewritten_queries`](rewriter-query-rewrite-plugin-reference.md#statvar_Rewriter_number_rewritten_queries)

  The number of queries rewritten by the
  `Rewriter` query rewrite plugin since it
  was loaded.
- [`Rewriter_reload_error`](rewriter-query-rewrite-plugin-reference.md#statvar_Rewriter_reload_error)

  Whether an error occurred the most recent time that the
  `rewrite_rules` table was loaded into the
  in-memory cache used by the `Rewriter`
  plugin. If the value is `OFF`, no error
  occurred. If the value is `ON`, an error
  occurred; check the `message` column of
  the `rewriter_rules` table for error
  messages.
