#### 13.4.2.1 The Geometry Class Hierarchy

The geometry classes define a hierarchy as follows:

- `Geometry` (noninstantiable)

  - `Point` (instantiable)
  - `Curve` (noninstantiable)

    - `LineString` (instantiable)

      - `Line`
      - `LinearRing`
  - `Surface` (noninstantiable)

    - `Polygon` (instantiable)
  - `GeometryCollection` (instantiable)

    - `MultiPoint` (instantiable)
    - `MultiCurve` (noninstantiable)

      - `MultiLineString`
        (instantiable)
    - `MultiSurface` (noninstantiable)

      - `MultiPolygon` (instantiable)

It is not possible to create objects in noninstantiable
classes. It is possible to create objects in instantiable
classes. All classes have properties, and instantiable classes
may also have assertions (rules that define valid class
instances).

`Geometry` is the base class. It is an
abstract class. The instantiable subclasses of
`Geometry` are restricted to zero-, one-, and
two-dimensional geometric objects that exist in
two-dimensional coordinate space. All instantiable geometry
classes are defined so that valid instances of a geometry
class are topologically closed (that is, all defined
geometries include their boundary).

The base `Geometry` class has subclasses for
`Point`, `Curve`,
`Surface`, and
`GeometryCollection`:

- `Point` represents zero-dimensional
  objects.
- `Curve` represents one-dimensional
  objects, and has subclass `LineString`,
  with sub-subclasses `Line` and
  `LinearRing`.
- `Surface` is designed for two-dimensional
  objects and has subclass `Polygon`.
- `GeometryCollection` has specialized
  zero-, one-, and two-dimensional collection classes named
  `MultiPoint`,
  `MultiLineString`, and
  `MultiPolygon` for modeling geometries
  corresponding to collections of `Points`,
  `LineStrings`, and
  `Polygons`, respectively.
  `MultiCurve` and
  `MultiSurface` are introduced as abstract
  superclasses that generalize the collection interfaces to
  handle `Curves` and
  `Surfaces`.

`Geometry`, `Curve`,
`Surface`, `MultiCurve`, and
`MultiSurface` are defined as noninstantiable
classes. They define a common set of methods for their
subclasses and are included for extensibility.

`Point`, `LineString`,
`Polygon`,
`GeometryCollection`,
`MultiPoint`,
`MultiLineString`, and
`MultiPolygon` are instantiable classes.
