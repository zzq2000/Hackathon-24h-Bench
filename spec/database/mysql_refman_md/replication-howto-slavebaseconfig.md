#### 19.1.2.2 Setting the Replica Configuration

Each replica must have a unique server ID, as specified by the
[`server_id`](replication-options.md#sysvar_server_id) system variable. If
you are setting up multiple replicas, each one must have a
unique [`server_id`](replication-options.md#sysvar_server_id) value that
differs from that of the source and from any of the other
replicas. If the replica's server ID is not already set, or the
current value conflicts with the value that you have chosen for
the source or another replica, you must change it.

The default [`server_id`](replication-options.md#sysvar_server_id) value is
1. You can change the [`server_id`](replication-options.md#sysvar_server_id)
value dynamically by issuing a statement like this:

```sql
SET GLOBAL server_id = 21;
```

Note that a value of 0 for the server ID prevents a replica from
connecting to a source. If that server ID value (which was the
default in earlier releases) was set previously, you must
restart the server to initialize the replica with your new
nonzero server ID. Otherwise, a server restart is not needed
when you change the server ID, unless you make other
configuration changes that require it. For example, if binary
logging was disabled on the server and you want it enabled for
your replica, a server restart is required to enable this.

If you are shutting down the replica server, you can edit the
`[mysqld]` section of the configuration file to
specify a unique server ID. For example:

```ini
[mysqld]
server-id=21
```

Binary logging is enabled by default on all servers. A replica
is not required to have binary logging enabled for replication
to take place. However, binary logging on a replica means that
the replica's binary log can be used for data backups and crash
recovery. Replicas that have binary logging enabled can also be
used as part of a more complex replication topology. For
example, you might want to set up replication servers using this
chained arrangement:

```none
A -> B -> C
```

Here, `A` serves as the source for the replica
`B`, and `B` serves as the
source for the replica `C`. For this to work,
`B` must be both a source
*and* a replica. Updates received from
`A` must be logged by `B` to
its binary log, in order to be passed on to
`C`. In addition to binary logging, this
replication topology requires the system variable
[`log_replica_updates`](replication-options-binary-log.md#sysvar_log_replica_updates) (from MySQL
8.0.26) or [`log_slave_updates`](replication-options-binary-log.md#sysvar_log_slave_updates)
(before MySQL 8.0.26) to be enabled. With replica updates
enabled, the replica writes updates that are received from a
source and performed by the replica's SQL thread to the
replica's own binary log. The
[`log_replica_updates`](replication-options-binary-log.md#sysvar_log_replica_updates) or
[`log_slave_updates`](replication-options-binary-log.md#sysvar_log_slave_updates) system
variable is enabled by default.

If you need to disable binary logging or replica update logging
on a replica, you can do this by specifying the
[`--skip-log-bin`](replication-options-binary-log.md#option_mysqld_log-bin)
and [`--log-replica-updates=OFF`](replication-options-binary-log.md#sysvar_log_replica_updates) or
[`--log-slave-updates=OFF`](replication-options-binary-log.md#sysvar_log_slave_updates) options
for the replica. If you decide to re-enable these features on
the replica, remove the relevant options and restart the server.
