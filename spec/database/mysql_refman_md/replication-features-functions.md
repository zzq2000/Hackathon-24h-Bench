#### 19.5.1.14 Replication and System Functions

Certain functions do not replicate well under some conditions:

- The [`USER()`](information-functions.md#function_user),
  [`CURRENT_USER()`](information-functions.md#function_current-user) (or
  [`CURRENT_USER`](information-functions.md#function_current-user)),
  [`UUID()`](miscellaneous-functions.md#function_uuid),
  [`VERSION()`](information-functions.md#function_version), and
  [`LOAD_FILE()`](string-functions.md#function_load-file) functions are
  replicated without change and thus do not work reliably on
  the replica unless row-based replication is enabled. (See
  [Section 19.2.1, “Replication Formats”](replication-formats.md "19.2.1 Replication Formats").)

  [`USER()`](information-functions.md#function_user) and
  [`CURRENT_USER()`](information-functions.md#function_current-user) are
  automatically replicated using row-based replication when
  using `MIXED` mode, and generate a warning
  in `STATEMENT` mode. (See also
  [Section 19.5.1.8, “Replication of CURRENT\_USER()”](replication-features-current-user.md "19.5.1.8 Replication of CURRENT_USER()").) This
  is also true for [`VERSION()`](information-functions.md#function_version)
  and [`RAND()`](mathematical-functions.md#function_rand).
- For [`NOW()`](date-and-time-functions.md#function_now), the binary log
  includes the timestamp. This means that the value
  *as returned by the call to this function on the
  source* is replicated to the replica. To avoid
  unexpected results when replicating between MySQL servers in
  different time zones, set the time zone on both source and
  replica. For more information, see
  [Section 19.5.1.33, “Replication and Time Zones”](replication-features-timezone.md "19.5.1.33 Replication and Time Zones").

  To explain the potential problems when replicating between
  servers which are in different time zones, suppose that the
  source is located in New York, the replica is located in
  Stockholm, and both servers are using local time. Suppose
  further that, on the source, you create a table
  `mytable`, perform an
  [`INSERT`](insert.md "15.2.7 INSERT Statement") statement on this
  table, and then select from the table, as shown here:

  ```sql
  mysql> CREATE TABLE mytable (mycol TEXT);
  Query OK, 0 rows affected (0.06 sec)

  mysql> INSERT INTO mytable VALUES ( NOW() );
  Query OK, 1 row affected (0.00 sec)

  mysql> SELECT * FROM mytable;
  +---------------------+
  | mycol               |
  +---------------------+
  | 2009-09-01 12:00:00 |
  +---------------------+
  1 row in set (0.00 sec)
  ```

  Local time in Stockholm is 6 hours later than in New York;
  so, if you issue `SELECT NOW()` on the
  replica at that exact same instant, the value
  `2009-09-01 18:00:00` is returned. For this
  reason, if you select from the replica's copy of
  `mytable` after the
  [`CREATE TABLE`](create-table.md "15.1.20 CREATE TABLE Statement") and
  [`INSERT`](insert.md "15.2.7 INSERT Statement") statements just shown
  have been replicated, you might expect
  `mycol` to contain the value
  `2009-09-01 18:00:00`. However, this is not
  the case; when you select from the replica's copy of
  `mytable`, you obtain exactly the same
  result as on the source:

  ```sql
  mysql> SELECT * FROM mytable;
  +---------------------+
  | mycol               |
  +---------------------+
  | 2009-09-01 12:00:00 |
  +---------------------+
  1 row in set (0.00 sec)
  ```

  Unlike [`NOW()`](date-and-time-functions.md#function_now), the
  [`SYSDATE()`](date-and-time-functions.md#function_sysdate) function is not
  replication-safe because it is not affected by `SET
  TIMESTAMP` statements in the binary log and is
  nondeterministic if statement-based logging is used. This is
  not a problem if row-based logging is used.

  An alternative is to use the
  [`--sysdate-is-now`](server-options.md#option_mysqld_sysdate-is-now) option to
  cause [`SYSDATE()`](date-and-time-functions.md#function_sysdate) to be an
  alias for [`NOW()`](date-and-time-functions.md#function_now). This must be
  done on the source and the replica to work correctly. In
  such cases, a warning is still issued by this function, but
  can safely be ignored as long as
  [`--sysdate-is-now`](server-options.md#option_mysqld_sysdate-is-now) is used on
  both the source and the replica.

  [`SYSDATE()`](date-and-time-functions.md#function_sysdate) is automatically
  replicated using row-based replication when using
  `MIXED` mode, and generates a warning in
  `STATEMENT` mode.

  See also [Section 19.5.1.33, “Replication and Time Zones”](replication-features-timezone.md "19.5.1.33 Replication and Time Zones").
- *The following restriction applies to
  statement-based replication only, not to row-based
  replication.* The
  [`GET_LOCK()`](locking-functions.md#function_get-lock),
  [`RELEASE_LOCK()`](locking-functions.md#function_release-lock),
  [`IS_FREE_LOCK()`](locking-functions.md#function_is-free-lock), and
  [`IS_USED_LOCK()`](locking-functions.md#function_is-used-lock) functions that
  handle user-level locks are replicated without the replica
  knowing the concurrency context on the source. Therefore,
  these functions should not be used to insert into a source
  table because the content on the replica would differ. For
  example, do not issue a statement such as `INSERT
  INTO mytable VALUES(GET_LOCK(...))`.

  These functions are automatically replicated using row-based
  replication when using `MIXED` mode, and
  generate a warning in `STATEMENT` mode.

As a workaround for the preceding limitations when
statement-based replication is in effect, you can use the
strategy of saving the problematic function result in a user
variable and referring to the variable in a later statement. For
example, the following single-row
[`INSERT`](insert.md "15.2.7 INSERT Statement") is problematic due to the
reference to the [`UUID()`](miscellaneous-functions.md#function_uuid) function:

```sql
INSERT INTO t VALUES(UUID());
```

To work around the problem, do this instead:

```sql
SET @my_uuid = UUID();
INSERT INTO t VALUES(@my_uuid);
```

That sequence of statements replicates because the value of
`@my_uuid` is stored in the binary log as a
user-variable event prior to the
[`INSERT`](insert.md "15.2.7 INSERT Statement") statement and is available
for use in the [`INSERT`](insert.md "15.2.7 INSERT Statement").

The same idea applies to multiple-row inserts, but is more
cumbersome to use. For a two-row insert, you can do this:

```sql
SET @my_uuid1 = UUID(); @my_uuid2 = UUID();
INSERT INTO t VALUES(@my_uuid1),(@my_uuid2);
```

However, if the number of rows is large or unknown, the
workaround is difficult or impracticable. For example, you
cannot convert the following statement to one in which a given
individual user variable is associated with each row:

```sql
INSERT INTO t2 SELECT UUID(), * FROM t1;
```

Within a stored function, [`RAND()`](mathematical-functions.md#function_rand)
replicates correctly as long as it is invoked only once during
the execution of the function. (You can consider the function
execution timestamp and random number seed as implicit inputs
that are identical on the source and replica.)

The [`FOUND_ROWS()`](information-functions.md#function_found-rows) and
[`ROW_COUNT()`](information-functions.md#function_row-count) functions are not
replicated reliably using statement-based replication. A
workaround is to store the result of the function call in a user
variable, and then use that in the
[`INSERT`](insert.md "15.2.7 INSERT Statement") statement. For example, if
you wish to store the result in a table named
`mytable`, you might normally do so like this:

```sql
SELECT SQL_CALC_FOUND_ROWS FROM mytable LIMIT 1;
INSERT INTO mytable VALUES( FOUND_ROWS() );
```

However, if you are replicating `mytable`, you
should use [`SELECT
... INTO`](select-into.md "15.2.13.1 SELECT ... INTO Statement"), and then store the variable in the table,
like this:

```sql
SELECT SQL_CALC_FOUND_ROWS INTO @found_rows FROM mytable LIMIT 1;
INSERT INTO mytable VALUES(@found_rows);
```

In this way, the user variable is replicated as part of the
context, and applied on the replica correctly.

These functions are automatically replicated using row-based
replication when using `MIXED` mode, and
generate a warning in `STATEMENT` mode. (Bug
