#### 22.3.3.5 Remove Documents

You can use the `remove()` method to delete
some or all documents from a collection in a schema. The
X DevAPI provides additional methods for use with the
`remove()` method to filter and sort the
documents to be removed.

##### Remove Documents Using Conditions

The following example passes a search condition to the
`remove()` method. All documents matching the
condition are removed from the `countryinfo`
collection. In this example, one document matches the
condition.

```mysqlsh
mysql-js> db.countryinfo.remove("Code = 'SEA'")
```

##### Remove the First Document

To remove the first document in the
`countryinfo` collection, use the
`limit()` method with a value of 1.

```mysqlsh
mysql-js> db.countryinfo.remove("true").limit(1)
```

##### Remove the Last Document in an Order

The following example removes the last document in the
`countryinfo` collection by country name.

```mysqlsh
mysql-js> db.countryinfo.remove("true").sort(["Name desc"]).limit(1)
```

##### Remove All Documents in a Collection

You can remove all documents in a collection. To do so, use
the `remove("true")` method without
specifying a search condition.

Caution

Use care when you remove documents without specifying a
search condition. This action deletes all documents from the
collection.

Alternatively, use the
`db.drop_collection('countryinfo')` operation
to delete the `countryinfo` collection.
