## 16.7 Data Dictionary Usage Differences

Use of a data dictionary-enabled MySQL server entails some
operational differences compared to a server that does not have a
data dictionary:

- Previously, enabling the
  [`innodb_read_only`](innodb-parameters.md#sysvar_innodb_read_only) system
  variable prevented creating and dropping tables only for the
  `InnoDB` storage engine. As of MySQL
  8.0, enabling
  [`innodb_read_only`](innodb-parameters.md#sysvar_innodb_read_only) prevents
  these operations for all storage engines. Table creation and
  drop operations for any storage engine modify data dictionary
  tables in the `mysql` system database, but
  those tables use the `InnoDB` storage engine
  and cannot be modified when
  [`innodb_read_only`](innodb-parameters.md#sysvar_innodb_read_only) is enabled.
  The same principle applies to other table operations that
  require modifying data dictionary tables. Examples:

  - [`ANALYZE TABLE`](analyze-table.md "15.7.3.1 ANALYZE TABLE Statement") fails because
    it updates table statistics, which are stored in the data
    dictionary.
  - [`ALTER TABLE
    tbl_name
    ENGINE=engine_name`](alter-table.md "15.1.9 ALTER TABLE Statement")
    fails because it updates the storage engine designation,
    which is stored in the data dictionary.

  Note

  Enabling [`innodb_read_only`](innodb-parameters.md#sysvar_innodb_read_only)
  also has important implications for non-data dictionary
  tables in the `mysql` system database. For
  details, see the description of
  [`innodb_read_only`](innodb-parameters.md#sysvar_innodb_read_only) in
  [Section 17.14, “InnoDB Startup Options and System Variables”](innodb-parameters.md "17.14 InnoDB Startup Options and System Variables")
- Previously, tables in the `mysql` system
  database were visible to DML and DDL statements. As of MySQL
  8.0, data dictionary tables are invisible and
  cannot be modified or queried directly. However, in most cases
  there are corresponding `INFORMATION_SCHEMA`
  tables that can be queried instead. This enables the
  underlying data dictionary tables to be changed as server
  development proceeds, while maintaining a stable
  `INFORMATION_SCHEMA` interface for
  application use.
- `INFORMATION_SCHEMA` tables in MySQL
  8.0 are closely tied to the data dictionary,
  resulting in several usage differences:

  - Previously, `INFORMATION_SCHEMA` queries
    for table statistics in the
    [`STATISTICS`](information-schema-statistics-table.md "28.3.34 The INFORMATION_SCHEMA STATISTICS Table") and
    [`TABLES`](information-schema-tables-table.md "28.3.38 The INFORMATION_SCHEMA TABLES Table") tables retrieved
    statistics directly from storage engines. As of MySQL
    8.0, cached table statistics are used by
    default. The
    [`information_schema_stats_expiry`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_information_schema_stats_expiry)
    system variable defines the period of time before cached
    table statistics expire. The default is 86400 seconds (24
    hours). (To update the cached values at any time for a
    given table, use [`ANALYZE
    TABLE`](analyze-table.md "15.7.3.1 ANALYZE TABLE Statement").) If there are no cached statistics or
    statistics have expired, statistics are retrieved from
    storage engines when querying table statistics columns. To
    always retrieve the latest statistics directly from
    storage engines, set
    [`information_schema_stats_expiry`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_information_schema_stats_expiry)
    to `0`. For more information, see
    [Section 10.2.3, “Optimizing INFORMATION\_SCHEMA Queries”](information-schema-optimization.md "10.2.3 Optimizing INFORMATION_SCHEMA Queries").
  - Several `INFORMATION_SCHEMA` tables are
    views on data dictionary tables, which enables the
    optimizer to use indexes on those underlying tables.
    Consequently, depending on optimizer choices, the row
    order of results for `INFORMATION_SCHEMA`
    queries might differ from previous results. If a query
    result must have specific row ordering characteristics,
    include an `ORDER BY` clause.
  - Queries on `INFORMATION_SCHEMA` tables
    may return column names in a different lettercase than in
    earlier MySQL series. Applications should test result set
    column names in case-insensitive fashion. If that is not
    feasible, a workaround is to use column aliases in the
    select list that return column names in the required
    lettercase. For example:

    ```sql
    SELECT TABLE_SCHEMA AS table_schema, TABLE_NAME AS table_name
    FROM INFORMATION_SCHEMA.TABLES WHERE TABLE_NAME = 'users';
    ```
  - [**mysqldump**](mysqldump.md "6.5.4 mysqldump — A Database Backup Program") and
    [**mysqlpump**](mysqlpump.md "6.5.6 mysqlpump — A Database Backup Program") no longer dump the
    `INFORMATION_SCHEMA` database, even if
    explicitly named on the command line.
  - [`CREATE
    TABLE dst_tbl LIKE
    src_tbl`](create-table-like.md "15.1.20.3 CREATE TABLE ... LIKE Statement") requires that
    *`src_tbl`* be a base table and
    fails if it is an `INFORMATION_SCHEMA`
    table that is a view on data dictionary tables.
  - Previously, result set headers of columns selected from
    `INFORMATION_SCHEMA` tables used the
    capitalization specified in the query. This query produces
    a result set with a header of
    `table_name`:

    ```sql
    SELECT table_name FROM INFORMATION_SCHEMA.TABLES;
    ```

    As of MySQL 8.0, these headers are
    capitalized; the preceding query produces a result set
    with a header of `TABLE_NAME`. If
    necessary, a column alias can be used to achieve a
    different lettercase. For example:

    ```sql
    SELECT table_name AS 'table_name' FROM INFORMATION_SCHEMA.TABLES;
    ```
- The data directory affects how [**mysqldump**](mysqldump.md "6.5.4 mysqldump — A Database Backup Program")
  and [**mysqlpump**](mysqlpump.md "6.5.6 mysqlpump — A Database Backup Program") dump information from the
  `mysql` system database:

  - Previously, it was possible to dump all tables in the
    `mysql` system database. As of MySQL
    8.0, [**mysqldump**](mysqldump.md "6.5.4 mysqldump — A Database Backup Program") and
    [**mysqlpump**](mysqlpump.md "6.5.6 mysqlpump — A Database Backup Program") dump only non-data dictionary
    tables in that database.
  - Previously, the
    [`--routines`](mysqldump.md#option_mysqldump_routines) and
    [`--events`](mysqldump.md#option_mysqldump_events) options were
    not required to include stored routines and events when
    using the
    [`--all-databases`](mysqldump.md#option_mysqldump_all-databases) option:
    The dump included the `mysql` system
    database, and therefore also the `proc`
    and `event` tables containing stored
    routine and event definitions. As of MySQL
    8.0, the `event` and
    `proc` tables are not used. Definitions
    for the corresponding objects are stored in data
    dictionary tables, but those tables are not dumped. To
    include stored routines and events in a dump made using
    [`--all-databases`](mysqldump.md#option_mysqldump_all-databases), use the
    [`--routines`](mysqldump.md#option_mysqldump_routines) and
    [`--events`](mysqldump.md#option_mysqldump_events) options
    explicitly.
  - Previously, the
    [`--routines`](mysqldump.md#option_mysqldump_routines) option
    required the [`SELECT`](privileges-provided.md#priv_select)
    privilege for the `proc` table. As of
    MySQL 8.0, that table is not used;
    [`--routines`](mysqldump.md#option_mysqldump_routines) requires the
    global [`SELECT`](privileges-provided.md#priv_select) privilege
    instead.
  - Previously, it was possible to dump stored routine and
    event definitions together with their creation and
    modification timestamps, by dumping the
    `proc` and `event`
    tables. As of MySQL 8.0, those tables are not
    used, so it is not possible to dump timestamps.
- Previously, creating a stored routine that contains illegal
  characters produced a warning. As of MySQL 8.0,
  this is an error.
