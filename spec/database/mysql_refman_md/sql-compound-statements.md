This section describes the syntax for the
[`BEGIN ... END`](begin-end.md "15.6.1 BEGIN ... END Compound Statement")
compound statement and other statements that can be used in the body
of stored programs: Stored procedures and functions, triggers, and
events. These objects are defined in terms of SQL code that is
stored on the server for later invocation (see
[Chapter 27, *Stored Objects*](stored-objects.md "Chapter 27 Stored Objects")).

A compound statement is a block that can contain other blocks;
declarations for variables, condition handlers, and cursors; and
flow control constructs such as loops and conditional tests.
