### 12.2.1 Character Set Repertoire

The repertoire of a
character set is the collection of characters in the set.

String expressions have a repertoire attribute, which can have
two values:

- `ASCII`: The expression can contain only
  ASCII characters; that is, characters in the Unicode range
  `U+0000` to `U+007F`.
- `UNICODE`: The expression can contain
  characters in the Unicode range `U+0000` to
  `U+10FFFF`. This includes characters in the
  Basic Multilingual Plane (BMP) range
  (`U+0000` to `U+FFFF`) and
  supplementary characters outside the BMP range
  (`U+10000` to `U+10FFFF`).

The `ASCII` range is a subset of
`UNICODE` range, so a string with
`ASCII` repertoire can be converted safely
without loss of information to the character set of any string
with `UNICODE` repertoire. It can also be
converted safely to any character set that is a superset of the
`ascii` character set. (All MySQL character
sets are supersets of `ascii` with the
exception of `swe7`, which reuses some
punctuation characters for Swedish accented characters.)

The use of repertoire enables character set conversion in
expressions for many cases where MySQL would otherwise return an
“illegal mix of collations” error when the rules
for collation coercibility are insufficient to resolve
ambiguities. (For information about coercibility, see
[Section 12.8.4, “Collation Coercibility in Expressions”](charset-collation-coercibility.md "12.8.4 Collation Coercibility in Expressions").)

The following discussion provides examples of expressions and
their repertoires, and describes how the use of repertoire
changes string expression evaluation:

- The repertoire for a string constant depends on string
  content and may differ from the repertoire of the string
  character set. Consider these statements:

  ```sql
  SET NAMES utf8mb4; SELECT 'abc';
  SELECT _utf8mb4'def';
  ```

  Although the character set is `utf8mb4` in
  each of the preceding cases, the strings do not actually
  contain any characters outside the ASCII range, so their
  repertoire is `ASCII` rather than
  `UNICODE`.
- A column having the `ascii` character set
  has `ASCII` repertoire because of its
  character set. In the following table, `c1`
  has `ASCII` repertoire:

  ```sql
  CREATE TABLE t1 (c1 CHAR(1) CHARACTER SET ascii);
  ```

  The following example illustrates how repertoire enables a
  result to be determined in a case where an error occurs
  without repertoire:

  ```sql
  CREATE TABLE t1 (
    c1 CHAR(1) CHARACTER SET latin1,
    c2 CHAR(1) CHARACTER SET ascii
  );
  INSERT INTO t1 VALUES ('a','b');
  SELECT CONCAT(c1,c2) FROM t1;
  ```

  Without repertoire, this error occurs:

  ```none
  ERROR 1267 (HY000): Illegal mix of collations (latin1_swedish_ci,IMPLICIT)
  and (ascii_general_ci,IMPLICIT) for operation 'concat'
  ```

  Using repertoire, subset to superset
  (`ascii` to `latin1`)
  conversion can occur and a result is returned:

  ```simple
  +---------------+
  | CONCAT(c1,c2) |
  +---------------+
  | ab            |
  +---------------+
  ```
- Functions with one string argument inherit the repertoire of
  their argument. The result of
  [`UPPER(_utf8mb4'abc')`](string-functions.md#function_upper) has
  `ASCII` repertoire because its argument has
  `ASCII` repertoire. (Despite the
  `_utf8mb4` introducer, the string
  `'abc'` contains no characters outside the
  ASCII range.)
- For functions that return a string but do not have string
  arguments and use
  [`character_set_connection`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_character_set_connection) as
  the result character set, the result repertoire is
  `ASCII` if
  [`character_set_connection`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_character_set_connection) is
  `ascii`, and `UNICODE`
  otherwise:

  ```sql
  FORMAT(numeric_column, 4);
  ```

  Use of repertoire changes how MySQL evaluates the following
  example:

  ```sql
  SET NAMES ascii;
  CREATE TABLE t1 (a INT, b VARCHAR(10) CHARACTER SET latin1);
  INSERT INTO t1 VALUES (1,'b');
  SELECT CONCAT(FORMAT(a, 4), b) FROM t1;
  ```

  Without repertoire, this error occurs:

  ```none
  ERROR 1267 (HY000): Illegal mix of collations (ascii_general_ci,COERCIBLE)
  and (latin1_swedish_ci,IMPLICIT) for operation 'concat'
  ```

  With repertoire, a result is returned:

  ```sql
  +-------------------------+
  | CONCAT(FORMAT(a, 4), b) |
  +-------------------------+
  | 1.0000b                 |
  +-------------------------+
  ```
- Functions with two or more string arguments use the
  “widest” argument repertoire for the result
  repertoire, where `UNICODE` is wider than
  `ASCII`. Consider the following
  [`CONCAT()`](string-functions.md#function_concat) calls:

  ```sql
  CONCAT(_ucs2 X'0041', _ucs2 X'0042')
  CONCAT(_ucs2 X'0041', _ucs2 X'00C2')
  ```

  For the first call, the repertoire is
  `ASCII` because both arguments are within
  the ASCII range. For the second call, the repertoire is
  `UNICODE` because the second argument is
  outside the ASCII range.
- The repertoire for function return values is determined
  based on the repertoire of only those arguments that affect
  the result's character set and collation.

  ```sql
  IF(column1 < column2, 'smaller', 'greater')
  ```

  The result repertoire is `ASCII` because
  the two string arguments (the second argument and the third
  argument) both have `ASCII` repertoire. The
  first argument does not matter for the result repertoire,
  even if the expression uses string values.
