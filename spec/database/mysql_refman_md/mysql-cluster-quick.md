### 25.4.1 Quick Test Setup of NDB Cluster

To familiarize you with the basics, we describe the simplest
possible configuration for a functional NDB Cluster. After this,
you should be able to design your desired setup from the
information provided in the other relevant sections of this
chapter.

First, you need to create a configuration directory such as
`/var/lib/mysql-cluster`, by executing the
following command as the system `root` user:

```terminal
$> mkdir /var/lib/mysql-cluster
```

In this directory, create a file named
`config.ini` that contains the following
information. Substitute appropriate values for
`HostName` and `DataDir` as
necessary for your system.

```ini
# file "config.ini" - showing minimal setup consisting of 1 data node,
# 1 management server, and 3 MySQL servers.
# The empty default sections are not required, and are shown only for
# the sake of completeness.
# Data nodes must provide a hostname but MySQL Servers are not required
# to do so.
# If you do not know the hostname for your machine, use localhost.
# The DataDir parameter also has a default value, but it is recommended to
# set it explicitly.
# [api] and [mgm] are aliases for [mysqld] and [ndb_mgmd], respectively.

[ndbd default]
NoOfReplicas= 1

[mysqld  default]
[ndb_mgmd default]
[tcp default]

[ndb_mgmd]
HostName= myhost.example.com

[ndbd]
HostName= myhost.example.com
DataDir= /var/lib/mysql-cluster

[mysqld]
[mysqld]
[mysqld]
```

You can now start the [**ndb\_mgmd**](mysql-cluster-programs-ndb-mgmd.md "25.5.4 ndb_mgmd — The NDB Cluster Management Server Daemon") management
server. By default, it attempts to read the
`config.ini` file in its current working
directory, so change location into the directory where the file is
located and then invoke [**ndb\_mgmd**](mysql-cluster-programs-ndb-mgmd.md "25.5.4 ndb_mgmd — The NDB Cluster Management Server Daemon"):

```terminal
$> cd /var/lib/mysql-cluster
$> ndb_mgmd
```

Then start a single data node by running [**ndbd**](mysql-cluster-programs-ndbd.md "25.5.1 ndbd — The NDB Cluster Data Node Daemon"):

```terminal
$> ndbd
```

By default, [**ndbd**](mysql-cluster-programs-ndbd.md "25.5.1 ndbd — The NDB Cluster Data Node Daemon") looks for the management
server at `localhost` on port 1186.

Note

If you have installed MySQL from a binary tarball, you must to
specify the path of the [**ndb\_mgmd**](mysql-cluster-programs-ndb-mgmd.md "25.5.4 ndb_mgmd — The NDB Cluster Management Server Daemon") and
[**ndbd**](mysql-cluster-programs-ndbd.md "25.5.1 ndbd — The NDB Cluster Data Node Daemon") servers explicitly. (Normally, these can
be found in `/usr/local/mysql/bin`.)

Finally, change location to the MySQL data directory (usually
`/var/lib/mysql` or
`/usr/local/mysql/data`), and make sure that
the `my.cnf` file contains the option necessary
to enable the NDB storage engine:

```ini
[mysqld]
ndbcluster
```

You can now start the MySQL server as usual:

```terminal
$> mysqld_safe --user=mysql &
```

Wait a moment to make sure the MySQL server is running properly.
If you see the notice `mysql ended`, check the
server's `.err` file to find out what went
wrong.

If all has gone well so far, you now can start using the cluster.
Connect to the server and verify that the
[`NDBCLUSTER`](mysql-cluster.md "Chapter 25 MySQL NDB Cluster 8.0") storage engine is enabled:

```sql
$> mysql
Welcome to the MySQL monitor.  Commands end with ; or \g.
Your MySQL connection id is 1 to server version: 8.0.45

Type 'help;' or '\h' for help. Type '\c' to clear the buffer.

mysql> SHOW ENGINES\G
...
*************************** 12. row ***************************
Engine: NDBCLUSTER
Support: YES
Comment: Clustered, fault-tolerant, memory-based tables
*************************** 13. row ***************************
Engine: NDB
Support: YES
Comment: Alias for NDBCLUSTER
...
```

The row numbers shown in the preceding example output may be
different from those shown on your system, depending upon how your
server is configured.

Try to create an [`NDBCLUSTER`](mysql-cluster.md "Chapter 25 MySQL NDB Cluster 8.0") table:

```sql
$> mysql
mysql> USE test;
Database changed

mysql> CREATE TABLE ctest (i INT) ENGINE=NDBCLUSTER;
Query OK, 0 rows affected (0.09 sec)

mysql> SHOW CREATE TABLE ctest \G
*************************** 1. row ***************************
       Table: ctest
Create Table: CREATE TABLE `ctest` (
  `i` int(11) default NULL
) ENGINE=ndbcluster DEFAULT CHARSET=utf8mb4 COLLATE=utf8mb4_0900_ai_ci
1 row in set (0.00 sec)
```

To check that your nodes were set up properly, start the
management client:

```terminal
$> ndb_mgm
```

Use the **SHOW** command from within the management
client to obtain a report on the cluster's status:

```ndbmgm
ndb_mgm> SHOW
Cluster Configuration
---------------------
[ndbd(NDB)]     1 node(s)
id=2    @127.0.0.1  (Version: 8.0.44-ndb-8.0.44, Nodegroup: 0, *)

[ndb_mgmd(MGM)] 1 node(s)
id=1    @127.0.0.1  (Version: 8.0.44-ndb-8.0.44)

[mysqld(API)]   3 node(s)
id=3    @127.0.0.1  (Version: 8.0.44-ndb-8.0.44)
id=4 (not connected, accepting connect from any host)
id=5 (not connected, accepting connect from any host)
```

At this point, you have successfully set up a working NDB Cluster
. You can now store data in the cluster by using any table created
with `ENGINE=NDBCLUSTER` or its alias
`ENGINE=NDB`.
