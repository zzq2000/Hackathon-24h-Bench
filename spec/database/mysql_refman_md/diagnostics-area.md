#### 15.6.7.7 The MySQL Diagnostics Area

SQL statements produce diagnostic information that populates the
diagnostics area. Standard SQL has a diagnostics area stack,
containing a diagnostics area for each nested execution context.
Standard SQL also supports
[`GET STACKED
DIAGNOSTICS`](get-diagnostics.md "15.6.7.3 GET DIAGNOSTICS Statement") syntax for referring to the second
diagnostics area during condition handler execution.

The following discussion describes the structure of the
diagnostics area in MySQL, the information items recognized by
MySQL, how statements clear and set the diagnostics area, and
how diagnostics areas are pushed to and popped from the stack.

##### Diagnostics Area Structure

The diagnostics area contains two kinds of information:

- Statement information, such as the number of conditions
  that occurred or the affected-rows count.
- Condition information, such as the error code and message.
  If a statement raises multiple conditions, this part of
  the diagnostics area has a condition area for each one. If
  a statement raises no conditions, this part of the
  diagnostics area is empty.

For a statement that produces three conditions, the
diagnostics area contains statement and condition information
like this:

```none
Statement information:
  row count
  ... other statement information items ...
Condition area list:
  Condition area 1:
    error code for condition 1
    error message for condition 1
    ... other condition information items ...
  Condition area 2:
    error code for condition 2:
    error message for condition 2
    ... other condition information items ...
  Condition area 3:
    error code for condition 3
    error message for condition 3
    ... other condition information items ...
```

##### Diagnostics Area Information Items

The diagnostics area contains statement and condition
information items. Numeric items are integers. The character
set for character items is UTF-8. No item can be
`NULL`. If a statement or condition item is
not set by a statement that populates the diagnostics area,
its value is 0 or the empty string, depending on the item data
type.

The statement information part of the diagnostics area
contains these items:

- `NUMBER`: An integer indicating the
  number of condition areas that have information.
- `ROW_COUNT`: An integer indicating the
  number of rows affected by the statement.
  `ROW_COUNT` has the same value as the
  [`ROW_COUNT()`](information-functions.md#function_row-count) function (see
  [Section 14.15, “Information Functions”](information-functions.md "14.15 Information Functions")).

The condition information part of the diagnostics area
contains a condition area for each condition. Condition areas
are numbered from 1 to the value of the
`NUMBER` statement condition item. If
`NUMBER` is 0, there are no condition areas.

Each condition area contains the items in the following list.
All items are standard SQL except
`MYSQL_ERRNO`, which is a MySQL extension.
The definitions apply for conditions generated other than by a
signal (that is, by a [`SIGNAL`](signal.md "15.6.7.5 SIGNAL Statement") or
[`RESIGNAL`](resignal.md "15.6.7.4 RESIGNAL Statement") statement). For
nonsignal conditions, MySQL populates only those condition
items not described as always empty. The effects of signals on
the condition area are described later.

- `CLASS_ORIGIN`: A string containing the
  class of the `RETURNED_SQLSTATE` value.
  If the `RETURNED_SQLSTATE` value begins
  with a class value defined in SQL standards document ISO
  9075-2 (section 24.1, SQLSTATE),
  `CLASS_ORIGIN` is `'ISO
  9075'`. Otherwise,
  `CLASS_ORIGIN` is
  `'MySQL'`.
- `SUBCLASS_ORIGIN`: A string containing
  the subclass of the `RETURNED_SQLSTATE`
  value. If `CLASS_ORIGIN` is `'ISO
  9075'` or `RETURNED_SQLSTATE`
  ends with `'000'`,
  `SUBCLASS_ORIGIN` is `'ISO
  9075'`. Otherwise,
  `SUBCLASS_ORIGIN` is
  `'MySQL'`.
- `RETURNED_SQLSTATE`: A string that
  indicates the `SQLSTATE` value for the
  condition.
- `MESSAGE_TEXT`: A string that indicates
  the error message for the condition.
- `MYSQL_ERRNO`: An integer that indicates
  the MySQL error code for the condition.
- `CONSTRAINT_CATALOG`,
  `CONSTRAINT_SCHEMA`,
  `CONSTRAINT_NAME`: Strings that indicate
  the catalog, schema, and name for a violated constraint.
  They are always empty.
- `CATALOG_NAME`,
  `SCHEMA_NAME`,
  `TABLE_NAME`,
  `COLUMN_NAME`: Strings that indicate the
  catalog, schema, table, and column related to the
  condition. They are always empty.
- `CURSOR_NAME`: A string that indicates
  the cursor name. This is always empty.

For the `RETURNED_SQLSTATE`,
`MESSAGE_TEXT`, and
`MYSQL_ERRNO` values for particular errors,
see [Server Error Message Reference](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/mysql-errors/8.0/en/server-error-reference.html).

If a [`SIGNAL`](signal.md "15.6.7.5 SIGNAL Statement") (or
[`RESIGNAL`](resignal.md "15.6.7.4 RESIGNAL Statement")) statement populates
the diagnostics area, its `SET` clause can
assign to any condition information item except
`RETURNED_SQLSTATE` any value that is legal
for the item data type. [`SIGNAL`](signal.md "15.6.7.5 SIGNAL Statement")
also sets the `RETURNED_SQLSTATE` value, but
not directly in its `SET` clause. That value
comes from the [`SIGNAL`](signal.md "15.6.7.5 SIGNAL Statement") statement
`SQLSTATE` argument.

[`SIGNAL`](signal.md "15.6.7.5 SIGNAL Statement") also sets statement
information items. It sets `NUMBER` to 1. It
sets `ROW_COUNT` to −1 for errors and 0
otherwise.

##### How the Diagnostics Area is Cleared and Populated

Nondiagnostic SQL statements populate the diagnostics area
automatically, and its contents can be set explicitly with the
[`SIGNAL`](signal.md "15.6.7.5 SIGNAL Statement") and
[`RESIGNAL`](resignal.md "15.6.7.4 RESIGNAL Statement") statements. The
diagnostics area can be examined with [`GET
DIAGNOSTICS`](get-diagnostics.md "15.6.7.3 GET DIAGNOSTICS Statement") to extract specific items, or with
[`SHOW WARNINGS`](show-warnings.md "15.7.7.42 SHOW WARNINGS Statement") or
[`SHOW ERRORS`](show-errors.md "15.7.7.17 SHOW ERRORS Statement") to see conditions
or errors.

SQL statements clear and set the diagnostics area as follows:

- When the server starts executing a statement after parsing
  it, it clears the diagnostics area for nondiagnostic
  statements. Diagnostic statements do not clear the
  diagnostics area. These statements are diagnostic:

  - [`GET DIAGNOSTICS`](get-diagnostics.md "15.6.7.3 GET DIAGNOSTICS Statement")
  - [`SHOW ERRORS`](show-errors.md "15.7.7.17 SHOW ERRORS Statement")
  - [`SHOW WARNINGS`](show-warnings.md "15.7.7.42 SHOW WARNINGS Statement")
- If a statement raises a condition, the diagnostics area is
  cleared of conditions that belong to earlier statements.
  The exception is that conditions raised by
  [`GET DIAGNOSTICS`](get-diagnostics.md "15.6.7.3 GET DIAGNOSTICS Statement") and
  [`RESIGNAL`](resignal.md "15.6.7.4 RESIGNAL Statement") are added to the
  diagnostics area without clearing it.

Thus, even a statement that does not normally clear the
diagnostics area when it begins executing clears it if the
statement raises a condition.

The following example shows the effect of various statements
on the diagnostics area, using [`SHOW
WARNINGS`](show-warnings.md "15.7.7.42 SHOW WARNINGS Statement") to display information about conditions
stored there.

This [`DROP TABLE`](drop-table.md "15.1.32 DROP TABLE Statement") statement
clears the diagnostics area and populates it when the
condition occurs:

```sql
mysql> DROP TABLE IF EXISTS test.no_such_table;
Query OK, 0 rows affected, 1 warning (0.01 sec)

mysql> SHOW WARNINGS;
+-------+------+------------------------------------+
| Level | Code | Message                            |
+-------+------+------------------------------------+
| Note  | 1051 | Unknown table 'test.no_such_table' |
+-------+------+------------------------------------+
1 row in set (0.00 sec)
```

This
[`SET`](set-variable.md "15.7.6.1 SET Syntax for Variable Assignment")
statement generates an error, so it clears and populates the
diagnostics area:

```sql
mysql> SET @x = @@x;
ERROR 1193 (HY000): Unknown system variable 'x'

mysql> SHOW WARNINGS;
+-------+------+-----------------------------+
| Level | Code | Message                     |
+-------+------+-----------------------------+
| Error | 1193 | Unknown system variable 'x' |
+-------+------+-----------------------------+
1 row in set (0.00 sec)
```

The previous
[`SET`](set-variable.md "15.7.6.1 SET Syntax for Variable Assignment")
statement produced a single condition, so 1 is the only valid
condition number for [`GET
DIAGNOSTICS`](get-diagnostics.md "15.6.7.3 GET DIAGNOSTICS Statement") at this point. The following statement
uses a condition number of 2, which produces a warning that is
added to the diagnostics area without clearing it:

```sql
mysql> GET DIAGNOSTICS CONDITION 2 @p = MESSAGE_TEXT;
Query OK, 0 rows affected, 1 warning (0.00 sec)

mysql> SHOW WARNINGS;
+-------+------+------------------------------+
| Level | Code | Message                      |
+-------+------+------------------------------+
| Error | 1193 | Unknown system variable 'xx' |
| Error | 1753 | Invalid condition number     |
+-------+------+------------------------------+
2 rows in set (0.00 sec)
```

Now there are two conditions in the diagnostics area, so the
same [`GET DIAGNOSTICS`](get-diagnostics.md "15.6.7.3 GET DIAGNOSTICS Statement") statement
succeeds:

```sql
mysql> GET DIAGNOSTICS CONDITION 2 @p = MESSAGE_TEXT;
Query OK, 0 rows affected (0.00 sec)

mysql> SELECT @p;
+--------------------------+
| @p                       |
+--------------------------+
| Invalid condition number |
+--------------------------+
1 row in set (0.01 sec)
```

##### How the Diagnostics Area Stack Works

When a push to the diagnostics area stack occurs, the first
(current) diagnostics area becomes the second (stacked)
diagnostics area and a new current diagnostics area is created
as a copy of it. Diagnostics areas are pushed to and popped
from the stack under the following circumstances:

- Execution of a stored program

  A push occurs before the program executes and a pop occurs
  afterward. If the stored program ends while handlers are
  executing, there can be more than one diagnostics area to
  pop; this occurs due to an exception for which there are
  no appropriate handlers or due to
  [`RETURN`](return.md "15.6.5.7 RETURN Statement") in the handler.

  Any warning or error conditions in the popped diagnostics
  areas then are added to the current diagnostics area,
  except that, for triggers, only errors are added. When the
  stored program ends, the caller sees these conditions in
  its current diagnostics area.
- Execution of a condition handler within a stored program

  When a push occurs as a result of condition handler
  activation, the stacked diagnostics area is the area that
  was current within the stored program prior to the push.
  The new now-current diagnostics area is the handler's
  current diagnostics area.
  [`GET
  [CURRENT] DIAGNOSTICS`](get-diagnostics.md "15.6.7.3 GET DIAGNOSTICS Statement") and
  [`GET
  STACKED DIAGNOSTICS`](get-diagnostics.md "15.6.7.3 GET DIAGNOSTICS Statement") can be used within the
  handler to access the contents of the current (handler)
  and stacked (stored program) diagnostics areas. Initially,
  they return the same result, but statements executing
  within the handler modify the current diagnostics area,
  clearing and setting its contents according to the normal
  rules (see [How the Diagnostics Area is Cleared and Populated](diagnostics-area.md#diagnostics-area-populating "How the Diagnostics Area is Cleared and Populated")).
  The stacked diagnostics area cannot be modified by
  statements executing within the handler except
  [`RESIGNAL`](resignal.md "15.6.7.4 RESIGNAL Statement").

  If the handler executes successfully, the current
  (handler) diagnostics area is popped and the stacked
  (stored program) diagnostics area again becomes the
  current diagnostics area. Conditions added to the handler
  diagnostics area during handler execution are added to the
  current diagnostics area.
- Execution of [`RESIGNAL`](resignal.md "15.6.7.4 RESIGNAL Statement")

  The [`RESIGNAL`](resignal.md "15.6.7.4 RESIGNAL Statement") statement
  passes on the error condition information that is
  available during execution of a condition handler within a
  compound statement inside a stored program.
  [`RESIGNAL`](resignal.md "15.6.7.4 RESIGNAL Statement") may change some or
  all information before passing it on, modifying the
  diagnostics stack as described in
  [Section 15.6.7.4, “RESIGNAL Statement”](resignal.md "15.6.7.4 RESIGNAL Statement").

##### Diagnostics Area-Related System Variables

Certain system variables control or are related to some
aspects of the diagnostics area:

- [`max_error_count`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_max_error_count) controls
  the number of condition areas in the diagnostics area. If
  more conditions than this occur, MySQL silently discards
  information for the excess conditions. (Conditions added
  by [`RESIGNAL`](resignal.md "15.6.7.4 RESIGNAL Statement") are always
  added, with older conditions being discarded as necessary
  to make room.)
- [`warning_count`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_warning_count) indicates
  the number of conditions that occurred. This includes
  errors, warnings, and notes. Normally,
  `NUMBER` and
  [`warning_count`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_warning_count) are the
  same. However, as the number of conditions generated
  exceeds [`max_error_count`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_max_error_count),
  the value of
  [`warning_count`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_warning_count) continues
  to rise whereas `NUMBER` remains capped
  at [`max_error_count`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_max_error_count)
  because no additional conditions are stored in the
  diagnostics area.
- [`error_count`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_error_count) indicates the
  number of errors that occurred. This value includes
  “not found” and exception conditions, but
  excludes warnings and notes. Like
  [`warning_count`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_warning_count), its value
  can exceed
  [`max_error_count`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_max_error_count).
- If the [`sql_notes`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_sql_notes) system
  variable is set to 0, notes are not stored and do not
  increment [`warning_count`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_warning_count).

Example: If [`max_error_count`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_max_error_count)
is 10, the diagnostics area can contain a maximum of 10
condition areas. Suppose that a statement raises 20
conditions, 12 of which are errors. In that case, the
diagnostics area contains the first 10 conditions,
`NUMBER` is 10,
[`warning_count`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_warning_count) is 20, and
[`error_count`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_error_count) is 12.

Changes to the value of
[`max_error_count`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_max_error_count) have no
effect until the next attempt to modify the diagnostics area.
If the diagnostics area contains 10 condition areas and
[`max_error_count`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_max_error_count) is set to 5,
that has no immediate effect on the size or content of the
diagnostics area.
