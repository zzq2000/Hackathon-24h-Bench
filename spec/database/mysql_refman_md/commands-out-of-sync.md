#### B.3.2.12 Commands out of sync

If you get `Commands out of sync; you can't run this
command now` in your client code, you are calling
client functions in the wrong order.

This can happen, for example, if you are using
[`mysql_use_result()`](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/c-api/8.0/en/mysql-use-result.html) and try to
execute a new query before you have called
[`mysql_free_result()`](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/c-api/8.0/en/mysql-free-result.html). It can
also happen if you try to execute two queries that return data
without calling
[`mysql_use_result()`](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/c-api/8.0/en/mysql-use-result.html) or
[`mysql_store_result()`](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/c-api/8.0/en/mysql-store-result.html) in
between.
