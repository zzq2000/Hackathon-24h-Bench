### 2.8.5 Installing MySQL Using a Development Source Tree

This section describes how to install MySQL from the latest
development source code, which is hosted on
[GitHub](https://github.com/). To obtain the
MySQL Server source code from this repository hosting service, you
can set up a local MySQL Git repository.

On [GitHub](https://github.com/), MySQL Server
and other MySQL projects are found on the
[MySQL](https://github.com/mysql) page. The
MySQL Server project is a single repository that contains branches
for several MySQL series.

#### Prerequisites for Installing from Development Source

To install MySQL from a development source tree, your system
must satisfy the tool requirements listed at
[Section 2.8.2, “Source Installation Prerequisites”](source-installation-prerequisites.md "2.8.2 Source Installation Prerequisites").

#### Setting Up a MySQL Git Repository

To set up a MySQL Git repository on your machine:

1. Clone the MySQL Git repository to your machine. The
   following command clones the MySQL Git repository to a
   directory named `mysql-server`. The
   initial download may take some time to complete, depending
   on the speed of your connection.

   ```terminal
   $> git clone https://github.com/mysql/mysql-server.git
   Cloning into 'mysql-server'...
   remote: Counting objects: 1198513, done.
   remote: Total 1198513 (delta 0), reused 0 (delta 0), pack-reused 1198513
   Receiving objects: 100% (1198513/1198513), 1.01 GiB | 7.44 MiB/s, done.
   Resolving deltas: 100% (993200/993200), done.
   Checking connectivity... done.
   Checking out files: 100% (25510/25510), done.
   ```
2. When the clone operation completes, the contents of your
   local MySQL Git repository appear similar to the following:

   ```terminal
   ~> cd mysql-server
   ~/mysql-server> ls
   client             extra                mysys              storage
   cmake              include              packaging          strings
   CMakeLists.txt     INSTALL              plugin             support-files
   components         libbinlogevents      README             testclients
   config.h.cmake     libchangestreams     router             unittest
   configure.cmake    libmysql             run_doxygen.cmake  utilities
   Docs               libservices          scripts            VERSION
   Doxyfile-ignored   LICENSE              share              vio
   Doxyfile.in        man                  sql                win
   doxygen_resources  mysql-test           sql-common
   ```
3. Use the **git branch -r** command to view the
   remote tracking branches for the MySQL repository.

   ```terminal
   ~/mysql-server> git branch -r
     origin/5.7
     origin/8.0
     origin/HEAD -> origin/trunk
     origin/cluster-7.4
     origin/cluster-7.5
     origin/cluster-7.6
     origin/trunk
   ```
4. To view the branch that is checked out in your local
   repository, issue the **git branch** command.
   When you clone the MySQL Git repository, the latest MySQL
   branch is checked out automatically. The asterisk identifies
   the active branch.

   ```terminal
   ~/mysql-server$ git branch
   * trunk
   ```
5. To check out an earlier MySQL branch, run the **git
   checkout** command, specifying the branch name. For
   example, to check out the MySQL 5.7 branch:

   ```terminal
   ~/mysql-server$ git checkout 5.7
   Checking out files: 100% (9600/9600), done.
   Branch 5.7 set up to track remote branch 5.7 from origin.
   Switched to a new branch '5.7'
   ```
6. To obtain changes made after your initial setup of the MySQL
   Git repository, switch to the branch you want to update and
   issue the **git pull** command:

   ```terminal
   ~/mysql-server$ git checkout 8.0
   ~/mysql-server$ git pull
   ```

   To examine the commit history, use the **git
   log** command:

   ```terminal
   ~/mysql-server$ git log
   ```

   You can also browse commit history and source code on the
   GitHub [MySQL](https://github.com/mysql)
   site.

   If you see changes or code that you have a question about,
   ask on [MySQL
   Community Slack](https://mysqlcommunity.slack.com/).
7. After you have cloned the MySQL Git repository and have
   checked out the branch you want to build, you can build
   MySQL Server from the source code. Instructions are provided
   in [Section 2.8.4, “Installing MySQL Using a Standard Source Distribution”](installing-source-distribution.md "2.8.4 Installing MySQL Using a Standard Source Distribution"), except
   that you skip the part about obtaining and unpacking the
   distribution.

   Be careful about installing a build from a distribution
   source tree on a production machine. The installation
   command may overwrite your live release installation. If you
   already have MySQL installed and do not want to overwrite
   it, run **CMake** with values for the
   [`CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX`](source-configuration-options.md#option_cmake_cmake_install_prefix),
   [`MYSQL_TCP_PORT`](source-configuration-options.md#option_cmake_mysql_tcp_port), and
   [`MYSQL_UNIX_ADDR`](source-configuration-options.md#option_cmake_mysql_unix_addr) options
   different from those used by your production server. For
   additional information about preventing multiple servers
   from interfering with each other, see
   [Section 7.8, “Running Multiple MySQL Instances on One Machine”](multiple-servers.md "7.8 Running Multiple MySQL Instances on One Machine").

   Play hard with your new installation. For example, try to
   make new features crash. Start by running **make
   test**. See [The MySQL Test Suite](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/extending-mysql/8.0/en/mysql-test-suite.html).
