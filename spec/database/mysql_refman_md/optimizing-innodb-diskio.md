### 10.5.8 Optimizing InnoDB Disk I/O

If you follow best practices for database design and tuning
techniques for SQL operations, but your database is still slow
due to heavy disk I/O activity, consider these disk I/O
optimizations. If the Unix `top` tool or the
Windows Task Manager shows that the CPU usage percentage with
your workload is less than 70%, your workload is probably
disk-bound.

- Increase buffer pool size

  When table data is cached in the `InnoDB`
  buffer pool, it can be accessed repeatedly by queries
  without requiring any disk I/O. Specify the size of the
  buffer pool with the
  [`innodb_buffer_pool_size`](innodb-parameters.md#sysvar_innodb_buffer_pool_size)
  option. This memory area is important enough that it is
  typically recommended that
  [`innodb_buffer_pool_size`](innodb-parameters.md#sysvar_innodb_buffer_pool_size) is
  configured to 50 to 75 percent of system memory. For more
  information see, [Section 10.12.3.1, “How MySQL Uses Memory”](memory-use.md "10.12.3.1 How MySQL Uses Memory").
- Adjust the flush method

  In some versions of GNU/Linux and Unix, flushing files to
  disk with the Unix `fsync()` call (which
  `InnoDB` uses by default) and similar
  methods is surprisingly slow. If database write performance
  is an issue, conduct benchmarks with the
  [`innodb_flush_method`](innodb-parameters.md#sysvar_innodb_flush_method)
  parameter set to `O_DSYNC`.
- Configure a threshold for operating system flushes

  By default, when `InnoDB` creates a new
  data file, such as a new log file or tablespace file, the
  file is fully written to the operating system cache before
  it is flushed to disk, which can cause a large amount of
  disk write activity to occur at once. To force smaller,
  periodic flushes of data from the operating system cache,
  you can use the
  [`innodb_fsync_threshold`](innodb-parameters.md#sysvar_innodb_fsync_threshold)
  variable to define a threshold value, in bytes. When the
  byte threshold is reached, the contents of the operating
  system cache are flushed to disk. The default value of 0
  forces the default behavior, which is to flush data to disk
  only after a file is fully written to the cache.

  Specifying a threshold to force smaller, periodic flushes
  may be beneficial in cases where multiple MySQL instances
  use the same storage devices. For example, creating a new
  MySQL instance and its associated data files could cause
  large surges of disk write activity, impeding the
  performance of other MySQL instances that use the same
  storage devices. Configuring a threshold helps avoid such
  surges in write activity.
- Use fdatasync() instead of fsync()

  On platforms that support `fdatasync()`
  system calls, the
  [`innodb_use_fdatasync`](innodb-parameters.md#sysvar_innodb_use_fdatasync)
  variable, introduced in MySQL 8.0.26, permits using
  `fdatasync()` instead of
  `fsync()` for operating system flushes. An
  `fdatasync()` system call does not flush
  changes to file metadata unless required for subsequent data
  retrieval, providing a potential performance benefit.

  A subset of
  [`innodb_flush_method`](innodb-parameters.md#sysvar_innodb_flush_method)
  settings such as `fsync`,
  `O_DSYNC`, and `O_DIRECT`
  use `fsync()` system calls. The
  [`innodb_use_fdatasync`](innodb-parameters.md#sysvar_innodb_use_fdatasync)
  variable is applicable when using those settings.
- Use a noop or deadline I/O scheduler with native AIO on
  Linux

  `InnoDB` uses the asynchronous I/O
  subsystem (native AIO) on Linux to perform read-ahead and
  write requests for data file pages. This behavior is
  controlled by the
  [`innodb_use_native_aio`](innodb-parameters.md#sysvar_innodb_use_native_aio)
  configuration option, which is enabled by default. With
  native AIO, the type of I/O scheduler has greater influence
  on I/O performance. Generally, noop and deadline I/O
  schedulers are recommended. Conduct benchmarks to determine
  which I/O scheduler provides the best results for your
  workload and environment. For more information, see
  [Section 17.8.6, “Using Asynchronous I/O on Linux”](innodb-linux-native-aio.md "17.8.6 Using Asynchronous I/O on Linux").
- Use direct I/O on Solaris 10 for x86\_64 architecture

  When using the `InnoDB` storage engine on
  Solaris 10 for x86\_64 architecture (AMD Opteron), use direct
  I/O for `InnoDB`-related files to avoid
  degradation of `InnoDB` performance. To use
  direct I/O for an entire UFS file system used for storing
  `InnoDB`-related files, mount it with the
  `forcedirectio` option; see
  `mount_ufs(1M)`. (The default on Solaris
  10/x86\_64 is *not* to use this option.)
  To apply direct I/O only to `InnoDB` file
  operations rather than the whole file system, set
  [`innodb_flush_method =
  O_DIRECT`](innodb-parameters.md#sysvar_innodb_flush_method). With this setting,
  `InnoDB` calls
  `directio()` instead of
  `fcntl()` for I/O to data files (not for
  I/O to log files).
- Use raw storage for data and log files with Solaris 2.6 or
  later

  When using the `InnoDB` storage engine with
  a large
  [`innodb_buffer_pool_size`](innodb-parameters.md#sysvar_innodb_buffer_pool_size)
  value on any release of Solaris 2.6 and up and any platform
  (sparc/x86/x64/amd64), conduct benchmarks with
  `InnoDB` data files and log files on raw
  devices or on a separate direct I/O UFS file system, using
  the `forcedirectio` mount option as
  described previously. (It is necessary to use the mount
  option rather than setting
  [`innodb_flush_method`](innodb-parameters.md#sysvar_innodb_flush_method) if you
  want direct I/O for the log files.) Users of the Veritas
  file system VxFS should use the
  `convosync=direct` mount option.

  Do not place other MySQL data files, such as those for
  `MyISAM` tables, on a direct I/O file
  system. Executables or libraries *must
  not* be placed on a direct I/O file system.
- Use additional storage devices

  Additional storage devices could be used to set up a RAID
  configuration. For related information, see
  [Section 10.12.1, “Optimizing Disk I/O”](disk-issues.md "10.12.1 Optimizing Disk I/O").

  Alternatively, `InnoDB` tablespace data
  files and log files can be placed on different physical
  disks. For more information, refer to the following
  sections:

  - [Section 17.8.1, “InnoDB Startup Configuration”](innodb-init-startup-configuration.md "17.8.1 InnoDB Startup Configuration")
  - [Section 17.6.1.2, “Creating Tables Externally”](innodb-create-table-external.md "17.6.1.2 Creating Tables Externally")
  - [Creating a General Tablespace](general-tablespaces.md#general-tablespaces-creating "Creating a General Tablespace")
  - [Section 17.6.1.4, “Moving or Copying InnoDB Tables”](innodb-migration.md "17.6.1.4 Moving or Copying InnoDB Tables")
- Consider non-rotational storage

  Non-rotational storage generally provides better performance
  for random I/O operations; and rotational storage for
  sequential I/O operations. When distributing data and log
  files across rotational and non-rotational storage devices,
  consider the type of I/O operations that are predominantly
  performed on each file.

  Random I/O-oriented files typically include
  [file-per-table](glossary.md#glos_file_per_table "file-per-table")
  and [general
  tablespace](glossary.md#glos_general_tablespace "general tablespace") data files,
  [undo tablespace](glossary.md#glos_undo_tablespace "undo tablespace")
  files, and
  [temporary
  tablespace](glossary.md#glos_temporary_tablespace "temporary tablespace") files. Sequential I/O-oriented files
  include `InnoDB`
  [system
  tablespace](glossary.md#glos_system_tablespace "system tablespace") files (due to
  [doublewrite
  buffering](glossary.md#glos_doublewrite_buffer "doublewrite buffer") prior to MySQL 8.0.20 and
  [change buffering](glossary.md#glos_change_buffer "change buffer")),
  doublewrite files introduced in MySQL 8.0.20, and log files
  such as [binary log](glossary.md#glos_binary_log "binary log")
  files and [redo log](glossary.md#glos_redo_log "redo log")
  files.

  Review settings for the following configuration options when
  using non-rotational storage:

  - [`innodb_checksum_algorithm`](innodb-parameters.md#sysvar_innodb_checksum_algorithm)

    The `crc32` option uses a faster
    checksum algorithm and is recommended for fast storage
    systems.
  - [`innodb_flush_neighbors`](innodb-parameters.md#sysvar_innodb_flush_neighbors)

    Optimizes I/O for rotational storage devices. Disable it
    for non-rotational storage or a mix of rotational and
    non-rotational storage. It is disabled by default.
  - [`innodb_idle_flush_pct`](innodb-parameters.md#sysvar_innodb_idle_flush_pct)

    Permits placing a limit on page flushing during idle
    periods, which can help extend the life of
    non-rotational storage devices. Introduced in MySQL
    8.0.18.
  - [`innodb_io_capacity`](innodb-parameters.md#sysvar_innodb_io_capacity)

    The default setting of 200 is generally sufficient for a
    lower-end non-rotational storage device. For higher-end,
    bus-attached devices, consider a higher setting such as
    1000.
  - [`innodb_io_capacity_max`](innodb-parameters.md#sysvar_innodb_io_capacity_max)

    The default value of 2000 is intended for workloads that
    use non-rotational storage. For a high-end, bus-attached
    non-rotational storage device, consider a higher setting
    such as 2500.
  - [`innodb_log_compressed_pages`](innodb-parameters.md#sysvar_innodb_log_compressed_pages)

    If redo logs are on non-rotational storage, consider
    disabling this option to reduce logging. See
    [Disable
    logging of compressed pages](optimizing-innodb-diskio.md#innodb-disable-log-compressed-pages).
  - [`innodb_log_file_size`](innodb-parameters.md#sysvar_innodb_log_file_size)
    (deprecated in MySQL 8.0.30)

    If redo logs are on non-rotational storage, configure
    this option to maximize caching and write combining.
  - [`innodb_redo_log_capacity`](innodb-parameters.md#sysvar_innodb_redo_log_capacity)

    If redo logs are on non-rotational storage, configure
    this option to maximize caching and write combining.
  - [`innodb_page_size`](innodb-parameters.md#sysvar_innodb_page_size)

    Consider using a page size that matches the internal
    sector size of the disk. Early-generation SSD devices
    often have a 4KB sector size. Some newer devices have a
    16KB sector size. The default `InnoDB`
    page size is 16KB. Keeping the page size close to the
    storage device block size minimizes the amount of
    unchanged data that is rewritten to disk.
  - [`binlog_row_image`](replication-options-binary-log.md#sysvar_binlog_row_image)

    If binary logs are on non-rotational storage and all
    tables have primary keys, consider setting this option
    to `minimal` to reduce logging.
  - [`innodb_doublewrite_pages`](innodb-parameters.md#sysvar_innodb_doublewrite_pages)

    The default value of 4 (copied from
    [`innodb_write_io_threads`](innodb-parameters.md#sysvar_innodb_write_io_threads))
    could mean too many fsync operations for doublewrite
    operations. Consider increasing the value, which
    defaults to 128 instead of 4 as of MySQL 8.4.0.

    Note

    Although this option was introduced in MySQL 8.0.20,
    its behavior was 120 in MySQL 5.7. This change could
    cause a performance degradation for some operations,
    such as using `ALTER` to rebuild a
    table with the `INPLACE` algorithm.

  Ensure that TRIM support is enabled for your operating
  system. It is typically enabled by default.
- Increase I/O capacity to avoid backlogs

  If throughput drops periodically because of
  `InnoDB`
  [checkpoint](glossary.md#glos_checkpoint "checkpoint")
  operations, consider increasing the value of the
  [`innodb_io_capacity`](innodb-parameters.md#sysvar_innodb_io_capacity)
  configuration option. Higher values cause more frequent
  [flushing](glossary.md#glos_flush "flush"), avoiding the
  backlog of work that can cause dips in throughput.
- Lower I/O capacity if flushing does not fall behind

  If the system is not falling behind with
  `InnoDB`
  [flushing](glossary.md#glos_flush "flush") operations,
  consider lowering the value of the
  [`innodb_io_capacity`](innodb-parameters.md#sysvar_innodb_io_capacity)
  configuration option. Typically, you keep this option value
  as low as practical, but not so low that it causes periodic
  drops in throughput as mentioned in the preceding bullet. In
  a typical scenario where you could lower the option value,
  you might see a combination like this in the output from
  [`SHOW ENGINE
  INNODB STATUS`](show-engine.md "15.7.7.15 SHOW ENGINE Statement"):

  - History list length low, below a few thousand.
  - Insert buffer merges close to rows inserted.
  - Modified pages in buffer pool consistently well below
    [`innodb_max_dirty_pages_pct`](innodb-parameters.md#sysvar_innodb_max_dirty_pages_pct)
    of the buffer pool. (Measure at a time when the server
    is not doing bulk inserts; it is normal during bulk
    inserts for the modified pages percentage to rise
    significantly.)
  - `Log sequence number - Last checkpoint`
    is at less than 7/8 or ideally less than 6/8 of the
    total size of the `InnoDB`
    [log files](glossary.md#glos_log_file "log file").
- Store system tablespace files on Fusion-io devices

  You can take advantage of a doublewrite buffer-related I/O
  optimization by storing the files that contain the
  doublewrite storage area on Fusion-io devices that support
  atomic writes. (Prior to MySQL 8.0.20, the doublewrite
  buffer storage are resides in the system tablespace data
  files. As of MySQL 8.0.20, the storage area resides in
  doublewrite files. See
  [Section 17.6.4, “Doublewrite Buffer”](innodb-doublewrite-buffer.md "17.6.4 Doublewrite Buffer").) When
  doublewrite storage area files are placed on Fusion-io
  devices that support atomic writes, the doublewrite buffer
  is automatically disabled and Fusion-io atomic writes are
  used for all data files. This feature is only supported on
  Fusion-io hardware and is only enabled for Fusion-io NVMFS
  on Linux. To take full advantage of this feature, an
  [`innodb_flush_method`](innodb-parameters.md#sysvar_innodb_flush_method) setting
  of `O_DIRECT` is recommended.

  Note

  Because the doublewrite buffer setting is global, the
  doublewrite buffer is also disabled for data files that do
  not reside on Fusion-io hardware.
- Disable logging of compressed pages

  When using the `InnoDB` table
  [compression](glossary.md#glos_compression "compression") feature,
  images of re-compressed
  [pages](glossary.md#glos_page "page") are written to the
  [redo log](glossary.md#glos_redo_log "redo log") when changes
  are made to compressed data. This behavior is controlled by
  [`innodb_log_compressed_pages`](innodb-parameters.md#sysvar_innodb_log_compressed_pages),
  which is enabled by default to prevent corruption that can
  occur if a different version of the `zlib`
  compression algorithm is used during recovery. If you are
  certain that the `zlib` version is not
  subject to change, disable
  [`innodb_log_compressed_pages`](innodb-parameters.md#sysvar_innodb_log_compressed_pages)
  to reduce redo log generation for workloads that modify
  compressed data.
