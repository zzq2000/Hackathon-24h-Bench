#### 29.12.20.10 Memory Summary Tables

The Performance Schema instruments memory usage and aggregates
memory usage statistics, detailed by these factors:

- Type of memory used (various caches, internal buffers, and
  so forth)
- Thread, account, user, host indirectly performing the
  memory operation

The Performance Schema instruments the following aspects of
memory use

- Memory sizes used
- Operation counts
- Low and high water marks

Memory sizes help to understand or tune the memory consumption
of the server.

Operation counts help to understand or tune the overall
pressure the server is putting on the memory allocator, which
has an impact on performance. Allocating a single byte one
million times is not the same as allocating one million bytes
a single time; tracking both sizes and counts can expose the
difference.

Low and high water marks are critical to detect workload
spikes, overall workload stability, and possible memory leaks.

Memory summary tables do not contain timing information
because memory events are not timed.

For information about collecting memory usage data, see
[Memory Instrumentation Behavior](performance-schema-memory-summary-tables.md#memory-instrumentation-behavior "Memory Instrumentation Behavior").

Example memory event summary information:

```sql
mysql> SELECT *
       FROM performance_schema.memory_summary_global_by_event_name
       WHERE EVENT_NAME = 'memory/sql/TABLE'\G
*************************** 1. row ***************************
                  EVENT_NAME: memory/sql/TABLE
                 COUNT_ALLOC: 1381
                  COUNT_FREE: 924
   SUM_NUMBER_OF_BYTES_ALLOC: 2059873
    SUM_NUMBER_OF_BYTES_FREE: 1407432
              LOW_COUNT_USED: 0
          CURRENT_COUNT_USED: 457
             HIGH_COUNT_USED: 461
    LOW_NUMBER_OF_BYTES_USED: 0
CURRENT_NUMBER_OF_BYTES_USED: 652441
   HIGH_NUMBER_OF_BYTES_USED: 669269
```

Each memory summary table has one or more grouping columns to
indicate how the table aggregates events. Event names refer to
names of event instruments in the
[`setup_instruments`](performance-schema-setup-instruments-table.md "29.12.2.3 The setup_instruments Table") table:

- [`memory_summary_by_account_by_event_name`](performance-schema-memory-summary-tables.md "29.12.20.10 Memory Summary Tables")
  has `USER`, `HOST`, and
  `EVENT_NAME` columns. Each row summarizes
  events for a given account (user and host combination) and
  event name.
- [`memory_summary_by_host_by_event_name`](performance-schema-memory-summary-tables.md "29.12.20.10 Memory Summary Tables")
  has `HOST` and
  `EVENT_NAME` columns. Each row summarizes
  events for a given host and event name.
- [`memory_summary_by_thread_by_event_name`](performance-schema-memory-summary-tables.md "29.12.20.10 Memory Summary Tables")
  has `THREAD_ID` and
  `EVENT_NAME` columns. Each row summarizes
  events for a given thread and event name.
- [`memory_summary_by_user_by_event_name`](performance-schema-memory-summary-tables.md "29.12.20.10 Memory Summary Tables")
  has `USER` and
  `EVENT_NAME` columns. Each row summarizes
  events for a given user and event name.
- [`memory_summary_global_by_event_name`](performance-schema-memory-summary-tables.md "29.12.20.10 Memory Summary Tables")
  has an `EVENT_NAME` column. Each row
  summarizes events for a given event name.

Each memory summary table has these summary columns containing
aggregated values:

- `COUNT_ALLOC`,
  `COUNT_FREE`

  The aggregated numbers of calls to memory-allocation and
  memory-free functions.
- `SUM_NUMBER_OF_BYTES_ALLOC`,
  `SUM_NUMBER_OF_BYTES_FREE`

  The aggregated sizes of allocated and freed memory blocks.
- `CURRENT_COUNT_USED`

  The aggregated number of currently allocated blocks that
  have not been freed yet. This is a convenience column,
  equal to `COUNT_ALLOC` −
  `COUNT_FREE`.
- `CURRENT_NUMBER_OF_BYTES_USED`

  The aggregated size of currently allocated memory blocks
  that have not been freed yet. This is a convenience
  column, equal to
  `SUM_NUMBER_OF_BYTES_ALLOC` −
  `SUM_NUMBER_OF_BYTES_FREE`.
- `LOW_COUNT_USED`,
  `HIGH_COUNT_USED`

  The low and high water marks corresponding to the
  `CURRENT_COUNT_USED` column.
- `LOW_NUMBER_OF_BYTES_USED`,
  `HIGH_NUMBER_OF_BYTES_USED`

  The low and high water marks corresponding to the
  `CURRENT_NUMBER_OF_BYTES_USED` column.

The memory summary tables have these indexes:

- [`memory_summary_by_account_by_event_name`](performance-schema-memory-summary-tables.md "29.12.20.10 Memory Summary Tables"):

  - Primary key on (`USER`,
    `HOST`,
    `EVENT_NAME`)
- [`memory_summary_by_host_by_event_name`](performance-schema-memory-summary-tables.md "29.12.20.10 Memory Summary Tables"):

  - Primary key on (`HOST`,
    `EVENT_NAME`)
- [`memory_summary_by_thread_by_event_name`](performance-schema-memory-summary-tables.md "29.12.20.10 Memory Summary Tables"):

  - Primary key on (`THREAD_ID`,
    `EVENT_NAME`)
- [`memory_summary_by_user_by_event_name`](performance-schema-memory-summary-tables.md "29.12.20.10 Memory Summary Tables"):

  - Primary key on (`USER`,
    `EVENT_NAME`)
- [`memory_summary_global_by_event_name`](performance-schema-memory-summary-tables.md "29.12.20.10 Memory Summary Tables"):

  - Primary key on (`EVENT_NAME`)

[`TRUNCATE TABLE`](truncate-table.md "15.1.37 TRUNCATE TABLE Statement") is permitted for
memory summary tables. It has these effects:

- In general, truncation resets the baseline for statistics,
  but does not change the server state. That is, truncating
  a memory table does not free memory.
- `COUNT_ALLOC` and
  `COUNT_FREE` are reset to a new baseline,
  by reducing each counter by the same value.
- Likewise, `SUM_NUMBER_OF_BYTES_ALLOC` and
  `SUM_NUMBER_OF_BYTES_FREE` are reset to a
  new baseline.
- `LOW_COUNT_USED` and
  `HIGH_COUNT_USED` are reset to
  `CURRENT_COUNT_USED`.
- `LOW_NUMBER_OF_BYTES_USED` and
  `HIGH_NUMBER_OF_BYTES_USED` are reset to
  `CURRENT_NUMBER_OF_BYTES_USED`.

In addition, each memory summary table that is aggregated by
account, host, user, or thread is implicitly truncated by
truncation of the connection table on which it depends, or
truncation of
[`memory_summary_global_by_event_name`](performance-schema-memory-summary-tables.md "29.12.20.10 Memory Summary Tables").
For details, see
[Section 29.12.8, “Performance Schema Connection Tables”](performance-schema-connection-tables.md "29.12.8 Performance Schema Connection Tables").

##### Memory Instrumentation Behavior

Memory instruments are listed in the
[`setup_instruments`](performance-schema-setup-instruments-table.md "29.12.2.3 The setup_instruments Table") table and
have names of the form
`memory/code_area/instrument_name`.
Memory instrumentation is enabled by default.

Instruments named with the prefix
`memory/performance_schema/` expose how
much memory is allocated for internal buffers in the
Performance Schema itself. The
`memory/performance_schema/` instruments
are built in, always enabled, and cannot be disabled at
startup or runtime. Built-in memory instruments are
displayed only in the
[`memory_summary_global_by_event_name`](performance-schema-memory-summary-tables.md "29.12.20.10 Memory Summary Tables")
table.

To control memory instrumentation state at server startup,
use lines like these in your `my.cnf`
file:

- Enable:

  ```ini
  [mysqld]
  performance-schema-instrument='memory/%=ON'
  ```
- Disable:

  ```ini
  [mysqld]
  performance-schema-instrument='memory/%=OFF'
  ```

To control memory instrumentation state at runtime, update
the `ENABLED` column of the relevant
instruments in the
[`setup_instruments`](performance-schema-setup-instruments-table.md "29.12.2.3 The setup_instruments Table") table:

- Enable:

  ```sql
  UPDATE performance_schema.setup_instruments
  SET ENABLED = 'YES'
  WHERE NAME LIKE 'memory/%';
  ```
- Disable:

  ```sql
  UPDATE performance_schema.setup_instruments
  SET ENABLED = 'NO'
  WHERE NAME LIKE 'memory/%';
  ```

For memory instruments, the `TIMED` column
in [`setup_instruments`](performance-schema-setup-instruments-table.md "29.12.2.3 The setup_instruments Table") is ignored
because memory operations are not timed.

When a thread in the server executes a memory allocation
that has been instrumented, these rules apply:

- If the thread is not instrumented or the memory
  instrument is not enabled, the memory block allocated is
  not instrumented.
- Otherwise (that is, both the thread and the instrument
  are enabled), the memory block allocated is
  instrumented.

For deallocation, these rules apply:

- If a memory allocation operation was instrumented, the
  corresponding free operation is instrumented, regardless
  of the current instrument or thread enabled status.
- If a memory allocation operation was not instrumented,
  the corresponding free operation is not instrumented,
  regardless of the current instrument or thread enabled
  status.

For the per-thread statistics, the following rules apply.

When an instrumented memory block of size
*`N`* is allocated, the Performance
Schema makes these updates to memory summary table columns:

- `COUNT_ALLOC`: Increased by 1
- `CURRENT_COUNT_USED`: Increased by 1
- `HIGH_COUNT_USED`: Increased if
  `CURRENT_COUNT_USED` is a new maximum
- `SUM_NUMBER_OF_BYTES_ALLOC`: Increased
  by *`N`*
- `CURRENT_NUMBER_OF_BYTES_USED`:
  Increased by *`N`*
- `HIGH_NUMBER_OF_BYTES_USED`: Increased
  if `CURRENT_NUMBER_OF_BYTES_USED` is a
  new maximum

When an instrumented memory block is deallocated, the
Performance Schema makes these updates to memory summary
table columns:

- `COUNT_FREE`: Increased by 1
- `CURRENT_COUNT_USED`: Decreased by 1
- `LOW_COUNT_USED`: Decreased if
  `CURRENT_COUNT_USED` is a new minimum
- `SUM_NUMBER_OF_BYTES_FREE`: Increased
  by *`N`*
- `CURRENT_NUMBER_OF_BYTES_USED`:
  Decreased by *`N`*
- `LOW_NUMBER_OF_BYTES_USED`: Decreased
  if `CURRENT_NUMBER_OF_BYTES_USED` is a
  new minimum

For higher-level aggregates (global, by account, by user, by
host), the same rules apply as expected for low and high
water marks.

- `LOW_COUNT_USED` and
  `LOW_NUMBER_OF_BYTES_USED` are lower
  estimates. The value reported by the Performance Schema
  is guaranteed to be less than or equal to the lowest
  count or size of memory effectively used at runtime.
- `HIGH_COUNT_USED` and
  `HIGH_NUMBER_OF_BYTES_USED` are higher
  estimates. The value reported by the Performance Schema
  is guaranteed to be greater than or equal to the highest
  count or size of memory effectively used at runtime.

For lower estimates in summary tables other than
[`memory_summary_global_by_event_name`](performance-schema-memory-summary-tables.md "29.12.20.10 Memory Summary Tables"),
it is possible for values to go negative if memory ownership
is transferred between threads.

Here is an example of estimate computation; but note that
estimate implementation is subject to change:

Thread 1 uses memory in the range from 1MB to 2MB during
execution, as reported by the
`LOW_NUMBER_OF_BYTES_USED` and
`HIGH_NUMBER_OF_BYTES_USED` columns of the
[`memory_summary_by_thread_by_event_name`](performance-schema-memory-summary-tables.md "29.12.20.10 Memory Summary Tables")
table.

Thread 2 uses memory in the range from 10MB to 12MB during
execution, as reported likewise.

When these two threads belong to the same user account, the
per-account summary estimates that this account used memory
in the range from 11MB to 14MB. That is, the
`LOW_NUMBER_OF_BYTES_USED` for the higher
level aggregate is the sum of each
`LOW_NUMBER_OF_BYTES_USED` (assuming the
worst case). Likewise, the
`HIGH_NUMBER_OF_BYTES_USED` for the higher
level aggregate is the sum of each
`HIGH_NUMBER_OF_BYTES_USED` (assuming the
worst case).

11MB is a lower estimate that can occur only if both threads
hit the low usage mark at the same time.

14MB is a higher estimate that can occur only if both
threads hit the high usage mark at the same time.

The real memory usage for this account could have been in
the range from 11.5MB to 13.5MB.

For capacity planning, reporting the worst case is actually
the desired behavior, as it shows what can potentially
happen when sessions are uncorrelated, which is typically
the case.
