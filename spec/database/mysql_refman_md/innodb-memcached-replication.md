### 17.20.7 The InnoDB memcached Plugin and Replication

Because the `daemon_memcached` plugin supports
the MySQL [binary log](glossary.md#glos_binary_log "binary log"),
source server through the **memcached** interface
can be replicated for backup, balancing intensive read workloads,
and high availability. All **memcached** commands
are supported with binary logging.

You do not need to set up the `daemon_memcached`
plugin on replica servers. The primary advantage of this
configuration is increased write throughput on the source. The
speed of the replication mechanism is not affected.

The following sections show how to use the binary log capability
when using the `daemon_memcached` plugin with
MySQL replication. It is assumed that you have completed the setup
described in [Section 17.20.3, “Setting Up the InnoDB memcached Plugin”](innodb-memcached-setup.md "17.20.3 Setting Up the InnoDB memcached Plugin").

#### Enabling the InnoDB memcached Binary Log

1. To use the `daemon_memcached` plugin with
   the MySQL [binary log](glossary.md#glos_binary_log "binary log"),
   enable the
   [`innodb_api_enable_binlog`](innodb-parameters.md#sysvar_innodb_api_enable_binlog)
   configuration option on the source server. This option can
   only be set at server startup. You must also enable the
   MySQL binary log on the source server using the
   [`--log-bin`](replication-options-binary-log.md#sysvar_log_bin) option. You can
   add these options to the MySQL configuration file, or on the
   [**mysqld**](mysqld.md "6.3.1 mysqld — The MySQL Server") command line.

   ```terminal
   mysqld ... --log-bin -–innodb_api_enable_binlog=1
   ```
2. Configure the source and replica server, as described in
   [Section 19.1.2, “Setting Up Binary Log File Position Based Replication”](replication-howto.md "19.1.2 Setting Up Binary Log File Position Based Replication").
3. Use [**mysqldump**](mysqldump.md "6.5.4 mysqldump — A Database Backup Program") to create a source data
   snapshot, and sync the snapshot to the replica server.

   ```terminal
   source $> mysqldump --all-databases --lock-all-tables > dbdump.db
   replica $> mysql < dbdump.db
   ```
4. On the source server, issue [`SHOW MASTER
   STATUS`](show-master-status.md "15.7.7.23 SHOW MASTER STATUS Statement") to obtain the source binary log
   coordinates.

   ```sql
   mysql> SHOW MASTER STATUS;
   ```
5. On the replica server, use a [`CHANGE
   REPLICATION SOURCE TO`](change-replication-source-to.md "15.4.2.3 CHANGE REPLICATION SOURCE TO Statement") statement (from MySQL
   8.0.23) or [`CHANGE MASTER TO`](change-master-to.md "15.4.2.1 CHANGE MASTER TO Statement")
   statement (before MySQL 8.0.23) to set up a replica server
   using the source binary log coordinates.

   ```sql
   mysql> CHANGE MASTER TO
          MASTER_HOST='localhost',
          MASTER_USER='root',
          MASTER_PASSWORD='',
          MASTER_PORT = 13000,
          MASTER_LOG_FILE='0.000001,
          MASTER_LOG_POS=114;

   Or from MySQL 8.0.23:
   mysql> CHANGE REPLICATION SOURCE TO
          SOURCE_HOST='localhost',
          SOURCE_USER='root',
          SOURCE_PASSWORD='',
          SOURCE_PORT = 13000,
          SOURCE_LOG_FILE='0.000001,
          SOURCE_LOG_POS=114;
   ```
6. Start the replica.

   ```sql
   mysql> START SLAVE;
   Or from MySQL 8.0.22:
   mysql> START REPLICA;
   ```

   If the error log prints output similar to the following, the
   replica is ready for replication.

   ```terminal
   2013-09-24T13:04:38.639684Z 49 [Note] Replication I/O thread: connected to
   source 'root@localhost:13000', replication started in log '0.000001'
   at position 114
   ```

#### Testing the InnoDB memcached Replication Configuration

This example demonstrates how to test the
`InnoDB` **memcached**
replication configuration using the **memcached**
and telnet to insert, update, and delete data. A MySQL client is
used to verify results on the source and replica servers.

The example uses the `demo_test` table, which
was created by the
`innodb_memcached_config.sql` configuration
script during the initial setup of the
`daemon_memcached` plugin. The
`demo_test` table contains a single example
record.

1. Use the `set` command to insert a record
   with a key of `test1`, a flag value of
   `10`, an expiration value of
   `0`, a cas value of 1, and a value of
   `t1`.

   ```terminal
   telnet 127.0.0.1 11211
   Trying 127.0.0.1...
   Connected to 127.0.0.1.
   Escape character is '^]'.
   set test1 10 0 1
   t1
   STORED
   ```
2. On the source server, check that the record was inserted
   into the `demo_test` table. Assuming the
   `demo_test` table was not previously
   modified, there should be two records. The example record
   with a key of `AA`, and the record you just
   inserted, with a key of `test1`. The
   `c1` column maps to the key, the
   `c2` column to the value, the
   `c3` column to the flag value, the
   `c4` column to the cas value, and the
   `c5` column to the expiration time. The
   expiration time was set to 0, since it is unused.

   ```sql
   mysql> SELECT * FROM test.demo_test;
   +-------+--------------+------+------+------+
   | c1    | c2           | c3   | c4   | c5   |
   +-------+--------------+------+------+------+
   | AA    | HELLO, HELLO |    8 |    0 |    0 |
   | test1 | t1           |   10 |    1 |    0 |
   +-------+--------------+------+------+------+
   ```
3. Check to verify that the same record was replicated to the
   replica server.

   ```sql
   mysql> SELECT * FROM test.demo_test;
   +-------+--------------+------+------+------+
   | c1    | c2           | c3   | c4   | c5   |
   +-------+--------------+------+------+------+
   | AA    | HELLO, HELLO |    8 |    0 |    0 |
   | test1 | t1           |   10 |    1 |    0 |
   +-------+--------------+------+------+------+
   ```
4. Use the `set` command to update the key to
   a value of `new`.

   ```terminal
   telnet 127.0.0.1 11211
   Trying 127.0.0.1...
   Connected to 127.0.0.1.
   Escape character is '^]'.
   set test1 10 0 2
   new
   STORED
   ```

   The update is replicated to the replica server (notice that
   the `cas` value is also updated).

   ```sql
   mysql> SELECT * FROM test.demo_test;
   +-------+--------------+------+------+------+
   | c1    | c2           | c3   | c4   | c5   |
   +-------+--------------+------+------+------+
   | AA    | HELLO, HELLO |    8 |    0 |    0 |
   | test1 | new          |   10 |    2 |    0 |
   +-------+--------------+------+------+------+
   ```
5. Delete the `test1` record using a
   `delete` command.

   ```terminal
   telnet 127.0.0.1 11211
   Trying 127.0.0.1...
   Connected to 127.0.0.1.
   Escape character is '^]'.
   delete test1
   DELETED
   ```

   When the `delete` operation is replicated
   to the replica, the `test1` record on the
   replica is also deleted.

   ```sql
   mysql> SELECT * FROM test.demo_test;
   +----+--------------+------+------+------+
   | c1 | c2           | c3   | c4   | c5   |
   +----+--------------+------+------+------+
   | AA | HELLO, HELLO |    8 |    0 |    0 |
   +----+--------------+------+------+------+
   ```
6. Remove all rows from the table using the
   `flush_all` command.

   ```terminal
   telnet 127.0.0.1 11211
   Trying 127.0.0.1...
   Connected to 127.0.0.1.
   Escape character is '^]'.
   flush_all
   OK
   ```

   ```sql
   mysql> SELECT * FROM test.demo_test;
   Empty set (0.00 sec)
   ```
7. Telnet to the source server and enter two new records.

   ```terminal
   telnet 127.0.0.1 11211
   Trying 127.0.0.1...
   Connected to 127.0.0.1.
   Escape character is '^]'
   set test2 10 0 4
   again
   STORED
   set test3 10 0 5
   again1
   STORED
   ```
8. Confirm that the two records were replicated to the replica
   server.

   ```sql
   mysql> SELECT * FROM test.demo_test;
   +-------+--------------+------+------+------+
   | c1    | c2           | c3   | c4   | c5   |
   +-------+--------------+------+------+------+
   | test2 | again        |   10 |    4 |    0 |
   | test3 | again1       |   10 |    5 |    0 |
   +-------+--------------+------+------+------+
   ```
9. Remove all rows from the table using the
   `flush_all` command.

   ```terminal
   telnet 127.0.0.1 11211
   Trying 127.0.0.1...
   Connected to 127.0.0.1.
   Escape character is '^]'.
   flush_all
   OK
   ```
10. Check to ensure that the `flush_all`
    operation was replicated on the replica server.

    ```sql
    mysql> SELECT * FROM test.demo_test;
    Empty set (0.00 sec)
    ```

#### InnoDB memcached Binary Log Notes

Binary Log Format:

- Most **memcached** operations are mapped to
  [DML](glossary.md#glos_dml "DML") statements (analogous to
  insert, delete, update). Since there is no actual SQL
  statement being processed by the MySQL server, all
  **memcached** commands (except for
  `flush_all`) use Row-Based Replication
  (RBR) logging, which is independent of any server
  [`binlog_format`](replication-options-binary-log.md#sysvar_binlog_format) setting.
- The **memcached**
  `flush_all` command is mapped to the
  [`TRUNCATE TABLE`](truncate-table.md "15.1.37 TRUNCATE TABLE Statement") command in
  MySQL 5.7 and earlier. Since
  [DDL](glossary.md#glos_ddl "DDL") commands can only use
  statement-based logging, the `flush_all`
  command is replicated by sending a
  [`TRUNCATE TABLE`](truncate-table.md "15.1.37 TRUNCATE TABLE Statement") statement. In
  MySQL 8.0 and later, `flush_all` is mapped
  to `DELETE` but is still replicated by
  sending a [`TRUNCATE TABLE`](truncate-table.md "15.1.37 TRUNCATE TABLE Statement")
  statement.

Transactions:

- The concept of
  [transactions](glossary.md#glos_transaction "transaction") has not
  typically been part of **memcached**
  applications. For performance considerations,
  [`daemon_memcached_r_batch_size`](innodb-parameters.md#sysvar_daemon_memcached_r_batch_size)
  and
  [`daemon_memcached_w_batch_size`](innodb-parameters.md#sysvar_daemon_memcached_w_batch_size)
  are used to control the batch size for read and write
  transactions. These settings do not affect replication. Each
  SQL operation on the underlying `InnoDB`
  table is replicated after successful completion.
- The default value of
  [`daemon_memcached_w_batch_size`](innodb-parameters.md#sysvar_daemon_memcached_w_batch_size)
  is `1`, which means that each
  **memcached** write operation is committed
  immediately. This default setting incurs a certain amount of
  performance overhead to avoid inconsistencies in the data
  that is visible on the source and replica servers. The
  replicated records are always available immediately on the
  replica server. If you set
  [`daemon_memcached_w_batch_size`](innodb-parameters.md#sysvar_daemon_memcached_w_batch_size)
  to a value greater than `1`, records
  inserted or updated through **memcached** are
  not immediately visible on the source server; to view the
  records on the source server before they are committed,
  issue [`SET
  TRANSACTION ISOLATION LEVEL READ UNCOMMITTED`](set-transaction.md "15.3.7 SET TRANSACTION Statement").
