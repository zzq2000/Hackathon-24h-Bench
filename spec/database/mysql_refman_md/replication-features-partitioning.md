#### 19.5.1.24 Replication and Partitioning

Replication is supported between partitioned tables as long as
they use the same partitioning scheme and otherwise have the
same structure, except where an exception is specifically
allowed (see
[Section 19.5.1.9, “Replication with Differing Table Definitions on Source and Replica”](replication-features-differing-tables.md "19.5.1.9 Replication with Differing Table Definitions on Source and Replica")).

Replication between tables that have different partitioning is
generally not supported. This because statements (such as
[`ALTER
TABLE ... DROP PARTITION`](alter-table-partition-operations.md "15.1.9.1 ALTER TABLE Partition Operations")) that act directly on
partitions in such cases might produce different results on the
source and the replica. In the case where a table is partitioned
on the source but not on the replica, any statements that
operate on partitions on the source's copy of the replica
fail on the replica. When the replica's copy of the table
is partitioned but the source's copy is not, statements
that act directly on partitions cannot be run on the source
without causing errors there. To avoid stopping replication or
creating inconsistencies between the source and replica, always
ensure that a table on the source and the corresponding
replicated table on the replica are partitioned in the same way.
