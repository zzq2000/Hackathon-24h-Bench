### 28.3.48 The INFORMATION\_SCHEMA VIEWS Table

The [`VIEWS`](information-schema-views-table.md "28.3.48 The INFORMATION_SCHEMA VIEWS Table") table provides information
about views in databases. You must have the
[`SHOW VIEW`](privileges-provided.md#priv_show-view) privilege to access this
table.

The [`VIEWS`](information-schema-views-table.md "28.3.48 The INFORMATION_SCHEMA VIEWS Table") table has these columns:

- `TABLE_CATALOG`

  The name of the catalog to which the view belongs. This value
  is always `def`.
- `TABLE_SCHEMA`

  The name of the schema (database) to which the view belongs.
- `TABLE_NAME`

  The name of the view.
- `VIEW_DEFINITION`

  The [`SELECT`](select.md "15.2.13 SELECT Statement") statement that
  provides the definition of the view. This column has most of
  what you see in the `Create Table` column
  that [`SHOW CREATE VIEW`](show-create-view.md "15.7.7.13 SHOW CREATE VIEW Statement") produces.
  Skip the words before [`SELECT`](select.md "15.2.13 SELECT Statement")
  and skip the words `WITH CHECK OPTION`.
  Suppose that the original statement was:

  ```sql
  CREATE VIEW v AS
    SELECT s2,s1 FROM t
    WHERE s1 > 5
    ORDER BY s1
    WITH CHECK OPTION;
  ```

  Then the view definition looks like this:

  ```sql
  SELECT s2,s1 FROM t WHERE s1 > 5 ORDER BY s1
  ```
- `CHECK_OPTION`

  The value of the `CHECK_OPTION` attribute.
  The value is one of `NONE`,
  `CASCADE`, or `LOCAL`.
- `IS_UPDATABLE`

  MySQL sets a flag, called the view updatability flag, at
  [`CREATE VIEW`](create-view.md "15.1.23 CREATE VIEW Statement") time. The flag is
  set to `YES` (true) if
  [`UPDATE`](update.md "15.2.17 UPDATE Statement") and
  [`DELETE`](delete.md "15.2.2 DELETE Statement") (and similar operations)
  are legal for the view. Otherwise, the flag is set to
  `NO` (false). The
  `IS_UPDATABLE` column in the
  [`VIEWS`](information-schema-views-table.md "28.3.48 The INFORMATION_SCHEMA VIEWS Table") table displays the status
  of this flag. It means that the server always knows whether a
  view is updatable.

  If a view is not updatable, statements such
  [`UPDATE`](update.md "15.2.17 UPDATE Statement"),
  [`DELETE`](delete.md "15.2.2 DELETE Statement"), and
  [`INSERT`](insert.md "15.2.7 INSERT Statement") are illegal and are
  rejected. (Even if a view is updatable, it might not be
  possible to insert into it; for details, refer to
  [Section 27.5.3, “Updatable and Insertable Views”](view-updatability.md "27.5.3 Updatable and Insertable Views").)
- `DEFINER`

  The account of the user who created the view, in
  `'user_name'@'host_name'`
  format.
- `SECURITY_TYPE`

  The view `SQL SECURITY` characteristic. The
  value is one of `DEFINER` or
  `INVOKER`.
- `CHARACTER_SET_CLIENT`

  The session value of the
  [`character_set_client`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_character_set_client) system
  variable when the view was created.
- `COLLATION_CONNECTION`

  The session value of the
  [`collation_connection`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_collation_connection) system
  variable when the view was created.

#### Notes

MySQL permits different [`sql_mode`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_sql_mode)
settings to tell the server the type of SQL syntax to support. For
example, you might use the [`ANSI`](sql-mode.md#sqlmode_ansi)
SQL mode to ensure MySQL correctly interprets the standard SQL
concatenation operator, the double bar (`||`), in
your queries. If you then create a view that concatenates items,
you might worry that changing the
[`sql_mode`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_sql_mode) setting to a value
different from [`ANSI`](sql-mode.md#sqlmode_ansi) could cause
the view to become invalid. But this is not the case. No matter
how you write out a view definition, MySQL always stores it the
same way, in a canonical form. Here is an example that shows how
the server changes a double bar concatenation operator to a
[`CONCAT()`](string-functions.md#function_concat) function:

```sql
mysql> SET sql_mode = 'ANSI';
Query OK, 0 rows affected (0.00 sec)

mysql> CREATE VIEW test.v AS SELECT 'a' || 'b' as col1;
Query OK, 0 rows affected (0.00 sec)

mysql> SELECT VIEW_DEFINITION FROM INFORMATION_SCHEMA.VIEWS
       WHERE TABLE_SCHEMA = 'test' AND TABLE_NAME = 'v';
+----------------------------------+
| VIEW_DEFINITION                  |
+----------------------------------+
| select concat('a','b') AS `col1` |
+----------------------------------+
1 row in set (0.00 sec)
```

The advantage of storing a view definition in canonical form is
that changes made later to the value of
[`sql_mode`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_sql_mode) do not affect the
results from the view. However, an additional consequence is that
comments prior to [`SELECT`](select.md "15.2.13 SELECT Statement") are
stripped from the definition by the server.
