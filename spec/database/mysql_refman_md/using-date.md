#### B.3.4.2 Problems Using DATE Columns

The format of a [`DATE`](datetime.md "13.2.2 The DATE, DATETIME, and TIMESTAMP Types") value is
`'YYYY-MM-DD'`.
According to standard SQL, no other format is permitted. You
should use this format in
[`UPDATE`](update.md "15.2.17 UPDATE Statement") expressions and in the
`WHERE` clause of
[`SELECT`](select.md "15.2.13 SELECT Statement") statements. For example:

```sql
SELECT * FROM t1 WHERE date >= '2003-05-05';
```

As a convenience, MySQL automatically converts a date to a
number if the date is used in numeric context and vice versa.
MySQL also permits a “relaxed” string format when
updating and in a `WHERE` clause that
compares a date to a [`DATE`](datetime.md "13.2.2 The DATE, DATETIME, and TIMESTAMP Types"),
[`DATETIME`](datetime.md "13.2.2 The DATE, DATETIME, and TIMESTAMP Types"), or
[`TIMESTAMP`](datetime.md "13.2.2 The DATE, DATETIME, and TIMESTAMP Types") column.
“Relaxed” format means that any punctuation
character may be used as the separator between parts. For
example, `'2004-08-15'` and
`'2004#08#15'` are equivalent. MySQL can also
convert a string containing no separators (such as
`'20040815'`), provided it makes sense as a
date.

When you compare a [`DATE`](datetime.md "13.2.2 The DATE, DATETIME, and TIMESTAMP Types"),
[`TIME`](time.md "13.2.3 The TIME Type"),
[`DATETIME`](datetime.md "13.2.2 The DATE, DATETIME, and TIMESTAMP Types"), or
[`TIMESTAMP`](datetime.md "13.2.2 The DATE, DATETIME, and TIMESTAMP Types") to a constant string
with the `<`, `<=`,
`=`, `>=`,
`>`, or `BETWEEN`
operators, MySQL normally converts the string to an internal
long integer for faster comparison (and also for a bit more
“relaxed” string checking). However, this
conversion is subject to the following exceptions:

- When you compare two columns
- When you compare a [`DATE`](datetime.md "13.2.2 The DATE, DATETIME, and TIMESTAMP Types"),
  [`TIME`](time.md "13.2.3 The TIME Type"),
  [`DATETIME`](datetime.md "13.2.2 The DATE, DATETIME, and TIMESTAMP Types"), or
  [`TIMESTAMP`](datetime.md "13.2.2 The DATE, DATETIME, and TIMESTAMP Types") column to an
  expression
- When you use any comparison method other than those just
  listed, such as `IN` or
  [`STRCMP()`](string-comparison-functions.md#function_strcmp).

For those exceptions, the comparison is done by converting the
objects to strings and performing a string comparison.

To be on the safe side, assume that strings are compared as
strings and use the appropriate string functions if you want
to compare a temporal value to a string.

The special “zero” date
`'0000-00-00'` can be stored and retrieved as
`'0000-00-00'.` When a
`'0000-00-00'` date is used through
Connector/ODBC, it is automatically converted to
`NULL` because ODBC cannot handle that kind
of date.

Because MySQL performs the conversions just described, the
following statements work (assume that
`idate` is a
[`DATE`](datetime.md "13.2.2 The DATE, DATETIME, and TIMESTAMP Types") column):

```sql
INSERT INTO t1 (idate) VALUES (19970505);
INSERT INTO t1 (idate) VALUES ('19970505');
INSERT INTO t1 (idate) VALUES ('97-05-05');
INSERT INTO t1 (idate) VALUES ('1997.05.05');
INSERT INTO t1 (idate) VALUES ('1997 05 05');
INSERT INTO t1 (idate) VALUES ('0000-00-00');

SELECT idate FROM t1 WHERE idate >= '1997-05-05';
SELECT idate FROM t1 WHERE idate >= 19970505;
SELECT MOD(idate,100) FROM t1 WHERE idate >= 19970505;
SELECT idate FROM t1 WHERE idate >= '19970505';
```

However, the following statement does not work:

```sql
SELECT idate FROM t1 WHERE STRCMP(idate,'20030505')=0;
```

[`STRCMP()`](string-comparison-functions.md#function_strcmp) is a string function,
so it converts `idate` to a string in
`'YYYY-MM-DD'`
format and performs a string comparison. It does not convert
`'20030505'` to the date
`'2003-05-05'` and perform a date comparison.

If you enable the
[`ALLOW_INVALID_DATES`](sql-mode.md#sqlmode_allow_invalid_dates) SQL
mode, MySQL permits you to store dates that are given only
limited checking: MySQL requires only that the day is in the
range from 1 to 31 and the month is in the range from 1 to 12.
This makes MySQL very convenient for Web applications where
you obtain year, month, and day in three different fields and
you want to store exactly what the user inserted (without date
validation).

MySQL permits you to store dates where the day or month and
day are zero. This is convenient if you want to store a
birthdate in a [`DATE`](datetime.md "13.2.2 The DATE, DATETIME, and TIMESTAMP Types") column and
you know only part of the date. To disallow zero month or day
parts in dates, enable the
[`NO_ZERO_IN_DATE`](sql-mode.md#sqlmode_no_zero_in_date) mode.

MySQL permits you to store a “zero” value of
`'0000-00-00'` as a “dummy
date.” This is in some cases more convenient than using
`NULL` values. If a date to be stored in a
[`DATE`](datetime.md "13.2.2 The DATE, DATETIME, and TIMESTAMP Types") column cannot be converted
to any reasonable value, MySQL stores
`'0000-00-00'`. To disallow
`'0000-00-00'`, enable the
[`NO_ZERO_DATE`](sql-mode.md#sqlmode_no_zero_date) mode.

To have MySQL check all dates and accept only legal dates
(unless overridden by `IGNORE`), set the
[`sql_mode`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_sql_mode) system variable to
`"NO_ZERO_IN_DATE,NO_ZERO_DATE"`.
