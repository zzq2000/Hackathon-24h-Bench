#### 25.2.7.6 Unsupported or Missing Features in NDB Cluster

A number of features supported by other storage engines are not
supported for [`NDB`](mysql-cluster.md "Chapter 25 MySQL NDB Cluster 8.0") tables. Trying to
use any of these features in NDB Cluster does not cause errors
in or of itself; however, errors may occur in applications that
expects the features to be supported or enforced. Statements
referencing such features, even if effectively ignored by
`NDB`, must be syntactically and otherwise
valid.

- **Index prefixes.**
  Prefixes on indexes are not supported for
  `NDB` tables. If a prefix is used as part
  of an index specification in a statement such as
  [`CREATE TABLE`](create-table.md "15.1.20 CREATE TABLE Statement"),
  [`ALTER TABLE`](alter-table.md "15.1.9 ALTER TABLE Statement"), or
  [`CREATE INDEX`](create-index.md "15.1.15 CREATE INDEX Statement"), the prefix is
  not created by `NDB`.

  A statement containing an index prefix, and creating or
  modifying an `NDB` table, must still be
  syntactically valid. For example, the following statement
  always fails with Error 1089 Incorrect prefix
  key; the used key part is not a string, the used length is
  longer than the key part, or the storage engine doesn't
  support unique prefix keys, regardless of
  storage engine:

  ```sql
  CREATE TABLE t1 (
      c1 INT NOT NULL,
      c2 VARCHAR(100),
      INDEX i1 (c2(500))
  );
  ```

  This happens on account of the SQL syntax rule that no index
  may have a prefix larger than itself.
- **Savepoints and rollbacks.**
  Savepoints and rollbacks to savepoints are ignored as in
  [`MyISAM`](myisam-storage-engine.md "18.2 The MyISAM Storage Engine").
- **Durability of commits.**
  There are no durable commits on disk. Commits are
  replicated, but there is no guarantee that logs are
  flushed to disk on commit.
- **Replication.**
  Statement-based replication is not supported. Use
  [`--binlog-format=ROW`](replication-options-binary-log.md#sysvar_binlog_format) (or
  [`--binlog-format=MIXED`](replication-options-binary-log.md#sysvar_binlog_format)) when
  setting up cluster replication. See
  [Section 25.7, “NDB Cluster Replication”](mysql-cluster-replication.md "25.7 NDB Cluster Replication"), for more
  information.

  Replication using global transaction identifiers (GTIDs) is
  not compatible with NDB Cluster, and is not supported in NDB
  Cluster 8.0. Do not enable GTIDs when using the
  `NDB` storage engine, as this is very
  likely to cause problems up to and including failure of NDB
  Cluster Replication.

  Semisynchronous replication is not supported in NDB Cluster.
- **Generated columns.**
  The `NDB` storage engine does not support
  indexes on virtual generated columns.

  As with other storage engines, you can create an index on a
  stored generated column, but you should bear in mind that
  `NDB` uses
  [`DataMemory`](mysql-cluster-ndbd-definition.md#ndbparam-ndbd-datamemory) for
  storage of the generated column as well as
  [`IndexMemory`](mysql-cluster-ndbd-definition.md#ndbparam-ndbd-indexmemory) for the
  index. See
  [JSON columns and indirect indexing in NDB Cluster](create-table-secondary-indexes.md#json-column-indirect-index-mysql-cluster "JSON columns and indirect indexing in NDB Cluster"),
  for an example.

  NDB Cluster writes changes in stored generated columns to
  the binary log, but does log not those made to virtual
  columns. This should not effect NDB Cluster Replication or
  replication between `NDB` and other MySQL
  storage engines.
