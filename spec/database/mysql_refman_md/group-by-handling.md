### 14.19.3 MySQL Handling of GROUP BY

SQL-92 and earlier does not permit queries for which the select
list, `HAVING` condition, or `ORDER
BY` list refer to nonaggregated columns that are not
named in the `GROUP BY` clause. For example,
this query is illegal in standard SQL-92 because the
nonaggregated `name` column in the select list
does not appear in the `GROUP BY`:

```sql
SELECT o.custid, c.name, MAX(o.payment)
  FROM orders AS o, customers AS c
  WHERE o.custid = c.custid
  GROUP BY o.custid;
```

For the query to be legal in SQL-92, the `name`
column must be omitted from the select list or named in the
`GROUP BY` clause.

SQL:1999 and later permits such nonaggregates per optional
feature T301 if they are functionally dependent on
`GROUP BY` columns: If such a relationship
exists between `name` and
`custid`, the query is legal. This would be the
case, for example, were `custid` a primary key
of `customers`.

MySQL implements detection of functional dependence. If the
[`ONLY_FULL_GROUP_BY`](sql-mode.md#sqlmode_only_full_group_by) SQL mode is
enabled (which it is by default), MySQL rejects queries for
which the select list, `HAVING` condition, or
`ORDER BY` list refer to nonaggregated columns
that are neither named in the `GROUP BY` clause
nor are functionally dependent on them.

MySQL also permits a nonaggregate column not named in a
`GROUP BY` clause when SQL
[`ONLY_FULL_GROUP_BY`](sql-mode.md#sqlmode_only_full_group_by) mode is
enabled, provided that this column is limited to a single value,
as shown in the following example:

```sql
mysql> CREATE TABLE mytable (
    ->    id INT UNSIGNED NOT NULL PRIMARY KEY,
    ->    a VARCHAR(10),
    ->    b INT
    -> );

mysql> INSERT INTO mytable
    -> VALUES (1, 'abc', 1000),
    ->        (2, 'abc', 2000),
    ->        (3, 'def', 4000);

mysql> SET SESSION sql_mode = sys.list_add(@@session.sql_mode, 'ONLY_FULL_GROUP_BY');

mysql> SELECT a, SUM(b) FROM mytable WHERE a = 'abc';
+------+--------+
| a    | SUM(b) |
+------+--------+
| abc  |   3000 |
+------+--------+
```

It is also possible to have more than one nonaggregate column in
the [`SELECT`](select.md "15.2.13 SELECT Statement") list when employing
[`ONLY_FULL_GROUP_BY`](sql-mode.md#sqlmode_only_full_group_by). In this
case, every such column must be limited to a single value in the
`WHERE` clause, and all such limiting
conditions must be joined by logical `AND`, as
shown here:

```sql
mysql> DROP TABLE IF EXISTS mytable;

mysql> CREATE TABLE mytable (
    ->    id INT UNSIGNED NOT NULL PRIMARY KEY,
    ->    a VARCHAR(10),
    ->    b VARCHAR(10),
    ->    c INT
    -> );

mysql> INSERT INTO mytable
    -> VALUES (1, 'abc', 'qrs', 1000),
    ->        (2, 'abc', 'tuv', 2000),
    ->        (3, 'def', 'qrs', 4000),
    ->        (4, 'def', 'tuv', 8000),
    ->        (5, 'abc', 'qrs', 16000),
    ->        (6, 'def', 'tuv', 32000);

mysql> SELECT @@session.sql_mode;
+---------------------------------------------------------------+
| @@session.sql_mode                                            |
+---------------------------------------------------------------+
| ONLY_FULL_GROUP_BY,STRICT_TRANS_TABLES,NO_ENGINE_SUBSTITUTION |
+---------------------------------------------------------------+

mysql> SELECT a, b, SUM(c) FROM mytable
    ->     WHERE a = 'abc' AND b = 'qrs';
+------+------+--------+
| a    | b    | SUM(c) |
+------+------+--------+
| abc  | qrs  |  17000 |
+------+------+--------+
```

If [`ONLY_FULL_GROUP_BY`](sql-mode.md#sqlmode_only_full_group_by) is
disabled, a MySQL extension to the standard SQL use of
`GROUP BY` permits the select list,
`HAVING` condition, or `ORDER
BY` list to refer to nonaggregated columns even if the
columns are not functionally dependent on `GROUP
BY` columns. This causes MySQL to accept the preceding
query. In this case, the server is free to choose any value from
each group, so unless they are the same, the values chosen are
nondeterministic, which is probably not what you want.
Furthermore, the selection of values from each group cannot be
influenced by adding an `ORDER BY` clause.
Result set sorting occurs after values have been chosen, and
`ORDER BY` does not affect which value within
each group the server chooses. Disabling
[`ONLY_FULL_GROUP_BY`](sql-mode.md#sqlmode_only_full_group_by) is useful
primarily when you know that, due to some property of the data,
all values in each nonaggregated column not named in the
`GROUP BY` are the same for each group.

You can achieve the same effect without disabling
[`ONLY_FULL_GROUP_BY`](sql-mode.md#sqlmode_only_full_group_by) by using
[`ANY_VALUE()`](miscellaneous-functions.md#function_any-value) to refer to the
nonaggregated column.

The following discussion demonstrates functional dependence, the
error message MySQL produces when functional dependence is
absent, and ways of causing MySQL to accept a query in the
absence of functional dependence.

This query might be invalid with
[`ONLY_FULL_GROUP_BY`](sql-mode.md#sqlmode_only_full_group_by) enabled
because the nonaggregated `address` column in
the select list is not named in the `GROUP BY`
clause:

```sql
SELECT name, address, MAX(age) FROM t GROUP BY name;
```

The query is valid if `name` is a primary key
of `t` or is a unique `NOT
NULL` column. In such cases, MySQL recognizes that the
selected column is functionally dependent on a grouping column.
For example, if `name` is a primary key, its
value determines the value of `address` because
each group has only one value of the primary key and thus only
one row. As a result, there is no randomness in the choice of
`address` value in a group and no need to
reject the query.

The query is invalid if `name` is not a primary
key of `t` or a unique `NOT
NULL` column. In this case, no functional dependency
can be inferred and an error occurs:

```sql
mysql> SELECT name, address, MAX(age) FROM t GROUP BY name;
ERROR 1055 (42000): Expression #2 of SELECT list is not in GROUP
BY clause and contains nonaggregated column 'mydb.t.address' which
is not functionally dependent on columns in GROUP BY clause; this
is incompatible with sql_mode=only_full_group_by
```

If you know that, *for a given data set,*
each `name` value in fact uniquely determines
the `address` value, `address`
is effectively functionally dependent on
`name`. To tell MySQL to accept the query, you
can use the [`ANY_VALUE()`](miscellaneous-functions.md#function_any-value) function:

```sql
SELECT name, ANY_VALUE(address), MAX(age) FROM t GROUP BY name;
```

Alternatively, disable
[`ONLY_FULL_GROUP_BY`](sql-mode.md#sqlmode_only_full_group_by).

The preceding example is quite simple, however. In particular,
it is unlikely you would group on a single primary key column
because every group would contain only one row. For additional
examples demonstrating functional dependence in more complex
queries, see [Section 14.19.4, “Detection of Functional Dependence”](group-by-functional-dependence.md "14.19.4 Detection of Functional Dependence").

If a query has aggregate functions and no `GROUP
BY` clause, it cannot have nonaggregated columns in the
select list, `HAVING` condition, or
`ORDER BY` list with
[`ONLY_FULL_GROUP_BY`](sql-mode.md#sqlmode_only_full_group_by) enabled:

```sql
mysql> SELECT name, MAX(age) FROM t;
ERROR 1140 (42000): In aggregated query without GROUP BY, expression
#1 of SELECT list contains nonaggregated column 'mydb.t.name'; this
is incompatible with sql_mode=only_full_group_by
```

Without `GROUP BY`, there is a single group and
it is nondeterministic which `name` value to
choose for the group. Here, too,
[`ANY_VALUE()`](miscellaneous-functions.md#function_any-value) can be used, if it is
immaterial which `name` value MySQL chooses:

```sql
SELECT ANY_VALUE(name), MAX(age) FROM t;
```

`ONLY_FULL_GROUP_BY` also affects handling of
queries that use `DISTINCT` and `ORDER
BY`. Consider the case of a table `t`
with three columns `c1`, `c2`,
and `c3` that contains these rows:

```none
c1 c2 c3
1  2  A
3  4  B
1  2  C
```

Suppose that we execute the following query, expecting the
results to be ordered by `c3`:

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT c1, c2 FROM t ORDER BY c3;
```

To order the result, duplicates must be eliminated first. But to
do so, should we keep the first row or the third? This arbitrary
choice influences the retained value of `c3`,
which in turn influences ordering and makes it arbitrary as
well. To prevent this problem, a query that has
`DISTINCT` and `ORDER BY` is
rejected as invalid if any `ORDER BY`
expression does not satisfy at least one of these conditions:

- The expression is equal to one in the select list
- All columns referenced by the expression and belonging to
  the query's selected tables are elements of the select list

Another MySQL extension to standard SQL permits references in
the `HAVING` clause to aliased expressions in
the select list. For example, the following query returns
`name` values that occur only once in table
`orders`:

```sql
SELECT name, COUNT(name) FROM orders
  GROUP BY name
  HAVING COUNT(name) = 1;
```

The MySQL extension permits the use of an alias in the
`HAVING` clause for the aggregated column:

```sql
SELECT name, COUNT(name) AS c FROM orders
  GROUP BY name
  HAVING c = 1;
```

Standard SQL permits only column expressions in `GROUP
BY` clauses, so a statement such as this is invalid
because `FLOOR(value/100)` is a noncolumn
expression:

```sql
SELECT id, FLOOR(value/100)
  FROM tbl_name
  GROUP BY id, FLOOR(value/100);
```

MySQL extends standard SQL to permit noncolumn expressions in
`GROUP BY` clauses and considers the preceding
statement valid.

Standard SQL also does not permit aliases in `GROUP
BY` clauses. MySQL extends standard SQL to permit
aliases, so another way to write the query is as follows:

```sql
SELECT id, FLOOR(value/100) AS val
  FROM tbl_name
  GROUP BY id, val;
```

The alias `val` is considered a column
expression in the `GROUP BY` clause.

In the presence of a noncolumn expression in the `GROUP
BY` clause, MySQL recognizes equality between that
expression and expressions in the select list. This means that
with [`ONLY_FULL_GROUP_BY`](sql-mode.md#sqlmode_only_full_group_by) SQL
mode enabled, the query containing `GROUP BY id,
FLOOR(value/100)` is valid because that same
[`FLOOR()`](mathematical-functions.md#function_floor) expression occurs in the
select list. However, MySQL does not try to recognize functional
dependence on `GROUP BY` noncolumn expressions,
so the following query is invalid with
[`ONLY_FULL_GROUP_BY`](sql-mode.md#sqlmode_only_full_group_by) enabled,
even though the third selected expression is a simple formula of
the `id` column and the
[`FLOOR()`](mathematical-functions.md#function_floor) expression in the
`GROUP BY` clause:

```sql
SELECT id, FLOOR(value/100), id+FLOOR(value/100)
  FROM tbl_name
  GROUP BY id, FLOOR(value/100);
```

A workaround is to use a derived table:

```sql
SELECT id, F, id+F
  FROM
    (SELECT id, FLOOR(value/100) AS F
     FROM tbl_name
     GROUP BY id, FLOOR(value/100)) AS dt;
```
