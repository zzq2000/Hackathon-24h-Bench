### 17.17.3 InnoDB Standard Monitor and Lock Monitor Output

The Lock Monitor is the same as the Standard Monitor except that
it includes additional lock information. Enabling either monitor
for periodic output turns on the same output stream, but the
stream includes extra information if the Lock Monitor is enabled.
For example, if you enable the Standard Monitor and Lock Monitor,
that turns on a single output stream. The stream includes extra
lock information until you disable the Lock Monitor.

Standard Monitor output is limited to 1MB when produced using the
[`SHOW ENGINE INNODB
STATUS`](show-engine.md "15.7.7.15 SHOW ENGINE Statement") statement. This limit does not apply to output
written to server standard error output
(`stderr`).

Example Standard Monitor output:

END OF INNODB MONITOR OUTPUT
============================
```

#### Standard Monitor Output Sections

For a description of each metric reported by the Standard
Monitor, refer to the
[Metrics](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/mysql-em-plugin/en/myoem-metrics.html)
chapter in the
[Oracle
Enterprise Manager for MySQL Database User's Guide](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/mysql-em-plugin/en/).

- `Status`

  This section shows the timestamp, the monitor name, and the
  number of seconds that per-second averages are based on. The
  number of seconds is the elapsed time between the current
  time and the last time `InnoDB` Monitor
  output was printed.
- `BACKGROUND THREAD`

  The `srv_master_thread` lines shows work
  done by the main background thread.
- `SEMAPHORES`

  This section reports threads waiting for a semaphore and
  statistics on how many times threads have needed a spin or a
  wait on a mutex or a rw-lock semaphore. A large number of
  threads waiting for semaphores may be a result of disk I/O,
  or contention problems inside `InnoDB`.
  Contention can be due to heavy parallelism of queries or
  problems in operating system thread scheduling. Setting the
  [`innodb_thread_concurrency`](innodb-parameters.md#sysvar_innodb_thread_concurrency)
  system variable smaller than the default value might help in
  such situations. The `Spin rounds per wait`
  line shows the number of spinlock rounds per OS wait for a
  mutex.

  Mutex metrics are reported by
  [`SHOW ENGINE
  INNODB MUTEX`](show-engine.md "15.7.7.15 SHOW ENGINE Statement").
- `LATEST FOREIGN KEY ERROR`

  This section provides information about the most recent
  foreign key constraint error. It is not present if no such
  error has occurred. The contents include the statement that
  failed as well as information about the constraint that
  failed and the referenced and referencing tables.
- `LATEST DETECTED DEADLOCK`

  This section provides information about the most recent
  deadlock. It is not present if no deadlock has occurred. The
  contents show which transactions are involved, the statement
  each was attempting to execute, the locks they have and
  need, and which transaction `InnoDB`
  decided to roll back to break the deadlock. The lock modes
  reported in this section are explained in
  [Section 17.7.1, “InnoDB Locking”](innodb-locking.md "17.7.1 InnoDB Locking").
- `TRANSACTIONS`

  If this section reports lock waits, your applications might
  have lock contention. The output can also help to trace the
  reasons for transaction deadlocks.
- `FILE I/O`

  This section provides information about threads that
  `InnoDB` uses to perform various types of
  I/O. The first few of these are dedicated to general
  `InnoDB` processing. The contents also
  display information for pending I/O operations and
  statistics for I/O performance.

  The number of these threads are controlled by the
  [`innodb_read_io_threads`](innodb-parameters.md#sysvar_innodb_read_io_threads) and
  [`innodb_write_io_threads`](innodb-parameters.md#sysvar_innodb_write_io_threads)
  parameters. See [Section 17.14, “InnoDB Startup Options and System Variables”](innodb-parameters.md "17.14 InnoDB Startup Options and System Variables").
- `INSERT BUFFER AND ADAPTIVE HASH INDEX`

  This section shows the status of the
  `InnoDB` insert buffer (also referred to as
  the [change buffer](glossary.md#glos_change_buffer "change buffer"))
  and the adaptive hash index.

  For related information, see
  [Section 17.5.2, “Change Buffer”](innodb-change-buffer.md "17.5.2 Change Buffer"), and
  [Section 17.5.3, “Adaptive Hash Index”](innodb-adaptive-hash.md "17.5.3 Adaptive Hash Index").
- `LOG`

  This section displays information about the
  `InnoDB` log. The contents include the
  current log sequence number, how far the log has been
  flushed to disk, and the position at which
  `InnoDB` last took a checkpoint. (See
  [Section 17.11.3, “InnoDB Checkpoints”](innodb-checkpoints.md "17.11.3 InnoDB Checkpoints").) The section also
  displays information about pending writes and write
  performance statistics.
- `BUFFER POOL AND MEMORY`

  This section gives you statistics on pages read and written.
  You can calculate from these numbers how many data file I/O
  operations your queries currently are doing.

  For buffer pool statistics descriptions, see
  [Monitoring the Buffer Pool Using the InnoDB Standard Monitor](innodb-buffer-pool.md#innodb-buffer-pool-monitoring "Monitoring the Buffer Pool Using the InnoDB Standard Monitor"). For
  additional information about the operation of the buffer
  pool, see [Section 17.5.1, “Buffer Pool”](innodb-buffer-pool.md "17.5.1 Buffer Pool").
- `ROW OPERATIONS`

  This section shows what the main thread is doing, including
  the number and performance rate for each type of row
  operation.
