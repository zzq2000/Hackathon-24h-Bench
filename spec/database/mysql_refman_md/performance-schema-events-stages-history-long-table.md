#### 29.12.5.3 The events\_stages\_history\_long Table

The [`events_stages_history_long`](performance-schema-events-stages-history-long-table.md "29.12.5.3 The events_stages_history_long Table")
table contains the *`N`* most recent
stage events that have ended globally, across all threads.
Stage events are not added to the table until they have ended.
When the table becomes full, the oldest row is discarded when
a new row is added, regardless of which thread generated
either row.

The Performance Schema autosizes the value of
*`N`* during server startup. To set the
table size explicitly, set the
[`performance_schema_events_stages_history_long_size`](performance-schema-system-variables.md#sysvar_performance_schema_events_stages_history_long_size)
system variable at server startup.

The [`events_stages_history_long`](performance-schema-events-stages-history-long-table.md "29.12.5.3 The events_stages_history_long Table")
table has the same columns as
[`events_stages_current`](performance-schema-events-stages-current-table.md "29.12.5.1 The events_stages_current Table"). See
[Section 29.12.5.1, “The events\_stages\_current Table”](performance-schema-events-stages-current-table.md "29.12.5.1 The events_stages_current Table").
Unlike [`events_stages_current`](performance-schema-events-stages-current-table.md "29.12.5.1 The events_stages_current Table"),
[`events_stages_history_long`](performance-schema-events-stages-history-long-table.md "29.12.5.3 The events_stages_history_long Table") has no
indexing.

[`TRUNCATE TABLE`](truncate-table.md "15.1.37 TRUNCATE TABLE Statement") is permitted for
the [`events_stages_history_long`](performance-schema-events-stages-history-long-table.md "29.12.5.3 The events_stages_history_long Table")
table. It removes the rows.

For more information about the relationship between the three
stage event tables, see
[Section 29.9, “Performance Schema Tables for Current and Historical Events”](performance-schema-event-tables.md "29.9 Performance Schema Tables for Current and Historical Events").

For information about configuring whether to collect stage
events, see [Section 29.12.5, “Performance Schema Stage Event Tables”](performance-schema-stage-tables.md "29.12.5 Performance Schema Stage Event Tables").
