### 8.1.6 Security Considerations for LOAD DATA LOCAL

The [`LOAD DATA`](load-data.md "15.2.9 LOAD DATA Statement") statement loads a
data file into a table. The statement can load a file located on
the server host, or, if the `LOCAL` keyword is
specified, on the client host.

The `LOCAL` version of [`LOAD
DATA`](load-data.md "15.2.9 LOAD DATA Statement") has two potential security issues:

- Because [`LOAD DATA
  LOCAL`](load-data.md "15.2.9 LOAD DATA Statement") is an SQL statement, parsing occurs on the
  server side, and transfer of the file from the client host to
  the server host is initiated by the MySQL server, which tells
  the client the file named in the statement. In theory, a
  patched server could tell the client program to transfer a
  file of the server's choosing rather than the file named in
  the statement. Such a server could access any file on the
  client host to which the client user has read access. (A
  patched server could in fact reply with a file-transfer
  request to any statement, not just
  [`LOAD DATA
  LOCAL`](load-data.md "15.2.9 LOAD DATA Statement"), so a more fundamental issue is that clients
  should not connect to untrusted servers.)
- In a Web environment where the clients are connecting from a
  Web server, a user could use
  [`LOAD DATA
  LOCAL`](load-data.md "15.2.9 LOAD DATA Statement") to read any files that the Web server process
  has read access to (assuming that a user could run any
  statement against the SQL server). In this environment, the
  client with respect to the MySQL server actually is the Web
  server, not a remote program being run by users who connect to
  the Web server.

To avoid connecting to untrusted servers, clients can establish a
secure connection and verify the server identity by connecting
using the
[`--ssl-mode=VERIFY_IDENTITY`](connection-options.md#option_general_ssl-mode) option
and the appropriate CA certificate. To implement this level of
verification, you must first ensure that the CA certificate for
the server is reliably available to the replica, otherwise
availability issues will result. For more information, see
[Command Options for Encrypted Connections](connection-options.md#encrypted-connection-options "Command Options for Encrypted Connections").

To avoid [`LOAD DATA`](load-data.md "15.2.9 LOAD DATA Statement") issues, clients
should avoid using `LOCAL` unless proper
client-side precautions have been taken.

For control over local data loading, MySQL permits the capability
to be enabled or disabled. In addition, as of MySQL 8.0.21, MySQL
enables clients to restrict local data loading operations to files
located in a designated directory.

- [Enabling or Disabling Local Data Loading Capability](load-data-local-security.md#load-data-local-configuration "Enabling or Disabling Local Data Loading Capability")
- [Restricting Files Permitted for Local Data Loading](load-data-local-security.md#load-data-local-permitted-files "Restricting Files Permitted for Local Data Loading")
- [MySQL Shell and Local Data Loading](load-data-local-security.md#load-data-local-shell "MySQL Shell and Local Data Loading")

#### Enabling or Disabling Local Data Loading Capability

Administrators and applications can configure whether to permit
local data loading as follows:

- On the server side:

  - The [`local_infile`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_local_infile) system
    variable controls server-side `LOCAL`
    capability. Depending on the
    [`local_infile`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_local_infile) setting,
    the server refuses or permits local data loading by
    clients that request local data loading.
  - By default,
    [`local_infile`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_local_infile) is
    disabled. (This is a change from previous versions of
    MySQL.) To cause the server to refuse or permit
    [`LOAD DATA
    LOCAL`](load-data.md "15.2.9 LOAD DATA Statement") statements explicitly (regardless of how
    client programs and libraries are configured at build
    time or runtime), start [**mysqld**](mysqld.md "6.3.1 mysqld — The MySQL Server") with
    [`local_infile`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_local_infile) disabled
    or enabled.
    [`local_infile`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_local_infile) can also
    be set at runtime.
- On the client side:

  - The [`ENABLED_LOCAL_INFILE`](source-configuration-options.md#option_cmake_enabled_local_infile)
    **CMake** option controls the compiled-in
    default `LOCAL` capability for the
    MySQL client library (see
    [Section 2.8.7, “MySQL Source-Configuration Options”](source-configuration-options.md "2.8.7 MySQL Source-Configuration Options")). Clients
    that make no explicit arrangements therefore have
    `LOCAL` capability disabled or enabled
    according to the
    [`ENABLED_LOCAL_INFILE`](source-configuration-options.md#option_cmake_enabled_local_infile)
    setting specified at MySQL build time.
  - By default, the client library in MySQL binary
    distributions is compiled with
    [`ENABLED_LOCAL_INFILE`](source-configuration-options.md#option_cmake_enabled_local_infile)
    disabled. If you compile MySQL from source, configure it
    with [`ENABLED_LOCAL_INFILE`](source-configuration-options.md#option_cmake_enabled_local_infile)
    disabled or enabled based on whether clients that make
    no explicit arrangements should have
    `LOCAL` capability disabled or enabled.
  - For client programs that use the C API, local data
    loading capability is determined by the default compiled
    into the MySQL client library. To enable or disable it
    explicitly, invoke the
    [`mysql_options()`](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/c-api/8.0/en/mysql-options.html) C API
    function to disable or enable the
    `MYSQL_OPT_LOCAL_INFILE` option. See
    [mysql\_options()](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/c-api/8.0/en/mysql-options.html).
  - For the [**mysql**](mysql.md "6.5.1 mysql — The MySQL Command-Line Client") client, local data
    loading capability is determined by the default compiled
    into the MySQL client library. To disable or enable it
    explicitly, use the
    [`--local-infile=0`](mysql-command-options.md#option_mysql_local-infile) or
    [`--local-infile[=1]`](mysql-command-options.md#option_mysql_local-infile) option.
  - For the [**mysqlimport**](mysqlimport.md "6.5.5 mysqlimport — A Data Import Program") client, local
    data loading is not used by default. To disable or
    enable it explicitly, use the
    [`--local=0`](mysqlimport.md#option_mysqlimport_local) or
    [`--local[=1]`](mysqlimport.md#option_mysqlimport_local) option.
  - If you use
    [`LOAD DATA
    LOCAL`](load-data.md "15.2.9 LOAD DATA Statement") in Perl scripts or other programs that
    read the `[client]` group from option
    files, you can add a `local-infile`
    option setting to that group. To prevent problems for
    programs that do not understand this option, specify it
    using the
    [`loose-`](option-modifiers.md "6.2.2.4 Program Option Modifiers")
    prefix:

    ```ini
    [client]
    loose-local-infile=0
    ```

    or:

    ```ini
    [client]
    loose-local-infile=1
    ```
  - In all cases, successful use of a
    `LOCAL` load operation by a client also
    requires that the server permits local loading.

If `LOCAL` capability is disabled, on either
the server or client side, a client that attempts to issue a
[`LOAD DATA
LOCAL`](load-data.md "15.2.9 LOAD DATA Statement") statement receives the following error message:

```none
ERROR 3950 (42000): Loading local data is disabled; this must be
enabled on both the client and server side
```

#### Restricting Files Permitted for Local Data Loading

As of MySQL 8.0.21, the MySQL client library enables client
applications to restrict local data loading operations to files
located in a designated directory. Certain MySQL client programs
take advantage of this capability.

Client programs that use the C API can control which files to
permit for load data loading using the
`MYSQL_OPT_LOCAL_INFILE` and
`MYSQL_OPT_LOAD_DATA_LOCAL_DIR` options of the
[`mysql_options()`](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/c-api/8.0/en/mysql-options.html) C API function
(see [mysql\_options()](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/c-api/8.0/en/mysql-options.html)).

The effect of `MYSQL_OPT_LOAD_DATA_LOCAL_DIR`
depends on whether `LOCAL` data loading is
enabled or disabled:

- If `LOCAL` data loading is enabled, either
  by default in the MySQL client library or by explicitly
  enabling `MYSQL_OPT_LOCAL_INFILE`, the
  `MYSQL_OPT_LOAD_DATA_LOCAL_DIR` option has
  no effect.
- If `LOCAL` data loading is disabled, either
  by default in the MySQL client library or by explicitly
  disabling `MYSQL_OPT_LOCAL_INFILE`, the
  `MYSQL_OPT_LOAD_DATA_LOCAL_DIR` option can
  be used to designate a permitted directory for locally
  loaded files. In this case, `LOCAL` data
  loading is permitted but restricted to files located in the
  designated directory. Interpretation of the
  `MYSQL_OPT_LOAD_DATA_LOCAL_DIR` value is as
  follows:

  - If the value is the null pointer (the default), it names
    no directory, with the result that no files are
    permitted for `LOCAL` data loading.
  - If the value is a directory path name,
    `LOCAL` data loading is permitted but
    restricted to files located in the named directory.
    Comparison of the directory path name and the path name
    of files to be loaded is case-sensitive regardless of
    the case sensitivity of the underlying file system.

MySQL client programs use the preceding
[`mysql_options()`](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/c-api/8.0/en/mysql-options.html) options as
follows:

- The [**mysql**](mysql.md "6.5.1 mysql — The MySQL Command-Line Client") client has a
  [`--load-data-local-dir`](mysql-command-options.md#option_mysql_load-data-local-dir) option
  that takes a directory path or an empty string.
  [**mysql**](mysql.md "6.5.1 mysql — The MySQL Command-Line Client") uses the option value to set the
  `MYSQL_OPT_LOAD_DATA_LOCAL_DIR` option
  (with an empty string setting the value to the null
  pointer). The effect of
  [`--load-data-local-dir`](mysql-command-options.md#option_mysql_load-data-local-dir) depends
  on whether `LOCAL` data loading is enabled:

  - If `LOCAL` data loading is enabled,
    either by default in the MySQL client library or by
    specifying
    [`--local-infile[=1]`](mysql-command-options.md#option_mysql_local-infile), the
    [`--load-data-local-dir`](mysql-command-options.md#option_mysql_load-data-local-dir)
    option is ignored.
  - If `LOCAL` data loading is disabled,
    either by default in the MySQL client library or by
    specifying
    [`--local-infile=0`](mysql-command-options.md#option_mysql_local-infile), the
    [`--load-data-local-dir`](mysql-command-options.md#option_mysql_load-data-local-dir)
    option applies.

  When [`--load-data-local-dir`](mysql-command-options.md#option_mysql_load-data-local-dir)
  applies, the option value designates the directory in which
  local data files must be located. Comparison of the
  directory path name and the path name of files to be loaded
  is case-sensitive regardless of the case sensitivity of the
  underlying file system. If the option value is the empty
  string, it names no directory, with the result that no files
  are permitted for local data loading.
- [**mysqlimport**](mysqlimport.md "6.5.5 mysqlimport — A Data Import Program") sets
  `MYSQL_OPT_LOAD_DATA_LOCAL_DIR` for each
  file that it processes so that the directory containing the
  file is the permitted local loading directory.
- For data loading operations corresponding to
  [`LOAD DATA`](load-data.md "15.2.9 LOAD DATA Statement") statements,
  [**mysqlbinlog**](mysqlbinlog.md "6.6.9 mysqlbinlog — Utility for Processing Binary Log Files") extracts the files from the
  binary log events, writes them as temporary files to the
  local file system, and writes
  [`LOAD DATA
  LOCAL`](load-data.md "15.2.9 LOAD DATA Statement") statements to cause the files to be loaded.
  By default, [**mysqlbinlog**](mysqlbinlog.md "6.6.9 mysqlbinlog — Utility for Processing Binary Log Files") writes these
  temporary files to an operating system-specific directory.
  The [`--local-load`](mysqlbinlog.md#option_mysqlbinlog_local-load) option
  can be used to explicitly specify the directory where
  [**mysqlbinlog**](mysqlbinlog.md "6.6.9 mysqlbinlog — Utility for Processing Binary Log Files") should prepare local
  temporary files.

  Because other processes can write files to the default
  system-specific directory, it is advisable to specify the
  [`--local-load`](mysqlbinlog.md#option_mysqlbinlog_local-load) option to
  [**mysqlbinlog**](mysqlbinlog.md "6.6.9 mysqlbinlog — Utility for Processing Binary Log Files") to designate a different
  directory for data files, and then designate that same
  directory by specifying the
  [`--load-data-local-dir`](mysql-command-options.md#option_mysql_load-data-local-dir) option
  to [**mysql**](mysql.md "6.5.1 mysql — The MySQL Command-Line Client") when processing the output from
  [**mysqlbinlog**](mysqlbinlog.md "6.6.9 mysqlbinlog — Utility for Processing Binary Log Files").

#### MySQL Shell and Local Data Loading

MySQL Shell provides a number of utilities to dump tables,
schemas, or server instances and load them into other instances.
When you use these utilities to handle the data, MySQL Shell
provides additional functions such as input preprocessing,
multithreaded parallel loading, file compression and
decompression, and handling access to Oracle Cloud
Infrastructure Object Storage buckets. To get the best
functionality, always use the most recent version available of
MySQL Shell's dump and dump loading utilities.

MySQL Shell's data upload utilities use
[`LOAD DATA LOCAL
INFILE`](load-data.md "15.2.9 LOAD DATA Statement") statements to upload data, so the
[`local_infile`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_local_infile) system variable
must be set to `ON` on the target server
instance. You can do this before uploading the data, and remove
it again afterwards. The utilities handle the file transfer
requests safely to deal with the security considerations
discussed in this topic.

MySQL Shell includes these dump and dump loading utilities:

Table export utility `util.exportTable()`
:   Exports a MySQL relational table into a data file, which
    can be uploaded to a MySQL server instance using
    MySQL Shell's parallel table import utility, imported to
    a different application, or used as a logical backup. The
    utility has preset options and customization options to
    produce different output formats.

Parallel table import utility `util.importTable()`
:   Imports a data file to a MySQL relational table. The data
    file can be the output from MySQL Shell's table export
    utility or another format supported by the utility's
    preset and customization options. The utility can carry
    out input preprocessing before adding the data to the
    table. It can accept multiple data files to merge into a
    single relational table, and automatically decompresses
    compressed files.

Instance dump utility `util.dumpInstance()`, schema dump utility `util.dumpSchemas()`, and table dump utility `util.dumpTables()`
:   Export an instance, schema, or table to a set of dump
    files, which can then be uploaded to a MySQL instance
    using MySQL Shell's dump loading utility. The utilities
    provide Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Object Storage
    streaming, MySQL HeatWave Service compatibility checks and modifications,
    and the ability to carry out a dry run to identify issues
    before proceeding with the dump.

Dump loading utility `util.loadDump()`
:   Import dump files created using MySQL Shell's instance,
    schema, or table dump utility into a MySQL HeatWave Service DB System or a
    MySQL Server instance. The utility manages the upload
    process and provides data streaming from remote storage,
    parallel loading of tables or table chunks, progress state
    tracking, resume and reset capability, and the option of
    concurrent loading while the dump is still taking place.
    MySQL Shell’s parallel table import utility can be used
    in combination with the dump loading utility to modify
    data before uploading it to the target MySQL instance.

For details of the utilities, see
[MySQL Shell Utilities](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/mysql-shell/8.0/en/mysql-shell-utilities.html).
