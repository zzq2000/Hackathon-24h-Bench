[20.5.1.5 Configuring Member Actions](group-replication-member-actions.md)

You can configure an online group while Group Replication is
running by using a set of functions, which rely on a group action
coordinator. These functions are installed by the Group
Replication plugin in version 8.0.13 and higher. This section
describes how changes are made to a running group, and the
available functions.

Important

For the coordinator to be able to configure group wide actions
on a running group, all members must be running MySQL 8.0.13 or
higher and have the functions installed.

To use the functions, connect to a member of the running group and
invoke the function with the [`SELECT`](select.md "15.2.13 SELECT Statement")
statement. The Group Replication plugin processes the action and
its parameters and the coordinator sends it to all members which
are visible to the member where you invoked the function. If the
action is accepted, all members execute the action and send a
termination message when completed. Once all members declare the
action as finished, the invoking member returns the result to the
client.

When configuring a whole group, the distributed nature of the
operations means that they interact with many processes of the
Group Replication plugin, and therefore you should observe the
following:

**You can issue configuration operations everywhere.**
If you want to make member A the new primary you do not need to
invoke the operation on member A. All operations are sent and
executed in a coordinated way on all group members. Also, this
distributed execution of an operation has a different
ramification: if the invoking member dies, any already running
configuration process continues to run on other members. In the
unlikely event that the invoking member dies, you can still use
the monitoring features to ensure other members complete the
operation successfully.

**All members must be online.**
To simplify the migration or election processes and guarantee
they are as fast as possible, the group must not contain any
member currently in the distributed recovery process, otherwise
the configuration action is rejected by the member where you
issue the statement.

**No members can join a group during a configuration change.**
Any member that attempts to join the group during a coordinated
configuration change leaves the group and cancels its join
process.

**Only one configuration at once.**
A group which is executing a configuration change cannot accept
any other group configuration change, because concurrent
configuration operations could lead to member divergence.

**All members must be running MySQL 8.0.13 or higher.**
Due to the distributed nature of the configuration actions, all
members must recognize them in order to execute them. The
operation is therefore rejected if any server running MySQL
Server version 8.0.12 or lower is present in the group.
