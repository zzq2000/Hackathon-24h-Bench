#### 25.3.2.1 Installing NDB Cluster on Windows from a Binary Release

This section describes a basic installation of NDB Cluster on
Windows using a binary “no-install” NDB Cluster
release provided by Oracle, using the same 4-node setup outlined
in the beginning of this section (see
[Section 25.3, “NDB Cluster Installation”](mysql-cluster-installation.md "25.3 NDB Cluster Installation")), as shown in the
following table:

**Table 25.7 Network addresses of nodes in example cluster**

| Node | IP Address |
| --- | --- |
| Management node (**mgmd**) | 198.51.100.10 |
| SQL node ([**mysqld**](mysqld.md "6.3.1 mysqld — The MySQL Server")) | 198.51.100.20 |
| Data node "A" ([**ndbd**](mysql-cluster-programs-ndbd.md "25.5.1 ndbd — The NDB Cluster Data Node Daemon")) | 198.51.100.30 |
| Data node "B" ([**ndbd**](mysql-cluster-programs-ndbd.md "25.5.1 ndbd — The NDB Cluster Data Node Daemon")) | 198.51.100.40 |

As on other platforms, the NDB Cluster host computer running an
SQL node must have installed on it a MySQL Server binary
([**mysqld.exe**](mysqld.md "6.3.1 mysqld — The MySQL Server")). You should also have the MySQL
client ([**mysql.exe**](mysql.md "6.5.1 mysql — The MySQL Command-Line Client")) on this host. For
management nodes and data nodes, it is not necessary to install
the MySQL Server binary; however, each management node requires
the management server daemon ([**ndb\_mgmd.exe**](mysql-cluster-programs-ndb-mgmd.md "25.5.4 ndb_mgmd — The NDB Cluster Management Server Daemon"));
each data node requires the data node daemon
([**ndbd.exe**](mysql-cluster-programs-ndbd.md "25.5.1 ndbd — The NDB Cluster Data Node Daemon") or [**ndbmtd.exe**](mysql-cluster-programs-ndbmtd.md "25.5.3 ndbmtd — The NDB Cluster Data Node Daemon (Multi-Threaded)")).
For this example, we refer to [**ndbd.exe**](mysql-cluster-programs-ndbd.md "25.5.1 ndbd — The NDB Cluster Data Node Daemon") as the
data node executable, but you can install
[**ndbmtd.exe**](mysql-cluster-programs-ndbmtd.md "25.5.3 ndbmtd — The NDB Cluster Data Node Daemon (Multi-Threaded)"), the multithreaded version of this
program, instead, in exactly the same way. You should also
install the management client ([**ndb\_mgm.exe**](mysql-cluster-programs-ndb-mgm.md "25.5.5 ndb_mgm — The NDB Cluster Management Client"))
on the management server host. This section covers the steps
necessary to install the correct Windows binaries for each type
of NDB Cluster node.

Note

As with other Windows programs, NDB Cluster executables are
named with the `.exe` file extension.
However, it is not necessary to include the
`.exe` extension when invoking these
programs from the command line. Therefore, we often simply
refer to these programs in this documentation as
[**mysqld**](mysqld.md "6.3.1 mysqld — The MySQL Server"), [**mysql**](mysql.md "6.5.1 mysql — The MySQL Command-Line Client"),
[**ndb\_mgmd**](mysql-cluster-programs-ndb-mgmd.md "25.5.4 ndb_mgmd — The NDB Cluster Management Server Daemon"), and so on. You should understand
that, whether we refer (for example) to
[**mysqld**](mysqld.md "6.3.1 mysqld — The MySQL Server") or [**mysqld.exe**](mysqld.md "6.3.1 mysqld — The MySQL Server"),
either name means the same thing (the MySQL Server program).

For setting up an NDB Cluster using Oracles's
`no-install` binaries, the first step in the
installation process is to download the latest NDB Cluster
Windows ZIP binary archive from
<https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/cluster/>. This archive has a
filename of the
`mysql-cluster-gpl-ver-winarch.zip`,
where *`ver`* is the
`NDB` storage engine version (such as
`8.0.43`), and
*`arch`* is the architecture
(`32` for 32-bit binaries, and
`64` for 64-bit binaries). For example, the NDB
Cluster 8.0.43 archive for 64-bit Windows
systems is named
`mysql-cluster-gpl-8.0.43-win64.zip`.

You can run 32-bit NDB Cluster binaries on both 32-bit and
64-bit versions of Windows; however, 64-bit NDB Cluster binaries
can be used only on 64-bit versions of Windows. If you are using
a 32-bit version of Windows on a computer that has a 64-bit CPU,
then you must use the 32-bit NDB Cluster binaries.

To minimize the number of files that need to be downloaded from
the Internet or copied between machines, we start with the
computer where you intend to run the SQL node.

**SQL node.**
We assume that you have placed a copy of the archive in the
directory `C:\Documents and
Settings\username\My
Documents\Downloads` on the computer having the IP
address 198.51.100.20, where
*`username`* is the name of the current
user. (You can obtain this name using `ECHO
%USERNAME%` on the command line.) To install and run
NDB Cluster executables as Windows services, this user should
be a member of the `Administrators` group.

Extract all the files from the archive. The Extraction Wizard
integrated with Windows Explorer is adequate for this task. (If
you use a different archive program, be sure that it extracts
all files and directories from the archive, and that it
preserves the archive's directory structure.) When you are
asked for a destination directory, enter
`C:\`, which causes the Extraction Wizard to
extract the archive to the directory
`C:\mysql-cluster-gpl-ver-winarch`.
Rename this directory to `C:\mysql`.

It is possible to install the NDB Cluster binaries to
directories other than `C:\mysql\bin`;
however, if you do so, you must modify the paths shown in this
procedure accordingly. In particular, if the MySQL Server (SQL
node) binary is installed to a location other than
`C:\mysql` or `C:\Program
Files\MySQL\MySQL Server 8.0`, or if the
SQL node's data directory is in a location other than
`C:\mysql\data` or `C:\Program
Files\MySQL\MySQL Server 8.0\data`, extra
configuration options must be used on the command line or added
to the `my.ini` or
`my.cnf` file when starting the SQL node. For
more information about configuring a MySQL Server to run in a
nonstandard location, see
[Section 2.3.4, “Installing MySQL on Microsoft Windows Using a
`noinstall` ZIP Archive”](windows-install-archive.md "2.3.4 Installing MySQL on Microsoft Windows Using a noinstall ZIP Archive").

For a MySQL Server with NDB Cluster support to run as part of an
NDB Cluster, it must be started with the options
[`--ndbcluster`](mysql-cluster-options-variables.md#option_mysqld_ndbcluster) and
[`--ndb-connectstring`](mysql-cluster-options-variables.md#option_mysqld_ndb-connectstring). While you
can specify these options on the command line, it is usually
more convenient to place them in an option file. To do this,
create a new text file in Notepad or another text editor. Enter
the following configuration information into this file:

```ini
[mysqld]
# Options for mysqld process:
ndbcluster                       # run NDB storage engine
ndb-connectstring=198.51.100.10  # location of management server
```

You can add other options used by this MySQL Server if desired
(see [Section 2.3.4.2, “Creating an Option File”](windows-create-option-file.md "2.3.4.2 Creating an Option File")), but the file
must contain the options shown, at a minimum. Save this file as
`C:\mysql\my.ini`. This completes the
installation and setup for the SQL node.

**Data nodes.**
An NDB Cluster data node on a Windows host requires only a
single executable, one of either [**ndbd.exe**](mysql-cluster-programs-ndbd.md "25.5.1 ndbd — The NDB Cluster Data Node Daemon")
or [**ndbmtd.exe**](mysql-cluster-programs-ndbmtd.md "25.5.3 ndbmtd — The NDB Cluster Data Node Daemon (Multi-Threaded)"). For this example, we assume
that you are using [**ndbd.exe**](mysql-cluster-programs-ndbd.md "25.5.1 ndbd — The NDB Cluster Data Node Daemon"), but the same
instructions apply when using [**ndbmtd.exe**](mysql-cluster-programs-ndbmtd.md "25.5.3 ndbmtd — The NDB Cluster Data Node Daemon (Multi-Threaded)").
On each computer where you wish to run a data node (the
computers having the IP addresses 198.51.100.30 and
198.51.100.40), create the directories
`C:\mysql`,
`C:\mysql\bin`, and
`C:\mysql\cluster-data`; then, on the
computer where you downloaded and extracted the
`no-install` archive, locate
`ndbd.exe` in the
`C:\mysql\bin` directory. Copy this file to
the `C:\mysql\bin` directory on each of the
two data node hosts.

To function as part of an NDB Cluster, each data node must be
given the address or hostname of the management server. You can
supply this information on the command line using the
[`--ndb-connectstring`](mysql-cluster-programs-ndb-config.md#option_ndb_config_ndb-connectstring) or
`-c` option when starting each data node process.
However, it is usually preferable to put this information in an
option file. To do this, create a new text file in Notepad or
another text editor and enter the following text:

```ini
[mysql_cluster]
# Options for data node process:
ndb-connectstring=198.51.100.10  # location of management server
```

Save this file as `C:\mysql\my.ini` on the
data node host. Create another text file containing the same
information and save it on as
`C:mysql\my.ini` on the other data node host,
or copy the my.ini file from the first data node host to the
second one, making sure to place the copy in the second data
node's `C:\mysql` directory. Both data
node hosts are now ready to be used in the NDB Cluster, which
leaves only the management node to be installed and configured.

**Management node.**
The only executable program required on a computer used for
hosting an NDB Cluster management node is the management
server program [**ndb\_mgmd.exe**](mysql-cluster-programs-ndb-mgmd.md "25.5.4 ndb_mgmd — The NDB Cluster Management Server Daemon"). However, in
order to administer the NDB Cluster once it has been started,
you should also install the NDB Cluster management client
program [**ndb\_mgm.exe**](mysql-cluster-programs-ndb-mgm.md "25.5.5 ndb_mgm — The NDB Cluster Management Client") on the same machine as
the management server. Locate these two programs on the
machine where you downloaded and extracted the
`no-install` archive; this should be the
directory `C:\mysql\bin` on the SQL node
host. Create the directory `C:\mysql\bin`
on the computer having the IP address 198.51.100.10, then copy
both programs to this directory.

You should now create two configuration files for use by
`ndb_mgmd.exe`:

1. A local configuration file to supply configuration data
   specific to the management node itself. Typically, this file
   needs only to supply the location of the NDB Cluster global
   configuration file (see item 2).

   To create this file, start a new text file in Notepad or
   another text editor, and enter the following information:

   ```ini
   [mysql_cluster]
   # Options for management node process
   config-file=C:/mysql/bin/config.ini
   ```

   Save this file as the text file
   `C:\mysql\bin\my.ini`.
2. A global configuration file from which the management node
   can obtain configuration information governing the NDB
   Cluster as a whole. At a minimum, this file must contain a
   section for each node in the NDB Cluster, and the IP
   addresses or hostnames for the management node and all data
   nodes (`HostName` configuration parameter).
   It is also advisable to include the following additional
   information:

   - The IP address or hostname of any SQL nodes
   - The data memory and index memory allocated to each data
     node ([`DataMemory`](mysql-cluster-ndbd-definition.md#ndbparam-ndbd-datamemory)
     and [`IndexMemory`](mysql-cluster-ndbd-definition.md#ndbparam-ndbd-indexmemory)
     configuration parameters)
   - The number of fragment replicas, using the
     [`NoOfReplicas`](mysql-cluster-ndbd-definition.md#ndbparam-ndbd-noofreplicas)
     configuration parameter (see
     [Section 25.2.2, “NDB Cluster Nodes, Node Groups, Fragment Replicas, and Partitions”](mysql-cluster-nodes-groups.md "25.2.2 NDB Cluster Nodes, Node Groups, Fragment Replicas, and Partitions"))
   - The directory where each data node stores it data and
     log file, and the directory where the management node
     keeps its log files (in both cases, the
     [`DataDir`](mysql-cluster-ndbd-definition.md#ndbparam-ndbd-datadir)
     configuration parameter)

   Create a new text file using a text editor such as Notepad,
   and input the following information:

   ```ini
   [ndbd default]
   # Options affecting ndbd processes on all data nodes:
   NoOfReplicas=2                      # Number of fragment replicas
   DataDir=C:/mysql/cluster-data       # Directory for each data node's data files
                                       # Forward slashes used in directory path,
                                       # rather than backslashes. This is correct;
                                       # see Important note in text
   DataMemory=80M    # Memory allocated to data storage
   IndexMemory=18M   # Memory allocated to index storage
                     # For DataMemory and IndexMemory, we have used the
                     # default values. Since the "world" database takes up
                     # only about 500KB, this should be more than enough for
                     # this example Cluster setup.

   [ndb_mgmd]
   # Management process options:
   HostName=198.51.100.10              # Hostname or IP address of management node
   DataDir=C:/mysql/bin/cluster-logs   # Directory for management node log files

   [ndbd]
   # Options for data node "A":
                                   # (one [ndbd] section per data node)
   HostName=198.51.100.30          # Hostname or IP address

   [ndbd]
   # Options for data node "B":
   HostName=198.51.100.40          # Hostname or IP address

   [mysqld]
   # SQL node options:
   HostName=198.51.100.20          # Hostname or IP address
   ```

   Save this file as the text file
   `C:\mysql\bin\config.ini`.

Important

A single backslash character (`\`) cannot be
used when specifying directory paths in program options or
configuration files used by NDB Cluster on Windows. Instead,
you must either escape each backslash character with a second
backslash (`\\`), or replace the backslash
with a forward slash character (`/`). For
example, the following line from the
`[ndb_mgmd]` section of an NDB Cluster
`config.ini` file does not work:

```ini
DataDir=C:\mysql\bin\cluster-logs
```

Instead, you may use either of the following:

```ini
DataDir=C:\\mysql\\bin\\cluster-logs  # Escaped backslashes
```

```ini
DataDir=C:/mysql/bin/cluster-logs     # Forward slashes
```

For reasons of brevity and legibility, we recommend that you
use forward slashes in directory paths used in NDB Cluster
program options and configuration files on Windows.
