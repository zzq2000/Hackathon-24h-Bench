#### 25.6.20.3 NDB Cluster and MySQL Security Procedures

In this section, we discuss MySQL standard security procedures
as they apply to running NDB Cluster.

In general, any standard procedure for running MySQL securely
also applies to running a MySQL Server as part of an NDB
Cluster. First and foremost, you should always run a MySQL
Server as the `mysql` operating system user;
this is no different from running MySQL in a standard
(non-Cluster) environment. The `mysql` system
account should be uniquely and clearly defined. Fortunately,
this is the default behavior for a new MySQL installation. You
can verify that the [**mysqld**](mysqld.md "6.3.1 mysqld — The MySQL Server") process is running
as the `mysql` operating system user by using
the system command such as the one shown here:

```terminal
$> ps aux | grep mysql
root     10467  0.0  0.1   3616  1380 pts/3    S    11:53   0:00 \
  /bin/sh ./mysqld_safe --ndbcluster --ndb-connectstring=localhost:1186
mysql    10512  0.2  2.5  58528 26636 pts/3    Sl   11:53   0:00 \
  /usr/local/mysql/libexec/mysqld --basedir=/usr/local/mysql \
  --datadir=/usr/local/mysql/var --user=mysql --ndbcluster \
  --ndb-connectstring=localhost:1186 --pid-file=/usr/local/mysql/var/mothra.pid \
  --log-error=/usr/local/mysql/var/mothra.err
jon      10579  0.0  0.0   2736   688 pts/0    S+   11:54   0:00 grep mysql
```

If the [**mysqld**](mysqld.md "6.3.1 mysqld — The MySQL Server") process is running as any other
user than `mysql`, you should immediately shut
it down and restart it as the `mysql` user. If
this user does not exist on the system, the
`mysql` user account should be created, and
this user should be part of the `mysql` user
group; in this case, you should also make sure that the MySQL
data directory on this system (as set using the
[`--datadir`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_datadir) option for
[**mysqld**](mysqld.md "6.3.1 mysqld — The MySQL Server")) is owned by the
`mysql` user, and that the SQL node's
`my.cnf` file includes
`user=mysql` in the `[mysqld]`
section. Alternatively, you can start the MySQL server process
with [`--user=mysql`](server-options.md#option_mysqld_user) on the command
line, but it is preferable to use the
`my.cnf` option, since you might forget to
use the command-line option and so have
[**mysqld**](mysqld.md "6.3.1 mysqld — The MySQL Server") running as another user
unintentionally. The [**mysqld\_safe**](mysqld-safe.md "6.3.2 mysqld_safe — MySQL Server Startup Script") startup
script forces MySQL to run as the `mysql` user.

Important

Never run [**mysqld**](mysqld.md "6.3.1 mysqld — The MySQL Server") as the system root user.
Doing so means that potentially any file on the system can be
read by MySQL, and thus—should MySQL be
compromised—by an attacker.

As mentioned in the previous section (see
[Section 25.6.20.2, “NDB Cluster and MySQL Privileges”](mysql-cluster-security-mysql-privileges.md "25.6.20.2 NDB Cluster and MySQL Privileges")), you
should always set a root password for the MySQL Server as soon
as you have it running. You should also delete the anonymous
user account that is installed by default. You can accomplish
these tasks using the following statements:

```sql
$> mysql -u root

mysql> UPDATE mysql.user
    ->     SET Password=PASSWORD('secure_password')
    ->     WHERE User='root';

mysql> DELETE FROM mysql.user
    ->     WHERE User='';

mysql> FLUSH PRIVILEGES;
```

Be very careful when executing the
[`DELETE`](delete.md "15.2.2 DELETE Statement") statement not to omit the
`WHERE` clause, or you risk deleting
*all* MySQL users. Be sure to run the
[`FLUSH PRIVILEGES`](flush.md#flush-privileges) statement as
soon as you have modified the `mysql.user`
table, so that the changes take immediate effect. Without
[`FLUSH PRIVILEGES`](flush.md#flush-privileges), the changes do
not take effect until the next time that the server is
restarted.

Note

Many of the NDB Cluster utilities such as
[**ndb\_show\_tables**](mysql-cluster-programs-ndb-show-tables.md "25.5.27 ndb_show_tables — Display List of NDB Tables"),
[**ndb\_desc**](mysql-cluster-programs-ndb-desc.md "25.5.9 ndb_desc — Describe NDB Tables"), and
[**ndb\_select\_all**](mysql-cluster-programs-ndb-select-all.md "25.5.25 ndb_select_all — Print Rows from an NDB Table") also work without
authentication and can reveal table names, schemas, and data.
By default these are installed on Unix-style systems with the
permissions `wxr-xr-x` (755), which means
they can be executed by any user that can access the
`mysql/bin` directory.

See [Section 25.5, “NDB Cluster Programs”](mysql-cluster-programs.md "25.5 NDB Cluster Programs"), for more
information about these utilities.
