#### 8.4.4.15 General-Purpose Keyring Key-Management Functions

MySQL Server supports a keyring service that enables internal
components and plugins to store sensitive information securely
for later retrieval.

MySQL Server also includes an SQL interface for keyring key
management, implemented as a set of general-purpose functions
that access the capabilities provided by the internal keyring
service. The keyring functions are contained in a plugin library
file, which also contains a `keyring_udf`
plugin that must be enabled prior to function invocation. For
these functions to be used, a keyring plugin such as
`keyring_file` or
`keyring_okv`, or a keyring component such as
`component_keyring_file` or
`component_keyring_encrypted_file`, must be
enabled.

The functions described here are general-purpose and intended
for use with any keyring component or plugin. A given keyring
component or plugin may also provide functions of its own that
are intended for use only with that component or plugin; see
[Section 8.4.4.16, “Plugin-Specific Keyring Key-Management Functions”](keyring-functions-plugin-specific.md "8.4.4.16 Plugin-Specific Keyring Key-Management Functions").

The following sections provide installation instructions for the
keyring functions and demonstrate how to use them. For
information about the keyring service functions invoked by these
functions, see [Section 7.6.9.2, “The Keyring Service”](keyring-service.md "7.6.9.2 The Keyring Service"). For general
keyring information, see [Section 8.4.4, “The MySQL Keyring”](keyring.md "8.4.4 The MySQL Keyring").

- [General-Purpose Keyring Function Reference](keyring-functions-general-purpose.md#keyring-function-reference "General-Purpose Keyring Function Reference")

##### Installing or Uninstalling General-Purpose Keyring Functions

This section describes how to install or uninstall the keyring
functions, which are implemented in a plugin library file that
also contains a `keyring_udf` plugin. For
general information about installing or uninstalling plugins
and loadable functions, see [Section 7.6.1, “Installing and Uninstalling Plugins”](plugin-loading.md "7.6.1 Installing and Uninstalling Plugins"),
and [Section 7.7.1, “Installing and Uninstalling Loadable Functions”](function-loading.md "7.7.1 Installing and Uninstalling Loadable Functions").

The keyring functions enable keyring key management
operations, but the `keyring_udf` plugin must
also be installed because the functions do not work correctly
without it. Attempts to use the functions without the
`keyring_udf` plugin result in an error.

To be usable by the server, the plugin library file must be
located in the MySQL plugin directory (the directory named by
the [`plugin_dir`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_plugin_dir) system
variable). If necessary, configure the plugin directory
location by setting the value of
[`plugin_dir`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_plugin_dir) at server startup.

The plugin library file base name is
`keyring_udf`. The file name suffix differs
per platform (for example, `.so` for Unix
and Unix-like systems, `.dll` for Windows).

To install the `keyring_udf` plugin and the
keyring functions, use the [`INSTALL
PLUGIN`](install-plugin.md "15.7.4.4 INSTALL PLUGIN Statement") and [`CREATE
FUNCTION`](create-function.md "15.1.14 CREATE FUNCTION Statement") statements, adjusting the
`.so` suffix for your platform as
necessary:

```sql
INSTALL PLUGIN keyring_udf SONAME 'keyring_udf.so';
CREATE FUNCTION keyring_key_generate RETURNS INTEGER
  SONAME 'keyring_udf.so';
CREATE FUNCTION keyring_key_fetch RETURNS STRING
  SONAME 'keyring_udf.so';
CREATE FUNCTION keyring_key_length_fetch RETURNS INTEGER
  SONAME 'keyring_udf.so';
CREATE FUNCTION keyring_key_type_fetch RETURNS STRING
  SONAME 'keyring_udf.so';
CREATE FUNCTION keyring_key_store RETURNS INTEGER
  SONAME 'keyring_udf.so';
CREATE FUNCTION keyring_key_remove RETURNS INTEGER
  SONAME 'keyring_udf.so';
```

If the plugin and functions are used on a source replication
server, install them on all replicas as well to avoid
replication issues.

Once installed as just described, the plugin and functions
remain installed until uninstalled. To remove them, use the
[`UNINSTALL PLUGIN`](uninstall-plugin.md "15.7.4.6 UNINSTALL PLUGIN Statement") and
[`DROP FUNCTION`](drop-function.md "15.1.26 DROP FUNCTION Statement") statements:

```sql
UNINSTALL PLUGIN keyring_udf;
DROP FUNCTION keyring_key_generate;
DROP FUNCTION keyring_key_fetch;
DROP FUNCTION keyring_key_length_fetch;
DROP FUNCTION keyring_key_type_fetch;
DROP FUNCTION keyring_key_store;
DROP FUNCTION keyring_key_remove;
```

##### Using General-Purpose Keyring Functions

Before using the keyring general-purpose functions, install
them according to the instructions provided in
[Installing or Uninstalling General-Purpose Keyring Functions](keyring-functions-general-purpose.md#keyring-function-installation "Installing or Uninstalling General-Purpose Keyring Functions").

The keyring functions are subject to these constraints:

- To use any keyring function, the
  `keyring_udf` plugin must be enabled.
  Otherwise, an error occurs:

  ```none
  ERROR 1123 (HY000): Can't initialize function 'keyring_key_generate';
  This function requires keyring_udf plugin which is not installed.
  Please install
  ```

  To install the `keyring_udf` plugin, see
  [Installing or Uninstalling General-Purpose Keyring Functions](keyring-functions-general-purpose.md#keyring-function-installation "Installing or Uninstalling General-Purpose Keyring Functions").
- The keyring functions invoke keyring service functions
  (see [Section 7.6.9.2, “The Keyring Service”](keyring-service.md "7.6.9.2 The Keyring Service")). The service
  functions in turn use whatever keyring plugin is installed
  (for example, `keyring_file` or
  `keyring_okv`). Therefore, to use any
  keyring function, some underlying keyring plugin must be
  enabled. Otherwise, an error occurs:

  ```none
  ERROR 3188 (HY000): Function 'keyring_key_generate' failed because
  underlying keyring service returned an error. Please check if a
  keyring plugin is installed and that provided arguments are valid
  for the keyring you are using.
  ```

  To install a keyring plugin, see
  [Section 8.4.4.3, “Keyring Plugin Installation”](keyring-plugin-installation.md "8.4.4.3 Keyring Plugin Installation").
- A user must possess the global
  [`EXECUTE`](privileges-provided.md#priv_execute) privilege to use
  any keyring function. Otherwise, an error occurs:

  ```none
  ERROR 1123 (HY000): Can't initialize function 'keyring_key_generate';
  The user is not privileged to execute this function. User needs to
  have EXECUTE
  ```

  To grant the global [`EXECUTE`](privileges-provided.md#priv_execute)
  privilege to a user, use this statement:

  ```sql
  GRANT EXECUTE ON *.* TO user;
  ```

  Alternatively, should you prefer to avoid granting the
  global [`EXECUTE`](privileges-provided.md#priv_execute) privilege
  while still permitting users to access specific
  key-management operations, “wrapper” stored
  programs can be defined (a technique described later in
  this section).
- A key stored in the keyring by a given user can be
  manipulated later only by the same user. That is, the
  value of the [`CURRENT_USER()`](information-functions.md#function_current-user)
  function at the time of key manipulation must have the
  same value as when the key was stored in the keyring.
  (This constraint rules out the use of the keyring
  functions for manipulation of instance-wide keys, such as
  those created by `InnoDB` to support
  tablespace encryption.)

  To enable multiple users to perform operations on the same
  key, “wrapper” stored programs can be defined
  (a technique described later in this section).
- Keyring functions support the key types and lengths
  supported by the underlying keyring plugin. For
  information about keys specific to a particular keyring
  plugin, see [Section 8.4.4.13, “Supported Keyring Key Types and Lengths”](keyring-key-types.md "8.4.4.13 Supported Keyring Key Types and Lengths").

To create a new random key and store it in the keyring, call
[`keyring_key_generate()`](keyring-functions-general-purpose.md#function_keyring-key-generate), passing
to it an ID for the key, along with the key type (encryption
method) and its length in bytes. The following call creates a
2,048-bit DSA-encrypted key named `MyKey`:

```sql
mysql> SELECT keyring_key_generate('MyKey', 'DSA', 256);
+-------------------------------------------+
| keyring_key_generate('MyKey', 'DSA', 256) |
+-------------------------------------------+
|                                         1 |
+-------------------------------------------+
```

A return value of 1 indicates success. If the key cannot be
created, the return value is `NULL` and an
error occurs. One reason this might be is that the underlying
keyring plugin does not support the specified combination of
key type and key length; see
[Section 8.4.4.13, “Supported Keyring Key Types and Lengths”](keyring-key-types.md "8.4.4.13 Supported Keyring Key Types and Lengths").

To be able to check the return type regardless of whether an
error occurs, use `SELECT ... INTO
@var_name` and test the
variable value:

```sql
mysql> SELECT keyring_key_generate('', '', -1) INTO @x;
ERROR 3188 (HY000): Function 'keyring_key_generate' failed because
underlying keyring service returned an error. Please check if a
keyring plugin is installed and that provided arguments are valid
for the keyring you are using.
mysql> SELECT @x;
+------+
| @x   |
+------+
| NULL |
+------+
mysql> SELECT keyring_key_generate('x', 'AES', 16) INTO @x;
mysql> SELECT @x;
+------+
| @x   |
+------+
|    1 |
+------+
```

This technique also applies to other keyring functions that
for failure return a value and an error.

The ID passed to
[`keyring_key_generate()`](keyring-functions-general-purpose.md#function_keyring-key-generate) provides
a means by which to refer to the key in subsequent functions
calls. For example, use the key ID to retrieve its type as a
string or its length in bytes as an integer:

```sql
mysql> SELECT keyring_key_type_fetch('MyKey');
+---------------------------------+
| keyring_key_type_fetch('MyKey') |
+---------------------------------+
| DSA                             |
+---------------------------------+
mysql> SELECT keyring_key_length_fetch('MyKey');
+-----------------------------------+
| keyring_key_length_fetch('MyKey') |
+-----------------------------------+
|                               256 |
+-----------------------------------+
```

To retrieve a key value, pass the key ID to
[`keyring_key_fetch()`](keyring-functions-general-purpose.md#function_keyring-key-fetch). The
following example uses [`HEX()`](string-functions.md#function_hex) to
display the key value because it may contain nonprintable
characters. The example also uses a short key for brevity, but
be aware that longer keys provide better security:

```sql
mysql> SELECT keyring_key_generate('MyShortKey', 'DSA', 8);
+----------------------------------------------+
| keyring_key_generate('MyShortKey', 'DSA', 8) |
+----------------------------------------------+
|                                            1 |
+----------------------------------------------+
mysql> SELECT HEX(keyring_key_fetch('MyShortKey'));
+--------------------------------------+
| HEX(keyring_key_fetch('MyShortKey')) |
+--------------------------------------+
| 1DB3B0FC3328A24C                     |
+--------------------------------------+
```

Keyring functions treat key IDs, types, and values as binary
strings, so comparisons are case-sensitive. For example, IDs
of `MyKey` and `mykey` refer
to different keys.

To remove a key, pass the key ID to
[`keyring_key_remove()`](keyring-functions-general-purpose.md#function_keyring-key-remove):

```sql
mysql> SELECT keyring_key_remove('MyKey');
+-----------------------------+
| keyring_key_remove('MyKey') |
+-----------------------------+
|                           1 |
+-----------------------------+
```

To obfuscate and store a key that you provide, pass the key
ID, type, and value to
[`keyring_key_store()`](keyring-functions-general-purpose.md#function_keyring-key-store):

```sql
mysql> SELECT keyring_key_store('AES_key', 'AES', 'Secret string');
+------------------------------------------------------+
| keyring_key_store('AES_key', 'AES', 'Secret string') |
+------------------------------------------------------+
|                                                    1 |
+------------------------------------------------------+
```

As indicated previously, a user must have the global
[`EXECUTE`](privileges-provided.md#priv_execute) privilege to call
keyring functions, and the user who stores a key in the
keyring initially must be the same user who performs
subsequent operations on the key later, as determined from the
[`CURRENT_USER()`](information-functions.md#function_current-user) value in effect
for each function call. To permit key operations to users who
do not have the global [`EXECUTE`](privileges-provided.md#priv_execute)
privilege or who may not be the key “owner,” use
this technique:

1. Define “wrapper” stored programs that
   encapsulate the required key operations and have a
   `DEFINER` value equal to the key owner.
2. Grant the [`EXECUTE`](privileges-provided.md#priv_execute) privilege
   for specific stored programs to the individual users who
   should be able to invoke them.
3. If the operations implemented by the wrapper stored
   programs do not include key creation, create any necessary
   keys in advance, using the account named as the
   `DEFINER` in the stored program
   definitions.

This technique enables keys to be shared among users and
provides to DBAs more fine-grained control over who can do
what with keys, without having to grant global privileges.

The following example shows how to set up a shared key named
`SharedKey` that is owned by the DBA, and a
`get_shared_key()` stored function that
provides access to the current key value. The value can be
retrieved by any user with the
[`EXECUTE`](privileges-provided.md#priv_execute) privilege for that
function, which is created in the
`key_schema` schema.

From a MySQL administrative account
(`'root'@'localhost'` in this example),
create the administrative schema and the stored function to
access the key:

```sql
mysql> CREATE SCHEMA key_schema;

mysql> CREATE DEFINER = 'root'@'localhost'
       FUNCTION key_schema.get_shared_key()
       RETURNS BLOB READS SQL DATA
       RETURN keyring_key_fetch('SharedKey');
```

From the administrative account, ensure that the shared key
exists:

```sql
mysql> SELECT keyring_key_generate('SharedKey', 'DSA', 8);
+---------------------------------------------+
| keyring_key_generate('SharedKey', 'DSA', 8) |
+---------------------------------------------+
|                                           1 |
+---------------------------------------------+
```

From the administrative account, create an ordinary user
account to which key access is to be granted:

```sql
mysql> CREATE USER 'key_user'@'localhost'
       IDENTIFIED BY 'key_user_pwd';
```

From the `key_user` account, verify that,
without the proper [`EXECUTE`](privileges-provided.md#priv_execute)
privilege, the new account cannot access the shared key:

```sql
mysql> SELECT HEX(key_schema.get_shared_key());
ERROR 1370 (42000): execute command denied to user 'key_user'@'localhost'
for routine 'key_schema.get_shared_key'
```

From the administrative account, grant
[`EXECUTE`](privileges-provided.md#priv_execute) to
`key_user` for the stored function:

```sql
mysql> GRANT EXECUTE ON FUNCTION key_schema.get_shared_key
       TO 'key_user'@'localhost';
```

From the `key_user` account, verify that the
key is now accessible:

```sql
mysql> SELECT HEX(key_schema.get_shared_key());
+----------------------------------+
| HEX(key_schema.get_shared_key()) |
+----------------------------------+
| 9BAFB9E75CEEB013                 |
+----------------------------------+
```

##### General-Purpose Keyring Function Reference

For each general-purpose keyring function, this section
describes its purpose, calling sequence, and return value. For
information about the conditions under which these functions
can be invoked, see [Using General-Purpose Keyring Functions](keyring-functions-general-purpose.md#keyring-function-usage "Using General-Purpose Keyring Functions").

- [`keyring_key_fetch(key_id)`](keyring-functions-general-purpose.md#function_keyring-key-fetch)

  Given a key ID, deobfuscates and returns the key value.

  Arguments:

  - *`key_id`*: A string that
    specifies the key ID.

  Return value:

  Returns the key value as a string for success,
  `NULL` if the key does not exist, or
  `NULL` and an error for failure.

  Note

  Key values retrieved using
  [`keyring_key_fetch()`](keyring-functions-general-purpose.md#function_keyring-key-fetch) are
  subject to the general keyring function limits described
  in [Section 8.4.4.13, “Supported Keyring Key Types and Lengths”](keyring-key-types.md "8.4.4.13 Supported Keyring Key Types and Lengths"). A key value
  longer than that length can be stored using a keyring
  service function (see
  [Section 7.6.9.2, “The Keyring Service”](keyring-service.md "7.6.9.2 The Keyring Service")), but if retrieved
  using [`keyring_key_fetch()`](keyring-functions-general-purpose.md#function_keyring-key-fetch)
  is truncated to the general keyring function limit.

  Example:

  ```sql
  mysql> SELECT keyring_key_generate('RSA_key', 'RSA', 16);
  +--------------------------------------------+
  | keyring_key_generate('RSA_key', 'RSA', 16) |
  +--------------------------------------------+
  |                                          1 |
  +--------------------------------------------+
  mysql> SELECT HEX(keyring_key_fetch('RSA_key'));
  +-----------------------------------+
  | HEX(keyring_key_fetch('RSA_key')) |
  +-----------------------------------+
  | 91C2253B696064D3556984B6630F891A  |
  +-----------------------------------+
  mysql> SELECT keyring_key_type_fetch('RSA_key');
  +-----------------------------------+
  | keyring_key_type_fetch('RSA_key') |
  +-----------------------------------+
  | RSA                               |
  +-----------------------------------+
  mysql> SELECT keyring_key_length_fetch('RSA_key');
  +-------------------------------------+
  | keyring_key_length_fetch('RSA_key') |
  +-------------------------------------+
  |                                  16 |
  +-------------------------------------+
  ```

  The example uses [`HEX()`](string-functions.md#function_hex) to
  display the key value because it may contain nonprintable
  characters. The example also uses a short key for brevity,
  but be aware that longer keys provide better security.
- [`keyring_key_generate(key_id,
  key_type,
  key_length)`](keyring-functions-general-purpose.md#function_keyring-key-generate)

  Generates a new random key with a given ID, type, and
  length, and stores it in the keyring. The type and length
  values must be consistent with the values supported by the
  underlying keyring plugin. See
  [Section 8.4.4.13, “Supported Keyring Key Types and Lengths”](keyring-key-types.md "8.4.4.13 Supported Keyring Key Types and Lengths").

  Arguments:

  - *`key_id`*: A string that
    specifies the key ID.
  - *`key_type`*: A string that
    specifies the key type.
  - *`key_length`*: An integer that
    specifies the key length in bytes.

  Return value:

  Returns 1 for success, or `NULL` and an
  error for failure.

  Example:

  ```sql
  mysql> SELECT keyring_key_generate('RSA_key', 'RSA', 384);
  +---------------------------------------------+
  | keyring_key_generate('RSA_key', 'RSA', 384) |
  +---------------------------------------------+
  |                                           1 |
  +---------------------------------------------+
  ```
- [`keyring_key_length_fetch(key_id)`](keyring-functions-general-purpose.md#function_keyring-key-length-fetch)

  Given a key ID, returns the key length.

  Arguments:

  - *`key_id`*: A string that
    specifies the key ID.

  `NULL` if the key does not exist, or
  `NULL` and an error for failure.

  Example:

  See the description of
  [`keyring_key_fetch()`](keyring-functions-general-purpose.md#function_keyring-key-fetch).
- [`keyring_key_remove(key_id)`](keyring-functions-general-purpose.md#function_keyring-key-remove)

  Removes the key with a given ID from the keyring.

  Arguments:

  - *`key_id`*: A string that
    specifies the key ID.

  Return value:

  Returns 1 for success, or `NULL` for
  failure.

  Example:

  ```sql
  mysql> SELECT keyring_key_remove('AES_key');
  +-------------------------------+
  | keyring_key_remove('AES_key') |
  +-------------------------------+
  |                             1 |
  +-------------------------------+
  ```
- [`keyring_key_store(key_id,
  key_type,
  key)`](keyring-functions-general-purpose.md#function_keyring-key-store)

  Obfuscates and stores a key in the keyring.

  Arguments:

  - *`key_id`*: A string that
    specifies the key ID.
  - *`key_type`*: A string that
    specifies the key type.
  - *`key`*: A string that
    specifies the key value.

  Return value:

  Returns 1 for success, or `NULL` and an
  error for failure.

  Example:

  ```sql
  mysql> SELECT keyring_key_store('new key', 'DSA', 'My key value');
  +-----------------------------------------------------+
  | keyring_key_store('new key', 'DSA', 'My key value') |
  +-----------------------------------------------------+
  |                                                   1 |
  +-----------------------------------------------------+
  ```
