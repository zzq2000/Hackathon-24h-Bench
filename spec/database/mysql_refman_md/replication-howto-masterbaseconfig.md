#### 19.1.2.1 Setting the Replication Source Configuration

To configure a source to use binary log file position based
replication, you must ensure that binary logging is enabled, and
establish a unique server ID.

Each server within a replication topology must be configured
with a unique server ID, which you can specify using the
[`server_id`](replication-options.md#sysvar_server_id) system variable. This
server ID is used to identify individual servers within the
replication topology, and must be a positive integer between 1
and (232)−1. The default
[`server_id`](replication-options.md#sysvar_server_id) value from MySQL 8.0
is 1. You can change the
[`server_id`](replication-options.md#sysvar_server_id) value dynamically by
issuing a statement like this:

```sql
SET GLOBAL server_id = 2;
```

How you organize and select the server IDs is your choice, so
long as each server ID is different from every other server ID
in use by any other server in the replication topology. Note
that if a value of 0 (which was the default in earlier releases)
was set previously for the server ID, you must restart the
server to initialize the source with your new nonzero server ID.
Otherwise, a server restart is not needed when you change the
server ID, unless you make other configuration changes that
require it.

Binary logging is required on the source because the binary log
is the basis for replicating changes from the source to its
replicas. Binary logging is enabled by default (the
[`log_bin`](replication-options-binary-log.md#sysvar_log_bin) system variable is set
to ON). The [`--log-bin`](replication-options-binary-log.md#option_mysqld_log-bin) option
tells the server what base name to use for binary log files. It
is recommended that you specify this option to give the binary
log files a non-default base name, so that if the host name
changes, you can easily continue to use the same binary log file
names (see [Section B.3.7, “Known Issues in MySQL”](known-issues.md "B.3.7 Known Issues in MySQL")). If binary logging
was previously disabled on the source using the
[`--skip-log-bin`](replication-options-binary-log.md#option_mysqld_log-bin)
option, you must restart the server without this option to
enable it.

Note

The following options also have an impact on the source:

- For the greatest possible durability and consistency in a
  replication setup using
  [`InnoDB`](innodb-storage-engine.md "Chapter 17 The InnoDB Storage Engine") with transactions, you
  should use
  `innodb_flush_log_at_trx_commit=1` and
  `sync_binlog=1` in the source's
  `my.cnf` file.
- Ensure that the
  [`skip_networking`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_skip_networking) system
  variable is not enabled on the source. If networking has
  been disabled, the replica cannot communicate with the
  source and replication fails.
