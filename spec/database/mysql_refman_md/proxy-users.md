### 8.2.19 Proxy Users

The MySQL server authenticates client connections using
authentication plugins. The plugin that authenticates a given
connection may request that the connecting (external) user be
treated as a different user for privilege-checking purposes. This
enables the external user to be a proxy for the second user; that
is, to assume the privileges of the second user:

- The external user is a “proxy user” (a user who
  can impersonate or become known as another user).
- The second user is a “proxied user” (a user whose
  identity and privileges can be assumed by a proxy user).

This section describes how the proxy user capability works. For
general information about authentication plugins, see
[Section 8.2.17, “Pluggable Authentication”](pluggable-authentication.md "8.2.17 Pluggable Authentication"). For information about
specific plugins, see [Section 8.4.1, “Authentication Plugins”](authentication-plugins.md "8.4.1 Authentication Plugins").

Note

One administrative benefit to be gained by proxying is that the
DBA can set up a single account with a set of privileges and
then enable multiple proxy users to have those privileges
without having to assign the privileges individually to each of
those users. As an alternative to proxy users, DBAs may find
that roles provide a suitable way to map users onto specific
sets of named privileges. Each user can be granted a given
single role to, in effect, be granted the appropriate set of
privileges. See [Section 8.2.10, “Using Roles”](roles.md "8.2.10 Using Roles").

#### Requirements for Proxy User Support

For proxying to occur for a given authentication plugin, these
conditions must be satisfied:

- Proxying must be supported, either by the plugin itself, or
  by the MySQL server on behalf of the plugin. In the latter
  case, server support may need to be enabled explicitly; see
  [Server Support for Proxy User Mapping](proxy-users.md#proxy-users-server-user-mapping "Server Support for Proxy User Mapping").
- The account for the external proxy user must be set up to be
  authenticated by the plugin. Use the
  [`CREATE USER`](create-user.md "15.7.1.3 CREATE USER Statement") statement to
  associate an account with an authentication plugin, or
  [`ALTER USER`](alter-user.md "15.7.1.1 ALTER USER Statement") to change its
  plugin.
- The account for the proxied user must exist and be granted
  the privileges to be assumed by the proxy user. Use the
  [`CREATE USER`](create-user.md "15.7.1.3 CREATE USER Statement") and
  [`GRANT`](grant.md "15.7.1.6 GRANT Statement") statements for this.
- Normally, the proxied user is configured so that it can be
  used only in proxying scenarios and not for direct logins.
- The proxy user account must have the
  [`PROXY`](privileges-provided.md#priv_proxy) privilege for the
  proxied account. Use the
  [`GRANT`](grant.md "15.7.1.6 GRANT Statement") statement for this.
- For a client connecting to the proxy account to be treated
  as a proxy user, the authentication plugin must return a
  user name different from the client user name, to indicate
  the user name of the proxied account that defines the
  privileges to be assumed by the proxy user.

  Alternatively, for plugins that are provided proxy mapping
  by the server, the proxied user is determined from the
  [`PROXY`](privileges-provided.md#priv_proxy) privilege held by the
  proxy user.

The proxy mechanism permits mapping only the external client
user name to the proxied user name. There is no provision for
mapping host names:

- When a client connects to the server, the server determines
  the proper account based on the user name passed by the
  client program and the host from which the client connects.
- If that account is a proxy account, the server attempts to
  determine the appropriate proxied account by finding a match
  for a proxied account using the user name returned by the
  authentication plugin and the host name of the proxy
  account. The host name in the proxied account is ignored.

#### Simple Proxy User Example

Consider the following account definitions:

```sql
-- create proxy account
CREATE USER 'employee_ext'@'localhost'
  IDENTIFIED WITH my_auth_plugin
  AS 'my_auth_string';

-- create proxied account and grant its privileges;
-- use mysql_no_login plugin to prevent direct login
CREATE USER 'employee'@'localhost'
  IDENTIFIED WITH mysql_no_login;
GRANT ALL
  ON employees.*
  TO 'employee'@'localhost';

-- grant to proxy account the
-- PROXY privilege for proxied account
GRANT PROXY
  ON 'employee'@'localhost'
  TO 'employee_ext'@'localhost';
```

When a client connects as `employee_ext` from
the local host, MySQL uses the plugin named
`my_auth_plugin` to perform authentication.
Suppose that `my_auth_plugin` returns a user
name of `employee` to the server, based on the
content of
`'my_auth_string'`
and perhaps by consulting some external authentication system.
The name `employee` differs from
`employee_ext`, so returning
`employee` serves as a request to the server to
treat the `employee_ext` external user, for
purposes of privilege checking, as the
`employee` local user.

In this case, `employee_ext` is the proxy user
and `employee` is the proxied user.

The server verifies that proxy authentication for
`employee` is possible for the
`employee_ext` user by checking whether
`employee_ext` (the proxy user) has the
[`PROXY`](privileges-provided.md#priv_proxy) privilege for
`employee` (the proxied user). If this
privilege has not been granted, an error occurs. Otherwise,
`employee_ext` assumes the privileges of
`employee`. The server checks statements
executed during the client session by
`employee_ext` against the privileges granted
to `employee`. In this case,
`employee_ext` can access tables in the
`employees` database.

The proxied account, `employee`, uses the
`mysql_no_login` authentication plugin to
prevent clients from using the account to log in directly. (This
assumes that the plugin is installed. For instructions, see
[Section 8.4.1.9, “No-Login Pluggable Authentication”](no-login-pluggable-authentication.md "8.4.1.9 No-Login Pluggable Authentication").) For
alternative methods of protecting proxied accounts against
direct use, see
[Preventing Direct Login to Proxied Accounts](proxy-users.md#preventing-proxied-account-direct-login "Preventing Direct Login to Proxied Accounts").

When proxying occurs, the [`USER()`](information-functions.md#function_user)
and [`CURRENT_USER()`](information-functions.md#function_current-user) functions can
be used to see the difference between the connecting user (the
proxy user) and the account whose privileges apply during the
current session (the proxied user). For the example just
described, those functions return these values:

```sql
mysql> SELECT USER(), CURRENT_USER();
+------------------------+--------------------+
| USER()                 | CURRENT_USER()     |
+------------------------+--------------------+
| employee_ext@localhost | employee@localhost |
+------------------------+--------------------+
```

In the [`CREATE USER`](create-user.md "15.7.1.3 CREATE USER Statement") statement that
creates the proxy user account, the `IDENTIFIED
WITH` clause that names the proxy-supporting
authentication plugin is optionally followed by an `AS
'auth_string'` clause
specifying a string that the server passes to the plugin when
the user connects. If present, the string provides information
that helps the plugin determine how to map the proxy (external)
client user name to a proxied user name. It is up to each plugin
whether it requires the `AS` clause. If so, the
format of the authentication string depends on how the plugin
intends to use it. Consult the documentation for a given plugin
for information about the authentication string values it
accepts.

#### Preventing Direct Login to Proxied Accounts

Proxied accounts generally are intended to be used only by means
of proxy accounts. That is, clients connect using a proxy
account, then are mapped onto and assume the privileges of the
appropriate proxied user.

There are multiple ways to ensure that a proxied account cannot
be used directly:

- Associate the account with the
  `mysql_no_login` authentication plugin. In
  this case, the account cannot be used for direct logins
  under any circumstances. This assumes that the plugin is
  installed. For instructions, see
  [Section 8.4.1.9, “No-Login Pluggable Authentication”](no-login-pluggable-authentication.md "8.4.1.9 No-Login Pluggable Authentication").
- Include the `ACCOUNT LOCK` option when you
  create the account. See [Section 15.7.1.3, “CREATE USER Statement”](create-user.md "15.7.1.3 CREATE USER Statement"). With
  this method, also include a password so that if the account
  is unlocked later, it cannot be accessed with no password.
  (If the `validate_password` component is
  enabled, creating an account without a password is not
  permitted, even if the account is locked. See
  [Section 8.4.3, “The Password Validation Component”](validate-password.md "8.4.3 The Password Validation Component").)
- Create the account with a password but do not tell anyone
  else the password. If you do not let anyone know the
  password for the account, clients cannot use it to connect
  directly to the MySQL server.

#### Granting and Revoking the PROXY Privilege

The [`PROXY`](privileges-provided.md#priv_proxy) privilege is needed to
enable an external user to connect as and have the privileges of
another user. To grant this privilege, use the
[`GRANT`](grant.md "15.7.1.6 GRANT Statement") statement. For example:

```sql
GRANT PROXY ON 'proxied_user' TO 'proxy_user';
```

The statement creates a row in the
`mysql.proxies_priv` grant table.

At connect time, *`proxy_user`* must
represent a valid externally authenticated MySQL user, and
*`proxied_user`* must represent a valid
locally authenticated user. Otherwise, the connection attempt
fails.

The corresponding [`REVOKE`](revoke.md "15.7.1.8 REVOKE Statement") syntax
is:

```sql
REVOKE PROXY ON 'proxied_user' FROM 'proxy_user';
```

MySQL [`GRANT`](grant.md "15.7.1.6 GRANT Statement") and
[`REVOKE`](revoke.md "15.7.1.8 REVOKE Statement") syntax extensions work as
usual. Examples:

```sql
-- grant PROXY to multiple accounts
GRANT PROXY ON 'a' TO 'b', 'c', 'd';

-- revoke PROXY from multiple accounts
REVOKE PROXY ON 'a' FROM 'b', 'c', 'd';

-- grant PROXY to an account and enable the account to grant
-- PROXY to the proxied account
GRANT PROXY ON 'a' TO 'd' WITH GRANT OPTION;

-- grant PROXY to default proxy account
GRANT PROXY ON 'a' TO ''@'';
```

The [`PROXY`](privileges-provided.md#priv_proxy) privilege can be
granted in these cases:

- By a user that has `GRANT PROXY ... WITH GRANT
  OPTION` for
  *`proxied_user`*.
- By *`proxied_user`* for itself: The
  value of [`USER()`](information-functions.md#function_user) must exactly
  match [`CURRENT_USER()`](information-functions.md#function_current-user) and
  *`proxied_user`*, for both the user
  name and host name parts of the account name.

The initial `root` account created during MySQL
installation has the
[`PROXY ... WITH GRANT
OPTION`](privileges-provided.md#priv_proxy) privilege for `''@''`, that
is, for all users and all hosts. This enables
`root` to set up proxy users, as well as to
delegate to other accounts the authority to set up proxy users.
For example, `root` can do this:

```sql
CREATE USER 'admin'@'localhost'
  IDENTIFIED BY 'admin_password';
GRANT PROXY
  ON ''@''
  TO 'admin'@'localhost'
  WITH GRANT OPTION;
```

Those statements create an `admin` user that
can manage all `GRANT PROXY` mappings. For
example, `admin` can do this:

```sql
GRANT PROXY ON sally TO joe;
```

#### Default Proxy Users

To specify that some or all users should connect using a given
authentication plugin, create a “blank” MySQL
account with an empty user name and host name
(`''@''`), associate it with that plugin, and
let the plugin return the real authenticated user name (if
different from the blank user). Suppose that there exists a
plugin named `ldap_auth` that implements LDAP
authentication and maps connecting users onto either a developer
or manager account. To set up proxying of users onto these
accounts, use the following statements:

```sql
-- create default proxy account
CREATE USER ''@''
  IDENTIFIED WITH ldap_auth
  AS 'O=Oracle, OU=MySQL';

-- create proxied accounts; use
-- mysql_no_login plugin to prevent direct login
CREATE USER 'developer'@'localhost'
  IDENTIFIED WITH mysql_no_login;
CREATE USER 'manager'@'localhost'
  IDENTIFIED WITH mysql_no_login;

-- grant to default proxy account the
-- PROXY privilege for proxied accounts
GRANT PROXY
  ON 'manager'@'localhost'
  TO ''@'';
GRANT PROXY
  ON 'developer'@'localhost'
  TO ''@'';
```

Now assume that a client connects as follows:

```terminal
$> mysql --user=myuser --password ...
Enter password: myuser_password
```

The server does not find `myuser` defined as a
MySQL user, but because there is a blank user account
(`''@''`) that matches the client user name and
host name, the server authenticates the client against that
account. The server invokes the `ldap_auth`
authentication plugin and passes `myuser` and
*`myuser_password`* to it as the user
name and password.

If the `ldap_auth` plugin finds in the LDAP
directory that *`myuser_password`* is not
the correct password for `myuser`,
authentication fails and the server rejects the connection.

If the password is correct and `ldap_auth`
finds that `myuser` is a developer, it returns
the user name `developer` to the MySQL server,
rather than `myuser`. Returning a user name
different from the client user name of `myuser`
signals to the server that it should treat
`myuser` as a proxy. The server verifies that
`''@''` can authenticate as
`developer` (because `''@''`
has the [`PROXY`](privileges-provided.md#priv_proxy) privilege to do so)
and accepts the connection. The session proceeds with
`myuser` having the privileges of the
`developer` proxied user. (These privileges
should be set up by the DBA using
[`GRANT`](grant.md "15.7.1.6 GRANT Statement") statements, not shown.) The
[`USER()`](information-functions.md#function_user) and
[`CURRENT_USER()`](information-functions.md#function_current-user) functions return
these values:

```sql
mysql> SELECT USER(), CURRENT_USER();
+------------------+---------------------+
| USER()           | CURRENT_USER()      |
+------------------+---------------------+
| myuser@localhost | developer@localhost |
+------------------+---------------------+
```

If the plugin instead finds in the LDAP directory that
`myuser` is a manager, it returns
`manager` as the user name and the session
proceeds with `myuser` having the privileges of
the `manager` proxied user.

```sql
mysql> SELECT USER(), CURRENT_USER();
+------------------+-------------------+
| USER()           | CURRENT_USER()    |
+------------------+-------------------+
| myuser@localhost | manager@localhost |
+------------------+-------------------+
```

For simplicity, external authentication cannot be multilevel:
Neither the credentials for `developer` nor
those for `manager` are taken into account in
the preceding example. However, they are still used if a client
tries to connect and authenticate directly as the
`developer` or `manager`
account, which is why those proxied accounts should be protected
against direct login (see
[Preventing Direct Login to Proxied Accounts](proxy-users.md#preventing-proxied-account-direct-login "Preventing Direct Login to Proxied Accounts")).

#### Default Proxy User and Anonymous User Conflicts

If you intend to create a default proxy user, check for other
existing “match any user” accounts that take
precedence over the default proxy user because they can prevent
that user from working as intended.

In the preceding discussion, the default proxy user account has
`''` in the host part, which matches any host.
If you set up a default proxy user, take care to also check
whether nonproxy accounts exist with the same user part and
`'%'` in the host part, because
`'%'` also matches any host, but has precedence
over `''` by the rules that the server uses to
sort account rows internally (see
[Section 8.2.6, “Access Control, Stage 1: Connection Verification”](connection-access.md "8.2.6 Access Control, Stage 1: Connection Verification")).

Suppose that a MySQL installation includes these two accounts:

```sql
-- create default proxy account
CREATE USER ''@''
  IDENTIFIED WITH some_plugin
  AS 'some_auth_string';
-- create anonymous account
CREATE USER ''@'%'
  IDENTIFIED BY 'anon_user_password';
```

The first account (`''@''`) is intended as the
default proxy user, used to authenticate connections for users
who do not otherwise match a more-specific account. The second
account (`''@'%'`) is an anonymous-user
account, which might have been created, for example, to enable
users without their own account to connect anonymously.

Both accounts have the same user part (`''`),
which matches any user. And each account has a host part that
matches any host. Nevertheless, there is a priority in account
matching for connection attempts because the matching rules sort
a host of `'%'` ahead of `''`.
For accounts that do not match any more-specific account, the
server attempts to authenticate them against
`''@'%'` (the anonymous user) rather than
`''@''` (the default proxy user). As a result,
the default proxy account is never used.

To avoid this problem, use one of the following strategies:

- Remove the anonymous account so that it does not conflict
  with the default proxy user.
- Use a more-specific default proxy user that matches ahead of
  the anonymous user. For example, to permit only
  `localhost` proxy connections, use
  `''@'localhost'`:

  ```sql
  CREATE USER ''@'localhost'
    IDENTIFIED WITH some_plugin
    AS 'some_auth_string';
  ```

  In addition, modify any `GRANT PROXY`
  statements to name `''@'localhost'` rather
  than `''@''` as the proxy user.

  Be aware that this strategy prevents anonymous-user
  connections from `localhost`.
- Use a named default account rather than an anonymous default
  account. For an example of this technique, consult the
  instructions for using the
  `authentication_windows` plugin. See
  [Section 8.4.1.6, “Windows Pluggable Authentication”](windows-pluggable-authentication.md "8.4.1.6 Windows Pluggable Authentication").
- Create multiple proxy users, one for local connections and
  one for “everything else” (remote connections).
  This can be useful particularly when local users should have
  different privileges from remote users.

  Create the proxy users:

  ```sql
  -- create proxy user for local connections
  CREATE USER ''@'localhost'
    IDENTIFIED WITH some_plugin
    AS 'some_auth_string';
  -- create proxy user for remote connections
  CREATE USER ''@'%'
    IDENTIFIED WITH some_plugin
    AS 'some_auth_string';
  ```

  Create the proxied users:

  ```sql
  -- create proxied user for local connections
  CREATE USER 'developer'@'localhost'
    IDENTIFIED WITH mysql_no_login;
  -- create proxied user for remote connections
  CREATE USER 'developer'@'%'
    IDENTIFIED WITH mysql_no_login;
  ```

  Grant to each proxy account the
  [`PROXY`](privileges-provided.md#priv_proxy) privilege for the
  corresponding proxied account:

  ```sql
  GRANT PROXY
    ON 'developer'@'localhost'
    TO ''@'localhost';
  GRANT PROXY
    ON 'developer'@'%'
    TO ''@'%';
  ```

  Finally, grant appropriate privileges to the local and
  remote proxied users (not shown).

  Assume that the
  `some_plugin`/`'some_auth_string'`
  combination causes `some_plugin` to map the
  client user name to `developer`. Local
  connections match the `''@'localhost'`
  proxy user, which maps to the
  `'developer'@'localhost'` proxied user.
  Remote connections match the `''@'%'` proxy
  user, which maps to the `'developer'@'%'`
  proxied user.

#### Server Support for Proxy User Mapping

Some authentication plugins implement proxy user mapping for
themselves (for example, the PAM and Windows authentication
plugins). Other authentication plugins do not support proxy
users by default. Of these, some can request that the MySQL
server itself map proxy users according to granted proxy
privileges: `mysql_native_password`,
`sha256_password`. If the
[`check_proxy_users`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_check_proxy_users) system
variable is enabled, the server performs proxy user mapping for
any authentication plugins that make such a request:

- By default,
  [`check_proxy_users`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_check_proxy_users) is
  disabled, so the server performs no proxy user mapping even
  for authentication plugins that request server support for
  proxy users.
- If [`check_proxy_users`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_check_proxy_users) is
  enabled, it may also be necessary to enable a
  plugin-specific system variable to take advantage of server
  proxy user mapping support:

  - For the `mysql_native_password` plugin,
    enable
    [`mysql_native_password_proxy_users`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_mysql_native_password_proxy_users).
  - For the `sha256_password` plugin,
    enable
    [`sha256_password_proxy_users`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_sha256_password_proxy_users).

For example, to enable all the preceding capabilities, start the
server with these lines in the `my.cnf` file:

```ini
[mysqld]
check_proxy_users=ON
mysql_native_password_proxy_users=ON
sha256_password_proxy_users=ON
```

Assuming that the relevant system variables have been enabled,
create the proxy user as usual using [`CREATE
USER`](create-user.md "15.7.1.3 CREATE USER Statement"), then grant it the
[`PROXY`](privileges-provided.md#priv_proxy) privilege to a single other
account to be treated as the proxied user. When the server
receives a successful connection request for the proxy user, it
finds that the user has the [`PROXY`](privileges-provided.md#priv_proxy)
privilege and uses it to determine the proper proxied user.

```sql
-- create proxy account
CREATE USER 'proxy_user'@'localhost'
  IDENTIFIED WITH mysql_native_password
  BY 'password';

-- create proxied account and grant its privileges;
-- use mysql_no_login plugin to prevent direct login
CREATE USER 'proxied_user'@'localhost'
  IDENTIFIED WITH mysql_no_login;
-- grant privileges to proxied account
GRANT ...
  ON ...
  TO 'proxied_user'@'localhost';

-- grant to proxy account the
-- PROXY privilege for proxied account
GRANT PROXY
  ON 'proxied_user'@'localhost'
  TO 'proxy_user'@'localhost';
```

To use the proxy account, connect to the server using its name
and password:

```terminal
$> mysql -u proxy_user -p
Enter password: (enter proxy_user password here)
```

Authentication succeeds, the server finds that
`proxy_user` has the
[`PROXY`](privileges-provided.md#priv_proxy) privilege for
`proxied_user`, and the session proceeds with
`proxy_user` having the privileges of
`proxied_user`.

Proxy user mapping performed by the server is subject to these
restrictions:

- The server does not proxy to or from an anonymous user, even
  if the associated [`PROXY`](privileges-provided.md#priv_proxy)
  privilege is granted.
- When a single account has been granted proxy privileges for
  more than one proxied account, server proxy user mapping is
  nondeterministic. Therefore, granting to a single account
  proxy privileges for multiple proxied accounts is
  discouraged.

#### Proxy User System Variables

Two system variables help trace the proxy login process:

- [`proxy_user`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_proxy_user): This value is
  `NULL` if proxying is not used. Otherwise,
  it indicates the proxy user account. For example, if a
  client authenticates through the `''@''`
  proxy account, this variable is set as follows:

  ```sql
  mysql> SELECT @@proxy_user;
  +--------------+
  | @@proxy_user |
  +--------------+
  | ''@''        |
  +--------------+
  ```
- [`external_user`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_external_user): Sometimes
  the authentication plugin may use an external user to
  authenticate to the MySQL server. For example, when using
  Windows native authentication, a plugin that authenticates
  using the windows API does not need the login ID passed to
  it. However, it still uses a Windows user ID to
  authenticate. The plugin may return this external user ID
  (or the first 512 UTF-8 bytes of it) to the server using the
  `external_user` read-only session variable.
  If the plugin does not set this variable, its value is
  `NULL`.
