#### 7.1.13.3 Connecting Using the IPv6 Local Host Address

The following procedure shows how to configure MySQL to permit
IPv6 connections by clients that connect to the local server
using the `::1` local host address. The
instructions given here assume that your system supports IPv6.

1. Start the MySQL server with an appropriate
   [`bind_address`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_bind_address) setting to
   permit it to accept IPv6 connections. For example, put the
   following lines in the server option file and restart the
   server:

   ```ini
   [mysqld]
   bind_address = *
   ```

   Specifying \* (or `::`) as the value for
   [`bind_address`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_bind_address) permits both
   IPv4 and IPv6 connections on all server host IPv4 and IPv6
   interfaces. If you want to bind the server to a specific
   list of addresses, you can do this as of MySQL 8.0.13 by
   specifying a comma-separated list of values for
   [`bind_address`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_bind_address). This example
   specifies the local host addresses for both IPv4 and IPv6:

   ```ini
   [mysqld]
   bind_address = 127.0.0.1,::1
   ```

   For more information, see the
   [`bind_address`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_bind_address) description in
   [Section 7.1.8, “Server System Variables”](server-system-variables.md "7.1.8 Server System Variables").
2. As an administrator, connect to the server and create an
   account for a local user who can connect from the
   `::1` local IPv6 host address:

   ```sql
   mysql> CREATE USER 'ipv6user'@'::1' IDENTIFIED BY 'ipv6pass';
   ```

   For the permitted syntax of IPv6 addresses in account names,
   see [Section 8.2.4, “Specifying Account Names”](account-names.md "8.2.4 Specifying Account Names"). In addition to the
   [`CREATE USER`](create-user.md "15.7.1.3 CREATE USER Statement") statement, you
   can issue [`GRANT`](grant.md "15.7.1.6 GRANT Statement") statements
   that give specific privileges to the account, although that
   is not necessary for the remaining steps in this procedure.
3. Invoke the [**mysql**](mysql.md "6.5.1 mysql — The MySQL Command-Line Client") client to connect to the
   server using the new account:

   ```terminal
   $> mysql -h ::1 -u ipv6user -pipv6pass
   ```
4. Try some simple statements that show connection information:

   ```sql
   mysql> STATUS
   ...
   Connection:   ::1 via TCP/IP
   ...

   mysql> SELECT CURRENT_USER(), @@bind_address;
   +----------------+----------------+
   | CURRENT_USER() | @@bind_address |
   +----------------+----------------+
   | ipv6user@::1   | ::             |
   +----------------+----------------+
   ```
