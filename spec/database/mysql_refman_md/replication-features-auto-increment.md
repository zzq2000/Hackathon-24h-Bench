#### 19.5.1.1 Replication and AUTO\_INCREMENT

Statement-based replication of
`AUTO_INCREMENT`,
[`LAST_INSERT_ID()`](information-functions.md#function_last-insert-id), and
[`TIMESTAMP`](datetime.md "13.2.2 The DATE, DATETIME, and TIMESTAMP Types") values is carried out
subject to the following exceptions:

- A statement invoking a trigger or function that causes an
  update to an `AUTO_INCREMENT` column is not
  replicated correctly using statement-based replication.
  These statements are marked as unsafe. (Bug #45677)
- An [`INSERT`](insert.md "15.2.7 INSERT Statement") into a table that
  has a composite primary key that includes an
  `AUTO_INCREMENT` column that is not the
  first column of this composite key is not safe for
  statement-based logging or replication. These statements are
  marked as unsafe. (Bug #11754117, Bug #45670)

  This issue does not affect tables using the
  [`InnoDB`](innodb-storage-engine.md "Chapter 17 The InnoDB Storage Engine") storage engine, since an
  `InnoDB` table with an
  [AUTO\_INCREMENT](glossary.md#glos_auto_increment "auto-increment")
  column requires at least one key where the auto-increment
  column is the only or leftmost column.
- Adding an `AUTO_INCREMENT` column to a
  table with [`ALTER TABLE`](alter-table.md "15.1.9 ALTER TABLE Statement") might
  not produce the same ordering of the rows on the replica and
  the source. This occurs because the order in which the rows
  are numbered depends on the specific storage engine used for
  the table and the order in which the rows were inserted. If
  it is important to have the same order on the source and
  replica, the rows must be ordered before assigning an
  `AUTO_INCREMENT` number. Assuming that you
  want to add an `AUTO_INCREMENT` column to a
  table `t1` that has columns
  `col1` and `col2`, the
  following statements produce a new table
  `t2` identical to `t1` but
  with an `AUTO_INCREMENT` column:

  ```sql
  CREATE TABLE t2 LIKE t1;
  ALTER TABLE t2 ADD id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY;
  INSERT INTO t2 SELECT * FROM t1 ORDER BY col1, col2;
  ```

  Important

  To guarantee the same ordering on both source and replica,
  the `ORDER BY` clause must name
  *all* columns of `t1`.

  The instructions just given are subject to the limitations
  of [`CREATE
  TABLE ... LIKE`](create-table-like.md "15.1.20.3 CREATE TABLE ... LIKE Statement"): Foreign key definitions are
  ignored, as are the `DATA DIRECTORY` and
  `INDEX DIRECTORY` table options. If a table
  definition includes any of those characteristics, create
  `t2` using a [`CREATE
  TABLE`](create-table.md "15.1.20 CREATE TABLE Statement") statement that is identical to the one used
  to create `t1`, but with the addition of
  the `AUTO_INCREMENT` column.

  Regardless of the method used to create and populate the
  copy having the `AUTO_INCREMENT` column,
  the final step is to drop the original table and then rename
  the copy:

  ```sql
  DROP t1;
  ALTER TABLE t2 RENAME t1;
  ```
