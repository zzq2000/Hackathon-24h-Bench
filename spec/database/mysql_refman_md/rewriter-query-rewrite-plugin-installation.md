#### 7.6.4.1 Installing or Uninstalling the Rewriter Query Rewrite Plugin

Note

If installed, the `Rewriter` plugin involves
some overhead even when disabled. To avoid this overhead, do
not install the plugin unless you plan to use it.

To install or uninstall the `Rewriter` query
rewrite plugin, choose the appropriate script located in the
`share` directory of your MySQL installation:

- `install_rewriter.sql`: Choose this
  script to install the `Rewriter` plugin and
  its associated elements.
- `uninstall_rewriter.sql`: Choose this
  script to uninstall the `Rewriter` plugin
  and its associated elements.

Run the chosen script as follows:

```terminal
$> mysql -u root -p < install_rewriter.sql
Enter password: (enter root password here)
```

The example here uses the
`install_rewriter.sql` installation script.
Substitute `uninstall_rewriter.sql` if you
are uninstalling the plugin.

Running an installation script should install and enable the
plugin. To verify that, connect to the server and execute this
statement:

```sql
mysql> SHOW GLOBAL VARIABLES LIKE 'rewriter_enabled';
+------------------+-------+
| Variable_name    | Value |
+------------------+-------+
| rewriter_enabled | ON    |
+------------------+-------+
```
