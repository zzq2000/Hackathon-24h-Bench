#### 8.4.5.12 Audit Log Restrictions

MySQL Enterprise Audit is subject to these general restrictions:

- Only SQL statements are logged. Changes made by no-SQL APIs,
  such as memcached, Node.JS, and the NDB API, are not logged.
- Only top-level statements are logged, not statements within
  stored programs such as triggers or stored procedures.
- Contents of files referenced by statements such as
  [`LOAD DATA`](load-data.md "15.2.9 LOAD DATA Statement") are not logged.

**NDB Cluster.**
It is possible to use MySQL Enterprise Audit with MySQL NDB Cluster,
subject to the following conditions:

- All changes to be logged must be done using the SQL
  interface. Changes using no-SQL interfaces, such as those
  provided by the NDB API, memcached, or ClusterJ, are not
  logged.
- The plugin must be installed on each MySQL server that is
  used to execute SQL on the cluster.
- Audit plugin data must be aggregated amongst all MySQL
  servers used with the cluster. This aggregation is the
  responsibility of the application or user.
