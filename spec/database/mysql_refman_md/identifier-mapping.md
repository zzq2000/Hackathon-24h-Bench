### 11.2.4 Mapping of Identifiers to File Names

There is a correspondence between database and table identifiers
and names in the file system. For the basic structure, MySQL
represents each database as a directory in the data directory,
and depending upon the storage engine, each table may be
represented by one or more files in the appropriate database
directory.

For the data and index files, the exact representation on disk
is storage engine specific. These files may be stored in the
database directory, or the information may be stored in a
separate file. `InnoDB` data is stored in the
InnoDB data files. If you are using tablespaces with
`InnoDB`, then the specific tablespace files
you create are used instead.

Any character is legal in database or table identifiers except
ASCII NUL (`X'00'`). MySQL encodes any
characters that are problematic in the corresponding file system
objects when it creates database directories or table files:

- Basic Latin letters (`a..zA..Z`), digits
  (`0..9`) and underscore
  (`_`) are encoded as is. Consequently,
  their case sensitivity directly depends on file system
  features.
- All other national letters from alphabets that have
  uppercase/lowercase mapping are encoded as shown in the
  following table. Values in the Code Range column are UCS-2
  values.

  | Code Range | Pattern | Number | Used | Unused | Blocks |
  | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
  | 00C0..017F | [@][0..4][g..z] | 5\*20= 100 | 97 | 3 | Latin-1 Supplement + Latin Extended-A |
  | 0370..03FF | [@][5..9][g..z] | 5\*20= 100 | 88 | 12 | Greek and Coptic |
  | 0400..052F | [@][g..z][0..6] | 20\*7= 140 | 137 | 3 | Cyrillic + Cyrillic Supplement |
  | 0530..058F | [@][g..z][7..8] | 20\*2= 40 | 38 | 2 | Armenian |
  | 2160..217F | [@][g..z][9] | 20\*1= 20 | 16 | 4 | Number Forms |
  | 0180..02AF | [@][g..z][a..k] | 20\*11=220 | 203 | 17 | Latin Extended-B + IPA Extensions |
  | 1E00..1EFF | [@][g..z][l..r] | 20\*7= 140 | 136 | 4 | Latin Extended Additional |
  | 1F00..1FFF | [@][g..z][s..z] | 20\*8= 160 | 144 | 16 | Greek Extended |
  | .... .... | [@][a..f][g..z] | 6\*20= 120 | 0 | 120 | RESERVED |
  | 24B6..24E9 | [@][@][a..z] | 26 | 26 | 0 | Enclosed Alphanumerics |
  | FF21..FF5A | [@][a..z][@] | 26 | 26 | 0 | Halfwidth and Fullwidth forms |

  One of the bytes in the sequence encodes lettercase. For
  example: `LATIN CAPITAL LETTER A WITH
  GRAVE` is encoded as `@0G`,
  whereas `LATIN SMALL LETTER A WITH GRAVE`
  is encoded as `@0g`. Here the third byte
  (`G` or `g`) indicates
  lettercase. (On a case-insensitive file system, both letters
  are treated as the same.)

  For some blocks, such as Cyrillic, the second byte
  determines lettercase. For other blocks, such as Latin1
  Supplement, the third byte determines lettercase. If two
  bytes in the sequence are letters (as in Greek Extended),
  the leftmost letter character stands for lettercase. All
  other letter bytes must be in lowercase.
- All nonletter characters except underscore
  (`_`), as well as letters from alphabets
  that do not have uppercase/lowercase mapping (such as
  Hebrew) are encoded using hexadecimal representation using
  lowercase letters for hexadecimal digits
  `a..f`:

  ```clike
  0x003F -> @003f
  0xFFFF -> @ffff
  ```

  The hexadecimal values correspond to character values in the
  `ucs2` double-byte character set.

On Windows, some names such as `nul`,
`prn`, and `aux` are encoded
by appending `@@@` to the name when the server
creates the corresponding file or directory. This occurs on all
platforms for portability of the corresponding database object
between platforms.

The following names are reserved and appended with
`@@@` if used in schema or table names:

- CON
- PRN
- AUX
- NUL
- COM1 through COM9
- LPT1 through LPT9

CLOCK$ is also a member of this group of reserved names, but is
not appended with `@@@`, but
`@0024` instead. That is, if CLOCK$ is used as
a schema or table name, it is written to the file system as
`CLOCK@0024`. The same is true for any use of
$ (dollar sign) in a schema or table name; it is replaced with
`@0024` on the filesystem.

Note

These names are also written to
[`INNODB_TABLES`](information-schema-innodb-tables-table.md "28.4.23 The INFORMATION_SCHEMA INNODB_TABLES Table") in their appended
forms, but are written to [`TABLES`](information-schema-tables-table.md "28.3.38 The INFORMATION_SCHEMA TABLES Table")
in their unappended form, as entered by the user.
