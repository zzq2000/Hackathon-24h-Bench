#### 20.5.1.3 Using Group Replication Group Write Consensus

This section explains how to inspect and configure the maximum
number of consensus instances at any time for a group. This
maximum is referred to as the event horizon for a group, and is
the maximum number of consensus instances that the group can
execute in parallel. This enables you to fine tune the
performance of your Group Replication deployment. For example,
the default value of 10 is suitable for a group running on a
LAN, but for groups operating over a slower network such as a
WAN, increase this number to improve performance.

##### Inspecting a Group's Write Concurrency

Use the
[`group_replication_get_write_concurrency()`](group-replication-functions-for-maximum-consensus.md#function_group-replication-get-write-concurrency)
function to inspect a group's event horizon value at runtime
by issuing:

```sql
SELECT group_replication_get_write_concurrency();
```

##### Configuring a Group's Write Concurrency

Use the
[`group_replication_set_write_concurrency()`](group-replication-functions-for-maximum-consensus.md#function_group-replication-set-write-concurrency)
function to set the maximum number of consensus instances that
the system can execute in parallel by issuing:

```sql
SELECT group_replication_set_write_concurrency(instances);
```

where *`instances`* is the new maximum
number of consensus instances. The
[`GROUP_REPLICATION_ADMIN`](privileges-provided.md#priv_group-replication-admin)
privilege is required to use this function.
