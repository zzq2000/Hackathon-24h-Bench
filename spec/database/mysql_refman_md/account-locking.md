### 8.2.20 Account Locking

MySQL supports locking and unlocking user accounts using the
`ACCOUNT LOCK` and `ACCOUNT
UNLOCK` clauses for the [`CREATE
USER`](create-user.md "15.7.1.3 CREATE USER Statement") and [`ALTER USER`](alter-user.md "15.7.1.1 ALTER USER Statement")
statements:

- When used with [`CREATE USER`](create-user.md "15.7.1.3 CREATE USER Statement"),
  these clauses specify the initial locking state for a new
  account. In the absence of either clause, the account is
  created in an unlocked state.

  If the `validate_password` component is
  enabled, creating an account without a password is not
  permitted, even if the account is locked. See
  [Section 8.4.3, “The Password Validation Component”](validate-password.md "8.4.3 The Password Validation Component").
- When used with [`ALTER USER`](alter-user.md "15.7.1.1 ALTER USER Statement"),
  these clauses specify the new locking state for an existing
  account. In the absence of either clause, the account locking
  state remains unchanged.

  As of MySQL 8.0.19,
  [`ALTER USER ...
  UNLOCK`](alter-user.md "15.7.1.1 ALTER USER Statement") unlocks any account named by the statement
  that is temporarily locked due to too many failed logins. See
  [Section 8.2.15, “Password Management”](password-management.md "8.2.15 Password Management").

Account locking state is recorded in the
`account_locked` column of the
`mysql.user` system table. The output from
[`SHOW CREATE USER`](show-create-user.md "15.7.7.12 SHOW CREATE USER Statement") indicates whether
an account is locked or unlocked.

If a client attempts to connect to a locked account, the attempt
fails. The server increments the
[`Locked_connects`](server-status-variables.md#statvar_Locked_connects) status variable
that indicates the number of attempts to connect to a locked
account, returns an
[`ER_ACCOUNT_HAS_BEEN_LOCKED`](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/mysql-errors/8.0/en/server-error-reference.html#error_er_account_has_been_locked) error,
and writes a message to the error log:

```none
Access denied for user 'user_name'@'host_name'.
Account is locked.
```

Locking an account does not affect being able to connect using a
proxy user that assumes the identity of the locked account. It
also does not affect the ability to execute stored programs or
views that have a `DEFINER` attribute naming the
locked account. That is, the ability to use a proxied account or
stored programs or views is not affected by locking the account.

The account-locking capability depends on the presence of the
`account_locked` column in the
`mysql.user` system table. For upgrades from
MySQL versions older than 5.7.6, perform the MySQL upgrade
procedure to ensure that this column exists. See
[Chapter 3, *Upgrading MySQL*](upgrading.md "Chapter 3 Upgrading MySQL"). For nonupgraded installations that
have no `account_locked` column, the server
treats all accounts as unlocked, and using the `ACCOUNT
LOCK` or `ACCOUNT UNLOCK` clauses
produces an error.
