### 10.15.10 Selecting Optimizer Features to Trace

Some features in the optimizer can be invoked many times during
statement optimization and execution, and thus can make the trace
grow beyond reason. They are:

- *Greedy search*: With an
  *`N`*-table join, this could explore
  factorial(*`N`*) plans.
- *Range optimizer*
- *Dynamic range optimization*: Shown as
  `range checked for each record` in
  [`EXPLAIN`](explain.md "15.8.2 EXPLAIN Statement") output; each outer row
  causes a re-run of the range optimizer.
- *Subqueries*: A subquery in which the
  `WHERE` clause may be executed once per row.

Those features can be excluded from tracing by setting one or more
switches of the
[`optimizer_trace_features`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_optimizer_trace_features) system
variable to `OFF`. These switches are listed
here:

- `greedy_search`: Greedy search is not traced.
- `range_optimizer`: The range optimizer is not
  traced.
- `dynamic_range`: Only the first call to the
  range optimizer on this
  `JOIN_TAB::SQL_SELECT` is traced.
- `repeated_subselect`: Only the first
  execution of this `Item_subselect` is traced.
