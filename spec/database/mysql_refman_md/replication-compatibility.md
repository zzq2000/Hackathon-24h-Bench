### 19.5.2 Replication Compatibility Between MySQL Versions

MySQL supports replication from one release series to the next
higher release series. For example, you can replicate from a
source running MySQL 5.6 to a replica running MySQL 5.7, from a
source running MySQL 5.7 to a replica running MySQL 8.0, and so
on. However, you might encounter difficulties when replicating
from an older source to a newer replica if the source uses
statements or relies on behavior no longer supported in the
version of MySQL used on the replica. For example, foreign key
names longer than 64 characters are no longer supported from MySQL
8.0.

The use of more than two MySQL Server versions is not supported in
replication setups involving multiple sources, regardless of the
number of source or replica MySQL servers. This restriction
applies not only to release series, but to version numbers within
the same release series as well. For example, if you are using a
chained or circular replication setup, you cannot use MySQL
8.0.22, MySQL 8.0.24, and MySQL
8.0.28 concurrently, although you could use any two
of these releases together.

Important

It is strongly recommended to use the most recent release
available within a given MySQL release series because
replication (and other) capabilities are continually being
improved. It is also recommended to upgrade sources and replicas
that use early releases of a release series of MySQL to GA
(production) releases when the latter become available for that
release series.

From MySQL 8.0.14, the server version is recorded in the binary
log for each transaction for the server that originally committed
the transaction
([`original_server_version`](replication-options-source.md#sysvar_original_server_version)), and
for the server that is the immediate source of the current server
in the replication topology
([`immediate_server_version`](replication-options-source.md#sysvar_immediate_server_version)).

Replication from newer sources to older replicas might be
possible, but is generally not supported. This is due to a number
of factors:

- **Binary log format changes.**
  The binary log format can change between major releases.
  While we attempt to maintain backward compatibility, this is
  not always possible. A source might also have optional
  features enabled that are not understood by older replicas,
  such as binary log transaction compression, where the
  resulting compressed transaction payloads cannot be read by
  a replica at a release before MySQL 8.0.20.

  This also has significant implications for upgrading
  replication servers; see
  [Section 19.5.3, “Upgrading a Replication Topology”](replication-upgrade.md "19.5.3 Upgrading a Replication Topology"), for more information.
- For more information about row-based replication, see
  [Section 19.2.1, “Replication Formats”](replication-formats.md "19.2.1 Replication Formats").
- **SQL incompatibilities.**
  You cannot replicate from a newer source to an older replica
  using statement-based replication if the statements to be
  replicated use SQL features available on the source but not
  on the replica.

  However, if both the source and the replica support row-based
  replication, and there are no data definition statements to be
  replicated that depend on SQL features found on the source but
  not on the replica, you can use row-based replication to
  replicate the effects of data modification statements even if
  the DDL run on the source is not supported on the replica.

In MySQL 8.0.26, incompatible changes were made to replication
instrumentation names, including the names of thread stages,
containing the terms “master”, which is changed to
“source”, “slave”, which is changed to
“replica”, and “mts” (for
“multithreaded slave”), which is changed to
“mta” (for “multithreaded applier”).
Monitoring tools that work with these instrumentation names might
be impacted. If the incompatible changes have an impact for you,
set the [`terminology_use_previous`](replication-options-replica.md#sysvar_terminology_use_previous)
system variable to `BEFORE_8_0_26` to make MySQL
Server use the old versions of the names for the objects specified
in the previous list. This enables monitoring tools that rely on
the old names to continue working until they can be updated to use
the new names.
