### 17.6.4 Doublewrite Buffer

The doublewrite buffer is a storage area where
`InnoDB` writes pages flushed from the buffer
pool before writing the pages to their proper positions in the
`InnoDB` data files. If there is an operating
system, storage subsystem, or unexpected [**mysqld**](mysqld.md "6.3.1 mysqld — The MySQL Server")
process exit in the middle of a page write,
`InnoDB` can find a good copy of the page from
the doublewrite buffer during crash recovery.

Although data is written twice, the doublewrite buffer does not
require twice as much I/O overhead or twice as many I/O
operations. Data is written to the doublewrite buffer in a large
sequential chunk, with a single `fsync()` call to
the operating system (except in the case that
`innodb_flush_method` is set to
`O_DIRECT_NO_FSYNC`).

Prior to MySQL 8.0.20, the doublewrite buffer storage area is
located in the `InnoDB` system tablespace. As of
MySQL 8.0.20, the doublewrite buffer storage area is located in
doublewrite files.

The following variables are provided for doublewrite buffer
configuration:

- [`innodb_doublewrite`](innodb-parameters.md#sysvar_innodb_doublewrite)

  The [`innodb_doublewrite`](innodb-parameters.md#sysvar_innodb_doublewrite)
  variable controls whether the doublewrite buffer is enabled.
  It is enabled by default in most cases. To disable the
  doublewrite buffer, set
  [`innodb_doublewrite`](innodb-parameters.md#sysvar_innodb_doublewrite) to
  `OFF`. Consider disabling the doublewrite
  buffer if you are more concerned with performance than data
  integrity, as may be the case when performing benchmarks, for
  example.

  From MySQL 8.0.30,
  [`innodb_doublewrite`](innodb-parameters.md#sysvar_innodb_doublewrite) supports
  `DETECT_AND_RECOVER` and
  `DETECT_ONLY` settings.

  The `DETECT_AND_RECOVER` setting is the same
  as the `ON` setting. With this setting, the
  doublewrite buffer is fully enabled, with database page
  content written to the doublewrite buffer where it is accessed
  during recovery to fix incomplete page writes.

  With the `DETECT_ONLY` setting, only metadata
  is written to the doublewrite buffer. Database page content is
  not written to the doublewrite buffer, and recovery does not
  use the doublewrite buffer to fix incomplete page writes. This
  lightweight setting is intended for detecting incomplete page
  writes only.

  MySQL 8.0.30 onwards supports dynamic changes to the
  [`innodb_doublewrite`](innodb-parameters.md#sysvar_innodb_doublewrite) setting
  that enables the doublewrite buffer, between
  `ON`, `DETECT_AND_RECOVER`,
  and `DETECT_ONLY`. MySQL does not support
  dynamic changes between a setting that enables the doublewrite
  buffer and `OFF` or vice versa.

  If the doublewrite buffer is located on a Fusion-io device
  that supports atomic writes, the doublewrite buffer is
  automatically disabled and data file writes are performed
  using Fusion-io atomic writes instead. However, be aware that
  the [`innodb_doublewrite`](innodb-parameters.md#sysvar_innodb_doublewrite)
  setting is global. When the doublewrite buffer is disabled, it
  is disabled for all data files including those that do not
  reside on Fusion-io hardware. This feature is only supported
  on Fusion-io hardware and is only enabled for Fusion-io NVMFS
  on Linux. To take full advantage of this feature, an
  [`innodb_flush_method`](innodb-parameters.md#sysvar_innodb_flush_method) setting
  of `O_DIRECT` is recommended.
- [`innodb_doublewrite_dir`](innodb-parameters.md#sysvar_innodb_doublewrite_dir)

  The [`innodb_doublewrite_dir`](innodb-parameters.md#sysvar_innodb_doublewrite_dir)
  variable (introduced in MySQL 8.0.20) defines the directory
  where `InnoDB` creates doublewrite files. If
  no directory is specified, doublewrite files are created in
  the [`innodb_data_home_dir`](innodb-parameters.md#sysvar_innodb_data_home_dir)
  directory, which defaults to the data directory if
  unspecified.

  A hash symbol '#' is automatically prefixed to the specified
  directory name to avoid conflicts with schema names. However,
  if a '.', '#'. or '/' prefix is specified explicitly in the
  directory name, the hash symbol '#' is not prefixed to the
  directory name.

  Ideally, the doublewrite directory should be placed on the
  fastest storage media available.
- [`innodb_doublewrite_files`](innodb-parameters.md#sysvar_innodb_doublewrite_files)

  The [`innodb_doublewrite_files`](innodb-parameters.md#sysvar_innodb_doublewrite_files)
  variable defines the number of doublewrite files. By default,
  two doublewrite files are created for each buffer pool
  instance: A flush list doublewrite file and an LRU list
  doublewrite file.

  The flush list doublewrite file is for pages flushed from the
  buffer pool flush list. The default size of a flush list
  doublewrite file is the `InnoDB` page size \*
  doublewrite page bytes.

  The LRU list doublewrite file is for pages flushed from the
  buffer pool LRU list. It also contains slots for single page
  flushes. The default size of an LRU list doublewrite file is
  the `InnoDB` page size \* (doublewrite pages +
  (512 / the number of buffer pool instances)) where 512 is the
  total number of slots reserved for single page flushes.

  At a minimum, there are two doublewrite files. The maximum
  number of doublewrite files is two times the number of buffer
  pool instances. (The number of buffer pool instances is
  controlled by the
  [`innodb_buffer_pool_instances`](innodb-parameters.md#sysvar_innodb_buffer_pool_instances)
  variable.)

  Doublewrite file names have the following format:
  `#ib_page_size_file_number.dblwr`
  (or `.bdblwr` with the
  `DETECT_ONLY` setting). For example, the
  following doublewrite files are created for a MySQL instance
  with an `InnoDB` pages size of 16KB and a
  single buffer pool:

  ```none
  #ib_16384_0.dblwr
  #ib_16384_1.dblwr
  ```

  The [`innodb_doublewrite_files`](innodb-parameters.md#sysvar_innodb_doublewrite_files)
  variable is intended for advanced performance tuning. The
  default setting should be suitable for most users.
- [`innodb_doublewrite_pages`](innodb-parameters.md#sysvar_innodb_doublewrite_pages)

  The [`innodb_doublewrite_pages`](innodb-parameters.md#sysvar_innodb_doublewrite_pages)
  variable (introduced in MySQL 8.0.20) controls the maximum
  number of doublewrite pages per thread. If no value is
  specified,
  [`innodb_doublewrite_pages`](innodb-parameters.md#sysvar_innodb_doublewrite_pages) is
  set to the
  [`innodb_write_io_threads`](innodb-parameters.md#sysvar_innodb_write_io_threads)
  value. This variable is intended for advanced performance
  tuning. The default value should be suitable for most users.

As of MySQL 8.0.23, `InnoDB` automatically
encrypts doublewrite file pages that belong to encrypted
tablespaces (see [Section 17.13, “InnoDB Data-at-Rest Encryption”](innodb-data-encryption.md "17.13 InnoDB Data-at-Rest Encryption")).
Likewise, doublewrite file pages belonging to page-compressed
tablespaces are compressed. As a result, doublewrite files can
contain different page types including unencrypted and
uncompressed pages, encrypted pages, compressed pages, and pages
that are both encrypted and compressed.
