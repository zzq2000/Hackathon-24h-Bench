### 27.2.1 Stored Routine Syntax

A stored routine is either a procedure or a function. Stored
routines are created with the [`CREATE
PROCEDURE`](create-procedure.md "15.1.17 CREATE PROCEDURE and CREATE FUNCTION Statements") and [`CREATE
FUNCTION`](create-function.md "15.1.14 CREATE FUNCTION Statement") statements (see
[Section 15.1.17, “CREATE PROCEDURE and CREATE FUNCTION Statements”](create-procedure.md "15.1.17 CREATE PROCEDURE and CREATE FUNCTION Statements")). A procedure is invoked using
a [`CALL`](call.md "15.2.1 CALL Statement") statement (see
[Section 15.2.1, “CALL Statement”](call.md "15.2.1 CALL Statement")), and can only pass back values using
output variables. A function can be called from inside a statement
just like any other function (that is, by invoking the function's
name), and can return a scalar value. The body of a stored routine
can use compound statements (see
[Section 15.6, “Compound Statement Syntax”](sql-compound-statements.md "15.6 Compound Statement Syntax")).

Stored routines can be dropped with the [`DROP
PROCEDURE`](drop-procedure.md "15.1.29 DROP PROCEDURE and DROP FUNCTION Statements") and [`DROP
FUNCTION`](drop-function.md "15.1.26 DROP FUNCTION Statement") statements (see
[Section 15.1.29, “DROP PROCEDURE and DROP FUNCTION Statements”](drop-procedure.md "15.1.29 DROP PROCEDURE and DROP FUNCTION Statements")), and altered with the
[`ALTER PROCEDURE`](alter-procedure.md "15.1.7 ALTER PROCEDURE Statement") and
[`ALTER FUNCTION`](alter-function.md "15.1.4 ALTER FUNCTION Statement") statements (see
[Section 15.1.7, “ALTER PROCEDURE Statement”](alter-procedure.md "15.1.7 ALTER PROCEDURE Statement")).

A stored procedure or function is associated with a particular
database. This has several implications:

- When the routine is invoked, an implicit `USE
  db_name` is performed (and
  undone when the routine terminates).
  [`USE`](use.md "15.8.4 USE Statement") statements within stored
  routines are not permitted.
- You can qualify routine names with the database name. This can
  be used to refer to a routine that is not in the current
  database. For example, to invoke a stored procedure
  `p` or function `f` that is
  associated with the `test` database, you can
  say `CALL test.p()` or
  `test.f()`.
- When a database is dropped, all stored routines associated
  with it are dropped as well.

Stored functions cannot be recursive.

Recursion in stored procedures is permitted but disabled by
default. To enable recursion, set the
[`max_sp_recursion_depth`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_max_sp_recursion_depth) server
system variable to a value greater than zero. Stored procedure
recursion increases the demand on thread stack space. If you
increase the value of
[`max_sp_recursion_depth`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_max_sp_recursion_depth), it may be
necessary to increase thread stack size by increasing the value of
[`thread_stack`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_thread_stack) at server startup.
See [Section 7.1.8, “Server System Variables”](server-system-variables.md "7.1.8 Server System Variables"), for more
information.

MySQL supports a very useful extension that enables the use of
regular [`SELECT`](select.md "15.2.13 SELECT Statement") statements (that is,
without using cursors or local variables) inside a stored
procedure. The result set of such a query is simply sent directly
to the client. Multiple [`SELECT`](select.md "15.2.13 SELECT Statement")
statements generate multiple result sets, so the client must use a
MySQL client library that supports multiple result sets. This
means the client must use a client library from a version of MySQL
at least as recent as 4.1. The client should also specify the
`CLIENT_MULTI_RESULTS` option when it connects.
For C programs, this can be done with the
[`mysql_real_connect()`](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/c-api/8.0/en/mysql-real-connect.html) C API
function. See [mysql\_real\_connect()](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/c-api/8.0/en/mysql-real-connect.html), and
[Multiple Statement Execution Support](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/c-api/8.0/en/c-api-multiple-queries.html).

In MySQL 8.0.22 and later, a user variable referenced by a
statement in a stored procedure has its type determined the first
time the procedure is invoked, and retains this type each time the
procedure is invoked thereafter.
