#### 25.4.3.14 Configuring NDB Cluster Send Buffer Parameters

The `NDB` kernel employs a unified send buffer
whose memory is allocated dynamically from a pool shared by all
transporters. This means that the size of the send buffer can be
adjusted as necessary. Configuration of the unified send buffer
can accomplished by setting the following parameters:

- **TotalSendBufferMemory.**
  This parameter can be set for all types of NDB Cluster
  nodes—that is, it can be set in the
  `[ndbd]`, `[mgm]`, and
  `[api]` (or `[mysql]`)
  sections of the `config.ini` file. It
  represents the total amount of memory (in bytes) to be
  allocated by each node for which it is set for use among
  all configured transporters. If set, its minimum is 256KB;
  the maximum is 4294967039.

  To be backward-compatible with existing configurations, this
  parameter takes as its default value the sum of the maximum
  send buffer sizes of all configured transporters, plus an
  additional 32KB (one page) per transporter. The maximum
  depends on the type of transporter, as shown in the
  following table:

  **Table 25.23 Transporter types with maximum send buffer sizes**

  | Transporter | Maximum Send Buffer Size (bytes) |
  | --- | --- |
  | TCP | [`SendBufferMemory`](mysql-cluster-tcp-definition.md#ndbparam-tcp-sendbuffermemory) (default = 2M) |
  | SHM | 20K |

  This enables existing configurations to function in close to
  the same way as they did with NDB Cluster 6.3 and earlier,
  with the same amount of memory and send buffer space
  available to each transporter. However, memory that is
  unused by one transporter is not available to other
  transporters.
- **OverloadLimit.**
  This parameter is used in the
  `config.ini` file
  `[tcp]` section, and denotes the amount
  of unsent data (in bytes) that must be present in the send
  buffer before the connection is considered overloaded.
  When such an overload condition occurs, transactions that
  affect the overloaded connection fail with NDB API Error
  1218 (Send Buffers overloaded in NDB
  kernel) until the overload status passes. The
  default value is 0, in which case the effective overload
  limit is calculated as `SendBufferMemory *
  0.8` for a given connection. The maximum value
  for this parameter is 4G.
- **SendBufferMemory.**
  This value denotes a hard limit for the amount of memory
  that may be used by a single transporter out of the entire
  pool specified by
  [`TotalSendBufferMemory`](mysql-cluster-ndbd-definition.md#ndbparam-ndbd-totalsendbuffermemory).
  However, the sum of `SendBufferMemory`
  for all configured transporters may be greater than the
  [`TotalSendBufferMemory`](mysql-cluster-ndbd-definition.md#ndbparam-ndbd-totalsendbuffermemory)
  that is set for a given node. This is a way to save memory
  when many nodes are in use, as long as the maximum amount
  of memory is never required by all transporters at the
  same time.

You can use the
[`ndbinfo.transporters`](mysql-cluster-ndbinfo-transporters.md "25.6.16.65 The ndbinfo transporters Table") table to
monitor send buffer memory usage, and to detect slowdown and
overload conditions that can adversely affect performance.
