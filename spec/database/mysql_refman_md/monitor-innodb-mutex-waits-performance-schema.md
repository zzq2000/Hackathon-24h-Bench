### 17.16.2 Monitoring InnoDB Mutex Waits Using Performance Schema

A mutex is a synchronization mechanism used in the code to enforce
that only one thread at a given time can have access to a common
resource. When two or more threads executing in the server need to
access the same resource, the threads compete against each other.
The first thread to obtain a lock on the mutex causes the other
threads to wait until the lock is released.

For `InnoDB` mutexes that are instrumented, mutex
waits can be monitored using
[Performance Schema](performance-schema.md "Chapter 29 MySQL Performance Schema"). Wait
event data collected in Performance Schema tables can help
identify mutexes with the most waits or the greatest total wait
time, for example.

The following example demonstrates how to enable
`InnoDB` mutex wait instruments, how to enable
associated consumers, and how to query wait event data.

1. To view available `InnoDB` mutex wait
   instruments, query the Performance Schema
   [`setup_instruments`](performance-schema-setup-instruments-table.md "29.12.2.3 The setup_instruments Table") table. All
   `InnoDB` mutex wait instruments are disabled
   by default.

   ```sql
   mysql> SELECT *
          FROM performance_schema.setup_instruments
          WHERE NAME LIKE '%wait/synch/mutex/innodb%';
   +---------------------------------------------------------+---------+-------+

   +---------------------------------------------------------+---------+-------+
   ```
2. Some `InnoDB` mutex instances are created at
   server startup and are only instrumented if the associated
   instrument is also enabled at server startup. To ensure that
   all `InnoDB` mutex instances are instrumented
   and enabled, add the following
   `performance-schema-instrument` rule to your
   MySQL configuration file:

   ```ini
   performance-schema-instrument='wait/synch/mutex/innodb/%=ON'
   ```

   If you do not require wait event data for all
   `InnoDB` mutexes, you can disable specific
   instruments by adding additional
   `performance-schema-instrument` rules to your
   MySQL configuration file. For example, to disable
   `InnoDB` mutex wait event instruments related
   to full-text search, add the following rule:

   ```ini
   performance-schema-instrument='wait/synch/mutex/innodb/fts%=OFF'
   ```

   Note

   Rules with a longer prefix such as
   `wait/synch/mutex/innodb/fts%` take
   precedence over rules with shorter prefixes such as
   `wait/synch/mutex/innodb/%`.

   After adding the
   `performance-schema-instrument` rules to your
   configuration file, restart the server. All the
   `InnoDB` mutexes except for those related to
   full text search are enabled. To verify, query the
   [`setup_instruments`](performance-schema-setup-instruments-table.md "29.12.2.3 The setup_instruments Table") table. The
   `ENABLED` and `TIMED`
   columns should be set to `YES` for the
   instruments that you enabled.

   ```sql
   mysql> SELECT *
          FROM performance_schema.setup_instruments
          WHERE NAME LIKE '%wait/synch/mutex/innodb%';
   +-------------------------------------------------------+---------+-------+
   | NAME                                                  | ENABLED | TIMED |
   +-------------------------------------------------------+---------+-------+
   | wait/synch/mutex/innodb/commit_cond_mutex             | YES     | YES   |
   | wait/synch/mutex/innodb/innobase_share_mutex          | YES     | YES   |
   | wait/synch/mutex/innodb/autoinc_mutex                 | YES     | YES   |
   ...
   | wait/synch/mutex/innodb/master_key_id_mutex           | YES     | YES   |
   +-------------------------------------------------------+---------+-------+
   49 rows in set (0.00 sec)
   ```
3. Enable wait event consumers by updating the
   [`setup_consumers`](performance-schema-setup-consumers-table.md "29.12.2.2 The setup_consumers Table") table. Wait event
   consumers are disabled by default.

   ```sql
   mysql> UPDATE performance_schema.setup_consumers
          SET enabled = 'YES'
          WHERE name like 'events_waits%';
   Query OK, 3 rows affected (0.00 sec)
   Rows matched: 3  Changed: 3  Warnings: 0
   ```

   You can verify that wait event consumers are enabled by
   querying the [`setup_consumers`](performance-schema-setup-consumers-table.md "29.12.2.2 The setup_consumers Table")
   table. The [`events_waits_current`](performance-schema-events-waits-current-table.md "29.12.4.1 The events_waits_current Table"),
   [`events_waits_history`](performance-schema-events-waits-history-table.md "29.12.4.2 The events_waits_history Table"), and
   [`events_waits_history_long`](performance-schema-events-waits-history-long-table.md "29.12.4.3 The events_waits_history_long Table")
   consumers should be enabled.

   ```sql
   mysql> SELECT * FROM performance_schema.setup_consumers;
   +----------------------------------+---------+
   | NAME                             | ENABLED |
   +----------------------------------+---------+
   | events_stages_current            | NO      |
   | events_stages_history            | NO      |
   | events_stages_history_long       | NO      |
   | events_statements_current        | YES     |
   | events_statements_history        | YES     |
   | events_statements_history_long   | NO      |
   | events_transactions_current      | YES     |
   | events_transactions_history      | YES     |
   | events_transactions_history_long | NO      |
   | events_waits_current             | YES     |
   | events_waits_history             | YES     |
   | events_waits_history_long        | YES     |
   | global_instrumentation           | YES     |
   | thread_instrumentation           | YES     |
   | statements_digest                | YES     |
   +----------------------------------+---------+
   15 rows in set (0.00 sec)
   ```
4. Once instruments and consumers are enabled, run the workload
   that you want to monitor. In this example, the
   [**mysqlslap**](mysqlslap.md "6.5.8 mysqlslap — A Load Emulation Client") load emulation client is used to
   simulate a workload.

   ```terminal
   $> ./mysqlslap --auto-generate-sql --concurrency=100 --iterations=10
          --number-of-queries=1000 --number-char-cols=6 --number-int-cols=6;
   ```
5. Query the wait event data. In this example, wait event data is
   queried from the
   [`events_waits_summary_global_by_event_name`](performance-schema-wait-summary-tables.md "29.12.20.1 Wait Event Summary Tables")
   table which aggregates data found in the
   [`events_waits_current`](performance-schema-events-waits-current-table.md "29.12.4.1 The events_waits_current Table"),
   [`events_waits_history`](performance-schema-events-waits-history-table.md "29.12.4.2 The events_waits_history Table"), and
   [`events_waits_history_long`](performance-schema-events-waits-history-long-table.md "29.12.4.3 The events_waits_history_long Table") tables.
   Data is summarized by event name
   (`EVENT_NAME`), which is the name of the
   instrument that produced the event. Summarized data includes:

   - `COUNT_STAR`

     The number of summarized wait events.
   - `SUM_TIMER_WAIT`

     The total wait time of the summarized timed wait events.
   - `MIN_TIMER_WAIT`

     The minimum wait time of the summarized timed wait events.
   - `AVG_TIMER_WAIT`

     The average wait time of the summarized timed wait events.
   - `MAX_TIMER_WAIT`

     The maximum wait time of the summarized timed wait events.

   The following query returns the instrument name
   (`EVENT_NAME`), the number of wait events
   (`COUNT_STAR`), and the total wait time for
   the events for that instrument
   (`SUM_TIMER_WAIT`). Because waits are timed
   in picoseconds (trillionths of a second) by default, wait
   times are divided by 1000000000 to show wait times in
   milliseconds. Data is presented in descending order, by the
   number of summarized wait events
   (`COUNT_STAR`). You can adjust the
   `ORDER BY` clause to order the data by total
   wait time.

   ```sql
   mysql> SELECT EVENT_NAME, COUNT_STAR, SUM_TIMER_WAIT/1000000000 SUM_TIMER_WAIT_MS
          FROM performance_schema.events_waits_summary_global_by_event_name
          WHERE SUM_TIMER_WAIT > 0 AND EVENT_NAME LIKE 'wait/synch/mutex/innodb/%'
          ORDER BY COUNT_STAR DESC;
   +---------------------------------------------------------+------------+-------------------+
   | EVENT_NAME                                              | COUNT_STAR | SUM_TIMER_WAIT_MS |

   ```

   Note

   The preceding result set includes wait event data produced
   during the startup process. To exclude this data, you can
   truncate the
   [`events_waits_summary_global_by_event_name`](performance-schema-wait-summary-tables.md "29.12.20.1 Wait Event Summary Tables")
   table immediately after startup and before running your
   workload. However, the truncate operation itself may produce
   a negligible amount wait event data.

   ```sql
   mysql> TRUNCATE performance_schema.events_waits_summary_global_by_event_name;
   ```
