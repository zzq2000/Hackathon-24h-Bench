#### 8.4.4.6 Using the keyring\_file File-Based Keyring Plugin

The `keyring_file` keyring plugin stores
keyring data in a file local to the server host.

As of MySQL 8.0.34, this plugin is deprecated and subject to
removal in a future release of MySQL. Instead, consider using
the `component_keyring_file` component for
storing keyring data (see
[Section 8.4.4.4, “Using the component\_keyring\_file File-Based Keyring Component”](keyring-file-component.md "8.4.4.4 Using the component_keyring_file File-Based Keyring Component")).

Warning

For encryption key management, the
`keyring_file` plugin is not intended as a
regulatory compliance solution. Security standards such as
PCI, FIPS, and others require use of key management systems to
secure, manage, and protect encryption keys in key vaults or
hardware security modules (HSMs).

To install `keyring_file`, use the general
instructions found in
[Section 8.4.4.3, “Keyring Plugin Installation”](keyring-plugin-installation.md "8.4.4.3 Keyring Plugin Installation"), together with the
configuration information specific to
`keyring_file` found here.

To be usable during the server startup process,
`keyring_file` must be loaded using the
[`--early-plugin-load`](server-options.md#option_mysqld_early-plugin-load) option. The
[`keyring_file_data`](keyring-system-variables.md#sysvar_keyring_file_data) system
variable optionally configures the location of the file used by
the `keyring_file` plugin for data storage. The
default value is platform specific. To configure the file
location explicitly, set the variable value at startup. For
example, use these lines in the server
`my.cnf` file, adjusting the
`.so` suffix and file location for your
platform as necessary:

```ini
[mysqld]
early-plugin-load=keyring_file.so
keyring_file_data=/usr/local/mysql/mysql-keyring/keyring
```

If [`keyring_file_data`](keyring-system-variables.md#sysvar_keyring_file_data) is set to
a new location, the keyring plugin creates a new, empty file
containing no keys; this means that any existing encrypted
tables can no longer be accessed.

Keyring operations are transactional: The
`keyring_file` plugin uses a backup file during
write operations to ensure that it can roll back to the original
file if an operation fails. The backup file has the same name as
the value of the
[`keyring_file_data`](keyring-system-variables.md#sysvar_keyring_file_data) system
variable with a suffix of `.backup`.

For additional information about
[`keyring_file_data`](keyring-system-variables.md#sysvar_keyring_file_data), see
[Section 8.4.4.19, “Keyring System Variables”](keyring-system-variables.md "8.4.4.19 Keyring System Variables").

To ensure that keys are flushed only when the correct keyring
storage file exists, `keyring_file` stores a
SHA-256 checksum of the keyring in the file. Before updating the
file, the plugin verifies that it contains the expected
checksum.

The `keyring_file` plugin supports the
functions that comprise the standard MySQL Keyring service
interface. Keyring operations performed by those functions are
accessible at two levels:

- SQL interface: In SQL statements, call the functions
  described in
  [Section 8.4.4.15, “General-Purpose Keyring Key-Management Functions”](keyring-functions-general-purpose.md "8.4.4.15 General-Purpose Keyring Key-Management Functions").
- C interface: In C-language code, call the keyring service
  functions described in [Section 7.6.9.2, “The Keyring Service”](keyring-service.md "7.6.9.2 The Keyring Service").

Example (using the SQL interface):

```sql
SELECT keyring_key_generate('MyKey', 'AES', 32);
SELECT keyring_key_remove('MyKey');
```

For information about the characteristics of key values
permitted by `keyring_file`, see
[Section 8.4.4.13, “Supported Keyring Key Types and Lengths”](keyring-key-types.md "8.4.4.13 Supported Keyring Key Types and Lengths").
