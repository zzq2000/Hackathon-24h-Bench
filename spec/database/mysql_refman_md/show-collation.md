#### 15.7.7.4 SHOW COLLATION Statement

```sql
SHOW COLLATION
    [LIKE 'pattern' | WHERE expr]
```

This statement lists collations supported by the server. By
default, the output from [`SHOW
COLLATION`](show-collation.md "15.7.7.4 SHOW COLLATION Statement") includes all available collations. The
[`LIKE`](string-comparison-functions.md#operator_like) clause, if present, indicates
which collation names to match. The `WHERE`
clause can be given to select rows using more general
conditions, as discussed in [Section 28.8, “Extensions to SHOW Statements”](extended-show.md "28.8 Extensions to SHOW Statements"). For
example:

```sql
mysql> SHOW COLLATION WHERE Charset = 'latin1';
+-------------------+---------+----+---------+----------+---------+
| Collation         | Charset | Id | Default | Compiled | Sortlen |
+-------------------+---------+----+---------+----------+---------+
| latin1_german1_ci | latin1  |  5 |         | Yes      |       1 |
| latin1_swedish_ci | latin1  |  8 | Yes     | Yes      |       1 |
| latin1_danish_ci  | latin1  | 15 |         | Yes      |       1 |
| latin1_german2_ci | latin1  | 31 |         | Yes      |       2 |
| latin1_bin        | latin1  | 47 |         | Yes      |       1 |
| latin1_general_ci | latin1  | 48 |         | Yes      |       1 |
| latin1_general_cs | latin1  | 49 |         | Yes      |       1 |
| latin1_spanish_ci | latin1  | 94 |         | Yes      |       1 |
+-------------------+---------+----+---------+----------+---------+
```

[`SHOW COLLATION`](show-collation.md "15.7.7.4 SHOW COLLATION Statement") output has these
columns:

- `Collation`

  The collation name.
- `Charset`

  The name of the character set with which the collation is
  associated.
- `Id`

  The collation ID.
- `Default`

  Whether the collation is the default for its character set.
- `Compiled`

  Whether the character set is compiled into the server.
- `Sortlen`

  This is related to the amount of memory required to sort
  strings expressed in the character set.
- `Pad_attribute`

  The collation pad attribute, one of `NO
  PAD` or `PAD SPACE`. This
  attribute affects whether trailing spaces are significant in
  string comparisons; for more information, see
  [Trailing Space Handling in Comparisons](charset-binary-collations.md#charset-binary-collations-trailing-space-comparisons "Trailing Space Handling in Comparisons").

To see the default collation for each character set, use the
following statement. `Default` is a reserved
word, so to use it as an identifier, it must be quoted as such:

```sql
mysql> SHOW COLLATION WHERE `Default` = 'Yes';
+---------------------+----------+----+---------+----------+---------+
| Collation           | Charset  | Id | Default | Compiled | Sortlen |
+---------------------+----------+----+---------+----------+---------+
| big5_chinese_ci     | big5     |  1 | Yes     | Yes      |       1 |
| dec8_swedish_ci     | dec8     |  3 | Yes     | Yes      |       1 |
| cp850_general_ci    | cp850    |  4 | Yes     | Yes      |       1 |
| hp8_english_ci      | hp8      |  6 | Yes     | Yes      |       1 |
| koi8r_general_ci    | koi8r    |  7 | Yes     | Yes      |       1 |
| latin1_swedish_ci   | latin1   |  8 | Yes     | Yes      |       1 |
...
```

Collation information is also available from the
`INFORMATION_SCHEMA`
[`COLLATIONS`](information-schema-collations-table.md "28.3.6 The INFORMATION_SCHEMA COLLATIONS Table") table. See
[Section 28.3.6, “The INFORMATION\_SCHEMA COLLATIONS Table”](information-schema-collations-table.md "28.3.6 The INFORMATION_SCHEMA COLLATIONS Table").
