#### 10.4.2.3 Optimizing for BLOB Types

- When storing a large blob containing textual data,
  consider compressing it first. Do not use this technique
  when the entire table is compressed by
  `InnoDB` or `MyISAM`.
- For a table with several columns, to reduce memory
  requirements for queries that do not use the BLOB column,
  consider splitting the BLOB column into a separate table
  and referencing it with a join query when needed.
- Since the performance requirements to retrieve and display
  a BLOB value might be very different from other data
  types, you could put the BLOB-specific table on a
  different storage device or even a separate database
  instance. For example, to retrieve a BLOB might require a
  large sequential disk read that is better suited to a
  traditional hard drive than to an
  [SSD device](glossary.md#glos_ssd "SSD").
- See [Section 10.4.2.2, “Optimizing for Character and String Types”](optimize-character.md "10.4.2.2 Optimizing for Character and String Types") for reasons why a
  binary `VARCHAR` column is sometimes
  preferable to an equivalent BLOB column.
- Rather than testing for equality against a very long text
  string, you can store a hash of the column value in a
  separate column, index that column, and test the hashed
  value in queries. (Use the `MD5()` or
  `CRC32()` function to produce the hash
  value.) Since hash functions can produce duplicate results
  for different inputs, you still include a clause
  `AND blob_column =
  long_string_value` in
  the query to guard against false matches; the performance
  benefit comes from the smaller, easily scanned index for
  the hashed values.
