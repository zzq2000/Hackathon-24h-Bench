### 11.1.1 String Literals

A string is a sequence of bytes or characters, enclosed within
either single quote (`'`) or double quote
(`"`) characters. Examples:

```sql
'a string'
"another string"
```

Quoted strings placed next to each other are concatenated to a
single string. The following lines are equivalent:

```sql
'a string'
'a' ' ' 'string'
```

If the [`ANSI_QUOTES`](sql-mode.md#sqlmode_ansi_quotes) SQL mode is
enabled, string literals can be quoted only within single
quotation marks because a string quoted within double quotation
marks is interpreted as an identifier.

A binary string is a
string of bytes. Every binary string has a character set and
collation named `binary`. A
nonbinary string is a
string of characters. It has a character set other than
`binary` and a collation that is compatible
with the character set.

For both types of strings, comparisons are based on the numeric
values of the string unit. For binary strings, the unit is the
byte; comparisons use numeric byte values. For nonbinary
strings, the unit is the character and some character sets
support multibyte characters; comparisons use numeric character
code values. Character code ordering is a function of the string
collation. (For more information, see
[Section 12.8.5, “The binary Collation Compared to \_bin Collations”](charset-binary-collations.md "12.8.5 The binary Collation Compared to _bin Collations").)

Note

Within the [**mysql**](mysql.md "6.5.1 mysql — The MySQL Command-Line Client") client, binary strings
display using hexadecimal notation, depending on the value of
the [`--binary-as-hex`](mysql-command-options.md#option_mysql_binary-as-hex). For more
information about that option, see [Section 6.5.1, “mysql — The MySQL Command-Line Client”](mysql.md "6.5.1 mysql — The MySQL Command-Line Client").

A character string literal may have an optional character set
introducer and `COLLATE` clause, to designate
it as a string that uses a particular character set and
collation:

```sql
[_charset_name]'string' [COLLATE collation_name]
```

Examples:

```sql
SELECT _latin1'string';
SELECT _binary'string';
SELECT _utf8mb4'string' COLLATE utf8mb4_danish_ci;
```

You can use
`N'literal'` (or
`n'literal'`) to
create a string in the national character set. These statements
are equivalent:

```sql
SELECT N'some text';
SELECT n'some text';
SELECT _utf8'some text';
```

For information about these forms of string syntax, see
[Section 12.3.7, “The National Character Set”](charset-national.md "12.3.7 The National Character Set"), and
[Section 12.3.8, “Character Set Introducers”](charset-introducer.md "12.3.8 Character Set Introducers").

Within a string, certain sequences have special meaning unless
the [`NO_BACKSLASH_ESCAPES`](sql-mode.md#sqlmode_no_backslash_escapes) SQL
mode is enabled. Each of these sequences begins with a backslash
(`\`), known as the *escape
character*. MySQL recognizes the escape sequences
shown in [Table 11.1, “Special Character Escape Sequences”](string-literals.md#character-escape-sequences "Table 11.1 Special Character Escape Sequences"). For all
other escape sequences, backslash is ignored. That is, the
escaped character is interpreted as if it was not escaped. For
example, `\x` is just `x`.
These sequences are case-sensitive. For example,
`\b` is interpreted as a backspace, but
`\B` is interpreted as `B`.
Escape processing is done according to the character set
indicated by the
[`character_set_connection`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_character_set_connection) system
variable. This is true even for strings that are preceded by an
introducer that indicates a different character set, as
discussed in [Section 12.3.6, “Character String Literal Character Set and Collation”](charset-literal.md "12.3.6 Character String Literal Character Set and Collation").

**Table 11.1 Special Character Escape Sequences**

| Escape Sequence | Character Represented by Sequence |
| --- | --- |
| `\0` | An ASCII NUL (`X'00'`) character |
| `\'` | A single quote (`'`) character |
| `\"` | A double quote (`"`) character |
| `\b` | A backspace character |
| `\n` | A newline (linefeed) character |
| `\r` | A carriage return character |
| `\t` | A tab character |
| `\Z` | ASCII 26 (Control+Z); see note following the table |
| `\\` | A backslash (`\`) character |
| `\%` | A `%` character; see note following the table |
| `\_` | A `_` character; see note following the table |

The ASCII 26 character can be encoded as `\Z`
to enable you to work around the problem that ASCII 26 stands
for END-OF-FILE on Windows. ASCII 26 within a file causes
problems if you try to use `mysql
db_name <
file_name`.

The `\%` and `\_` sequences
are used to search for literal instances of `%`
and `_` in pattern-matching contexts where they
would otherwise be interpreted as wildcard characters. See the
description of the [`LIKE`](string-comparison-functions.md#operator_like) operator in
[Section 14.8.1, “String Comparison Functions and Operators”](string-comparison-functions.md "14.8.1 String Comparison Functions and Operators"). If you use
`\%` or `\_` outside of
pattern-matching contexts, they evaluate to the strings
`\%` and `\_`, not to
`%` and `_`.

There are several ways to include quote characters within a
string:

- A `'` inside a string quoted with
  `'` may be written as
  `''`.
- A `"` inside a string quoted with
  `"` may be written as
  `""`.
- Precede the quote character by an escape character
  (`\`).
- A `'` inside a string quoted with
  `"` needs no special treatment and need not
  be doubled or escaped. In the same way, `"`
  inside a string quoted with `'` needs no
  special treatment.

The following [`SELECT`](select.md "15.2.13 SELECT Statement") statements
demonstrate how quoting and escaping work:

```sql
mysql> SELECT 'hello', '"hello"', '""hello""', 'hel''lo', '\'hello';
+-------+---------+-----------+--------+--------+
| hello | "hello" | ""hello"" | hel'lo | 'hello |
+-------+---------+-----------+--------+--------+

mysql> SELECT "hello", "'hello'", "''hello''", "hel""lo", "\"hello";
+-------+---------+-----------+--------+--------+
| hello | 'hello' | ''hello'' | hel"lo | "hello |
+-------+---------+-----------+--------+--------+

mysql> SELECT 'This\nIs\nFour\nLines';
+--------------------+
| This
Is
Four
Lines |
+--------------------+

mysql> SELECT 'disappearing\ backslash';
+------------------------+
| disappearing backslash |
+------------------------+
```

To insert binary data into a string column (such as a
[`BLOB`](blob.md "13.3.4 The BLOB and TEXT Types") column), you should
represent certain characters by escape sequences. Backslash
(`\`) and the quote character used to quote the
string must be escaped. In certain client environments, it may
also be necessary to escape `NUL` or Control+Z.
The [**mysql**](mysql.md "6.5.1 mysql — The MySQL Command-Line Client") client truncates quoted strings
containing `NUL` characters if they are not
escaped, and Control+Z may be taken for END-OF-FILE on Windows
if not escaped. For the escape sequences that represent each of
these characters, see
[Table 11.1, “Special Character Escape Sequences”](string-literals.md#character-escape-sequences "Table 11.1 Special Character Escape Sequences").

When writing application programs, any string that might contain
any of these special characters must be properly escaped before
the string is used as a data value in an SQL statement that is
sent to the MySQL server. You can do this in two ways:

- Process the string with a function that escapes the special
  characters. In a C program, you can use the
  [`mysql_real_escape_string_quote()`](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/c-api/8.0/en/mysql-real-escape-string-quote.html)
  C API function to escape characters. See
  [mysql\_real\_escape\_string\_quote()](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/c-api/8.0/en/mysql-real-escape-string-quote.html). Within SQL
  statements that construct other SQL statements, you can use
  the [`QUOTE()`](string-functions.md#function_quote) function. The
  Perl DBI interface provides a `quote`
  method to convert special characters to the proper escape
  sequences. See [Section 31.9, “MySQL Perl API”](apis-perl.md "31.9 MySQL Perl API"). Other language
  interfaces may provide a similar capability.
- As an alternative to explicitly escaping special characters,
  many MySQL APIs provide a placeholder capability that
  enables you to insert special markers into a statement
  string, and then bind data values to them when you issue the
  statement. In this case, the API takes care of escaping
  special characters in the values for you.
