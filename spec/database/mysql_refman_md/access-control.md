MySQL enables the creation of accounts that permit client users to
connect to the server and access data managed by the server. The
primary function of the MySQL privilege system is to authenticate a
user who connects from a given host and to associate that user with
privileges on a database such as
[`SELECT`](select.md "15.2.13 SELECT Statement"),
[`INSERT`](insert.md "15.2.7 INSERT Statement"),
[`UPDATE`](update.md "15.2.17 UPDATE Statement"), and
[`DELETE`](delete.md "15.2.2 DELETE Statement"). Additional functionality
includes the ability to grant privileges for administrative
operations.

To control which users can connect, each account can be assigned
authentication credentials such as a password. The user interface to
MySQL accounts consists of SQL statements such as
[`CREATE USER`](create-user.md "15.7.1.3 CREATE USER Statement"),
[`GRANT`](grant.md "15.7.1.6 GRANT Statement"), and
[`REVOKE`](revoke.md "15.7.1.8 REVOKE Statement"). See
[Section 15.7.1, “Account Management Statements”](account-management-statements.md "15.7.1 Account Management Statements").

The MySQL privilege system ensures that all users may perform only
the operations permitted to them. As a user, when you connect to a
MySQL server, your identity is determined by *the host from
which you connect* and *the user name you
specify*. When you issue requests after connecting, the
system grants privileges according to your identity and
*what you want to do*.

MySQL considers both your host name and user name in identifying you
because there is no reason to assume that a given user name belongs
to the same person on all hosts. For example, the user
`joe` who connects from
`office.example.com` need not be the same person as
the user `joe` who connects from
`home.example.com`. MySQL handles this by enabling
you to distinguish users on different hosts that happen to have the
same name: You can grant one set of privileges for connections by
`joe` from `office.example.com`,
and a different set of privileges for connections by
`joe` from `home.example.com`. To
see what privileges a given account has, use the
[`SHOW GRANTS`](show-grants.md "15.7.7.21 SHOW GRANTS Statement") statement. For example:

```sql
SHOW GRANTS FOR 'joe'@'office.example.com';
SHOW GRANTS FOR 'joe'@'home.example.com';
```

Internally, the server stores privilege information in the grant
tables of the `mysql` system database. The MySQL
server reads the contents of these tables into memory when it starts
and bases access-control decisions on the in-memory copies of the
grant tables.

MySQL access control involves two stages when you run a client
program that connects to the server:

**Stage 1:** The server accepts or
rejects the connection based on your identity and whether you can
verify your identity by supplying the correct password.

**Stage 2:** Assuming that you can
connect, the server checks each statement you issue to determine
whether you have sufficient privileges to perform it. For example,
if you try to select rows from a table in a database or drop a table
from the database, the server verifies that you have the
[`SELECT`](privileges-provided.md#priv_select) privilege for the table or the
[`DROP`](privileges-provided.md#priv_drop) privilege for the database.

For a more detailed description of what happens during each stage,
see [Section 8.2.6, “Access Control, Stage 1: Connection Verification”](connection-access.md "8.2.6 Access Control, Stage 1: Connection Verification"), and
[Section 8.2.7, “Access Control, Stage 2: Request Verification”](request-access.md "8.2.7 Access Control, Stage 2: Request Verification"). For help in diagnosing
privilege-related problems, see
[Section 8.2.22, “Troubleshooting Problems Connecting to MySQL”](problems-connecting.md "8.2.22 Troubleshooting Problems Connecting to MySQL").

If your privileges are changed (either by yourself or someone else)
while you are connected, those changes do not necessarily take
effect immediately for the next statement that you issue. For
details about the conditions under which the server reloads the
grant tables, see [Section 8.2.13, “When Privilege Changes Take Effect”](privilege-changes.md "8.2.13 When Privilege Changes Take Effect").

There are some things that you cannot do with the MySQL privilege
system:

- You cannot explicitly specify that a given user should be denied
  access. That is, you cannot explicitly match a user and then
  refuse the connection.
- You cannot specify that a user has privileges to create or drop
  tables in a database but not to create or drop the database
  itself.
- A password applies globally to an account. You cannot associate
  a password with a specific object such as a database, table, or
  routine.
