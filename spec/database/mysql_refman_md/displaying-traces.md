### 10.15.13 Displaying Traces in Other Applications

Examining a trace in the [**mysql**](mysql.md "6.5.1 mysql — The MySQL Command-Line Client") command-line
client can be made less difficult using the `pager
less` command (or your operating platform's
equivalent). An alternative can be to send the trace to a file,
similarly to what is shown here:

```sql
SELECT TRACE INTO DUMPFILE file
FROM INFORMATION_SCHEMA.OPTIMIZER_TRACE;
```

You can then pass this file to a JSON-aware text editor or other
viewer, such as the [JsonView
add-on for Firefox and Chrome](https://jsonview.com/), which shows objects in
color and allows objects to be expanded or collapsed.

`INTO DUMPFILE` is preferable to `INTO
OUTFILE` for this purpose, since the latter escapes
newlines. As noted previously, you should ensure that
[`end_markers_in_json`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_end_markers_in_json) is
`OFF`when executing the `SELECT
INTO` statement, so that the output is valid JSON.
