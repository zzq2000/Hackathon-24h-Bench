### 8.7.4 SELinux File Context

The MySQL Server reads from and writes to many files. If the
SELinux context is not set correctly for these files, access to
the files could be denied.

The instructions that follow use the `semanage`
binary to manage file context; on RHEL, it's part of the
`policycoreutils-python-utils` package:

```terminal
yum install -y policycoreutils-python-utils
```

After installing the `semanage` binary, you can
list MySQL file contexts using `semanage` with
the `fcontext` option.

```terminal
semanage fcontext -l | grep -i mysql
```

#### Setting the MySQL Data Directory Context

The default data directory location is
`/var/lib/mysql/`; and the SELinux context
used is `mysqld_db_t`.

If you edit the configuration file to use a different location
for the data directory, or for any of the files normally in the
data directory (such as the binary logs), you may need to set
the context for the new location. For example:

```terminal
semanage fcontext -a -t mysqld_db_t "/path/to/my/custom/datadir(/.*)?"
restorecon -Rv /path/to/my/custom/datadir

semanage fcontext -a -t mysqld_db_t "/path/to/my/custom/logdir(/.*)?"
restorecon -Rv /path/to/my/custom/logdir
```

#### Setting the MySQL Error Log File Context

The default location for RedHat RPMs is
`/var/log/mysqld.log`; and the SELinux
context type used is `mysqld_log_t`.

If you edit the configuration file to use a different location,
you may need to set the context for the new location. For
example:

```terminal
semanage fcontext -a -t mysqld_log_t "/path/to/my/custom/error.log"
restorecon -Rv /path/to/my/custom/error.log
```

#### Setting the PID File Context

The default location for the PID file is
`/var/run/mysqld/mysqld.pid`; and the SELinux
context type used is `mysqld_var_run_t`.

If you edit the configuration file to use a different location,
you may need to set the context for the new location. For
example:

```terminal
semanage fcontext -a -t mysqld_var_run_t "/path/to/my/custom/pidfile/directory/.*?"
restorecon -Rv /path/to/my/custom/pidfile/directory
```

#### Setting the Unix Domain Socket Context

The default location for the Unix domain socket is
`/var/lib/mysql/mysql.sock`; and the SELinux
context type used is `mysqld_var_run_t`.

If you edit the configuration file to use a different location,
you may need to set the context for the new location. For
example:

```terminal
semanage fcontext -a -t mysqld_var_run_t "/path/to/my/custom/mysql\.sock"
restorecon -Rv /path/to/my/custom/mysql.sock
```

#### Setting the secure\_file\_priv Directory Context

For MySQL versions since 5.6.34, 5.7.16, and 8.0.11.

Installing the MySQL Server RPM creates a
`/var/lib/mysql-files/` directory but does
not set the SELinux context for it. The
`/var/lib/mysql-files/` directory is intended
to be used for operations such as `SELECT ... INTO
OUTFILE`.

If you enabled the use of this directory by setting
`secure_file_priv`, you may need to set the
context like so:

```terminal
semanage fcontext -a -t mysqld_db_t "/var/lib/mysql-files/(/.*)?"
restorecon -Rv /var/lib/mysql-files
```

Edit this path if you used a different location. For security
purposes, this directory should never be within the data
directory.

For more information about this variable, see the
[`secure_file_priv`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_secure_file_priv) documentation.
