### 12.13.1 Character Definition Arrays

Each simple character set has a configuration file located in
the `sql/share/charsets` directory. For a
character set named *`MYSYS`*, the file
is named
`MYSET.xml`. It
uses `<map>` array elements to list
character set properties. `<map>`
elements appear within these elements:

- `<ctype>` defines attributes for each
  character.
- `<lower>` and
  `<upper>` list the lowercase and
  uppercase characters.
- `<unicode>` maps 8-bit character
  values to Unicode values.
- `<collation>` elements indicate
  character ordering for comparison and sorting, one element
  per collation. Binary collations need no
  `<map>` element because the character
  codes themselves provide the ordering.

For a complex character set as implemented in a
`ctype-MYSET.c`
file in the `strings` directory, there are
corresponding arrays:
`ctype_MYSET[]`,
`to_lower_MYSET[]`,
and so forth. Not every complex character set has all of the
arrays. See also the existing `ctype-*.c`
files for examples. See the
`CHARSET_INFO.txt` file in the
`strings` directory for additional
information.

Most of the arrays are indexed by character value and have 256
elements. The `<ctype>` array is indexed
by character value + 1 and has 257 elements. This is a legacy
convention for handling `EOF`.

`<ctype>` array elements are bit values.
Each element describes the attributes of a single character in
the character set. Each attribute is associated with a bitmask,
as defined in `include/m_ctype.h`:

```c
#define _MY_U   01      /* Upper case */
#define _MY_L   02      /* Lower case */
#define _MY_NMR 04      /* Numeral (digit) */
#define _MY_SPC 010     /* Spacing character */
#define _MY_PNT 020     /* Punctuation */
#define _MY_CTR 040     /* Control character */
#define _MY_B   0100    /* Blank */
#define _MY_X   0200    /* heXadecimal digit */
```

The `<ctype>` value for a given character
should be the union of the applicable bitmask values that
describe the character. For example, `'A'` is
an uppercase character (`_MY_U`) as well as a
hexadecimal digit (`_MY_X`), so its
`ctype` value should be defined like this:

```c
ctype['A'+1] = _MY_U | _MY_X = 01 | 0200 = 0201
```

The bitmask values in `m_ctype.h` are octal
values, but the elements of the `<ctype>`
array in
`MYSET.xml` should
be written as hexadecimal values.

The `<lower>` and
`<upper>` arrays hold the lowercase and
uppercase characters corresponding to each member of the
character set. For example:

```none
lower['A'] should contain 'a'
upper['a'] should contain 'A'
```

Each `<collation>` array indicates how
characters should be ordered for comparison and sorting
purposes. MySQL sorts characters based on the values of this
information. In some cases, this is the same as the
`<upper>` array, which means that sorting
is case-insensitive. For more complicated sorting rules (for
complex character sets), see the discussion of string collating
in [Section 12.13.2, “String Collating Support for Complex Character Sets”](string-collating.md "12.13.2 String Collating Support for Complex Character Sets").
