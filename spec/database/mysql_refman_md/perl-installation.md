### 2.10.1 Installing Perl on Unix

MySQL Perl support requires that you have installed MySQL client
programming support (libraries and header files). Most
installation methods install the necessary files. If you install
MySQL from RPM files on Linux, be sure to install the developer
RPM as well. The client programs are in the client RPM, but client
programming support is in the developer RPM.

The files you need for Perl support can be obtained from the CPAN
(Comprehensive Perl Archive Network) at
<http://search.cpan.org>.

The easiest way to install Perl modules on Unix is to use the
`CPAN` module. For example:

```terminal
$> perl -MCPAN -e shell
cpan> install DBI
cpan> install DBD::mysql
```

The `DBD::mysql` installation runs a number of
tests. These tests attempt to connect to the local MySQL server
using the default user name and password. (The default user name
is your login name on Unix, and `ODBC` on
Windows. The default password is “no password.”) If
you cannot connect to the server with those values (for example,
if your account has a password), the tests fail. You can use
`force install DBD::mysql` to ignore the failed
tests.

`DBI` requires the
`Data::Dumper` module. It may be installed; if
not, you should install it before installing
`DBI`.

It is also possible to download the module distributions in the
form of compressed **tar** archives and build the
modules manually. For example, to unpack and build a DBI
distribution, use a procedure such as this:

1. Unpack the distribution into the current directory:

   ```terminal
   $> gunzip < DBI-VERSION.tar.gz | tar xvf -
   ```

   This command creates a directory named
   `DBI-VERSION`.
2. Change location into the top-level directory of the unpacked
   distribution:

   ```terminal
   $> cd DBI-VERSION
   ```
3. Build the distribution and compile everything:

   ```terminal
   $> perl Makefile.PL
   $> make
   $> make test
   $> make install
   ```

The **make test** command is important because it
verifies that the module is working. Note that when you run that
command during the `DBD::mysql` installation to
exercise the interface code, the MySQL server must be running or
the test fails.

It is a good idea to rebuild and reinstall the
`DBD::mysql` distribution whenever you install a
new release of MySQL. This ensures that the latest versions of the
MySQL client libraries are installed correctly.

If you do not have access rights to install Perl modules in the
system directory or if you want to install local Perl modules, the
