### 12.3.4 Table Character Set and Collation

Every table has a table character set and a table collation. The
[`CREATE TABLE`](create-table.md "15.1.20 CREATE TABLE Statement") and
[`ALTER TABLE`](alter-table.md "15.1.9 ALTER TABLE Statement") statements have
optional clauses for specifying the table character set and
collation:

```sql
CREATE TABLE tbl_name (column_list)
    [[DEFAULT] CHARACTER SET charset_name]
    [COLLATE collation_name]]

ALTER TABLE tbl_name
    [[DEFAULT] CHARACTER SET charset_name]
    [COLLATE collation_name]
```

Example:

```sql
CREATE TABLE t1 ( ... )
CHARACTER SET latin1 COLLATE latin1_danish_ci;
```

MySQL chooses the table character set and collation in the
following manner:

- If both `CHARACTER SET
  charset_name` and
  `COLLATE
  collation_name` are
  specified, character set
  *`charset_name`* and collation
  *`collation_name`* are used.
- If `CHARACTER SET
  charset_name` is
  specified without `COLLATE`, character set
  *`charset_name`* and its default
  collation are used. To see the default collation for each
  character set, use the [`SHOW CHARACTER
  SET`](show-character-set.md "15.7.7.3 SHOW CHARACTER SET Statement") statement or query the
  `INFORMATION_SCHEMA`
  [`CHARACTER_SETS`](information-schema-character-sets-table.md "28.3.4 The INFORMATION_SCHEMA CHARACTER_SETS Table") table.
- If `COLLATE
  collation_name` is
  specified without `CHARACTER SET`, the
  character set associated with
  *`collation_name`* and collation
  *`collation_name`* are used.
- Otherwise (neither `CHARACTER SET` nor
  `COLLATE` is specified), the database
  character set and collation are used.

The table character set and collation are used as default values
for column definitions if the column character set and collation
are not specified in individual column definitions. The table
character set and collation are MySQL extensions; there are no
such things in standard SQL.
