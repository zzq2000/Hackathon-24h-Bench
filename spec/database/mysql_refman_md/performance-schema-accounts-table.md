#### 29.12.8.1 The accounts Table

The [`accounts`](performance-schema-accounts-table.md "29.12.8.1 The accounts Table") table contains a row
for each account that has connected to the MySQL server. For
each account, the table counts the current and total number of
connections. The table size is autosized at server startup. To
set the table size explicitly, set the
[`performance_schema_accounts_size`](performance-schema-system-variables.md#sysvar_performance_schema_accounts_size)
system variable at server startup. To disable account
statistics, set this variable to 0.

The [`accounts`](performance-schema-accounts-table.md "29.12.8.1 The accounts Table") table has the
following columns. For a description of how the Performance
Schema maintains rows in this table, including the effect of
