### 15.1.1 Atomic Data Definition Statement Support

MySQL 8.0 supports atomic Data Definition Language
(DDL) statements. This feature is referred to as *atomic
DDL*. An atomic DDL statement combines the data
dictionary updates, storage engine operations, and binary log
writes associated with a DDL operation into a single, atomic
operation. The operation is either committed, with applicable
changes persisted to the data dictionary, storage engine, and
binary log, or is rolled back, even if the server halts during the
operation.

Note

*Atomic DDL* is not *transactional
DDL*. DDL statements, atomic or otherwise, implicitly
end any transaction that is active in the current session, as if
you had done a [`COMMIT`](commit.md "15.3.1 START TRANSACTION, COMMIT, and ROLLBACK Statements") before
executing the statement. This means that DDL statements cannot
be performed within another transaction, within transaction
control statements such as
[`START TRANSACTION ...
COMMIT`](commit.md "15.3.1 START TRANSACTION, COMMIT, and ROLLBACK Statements"), or combined with other statements within the
same transaction.

Atomic DDL is made possible by the introduction of the MySQL data
dictionary in MySQL 8.0. In earlier MySQL versions,
metadata was stored in metadata files, nontransactional tables,
and storage engine-specific dictionaries, which necessitated
intermediate commits. Centralized, transactional metadata storage
provided by the MySQL data dictionary removed this barrier, making
it possible to restructure DDL statement operations to be atomic.

The atomic DDL feature is described under the following topics in
this section:

- [Supported DDL Statements](atomic-ddl.md#atomic-ddl-supported-statements "Supported DDL Statements")
- [Atomic DDL Characteristics](atomic-ddl.md#atomic-ddl-characteristics "Atomic DDL Characteristics")
- [Changes in DDL Statement Behavior](atomic-ddl.md#atomic-ddl-statement-behavior "Changes in DDL Statement Behavior")
- [Storage Engine Support](atomic-ddl.md#atomic-ddl-storage-engine-support "Storage Engine Support")
- [Viewing DDL Logs](atomic-ddl.md#atomic-ddl-view-logs "Viewing DDL Logs")

#### Supported DDL Statements

The atomic DDL feature supports both table and non-table DDL
statements. Table-related DDL operations require storage engine
support, whereas non-table DDL operations do not. Currently,
only the `InnoDB` storage engine supports
atomic DDL.

- Supported table DDL statements include
  `CREATE`, `ALTER`, and
  `DROP` statements for databases,
  tablespaces, tables, and indexes, and the
  [`TRUNCATE TABLE`](truncate-table.md "15.1.37 TRUNCATE TABLE Statement") statement.
- Supported non-table DDL statements include:

  - `CREATE` and `DROP`
    statements, and, if applicable, `ALTER`
    statements for stored programs, triggers, views, and
    loadable functions.
  - Account management statements:
    `CREATE`, `ALTER`,
    `DROP`, and, if applicable,
    `RENAME` statements for users and
    roles, as well as [`GRANT`](grant.md "15.7.1.6 GRANT Statement")
    and [`REVOKE`](revoke.md "15.7.1.8 REVOKE Statement") statements.

The following statements are not supported by the atomic DDL
feature:

- Table-related DDL statements that involve a storage engine
  other than `InnoDB`.
- [`INSTALL PLUGIN`](install-plugin.md "15.7.4.4 INSTALL PLUGIN Statement") and
  [`UNINSTALL PLUGIN`](uninstall-plugin.md "15.7.4.6 UNINSTALL PLUGIN Statement")
  statements.
- [`INSTALL COMPONENT`](install-component.md "15.7.4.3 INSTALL COMPONENT Statement") and
  [`UNINSTALL COMPONENT`](uninstall-component.md "15.7.4.5 UNINSTALL COMPONENT Statement")
  statements.
- [`CREATE SERVER`](create-server.md "15.1.18 CREATE SERVER Statement"),
  [`ALTER SERVER`](alter-server.md "15.1.8 ALTER SERVER Statement"), and
  [`DROP SERVER`](drop-server.md "15.1.30 DROP SERVER Statement") statements.

#### Atomic DDL Characteristics

The characteristics of atomic DDL statements include the
following:

- Metadata updates, binary log writes, and storage engine
  operations, where applicable, are combined into a single
  atomic operation.
- There are no intermediate commits at the SQL layer during
  the DDL operation.
- Where applicable:

  - The state of data dictionary, routine, event, and
    loadable function caches is consistent with the status
    of the DDL operation, meaning that caches are updated to
    reflect whether or not the DDL operation was completed
    successfully or rolled back.
  - The storage engine methods involved in a DDL operation
    do not perform intermediate commits, and the storage
    engine registers itself as part of the DDL operation.
  - The storage engine supports redo and rollback of DDL
    operations, which is performed in the
    *Post-DDL* phase of the DDL
    operation.
- The visible behaviour of DDL operations is atomic, which
  changes the behavior of some DDL statements. See
  [Changes in DDL Statement Behavior](atomic-ddl.md#atomic-ddl-statement-behavior "Changes in DDL Statement Behavior").

#### Changes in DDL Statement Behavior

This section describes changes in DDL statement behavior due to
the introduction of atomic DDL support.

- [`DROP TABLE`](drop-table.md "15.1.32 DROP TABLE Statement") operations are
  fully atomic if all named tables use a storage engine which
  supports atomic DDL. The statement either drops all tables
  successfully or is rolled back.

  [`DROP TABLE`](drop-table.md "15.1.32 DROP TABLE Statement") fails with an
  error if a named table does not exist, and no changes are
  made, regardless of the storage engine. This change in
  behavior is demonstrated in the following example, where the
  [`DROP TABLE`](drop-table.md "15.1.32 DROP TABLE Statement") statement fails
  because a named table does not exist:

  ```sql
  mysql> CREATE TABLE t1 (c1 INT);
  mysql> DROP TABLE t1, t2;
  ERROR 1051 (42S02): Unknown table 'test.t2'
  mysql> SHOW TABLES;
  +----------------+
  | Tables_in_test |
  +----------------+
  | t1             |
  +----------------+
  ```

  Prior to the introduction of atomic DDL,
  [`DROP TABLE`](drop-table.md "15.1.32 DROP TABLE Statement") reports an error
  for the named table that does not exist but succeeds for the
  named table that does exist:

  ```sql
  mysql> CREATE TABLE t1 (c1 INT);
  mysql> DROP TABLE t1, t2;
  ERROR 1051 (42S02): Unknown table 'test.t2'
  mysql> SHOW TABLES;
  Empty set (0.00 sec)
  ```

  Note

  Due to this change in behavior, a partially completed
  [`DROP TABLE`](drop-table.md "15.1.32 DROP TABLE Statement") statement on a
  MySQL 5.7 replication source server fails when replicated
  on a MySQL 8.0 replica. To avoid this failure scenario,
  use `IF EXISTS` syntax in
  [`DROP TABLE`](drop-table.md "15.1.32 DROP TABLE Statement") statements to
  prevent errors from occurring for tables that do not
  exist.
- [`DROP DATABASE`](drop-database.md "15.1.24 DROP DATABASE Statement") is atomic if
  all tables use a storage engine which supports atomic DDL.
  The statement either drops all objects successfully or is
  rolled back. However, removal of the database directory from
  the file system occurs last and is not part of the atomic
  operation. If removal of the database directory fails due to
  a file system error or server halt, the
  [`DROP DATABASE`](drop-database.md "15.1.24 DROP DATABASE Statement") transaction is
  not rolled back.
- For tables that do not use a storage engine which supports
  atomic DDL, table deletion occurs outside of the atomic
  [`DROP TABLE`](drop-table.md "15.1.32 DROP TABLE Statement") or
  [`DROP DATABASE`](drop-database.md "15.1.24 DROP DATABASE Statement") transaction.
  Such table deletions are written to the binary log
  individually, which limits the discrepancy between the
  storage engine, data dictionary, and binary log to one table
  at most in the case of an interrupted
  [`DROP TABLE`](drop-table.md "15.1.32 DROP TABLE Statement") or
  [`DROP DATABASE`](drop-database.md "15.1.24 DROP DATABASE Statement") operation. For
  operations that drop multiple tables, the tables that do not
  use a storage engine which supports atomic DDL are dropped
  before tables that do.
- [`CREATE TABLE`](create-table.md "15.1.20 CREATE TABLE Statement"),
  [`ALTER TABLE`](alter-table.md "15.1.9 ALTER TABLE Statement"),
  [`RENAME TABLE`](rename-table.md "15.1.36 RENAME TABLE Statement"),
  [`TRUNCATE TABLE`](truncate-table.md "15.1.37 TRUNCATE TABLE Statement"),
  [`CREATE TABLESPACE`](create-tablespace.md "15.1.21 CREATE TABLESPACE Statement"), and
  [`DROP TABLESPACE`](drop-tablespace.md "15.1.33 DROP TABLESPACE Statement") operations
  for tables that use a storage engine which supports atomic
  DDL are either fully committed or rolled back if the server
  halts during their operation. In earlier MySQL releases,
  interruption of these operations could cause discrepancies
  between the storage engine, data dictionary, and binary log,
  or leave behind orphan files. [`RENAME
  TABLE`](rename-table.md "15.1.36 RENAME TABLE Statement") operations are only atomic if all named
  tables use a storage engine which supports atomic DDL.
- As of MySQL 8.0.21, on storage engines that support atomic
  DDL, the
  [`CREATE
  TABLE ... SELECT`](create-table-select.md "15.1.20.4 CREATE TABLE ... SELECT Statement") statement is logged as one
  transaction in the binary log when row-based replication is
  in use. Previously, it was logged as two transactions, one
  to create the table, and the other to insert data. A server
  failure between the two transactions or while inserting data
  could result in replication of an empty table. With the
  introduction of atomic DDL support,
  [`CREATE
  TABLE ... SELECT`](create-table-select.md "15.1.20.4 CREATE TABLE ... SELECT Statement") statements are now safe for
  row-based replication and permitted for use with GTID-based
  replication.

  On storage engines that support both atomic DDL and foreign
  key constraints, creation of foreign keys is not permitted
  in
  [`CREATE
  TABLE ... SELECT`](create-table-select.md "15.1.20.4 CREATE TABLE ... SELECT Statement") statements when row-based
  replication is in use. Foreign key constraints can be added
  later using [`ALTER TABLE`](alter-table.md "15.1.9 ALTER TABLE Statement").

  When
  [`CREATE
  TABLE ... SELECT`](create-table-select.md "15.1.20.4 CREATE TABLE ... SELECT Statement") is applied as an atomic
  operation, a metadata lock is held on the table while data
  is inserted, which prevents concurrent access to the table
  for the duration of the operation.
- [`DROP VIEW`](drop-view.md "15.1.35 DROP VIEW Statement") fails if a named
  view does not exist, and no changes are made. The change in
  behavior is demonstrated in this example, where the
  [`DROP VIEW`](drop-view.md "15.1.35 DROP VIEW Statement") statement fails
  because a named view does not exist:

  ```sql
  mysql> CREATE VIEW test.viewA AS SELECT * FROM t;
  mysql> DROP VIEW test.viewA, test.viewB;
  ERROR 1051 (42S02): Unknown table 'test.viewB'
  mysql> SHOW FULL TABLES IN test WHERE TABLE_TYPE LIKE 'VIEW';
  +----------------+------------+
  | Tables_in_test | Table_type |
  +----------------+------------+
  | viewA          | VIEW       |
  +----------------+------------+
  ```

  Prior to the introduction of atomic DDL,
  [`DROP VIEW`](drop-view.md "15.1.35 DROP VIEW Statement") returns an error
  for the named view that does not exist but succeeds for the
  named view that does exist:

  ```sql
  mysql> CREATE VIEW test.viewA AS SELECT * FROM t;
  mysql> DROP VIEW test.viewA, test.viewB;
  ERROR 1051 (42S02): Unknown table 'test.viewB'
  mysql> SHOW FULL TABLES IN test WHERE TABLE_TYPE LIKE 'VIEW';
  Empty set (0.00 sec)
  ```

  Note

  Due to this change in behavior, a partially completed
  [`DROP VIEW`](drop-view.md "15.1.35 DROP VIEW Statement") operation on a
  MySQL 5.7 replication source server fails when replicated
  on a MySQL 8.0 replica. To avoid this failure scenario,
  use `IF EXISTS` syntax in
  [`DROP VIEW`](drop-view.md "15.1.35 DROP VIEW Statement") statements to
  prevent an error from occurring for views that do not
  exist.
- Partial execution of account management statements is no
  longer permitted. Account management statements either
  succeed for all named users or roll back and have no effect
  if an error occurs. In earlier MySQL versions, account
  management statements that name multiple users could succeed
  for some users and fail for others.

  The change in behavior is demonstrated in this example,
  where the second [`CREATE USER`](create-user.md "15.7.1.3 CREATE USER Statement")
  statement returns an error but fails because it cannot
  succeed for all named users.

  ```sql
  mysql> CREATE USER userA;
  mysql> CREATE USER userA, userB;
  ERROR 1396 (HY000): Operation CREATE USER failed for 'userA'@'%'
  mysql> SELECT User FROM mysql.user WHERE User LIKE 'user%';
  +-------+
  | User  |
  +-------+
  | userA |
  +-------+
  ```

  Prior to the introduction of atomic DDL, the second
  `CREATE USER` statement returns an error
  for the named user that does not exist but succeeds for the
  named user that does exist:

  ```sql
  mysql> CREATE USER userA;
  mysql> CREATE USER userA, userB;
  ERROR 1396 (HY000): Operation CREATE USER failed for 'userA'@'%'
  mysql> SELECT User FROM mysql.user WHERE User LIKE 'user%';
  +-------+
  | User  |
  +-------+
  | userA |
  | userB |
  +-------+
  ```

  Note

  Due to this change in behavior, partially completed
  account management statements on a MySQL 5.7 replication
  source server fail when replicated on a MySQL 8.0 replica.
  To avoid this failure scenario, use `IF
  EXISTS` or `IF NOT EXISTS`
  syntax, as appropriate, in account management statements
  to prevent errors related to named users.

#### Storage Engine Support

Currently, only the `InnoDB` storage engine
supports atomic DDL. Storage engines that do not support atomic
DDL are exempted from DDL atomicity. DDL operations involving
exempted storage engines remain capable of introducing
inconsistencies that can occur when operations are interrupted
or only partially completed.

To support redo and rollback of DDL operations,
`InnoDB` writes DDL logs to the
`mysql.innodb_ddl_log` table, which is a hidden
data dictionary table that resides in the
`mysql.ibd` data dictionary tablespace.

To view DDL logs that are written to the
`mysql.innodb_ddl_log` table during a DDL
operation, enable the
[`innodb_print_ddl_logs`](innodb-parameters.md#sysvar_innodb_print_ddl_logs)
configuration option. For more information, see
[Viewing DDL Logs](atomic-ddl.md#atomic-ddl-view-logs "Viewing DDL Logs").

Note

The redo logs for changes to the
`mysql.innodb_ddl_log` table are flushed to
disk immediately regardless of the
[`innodb_flush_log_at_trx_commit`](innodb-parameters.md#sysvar_innodb_flush_log_at_trx_commit)
setting. Flushing the redo logs immediately avoids situations
where data files are modified by DDL operations but the redo
logs for changes to the
`mysql.innodb_ddl_log` table resulting from
those operations are not persisted to disk. Such a situation
could cause errors during rollback or recovery.

The `InnoDB` storage engine executes DDL
operations in phases. DDL operations such as
[`ALTER TABLE`](alter-table.md "15.1.9 ALTER TABLE Statement") may perform the
*Prepare* and *Perform*
phases multiple times prior to the *Commit*
phase.

1. *Prepare*: Create the required objects
   and write the DDL logs to the
   `mysql.innodb_ddl_log` table. The DDL logs
   define how to roll forward and roll back the DDL operation.
2. *Perform*: Perform the DDL operation. For
   example, perform a create routine for a `CREATE
   TABLE` operation.
3. *Commit*: Update the data dictionary and
   commit the data dictionary transaction.
4. *Post-DDL*: Replay and remove DDL logs
   from the `mysql.innodb_ddl_log` table. To
   ensure that rollback can be performed safely without
   introducing inconsistencies, file operations such as
   renaming or removing data files are performed in this final
   phase. This phase also removes dynamic metadata from the
   `mysql.innodb_dynamic_metadata` data
   dictionary table for [`DROP
   TABLE`](drop-table.md "15.1.32 DROP TABLE Statement"), [`TRUNCATE
   TABLE`](truncate-table.md "15.1.37 TRUNCATE TABLE Statement"), and other DDL operations that rebuild the
   table.

DDL logs are replayed and removed from the
`mysql.innodb_ddl_log` table during the
*Post-DDL* phase, regardless of whether the
DDL operation is committed or rolled back. DDL logs should only
remain in the `mysql.innodb_ddl_log` table if
the server is halted during a DDL operation. In this case, the
DDL logs are replayed and removed after recovery.

In a recovery situation, a DDL operation may be committed or
rolled back when the server is restarted. If the data dictionary
transaction that was performed during the
*Commit* phase of a DDL operation is present
in the redo log and binary log, the operation is considered
successful and is rolled forward. Otherwise, the incomplete data
dictionary transaction is rolled back when
`InnoDB` replays data dictionary redo logs, and
the DDL operation is rolled back.

#### Viewing DDL Logs

To view DDL logs that are written to the
`mysql.innodb_ddl_log` data dictionary table
during atomic DDL operations that involve the
`InnoDB` storage engine, enable
[`innodb_print_ddl_logs`](innodb-parameters.md#sysvar_innodb_print_ddl_logs) to have
MySQL write the DDL logs to `stderr`. Depending
on the host operating system and MySQL configuration,
`stderr` may be the error log, terminal, or
console window. See
[Section 7.4.2.2, “Default Error Log Destination Configuration”](error-log-destination-configuration.md "7.4.2.2 Default Error Log Destination Configuration").

`InnoDB` writes DDL logs to the
`mysql.innodb_ddl_log` table to support redo
and rollback of DDL operations. The
`mysql.innodb_ddl_log` table is a hidden data
dictionary table that resides in the
`mysql.ibd` data dictionary tablespace. Like
other hidden data dictionary tables, the
`mysql.innodb_ddl_log` table cannot be accessed
directly in non-debug versions of MySQL. (See
[Section 16.1, “Data Dictionary Schema”](data-dictionary-schema.md "16.1 Data Dictionary Schema").) The structure of the
`mysql.innodb_ddl_log` table corresponds to
this definition:

```sql
CREATE TABLE mysql.innodb_ddl_log (
  id BIGINT UNSIGNED NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
  thread_id BIGINT UNSIGNED NOT NULL,
  type INT UNSIGNED NOT NULL,
  space_id INT UNSIGNED,
  page_no INT UNSIGNED,
  index_id BIGINT UNSIGNED,
  table_id BIGINT UNSIGNED,
  old_file_path VARCHAR(512) COLLATE utf8mb4_bin,
  new_file_path VARCHAR(512) COLLATE utf8mb4_bin,
  KEY(thread_id)
);
```

- `id`: A unique identifier for a DDL log
  record.
- `thread_id`: Each DDL log record is
  assigned a `thread_id`, which is used to
  replay and remove DDL logs that belong to a particular DDL
  operation. DDL operations that involve multiple data file
  operations generate multiple DDL log records.
- `type`: The DDL operation type. Types
  include `FREE` (drop an index tree),
  `DELETE` (delete a file),
  `RENAME` (rename a file), or
  `DROP` (drop metadata from the
  `mysql.innodb_dynamic_metadata` data
  dictionary table).
- `space_id`: The tablespace ID.
- `page_no`: A page that contains allocation
  information; an index tree root page, for example.
- `index_id`: The index ID.
- `table_id`: The table ID.
- `old_file_path`: The old tablespace file
  path. Used by DDL operations that create or drop tablespace
  files; also used by DDL operations that rename a tablespace.
- `new_file_path`: The new tablespace file
  path. Used by DDL operations that rename tablespace files.

This example demonstrates enabling
[`innodb_print_ddl_logs`](innodb-parameters.md#sysvar_innodb_print_ddl_logs) to view
DDL logs written to `strderr` for a
`CREATE TABLE` operation.

```sql
mysql> SET GLOBAL innodb_print_ddl_logs=1;
mysql> CREATE TABLE t1 (c1 INT) ENGINE = InnoDB;
```

```none
[Note] [000000] InnoDB: DDL log insert : [DDL record: DELETE SPACE, id=18, thread_id=7,
space_id=5, old_file_path=./test/t1.ibd]
[Note] [000000] InnoDB: DDL log delete : by id 18
[Note] [000000] InnoDB: DDL log insert : [DDL record: REMOVE CACHE, id=19, thread_id=7,

```
