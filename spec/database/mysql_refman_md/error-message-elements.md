## B.1 Error Message Sources and Elements

This section discusses how error messages originate within MySQL
and the elements they contain.

- [Error Code Ranges](error-message-elements.md#error-code-ranges "Error Code Ranges")

### Error Message Sources

Error messages can originate on the server side or the client
side:

- On the server side, error messages may occur during the
  startup and shutdown processes, as a result of issues that
  occur during SQL statement execution, and so forth.

  - The MySQL server writes some error messages to its error
    log. These indicate issues of interest to database
    administrators or that require DBA action.
  - The server sends other error messages to client
    programs. These indicate issues pertaining only to a
    particular client. The MySQL client library takes errors
    received from the server and makes them available to the
    host client program.
- Client-side error messages are generated from within the
  MySQL client library, usually involving problems
  communicating with the server.

Example server-side error messages written to the error log:

- This message produced during the startup process provides a
  status or progress indicator:

  ```none
  2018-10-28T13:01:32.735983Z 0 [Note] [MY-010303] [Server] Skipping
  generation of SSL certificates as options related to SSL are specified.
  ```
- This message indicates an issue that requires DBA action:

  ```none
  2018-10-02T03:20:39.410387Z 768 [ERROR] [MY-010045] [Server] Event Scheduler:
  [evtuser@localhost][myschema.e_daily] Unknown database 'mydb'
  ```

Example server-side error message sent to client programs, as
displayed by the [**mysql**](mysql.md "6.5.1 mysql — The MySQL Command-Line Client") client:

```sql
mysql> SELECT * FROM no_such_table;
ERROR 1146 (42S02): Table 'test.no_such_table' doesn't exist
```

Example client-side error message originating from within the
client library, as displayed by the [**mysql**](mysql.md "6.5.1 mysql — The MySQL Command-Line Client")
client:

```terminal
$> mysql -h no-such-host
ERROR 2005 (HY000): Unknown MySQL server host 'no-such-host' (-2)
```

Whether an error originates from within the client library or is
received from the server, a MySQL client program may respond in
varying ways. As just illustrated, the client may display the
error message so the user can take corrective measures. The
client may instead internally attempt to resolve or retry a
failed operation, or take other action.

### Error Message Elements

When an error occurs, error information includes several
elements: an error code, SQLSTATE value, and message string.
These elements have the following characteristics:

- Error code: This value is numeric. It is MySQL-specific and
  is not portable to other database systems.

  Each error number has a corresponding symbolic value.
  Examples:

  - The symbol for server error number
    `1146` is
    [`ER_NO_SUCH_TABLE`](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/mysql-errors/8.0/en/server-error-reference.html#error_er_no_such_table).
  - The symbol for client error number
    `2005` is
    [`CR_UNKNOWN_HOST`](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/mysql-errors/8.0/en/client-error-reference.html#error_cr_unknown_host).

  The set of error codes used in error messages is partitioned
  into distinct ranges; see
  [Error Code Ranges](error-message-elements.md#error-code-ranges "Error Code Ranges").

  Error codes are stable across General Availability (GA)
  releases of a given MySQL series. Before a series reaches GA
  status, new codes may still be under development and are
  subject to change.
- SQLSTATE value: This value is a five-character string (for
  example, `'42S02'`). SQLSTATE values are
  taken from ANSI SQL and ODBC and are more standardized than
  the numeric error codes. The first two characters of an
  SQLSTATE value indicate the error class:

  - Class = `'00'` indicates success.
  - Class = `'01'` indicates a warning.
  - Class = `'02'` indicates “not
    found.” This is relevant within the context of
    cursors and is used to control what happens when a
    cursor reaches the end of a data set. This condition
    also occurs for `SELECT ... INTO
    var_list` statements
    that retrieve no rows.
  - Class > `'02'` indicates an
    exception.

  For server-side errors, not all MySQL error numbers have
  corresponding SQLSTATE values. In these cases,
  `'HY000'` (general error) is used.

  For client-side errors, the SQLSTATE value is always
  `'HY000'` (general error), so it is not
  meaningful for distinguishing one client error from another.
- Message string: This string provides a textual description
  of the error.

### Error Code Ranges

The set of error codes used in error messages is partitioned
into distinct ranges, each with its own purpose:

- 1 to 999: Global error codes. This error code range is
  called “global” because it is a shared range
  that is used by the server as well as by clients.

  When an error in this range originates on the server side,
  the server writes it to the error log, padding the error
  code with leading zeros to six digits and adding a prefix of
  `MY-`.

  When an error in this range originates on the client side,
  the client library makes it available to the client program
  with no zero-padding or prefix.
- 1,000 to 1,999: Server error codes reserved for messages
  sent to clients.
- 2,000 to 2,999: Client error codes reserved for use by the
  client library.
- 3,000 to 4,999: Server error codes reserved for messages
  sent to clients.
- 5,000 to 5,999: Error codes reserved for use by X Plugin
  for messages sent to clients.
- 10,000 to 49,999: Server error codes reserved for messages
  to be written to the error log (not sent to clients).

  When an error in this range occurs, the server writes it to
  the error log, padding the error code with leading zeros to
  six digits and adding a prefix of `MY-`.
- 50,000 to 51,999: Error codes reserved for use by third
  parties.

The server handles error messages written to the error log
differently from error messages sent to clients:

- When the server writes a message to the error log, it pads
  the error code with leading zeros to six digits and adds a
  prefix of `MY-` (examples:
  [`MY-000022`](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/mysql-errors/8.0/en/global-error-reference.html#error_ee_unknown_charset),
  [`MY-010048`](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/mysql-errors/8.0/en/server-error-reference.html#error_er_scheduler_stopped)).
- When the server sends a message to a client program, it adds
  no zero-padding or prefix to the error code (examples:
  [`1036`](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/mysql-errors/8.0/en/server-error-reference.html#error_er_open_as_readonly),
  [`3013`](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/mysql-errors/8.0/en/server-error-reference.html#error_er_invalid_field_size)).
