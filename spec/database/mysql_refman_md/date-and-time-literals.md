### 11.1.3 Date and Time Literals

- [Standard SQL and ODBC Date and Time Literals](date-and-time-literals.md#date-and-time-standard-sql-literals "Standard SQL and ODBC Date and Time Literals")
- [String and Numeric Literals in Date and Time Context](date-and-time-literals.md#date-and-time-string-numeric-literals "String and Numeric Literals in Date and Time Context")

Date and time values can be represented in several formats, such
as quoted strings or as numbers, depending on the exact type of
the value and other factors. For example, in contexts where
MySQL expects a date, it interprets any of
`'2015-07-21'`, `'20150721'`,
and `20150721` as a date.

This section describes the acceptable formats for date and time
literals. For more information about the temporal data types,
such as the range of permitted values, see
[Section 13.2, “Date and Time Data Types”](date-and-time-types.md "13.2 Date and Time Data Types").

#### Standard SQL and ODBC Date and Time Literals

Standard SQL requires temporal literals to be specified using
a type keyword and a string. The space between the keyword and
string is optional.

```sql
DATE 'str'
TIME 'str'
TIMESTAMP 'str'
```

MySQL recognizes but, unlike standard SQL, does not require
the type keyword. Applications that are to be
standard-compliant should include the type keyword for
temporal literals.

MySQL also recognizes the ODBC syntax corresponding to the
standard SQL syntax:

```clike
{ d 'str' }
{ t 'str' }
{ ts 'str' }
```

MySQL uses the type keywords and the ODBC constructions to
produce [`DATE`](datetime.md "13.2.2 The DATE, DATETIME, and TIMESTAMP Types"),
[`TIME`](time.md "13.2.3 The TIME Type"), and
[`DATETIME`](datetime.md "13.2.2 The DATE, DATETIME, and TIMESTAMP Types") values, respectively,
including a trailing fractional seconds part if specified. The
[`TIMESTAMP`](datetime.md "13.2.2 The DATE, DATETIME, and TIMESTAMP Types") syntax produces a
[`DATETIME`](datetime.md "13.2.2 The DATE, DATETIME, and TIMESTAMP Types") value in MySQL because
[`DATETIME`](datetime.md "13.2.2 The DATE, DATETIME, and TIMESTAMP Types") has a range that more
closely corresponds to the standard SQL
[`TIMESTAMP`](datetime.md "13.2.2 The DATE, DATETIME, and TIMESTAMP Types") type, which has a
year range from `0001` to
`9999`. (The MySQL
[`TIMESTAMP`](datetime.md "13.2.2 The DATE, DATETIME, and TIMESTAMP Types") year range is
`1970` to `2038`.)

#### String and Numeric Literals in Date and Time Context

MySQL recognizes [`DATE`](datetime.md "13.2.2 The DATE, DATETIME, and TIMESTAMP Types") values in
these formats:

- As a string in either
  `'YYYY-MM-DD'`
  or
  `'YY-MM-DD'`
  format. A “relaxed” syntax is permitted, but
  is deprecated: Any punctuation character may be used as
  the delimiter between date parts. For example,
  `'2012-12-31'`,
  `'2012/12/31'`,
  `'2012^12^31'`, and
  `'2012@12@31'` are equivalent. Beginning
  with MySQL 8.0.29, using any character other than the dash
  (`-`) as the delimiter raises a warning,
  as shown here:

  ```sql
  mysql> SELECT DATE'2012@12@31';
  +------------------+
  | DATE'2012@12@31' |
  +------------------+
  | 2012-12-31       |
  +------------------+
  1 row in set, 1 warning (0.00 sec)

  mysql> SHOW WARNINGS\G
  *************************** 1. row ***************************
    Level: Warning
     Code: 4095
  Message: Delimiter '@' in position 4 in datetime value '2012@12@31' at row 1 is
  deprecated. Prefer the standard '-'.
  1 row in set (0.00 sec)
  ```
- As a string with no delimiters in either
  `'YYYYMMDD'`
  or `'YYMMDD'`
  format, provided that the string makes sense as a date.
  For example, `'20070523'` and
  `'070523'` are interpreted as
  `'2007-05-23'`, but
  `'071332'` is illegal (it has nonsensical
  month and day parts) and becomes
  `'0000-00-00'`.
- As a number in either *`YYYYMMDD`*
  or *`YYMMDD`* format, provided that
  the number makes sense as a date. For example,
  `19830905` and `830905`
  are interpreted as `'1983-09-05'`.

MySQL recognizes [`DATETIME`](datetime.md "13.2.2 The DATE, DATETIME, and TIMESTAMP Types") and
[`TIMESTAMP`](datetime.md "13.2.2 The DATE, DATETIME, and TIMESTAMP Types") values in these
formats:

- As a string in either `'YYYY-MM-DD
  hh:mm:ss'` or
  `'YY-MM-DD
  hh:mm:ss'` format. MySQL also
  permits a “relaxed” syntax here, although
  this is deprecated: Any punctuation character may be used
  as the delimiter between date parts or time parts. For
  example, `'2012-12-31 11:30:45'`,
  `'2012^12^31 11+30+45'`,
  `'2012/12/31 11*30*45'`, and
  `'2012@12@31 11^30^45'` are equivalent.
  Beginning with MySQL 8.0.29, use of any characters as
  delimiters in such values, other than the dash
  (`-`) for the date part and the colon
  (`:`) for the time part, raises a
  warning, as shown here:

  ```sql
  mysql> SELECT TIMESTAMP'2012^12^31 11*30*45';
  +--------------------------------+
  | TIMESTAMP'2012^12^31 11*30*45' |
  +--------------------------------+
  | 2012-12-31 11:30:45            |
  +--------------------------------+
  1 row in set, 1 warning (0.00 sec)

  mysql> SHOW WARNINGS\G
  *************************** 1. row ***************************
    Level: Warning
     Code: 4095
  Message: Delimiter '^' in position 4 in datetime value '2012^12^31 11*30*45' at
  row 1 is deprecated. Prefer the standard '-'.
  1 row in set (0.00 sec)
  ```

  The only delimiter recognized between a date and time part
  and a fractional seconds part is the decimal point.

  The date and time parts can be separated by
  `T` rather than a space. For example,
  `'2012-12-31 11:30:45'`
  `'2012-12-31T11:30:45'` are equivalent.

  Previously, MySQL supported arbitrary numbers of leading
  and trailing whitespace characters in date and time
  values, as well as between the date and time parts of
  `DATETIME` and
  `TIMESTAMP` values. In MySQL 8.0.29 and
  later, this behavior is deprecated, and the presence of
  excess whitespace characters triggers a warning, as shown
  here:

  ```sql
  mysql> SELECT TIMESTAMP'2012-12-31   11-30-45';
  +----------------------------------+
  | TIMESTAMP'2012-12-31   11-30-45' |
  +----------------------------------+
  | 2012-12-31 11:30:45              |
  +----------------------------------+
  1 row in set, 1 warning (0.00 sec)

  mysql> SHOW WARNINGS\G
  *************************** 1. row ***************************
    Level: Warning
     Code: 4096
  Message: Delimiter ' ' in position 11 in datetime value '2012-12-31   11-30-45'
  at row 1 is superfluous and is deprecated. Please remove.
  1 row in set (0.00 sec)
  ```

  Also beginning with MySQL 8.0.29, a warning is raised when
  whitespace characters other than the space character is
  used, like this:

  ```sql
  mysql> SELECT TIMESTAMP'2021-06-06
      '> 11:15:25';
  +--------------------------------+
  | TIMESTAMP'2021-06-06
   11:15:25'                       |
  +--------------------------------+
  | 2021-06-06 11:15:25            |
  +--------------------------------+
  1 row in set, 1 warning (0.00 sec)

  mysql> SHOW WARNINGS\G
  *************************** 1. row ***************************
    Level: Warning
     Code: 4095
  Message: Delimiter '\n' in position 10 in datetime value '2021-06-06
  11:15:25' at row 1 is deprecated. Prefer the standard ' '.
  1 row in set (0.00 sec)
  ```

  Only one such warning is raised per temporal value, even
  though multiple issues may exist with delimiters,
  whitespace, or both, as shown in the following series of
  statements:

  ```sql
  mysql> SELECT TIMESTAMP'2012!-12-31  11:30:45';
  +----------------------------------+
  | TIMESTAMP'2012!-12-31  11:30:45' |
  +----------------------------------+
  | 2012-12-31 11:30:45              |

  ```
- As a string with no delimiters in either
  `'YYYYMMDDhhmmss'`
  or
  `'YYMMDDhhmmss'`
  format, provided that the string makes sense as a date.
  For example, `'20070523091528'` and
  `'070523091528'` are interpreted as
  `'2007-05-23 09:15:28'`, but
  `'071122129015'` is illegal (it has a
  nonsensical minute part) and becomes `'0000-00-00
  00:00:00'`.
- As a number in either
  *`YYYYMMDDhhmmss`* or
  *`YYMMDDhhmmss`* format, provided
  that the number makes sense as a date. For example,
  `19830905132800` and
  `830905132800` are interpreted as
  `'1983-09-05 13:28:00'`.

A [`DATETIME`](datetime.md "13.2.2 The DATE, DATETIME, and TIMESTAMP Types") or
[`TIMESTAMP`](datetime.md "13.2.2 The DATE, DATETIME, and TIMESTAMP Types") value can include a
trailing fractional seconds part in up to microseconds (6
digits) precision. The fractional part should always be
separated from the rest of the time by a decimal point; no
other fractional seconds delimiter is recognized. For
information about fractional seconds support in MySQL, see
[Section 13.2.6, “Fractional Seconds in Time Values”](fractional-seconds.md "13.2.6 Fractional Seconds in Time Values").

Dates containing two-digit year values are ambiguous because
the century is unknown. MySQL interprets two-digit year values
using these rules:

- Year values in the range `70-99` become
  `1970-1999`.
- Year values in the range `00-69` become
  `2000-2069`.

See also [Section 13.2.9, “2-Digit Years in Dates”](two-digit-years.md "13.2.9 2-Digit Years in Dates").

For values specified as strings that include date part
delimiters, it is unnecessary to specify two digits for month
or day values that are less than `10`.
`'2015-6-9'` is the same as
`'2015-06-09'`. Similarly, for values
specified as strings that include time part delimiters, it is
unnecessary to specify two digits for hour, minute, or second
values that are less than `10`.
`'2015-10-30 1:2:3'` is the same as
`'2015-10-30 01:02:03'`.

Values specified as numbers should be 6, 8, 12, or 14 digits
long. If a number is 8 or 14 digits long, it is assumed to be
in *`YYYYMMDD`* or
*`YYYYMMDDhhmmss`* format and that the
year is given by the first 4 digits. If the number is 6 or 12
digits long, it is assumed to be in
*`YYMMDD`* or
*`YYMMDDhhmmss`* format and that the
year is given by the first 2 digits. Numbers that are not one
of these lengths are interpreted as though padded with leading
zeros to the closest length.

Values specified as nondelimited strings are interpreted
according their length. For a string 8 or 14 characters long,
the year is assumed to be given by the first 4 characters.
Otherwise, the year is assumed to be given by the first 2
characters. The string is interpreted from left to right to
find year, month, day, hour, minute, and second values, for as
many parts as are present in the string. This means you should
not use strings that have fewer than 6 characters. For
example, if you specify `'9903'`, thinking
that represents March, 1999, MySQL converts it to the
“zero” date value. This occurs because the year
and month values are `99` and
`03`, but the day part is completely missing.
However, you can explicitly specify a value of zero to
represent missing month or day parts. For example, to insert
the value `'1999-03-00'`, use
`'990300'`.

MySQL recognizes [`TIME`](time.md "13.2.3 The TIME Type") values in
these formats:

- As a string in *`'D hh:mm:ss'`*
  format. You can also use one of the following
  “relaxed” syntaxes:
  *`'hh:mm:ss'`*,
  *`'hh:mm'`*, *`'D
  hh:mm'`*, *`'D hh'`*,
  or *`'ss'`*. Here
  *`D`* represents days and can have
  a value from 0 to 34.
- As a string with no delimiters in
  *`'hhmmss'`* format, provided that
  it makes sense as a time. For example,
  `'101112'` is understood as
  `'10:11:12'`, but
  `'109712'` is illegal (it has a
  nonsensical minute part) and becomes
  `'00:00:00'`.
- As a number in *`hhmmss`* format,
  provided that it makes sense as a time. For example,
  `101112` is understood as
  `'10:11:12'`. The following alternative
  formats are also understood:
  *`ss`*,
  *`mmss`*, or
  *`hhmmss`*.

A trailing fractional seconds part is recognized in the
*`'D hh:mm:ss.fraction'`*,
*`'hh:mm:ss.fraction'`*,
*`'hhmmss.fraction'`*, and
*`hhmmss.fraction`* time formats, where
`fraction` is the fractional part in up to
microseconds (6 digits) precision. The fractional part should
always be separated from the rest of the time by a decimal
point; no other fractional seconds delimiter is recognized.
For information about fractional seconds support in MySQL, see
[Section 13.2.6, “Fractional Seconds in Time Values”](fractional-seconds.md "13.2.6 Fractional Seconds in Time Values").

For [`TIME`](time.md "13.2.3 The TIME Type") values specified as
strings that include a time part delimiter, it is unnecessary
to specify two digits for hours, minutes, or seconds values
that are less than `10`.
`'8:3:2'` is the same as
`'08:03:02'`.

Beginning with MySQL 8.0.19, you can specify a time zone
offset when inserting `TIMESTAMP` and
`DATETIME` values into a table. The offset is
appended to the time part of a datetime literal, with no
intravening spaces, and uses the same format used for setting
the [`time_zone`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_time_zone) system
variable, with the following exceptions:

- For hour values less than 10, a leading zero is required.
- The value `'-00:00'` is rejected.
- Time zone names such as `'EET'` and
  `'Asia/Shanghai'` cannot be used;
  `'SYSTEM'` also cannot be used in this
  context.

The value inserted must not have a zero for the month part,
the day part, or both parts. This is enforced beginning with
MySQL 8.0.22, regardless of the server SQL mode setting.

This example illustrates inserting datetime values with time
zone offsets into `TIMESTAMP` and
`DATETIME` columns using different
[`time_zone`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_time_zone) settings, and then
retrieving them:

```sql
mysql> CREATE TABLE ts (
    ->     id INTEGER NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
    ->     col TIMESTAMP NOT NULL
    -> ) AUTO_INCREMENT = 1;

mysql> CREATE TABLE dt (
    ->     id INT NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
    ->     col DATETIME NOT NULL

The offset is not displayed when selecting a datetime value,
even if one was used when inserting it.

The range of supported offset values is
`-13:59` to `+14:00`,
inclusive.

Datetime literals that include time zone offsets are accepted
as parameter values by prepared statements.
