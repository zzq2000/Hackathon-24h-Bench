#### 8.1.2.3 Passwords and Logging

Passwords can be written as plain text in SQL statements such as
[`CREATE USER`](create-user.md "15.7.1.3 CREATE USER Statement"),
[`GRANT`](grant.md "15.7.1.6 GRANT Statement") and
[`SET PASSWORD`](set-password.md "15.7.1.10 SET PASSWORD Statement"). If such statements
are logged by the MySQL server as written, passwords in them
become visible to anyone with access to the logs.

Statement logging avoids writing passwords as cleartext for the
following statements:

```sql
CREATE USER ... IDENTIFIED BY ...
ALTER USER ... IDENTIFIED BY ...
SET PASSWORD ...
START SLAVE ... PASSWORD = ...
START REPLICA ... PASSWORD = ...
CREATE SERVER ... OPTIONS(... PASSWORD ...)
ALTER SERVER ... OPTIONS(... PASSWORD ...)
```

Passwords in those statements are rewritten to not appear
literally in statement text written to the general query log,
slow query log, and binary log. Rewriting does not apply to
other statements. In particular,
[`INSERT`](insert.md "15.2.7 INSERT Statement") or
[`UPDATE`](update.md "15.2.17 UPDATE Statement") statements for the
`mysql.user` system table that refer to literal
passwords are logged as is, so you should avoid such statements.
(Direct modification of grant tables is discouraged, anyway.)

For the general query log, password rewriting can be suppressed
by starting the server with the
[`--log-raw`](server-options.md#option_mysqld_log-raw) option. For security
reasons, this option is not recommended for production use. For
diagnostic purposes, it may be useful to see the exact text of
statements as received by the server.

By default, contents of audit log files produced by the audit
log plugin are not encrypted and may contain sensitive
information, such as the text of SQL statements. For security
reasons, audit log files should be written to a directory
accessible only to the MySQL server and to users with a
legitimate reason to view the log. See
[Section 8.4.5.3, “MySQL Enterprise Audit Security Considerations”](audit-log-security.md "8.4.5.3 MySQL Enterprise Audit Security Considerations").

Statements received by the server may be rewritten if a query
rewrite plugin is installed (see
[Query Rewrite Plugins](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/extending-mysql/8.0/en/plugin-types.html#query-rewrite-plugin-type)). In this case, the
[`--log-raw`](server-options.md#option_mysqld_log-raw) option affects
statement logging as follows:

- Without [`--log-raw`](server-options.md#option_mysqld_log-raw), the server
  logs the statement returned by the query rewrite plugin.
  This may differ from the statement as received.
- With [`--log-raw`](server-options.md#option_mysqld_log-raw), the server
  logs the original statement as received.

An implication of password rewriting is that statements that
cannot be parsed (due, for example, to syntax errors) are not
written to the general query log because they cannot be known to
be password free. Use cases that require logging of all
statements including those with errors should use the
[`--log-raw`](server-options.md#option_mysqld_log-raw) option, bearing in mind
that this also bypasses password rewriting.

Password rewriting occurs only when plain text passwords are
expected. For statements with syntax that expect a password hash
value, no rewriting occurs. If a plain text password is supplied
erroneously for such syntax, the password is logged as given,
without rewriting.

To guard log files against unwarranted exposure, locate them in
a directory that restricts access to the server and the database
administrator. If the server logs to tables in the
`mysql` database, grant access to those tables
only to the database administrator.

Replicas store the password for the replication source server in
their connection metadata repository, which by default is a
table in the `mysql` database named
`slave_master_info`. The use of a file in the
data directory for the connection metadata repository is now
deprecated, but still possible (see
[Section 19.2.4, “Relay Log and Replication Metadata Repositories”](replica-logs.md "19.2.4 Relay Log and Replication Metadata Repositories")). Ensure that the connection
metadata repository can be accessed only by the database
administrator. An alternative to storing the password in the
connection metadata repository is to use the
[`START
REPLICA`](start-replica.md "15.4.2.6 START REPLICA Statement") (or before MySQL 8.0.22,
[`START
SLAVE`](start-slave.md "15.4.2.7 START SLAVE Statement")) or [`START
GROUP_REPLICATION`](start-group-replication.md "15.4.3.1 START GROUP_REPLICATION Statement") statement to specify credentials for
connecting to the source.

Use a restricted access mode to protect database backups that
include log tables or log files containing passwords.
