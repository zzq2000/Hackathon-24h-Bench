### 13.4.1 Spatial Data Types

MySQL has spatial data types that correspond to OpenGIS classes.
The basis for these types is described in
[Section 13.4.2, “The OpenGIS Geometry Model”](opengis-geometry-model.md "13.4.2 The OpenGIS Geometry Model").

Some spatial data types hold single geometry values:

- `GEOMETRY`
- `POINT`
- `LINESTRING`
- `POLYGON`

`GEOMETRY` can store geometry values of any
type. The other single-value types (`POINT`,
`LINESTRING`, and `POLYGON`)
restrict their values to a particular geometry type.

The other spatial data types hold collections of values:

- `MULTIPOINT`
- `MULTILINESTRING`
- `MULTIPOLYGON`
- `GEOMETRYCOLLECTION`

`GEOMETRYCOLLECTION` can store a collection of
objects of any type. The other collection types
(`MULTIPOINT`,
`MULTILINESTRING`, and
`MULTIPOLYGON`) restrict collection members to
those having a particular geometry type.

Example: To create a table named `geom` that
has a column named `g` that can store values of
any geometry type, use this statement:

```sql
CREATE TABLE geom (g GEOMETRY);
```

Columns with a spatial data type can have an
`SRID` attribute, to explicitly indicate the
spatial reference system (SRS) for values stored in the column.
For example:

```sql
CREATE TABLE geom (
    p POINT SRID 0,
    g GEOMETRY NOT NULL SRID 4326
);
```

`SPATIAL` indexes can be created on spatial
columns if they are `NOT NULL` and have a
specific SRID, so if you plan to index the column, declare it
with the `NOT NULL` and `SRID`
attributes:

```sql
CREATE TABLE geom (g GEOMETRY NOT NULL SRID 4326);
```

`InnoDB` tables permit `SRID`
values for Cartesian and geographic SRSs.
`MyISAM` tables permit `SRID`
values for Cartesian SRSs.

The `SRID` attribute makes a spatial column
SRID-restricted, which has these implications:

- The column can contain only values with the given SRID.
  Attempts to insert values with a different SRID produce an
  error.
- The optimizer can use `SPATIAL` indexes on
  the column. See
  [Section 10.3.3, “SPATIAL Index Optimization”](spatial-index-optimization.md "10.3.3 SPATIAL Index Optimization").

Spatial columns with no `SRID` attribute are
not SRID-restricted and accept values with any SRID. However,
the optimizer cannot use `SPATIAL` indexes on
them until the column definition is modified to include an
`SRID` attribute, which may require that the
column contents first be modified so that all values have the
same SRID.

For other examples showing how to use spatial data types in
MySQL, see [Section 13.4.6, “Creating Spatial Columns”](creating-spatial-columns.md "13.4.6 Creating Spatial Columns"). For
