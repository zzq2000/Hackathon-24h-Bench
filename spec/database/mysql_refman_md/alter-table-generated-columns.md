#### 15.1.9.2 ALTER TABLE and Generated Columns

`ALTER TABLE` operations permitted for
generated columns are `ADD`,
`MODIFY`, and `CHANGE`.

- Generated columns can be added.

  ```sql
  CREATE TABLE t1 (c1 INT);
  ALTER TABLE t1 ADD COLUMN c2 INT GENERATED ALWAYS AS (c1 + 1) STORED;
  ```
- The data type and expression of generated columns can be
  modified.

  ```sql
  CREATE TABLE t1 (c1 INT, c2 INT GENERATED ALWAYS AS (c1 + 1) STORED);
  ALTER TABLE t1 MODIFY COLUMN c2 TINYINT GENERATED ALWAYS AS (c1 + 5) STORED;
  ```
- Generated columns can be renamed or dropped, if no other
  column refers to them.

  ```sql
  CREATE TABLE t1 (c1 INT, c2 INT GENERATED ALWAYS AS (c1 + 1) STORED);
  ALTER TABLE t1 CHANGE c2 c3 INT GENERATED ALWAYS AS (c1 + 1) STORED;
  ALTER TABLE t1 DROP COLUMN c3;
  ```
- Virtual generated columns cannot be altered to stored
  generated columns, or vice versa. To work around this, drop
  the column, then add it with the new definition.

  ```sql
  CREATE TABLE t1 (c1 INT, c2 INT GENERATED ALWAYS AS (c1 + 1) VIRTUAL);
  ALTER TABLE t1 DROP COLUMN c2;
  ALTER TABLE t1 ADD COLUMN c2 INT GENERATED ALWAYS AS (c1 + 1) STORED;
  ```
- Nongenerated columns can be altered to stored but not
  virtual generated columns.

  ```sql
  CREATE TABLE t1 (c1 INT, c2 INT);
  ALTER TABLE t1 MODIFY COLUMN c2 INT GENERATED ALWAYS AS (c1 + 1) STORED;
  ```
- Stored but not virtual generated columns can be altered to
  nongenerated columns. The stored generated values become the
  values of the nongenerated column.

  ```sql
  CREATE TABLE t1 (c1 INT, c2 INT GENERATED ALWAYS AS (c1 + 1) STORED);
  ALTER TABLE t1 MODIFY COLUMN c2 INT;
  ```
- `ADD COLUMN` is not an in-place operation
  for stored columns (done without using a temporary table)
  because the expression must be evaluated by the server. For
  stored columns, indexing changes are done in place, and
  expression changes are not done in place. Changes to column
  comments are done in place.
- For non-partitioned tables, `ADD COLUMN`
  and `DROP COLUMN` are in-place operations
  for virtual columns. However, adding or dropping a virtual
  column cannot be performed in place in combination with
  other [`ALTER TABLE`](alter-table.md "15.1.9 ALTER TABLE Statement") operations.

  For partitioned tables, `ADD COLUMN` and
  `DROP COLUMN` are not in-place operations
  for virtual columns.
- `InnoDB` supports secondary indexes on
  virtual generated columns. Adding or dropping a secondary
  index on a virtual generated column is an in-place
  operation. For more information, see
  [Section 15.1.20.9, “Secondary Indexes and Generated Columns”](create-table-secondary-indexes.md "15.1.20.9 Secondary Indexes and Generated Columns").
- When a `VIRTUAL` generated column is added
  to a table or modified, it is not ensured that data being
  calculated by the generated column expression is not out of
  range for the column. This can lead to inconsistent data
  being returned and unexpectedly failed statements. To permit
  control over whether validation occurs for such columns,
  `ALTER TABLE` supports `WITHOUT
  VALIDATION` and `WITH VALIDATION`
  clauses:

  - With `WITHOUT VALIDATION` (the default
    if neither clause is specified), an in-place operation
    is performed (if possible), data integrity is not
    checked, and the statement finishes more quickly.
    However, later reads from the table might report
    warnings or errors for the column if values are out of
    range.
  - With `WITH VALIDATION`, `ALTER
    TABLE` copies the table. If an out-of-range or
    any other error occurs, the statement fails. Because a
    table copy is performed, the statement takes longer.

  `WITHOUT VALIDATION` and `WITH
  VALIDATION` are permitted only with `ADD
  COLUMN`, `CHANGE COLUMN`, and
  `MODIFY COLUMN` operations. Otherwise, an
  [`ER_WRONG_USAGE`](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/mysql-errors/8.0/en/server-error-reference.html#error_er_wrong_usage) error occurs.
- If expression evaluation causes truncation or provides
  incorrect input to a function, the
  [`ALTER TABLE`](alter-table.md "15.1.9 ALTER TABLE Statement") statement
  terminates with an error and the DDL operation is rejected.
- An [`ALTER TABLE`](alter-table.md "15.1.9 ALTER TABLE Statement") statement that
  changes the default value of a column
  *`col_name`* may also change the
  value of a generated column expression that refers to the
  column using *`col_name`*, which may
  change the value of a generated column expression that
  refers to the column using
  [`DEFAULT(col_name)`](miscellaneous-functions.md#function_default).
  For this reason, [`ALTER TABLE`](alter-table.md "15.1.9 ALTER TABLE Statement")
  operations that change the definition of a column cause a
  table rebuild if any generated column expression uses
  [`DEFAULT()`](miscellaneous-functions.md#function_default).
