### 28.3.24 The INFORMATION\_SCHEMA PROFILING Table

The [`PROFILING`](information-schema-profiling-table.md "28.3.24 The INFORMATION_SCHEMA PROFILING Table") table provides
statement profiling information. Its contents correspond to the
information produced by the [`SHOW
PROFILE`](show-profile.md "15.7.7.30 SHOW PROFILE Statement") and [`SHOW PROFILES`](show-profiles.md "15.7.7.31 SHOW PROFILES Statement")
statements (see [Section 15.7.7.30, “SHOW PROFILE Statement”](show-profile.md "15.7.7.30 SHOW PROFILE Statement")). The table is
empty unless the [`profiling`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_profiling)
session variable is set to 1.

Note

This table is deprecated; expect it to be removed in a future
MySQL release. Use the
[Performance Schema](performance-schema.md "Chapter 29 MySQL Performance Schema")
instead; see
[Section 29.19.1, “Query Profiling Using Performance Schema”](performance-schema-query-profiling.md "29.19.1 Query Profiling Using Performance Schema").

The [`PROFILING`](information-schema-profiling-table.md "28.3.24 The INFORMATION_SCHEMA PROFILING Table") table has these
columns:

- `QUERY_ID`

  A numeric statement identifier.
- `SEQ`

  A sequence number indicating the display order for rows with
  the same `QUERY_ID` value.
- `STATE`

  The profiling state to which the row measurements apply.
- `DURATION`

  How long statement execution remained in the given state, in
  seconds.
- `CPU_USER`, `CPU_SYSTEM`

  User and system CPU use, in seconds.
- `CONTEXT_VOLUNTARY`,
  `CONTEXT_INVOLUNTARY`

  How many voluntary and involuntary context switches occurred.
- `BLOCK_OPS_IN`,
  `BLOCK_OPS_OUT`

  The number of block input and output operations.
- `MESSAGES_SENT`,
  `MESSAGES_RECEIVED`

  The number of communication messages sent and received.
- `PAGE_FAULTS_MAJOR`,
  `PAGE_FAULTS_MINOR`

  The number of major and minor page faults.
- `SWAPS`

  How many swaps occurred.
- `SOURCE_FUNCTION`,
  `SOURCE_FILE`, and
  `SOURCE_LINE`

  Information indicating where in the source code the profiled
  state executes.

#### Notes

- [`PROFILING`](information-schema-profiling-table.md "28.3.24 The INFORMATION_SCHEMA PROFILING Table") is a nonstandard
  `INFORMATION_SCHEMA` table.

Profiling information is also available from the
[`SHOW PROFILE`](show-profile.md "15.7.7.30 SHOW PROFILE Statement") and
[`SHOW PROFILES`](show-profiles.md "15.7.7.31 SHOW PROFILES Statement") statements. See
[Section 15.7.7.30, “SHOW PROFILE Statement”](show-profile.md "15.7.7.30 SHOW PROFILE Statement"). For example, the following queries
are equivalent:

```sql
SHOW PROFILE FOR QUERY 2;

SELECT STATE, FORMAT(DURATION, 6) AS DURATION
FROM INFORMATION_SCHEMA.PROFILING
WHERE QUERY_ID = 2 ORDER BY SEQ;
```
