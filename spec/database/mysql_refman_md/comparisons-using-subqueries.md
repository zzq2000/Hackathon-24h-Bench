#### 15.2.15.2 Comparisons Using Subqueries

The most common use of a subquery is in the form:

```sql
non_subquery_operand comparison_operator (subquery)
```

Where *`comparison_operator`* is one of
these operators:

```sql
=  >  <  >=  <=  <>  !=  <=>
```

For example:

```sql
... WHERE 'a' = (SELECT column1 FROM t1)
```

MySQL also permits this construct:

```sql
non_subquery_operand LIKE (subquery)
```

At one time the only legal place for a subquery was on the right
side of a comparison, and you might still find some old DBMSs
that insist on this.

Here is an example of a common-form subquery comparison that you
cannot do with a join. It finds all the rows in table
`t1` for which the `column1`
value is equal to a maximum value in table
`t2`:

```sql
SELECT * FROM t1
  WHERE column1 = (SELECT MAX(column2) FROM t2);
```

Here is another example, which again is impossible with a join
because it involves aggregating for one of the tables. It finds
all rows in table `t1` containing a value that
occurs twice in a given column:

```sql
SELECT * FROM t1 AS t
  WHERE 2 = (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM t1 WHERE t1.id = t.id);
```

For a comparison of the subquery to a scalar, the subquery must
return a scalar. For a comparison of the subquery to a row
constructor, the subquery must be a row subquery that returns a
row with the same number of values as the row constructor. See
[Section 15.2.15.5, “Row Subqueries”](row-subqueries.md "15.2.15.5 Row Subqueries").
