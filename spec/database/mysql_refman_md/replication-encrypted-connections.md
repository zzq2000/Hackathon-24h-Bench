### 19.3.1 Setting Up Replication to Use Encrypted Connections

To use an encrypted connection for the transfer of the binary log
required during replication, both the source and the replica
servers must support encrypted network connections. If either
server does not support encrypted connections (because it has not
been compiled or configured for them), replication through an
encrypted connection is not possible.

Setting up encrypted connections for replication is similar to
doing so for client/server connections. You must obtain (or
create) a suitable security certificate that you can use on the
source, and a similar certificate (from the same certificate
authority) on each replica. You must also obtain suitable key
files.

For more information on setting up a server and client for
encrypted connections, see
[Section 8.3.1, “Configuring MySQL to Use Encrypted Connections”](using-encrypted-connections.md "8.3.1 Configuring MySQL to Use Encrypted Connections").

To enable encrypted connections on the source, you must create or
obtain suitable certificate and key files, and then add the
following configuration parameters to the
`[mysqld]` section of the source
`my.cnf` file, changing the file names as
necessary:

```ini
[mysqld]
ssl_ca=cacert.pem
ssl_cert=server-cert.pem
ssl_key=server-key.pem
```

The paths to the files may be relative or absolute; we recommend
that you always use complete paths for this purpose.

The configuration parameters are as follows:

- [`ssl_ca`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_ssl_ca): The path name of the
  Certificate Authority (CA) certificate file.
  ([`ssl_capath`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_ssl_capath) is similar but
  specifies the path name of a directory of CA certificate
  files.)
- [`ssl_cert`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_ssl_cert): The path name of
  the server public key certificate file. This certificate can
  be sent to the client and authenticated against the CA
  certificate that it has.
- [`ssl_key`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_ssl_key): The path name of the
  server private key file.

To enable encrypted connections on the replica, use the
[`CHANGE REPLICATION SOURCE TO`](change-replication-source-to.md "15.4.2.3 CHANGE REPLICATION SOURCE TO Statement")
statement (MySQL 8.0.23 and later) or [`CHANGE
MASTER TO`](change-master-to.md "15.4.2.1 CHANGE MASTER TO Statement") statement (prior to MySQL 8.0.23).

- To name the replica's certificate and SSL private key
  files using [`CHANGE REPLICATION SOURCE
  TO`](change-replication-source-to.md "15.4.2.3 CHANGE REPLICATION SOURCE TO Statement") ([`CHANGE MASTER
  TO`](change-master-to.md "15.4.2.1 CHANGE MASTER TO Statement")), add the appropriate
  `SOURCE_SSL_xxx`
  (`MASTER_SSL_xxx`)
  options, like this:

  ```sql
      -> SOURCE_SSL_CA = 'ca_file_name',
      -> SOURCE_SSL_CAPATH = 'ca_directory_name',
      -> SOURCE_SSL_CERT = 'cert_file_name',
      -> SOURCE_SSL_KEY = 'key_file_name',
  ```

  These options correspond to the
  `--ssl-xxx` options
  with the same names, as described in
  [Command Options for Encrypted Connections](connection-options.md#encrypted-connection-options "Command Options for Encrypted Connections"). For these
  options to take effect, `SOURCE_SSL=1` must
  also be set. For a replication connection, specifying a value
  for either of `SOURCE_SSL_CA` or
  `SOURCE_SSL_CAPATH` corresponds to setting
  `--ssl-mode=VERIFY_CA`. The connection attempt
  succeeds only if a valid matching Certificate Authority (CA)
  certificate is found using the specified information.
- To activate host name identity verification, add the
  `SOURCE_SSL_VERIFY_SERVER_CERT` option, like
  this:

  ```sql
      -> SOURCE_SSL_VERIFY_SERVER_CERT=1,
  ```

  This option corresponds to the
  `--ssl-verify-server-cert` option, which is
  deprecated in MySQL 5.7 and removed in MySQL 8.0. For a
  replication connection, specifying
  `MASTER_SSL_VERIFY_SERVER_CERT=1` corresponds
  to setting `--ssl-mode=VERIFY_IDENTITY`, as
  described in [Command Options for Encrypted Connections](connection-options.md#encrypted-connection-options "Command Options for Encrypted Connections").
  For this option to take effect,
  `SOURCE_SSL=1` must also be set. Host name
  identity verification does not work with self-signed
  certificates.
- To activate certificate revocation list (CRL) checks, add the
  `SOURCE_SSL_CRL` or
  `SOURCE_SSL_CRLPATH` option, as shown here:

  ```sql
      -> SOURCE_SSL_CRL = 'crl_file_name',
      -> SOURCE_SSL_CRLPATH = 'crl_directory_name',
  ```

  These options correspond to the
  `--ssl-xxx` options
  with the same names, as described in
  [Command Options for Encrypted Connections](connection-options.md#encrypted-connection-options "Command Options for Encrypted Connections"). If they are
  not specified, no CRL checking takes place.
- To specify lists of ciphers, ciphersuites, and encryption
  protocols permitted by the replica for the replication
  connection, use the `SOURCE_SSL_CIPHER`,
  `SOURCE_TLS_VERSION`, and
  `SOURCE_TLS_CIPHERSUITES` options, like this:

  ```sql
      -> SOURCE_SSL_CIPHER = 'cipher_list',
      -> SOURCE_TLS_VERSION = 'protocol_list',
      -> SOURCE_TLS_CIPHERSUITES = 'ciphersuite_list',
  ```

  - The `SOURCE_SSL_CIPHER` option specifies
    a colon-separated list of one or more ciphers permitted by
    the replica for the replication connection.
  - The `SOURCE_TLS_VERSION` option specifies
    a comma-separated list of the TLS encryption protocols
    permitted by the replica for the replication connection,
    in a format like that for the
    [`tls_version`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_tls_version) server system
    variable. The connection procedure negotiates the use of
    the highest TLS version that both the source and the
    replica permit. To be able to connect, the replica must
    have at least one TLS version in common with the source.
  - The `SOURCE_TLS_CIPHERSUITES` option
    (available beginning with MySQL 8.0.19) specifies a
    colon-separated list of one or more ciphersuites that are
    permitted by the replica for the replication connection if
    TLSv1.3 is used for the connection. If this option is set
    to `NULL` when TLSv1.3 is used (which is
    the default if you do not set the option), the
    ciphersuites that are enabled by default are allowed. If
    you set the option to an empty string, no cipher suites
    are allowed, and TLSv1.3 is therefore not used.

  The protocols, ciphers, and ciphersuites that you can specify
  in these lists depend on the SSL library used to compile
  MySQL. For information about the formats, the permitted
  values, and the defaults if you do not specify the options,
  see [Section 8.3.2, “Encrypted Connection TLS Protocols and Ciphers”](encrypted-connection-protocols-ciphers.md "8.3.2 Encrypted Connection TLS Protocols and Ciphers").

  Note

  In MySQL 8.0.16 through 8.0.18, MySQL supports TLSv1.3, but
  the `SOURCE_TLS_CIPHERSUITES` option is not
  available. In these releases, if TLSv1.3 is used for
  connections between a source and replica, the source must
  permit the use of at least one TLSv1.3 ciphersuite that is
  enabled by default. From MySQL 8.0.19, you can use the
  option to specify any selection of ciphersuites, including
  only non-default ciphersuites if you want.
- After the source information has been updated, start the
  replication process on the replica, like this:

  ```sql
  mysql> START SLAVE;
  ```

  Beginning with MySQL 8.0.22, `START REPLICA`
  is preferred, as shown here:

  ```sql
  mysql> START REPLICA;
  ```

  You can use the [`SHOW REPLICA
  STATUS`](show-replica-status.md "15.7.7.35 SHOW REPLICA STATUS Statement") (prior to MySQL 8.0.22,
  [`SHOW SLAVE STATUS`](show-slave-status.md "15.7.7.36 SHOW SLAVE | REPLICA STATUS Statement")) statement to
  confirm that an encrypted connection was established
  successfully.
- Requiring encrypted connections on the replica does not ensure
  that the source requires encrypted connections from replicas.
  If you want to ensure that the source only accepts replicas
  that connect using encrypted connections, create a replication
  user account on the source using the `REQUIRE
  SSL` option, then grant that user the
  [`REPLICATION SLAVE`](privileges-provided.md#priv_replication-slave) privilege.
  For example:

  ```sql
  mysql> CREATE USER 'repl'@'%.example.com' IDENTIFIED BY 'password'
      -> REQUIRE SSL;
  mysql> GRANT REPLICATION SLAVE ON *.*
      -> TO 'repl'@'%.example.com';
  ```

  If you have an existing replication user account on the
  source, you can add `REQUIRE SSL` to it with
  this statement:

  ```sql
  mysql> ALTER USER 'repl'@'%.example.com' REQUIRE SSL;
  ```
