### 29.12.16 Performance Schema Thread Pool Tables

[29.12.16.1 The tp\_thread\_group\_state Table](performance-schema-tp-thread-group-state-table.md)

[29.12.16.2 The tp\_thread\_group\_stats Table](performance-schema-tp-thread-group-stats-table.md)

[29.12.16.3 The tp\_thread\_state Table](performance-schema-tp-thread-state-table.md)

Note

The Performance Schema tables described here are available as
of MySQL 8.0.14. Prior to MySQL 8.0.14, use the corresponding
`INFORMATION_SCHEMA` tables instead; see
[Section 28.5, “INFORMATION\_SCHEMA Thread Pool Tables”](thread-pool-information-schema-tables.md "28.5 INFORMATION_SCHEMA Thread Pool Tables").

The following sections describe the Performance Schema tables
associated with the thread pool plugin (see
[Section 7.6.3, “MySQL Enterprise Thread Pool”](thread-pool.md "7.6.3 MySQL Enterprise Thread Pool")). They provide information about
thread pool operation:

- [`tp_thread_group_state`](performance-schema-tp-thread-group-state-table.md "29.12.16.1 The tp_thread_group_state Table"):
  Information about thread pool thread group states.
- [`tp_thread_group_stats`](performance-schema-tp-thread-group-stats-table.md "29.12.16.2 The tp_thread_group_stats Table"): Thread
  group statistics.
- [`tp_thread_state`](performance-schema-tp-thread-state-table.md "29.12.16.3 The tp_thread_state Table"): Information
  about thread pool thread states.

Rows in these tables represent snapshots in time. In the case of
[`tp_thread_state`](performance-schema-tp-thread-state-table.md "29.12.16.3 The tp_thread_state Table"), all rows for a
thread group comprise a snapshot in time. Thus, the MySQL server
holds the mutex of the thread group while producing the
snapshot. But it does not hold mutexes on all thread groups at
the same time, to prevent a statement against
[`tp_thread_state`](performance-schema-tp-thread-state-table.md "29.12.16.3 The tp_thread_state Table") from blocking the
entire MySQL server.

The Performance Schema thread pool tables are implemented by the
thread pool plugin and are loaded and unloaded when that plugin
is loaded and unloaded (see
[Section 7.6.3.2, “Thread Pool Installation”](thread-pool-installation.md "7.6.3.2 Thread Pool Installation")). No special
configuration step for the tables is needed. However, the tables
depend on the thread pool plugin being enabled. If the thread
pool plugin is loaded but disabled, the tables are not created.
