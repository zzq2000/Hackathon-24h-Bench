#### 15.2.15.4 Subqueries with ALL

Syntax:

```sql
operand comparison_operator ALL (subquery)
```

The word `ALL`, which must follow a comparison
operator, means “return `TRUE` if the
comparison is `TRUE` for `ALL`
of the values in the column that the subquery returns.”
For example:

```sql
SELECT s1 FROM t1 WHERE s1 > ALL (SELECT s1 FROM t2);
```

Suppose that there is a row in table `t1`
containing `(10)`. The expression is
`TRUE` if table `t2` contains
`(-5,0,+5)` because `10` is
greater than all three values in `t2`. The
expression is `FALSE` if table
`t2` contains
`(12,6,NULL,-100)` because there is a single
value `12` in table `t2` that
is greater than `10`. The expression is
*unknown* (that is, `NULL`)
if table `t2` contains
`(0,NULL,1)`.

Finally, the expression is `TRUE` if table
`t2` is empty. So, the following expression is
`TRUE` when table `t2` is
empty:

```sql
SELECT * FROM t1 WHERE 1 > ALL (SELECT s1 FROM t2);
```

But this expression is `NULL` when table
`t2` is empty:

```sql
SELECT * FROM t1 WHERE 1 > (SELECT s1 FROM t2);
```

In addition, the following expression is `NULL`
when table `t2` is empty:

```sql
SELECT * FROM t1 WHERE 1 > ALL (SELECT MAX(s1) FROM t2);
```

In general, *tables containing `NULL`
values* and *empty tables* are
“edge cases.” When writing subqueries, always
consider whether you have taken those two possibilities into
account.

`NOT IN` is an alias for `<>
ALL`. Thus, these two statements are the same:

```sql
SELECT s1 FROM t1 WHERE s1 <> ALL (SELECT s1 FROM t2);
SELECT s1 FROM t1 WHERE s1 NOT IN (SELECT s1 FROM t2);
```

MySQL 8.0.19 supports the [`TABLE`](table.md "15.2.16 TABLE Statement")
statement. As with `IN`,
`ANY`, and `SOME`, you can use
`TABLE` with `ALL` and
`NOT IN` provided that the following two
conditions are met:

- The table in the subquery contains only one column
- The subquery does not depend on a column expression

For example, assuming that table `t2` consists
of a single column, the last two statements shown previously can
be written using `TABLE t2` like this:

```sql
SELECT s1 FROM t1 WHERE s1 <> ALL (TABLE t2);
SELECT s1 FROM t1 WHERE s1 NOT IN (TABLE t2);
```

A query such as `SELECT * FROM t1 WHERE 1 > ALL
(SELECT MAX(s1) FROM t2);` cannot be written using
`TABLE t2` because the subquery depends on a
column expression.
