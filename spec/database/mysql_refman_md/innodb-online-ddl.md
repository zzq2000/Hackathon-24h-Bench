The online DDL feature provides support for instant and in-place
table alterations and concurrent DML. Benefits of this feature
include:

- Improved responsiveness and availability in busy production
  environments, where making a table unavailable for minutes or
  hours is not practical.
- For in-place operations, the ability to adjust the balance
  between performance and concurrency during DDL operations using
  the `LOCK` clause. See
  [The LOCK clause](innodb-online-ddl-performance.md#innodb-online-ddl-locking-options "The LOCK clause").
- Less disk space usage and I/O overhead than the table-copy
  method.

Note

`ALGORITHM=INSTANT` support is available for
`ADD COLUMN` and other operations in MySQL
8.0.12.

Typically, you do not need to do anything special to enable online
DDL. By default, MySQL performs the operation instantly or in place,
as permitted, with as little locking as possible.

You can control aspects of a DDL operation using the
`ALGORITHM` and `LOCK` clauses of
the [`ALTER TABLE`](alter-table.md "15.1.9 ALTER TABLE Statement") statement. These
clauses are placed at the end of the statement, separated from the
table and column specifications by commas. For example:

```sql
ALTER TABLE tbl_name ADD PRIMARY KEY (column), ALGORITHM=INPLACE;
```

The `LOCK` clause may be used for operations that
are performed in place and is useful for fine-tuning the degree of
concurrent access to the table during operations. Only
`LOCK=DEFAULT` is supported for operations that are
performed instantly. The `ALGORITHM` clause is
primarily intended for performance comparisons and as a fallback to
the older table-copying behavior in case you encounter any issues.
For example:

- To avoid accidentally making the table unavailable for reads,
  writes, or both, during an in-place [`ALTER
  TABLE`](alter-table.md "15.1.9 ALTER TABLE Statement") operation, specify a clause on the
  [`ALTER TABLE`](alter-table.md "15.1.9 ALTER TABLE Statement") statement such as
  `LOCK=NONE` (permit reads and writes) or
  `LOCK=SHARED` (permit reads). The operation
  halts immediately if the requested level of concurrency is not
  available.
- To compare performance between algorithms, run a statement with
  `ALGORITHM=INSTANT`,
  `ALGORITHM=INPLACE` and
  `ALGORITHM=COPY`. You can also run a statement
  with the [`old_alter_table`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_old_alter_table)
  configuration option enabled to force the use of
  `ALGORITHM=COPY`.
- To avoid tying up the server with an [`ALTER
  TABLE`](alter-table.md "15.1.9 ALTER TABLE Statement") operation that copies the table, include
  `ALGORITHM=INSTANT` or
  `ALGORITHM=INPLACE`. The statement halts
  immediately if it cannot use the specified algorithm.
