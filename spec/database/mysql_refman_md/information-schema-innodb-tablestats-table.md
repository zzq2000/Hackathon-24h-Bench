### 28.4.26 The INFORMATION\_SCHEMA INNODB\_TABLESTATS View

The [`INNODB_TABLESTATS`](information-schema-innodb-tablestats-table.md "28.4.26 The INFORMATION_SCHEMA INNODB_TABLESTATS View") table provides
a view of low-level status information about
`InnoDB` tables. This data is used by the MySQL
optimizer to calculate which index to use when querying an
`InnoDB` table. This information is derived from
in-memory data structures rather than data stored on disk. There
is no corresponding internal `InnoDB` system
table.

`InnoDB` tables are represented in this view if
they have been opened since the last server restart and have not
aged out of the table cache. Tables for which persistent stats are
available are always represented in this view.

Table statistics are updated only for
[`DELETE`](delete.md "15.2.2 DELETE Statement") or
[`UPDATE`](update.md "15.2.17 UPDATE Statement") operations that modify
indexed columns. Statistics are not updated by operations that
modify only nonindexed columns.

[`ANALYZE TABLE`](analyze-table.md "15.7.3.1 ANALYZE TABLE Statement") clears table
statistics and sets the `STATS_INITIALIZED`
column to `Uninitialized`. Statistics are
collected again the next time the table is accessed.

For related usage information and examples, see
[Section 17.15.3, “InnoDB INFORMATION\_SCHEMA Schema Object Tables”](innodb-information-schema-system-tables.md "17.15.3 InnoDB INFORMATION_SCHEMA Schema Object Tables").

The [`INNODB_TABLESTATS`](information-schema-innodb-tablestats-table.md "28.4.26 The INFORMATION_SCHEMA INNODB_TABLESTATS View") table has these
columns:

- `TABLE_ID`

  An identifier representing the table for which statistics are
  available; the same value as
  `INNODB_TABLES.TABLE_ID`.
- `NAME`

  The name of the table; the same value as
  `INNODB_TABLES.NAME`.
- `STATS_INITIALIZED`

  The value is `Initialized` if the statistics
  are already collected, `Uninitialized` if
  not.
- `NUM_ROWS`

  The current estimated number of rows in the table. Updated
  after each DML operation. The value could be imprecise if
  uncommitted transactions are inserting into or deleting from
  the table.
- `CLUST_INDEX_SIZE`

  The number of pages on disk that store the clustered index,
  which holds the `InnoDB` table data in
  primary key order. This value might be null if no statistics
  are collected yet for the table.
- `OTHER_INDEX_SIZE`

  The number of pages on disk that store all secondary indexes
  for the table. This value might be null if no statistics are
  collected yet for the table.
- `MODIFIED_COUNTER`

  The number of rows modified by DML operations, such as
  `INSERT`, `UPDATE`,
  `DELETE`, and also cascade operations from
  foreign keys. This column is reset each time table statistics
  are recalculated
- `AUTOINC`

  The next number to be issued for any auto-increment-based
  operation. The rate at which the `AUTOINC`
  value changes depends on how many times auto-increment numbers
  have been requested and how many numbers are granted per
  request.
- `REF_COUNT`

  When this counter reaches zero, the table metadata can be
  evicted from the table cache.

#### Example

```sql
mysql> SELECT * FROM INFORMATION_SCHEMA.INNODB_TABLESTATS where TABLE_ID = 71\G
*************************** 1. row ***************************
         TABLE_ID: 71
             NAME: test/t1
STATS_INITIALIZED: Initialized
         NUM_ROWS: 1
 CLUST_INDEX_SIZE: 1
 OTHER_INDEX_SIZE: 0
 MODIFIED_COUNTER: 1
          AUTOINC: 0
        REF_COUNT: 1
```

#### Notes

- This table is useful primarily for expert-level performance
  monitoring, or when developing performance-related extensions
  for MySQL.
- You must have the [`PROCESS`](privileges-provided.md#priv_process)
  privilege to query this table.
- Use the `INFORMATION_SCHEMA`
  [`COLUMNS`](information-schema-columns-table.md "28.3.8 The INFORMATION_SCHEMA COLUMNS Table") table or the
  [`SHOW COLUMNS`](show-columns.md "15.7.7.5 SHOW COLUMNS Statement") statement to view
  additional information about the columns of this table,
  including data types and default values.
