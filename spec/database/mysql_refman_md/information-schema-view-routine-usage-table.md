### 28.3.49 The INFORMATION\_SCHEMA VIEW\_ROUTINE\_USAGE Table

The [`VIEW_ROUTINE_USAGE`](information-schema-view-routine-usage-table.md "28.3.49 The INFORMATION_SCHEMA VIEW_ROUTINE_USAGE Table") table
(available as of MySQL 8.0.13) provides access to information
about stored functions used in view definitions. The table does
not list information about built-in (native) functions or loadable
functions used in the definitions.

You can see information only for views for which you have some
privilege, and only for functions for which you have some
privilege.

The [`VIEW_ROUTINE_USAGE`](information-schema-view-routine-usage-table.md "28.3.49 The INFORMATION_SCHEMA VIEW_ROUTINE_USAGE Table") table has
these columns:

- `TABLE_CATALOG`

  The name of the catalog to which the view belongs. This value
  is always `def`.
- `TABLE_SCHEMA`

  The name of the schema (database) to which the view belongs.
- `TABLE_NAME`

  The name of the view.
- `SPECIFIC_CATALOG`

  The name of the catalog to which the function used in the view
  definition belongs. This value is always
  `def`.
- `SPECIFIC_SCHEMA`

  The name of the schema (database) to which the function used
  in the view definition belongs.
- `SPECIFIC_NAME`

  The name of the function used in the view definition.
