#### 29.12.12.2 The ndb\_sync\_excluded\_objects Table

This table provides information about
[`NDB`](mysql-cluster.md "Chapter 25 MySQL NDB Cluster 8.0") database objects which cannot
be automatically synchronized between NDB Cluster's
dictionary and the MySQL data dictionary.

Example information about [`NDB`](mysql-cluster.md "Chapter 25 MySQL NDB Cluster 8.0")
database objects which cannot be synchronized with the MySQL
data dictionary:

```sql
mysql> SELECT * FROM performance_schema.ndb_sync_excluded_objects\G
*************************** 1. row ***************************
SCHEMA_NAME: NULL
       NAME: lg1
       TYPE: LOGFILE GROUP
     REASON: Injected failure
*************************** 2. row ***************************
SCHEMA_NAME: NULL
       NAME: ts1
       TYPE: TABLESPACE
     REASON: Injected failure
*************************** 3. row ***************************
SCHEMA_NAME: db1
       NAME: NULL
       TYPE: SCHEMA
     REASON: Injected failure
*************************** 4. row ***************************
SCHEMA_NAME: test
       NAME: t1
       TYPE: TABLE
     REASON: Injected failure
*************************** 5. row ***************************
SCHEMA_NAME: test
       NAME: t2
       TYPE: TABLE
     REASON: Injected failure
*************************** 6. row ***************************
SCHEMA_NAME: test
       NAME: t3
       TYPE: TABLE
     REASON: Injected failure
```

The [`ndb_sync_excluded_objects`](performance-schema-ndb-sync-excluded-objects-table.md "29.12.12.2 The ndb_sync_excluded_objects Table")
table has these columns:

- `SCHEMA_NAME`: The name of the schema
  (database) in which the object which has failed to
  synchronize resides; this is `NULL` for
  tablespaces and log file groups
- `NAME`: The name of the object which has
  failed to synchronize; this is `NULL` if
  the object is a schema
- `TYPE`: The type of the object has failed
  to synchronize; this is one of `LOGFILE
  GROUP`, `TABLESPACE`,
  `SCHEMA`, or `TABLE`
- `REASON`: The reason for exclusion
  (blocklisting) of the object; that is, the reason for the
  failure to synchronize this object

  Possible reasons include the following:

  - `Injected failure`
  - `Failed to determine if object existed in
    NDB`
  - `Failed to determine if object existed in
    DD`
  - `Failed to drop object in DD`
  - `Failed to get undofiles assigned to logfile
    group`
  - `Failed to get object id and version`
  - `Failed to install object in DD`
  - `Failed to get datafiles assigned to
    tablespace`
  - `Failed to create schema`
  - `Failed to determine if object was a local
    table`
  - `Failed to invalidate table
    references`
  - `Failed to set database name of NDB
    object`
  - `Failed to get extra metadata of
    table`
  - `Failed to migrate table with extra metadata
    version 1`
  - `Failed to get object from DD`
  - `Definition of table has changed in NDB
    Dictionary`
  - `Failed to setup binlogging for
    table`

  This list is not necessarily exhaustive, and is subject to
  change in future [`NDB`](mysql-cluster.md "Chapter 25 MySQL NDB Cluster 8.0")
  releases.

The [`ndb_sync_excluded_objects`](performance-schema-ndb-sync-excluded-objects-table.md "29.12.12.2 The ndb_sync_excluded_objects Table")
table was added in NDB 8.0.21.
