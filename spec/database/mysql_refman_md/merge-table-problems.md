### 18.7.2 MERGE Table Problems

The following are known problems with `MERGE`
tables:

- `MERGE` child tables are locked through the
  parent table. If the parent is a temporary table, it is not
  locked, and thus the child tables are also not locked; this
  means that parallel use of the underlying
  [`MyISAM`](myisam-storage-engine.md "18.2 The MyISAM Storage Engine") tables corrupts them.
- If you use [`ALTER TABLE`](alter-table.md "15.1.9 ALTER TABLE Statement") to
  change a `MERGE` table to another storage
  engine, the mapping to the underlying tables is lost. Instead,
  the rows from the underlying `MyISAM` tables
  are copied into the altered table, which then uses the
  specified storage engine.
- The `INSERT_METHOD` table option for a
  `MERGE` table indicates which underlying
  `MyISAM` table to use for inserts into the
  `MERGE` table. However, use of the
  `AUTO_INCREMENT` table option for that
  `MyISAM` table has no effect for inserts into
  the `MERGE` table until at least one row has
  been inserted directly into the `MyISAM`
  table.
- A `MERGE` table cannot maintain uniqueness
  constraints over the entire table. When you perform an
  [`INSERT`](insert.md "15.2.7 INSERT Statement"), the data goes into the
  first or last `MyISAM` table (as determined
  by the `INSERT_METHOD` option). MySQL ensures
  that unique key values remain unique within that
  `MyISAM` table, but not over all the
  underlying tables in the collection.
- Because the `MERGE` engine cannot enforce
  uniqueness over the set of underlying tables,
  [`REPLACE`](replace.md "15.2.12 REPLACE Statement") does not work as
  expected. The two key facts are:

  - [`REPLACE`](replace.md "15.2.12 REPLACE Statement") can detect unique
    key violations only in the underlying table to which it is
    going to write (which is determined by the
    `INSERT_METHOD` option). This differs
    from violations in the `MERGE` table
    itself.
  - If [`REPLACE`](replace.md "15.2.12 REPLACE Statement") detects a unique
    key violation, it changes only the corresponding row in
    the underlying table it is writing to; that is, the first
    or last table, as determined by the
    `INSERT_METHOD` option.

  Similar considerations apply for
  [`INSERT
  ... ON DUPLICATE KEY UPDATE`](insert-on-duplicate.md "15.2.7.2 INSERT ... ON DUPLICATE KEY UPDATE Statement").
- `MERGE` tables do not support partitioning.
  That is, you cannot partition a `MERGE`
  table, nor can any of a `MERGE` table's
  underlying `MyISAM` tables be partitioned.
- You should not use [`ANALYZE
  TABLE`](analyze-table.md "15.7.3.1 ANALYZE TABLE Statement"), [`REPAIR TABLE`](repair-table.md "15.7.3.5 REPAIR TABLE Statement"),
  [`OPTIMIZE TABLE`](optimize-table.md "15.7.3.4 OPTIMIZE TABLE Statement"),
  [`ALTER TABLE`](alter-table.md "15.1.9 ALTER TABLE Statement"),
  [`DROP TABLE`](drop-table.md "15.1.32 DROP TABLE Statement"),
  [`DELETE`](delete.md "15.2.2 DELETE Statement") without a
  `WHERE` clause, or
  [`TRUNCATE TABLE`](truncate-table.md "15.1.37 TRUNCATE TABLE Statement") on any of the
  tables that are mapped into an open `MERGE`
  table. If you do so, the `MERGE` table may
  still refer to the original table and yield unexpected
  results. To work around this problem, ensure that no
  `MERGE` tables remain open by issuing a
  [`FLUSH TABLES`](flush.md#flush-tables) statement prior to
  performing any of the named operations.

  The unexpected results include the possibility that the
  operation on the `MERGE` table reports table
  corruption. If this occurs after one of the named operations
  on the underlying `MyISAM` tables, the
  corruption message is spurious. To deal with this, issue a
  [`FLUSH TABLES`](flush.md#flush-tables) statement after
  modifying the `MyISAM` tables.
- [`DROP TABLE`](drop-table.md "15.1.32 DROP TABLE Statement") on a table that is
  in use by a `MERGE` table does not work on
  Windows because the `MERGE` storage engine's
  table mapping is hidden from the upper layer of MySQL. Windows
  does not permit open files to be deleted, so you first must
  flush all `MERGE` tables (with
  [`FLUSH TABLES`](flush.md#flush-tables)) or drop the
  `MERGE` table before dropping the table.
- The definition of the `MyISAM` tables and the
  `MERGE` table are checked when the tables are
  accessed (for example, as part of a
  [`SELECT`](select.md "15.2.13 SELECT Statement") or
  [`INSERT`](insert.md "15.2.7 INSERT Statement") statement). The checks
  ensure that the definitions of the tables and the parent
  `MERGE` table definition match by comparing
  column order, types, sizes and associated indexes. If there is
  a difference between the tables, an error is returned and the
  statement fails. Because these checks take place when the
  tables are opened, any changes to the definition of a single
  table, including column changes, column ordering, and engine
  alterations cause the statement to fail.
- The order of indexes in the `MERGE` table and
  its underlying tables should be the same. If you use
  [`ALTER TABLE`](alter-table.md "15.1.9 ALTER TABLE Statement") to add a
  `UNIQUE` index to a table used in a
  `MERGE` table, and then use
  [`ALTER TABLE`](alter-table.md "15.1.9 ALTER TABLE Statement") to add a nonunique
  index on the `MERGE` table, the index
  ordering is different for the tables if there was already a
  nonunique index in the underlying table. (This happens because
  [`ALTER TABLE`](alter-table.md "15.1.9 ALTER TABLE Statement") puts
  `UNIQUE` indexes before nonunique indexes to
  facilitate rapid detection of duplicate keys.) Consequently,
  queries on tables with such indexes may return unexpected
  results.
- If you encounter an error message similar to ERROR
  1017 (HY000): Can't find file:
  '*`tbl_name`*.MRG' (errno:
  2), it generally indicates that some of the
  underlying tables do not use the `MyISAM`
  storage engine. Confirm that all of these tables are
  `MyISAM`.
- The maximum number of rows in a `MERGE` table
  is 264 (~1.844E+19; the same as for
  a `MyISAM` table). It is not possible to
  merge multiple `MyISAM` tables into a single
  `MERGE` table that would have more than this
  number of rows.
- Use of underlying `MyISAM` tables of
  differing row formats with a parent `MERGE`
  table is currently known to fail. See Bug #32364.
- You cannot change the union list of a nontemporary
  `MERGE` table when [`LOCK
  TABLES`](lock-tables.md "15.3.6 LOCK TABLES and UNLOCK TABLES Statements") is in effect. The following does
  *not* work:

  ```sql
  CREATE TABLE m1 ... ENGINE=MRG_MYISAM ...;
  LOCK TABLES t1 WRITE, t2 WRITE, m1 WRITE;
  ALTER TABLE m1 ... UNION=(t1,t2) ...;
  ```

  However, you can do this with a temporary
  `MERGE` table.
- You cannot create a `MERGE` table with
  `CREATE ... SELECT`, neither as a temporary
  `MERGE` table, nor as a nontemporary
  `MERGE` table. For example:

  ```sql
  CREATE TABLE m1 ... ENGINE=MRG_MYISAM ... SELECT ...;
  ```

  Attempts to do this result in an error:
  *`tbl_name`* is not `BASE
  TABLE`.
- In some cases, differing `PACK_KEYS` table
  option values among the `MERGE` and
  underlying tables cause unexpected results if the underlying
  tables contain `CHAR` or
  `BINARY` columns. As a workaround, use
  `ALTER TABLE` to ensure that all involved
  tables have the same `PACK_KEYS` value. (Bug
  #50646)
