### 8.2.3 Grant Tables

The `mysql` system database includes several
grant tables that contain information about user accounts and the
privileges held by them. This section describes those tables. For
information about other tables in the system database, see
[Section 7.3, “The mysql System Schema”](system-schema.md "7.3 The mysql System Schema").

The discussion here describes the underlying structure of the
grant tables and how the server uses their contents when
interacting with clients. However, normally you do not modify the
grant tables directly. Modifications occur indirectly when you use
account-management statements such as [`CREATE
USER`](create-user.md "15.7.1.3 CREATE USER Statement"), [`GRANT`](grant.md "15.7.1.6 GRANT Statement"), and
[`REVOKE`](revoke.md "15.7.1.8 REVOKE Statement") to set up accounts and
control the privileges available to each one. See
[Section 15.7.1, “Account Management Statements”](account-management-statements.md "15.7.1 Account Management Statements"). When you use such
statements to perform account manipulations, the server modifies
the grant tables on your behalf.

Note

Direct modification of grant tables using statements such as
[`INSERT`](insert.md "15.2.7 INSERT Statement"),
[`UPDATE`](update.md "15.2.17 UPDATE Statement"), or
[`DELETE`](delete.md "15.2.2 DELETE Statement") is discouraged and done at
your own risk. The server is free to ignore rows that become
malformed as a result of such modifications.

For any operation that modifies a grant table, the server checks
whether the table has the expected structure and produces an
error if not. To update the tables to the expected structure,
perform the MySQL upgrade procedure. See
[Chapter 3, *Upgrading MySQL*](upgrading.md "Chapter 3 Upgrading MySQL").

#### Grant Table Overview

These `mysql` database tables contain grant
information:

- [`user`](grant-tables.md#grant-tables-user-db "The user and db Grant Tables"):
  User accounts, static global privileges, and other
  nonprivilege columns.
- [`global_grants`](grant-tables.md#grant-tables-global-grants "The global_grants Grant Table"):
  Dynamic global privileges.
- [`db`](grant-tables.md#grant-tables-user-db "The user and db Grant Tables"):
  Database-level privileges.
- [`tables_priv`](grant-tables.md#grant-tables-tables-priv-columns-priv "The tables_priv and columns_priv Grant Tables"):
  Table-level privileges.
- [`columns_priv`](grant-tables.md#grant-tables-tables-priv-columns-priv "The tables_priv and columns_priv Grant Tables"):
  Column-level privileges.
- [`procs_priv`](grant-tables.md#grant-tables-procs-priv "The procs_priv Grant Table"):
  Stored procedure and function privileges.
- [`proxies_priv`](grant-tables.md#grant-tables-proxies-priv "The proxies_priv Grant Table"):
  Proxy-user privileges.
- [`default_roles`](grant-tables.md#grant-tables-default-roles "The default_roles Grant Table"):
  Default user roles.
- [`role_edges`](grant-tables.md#grant-tables-role-edges "The role_edges Grant Table"):
  Edges for role subgraphs.
- [`password_history`](grant-tables.md#grant-tables-password-history "The password_history Grant Table"):
  Password change history.

For information about the differences between static and dynamic
global privileges, see
[Static Versus Dynamic Privileges](privileges-provided.md#static-dynamic-privileges "Static Versus Dynamic Privileges").)

In MySQL 8.0, grant tables use the
`InnoDB` storage engine and are transactional.
Before MySQL 8.0, grant tables used the
`MyISAM` storage engine and were
nontransactional. This change of grant table storage engine
enables an accompanying change to the behavior of
account-management statements such as
[`CREATE USER`](create-user.md "15.7.1.3 CREATE USER Statement") or
[`GRANT`](grant.md "15.7.1.6 GRANT Statement"). Previously, an
account-management statement that named multiple users could
succeed for some users and fail for others. Now, each statement
is transactional and either succeeds for all named users or
rolls back and has no effect if any error occurs.

Each grant table contains scope columns and privilege columns:

- Scope columns determine the scope of each row in the tables;
  that is, the context in which the row applies. For example,
  a `user` table row with
  `Host` and `User` values
  of `'h1.example.net'` and
  `'bob'` applies to authenticating
  connections made to the server from the host
  `h1.example.net` by a client that specifies
  a user name of `bob`. Similarly, a
  `db` table row with
  `Host`, `User`, and
  `Db` column values of
  `'h1.example.net'`,
  `'bob'` and `'reports'`
  applies when `bob` connects from the host
  `h1.example.net` to access the
  `reports` database. The
  `tables_priv` and
  `columns_priv` tables contain scope columns
  indicating tables or table/column combinations to which each
  row applies. The `procs_priv` scope columns
  indicate the stored routine to which each row applies.
- Privilege columns indicate which privileges a table row
  grants; that is, which operations it permits to be
  performed. The server combines the information in the
  various grant tables to form a complete description of a
  user's privileges. [Section 8.2.7, “Access Control, Stage 2: Request Verification”](request-access.md "8.2.7 Access Control, Stage 2: Request Verification"),
  describes the rules for this.

In addition, a grant table may contain columns used for purposes
other than scope or privilege assessment.

The server uses the grant tables in the following manner:

- The `user` table scope columns determine
  whether to reject or permit incoming connections. For
  permitted connections, any privileges granted in the
  `user` table indicate the user's static
  global privileges. Any privileges granted in this table
  apply to *all* databases on the server.

  Caution

  Because any static global privilege is considered a
  privilege for all databases, any static global privilege
  enables a user to see all database names with
  [`SHOW DATABASES`](show-databases.md "15.7.7.14 SHOW DATABASES Statement") or by
  examining the [`SCHEMATA`](information-schema-schemata-table.md "28.3.31 The INFORMATION_SCHEMA SCHEMATA Table") table
  of `INFORMATION_SCHEMA`, except databases
  that have been restricted at the database level by partial
  revokes.
- The `global_grants` table lists current
  assignments of dynamic global privileges to user accounts.
  For each row, the scope columns determine which user has the
  privilege named in the privilege column.
- The `db` table scope columns determine
  which users can access which databases from which hosts. The
  privilege columns determine the permitted operations. A
  privilege granted at the database level applies to the
  database and to all objects in the database, such as tables
  and stored programs.
- The `tables_priv` and
  `columns_priv` tables are similar to the
  `db` table, but are more fine-grained: They
  apply at the table and column levels rather than at the
  database level. A privilege granted at the table level
  applies to the table and to all its columns. A privilege
  granted at the column level applies only to a specific
  column.
- The `procs_priv` table applies to stored
  routines (stored procedures and functions). A privilege
  granted at the routine level applies only to a single
  procedure or function.
- The `proxies_priv` table indicates which
  users can act as proxies for other users and whether a user
  can grant the [`PROXY`](privileges-provided.md#priv_proxy) privilege
  to other users.
- The `default_roles` and
  `role_edges` tables contain information
  about role relationships.
- The `password_history` table retains
  previously chosen passwords to enable restrictions on
  password reuse. See [Section 8.2.15, “Password Management”](password-management.md "8.2.15 Password Management").

The server reads the contents of the grant tables into memory
when it starts. You can tell it to reload the tables by issuing
a [`FLUSH PRIVILEGES`](flush.md#flush-privileges) statement or
executing a [**mysqladmin flush-privileges**](mysqladmin.md "6.5.2 mysqladmin — A MySQL Server Administration Program") or
[**mysqladmin reload**](mysqladmin.md "6.5.2 mysqladmin — A MySQL Server Administration Program") command. Changes to the
grant tables take effect as indicated in
[Section 8.2.13, “When Privilege Changes Take Effect”](privilege-changes.md "8.2.13 When Privilege Changes Take Effect").

When you modify an account, it is a good idea to verify that
your changes have the intended effect. To check the privileges
for a given account, use the [`SHOW
GRANTS`](show-grants.md "15.7.7.21 SHOW GRANTS Statement") statement. For example, to determine the
privileges that are granted to an account with user name and
host name values of `bob` and
`pc84.example.com`, use this statement:

```sql
SHOW GRANTS FOR 'bob'@'pc84.example.com';
```

To display nonprivilege properties of an account, use
[`SHOW CREATE USER`](show-create-user.md "15.7.7.12 SHOW CREATE USER Statement"):

```sql
SHOW CREATE USER 'bob'@'pc84.example.com';
```

#### The user and db Grant Tables

The server uses the `user` and
`db` tables in the `mysql`
database at both the first and second stages of access control
(see [Section 8.2, “Access Control and Account Management”](access-control.md "8.2 Access Control and Account Management")). The columns in the
`user` and `db` tables are
shown here.

**Table 8.4 user and db Table Columns**

| Table Name | `user` | `db` |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Scope columns** | `Host` | `Host` |
|  | `User` | `Db` |
|  |  | `User` |
| **Privilege columns** | `Select_priv` | `Select_priv` |
|  | `Insert_priv` | `Insert_priv` |
|  | `Update_priv` | `Update_priv` |
|  | `Delete_priv` | `Delete_priv` |
|  | `Index_priv` | `Index_priv` |
|  | `Alter_priv` | `Alter_priv` |
|  | `Create_priv` | `Create_priv` |
|  | `Drop_priv` | `Drop_priv` |
|  | `Grant_priv` | `Grant_priv` |

|  | `Trigger_priv` | `Trigger_priv` |
|  | `Event_priv` | `Event_priv` |
|  | `Create_tmp_table_priv` | `Create_tmp_table_priv` |
|  | `Lock_tables_priv` | `Lock_tables_priv` |
|  | `References_priv` | `References_priv` |
|  | `Reload_priv` |  |
|  | `Shutdown_priv` |  |
|  | `Process_priv` |  |
|  | `File_priv` |  |
|  | `Show_db_priv` |  |
|  | `Super_priv` |  |
|  | `Repl_slave_priv` |  |
|  | `Repl_client_priv` |  |
|  | `Create_user_priv` |  |
|  | `Create_tablespace_priv` |  |
|  | `Create_role_priv` |  |
|  | `Drop_role_priv` |  |
| **Security columns** | `ssl_type` |  |
|  | `ssl_cipher` |  |
|  | `x509_issuer` |  |
|  | `x509_subject` |  |
|  | `plugin` |  |
|  | `authentication_string` |  |
|  | `password_expired` |  |
|  | `password_last_changed` |  |
|  | `password_lifetime` |  |
|  | `account_locked` |  |
|  | `Password_reuse_history` |  |
|  | `Password_reuse_time` |  |
|  | `Password_require_current` |  |
|  | `User_attributes` |  |
| **Resource control columns** | `max_questions` |  |
|  | `max_updates` |  |
|  | `max_connections` |  |
|  | `max_user_connections` |  |

The `user` table `plugin` and
`authentication_string` columns store
authentication plugin and credential information.

The server uses the plugin named in the
`plugin` column of an account row to
authenticate connection attempts for the account.

The `plugin` column must be nonempty. At
startup, and at runtime when [`FLUSH
PRIVILEGES`](flush.md#flush-privileges) is executed, the server checks
`user` table rows. For any row with an empty
`plugin` column, the server writes a warning to
the error log of this form:

```none
[Warning] User entry 'user_name'@'host_name' has an empty plugin
value. The user will be ignored and no one can login with this user
anymore.
```

To assign a plugin to an account that is missing one, use the
[`ALTER USER`](alter-user.md "15.7.1.1 ALTER USER Statement") statement.

The `password_expired` column permits DBAs to
expire account passwords and require users to reset their
password. The default `password_expired` value
is `'N'`, but can be set to
`'Y'` with the [`ALTER
USER`](alter-user.md "15.7.1.1 ALTER USER Statement") statement. After an account's password has been
expired, all operations performed by the account in subsequent
connections to the server result in an error until the user
issues an [`ALTER USER`](alter-user.md "15.7.1.1 ALTER USER Statement") statement to
establish a new account password.

Note

Although it is possible to “reset” an expired
password by setting it to its current value, it is preferable,
as a matter of good policy, to choose a different password.
DBAs can enforce non-reuse by establishing an appropriate
password-reuse policy. See
[Password Reuse Policy](password-management.md#password-reuse-policy "Password Reuse Policy").

`password_last_changed` is a
`TIMESTAMP` column indicating when the password
was last changed. The value is non-`NULL` only
for accounts that use a MySQL built-in authentication plugin
(`mysql_native_password`,
`sha256_password`, or
`caching_sha2_password`). The value is
`NULL` for other accounts, such as those
authenticated using an external authentication system.

`password_last_changed` is updated by the
[`CREATE USER`](create-user.md "15.7.1.3 CREATE USER Statement"),
[`ALTER USER`](alter-user.md "15.7.1.1 ALTER USER Statement"), and
[`SET PASSWORD`](set-password.md "15.7.1.10 SET PASSWORD Statement") statements, and by
[`GRANT`](grant.md "15.7.1.6 GRANT Statement") statements that create an
account or change an account password.

`password_lifetime` indicates the account
password lifetime, in days. If the password is past its lifetime
(assessed using the `password_last_changed`
column), the server considers the password expired when clients
connect using the account. A value of
*`N`* greater than zero means that the
password must be changed every *`N`*
days. A value of 0 disables automatic password expiration. If
the value is `NULL` (the default), the global
expiration policy applies, as defined by the
[`default_password_lifetime`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_default_password_lifetime)
system variable.

`account_locked` indicates whether the account
is locked (see [Section 8.2.20, “Account Locking”](account-locking.md "8.2.20 Account Locking")).

`Password_reuse_history` is the value of the
`PASSWORD HISTORY` option for the account, or
`NULL` for the default history.

`Password_reuse_time` is the value of the
`PASSWORD REUSE INTERVAL` option for the
account, or `NULL` for the default interval.

`Password_require_current` (added in MySQL
8.0.13) corresponds to the value of the `PASSWORD
REQUIRE` option for the account, as shown by the
following table.

**Table 8.5 Permitted Password\_require\_current Values**

| Password\_require\_current Value | Corresponding PASSWORD REQUIRE Option |
| --- | --- |
| `'Y'` | `PASSWORD REQUIRE CURRENT` |
| `'N'` | `PASSWORD REQUIRE CURRENT OPTIONAL` |
| `NULL` | `PASSWORD REQUIRE CURRENT DEFAULT` |

`User_attributes` (added in MySQL 8.0.14) is a
JSON-format column that stores account attributes not stored in
other columns. As of MySQL 8.0.21, the
`INFORMATION_SCHEMA` exposes these attributes
through the [`USER_ATTRIBUTES`](information-schema-user-attributes-table.md "28.3.46 The INFORMATION_SCHEMA USER_ATTRIBUTES Table") table.

The `User_attributes` column may contain these
attributes:

- `additional_password`: The secondary
  password, if any. See [Dual Password Support](password-management.md#dual-passwords "Dual Password Support").
- `Restrictions`: Restriction lists, if any.
  Restrictions are added by partial-revoke operations. The
  attribute value is an array of elements that each have
  `Database` and
  `Restrictions` keys indicating the name of
  a restricted database and the applicable restrictions on it
  (see [Section 8.2.12, “Privilege Restriction Using Partial Revokes”](partial-revokes.md "8.2.12 Privilege Restriction Using Partial Revokes")).
- `Password_locking`: The conditions for
  failed-login tracking and temporary account locking, if any
  (see [Failed-Login Tracking and Temporary Account Locking](password-management.md#failed-login-tracking "Failed-Login Tracking and Temporary Account Locking")). The
  `Password_locking` attribute is updated
  according to the `FAILED_LOGIN_ATTEMPTS`
  and `PASSWORD_LOCK_TIME` options of the
  [`CREATE USER`](create-user.md "15.7.1.3 CREATE USER Statement") and
  [`ALTER USER`](alter-user.md "15.7.1.1 ALTER USER Statement") statements. The
  attribute value is a hash with
  `failed_login_attempts` and
  `password_lock_time_days` keys indicating
  the value of such options as have been specified for the
  account. If a key is missing, its value is implicitly 0. If
  a key value is implicitly or explicitly 0, the corresponding
  capability is disabled. This attribute was added in MySQL
  8.0.19.
- `multi_factor_authentication`: Rows in the
  `mysql.user` system table have a
  `plugin` column that indicates an
  authentication plugin. For single-factor authentication,
  that plugin is the only authentication factor. For
  two-factor or three-factor forms of multifactor
  authentication, that plugin corresponds to the first
  authentication factor, but additional information must be
  stored for the second and third factors. The
  `multi_factor_authentication` attribute
  holds this information. This attribute was added in MySQL
  8.0.27.

  The `multi_factor_authentication` value is
  an array, where each array element is a hash that describes
  an authentication factor using these attributes:

  - `plugin`: The name of the
    authentication plugin.
  - `authentication_string`: The
    authentication string value.
  - `passwordless`: A flag that denotes
    whether the user is meant to be used without a password
    (with a security token as the only authentication
    method).
  - `requires_registration`: a flag that
    defines whether the user account has registered a
    security token.

  The first and second array elements describe multifactor
  authentication factors 2 and 3.

If no attributes apply, `User_attributes` is
`NULL`.

Example: An account that has a secondary password and partially
revoked database privileges has
`additional_password` and
`Restrictions` attributes in the column value:

```sql
mysql> SELECT User_attributes FROM mysql.User WHERE User = 'u'\G
*************************** 1. row ***************************
User_attributes: {"Restrictions":
                   [{"Database": "mysql", "Privileges": ["SELECT"]}],
                  "additional_password": "hashed_credentials"}
```

To determine which attributes are present, use the
[`JSON_KEYS()`](json-search-functions.md#function_json-keys) function:

```sql
SELECT User, Host, JSON_KEYS(User_attributes)
FROM mysql.user WHERE User_attributes IS NOT NULL;
```

To extract a particular attribute, such as
`Restrictions`, do this:

```sql
SELECT User, Host, User_attributes->>'$.Restrictions'
FROM mysql.user WHERE User_attributes->>'$.Restrictions' <> '';
```

Here is an example of the kind of information stored for
`multi_factor_authentication`:

```json
{
  "multi_factor_authentication": [
    {
      "plugin": "authentication_ldap_simple",
      "passwordless": 0,
      "authentication_string": "ldap auth string",
      "requires_registration": 0
    },
    {
      "plugin": "authentication_fido",
      "passwordless": 0,
      "authentication_string": "",
      "requires_registration": 1
    }
  ]
}
```

#### The tables\_priv and columns\_priv Grant Tables

During the second stage of access control, the server performs
request verification to ensure that each client has sufficient
privileges for each request that it issues. In addition to the
`user` and `db` grant tables,
the server may also consult the `tables_priv`
and `columns_priv` tables for requests that
involve tables. The latter tables provide finer privilege
control at the table and column levels. They have the columns
shown in the following table.

**Table 8.6 tables\_priv and columns\_priv Table Columns**

| Table Name | `tables_priv` | `columns_priv` |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Scope columns** | `Host` | `Host` |
|  | `Db` | `Db` |
|  | `User` | `User` |
|  | `Table_name` | `Table_name` |
|  |  | `Column_name` |
| **Privilege columns** | `Table_priv` | `Column_priv` |
|  | `Column_priv` |  |
| **Other columns** | `Timestamp` | `Timestamp` |
|  | `Grantor` |  |

The `Timestamp` and `Grantor`
columns are set to the current timestamp and the
[`CURRENT_USER`](information-functions.md#function_current-user) value, respectively,
but are otherwise unused.

#### The procs\_priv Grant Table

For verification of requests that involve stored routines, the
server may consult the `procs_priv` table,
which has the columns shown in the following table.

**Table 8.7 procs\_priv Table Columns**

| Table Name | `procs_priv` |
| --- | --- |
| **Scope columns** | `Host` |
|  | `Db` |
|  | `User` |
|  | `Routine_name` |
|  | `Routine_type` |
| **Privilege columns** | `Proc_priv` |
| **Other columns** | `Timestamp` |
|  | `Grantor` |

The `Routine_type` column is an
[`ENUM`](enum.md "13.3.5 The ENUM Type") column with values of
`'FUNCTION'` or `'PROCEDURE'`
to indicate the type of routine the row refers to. This column
enables privileges to be granted separately for a function and a
procedure with the same name.

The `Timestamp` and `Grantor`
columns are unused.

#### The proxies\_priv Grant Table

The `proxies_priv` table records information
about proxy accounts. It has these columns:

- `Host`, `User`: The proxy
  account; that is, the account that has the
  [`PROXY`](privileges-provided.md#priv_proxy) privilege for the
  proxied account.
- `Proxied_host`,
  `Proxied_user`: The proxied account.
- `Grantor`, `Timestamp`:
  Unused.
- `With_grant`: Whether the proxy account can
  grant the [`PROXY`](privileges-provided.md#priv_proxy) privilege to
  other accounts.

For an account to be able to grant the
[`PROXY`](privileges-provided.md#priv_proxy) privilege to other
accounts, it must have a row in the
`proxies_priv` table with
`With_grant` set to 1 and
`Proxied_host` and
`Proxied_user` set to indicate the account or
accounts for which the privilege can be granted. For example,
the `'root'@'localhost'` account created during
MySQL installation has a row in the
`proxies_priv` table that enables granting the
[`PROXY`](privileges-provided.md#priv_proxy) privilege for
`''@''`, that is, for all users and all hosts.
This enables `root` to set up proxy users, as
well as to delegate to other accounts the authority to set up
proxy users. See [Section 8.2.19, “Proxy Users”](proxy-users.md "8.2.19 Proxy Users").

#### The global\_grants Grant Table

The `global_grants` table lists current
assignments of dynamic global privileges to user accounts. The
table has these columns:

- `USER`, `HOST`: The user
  name and host name of the account to which the privilege is
  granted.
- `PRIV`: The privilege name.
- `WITH_GRANT_OPTION`: Whether the account
  can grant the privilege to other accounts.

#### The default\_roles Grant Table

The `default_roles` table lists default user
roles. It has these columns:

- `HOST`, `USER`: The
  account or role to which the default role applies.
- `DEFAULT_ROLE_HOST`,
  `DEFAULT_ROLE_USER`: The default role.

#### The role\_edges Grant Table

The `role_edges` table lists edges for role
subgraphs. It has these columns:

- `FROM_HOST`, `FROM_USER`:
  The account that is granted a role.
- `TO_HOST`, `TO_USER`: The
  role that is granted to the account.
- `WITH_ADMIN_OPTION`: Whether the account
  can grant the role to and revoke it from other accounts by
  using `WITH ADMIN OPTION`.

#### The password\_history Grant Table

The `password_history` table contains
information about password changes. It has these columns:

- `Host`, `User`: The
  account for which the password change occurred.
- `Password_timestamp`: The time when the
  password change occurred.
- `Password`: The new password hash value.

The `password_history` table accumulates a
sufficient number of nonempty passwords per account to enable
MySQL to perform checks against both the account password
history length and reuse interval. Automatic pruning of entries
that are outside both limits occurs when password-change
attempts occur.

Note

The empty password does not count in the password history and
is subject to reuse at any time.

If an account is renamed, its entries are renamed to match. If
an account is dropped or its authentication plugin is changed,
its entries are removed.

#### Grant Table Scope Column Properties

Scope columns in the grant tables contain strings. The default
value for each is the empty string. The following table shows
the number of characters permitted in each column.

**Table 8.8 Grant Table Scope Column Lengths**

| Column Name | Maximum Permitted Characters |
| --- | --- |
| `Host`, `Proxied_host` | 255 (60 prior to MySQL 8.0.17) |
| `User`, `Proxied_user` | 32 |
| `Db` | 64 |
| `Table_name` | 64 |
| `Column_name` | 64 |
| `Routine_name` | 64 |

`Host` and `Proxied_host`
values are converted to lowercase before being stored in the
grant tables.

For access-checking purposes, comparisons of
`User`, `Proxied_user`,
`authentication_string`, `Db`,
and `Table_name` values are case-sensitive.
Comparisons of `Host`,
`Proxied_host`, `Column_name`,
and `Routine_name` values are not
case-sensitive.

#### Grant Table Privilege Column Properties

The `user` and `db` tables
list each privilege in a separate column that is declared as
`ENUM('N','Y') DEFAULT 'N'`. In other words,
each privilege can be disabled or enabled, with the default
being disabled.

The `tables_priv`,
`columns_priv`, and
`procs_priv` tables declare the privilege
columns as [`SET`](set.md "13.3.6 The SET Type") columns. Values in
these columns can contain any combination of the privileges
controlled by the table. Only those privileges listed in the
column value are enabled.

**Table 8.9 Set-Type Privilege Column Values**

| Table Name | Column Name | Possible Set Elements |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `tables_priv` | `Table_priv` | `'Select', 'Insert', 'Update', 'Delete', 'Create', 'Drop', 'Grant', 'References', 'Index', 'Alter', 'Create View', 'Show view', 'Trigger'` |
| `tables_priv` | `Column_priv` | `'Select', 'Insert', 'Update', 'References'` |
| `columns_priv` | `Column_priv` | `'Select', 'Insert', 'Update', 'References'` |
| `procs_priv` | `Proc_priv` | `'Execute', 'Alter Routine', 'Grant'` |

Only the `user` and
`global_grants` tables specify administrative
privileges, such as [`RELOAD`](privileges-provided.md#priv_reload),
[`SHUTDOWN`](privileges-provided.md#priv_shutdown), and
[`SYSTEM_VARIABLES_ADMIN`](privileges-provided.md#priv_system-variables-admin).
Administrative operations are operations on the server itself
and are not database-specific, so there is no reason to list
these privileges in the other grant tables. Consequently, the
server need consult only the `user` and
`global_grants` tables to determine whether a
user can perform an administrative operation.

The [`FILE`](privileges-provided.md#priv_file) privilege also is
specified only in the `user` table. It is not
an administrative privilege as such, but a user's ability to
read or write files on the server host is independent of the
database being accessed.

#### Grant Table Concurrency

As of MySQL 8.0.22, to permit concurrent DML and DDL operations
on MySQL grant tables, read operations that previously acquired
row locks on MySQL grant tables are executed as non-locking
reads. Operations that are performed as non-locking reads on
MySQL grant tables include:

- [`SELECT`](select.md "15.2.13 SELECT Statement") statements and other
  read-only statements that read data from grant tables
  through join lists and subqueries, including
  [`SELECT
  ... FOR SHARE`](innodb-locking-reads.md "17.7.2.4 Locking Reads") statements, using any transaction
  isolation level.
- DML operations that read data from grant tables (through
  join lists or subqueries) but do not modify them, using any
  transaction isolation level.

Statements that no longer acquire row locks when reading data
from grant tables report a warning if executed while using
statement-based replication.

When using
-[`binlog_format=mixed`](replication-options-binary-log.md#sysvar_binlog_format), DML
operations that read data from grant tables are written to the
binary log as row events to make the operations safe for
mixed-mode replication.

[`SELECT ...
FOR SHARE`](innodb-locking-reads.md "17.7.2.4 Locking Reads") statements that read data from grant tables
report a warning. With the `FOR SHARE` clause,
read locks are not supported on grant tables.

DML operations that read data from grant tables and are executed
using the [`SERIALIZABLE`](innodb-transaction-isolation-levels.md#isolevel_serializable)
isolation level report a warning. Read locks that would normally
be acquired when using the
[`SERIALIZABLE`](innodb-transaction-isolation-levels.md#isolevel_serializable) isolation level
are not supported on grant tables.
