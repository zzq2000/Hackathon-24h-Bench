## 12.6 Error Message Character Set

This section describes how the MySQL server uses character sets
for constructing error messages. For information about the
language of error messages (rather than the character set), see
[Section 12.12, “Setting the Error Message Language”](error-message-language.md "12.12 Setting the Error Message Language"). For general information
about configuring error logging, see [Section 7.4.2, “The Error Log”](error-log.md "7.4.2 The Error Log").

- [Character Set for Error Message Disposition](charset-errors.md#charset-errors-disposition "Character Set for Error Message Disposition")

### Character Set for Error Message Construction

The server constructs error messages as follows:

- The message template uses UTF-8
  (`utf8mb3`).
- Parameters in the message template are replaced with values
  that apply to a specific error occurrence:

  - Identifiers such as table or column names use UTF-8
    internally so they are copied as is.
  - Character (nonbinary) string values are converted from
    their character set to UTF-8.
  - Binary string values are copied as is for bytes in the
    range `0x20` to
    `0x7E`, and using `\x`
    hexadecimal encoding for bytes outside that range. For
    example, if a duplicate-key error occurs for an attempt
    to insert `0x41CF9F` into a
    [`VARBINARY`](binary-varbinary.md "13.3.3 The BINARY and VARBINARY Types") unique column,
    the resulting error message uses UTF-8 with some bytes
    hexadecimal encoded:

    ```none
    Duplicate entry 'A\xCF\x9F' for key 1
    ```

### Character Set for Error Message Disposition

An error message, once constructed, can be written by the server
to the error log or sent to clients:

- If the server writes the error message to the error log, it
  writes it in UTF-8, as constructed, without conversion to
  another character set.
- If the server sends the error message to a client program,
  the server converts it from UTF-8 to the character set
  specified by the
  [`character_set_results`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_character_set_results)
  system variable. If
  [`character_set_results`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_character_set_results) has a
  value of `NULL` or
  `binary`, no conversion occurs. No
  conversion occurs if the variable value is
  `utf8mb3` or `utf8mb4`,
  either, because those character sets have a repertoire that
  includes all UTF-8 characters used in message construction.

  If characters cannot be represented in
  [`character_set_results`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_character_set_results), some
  encoding may occur during the conversion. The encoding uses
  Unicode code point values:

  - Characters in the Basic Multilingual Plane (BMP) range
    (`0x0000` to `0xFFFF`)
    are written using
    `\nnnn`
    notation.
  - Characters outside the BMP range
    (`0x10000` to
    `0x10FFFF`) are written using
    `\+nnnnnn`
    notation.

  Clients can set
  [`character_set_results`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_character_set_results) to
  control the character set in which they receive error
  messages. The variable can be set directly, or indirectly by
  means such as [`SET NAMES`](set-names.md "15.7.6.3 SET NAMES Statement"). For
  more information about
  [`character_set_results`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_character_set_results), see
  [Section 12.4, “Connection Character Sets and Collations”](charset-connection.md "12.4 Connection Character Sets and Collations").
