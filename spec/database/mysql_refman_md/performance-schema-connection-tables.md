### 29.12.8 Performance Schema Connection Tables

[29.12.8.1 The accounts Table](performance-schema-accounts-table.md)

[29.12.8.2 The hosts Table](performance-schema-hosts-table.md)

[29.12.8.3 The users Table](performance-schema-users-table.md)

When a client connects to the MySQL server, it does so under a
particular user name and from a particular host. The Performance
Schema provides statistics about these connections, tracking
them per account (user and host combination) as well as
separately per user name and host name, using these tables:

- [`accounts`](performance-schema-accounts-table.md "29.12.8.1 The accounts Table"): Connection statistics
  per client account
- [`hosts`](performance-schema-hosts-table.md "29.12.8.2 The hosts Table"): Connection statistics
  per client host name
- [`users`](performance-schema-users-table.md "29.12.8.3 The users Table"): Connection statistics
  per client user name

The meaning of “account” in the connection tables
is similar to its meaning in the MySQL grant tables in the
`mysql` system database, in the sense that the
term refers to a combination of user and host values. They
differ in that, for grant tables, the host part of an account
can be a pattern, whereas for Performance Schema tables, the
host value is always a specific nonpattern host name.

Each connection table has `CURRENT_CONNECTIONS`
and `TOTAL_CONNECTIONS` columns to track the
current and total number of connections per “tracking
value” on which its statistics are based. The tables
differ in what they use for the tracking value. The
[`accounts`](performance-schema-accounts-table.md "29.12.8.1 The accounts Table") table has
`USER` and `HOST` columns to
track connections per user and host combination. The
[`users`](performance-schema-users-table.md "29.12.8.3 The users Table") and
[`hosts`](performance-schema-hosts-table.md "29.12.8.2 The hosts Table") tables have a
`USER` and `HOST` column,
respectively, to track connections per user name and host name.

The Performance Schema also counts internal threads and threads
for user sessions that failed to authenticate, using rows with
`USER` and `HOST` column
values of `NULL`.

Suppose that clients named `user1` and
`user2` each connect one time from
`hosta` and `hostb`. The
Performance Schema tracks the connections as follows:

- The [`accounts`](performance-schema-accounts-table.md "29.12.8.1 The accounts Table") table has four
  rows, for the
  `user1`/`hosta`,
  `user1`/`hostb`,
  `user2`/`hosta`, and
  `user2`/`hostb` account
  values, each row counting one connection per account.
- The [`hosts`](performance-schema-hosts-table.md "29.12.8.2 The hosts Table") table has two rows,
  for `hosta` and `hostb`,
  each row counting two connections per host name.
- The [`users`](performance-schema-users-table.md "29.12.8.3 The users Table") table has two rows,
  for `user1` and `user2`,
  each row counting two connections per user name.

When a client connects, the Performance Schema determines which
row in each connection table applies, using the tracking value
appropriate to each table. If there is no such row, one is
added. Then the Performance Schema increments by one the
`CURRENT_CONNECTIONS` and
`TOTAL_CONNECTIONS` columns in that row.

When a client disconnects, the Performance Schema decrements by
one the `CURRENT_CONNECTIONS` column in the row
and leaves the `TOTAL_CONNECTIONS` column
unchanged.

[`TRUNCATE TABLE`](truncate-table.md "15.1.37 TRUNCATE TABLE Statement") is permitted for
connection tables. It has these effects:

- Rows are removed for accounts, hosts, or users that have no
  current connections (rows with `CURRENT_CONNECTIONS
  = 0`).
- Nonremoved rows are reset to count only current connections:
  For rows with `CURRENT_CONNECTIONS > 0`,
  `TOTAL_CONNECTIONS` is reset to
  `CURRENT_CONNECTIONS`.
- Summary tables that depend on the connection table are
  implicitly truncated, as described later in this section.

The Performance Schema maintains summary tables that aggregate
connection statistics for various event types by account, host,
or user. These tables have
`_summary_by_account`,
`_summary_by_host`, or
`_summary_by_user` in the name. To identify
them, use this query:

```sql
mysql> SELECT TABLE_NAME FROM INFORMATION_SCHEMA.TABLES
       WHERE TABLE_SCHEMA = 'performance_schema'
       AND TABLE_NAME REGEXP '_summary_by_(account|host|user)'
       ORDER BY TABLE_NAME;
+------------------------------------------------------+
| TABLE_NAME                                           |
+------------------------------------------------------+

| events_errors_summary_by_host_by_error               |

| events_waits_summary_by_host_by_event_name           |

+------------------------------------------------------+
```

For details about individual connection summary tables, consult
the section that describes tables for the summarized event type:

- Wait event summaries:
  [Section 29.12.20.1, “Wait Event Summary Tables”](performance-schema-wait-summary-tables.md "29.12.20.1 Wait Event Summary Tables")
- Stage event summaries:
  [Section 29.12.20.2, “Stage Summary Tables”](performance-schema-stage-summary-tables.md "29.12.20.2 Stage Summary Tables")
- Statement event summaries:
  [Section 29.12.20.3, “Statement Summary Tables”](performance-schema-statement-summary-tables.md "29.12.20.3 Statement Summary Tables")
- Transaction event summaries:
  [Section 29.12.20.5, “Transaction Summary Tables”](performance-schema-transaction-summary-tables.md "29.12.20.5 Transaction Summary Tables")
- Memory event summaries:
  [Section 29.12.20.10, “Memory Summary Tables”](performance-schema-memory-summary-tables.md "29.12.20.10 Memory Summary Tables")
- Error event summaries:
  [Section 29.12.20.11, “Error Summary Tables”](performance-schema-error-summary-tables.md "29.12.20.11 Error Summary Tables")

[`TRUNCATE TABLE`](truncate-table.md "15.1.37 TRUNCATE TABLE Statement") is permitted for
connection summary tables. It removes rows for accounts, hosts,
or users with no connections, and resets the summary columns to
zero for the remaining rows. In addition, each summary table
that is aggregated by account, host, user, or thread is
implicitly truncated by truncation of the connection table on
which it depends. The following table describes the relationship
between connection table truncation and implicitly truncated
tables.

**Table 29.2 Implicit Effects of Connection Table Truncation**

| Truncated Connection Table | Implicitly Truncated Summary Tables |
| --- | --- |
| `accounts` | Tables with names containing `_summary_by_account`, `_summary_by_thread` |
| `hosts` | Tables with names containing `_summary_by_account`, `_summary_by_host`, `_summary_by_thread` |
| `users` | Tables with names containing `_summary_by_account`, `_summary_by_user`, `_summary_by_thread` |

Truncating a `_summary_global` summary table
also implicitly truncates its corresponding connection and
thread summary tables. For example, truncating
[`events_waits_summary_global_by_event_name`](performance-schema-wait-summary-tables.md "29.12.20.1 Wait Event Summary Tables")
implicitly truncates the wait event summary tables that are
aggregated by account, host, user, or thread.
