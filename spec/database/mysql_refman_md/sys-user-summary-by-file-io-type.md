#### 30.4.3.43 The user\_summary\_by\_file\_io\_type and x$user\_summary\_by\_file\_io\_type Views

These views summarize file I/O, grouped by user and event
type. By default, rows are sorted by user and descending total
latency.

The [`user_summary_by_file_io_type`](sys-user-summary-by-file-io-type.md "30.4.3.43 The user_summary_by_file_io_type and x$user_summary_by_file_io_type Views")
and
[`x$user_summary_by_file_io_type`](sys-user-summary-by-file-io-type.md "30.4.3.43 The user_summary_by_file_io_type and x$user_summary_by_file_io_type Views")
views have these columns:

- `user`

  The client user name. Rows for which the
  `USER` column in the underlying
  Performance Schema table is `NULL` are
  assumed to be for background threads and are reported with
  a host name of `background`.
- `event_name`

  The file I/O event name.
- `total`

  The total number of occurrences of the file I/O event for
  the user.
- `latency`

  The total wait time of timed occurrences of the file I/O
  event for the user.
- `max_latency`

  The maximum single wait time of timed occurrences of the
  file I/O event for the user.
