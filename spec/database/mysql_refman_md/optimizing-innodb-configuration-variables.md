### 10.5.9 Optimizing InnoDB Configuration Variables

Different settings work best for servers with light, predictable
loads, versus servers that are running near full capacity all
the time, or that experience spikes of high activity.

Because the `InnoDB` storage engine performs
many of its optimizations automatically, many performance-tuning
tasks involve monitoring to ensure that the database is
performing well, and changing configuration options when
performance drops. See
[Section 17.16, “InnoDB Integration with MySQL Performance Schema”](innodb-performance-schema.md "17.16 InnoDB Integration with MySQL Performance Schema") for information
about detailed `InnoDB` performance monitoring.

The main configuration steps you can perform include:

- Controlling the types of data change operations for which
  `InnoDB` buffers the changed data, to avoid
  frequent small disk writes. See
  [Configuring Change Buffering](innodb-change-buffer.md#innodb-change-buffer-configuration "Configuring Change Buffering").
  Because the default is to buffer all types of data change
  operations, only change this setting if you need to reduce
  the amount of buffering.
- Turning the adaptive hash indexing feature on and off using
  the
  [`innodb_adaptive_hash_index`](innodb-parameters.md#sysvar_innodb_adaptive_hash_index)
  option. See [Section 17.5.3, “Adaptive Hash Index”](innodb-adaptive-hash.md "17.5.3 Adaptive Hash Index") for more
  information. You might change this setting during periods of
  unusual activity, then restore it to its original setting.
- Setting a limit on the number of concurrent threads that
  `InnoDB` processes, if context switching is
  a bottleneck. See
  [Section 17.8.4, “Configuring Thread Concurrency for InnoDB”](innodb-performance-thread_concurrency.md "17.8.4 Configuring Thread Concurrency for InnoDB").
- Controlling the amount of prefetching that
  `InnoDB` does with its read-ahead
  operations. When the system has unused I/O capacity, more
  read-ahead can improve the performance of queries. Too much
  read-ahead can cause periodic drops in performance on a
  heavily loaded system. See
  [Section 17.8.3.4, “Configuring InnoDB Buffer Pool Prefetching (Read-Ahead)”](innodb-performance-read_ahead.md "17.8.3.4 Configuring InnoDB Buffer Pool Prefetching (Read-Ahead)").
- Increasing the number of background threads for read or
  write operations, if you have a high-end I/O subsystem that
  is not fully utilized by the default values. See
  [Section 17.8.5, “Configuring the Number of Background InnoDB I/O Threads”](innodb-performance-multiple_io_threads.md "17.8.5 Configuring the Number of Background InnoDB I/O Threads").
- Controlling how much I/O `InnoDB` performs
  in the background. See
  [Section 17.8.7, “Configuring InnoDB I/O Capacity”](innodb-configuring-io-capacity.md "17.8.7 Configuring InnoDB I/O Capacity"). You might
  scale back this setting if you observe periodic drops in
  performance.
- Controlling the algorithm that determines when
  `InnoDB` performs certain types of
  background writes. See
  [Section 17.8.3.5, “Configuring Buffer Pool Flushing”](innodb-buffer-pool-flushing.md "17.8.3.5 Configuring Buffer Pool Flushing"). The algorithm
  works for some types of workloads but not others, so you
  might disable this feature if you observe periodic drops in
  performance.
- Taking advantage of multicore processors and their cache
  memory configuration, to minimize delays in context
  switching. See
  [Section 17.8.8, “Configuring Spin Lock Polling”](innodb-performance-spin_lock_polling.md "17.8.8 Configuring Spin Lock Polling").
- Preventing one-time operations such as table scans from
  interfering with the frequently accessed data stored in the
  `InnoDB` buffer cache. See
  [Section 17.8.3.3, “Making the Buffer Pool Scan Resistant”](innodb-performance-midpoint_insertion.md "17.8.3.3 Making the Buffer Pool Scan Resistant").
- Adjusting log files to a size that makes sense for
  reliability and crash recovery. `InnoDB`
  log files have often been kept small to avoid long startup
  times after a crash. Optimizations introduced in MySQL 5.5
  speed up certain steps of the crash
  [recovery](glossary.md#glos_crash_recovery "crash recovery") process.
  In particular, scanning the
  [redo log](glossary.md#glos_redo_log "redo log") and applying
  the redo log are faster due to improved algorithms for
  memory management. If you have kept your log files
  artificially small to avoid long startup times, you can now
  consider increasing log file size to reduce the I/O that
  occurs due recycling of redo log records.
- Configuring the size and number of instances for the
  `InnoDB` buffer pool, especially important
  for systems with multi-gigabyte buffer pools. See
  [Section 17.8.3.2, “Configuring Multiple Buffer Pool Instances”](innodb-multiple-buffer-pools.md "17.8.3.2 Configuring Multiple Buffer Pool Instances").
- Increasing the maximum number of concurrent transactions,
  which dramatically improves scalability for the busiest
  databases. See [Section 17.6.6, “Undo Logs”](innodb-undo-logs.md "17.6.6 Undo Logs").
- Moving purge operations (a type of garbage collection) into
  a background thread. See
  [Section 17.8.9, “Purge Configuration”](innodb-purge-configuration.md "17.8.9 Purge Configuration"). To effectively
  measure the results of this setting, tune the other
  I/O-related and thread-related configuration settings first.
- Reducing the amount of switching that
  `InnoDB` does between concurrent threads,
  so that SQL operations on a busy server do not queue up and
  form a “traffic jam”. Set a value for the
  [`innodb_thread_concurrency`](innodb-parameters.md#sysvar_innodb_thread_concurrency)
  option, up to approximately 32 for a high-powered modern
  system. Increase the value for the
  [`innodb_concurrency_tickets`](innodb-parameters.md#sysvar_innodb_concurrency_tickets)
  option, typically to 5000 or so. This combination of options
  sets a cap on the number of threads that
  `InnoDB` processes at any one time, and
  allows each thread to do substantial work before being
  swapped out, so that the number of waiting threads stays low
  and operations can complete without excessive context
  switching.
