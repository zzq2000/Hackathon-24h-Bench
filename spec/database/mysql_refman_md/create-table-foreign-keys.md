#### 15.1.20.5 FOREIGN KEY Constraints

MySQL supports foreign keys, which permit cross-referencing
related data across tables, and foreign key constraints, which
help keep the related data consistent.

A foreign key relationship involves a parent table that holds
the initial column values, and a child table with column values
that reference the parent column values. A foreign key
constraint is defined on the child table.

The essential syntax for a defining a foreign key constraint in
a [`CREATE TABLE`](create-table.md "15.1.20 CREATE TABLE Statement") or
[`ALTER TABLE`](alter-table.md "15.1.9 ALTER TABLE Statement") statement includes
the following:

```sql
[CONSTRAINT [symbol]] FOREIGN KEY
    [index_name] (col_name, ...)
    REFERENCES tbl_name (col_name,...)
    [ON DELETE reference_option]
    [ON UPDATE reference_option]

reference_option:
    RESTRICT | CASCADE | SET NULL | NO ACTION | SET DEFAULT
```

Foreign key constraint usage is described under the following
topics in this section:

- [Identifiers](create-table-foreign-keys.md#foreign-key-identifiers "Identifiers")
- [Conditions and Restrictions](create-table-foreign-keys.md#foreign-key-restrictions "Conditions and Restrictions")

- [Dropping Foreign Key Constraints](create-table-foreign-keys.md#foreign-key-dropping "Dropping Foreign Key Constraints")
- [Foreign Key Checks](create-table-foreign-keys.md#foreign-key-checks "Foreign Key Checks")
- [Locking](create-table-foreign-keys.md#foreign-key-locking "Locking")
- [Foreign Key Definitions and Metadata](create-table-foreign-keys.md#foreign-key-metadata "Foreign Key Definitions and Metadata")
- [Foreign Key Errors](create-table-foreign-keys.md#foreign-key-errors "Foreign Key Errors")

##### Identifiers

Foreign key constraint naming is governed by the following
rules:

- The `CONSTRAINT`
  *`symbol`* value is used, if
  defined.
- If the `CONSTRAINT`
  *`symbol`* clause is not defined,
  or a symbol is not included following the
  `CONSTRAINT` keyword, a constraint name
  name is generated automatically.

  Prior to MySQL 8.0.16, if the
  `CONSTRAINT`
  *`symbol`* clause was not defined,
  or a symbol was not included following the
  `CONSTRAINT` keyword, both
  [`InnoDB`](innodb-storage-engine.md "Chapter 17 The InnoDB Storage Engine") and
  [`NDB`](mysql-cluster.md "Chapter 25 MySQL NDB Cluster 8.0") storage engines would use
  the `FOREIGN_KEY
  index_name` if
  defined. In MySQL 8.0.16 and higher, the
  `FOREIGN_KEY
  index_name` is
  ignored.
- The `CONSTRAINT
  symbol` value, if
  defined, must be unique in the database. A duplicate
  *`symbol`* results in an error
  similar to: ERROR 1005 (HY000): Can't create
  table 'test.fk1' (errno: 121).
- NDB Cluster stores foreign names using the same lettercase
  with which they are created. Prior to version 8.0.20, when
  processing [`SELECT`](select.md "15.2.13 SELECT Statement") and other
  SQL statements, [`NDB`](mysql-cluster.md "Chapter 25 MySQL NDB Cluster 8.0") compared
  the names of foreign keys in such statements with the
  names as stored in a case-sensitive fashion when
  [`lower_case_table_names`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_lower_case_table_names)
  was equal to 0. In NDB 8.0.20 and later, this value no
  longer has any effect on how such comparisons are made,
  and they are always done without regard to lettercase.
  (Bug #30512043)

Table and column identifiers in a `FOREIGN KEY ...
REFERENCES` clause can be quoted within backticks
(`` ` ``). Alternatively, double quotation marks
(`"`) can be used if the
[`ANSI_QUOTES`](sql-mode.md#sqlmode_ansi_quotes) SQL mode is
enabled. The
[`lower_case_table_names`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_lower_case_table_names) system
variable setting is also taken into account.

##### Conditions and Restrictions

Foreign key constraints are subject to the following
conditions and restrictions:

- Parent and child tables must use the same storage engine,
  and they cannot be defined as temporary tables.
- Creating a foreign key constraint requires the
  [`REFERENCES`](privileges-provided.md#priv_references) privilege on the
  parent table.
- Corresponding columns in the foreign key and the
  referenced key must have similar data types. *The
  size and sign of fixed precision types such as
  [`INTEGER`](integer-types.md "13.1.2 Integer Types (Exact Value) - INTEGER, INT, SMALLINT, TINYINT, MEDIUMINT, BIGINT") and
  [`DECIMAL`](fixed-point-types.md "13.1.3 Fixed-Point Types (Exact Value) - DECIMAL, NUMERIC") must be the
  same*. The length of string types need not be
  the same. For nonbinary (character) string columns, the
  character set and collation must be the same.
- MySQL supports foreign key references between one column
  and another within a table. (A column cannot have a
  foreign key reference to itself.) In these cases, a
  “child table record” refers to a dependent
  record within the same table.
- MySQL requires indexes on foreign keys and referenced keys
  so that foreign key checks can be fast and not require a
  table scan. In the referencing table, there must be an
  index where the foreign key columns are listed as the
  *first* columns in the same order. Such
  an index is created on the referencing table automatically
  if it does not exist. This index might be silently dropped
  later if you create another index that can be used to
  enforce the foreign key constraint.
  *`index_name`*, if given, is used
  as described previously.
- `InnoDB` permits a foreign key to
  reference any index column or group of columns. However,
  in the referenced table, there must be an index where the
  referenced columns are the *first*
  columns in the same order. Hidden columns that
  `InnoDB` adds to an index are also
  considered (see [Section 17.6.2.1, “Clustered and Secondary Indexes”](innodb-index-types.md "17.6.2.1 Clustered and Secondary Indexes")).

  `NDB` requires an explicit unique key (or
  primary key) on any column referenced as a foreign key.
  `InnoDB` does not, which is an extension
  of standard SQL.
- Index prefixes on foreign key columns are not supported.
  Consequently, [`BLOB`](blob.md "13.3.4 The BLOB and TEXT Types") and
  [`TEXT`](blob.md "13.3.4 The BLOB and TEXT Types") columns cannot be
  included in a foreign key because indexes on those columns
  must always include a prefix length.
- [`InnoDB`](innodb-storage-engine.md "Chapter 17 The InnoDB Storage Engine") does not currently
  support foreign keys for tables with user-defined
  partitioning. This includes both parent and child tables.

  This restriction does not apply for
  [`NDB`](mysql-cluster.md "Chapter 25 MySQL NDB Cluster 8.0") tables that are
  partitioned by `KEY` or `LINEAR
  KEY` (the only user partitioning types supported
  by the `NDB` storage engine); these may
  have foreign key references or be the targets of such
  references.
- A table in a foreign key relationship cannot be altered to
  use another storage engine. To change the storage engine,
  you must drop any foreign key constraints first.
- A foreign key constraint cannot reference a virtual
  generated column.

For information about how the MySQL implementation of foreign
key constraints differs from the SQL standard, see
[Section 1.6.2.3, “FOREIGN KEY Constraint Differences”](ansi-diff-foreign-keys.md "1.6.2.3 FOREIGN KEY Constraint Differences").

##### Referential Actions

When an [`UPDATE`](update.md "15.2.17 UPDATE Statement") or
[`DELETE`](delete.md "15.2.2 DELETE Statement") operation affects a key
value in the parent table that has matching rows in the child
table, the result depends on the *referential
action* specified by `ON UPDATE`
and `ON DELETE` subclauses of the
`FOREIGN KEY` clause. Referential actions
include:

- `CASCADE`: Delete or update the row from
  the parent table and automatically delete or update the
  matching rows in the child table. Both `ON DELETE
  CASCADE` and `ON UPDATE CASCADE`
  are supported. Between two tables, do not define several
  `ON UPDATE CASCADE` clauses that act on
  the same column in the parent table or in the child table.

  If a `FOREIGN KEY` clause is defined on
  both tables in a foreign key relationship, making both
  tables a parent and child, an `ON UPDATE
  CASCADE` or `ON DELETE CASCADE`
  subclause defined for one `FOREIGN KEY`
  clause must be defined for the other in order for
  cascading operations to succeed. If an `ON UPDATE
  CASCADE` or `ON DELETE CASCADE`
  subclause is only defined for one `FOREIGN
  KEY` clause, cascading operations fail with an
  error.

  Note

  Cascaded foreign key actions do not activate triggers.
- `SET NULL`: Delete or update the row from
  the parent table and set the foreign key column or columns
  in the child table to `NULL`. Both
  `ON DELETE SET NULL` and `ON
  UPDATE SET NULL` clauses are supported.

  If you specify a `SET NULL` action,
  *make sure that you have not declared the columns
  in the child table as `NOT
  NULL`*.
- `RESTRICT`: Rejects the delete or update
  operation for the parent table. Specifying
  `RESTRICT` (or `NO
  ACTION`) is the same as omitting the `ON
  DELETE` or `ON UPDATE` clause.
- `NO ACTION`: A keyword from standard SQL.
  For [`InnoDB`](innodb-storage-engine.md "Chapter 17 The InnoDB Storage Engine"), this is
  equivalent to `RESTRICT`; the delete or
  update operation for the parent table is immediately
  rejected if there is a related foreign key value in the
  referenced table. [`NDB`](mysql-cluster.md "Chapter 25 MySQL NDB Cluster 8.0")
  supports deferred checks, and `NO ACTION`
  specifies a deferred check; when this is used, constraint
  checks are not performed until commit time. Note that for
  `NDB` tables, this causes all foreign key
  checks made for both parent and child tables to be
  deferred.
- `SET DEFAULT`: This action is recognized
  by the MySQL parser, but both
  [`InnoDB`](innodb-storage-engine.md "Chapter 17 The InnoDB Storage Engine") and
  [`NDB`](mysql-cluster.md "Chapter 25 MySQL NDB Cluster 8.0") reject table definitions
  containing `ON DELETE SET DEFAULT` or
  `ON UPDATE SET DEFAULT` clauses.

For storage engines that support foreign keys, MySQL rejects
any [`INSERT`](insert.md "15.2.7 INSERT Statement") or
[`UPDATE`](update.md "15.2.17 UPDATE Statement") operation that attempts
to create a foreign key value in a child table if there is no
matching candidate key value in the parent table.

For an `ON DELETE` or `ON
UPDATE` that is not specified, the default action is
always `NO ACTION`.

As the default, an `ON DELETE NO ACTION` or
`ON UPDATE NO ACTION` clause that is
specified explicitly does not appear in
[`SHOW CREATE TABLE`](show-create-table.md "15.7.7.10 SHOW CREATE TABLE Statement") output or in
tables dumped with [**mysqldump**](mysqldump.md "6.5.4 mysqldump — A Database Backup Program").
`RESTRICT`, which is an equivalent
non-default keyword, appears in [`SHOW
CREATE TABLE`](show-create-table.md "15.7.7.10 SHOW CREATE TABLE Statement") output and in tables dumped with
[**mysqldump**](mysqldump.md "6.5.4 mysqldump — A Database Backup Program").

For [`NDB`](mysql-cluster.md "Chapter 25 MySQL NDB Cluster 8.0") tables, `ON
UPDATE CASCADE` is not supported where the reference
is to the parent table's primary key.

As of NDB 8.0.16: For [`NDB`](mysql-cluster.md "Chapter 25 MySQL NDB Cluster 8.0") tables,
`ON DELETE CASCADE` is not supported where
the child table contains one or more columns of any of the
[`TEXT`](blob.md "13.3.4 The BLOB and TEXT Types") or
[`BLOB`](blob.md "13.3.4 The BLOB and TEXT Types") types. (Bug #89511, Bug
#27484882)

`InnoDB` performs cascading operations using
a depth-first search algorithm on the records of the index
that corresponds to the foreign key constraint.

A foreign key constraint on a stored generated column cannot
use `CASCADE`, `SET NULL`,
or `SET DEFAULT` as `ON
UPDATE` referential actions, nor can it use
`SET NULL` or `SET DEFAULT`
as `ON DELETE` referential actions.

A foreign key constraint on the base column of a stored
generated column cannot use `CASCADE`,
`SET NULL`, or `SET DEFAULT`
as `ON UPDATE` or `ON
DELETE` referential actions.

##### Foreign Key Constraint Examples

This simple example relates `parent` and
`child` tables through a single-column
foreign key:

```sql
CREATE TABLE parent (
    id INT NOT NULL,
    PRIMARY KEY (id)
) ENGINE=INNODB;

CREATE TABLE child (
    id INT,
    parent_id INT,
    INDEX par_ind (parent_id),
    FOREIGN KEY (parent_id)
        REFERENCES parent(id)
        ON DELETE CASCADE
) ENGINE=INNODB;
```

This is a more complex example in which a
`product_order` table has foreign keys for
two other tables. One foreign key references a two-column
index in the `product` table. The other
references a single-column index in the
`customer` table:

```sql
CREATE TABLE product (
    category INT NOT NULL, id INT NOT NULL,
    price DECIMAL,
    PRIMARY KEY(category, id)
)   ENGINE=INNODB;

CREATE TABLE customer (
    id INT NOT NULL,
    PRIMARY KEY (id)
)   ENGINE=INNODB;

CREATE TABLE product_order (
    no INT NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT,
    product_category INT NOT NULL,
    product_id INT NOT NULL,
    customer_id INT NOT NULL,

    PRIMARY KEY(no),
    INDEX (product_category, product_id),
    INDEX (customer_id),

    FOREIGN KEY (product_category, product_id)
      REFERENCES product(category, id)
      ON UPDATE CASCADE ON DELETE RESTRICT,

    FOREIGN KEY (customer_id)
      REFERENCES customer(id)
)   ENGINE=INNODB;
```

##### Adding Foreign Key Constraints

You can add a foreign key constraint to an existing table
using the following [`ALTER TABLE`](alter-table.md "15.1.9 ALTER TABLE Statement")
syntax:

```sql
ALTER TABLE tbl_name
    ADD [CONSTRAINT [symbol]] FOREIGN KEY
    [index_name] (col_name, ...)
    REFERENCES tbl_name (col_name,...)
    [ON DELETE reference_option]
    [ON UPDATE reference_option]
```

The foreign key can be self referential (referring to the same
table). When you add a foreign key constraint to a table using
[`ALTER TABLE`](alter-table.md "15.1.9 ALTER TABLE Statement"), *remember
to first create an index on the column(s) referenced by the
foreign key.*

##### Dropping Foreign Key Constraints

You can drop a foreign key constraint using the following
[`ALTER TABLE`](alter-table.md "15.1.9 ALTER TABLE Statement") syntax:

```sql
ALTER TABLE tbl_name DROP FOREIGN KEY fk_symbol;
```

If the `FOREIGN KEY` clause defined a
`CONSTRAINT` name when you created the
constraint, you can refer to that name to drop the foreign key
constraint. Otherwise, a constraint name was generated
internally, and you must use that value. To determine the
foreign key constraint name, use [`SHOW
CREATE TABLE`](show-create-table.md "15.7.7.10 SHOW CREATE TABLE Statement"):

```sql
mysql> SHOW CREATE TABLE child\G
*************************** 1. row ***************************
       Table: child
Create Table: CREATE TABLE `child` (
  `id` int DEFAULT NULL,
  `parent_id` int DEFAULT NULL,
  KEY `par_ind` (`parent_id`),
  CONSTRAINT `child_ibfk_1` FOREIGN KEY (`parent_id`)
  REFERENCES `parent` (`id`) ON DELETE CASCADE
) ENGINE=InnoDB DEFAULT CHARSET=utf8mb4 COLLATE=utf8mb4_0900_ai_ci

mysql> ALTER TABLE child DROP FOREIGN KEY `child_ibfk_1`;
```

Adding and dropping a foreign key in the same
[`ALTER TABLE`](alter-table.md "15.1.9 ALTER TABLE Statement") statement is
supported for
[`ALTER TABLE ...
ALGORITHM=INPLACE`](alter-table.md "15.1.9 ALTER TABLE Statement"). It is not supported for
[`ALTER TABLE ...
ALGORITHM=COPY`](alter-table.md "15.1.9 ALTER TABLE Statement").

##### Foreign Key Checks

In MySQL, InnoDB and NDB tables support checking of foreign
key constraints. Foreign key checking is controlled by the
[`foreign_key_checks`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_foreign_key_checks) variable,
which is enabled by default. Typically, you leave this
variable enabled during normal operation to enforce
referential integrity. The
[`foreign_key_checks`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_foreign_key_checks) variable
has the same effect on [`NDB`](mysql-cluster.md "Chapter 25 MySQL NDB Cluster 8.0") tables
as it does for [`InnoDB`](innodb-storage-engine.md "Chapter 17 The InnoDB Storage Engine") tables.

The [`foreign_key_checks`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_foreign_key_checks)
variable is dynamic and supports both global and session
scopes. For information about using system variables, see
[Section 7.1.9, “Using System Variables”](using-system-variables.md "7.1.9 Using System Variables").

Disabling foreign key checking is useful when:

- Dropping a table that is referenced by a foreign key
  constraint. A referenced table can only be dropped after
  [`foreign_key_checks`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_foreign_key_checks) is
  disabled. When you drop a table, constraints defined on
  the table are also dropped.
- Reloading tables in different order than required by their
  foreign key relationships. For example,
  [**mysqldump**](mysqldump.md "6.5.4 mysqldump — A Database Backup Program") produces correct definitions
  of tables in the dump file, including foreign key
  constraints for child tables. To make it easier to reload
  dump files for tables with foreign key relationships,
  [**mysqldump**](mysqldump.md "6.5.4 mysqldump — A Database Backup Program") automatically includes a
  statement in the dump output that disables
  [`foreign_key_checks`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_foreign_key_checks). This
  enables you to import the tables in any order in case the
  dump file contains tables that are not correctly ordered
  for foreign keys. Disabling
  [`foreign_key_checks`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_foreign_key_checks) also
  speeds up the import operation by avoiding foreign key
  checks.
- Executing [`LOAD DATA`](load-data.md "15.2.9 LOAD DATA Statement")
  operations, to avoid foreign key checking.
- Performing an [`ALTER TABLE`](alter-table.md "15.1.9 ALTER TABLE Statement")
  operation on a table that has a foreign key relationship.

When [`foreign_key_checks`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_foreign_key_checks) is
disabled, foreign key constraints are ignored, with the
following exceptions:

- Recreating a table that was previously dropped returns an
  error if the table definition does not conform to the
  foreign key constraints that reference the table. The
  table must have the correct column names and types. It
  must also have indexes on the referenced keys. If these
  requirements are not satisfied, MySQL returns Error 1005
  that refers to errno: 150 in the error message, which
  means that a foreign key constraint was not correctly
  formed.
- Altering a table returns an error (errno: 150) if a
  foreign key definition is incorrectly formed for the
  altered table.
- Dropping an index required by a foreign key constraint.
  The foreign key constraint must be removed before dropping
  the index.
- Creating a foreign key constraint where a column
  references a nonmatching column type.

Disabling [`foreign_key_checks`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_foreign_key_checks)
has these additional implications:

- It is permitted to drop a database that contains tables
  with foreign keys that are referenced by tables outside
  the database.
- It is permitted to drop a table with foreign keys
  referenced by other tables.
- Enabling
  [`foreign_key_checks`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_foreign_key_checks) does
  not trigger a scan of table data, which means that rows
  added to a table while
  [`foreign_key_checks`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_foreign_key_checks) is
  disabled are not checked for consistency when
  [`foreign_key_checks`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_foreign_key_checks) is
  re-enabled.

##### Locking

MySQL extends metadata locks, as necessary, to tables that are
related by a foreign key constraint. Extending metadata locks
prevents conflicting DML and DDL operations from executing
concurrently on related tables. This feature also enables
updates to foreign key metadata when a parent table is
modified. In earlier MySQL releases, foreign key metadata,
which is owned by the child table, could not be updated
safely.

If a table is locked explicitly with [`LOCK
TABLES`](lock-tables.md "15.3.6 LOCK TABLES and UNLOCK TABLES Statements"), any tables related by a foreign key
constraint are opened and locked implicitly. For foreign key
checks, a shared read-only lock
([`LOCK TABLES
READ`](lock-tables.md "15.3.6 LOCK TABLES and UNLOCK TABLES Statements")) is taken on related tables. For cascading
updates, a shared-nothing write lock
([`LOCK TABLES
WRITE`](lock-tables.md "15.3.6 LOCK TABLES and UNLOCK TABLES Statements")) is taken on related tables that are involved
in the operation.

##### Foreign Key Definitions and Metadata

To view a foreign key definition, use
[`SHOW CREATE TABLE`](show-create-table.md "15.7.7.10 SHOW CREATE TABLE Statement"):

```sql
mysql> SHOW CREATE TABLE child\G
*************************** 1. row ***************************
       Table: child
Create Table: CREATE TABLE `child` (
  `id` int DEFAULT NULL,
  `parent_id` int DEFAULT NULL,
  KEY `par_ind` (`parent_id`),
  CONSTRAINT `child_ibfk_1` FOREIGN KEY (`parent_id`)
  REFERENCES `parent` (`id`) ON DELETE CASCADE
) ENGINE=InnoDB DEFAULT CHARSET=utf8mb4 COLLATE=utf8mb4_0900_ai_ci
```

You can obtain information about foreign keys from the
Information Schema
[`KEY_COLUMN_USAGE`](information-schema-key-column-usage-table.md "28.3.16 The INFORMATION_SCHEMA KEY_COLUMN_USAGE Table") table. An
example of a query against this table is shown here:

```sql
mysql> SELECT TABLE_SCHEMA, TABLE_NAME, COLUMN_NAME, CONSTRAINT_NAME
       FROM INFORMATION_SCHEMA.KEY_COLUMN_USAGE
       WHERE REFERENCED_TABLE_SCHEMA IS NOT NULL;
+--------------+------------+-------------+-----------------+
| TABLE_SCHEMA | TABLE_NAME | COLUMN_NAME | CONSTRAINT_NAME |
+--------------+------------+-------------+-----------------+
| test         | child      | parent_id   | child_ibfk_1    |
+--------------+------------+-------------+-----------------+
```

You can obtain information specific to
`InnoDB` foreign keys from the
[`INNODB_FOREIGN`](information-schema-innodb-foreign-table.md "28.4.12 The INFORMATION_SCHEMA INNODB_FOREIGN Table") and
[`INNODB_FOREIGN_COLS`](information-schema-innodb-foreign-cols-table.md "28.4.13 The INFORMATION_SCHEMA INNODB_FOREIGN_COLS Table") tables.
Example queries are show here:

```sql
mysql> SELECT * FROM INFORMATION_SCHEMA.INNODB_FOREIGN \G
*************************** 1. row ***************************
      ID: test/child_ibfk_1
FOR_NAME: test/child
REF_NAME: test/parent
  N_COLS: 1
    TYPE: 1

mysql> SELECT * FROM INFORMATION_SCHEMA.INNODB_FOREIGN_COLS \G
*************************** 1. row ***************************
          ID: test/child_ibfk_1
FOR_COL_NAME: parent_id
REF_COL_NAME: id
         POS: 0
```

##### Foreign Key Errors

In the event of a foreign key error involving
`InnoDB` tables (usually Error 150 in the
MySQL Server), information about the latest foreign key error
can be obtained by checking
[`SHOW ENGINE
INNODB STATUS`](show-engine.md "15.7.7.15 SHOW ENGINE Statement") output.

```sql
mysql> SHOW ENGINE INNODB STATUS\G

Warning

If a user has table-level privileges for all parent tables,
[`ER_NO_REFERENCED_ROW_2`](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/mysql-errors/8.0/en/server-error-reference.html#error_er_no_referenced_row_2) and
[`ER_ROW_IS_REFERENCED_2`](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/mysql-errors/8.0/en/server-error-reference.html#error_er_row_is_referenced_2) error
messages for foreign key operations expose information about
parent tables. If a user does not have table-level
privileges for all parent tables, more generic error
messages are displayed instead
([`ER_NO_REFERENCED_ROW`](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/mysql-errors/8.0/en/server-error-reference.html#error_er_no_referenced_row) and
[`ER_ROW_IS_REFERENCED`](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/mysql-errors/8.0/en/server-error-reference.html#error_er_row_is_referenced)).

An exception is that, for stored programs defined to execute
with `DEFINER` privileges, the user against
which privileges are assessed is the user in the program
`DEFINER` clause, not the invoking user. If
that user has table-level parent table privileges, parent
table information is still displayed. In this case, it is
the responsibility of the stored program creator to hide the
information by including appropriate condition handlers.
