### 7.1.16 Resource Groups

MySQL supports creation and management of resource groups, and
permits assigning threads running within the server to particular
groups so that threads execute according to the resources
available to the group. Group attributes enable control over its
resources, to enable or restrict resource consumption by threads
in the group. DBAs can modify these attributes as appropriate for
different workloads.

Currently, CPU time is a manageable resource, represented by the
concept of “virtual CPU” as a term that includes CPU
cores, hyperthreads, hardware threads, and so forth. The server
determines at startup how many virtual CPUs are available, and
database administrators with appropriate privileges can associate
these CPUs with resource groups and assign threads to groups.

For example, to manage execution of batch jobs that need not
execute with high priority, a DBA can create a
`Batch` resource group, and adjust its priority
up or down depending on how busy the server is. (Perhaps batch
jobs assigned to the group should run at lower priority during the
day and at higher priority during the night.) The DBA can also
adjust the set of CPUs available to the group. Groups can be
enabled or disabled to control whether threads are assignable to
them.

The following sections describe aspects of resource group use in
MySQL:

- [Resource Group Elements](resource-groups.md#resource-group-elements "Resource Group Elements")
- [Resource Group Attributes](resource-groups.md#resource-group-attributes "Resource Group Attributes")
- [Resource Group Management](resource-groups.md#resource-group-management "Resource Group Management")
- [Resource Group Replication](resource-groups.md#resource-group-replication "Resource Group Replication")
- [Resource Group Restrictions](resource-groups.md#resource-group-restrictions "Resource Group Restrictions")

Important

On some platforms or MySQL server configurations, resource
groups are unavailable or have limitations. In particular, Linux
systems might require a manual step for some installation
methods. For details, see
[Resource Group Restrictions](resource-groups.md#resource-group-restrictions "Resource Group Restrictions").

#### Resource Group Elements

These capabilities provide the SQL interface for resource group
management in MySQL:

- SQL statements enable creating, altering, and dropping
  resource groups, and enable assigning threads to resource
  groups. An optimizer hint enables assigning individual
  statements to resource groups.
- Resource group privileges provide control over which users
  can perform resource group operations.
- The Information Schema
  [`RESOURCE_GROUPS`](information-schema-resource-groups-table.md "28.3.26 The INFORMATION_SCHEMA RESOURCE_GROUPS Table") table exposes
  information about resource group definitions and the
  Performance Schema [`threads`](performance-schema-threads-table.md "29.12.21.8 The threads Table")
  table shows the resource group assignment for each thread.
- Status variables provide execution counts for each
  management SQL statement.

#### Resource Group Attributes

Resource groups have attributes that define the group. All
attributes can be set at group creation time. Some attributes
are fixed at creation time; others can be modified any time
thereafter.

These attributes are defined at resource group creation time and
cannot be modified:

- Each group has a name. Resource group names are identifiers
  like table and column names, and need not be quoted in SQL
  statements unless they contain special characters or are
  reserved words. Group names are not case-sensitive and may
  be up to 64 characters long.
- Each group has a type, which is either
  `SYSTEM` or `USER`. The
  resource group type affects the range of priority values
  assignable to the group, as described later. This attribute
  together with the differences in permitted priorities
  enables system threads to be identified so as to protect
  them from contention for CPU resources against user threads.

  System and user threads correspond to background and
  foreground threads as listed in the Performance Schema
  [`threads`](performance-schema-threads-table.md "29.12.21.8 The threads Table") table.

These attributes are defined at resource group creation time and
can be modified any time thereafter:

- The CPU affinity is the set of virtual CPUs the resource
  group can use. An affinity can be any nonempty subset of the
  available CPUs. If a group has no affinity, it can use all
  available CPUs.
- The thread priority is the execution priority for threads
  assigned to the resource group. Priority values range from
  -20 (highest priority) to 19 (lowest priority). The default
  priority is 0, for both system and user groups.

  System groups are permitted a higher priority than user
  groups, ensuring that user threads never have a higher
  priority than system threads:

  - For system resource groups, the permitted priority range
    is -20 to 0.
  - For user resource groups, the permitted priority range
    is 0 to 19.
- Each group can be enabled or disabled, affording
  administrators control over thread assignment. Threads can
  be assigned only to enabled groups.

#### Resource Group Management

By default, there is one system group and one user group, named
`SYS_default` and
`USR_default`, respectively. These default
groups cannot be dropped and their attributes cannot be
modified. Each default group has no CPU affinity and priority 0.

Newly created system and user threads are assigned to the
`SYS_default` and
`USR_default` groups, respectively.

For user-defined resource groups, all attributes are assigned at
group creation time. After a group has been created, its
attributes can be modified, with the exception of the name and
type attributes.

To create and manage user-defined resource groups, use these SQL
statements:

- [`CREATE RESOURCE GROUP`](create-resource-group.md "15.7.2.2 CREATE RESOURCE GROUP Statement") creates
  a new group. See [Section 15.7.2.2, “CREATE RESOURCE GROUP Statement”](create-resource-group.md "15.7.2.2 CREATE RESOURCE GROUP Statement").
- [`ALTER RESOURCE GROUP`](alter-resource-group.md "15.7.2.1 ALTER RESOURCE GROUP Statement") modifies
  an existing group. See
  [Section 15.7.2.1, “ALTER RESOURCE GROUP Statement”](alter-resource-group.md "15.7.2.1 ALTER RESOURCE GROUP Statement").
- [`DROP RESOURCE GROUP`](drop-resource-group.md "15.7.2.3 DROP RESOURCE GROUP Statement") drops an
  existing group. See [Section 15.7.2.3, “DROP RESOURCE GROUP Statement”](drop-resource-group.md "15.7.2.3 DROP RESOURCE GROUP Statement").

Those statements require the
[`RESOURCE_GROUP_ADMIN`](privileges-provided.md#priv_resource-group-admin) privilege.

To manage resource group assignments, use these capabilities:

- [`SET RESOURCE GROUP`](set-resource-group.md "15.7.2.4 SET RESOURCE GROUP Statement") assigns
  threads to a group. See
  [Section 15.7.2.4, “SET RESOURCE GROUP Statement”](set-resource-group.md "15.7.2.4 SET RESOURCE GROUP Statement").
- The [`RESOURCE_GROUP`](optimizer-hints.md#optimizer-hints-resource-group "Resource Group Hint Syntax")
  optimizer hint assigns individual statements to a group. See
  [Section 10.9.3, “Optimizer Hints”](optimizer-hints.md "10.9.3 Optimizer Hints").

Those operations require the
[`RESOURCE_GROUP_ADMIN`](privileges-provided.md#priv_resource-group-admin) or
[`RESOURCE_GROUP_USER`](privileges-provided.md#priv_resource-group-user) privilege.

Resource group definitions are stored in the
`resource_groups` data dictionary table so that
groups persist across server restarts. Because
`resource_groups` is part of the data
dictionary, it is not directly accessible by users. Resource
group information is available using the Information Schema
[`RESOURCE_GROUPS`](information-schema-resource-groups-table.md "28.3.26 The INFORMATION_SCHEMA RESOURCE_GROUPS Table") table, which is
implemented as a view on the data dictionary table. See
[Section 28.3.26, “The INFORMATION\_SCHEMA RESOURCE\_GROUPS Table”](information-schema-resource-groups-table.md "28.3.26 The INFORMATION_SCHEMA RESOURCE_GROUPS Table").

Initially, the [`RESOURCE_GROUPS`](information-schema-resource-groups-table.md "28.3.26 The INFORMATION_SCHEMA RESOURCE_GROUPS Table")
table has these rows describing the default groups:

```sql
mysql> SELECT * FROM INFORMATION_SCHEMA.RESOURCE_GROUPS\G
*************************** 1. row ***************************
   RESOURCE_GROUP_NAME: USR_default
   RESOURCE_GROUP_TYPE: USER
RESOURCE_GROUP_ENABLED: 1
              VCPU_IDS: 0-3
       THREAD_PRIORITY: 0
*************************** 2. row ***************************
   RESOURCE_GROUP_NAME: SYS_default
   RESOURCE_GROUP_TYPE: SYSTEM
RESOURCE_GROUP_ENABLED: 1
              VCPU_IDS: 0-3
       THREAD_PRIORITY: 0
```

The `THREAD_PRIORITY` values are 0, indicating
the default priority. The `VCPU_IDS` values
show a range comprising all available CPUs. For the default
groups, the displayed value varies depending on the system on
which the MySQL server runs.

Earlier discussion mentioned a scenario involving a resource
group named `Batch` to manage execution of
batch jobs that need not execute with high priority. To create
such a group, use a statement similar to this:

```sql
CREATE RESOURCE GROUP Batch
  TYPE = USER
  VCPU = 2-3            -- assumes a system with at least 4 CPUs
  THREAD_PRIORITY = 10;
```

To verify that the resource group was created as expected, check
the [`RESOURCE_GROUPS`](information-schema-resource-groups-table.md "28.3.26 The INFORMATION_SCHEMA RESOURCE_GROUPS Table") table:

```sql
mysql> SELECT * FROM INFORMATION_SCHEMA.RESOURCE_GROUPS
       WHERE RESOURCE_GROUP_NAME = 'Batch'\G
*************************** 1. row ***************************
   RESOURCE_GROUP_NAME: Batch
   RESOURCE_GROUP_TYPE: USER
RESOURCE_GROUP_ENABLED: 1
              VCPU_IDS: 2-3
       THREAD_PRIORITY: 10
```

If the `THREAD_PRIORITY` value is 0 rather than
10, check whether your platform or system configuration limits
the resource group capability; see
[Resource Group Restrictions](resource-groups.md#resource-group-restrictions "Resource Group Restrictions").

To assign a thread to the `Batch` group, do
this:

```sql
SET RESOURCE GROUP Batch FOR thread_id;
```

Thereafter, statements in the named thread execute with
`Batch` group resources.

If a session's own current thread should be in the
`Batch` group, execute this statement within
the session:

```sql
SET RESOURCE GROUP Batch;
```

Thereafter, statements in the session execute with
`Batch` group resources.

To execute a single statement using the `Batch`
group, use the [`RESOURCE_GROUP`](optimizer-hints.md#optimizer-hints-resource-group "Resource Group Hint Syntax")
optimizer hint:

```sql
INSERT /*+ RESOURCE_GROUP(Batch) */ INTO t2 VALUES(2);
```

Threads assigned to the `Batch` group execute
with its resources, which can be modified as desired:

- For times when the system is highly loaded, decrease the
  number of CPUs assigned to the group, lower its priority, or
  (as shown) both:

  ```sql
  ALTER RESOURCE GROUP Batch
    VCPU = 3
    THREAD_PRIORITY = 19;
  ```
- For times when the system is lightly loaded, increase the
  number of CPUs assigned to the group, raise its priority, or
  (as shown) both:

  ```sql
  ALTER RESOURCE GROUP Batch
    VCPU = 0-3
    THREAD_PRIORITY = 0;
  ```

#### Resource Group Replication

Resource group management is local to the server on which it
occurs. Resource group SQL statements and modifications to the
`resource_groups` data dictionary table are not
written to the binary log and are not replicated.

#### Resource Group Restrictions

On some platforms or MySQL server configurations, resource
groups are unavailable or have limitations:

- Resource groups are unavailable if the thread pool plugin is
  installed.
- Resource groups are unavailable on macOS, which provides no
  API for binding CPUs to a thread.
- On FreeBSD and Solaris, resource group thread priorities are
  ignored. (Effectively, all threads run at priority 0.)
  Attempts to change priorities result in a warning:

  ```sql
  mysql> ALTER RESOURCE GROUP abc THREAD_PRIORITY = 10;
  Query OK, 0 rows affected, 1 warning (0.18 sec)

  mysql> SHOW WARNINGS;
  +---------+------+-------------------------------------------------------------+
  | Level   | Code | Message                                                     |
  +---------+------+-------------------------------------------------------------+
  | Warning | 4560 | Attribute thread_priority is ignored (using default value). |
  +---------+------+-------------------------------------------------------------+
  ```
- On Linux, resource groups thread priorities are ignored
  unless the `CAP_SYS_NICE` capability is
  set. Granting `CAP_SYS_NICE` capability to
  a process enables a range of privileges; consult
  <http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man7/capabilities.7.html>
  for the full list. Please be careful when enabling this
  capability.

  On Linux platforms using systemd and kernel support for
  Ambient Capabilities (Linux 4.3 or newer), the recommended
  way to enable `CAP_SYS_NICE` capability is
  to modify the MySQL service file and leave the
  [**mysqld**](mysqld.md "6.3.1 mysqld — The MySQL Server") binary unmodified. To adjust the
  service file for MySQL, use this procedure:

  1. Run the appropriate command for your platform:

     - Oracle Linux, Red Hat, and Fedora systems:

       ```terminal
       $> sudo systemctl edit mysqld
       ```
     - SUSE, Ubuntu, and Debian systems:

       ```terminal
       $> sudo systemctl edit mysql
       ```
  2. Using an editor, add the following text to the service
     file:

     ```ini
     [Service]
     AmbientCapabilities=CAP_SYS_NICE
     ```
  3. Restart the MySQL service.

  If you cannot enable the `CAP_SYS_NICE`
  capability as just described, it can be set manually using
  the **setcap** command, specifying the path
  name to the [**mysqld**](mysqld.md "6.3.1 mysqld — The MySQL Server") executable (this
  requires **sudo** access). You can check the
  capabilities using **getcap**. For example:

  ```terminal
  $> sudo setcap cap_sys_nice+ep /path/to/mysqld
  $> getcap /path/to/mysqld
  /path/to/mysqld = cap_sys_nice+ep
  ```

  As a safety measure, restrict execution of the
  [**mysqld**](mysqld.md "6.3.1 mysqld — The MySQL Server") binary to the
  `root` user and users with
  `mysql` group membership:

  ```terminal
  $> sudo chown root:mysql /path/to/mysqld
  $> sudo chmod 0750 /path/to/mysqld
  ```

  Important

  If manual use of **setcap** is required, it
  must be performed after each reinstall.
- On Windows, threads run at one of five thread priority
  levels. The resource group thread priority range of -20 to
  19 maps onto those levels as indicated in the following
  table.

  **Table 7.6 Resource Group Thread Priority on Windows**

  | Priority Range | Windows Priority Level |
  | --- | --- |
  | -20 to -10 | `THREAD_PRIORITY_HIGHEST` |
  | -9 to -1 | `THREAD_PRIORITY_ABOVE_NORMAL` |
  | 0 | `THREAD_PRIORITY_NORMAL` |
  | 1 to 10 | `THREAD_PRIORITY_BELOW_NORMAL` |
  | 11 to 19 | `THREAD_PRIORITY_LOWEST` |
