**Table 17.16 Online DDL Support for Index Operations**

| Operation | Instant | In Place | Rebuilds Table | Permits Concurrent DML | Only Modifies Metadata |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Creating or adding a secondary index | No | Yes | No | Yes | No |
| Dropping an index | No | Yes | No | Yes | Yes |
| Renaming an index | No | Yes | No | Yes | Yes |
| Adding a `FULLTEXT` index | No | Yes\* | No\* | No | No |
| Adding a `SPATIAL` index | No | Yes | No | No | No |
| Changing the index type | Yes | Yes | No | Yes | Yes |

##### Syntax and Usage Notes

- Creating or adding a secondary index

  ```sql
  CREATE INDEX name ON table (col_list);
  ```

  ```sql
  ALTER TABLE tbl_name ADD INDEX name (col_list);
  ```

  The table remains available for read and write operations
  while the index is being created. The
  [`CREATE INDEX`](create-index.md "15.1.15 CREATE INDEX Statement") statement only
  finishes after all transactions that are accessing the table
  are completed, so that the initial state of the index
  reflects the most recent contents of the table.

  Online DDL support for adding secondary indexes means that
  you can generally speed the overall process of creating and
  loading a table and associated indexes by creating the table
  without secondary indexes, then adding secondary indexes
  after the data is loaded.

  A newly created secondary index contains only the committed
  data in the table at the time the
  [`CREATE INDEX`](create-index.md "15.1.15 CREATE INDEX Statement") or
  [`ALTER TABLE`](alter-table.md "15.1.9 ALTER TABLE Statement") statement
  finishes executing. It does not contain any uncommitted
  values, old versions of values, or values marked for
  deletion but not yet removed from the old index.

  Some factors affect the performance, space usage, and
  semantics of this operation. For details, see
  [Section 17.12.8, “Online DDL Limitations”](innodb-online-ddl-limitations.md "17.12.8 Online DDL Limitations").
- Dropping an index

  ```sql
  DROP INDEX name ON table;
  ```

  ```sql
  ALTER TABLE tbl_name DROP INDEX name;
  ```

  The table remains available for read and write operations
  while the index is being dropped. The
  [`DROP INDEX`](drop-index.md "15.1.27 DROP INDEX Statement") statement only
  finishes after all transactions that are accessing the table
  are completed, so that the initial state of the index
  reflects the most recent contents of the table.
- Renaming an index

  ```sql
  ALTER TABLE tbl_name RENAME INDEX old_index_name TO new_index_name, ALGORITHM=INPLACE, LOCK=NONE;
  ```
- Adding a `FULLTEXT` index

  ```sql
  CREATE FULLTEXT INDEX name ON table(column);
  ```

  Adding the first `FULLTEXT` index rebuilds
  the table if there is no user-defined
  `FTS_DOC_ID` column. Additional
  `FULLTEXT` indexes may be added without
  rebuilding the table.
- Adding a `SPATIAL` index

  ```sql
  CREATE TABLE geom (g GEOMETRY NOT NULL);
  ALTER TABLE geom ADD SPATIAL INDEX(g), ALGORITHM=INPLACE, LOCK=SHARED;
  ```
- Changing the index type (`USING {BTREE |
  HASH}`)

  ```sql
  ALTER TABLE tbl_name DROP INDEX i1, ADD INDEX i1(key_part,...) USING BTREE, ALGORITHM=INSTANT;
  ```

#### Primary Key Operations

The following table provides an overview of online DDL support
for primary key operations. An asterisk indicates additional
information, an exception, or a dependency. See
[Syntax and Usage Notes](innodb-online-ddl-operations.md#online-ddl-primary-key-syntax-notes "Syntax and Usage Notes").

**Table 17.17 Online DDL Support for Primary Key Operations**

| Operation | Instant | In Place | Rebuilds Table | Permits Concurrent DML | Only Modifies Metadata |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Adding a primary key | No | Yes\* | Yes\* | Yes | No |
| Dropping a primary key | No | No | Yes | No | No |
| Dropping a primary key and adding another | No | Yes | Yes | Yes | No |

##### Syntax and Usage Notes

- Adding a primary key

  ```sql
  ALTER TABLE tbl_name ADD PRIMARY KEY (column), ALGORITHM=INPLACE, LOCK=NONE;
  ```

  Rebuilds the table in place. Data is reorganized
  substantially, making it an expensive operation.
  `ALGORITHM=INPLACE` is not permitted under
  certain conditions if columns have to be converted to
  `NOT NULL`.

  Restructuring the
  [clustered index](glossary.md#glos_clustered_index "clustered index")
  always requires copying of table data. Thus, it is best to
  define the [primary
  key](glossary.md#glos_primary_key "primary key") when you create a table, rather than issuing
  `ALTER TABLE ... ADD PRIMARY KEY` later.

  When you create a `UNIQUE` or
  `PRIMARY KEY` index, MySQL must do some
  extra work. For `UNIQUE` indexes, MySQL
  checks that the table contains no duplicate values for the
  key. For a `PRIMARY KEY` index, MySQL also
  checks that none of the `PRIMARY KEY`
  columns contains a `NULL`.

  When you add a primary key using the
  `ALGORITHM=COPY` clause, MySQL converts
  `NULL` values in the associated columns to
  default values: 0 for numbers, an empty string for
  character-based columns and BLOBs, and 0000-00-00 00:00:00
  for `DATETIME`. This is a non-standard
  behavior that Oracle recommends you not rely on. Adding a
  primary key using `ALGORITHM=INPLACE` is
  only permitted when the
  [`SQL_MODE`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_sql_mode) setting includes
  the `strict_trans_tables` or
  `strict_all_tables` flags; when the
  `SQL_MODE` setting is strict,
  `ALGORITHM=INPLACE` is permitted, but the
  statement can still fail if the requested primary key
  columns contain `NULL` values. The
  `ALGORITHM=INPLACE` behavior is more
  standard-compliant.

  If you create a table without a primary key,
  `InnoDB` chooses one for you, which can be
  the first `UNIQUE` key defined on
  `NOT NULL` columns, or a system-generated
  key. To avoid uncertainty and the potential space
  requirement for an extra hidden column, specify the
  `PRIMARY KEY` clause as part of the
  [`CREATE TABLE`](create-table.md "15.1.20 CREATE TABLE Statement") statement.

  MySQL creates a new clustered index by copying the existing
  data from the original table to a temporary table that has
  the desired index structure. Once the data is completely
  copied to the temporary table, the original table is renamed
  with a different temporary table name. The temporary table
  comprising the new clustered index is renamed with the name
  of the original table, and the original table is dropped
  from the database.

  The online performance enhancements that apply to operations
  on secondary indexes do not apply to the primary key index.
  The rows of an InnoDB table are stored in a
  [clustered index](glossary.md#glos_clustered_index "clustered index")
  organized based on the
  [primary key](glossary.md#glos_primary_key "primary key"), forming
  what some database systems call an “index-organized
  table”. Because the table structure is closely tied
  to the primary key, redefining the primary key still
  requires copying the data.

  When an operation on the primary key uses
  `ALGORITHM=INPLACE`, even though the data
  is still copied, it is more efficient than using
  `ALGORITHM=COPY` because:

  - No undo logging or associated redo logging is required
    for `ALGORITHM=INPLACE`. These
    operations add overhead to DDL statements that use
    `ALGORITHM=COPY`.
  - The secondary index entries are pre-sorted, and so can
    be loaded in order.
  - The change buffer is not used, because there are no
    random-access inserts into the secondary indexes.
- Dropping a primary key

  ```sql
  ALTER TABLE tbl_name DROP PRIMARY KEY, ALGORITHM=COPY;
  ```

  Only `ALGORITHM=COPY` supports dropping a
  primary key without adding a new one in the same
  `ALTER TABLE` statement.
- Dropping a primary key and adding another

  ```sql
  ALTER TABLE tbl_name DROP PRIMARY KEY, ADD PRIMARY KEY (column), ALGORITHM=INPLACE, LOCK=NONE;
  ```

  Data is reorganized substantially, making it an expensive
  operation.

#### Column Operations

The following table provides an overview of online DDL support
for column operations. An asterisk indicates additional
information, an exception, or a dependency. For details, see
[Syntax and Usage Notes](innodb-online-ddl-operations.md#online-ddl-column-syntax-notes "Syntax and Usage Notes").

**Table 17.18 Online DDL Support for Column Operations**

##### Syntax and Usage Notes

- Adding a column

  ```sql
  ALTER TABLE tbl_name ADD COLUMN column_name column_definition, ALGORITHM=INSTANT;
  ```

  `INSTANT` is the default algorithm as of
  MySQL 8.0.12, and `INPLACE` before that.

  The following limitations apply when the
  `INSTANT` algorithm adds a column:

  - A statement cannot combine the addition of a column with
    other `ALTER TABLE` actions that do not
    support the `INSTANT` algorithm.
  - The `INSTANT` algorithm can add a
    column at any position in the table. Before MySQL
    8.0.29, the `INSTANT` algorithm could
    only add a column as the last column of the table.
  - Columns cannot be added to tables that use
    `ROW_FORMAT=COMPRESSED`, tables with a
    `FULLTEXT` index, tables that reside in
    the data dictionary tablespace, or temporary tables.
    Temporary tables only support
    `ALGORITHM=COPY`.
  - MySQL checks the row size when the
    `INSTANT` algorithm adds a column, and
    throws the following error if the addition exceeds the
    limit.

    ERROR 4092 (HY000): Column can't be added
    with ALGORITHM=INSTANT as after this max possible row
    size crosses max permissible row size. Try
    ALGORITHM=INPLACE/COPY.

    Before MySQL 8.0.29, MySQL does not check the row size
    when the `INSTANT` algorithm adds a
    column. However, MySQL does check the row size during
    DML operations that insert and update rows in the table.
  - The maximum number of columns in the internal
    representation of the table cannot exceed 1022 after
    column addition with the `INSTANT`
    algorithm. The error message is:

    ERROR 4158 (HY000): Column can't be added to
    *`tbl_name`* with
    ALGORITHM=INSTANT anymore. Please try
    ALGORITHM=INPLACE/COPY
  - The `INSTANT` algorithm can not add or
    drop columns to system schema tables, such as the
    internal `mysql` table. This limitation
    was added in MySQL 8.0.29.
  - A column with a functional index cannot be dropped using
    the `INSTANT` algorithm.

  Multiple columns may be added in the same
  [`ALTER TABLE`](alter-table.md "15.1.9 ALTER TABLE Statement") statement. For
  example:

  ```sql
  ALTER TABLE t1 ADD COLUMN c2 INT, ADD COLUMN c3 INT, ALGORITHM=INSTANT;
  ```

  A new row version is created after each
  [`ALTER TABLE ...
  ALGORITHM=INSTANT`](alter-table.md "15.1.9 ALTER TABLE Statement") operation that adds one or more
  columns, drops one or more columns, or adds and drops one or
  more columns in the same operation. The
  `INFORMATION_SCHEMA.INNODB_TABLES.TOTAL_ROW_VERSIONS`
  column tracks the number of row versions for a table. The
  value is incremented each time a column is instantly added
  or dropped. The initial value is 0.

  ```sql
  mysql>  SELECT NAME, TOTAL_ROW_VERSIONS FROM INFORMATION_SCHEMA.INNODB_TABLES
          WHERE NAME LIKE 'test/t1';
  +---------+--------------------+
  | NAME    | TOTAL_ROW_VERSIONS |
  +---------+--------------------+
  | test/t1 |                  0 |
  +---------+--------------------+
  ```

  When a table with instantly added or dropped columns is
  rebuilt by table-rebuilding [`ALTER TABLE`](alter-table.md "15.1.9 ALTER TABLE Statement") or [`OPTIMIZE TABLE`](optimize-table.md "15.7.3.4 OPTIMIZE TABLE Statement")
  operation, the `TOTAL_ROW_VERSIONS` value
  is reset to 0. The maximum number of row versions permitted
  is 64, as each row version requires additional space for
  table metadata. When the row version limit is reached,
  `ADD COLUMN` and `DROP
  COLUMN` operations using
  `ALGORITHM=INSTANT` are rejected with an
  error message that recommends rebuilding the table using the
  `COPY` or `INPLACE`
  algorithm.

  ERROR 4092 (HY000): Maximum row versions reached
  for table test/t1. No more columns can be added or dropped
  instantly. Please use COPY/INPLACE.

  The following
  [`INFORMATION_SCHEMA`](information-schema.md "Chapter 28 INFORMATION_SCHEMA Tables") columns
  provide additional metadata for instantly added columns.
  Refer to the descriptions of those columns for more
  information. See
  [Section 28.4.9, “The INFORMATION\_SCHEMA INNODB\_COLUMNS Table”](information-schema-innodb-columns-table.md "28.4.9 The INFORMATION_SCHEMA INNODB_COLUMNS Table"),
  and
  [Section 28.4.23, “The INFORMATION\_SCHEMA INNODB\_TABLES Table”](information-schema-innodb-tables-table.md "28.4.23 The INFORMATION_SCHEMA INNODB_TABLES Table").

  - `INNODB_COLUMNS.DEFAULT_VALUE`
  - `INNODB_COLUMNS.HAS_DEFAULT`
  - `INNODB_TABLES.INSTANT_COLS`

  Concurrent DML is not permitted when adding an
  [auto-increment](glossary.md#glos_auto_increment "auto-increment")
  column. Data is reorganized substantially, making it an
  expensive operation. At a minimum,
  `ALGORITHM=INPLACE, LOCK=SHARED` is
  required.

  The table is rebuilt if `ALGORITHM=INPLACE`
  is used to add a column.
- Dropping a column

  ```sql
  ALTER TABLE tbl_name DROP COLUMN column_name, ALGORITHM=INSTANT;
  ```

  `INSTANT` is the default algorithm as of
  MySQL 8.0.29, and `INPLACE` before that.

  The following limitations apply when the
  `INSTANT` algorithm is used to drop a
  column:

  - Dropping a column cannot be combined in the same
    statement with other [`ALTER
    TABLE`](alter-table.md "15.1.9 ALTER TABLE Statement") actions that do not support
    `ALGORITHM=INSTANT`.
  - Columns cannot be dropped from tables that use
    `ROW_FORMAT=COMPRESSED`, tables with a
    `FULLTEXT` index, tables that reside in
    the data dictionary tablespace, or temporary tables.
    Temporary tables only support
    `ALGORITHM=COPY`.

  Multiple columns may be dropped in the same
  [`ALTER TABLE`](alter-table.md "15.1.9 ALTER TABLE Statement") statement; for
  example:

  ```sql
  ALTER TABLE t1 DROP COLUMN c4, DROP COLUMN c5, ALGORITHM=INSTANT;
  ```

  Each time a column is added or dropped using
  `ALGORITHM=INSTANT`, a new row version is
  created. The
  `INFORMATION_SCHEMA.INNODB_TABLES.TOTAL_ROW_VERSIONS`
  column tracks the number of row versions for a table. The
  value is incremented each time a column is instantly added
  or dropped. The initial value is 0.

  ```sql
  mysql>  SELECT NAME, TOTAL_ROW_VERSIONS FROM INFORMATION_SCHEMA.INNODB_TABLES
          WHERE NAME LIKE 'test/t1';
  +---------+--------------------+
  | NAME    | TOTAL_ROW_VERSIONS |
  +---------+--------------------+
  | test/t1 |                  0 |
  +---------+--------------------+
  ```

  When a table with instantly added or dropped columns is
  rebuilt by table-rebuilding [`ALTER TABLE`](alter-table.md "15.1.9 ALTER TABLE Statement") or [`OPTIMIZE TABLE`](optimize-table.md "15.7.3.4 OPTIMIZE TABLE Statement")
  operation, the `TOTAL_ROW_VERSIONS` value
  is reset to 0. The maximum number of row versions permitted
  is 64, as each row version requires additional space for
  table metadata. When the row version limit is reached,
  `ADD COLUMN` and `DROP
  COLUMN` operations using
  `ALGORITHM=INSTANT` are rejected with an
  error message that recommends rebuilding the table using the
  `COPY` or `INPLACE`
  algorithm.

  ERROR 4092 (HY000): Maximum row versions reached
  for table test/t1. No more columns can be added or dropped
  instantly. Please use COPY/INPLACE.

  If an algorithm other than
  `ALGORITHM=INSTANT` is used, data is
  reorganized substantially, making it an expensive operation.
- Renaming a column

  ```sql
  ALTER TABLE tbl CHANGE old_col_name new_col_name data_type, ALGORITHM=INSTANT;
  ```

  `ALGORITHM=INSTANT` support for renaming a
  column was added in MySQL 8.0.28. Earlier MySQL Server
  releases support only `ALGORITHM=INPLACE`
  and `ALGORITHM=COPY` when renaming a
  column.

  To permit concurrent DML, keep the same data type and only
  change the column name.

  When you keep the same data type and `[NOT]
  NULL` attribute, only changing the column name, the
  operation can always be performed online.

  Renaming a column referenced from another table is only
  permitted with `ALGORITHM=INPLACE`. If you
  use `ALGORITHM=INSTANT`,
  `ALGORITHM=COPY`, or some other condition
  that causes the operation to use those algorithms, the
  `ALTER TABLE` statement fails.

  `ALGORITHM=INSTANT` supports renaming a
  virtual column; `ALGORITHM=INPLACE` does
  not.

  `ALGORITHM=INSTANT` and
  `ALGORITHM=INPLACE` do not support renaming
  a column when adding or dropping a virtual column in the
  same statement. In this case, only
  `ALGORITHM=COPY` is supported.
- Reordering columns

  To reorder columns, use `FIRST` or
  `AFTER` in `CHANGE` or
  `MODIFY` operations.

  ```sql
  ALTER TABLE tbl_name MODIFY COLUMN col_name column_definition FIRST, ALGORITHM=INPLACE, LOCK=NONE;
  ```

  Data is reorganized substantially, making it an expensive
  operation.
- Changing the column data type

  ```sql
  ALTER TABLE tbl_name CHANGE c1 c1 BIGINT, ALGORITHM=COPY;
  ```

  Changing the column data type is only supported with
  `ALGORITHM=COPY`.
- Extending `VARCHAR` column size

  ```sql
  ALTER TABLE tbl_name CHANGE COLUMN c1 c1 VARCHAR(255), ALGORITHM=INPLACE, LOCK=NONE;
  ```

  The number of length bytes required by a
  [`VARCHAR`](char.md "13.3.2 The CHAR and VARCHAR Types") column must remain
  the same. For [`VARCHAR`](char.md "13.3.2 The CHAR and VARCHAR Types") columns
  of 0 to 255 bytes in size, one length byte is required to
  encode the value. For [`VARCHAR`](char.md "13.3.2 The CHAR and VARCHAR Types")
  columns of 256 bytes in size or more, two length bytes are
  required. As a result, in-place [`ALTER
  TABLE`](alter-table.md "15.1.9 ALTER TABLE Statement") only supports increasing
  [`VARCHAR`](char.md "13.3.2 The CHAR and VARCHAR Types") column size from 0 to
  255 bytes, or from 256 bytes to a greater size. In-place
  [`ALTER TABLE`](alter-table.md "15.1.9 ALTER TABLE Statement") does not support
  increasing the size of a
  [`VARCHAR`](char.md "13.3.2 The CHAR and VARCHAR Types") column from less than
  256 bytes to a size equal to or greater than 256 bytes. In
  this case, the number of required length bytes changes from
  1 to 2, which is only supported by a table copy
  (`ALGORITHM=COPY`). For example, attempting
  to change [`VARCHAR`](char.md "13.3.2 The CHAR and VARCHAR Types") column size
  for a single byte character set from VARCHAR(255) to
  VARCHAR(256) using in-place [`ALTER
  TABLE`](alter-table.md "15.1.9 ALTER TABLE Statement") returns this error:

  ```sql
  ALTER TABLE tbl_name ALGORITHM=INPLACE, CHANGE COLUMN c1 c1 VARCHAR(256);
  ERROR 0A000: ALGORITHM=INPLACE is not supported. Reason: Cannot change
  column type INPLACE. Try ALGORITHM=COPY.
  ```

  Note

  The byte length of a `VARCHAR` column is
  dependant on the byte length of the character set.

  Decreasing [`VARCHAR`](char.md "13.3.2 The CHAR and VARCHAR Types") size using
  in-place [`ALTER TABLE`](alter-table.md "15.1.9 ALTER TABLE Statement") is not
  supported. Decreasing [`VARCHAR`](char.md "13.3.2 The CHAR and VARCHAR Types")
  size requires a table copy
  (`ALGORITHM=COPY`).
- Setting a column default value

  ```sql
  ALTER TABLE tbl_name ALTER COLUMN col SET DEFAULT literal, ALGORITHM=INSTANT;
  ```

  Only modifies table metadata. Default column values are
  stored in the [data
  dictionary](glossary.md#glos_data_dictionary "data dictionary").
- Dropping a column default value

  ```sql
  ALTER TABLE tbl ALTER COLUMN col DROP DEFAULT, ALGORITHM=INSTANT;
  ```
- Changing the auto-increment value

  ```sql
  ALTER TABLE table AUTO_INCREMENT=next_value, ALGORITHM=INPLACE, LOCK=NONE;
  ```

  Modifies a value stored in memory, not the data file.

  In a distributed system using replication or sharding, you
  sometimes reset the auto-increment counter for a table to a
  specific value. The next row inserted into the table uses
  the specified value for its auto-increment column. You might
  also use this technique in a data warehousing environment
  where you periodically empty all the tables and reload them,
  and restart the auto-increment sequence from 1.
- Making a column `NULL`

  ```sql
  ALTER TABLE tbl_name MODIFY COLUMN column_name data_type NULL, ALGORITHM=INPLACE, LOCK=NONE;
  ```

  Rebuilds the table in place. Data is reorganized
  substantially, making it an expensive operation.
- Making a column `NOT NULL`

  ```sql
  ALTER TABLE tbl_name MODIFY COLUMN column_name data_type NOT NULL, ALGORITHM=INPLACE, LOCK=NONE;
  ```

  Rebuilds the table in place.
  `STRICT_ALL_TABLES` or
  `STRICT_TRANS_TABLES`
  [`SQL_MODE`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_sql_mode) is required for
  the operation to succeed. The operation fails if the column
  contains NULL values. The server prohibits changes to
  foreign key columns that have the potential to cause loss of
  referential integrity. See [Section 15.1.9, “ALTER TABLE Statement”](alter-table.md "15.1.9 ALTER TABLE Statement").
  Data is reorganized substantially, making it an expensive
  operation.
- Modifying the definition of an `ENUM` or
  `SET` column

  ```sql
  CREATE TABLE t1 (c1 ENUM('a', 'b', 'c'));
  ALTER TABLE t1 MODIFY COLUMN c1 ENUM('a', 'b', 'c', 'd'), ALGORITHM=INSTANT;
  ```

  Modifying the definition of an
  [`ENUM`](enum.md "13.3.5 The ENUM Type") or
  [`SET`](set.md "13.3.6 The SET Type") column by adding new
  enumeration or set members to the *end*
  of the list of valid member values may be performed
  instantly or in place, as long as the storage size of the
  data type does not change. For example, adding a member to a
  [`SET`](set.md "13.3.6 The SET Type") column that has 8 members
  changes the required storage per value from 1 byte to 2
  bytes; this requires a table copy. Adding members in the
  middle of the list causes renumbering of existing members,
  which requires a table copy.

#### Generated Column Operations

The following table provides an overview of online DDL support
for generated column operations. For details, see
[Syntax and Usage Notes](innodb-online-ddl-operations.md#online-ddl-generated-column-syntax-notes "Syntax and Usage Notes").

**Table 17.19 Online DDL Support for Generated Column Operations**

| Operation | Instant | In Place | Rebuilds Table | Permits Concurrent DML | Only Modifies Metadata |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Adding a `STORED` column | No | No | Yes | No | No |
| Modifying `STORED` column order | No | No | Yes | No | No |
| Dropping a `STORED` column | No | Yes | Yes | Yes | No |
| Adding a `VIRTUAL` column | Yes | Yes | No | Yes | Yes |
| Modifying `VIRTUAL` column order | No | No | Yes | No | No |
| Dropping a `VIRTUAL` column | Yes | Yes | No | Yes | Yes |

##### Syntax and Usage Notes

- Adding a `STORED` column

  ```sql
  ALTER TABLE t1 ADD COLUMN (c2 INT GENERATED ALWAYS AS (c1 + 1) STORED), ALGORITHM=COPY;
  ```

  `ADD COLUMN` is not an in-place operation
  for stored columns (done without using a temporary table)
  because the expression must be evaluated by the server.
- Modifying `STORED` column order

  ```sql
  ALTER TABLE t1 MODIFY COLUMN c2 INT GENERATED ALWAYS AS (c1 + 1) STORED FIRST, ALGORITHM=COPY;
  ```

  Rebuilds the table in place.
- Dropping a `STORED` column

  ```sql
  ALTER TABLE t1 DROP COLUMN c2, ALGORITHM=INPLACE, LOCK=NONE;
  ```

  Rebuilds the table in place.
- Adding a `VIRTUAL` column

  ```sql
  ALTER TABLE t1 ADD COLUMN (c2 INT GENERATED ALWAYS AS (c1 + 1) VIRTUAL), ALGORITHM=INSTANT;
  ```

  Adding a virtual column can be performed instantly or in
  place for non-partitioned tables.

  Adding a `VIRTUAL` is not an in-place
  operation for partitioned tables.
- Modifying `VIRTUAL` column order

  ```sql
  ALTER TABLE t1 MODIFY COLUMN c2 INT GENERATED ALWAYS AS (c1 + 1) VIRTUAL FIRST, ALGORITHM=COPY;
  ```
- Dropping a `VIRTUAL` column

  ```sql
  ALTER TABLE t1 DROP COLUMN c2, ALGORITHM=INSTANT;
  ```

  Dropping a `VIRTUAL` column can be
  performed instantly or in place for non-partitioned tables.

#### Foreign Key Operations

The following table provides an overview of online DDL support
for foreign key operations. An asterisk indicates additional
information, an exception, or a dependency. For details, see
[Syntax and Usage Notes](innodb-online-ddl-operations.md#online-ddl-foreign-key-syntax-notes "Syntax and Usage Notes").

**Table 17.20 Online DDL Support for Foreign Key Operations**

| Operation | Instant | In Place | Rebuilds Table | Permits Concurrent DML | Only Modifies Metadata |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Adding a foreign key constraint | No | Yes\* | No | Yes | Yes |
| Dropping a foreign key constraint | No | Yes | No | Yes | Yes |

##### Syntax and Usage Notes

- Adding a foreign key constraint

  The `INPLACE` algorithm is supported when
  [`foreign_key_checks`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_foreign_key_checks) is
  disabled. Otherwise, only the `COPY`
  algorithm is supported.

  ```sql
  ALTER TABLE tbl1 ADD CONSTRAINT fk_name FOREIGN KEY index (col1)
    REFERENCES tbl2(col2) referential_actions;
  ```
- Dropping a foreign key constraint

  ```sql
  ALTER TABLE tbl DROP FOREIGN KEY fk_name;
  ```

  Dropping a foreign key can be performed online with the
  [`foreign_key_checks`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_foreign_key_checks) option
  enabled or disabled.

  If you do not know the names of the foreign key constraints
  on a particular table, issue the following statement and
  find the constraint name in the
  `CONSTRAINT` clause for each foreign key:

  ```sql
  SHOW CREATE TABLE table\G
  ```

  Or, query the Information Schema
  [`TABLE_CONSTRAINTS`](information-schema-table-constraints-table.md "28.3.42 The INFORMATION_SCHEMA TABLE_CONSTRAINTS Table") table and use
  the `CONSTRAINT_NAME` and
  `CONSTRAINT_TYPE` columns to identify the
  foreign key names.

  You can also drop a foreign key and its associated index in
  a single statement:

  ```sql
  ALTER TABLE table DROP FOREIGN KEY constraint, DROP INDEX index;
  ```

Note

If [foreign keys](glossary.md#glos_foreign_key "foreign key") are
already present in the table being altered (that is, it is a
[child table](glossary.md#glos_child_table "child table") containing
a `FOREIGN KEY ... REFERENCE` clause),
additional restrictions apply to online DDL operations, even
those not directly involving the foreign key columns:

- An [`ALTER TABLE`](alter-table.md "15.1.9 ALTER TABLE Statement") on the child
  table could wait for another transaction to commit, if a
  change to the parent table causes associated changes in
  the child table through an `ON UPDATE` or
  `ON DELETE` clause using the
  `CASCADE` or `SET NULL`
  parameters.
- In the same way, if a table is the
  [parent table](glossary.md#glos_parent_table "parent table") in a
  foreign key relationship, even though it does not contain
  any `FOREIGN KEY` clauses, it could wait
  for the [`ALTER TABLE`](alter-table.md "15.1.9 ALTER TABLE Statement") to
  complete if an [`INSERT`](insert.md "15.2.7 INSERT Statement"),
  [`UPDATE`](update.md "15.2.17 UPDATE Statement"), or
  [`DELETE`](delete.md "15.2.2 DELETE Statement") statement causes an
  `ON UPDATE` or `ON
  DELETE` action in the child table.

#### Table Operations

The following table provides an overview of online DDL support
for table operations. An asterisk indicates additional
information, an exception, or a dependency. For details, see
[Syntax and Usage Notes](innodb-online-ddl-operations.md#online-ddl-table-syntax-notes "Syntax and Usage Notes").

**Table 17.21 Online DDL Support for Table Operations**

| Operation | Instant | In Place | Rebuilds Table | Permits Concurrent DML | Only Modifies Metadata |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Changing the `ROW_FORMAT` | No | Yes | Yes | Yes | No |
| Changing the `KEY_BLOCK_SIZE` | No | Yes | Yes | Yes | No |
| Setting persistent table statistics | No | Yes | No | Yes | Yes |
| Specifying a character set | No | Yes | Yes\* | Yes | No |
| Converting a character set | No | Yes | Yes\* | No | No |
| Optimizing a table | No | Yes\* | Yes | Yes | No |
| Rebuilding with the `FORCE` option | No | Yes\* | Yes | Yes | No |
| Performing a null rebuild | No | Yes\* | Yes | Yes | No |
| Renaming a table | Yes | Yes | No | Yes | Yes |

##### Syntax and Usage Notes

- Changing the `ROW_FORMAT`

  ```sql
  ALTER TABLE tbl_name ROW_FORMAT = row_format, ALGORITHM=INPLACE, LOCK=NONE;
  ```

  Data is reorganized substantially, making it an expensive
  operation.

  For additional information about the
  `ROW_FORMAT` option, see
  [Table Options](create-table.md#create-table-options "Table Options").
- Changing the `KEY_BLOCK_SIZE`

  ```sql
  ALTER TABLE tbl_name KEY_BLOCK_SIZE = value, ALGORITHM=INPLACE, LOCK=NONE;
  ```

  Data is reorganized substantially, making it an expensive
  operation.

  For additional information about the
  `KEY_BLOCK_SIZE` option, see
  [Table Options](create-table.md#create-table-options "Table Options").
- Setting persistent table statistics options

  ```sql
  ALTER TABLE tbl_name STATS_PERSISTENT=0, STATS_SAMPLE_PAGES=20, STATS_AUTO_RECALC=1, ALGORITHM=INPLACE, LOCK=NONE;
  ```

  Only modifies table metadata.

  Persistent statistics include
  `STATS_PERSISTENT`,
  `STATS_AUTO_RECALC`, and
  `STATS_SAMPLE_PAGES`. For more information,
  see [Section 17.8.10.1, “Configuring Persistent Optimizer Statistics Parameters”](innodb-persistent-stats.md "17.8.10.1 Configuring Persistent Optimizer Statistics Parameters").
- Specifying a character set

  ```sql
  ALTER TABLE tbl_name CHARACTER SET = charset_name, ALGORITHM=INPLACE, LOCK=NONE;
  ```

  Rebuilds the table if the new character encoding is
  different.
- Converting a character set

  ```sql
  ALTER TABLE tbl_name CONVERT TO CHARACTER SET charset_name, ALGORITHM=INPLACE, LOCK=NONE;
  ```

  Rebuilds the table if the new character encoding is
  different.
- Optimizing a table

  ```sql
  OPTIMIZE TABLE tbl_name;
  ```

  In-place operation is not supported for tables with
  `FULLTEXT` indexes. The operation uses the
  `INPLACE` algorithm, but
  `ALGORITHM` and `LOCK`
  syntax is not permitted.
- Rebuilding a table with the `FORCE` option

  ```sql
  ALTER TABLE tbl_name FORCE, ALGORITHM=INPLACE, LOCK=NONE;
  ```

  Uses `ALGORITHM=INPLACE` as of MySQL
  5.6.17. `ALGORITHM=INPLACE` is
  not supported for tables with `FULLTEXT`
  indexes.
- Performing a "null" rebuild

  ```sql
  ALTER TABLE tbl_name ENGINE=InnoDB, ALGORITHM=INPLACE, LOCK=NONE;
  ```

  Uses `ALGORITHM=INPLACE` as of MySQL
  5.6.17. `ALGORITHM=INPLACE` is not
  supported for tables with `FULLTEXT`
  indexes.
- Renaming a table

  ```sql
  ALTER TABLE old_tbl_name RENAME TO new_tbl_name, ALGORITHM=INSTANT;
  ```

  Renaming a table can be performed instantly or in place.
  MySQL renames files that correspond to the table
  *`tbl_name`* without making a copy.
  (You can also use the [`RENAME
  TABLE`](rename-table.md "15.1.36 RENAME TABLE Statement") statement to rename tables. See
  [Section 15.1.36, “RENAME TABLE Statement”](rename-table.md "15.1.36 RENAME TABLE Statement").) Privileges granted
  specifically for the renamed table are not migrated to the
  new name. They must be changed manually.

#### Tablespace Operations

The following table provides an overview of online DDL support
for tablespace operations. For details, see
[Syntax and Usage Notes](innodb-online-ddl-operations.md#online-ddl-tablespace-syntax-notes "Syntax and Usage Notes").

**Table 17.22 Online DDL Support for Tablespace Operations**

| Operation | Instant | In Place | Rebuilds Table | Permits Concurrent DML | Only Modifies Metadata |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Renaming a general tablespace | No | Yes | No | Yes | Yes |
| Enabling or disabling general tablespace encryption | No | Yes | No | Yes | No |
| Enabling or disabling file-per-table tablespace encryption | No | No | Yes | No | No |

##### Syntax and Usage Notes

- Renaming a general tablespace

  ```sql
  ALTER TABLESPACE tablespace_name RENAME TO new_tablespace_name;
  ```

  [`ALTER
  TABLESPACE ... RENAME TO`](alter-tablespace.md "15.1.10 ALTER TABLESPACE Statement") uses the
  `INPLACE` algorithm but does not support
  the `ALGORITHM` clause.
- Enabling or disabling general tablespace encryption

  ```sql
  ALTER TABLESPACE tablespace_name ENCRYPTION='Y';
  ```

  [`ALTER
  TABLESPACE ... ENCRYPTION`](alter-tablespace.md "15.1.10 ALTER TABLESPACE Statement") uses the
  `INPLACE` algorithm but does not support
  the `ALGORITHM` clause.

  For related information, see
  [Section 17.13, “InnoDB Data-at-Rest Encryption”](innodb-data-encryption.md "17.13 InnoDB Data-at-Rest Encryption").
- Enabling or disabling file-per-table tablespace encryption

  ```sql
  ALTER TABLE tbl_name ENCRYPTION='Y', ALGORITHM=COPY;
  ```

  For related information, see
  [Section 17.13, “InnoDB Data-at-Rest Encryption”](innodb-data-encryption.md "17.13 InnoDB Data-at-Rest Encryption").

#### Partitioning Operations

With the exception of some [`ALTER
TABLE`](alter-table.md "15.1.9 ALTER TABLE Statement") partitioning clauses, online DDL operations for
partitioned `InnoDB` tables follow the same
rules that apply to regular `InnoDB` tables.

Some [`ALTER TABLE`](alter-table.md "15.1.9 ALTER TABLE Statement") partitioning
clauses do not go through the same internal online DDL API as
regular non-partitioned `InnoDB` tables. As a
result, online support for [`ALTER
TABLE`](alter-table.md "15.1.9 ALTER TABLE Statement") partitioning clauses varies.

The following table shows the online status for each
`ALTER TABLE` partitioning statement.
Regardless of the online DDL API that is used, MySQL attempts to
minimize data copying and locking where possible.

[`ALTER TABLE`](alter-table.md "15.1.9 ALTER TABLE Statement") partitioning options
that use `ALGORITHM=COPY` or that only permit
“`ALGORITHM=DEFAULT,
LOCK=DEFAULT`”, repartition the table using the
`COPY` algorithm. In other words, a new
partitioned table is created with the new partitioning scheme.
The newly created table includes any changes applied by the
[`ALTER TABLE`](alter-table.md "15.1.9 ALTER TABLE Statement") statement, and table
data is copied into the new table structure.

**Table 17.23 Online DDL Support for Partitioning Operations**

| Partitioning Clause | Instant | In Place | Permits DML | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| [`PARTITION BY`](alter-table.md "15.1.9 ALTER TABLE Statement") | No | No | No | Permits `ALGORITHM=COPY`, `LOCK={DEFAULT|SHARED|EXCLUSIVE}` |
| [`ADD PARTITION`](alter-table.md "15.1.9 ALTER TABLE Statement") | No | Yes\* | Yes\* | `ALGORITHM=INPLACE, LOCK={DEFAULT|NONE|SHARED|EXCLUSISVE}` is supported for `RANGE` and `LIST` partitions, `ALGORITHM=INPLACE, LOCK={DEFAULT|SHARED|EXCLUSISVE}` for `HASH` and `KEY` partitions, and `ALGORITHM=COPY, LOCK={SHARED|EXCLUSIVE}` for all partition types. Does not copy existing data for tables partitioned by `RANGE` or `LIST`. Concurrent queries are permitted with `ALGORITHM=COPY` for tables partitioned by `HASH` or `LIST`, as MySQL copies the data while holding a shared lock. |
| [`DROP PARTITION`](alter-table.md "15.1.9 ALTER TABLE Statement") | No | Yes\* | Yes\* | `ALGORITHM=INPLACE, LOCK={DEFAULT|NONE|SHARED|EXCLUSIVE}` is supported. Does not copy data for tables partitioned by `RANGE` or `LIST`.  `DROP PARTITION` with `ALGORITHM=INPLACE` deletes data stored in the partition and drops the partition. However, `DROP PARTITION` with `ALGORITHM=COPY` or [`old_alter_table=ON`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_old_alter_table) rebuilds the partitioned table and attempts to move data from the dropped partition to another partition with a compatible `PARTITION ... VALUES` definition. Data that cannot be moved to another partition is deleted. |
| [`DISCARD PARTITION`](alter-table.md "15.1.9 ALTER TABLE Statement") | No | No | No | Only permits `ALGORITHM=DEFAULT`, `LOCK=DEFAULT` |
| [`IMPORT PARTITION`](alter-table.md "15.1.9 ALTER TABLE Statement") | No | No | No | Only permits `ALGORITHM=DEFAULT`, `LOCK=DEFAULT` |
| [`TRUNCATE PARTITION`](alter-table.md "15.1.9 ALTER TABLE Statement") | No | Yes | Yes | Does not copy existing data. It merely deletes rows; it does not alter the definition of the table itself, or of any of its partitions. |
| [`COALESCE PARTITION`](alter-table.md "15.1.9 ALTER TABLE Statement") | No | Yes\* | No | `ALGORITHM=INPLACE, LOCK={DEFAULT|SHARED|EXCLUSIVE}` is supported. |
| [`REORGANIZE PARTITION`](alter-table.md "15.1.9 ALTER TABLE Statement") | No | Yes\* | No | `ALGORITHM=INPLACE, LOCK={DEFAULT|SHARED|EXCLUSIVE}` is supported. |
| [`EXCHANGE PARTITION`](alter-table.md "15.1.9 ALTER TABLE Statement") | No | Yes | Yes |  |
| [`ANALYZE PARTITION`](alter-table.md "15.1.9 ALTER TABLE Statement") | No | Yes | Yes |  |
| [`CHECK PARTITION`](alter-table.md "15.1.9 ALTER TABLE Statement") | No | Yes | Yes |  |
| [`OPTIMIZE PARTITION`](alter-table.md "15.1.9 ALTER TABLE Statement") | No | No | No | `ALGORITHM` and `LOCK` clauses are ignored. Rebuilds the entire table. See [Section 26.3.4, “Maintenance of Partitions”](partitioning-maintenance.md "26.3.4 Maintenance of Partitions"). |
| [`REBUILD PARTITION`](alter-table.md "15.1.9 ALTER TABLE Statement") | No | Yes\* | No | `ALGORITHM=INPLACE, LOCK={DEFAULT|SHARED|EXCLUSIVE}` is supported. |
| [`REPAIR PARTITION`](alter-table.md "15.1.9 ALTER TABLE Statement") | No | Yes | Yes |  |
| [`REMOVE PARTITIONING`](alter-table.md "15.1.9 ALTER TABLE Statement") | No | No | No | Permits `ALGORITHM=COPY`, `LOCK={DEFAULT|SHARED|EXCLUSIVE}` |

Non-partitioning online [`ALTER
TABLE`](alter-table.md "15.1.9 ALTER TABLE Statement") operations on partitioned tables follow the same
rules that apply to regular tables. However,
[`ALTER TABLE`](alter-table.md "15.1.9 ALTER TABLE Statement") performs online
operations on each table partition, which causes increased
demand on system resources due to operations being performed on
multiple partitions.

For additional information about [`ALTER
TABLE`](alter-table.md "15.1.9 ALTER TABLE Statement") partitioning clauses, see
[Partitioning Options](alter-table.md#alter-table-partition-options "Partitioning Options"), and
[Section 15.1.9.1, “ALTER TABLE Partition Operations”](alter-table-partition-operations.md "15.1.9.1 ALTER TABLE Partition Operations"). For
information about partitioning in general, see
[Chapter 26, *Partitioning*](partitioning.md "Chapter 26 Partitioning").
