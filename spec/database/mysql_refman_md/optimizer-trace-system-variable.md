### 10.15.8 The optimizer\_trace System Variable

The optimizer\_trace system variable has these on/off switches:

- `enabled`: Enables (`ON`) or
  disables (`OFF`) tracing
- `one_line`: If set to `ON`,
  the trace contains no whitespace, thus conserving space. This
  renders the trace difficult to read for humans, still usable
  by JSON parsers, since they ignore whitespace.
