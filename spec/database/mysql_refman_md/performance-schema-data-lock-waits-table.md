#### 29.12.13.2 The data\_lock\_waits Table

The [`data_lock_waits`](performance-schema-data-lock-waits-table.md "29.12.13.2 The data_lock_waits Table") table
implements a many-to-many relationship showing which data lock
requests in the [`data_locks`](performance-schema-data-locks-table.md "29.12.13.1 The data_locks Table") table
are blocked by which held data locks in the
[`data_locks`](performance-schema-data-locks-table.md "29.12.13.1 The data_locks Table") table. Held locks in
[`data_locks`](performance-schema-data-locks-table.md "29.12.13.1 The data_locks Table") appear in
[`data_lock_waits`](performance-schema-data-lock-waits-table.md "29.12.13.2 The data_lock_waits Table") only if they
block some lock request.

This information enables you to understand data lock
dependencies between sessions. The table exposes not only
which lock a session or transaction is waiting for, but which
session or transaction currently holds that lock.

Example data lock wait information:

```sql
mysql> SELECT * FROM performance_schema.data_lock_waits\G
*************************** 1. row ***************************
                          ENGINE: INNODB
       REQUESTING_ENGINE_LOCK_ID: 140211201964816:2:4:2:140211086465800
REQUESTING_ENGINE_TRANSACTION_ID: 1555
            REQUESTING_THREAD_ID: 47
             REQUESTING_EVENT_ID: 5
REQUESTING_OBJECT_INSTANCE_BEGIN: 140211086465800
         BLOCKING_ENGINE_LOCK_ID: 140211201963888:2:4:2:140211086459880
  BLOCKING_ENGINE_TRANSACTION_ID: 1554
              BLOCKING_THREAD_ID: 46
               BLOCKING_EVENT_ID: 12
  BLOCKING_OBJECT_INSTANCE_BEGIN: 140211086459880
```

Unlike most Performance Schema data collection, there are no
instruments for controlling whether data lock information is
collected or system variables for controlling data lock table
sizes. The Performance Schema collects information that is
already available in the server, so there is no memory or CPU
overhead to generate this information or need for parameters
that control its collection.

Use the [`data_lock_waits`](performance-schema-data-lock-waits-table.md "29.12.13.2 The data_lock_waits Table") table to
help diagnose performance problems that occur during times of
heavy concurrent load. For `InnoDB`, see the
discussion of this topic at
[Section 17.15.2, “InnoDB INFORMATION\_SCHEMA Transaction and Locking Information”](innodb-information-schema-transactions.md "17.15.2 InnoDB INFORMATION_SCHEMA Transaction and Locking Information").

Because the columns in the
[`data_lock_waits`](performance-schema-data-lock-waits-table.md "29.12.13.2 The data_lock_waits Table") table are similar
to those in the [`data_locks`](performance-schema-data-locks-table.md "29.12.13.1 The data_locks Table") table,
the column descriptions here are abbreviated. For more
detailed column descriptions, see
[Section 29.12.13.1, “The data\_locks Table”](performance-schema-data-locks-table.md "29.12.13.1 The data_locks Table").

The [`data_lock_waits`](performance-schema-data-lock-waits-table.md "29.12.13.2 The data_lock_waits Table") table has
these columns:

- `ENGINE`

  The storage engine that requested the lock.
- `REQUESTING_ENGINE_LOCK_ID`

  The ID of the lock requested by the storage engine. To
  obtain details about the lock, join this column with the
  `ENGINE_LOCK_ID` column of the
  [`data_locks`](performance-schema-data-locks-table.md "29.12.13.1 The data_locks Table") table.
- `REQUESTING_ENGINE_TRANSACTION_ID`

  The storage engine internal ID of the transaction that
  requested the lock.
- `REQUESTING_THREAD_ID`

  The thread ID of the session that requested the lock.
- `REQUESTING_EVENT_ID`

  The Performance Schema event that caused the lock request
  in the session that requested the lock.
- `REQUESTING_OBJECT_INSTANCE_BEGIN`

  The address in memory of the requested lock.
- `BLOCKING_ENGINE_LOCK_ID`

  The ID of the blocking lock. To obtain details about the
  lock, join this column with the
  `ENGINE_LOCK_ID` column of the
  [`data_locks`](performance-schema-data-locks-table.md "29.12.13.1 The data_locks Table") table.
- `BLOCKING_ENGINE_TRANSACTION_ID`

  The storage engine internal ID of the transaction that
  holds the blocking lock.
- `BLOCKING_THREAD_ID`

  The thread ID of the session that holds the blocking lock.
- `BLOCKING_EVENT_ID`

  The Performance Schema event that caused the blocking lock
  in the session that holds it.
- `BLOCKING_OBJECT_INSTANCE_BEGIN`

  The address in memory of the blocking lock.

The [`data_lock_waits`](performance-schema-data-lock-waits-table.md "29.12.13.2 The data_lock_waits Table") table has
these indexes:

- Index on (`REQUESTING_ENGINE_LOCK_ID`,
  `ENGINE`)
- Index on (`BLOCKING_ENGINE_LOCK_ID`,
  `ENGINE`)
- Index on
  (`REQUESTING_ENGINE_TRANSACTION_ID`,
  `ENGINE`)
- Index on
  (`BLOCKING_ENGINE_TRANSACTION_ID`,
  `ENGINE`)
- Index on (`REQUESTING_THREAD_ID`,
  `REQUESTING_EVENT_ID`)
- Index on (`BLOCKING_THREAD_ID`,
  `BLOCKING_EVENT_ID`)

[`TRUNCATE TABLE`](truncate-table.md "15.1.37 TRUNCATE TABLE Statement") is not permitted
for the [`data_lock_waits`](performance-schema-data-lock-waits-table.md "29.12.13.2 The data_lock_waits Table") table.

Note

Prior to MySQL 8.0.1, information similar to that in the
Performance Schema
[`data_lock_waits`](performance-schema-data-lock-waits-table.md "29.12.13.2 The data_lock_waits Table") table is
available in the
`INFORMATION_SCHEMA.INNODB_LOCK_WAITS`
table, which provides information about each blocked
`InnoDB` transaction, indicating the lock
it has requested and any locks that are blocking that
request.
`INFORMATION_SCHEMA.INNODB_LOCK_WAITS` is
deprecated and is removed as of MySQL 8.0.1.
[`data_lock_waits`](performance-schema-data-lock-waits-table.md "29.12.13.2 The data_lock_waits Table") should be used
instead.

The tables differ in the privileges required: The
`INNODB_LOCK_WAITS` table requires the global
[`PROCESS`](privileges-provided.md#priv_process) privilege. The
[`data_lock_waits`](performance-schema-data-lock-waits-table.md "29.12.13.2 The data_lock_waits Table") table requires
the usual Performance Schema privilege of
[`SELECT`](privileges-provided.md#priv_select) on the table to be
selected from.

The following table shows the mapping from
`INNODB_LOCK_WAITS` columns to
[`data_lock_waits`](performance-schema-data-lock-waits-table.md "29.12.13.2 The data_lock_waits Table") columns. Use this
information to migrate applications from one table to the
other.

**Table 29.5 Mapping from INNODB\_LOCK\_WAITS to data\_lock\_waits Columns**
