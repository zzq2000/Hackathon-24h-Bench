### 9.5.1 Point-in-Time Recovery Using Binary Log

This section explains the general idea of using the binary log
to perform a point-in-time-recovery. The next section,
[Section 9.5.2, “Point-in-Time Recovery Using Event Positions”](point-in-time-recovery-positions.md "9.5.2 Point-in-Time Recovery Using Event Positions"), explains the
operation in details with an example.

Note

Many of the examples in this and the next section use the
[**mysql**](mysql.md "6.5.1 mysql — The MySQL Command-Line Client") client to process binary log output
produced by [**mysqlbinlog**](mysqlbinlog.md "6.6.9 mysqlbinlog — Utility for Processing Binary Log Files"). If your binary log
contains `\0` (null) characters, that output
cannot be parsed by [**mysql**](mysql.md "6.5.1 mysql — The MySQL Command-Line Client") unless you invoke
it with the [`--binary-mode`](mysql-command-options.md#option_mysql_binary-mode)
option.

The source of information for point-in-time recovery is the set
of binary log files generated subsequent to the full backup
operation. Therefore, to allow a server to be restored to a
point-in-time, binary logging must be enabled on it, which is
the default setting for MySQL 8.0
(see [Section 7.4.4, “The Binary Log”](binary-log.md "7.4.4 The Binary Log")).

To restore data from the binary log, you must know the name and
location of the current binary log files. By default, the server
creates binary log files in the data directory, but a path name
can be specified with the
[`--log-bin`](replication-options-binary-log.md#option_mysqld_log-bin) option to place the
files in a different location. To see a listing of all binary
log files, use this statement:

```sql
mysql> SHOW BINARY LOGS;
```

To determine the name of the current binary log file, issue the
following statement:

```sql
mysql> SHOW MASTER STATUS;
```

The [**mysqlbinlog**](mysqlbinlog.md "6.6.9 mysqlbinlog — Utility for Processing Binary Log Files") utility converts the events
in the binary log files from binary format to text so that they
can be viewed or applied. [**mysqlbinlog**](mysqlbinlog.md "6.6.9 mysqlbinlog — Utility for Processing Binary Log Files") has
options for selecting sections of the binary log based on event
times or position of events within the log. See
[Section 6.6.9, “mysqlbinlog — Utility for Processing Binary Log Files”](mysqlbinlog.md "6.6.9 mysqlbinlog — Utility for Processing Binary Log Files").

Applying events from the binary log causes the data
modifications they represent to be reexecuted. This enables
recovery of data changes for a given span of time. To apply
events from the binary log, process
[**mysqlbinlog**](mysqlbinlog.md "6.6.9 mysqlbinlog — Utility for Processing Binary Log Files") output using the
[**mysql**](mysql.md "6.5.1 mysql — The MySQL Command-Line Client") client:

```terminal
$> mysqlbinlog binlog_files | mysql -u root -p
```

If binary log files have been encrypted, which can be done from
MySQL 8.0.14 onwards, [**mysqlbinlog**](mysqlbinlog.md "6.6.9 mysqlbinlog — Utility for Processing Binary Log Files") cannot read
them directly as in the above example, but can read them from
the server using the
[`--read-from-remote-server`](mysqlbinlog.md#option_mysqlbinlog_read-from-remote-server)
(`-R`) option. For example:

```terminal
$> mysqlbinlog --read-from-remote-server --host=host_name --port=3306  --user=root --password --ssl-mode=required  binlog_files | mysql -u root -p
```

Here, the option `--ssl-mode=required` has been
used to ensure that the data from the binary log files is
protected in transit, because it is sent to
[**mysqlbinlog**](mysqlbinlog.md "6.6.9 mysqlbinlog — Utility for Processing Binary Log Files") in an unencrypted format.

Important

`VERIFY_CA` and
`VERIFY_IDENTITY` are better choices than
`REQUIRED` for the SSL mode, because they
help prevent man-in-the-middle attacks. To implement one of
these settings, you must first ensure that the CA certificate
for the server is reliably available to all the clients that
use it in your environment, otherwise availability issues will
result. See [Command Options for Encrypted Connections](connection-options.md#encrypted-connection-options "Command Options for Encrypted Connections").

Viewing log contents can be useful when you need to determine
event times or positions to select partial log contents prior to
executing events. To view events from the log, send
[**mysqlbinlog**](mysqlbinlog.md "6.6.9 mysqlbinlog — Utility for Processing Binary Log Files") output into a paging program:

```terminal
$> mysqlbinlog binlog_files | more
```

Alternatively, save the output in a file and view the file in a
text editor:

```terminal
$> mysqlbinlog binlog_files > tmpfile
$> ... edit tmpfile ...
```

After editing the file, apply the contents as follows:

```terminal
$> mysql -u root -p < tmpfile
```

If you have more than one binary log to apply on the MySQL
server, use a single connection to apply the contents of all
binary log files that you want to process. Here is one way to do
so:

```terminal
$> mysqlbinlog binlog.000001 binlog.000002 | mysql -u root -p
```

Another approach is to write the whole log to a single file and
then process the file:

```terminal
$> mysqlbinlog binlog.000001 >  /tmp/statements.sql
$> mysqlbinlog binlog.000002 >> /tmp/statements.sql
$> mysql -u root -p -e "source /tmp/statements.sql"
```
