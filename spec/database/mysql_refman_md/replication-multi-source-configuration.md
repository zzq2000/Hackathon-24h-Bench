#### 19.1.5.1 Configuring Multi-Source Replication

A multi-source replication topology requires at least two sources
and one replica configured. In these tutorials, we assume that you
have two sources `source1` and
`source2`, and a replica
`replicahost`. The replica replicates one
database from each of the sources, `db1` from
`source1` and `db2` from
`source2`.

Sources in a multi-source replication topology can be configured
to use either GTID-based replication, or binary log position-based
replication. See [Section 19.1.3.4, “Setting Up Replication Using GTIDs”](replication-gtids-howto.md "19.1.3.4 Setting Up Replication Using GTIDs") for how
to configure a source using GTID-based replication. See
[Section 19.1.2.1, “Setting the Replication Source Configuration”](replication-howto-masterbaseconfig.md "19.1.2.1 Setting the Replication Source Configuration") for how to
configure a source using file position based replication.

Replicas in a multi-source replication topology require
`TABLE` repositories for the replica's connection
metadata repository and applier metadata repository, which are the
default in MySQL 8.0. Multi-source replication is not
compatible with the deprecated alternative file repositories.

Create a suitable user account on all the sources that the replica
can use to connect. You can use the same account on all the
sources, or a different account on each. If you create an account
solely for the purposes of replication, that account needs only
the [`REPLICATION SLAVE`](privileges-provided.md#priv_replication-slave) privilege.
For example, to set up a new user, `ted`, that
can connect from the replica `replicahost`, use
the [**mysql**](mysql.md "6.5.1 mysql — The MySQL Command-Line Client") client to issue these statements on
each of the sources:

```sql
mysql> CREATE USER 'ted'@'replicahost' IDENTIFIED BY 'password';
mysql> GRANT REPLICATION SLAVE ON *.* TO 'ted'@'replicahost';
```

For more details, and important information on the default
authentication plugin for new users from MySQL 8.0, see
[Section 19.1.2.3, “Creating a User for Replication”](replication-howto-repuser.md "19.1.2.3 Creating a User for Replication").
