### 25.3.3 Initial Configuration of NDB Cluster

In this section, we discuss manual configuration of an installed
NDB Cluster by creating and editing configuration files.

For our four-node, four-host NDB Cluster (see
[Cluster nodes and host computers](mysql-cluster-installation.md#mysql-cluster-install-nodes-hosts "Cluster nodes and host computers")), it is
necessary to write four configuration files, one per node host.

- Each data node or SQL node requires a
  `my.cnf` file that provides two pieces of
  information: a connection
  string that tells the node where to find the
  management node, and a line telling the MySQL server on this
  host (the machine hosting the data node) to enable the
  [`NDBCLUSTER`](mysql-cluster.md "Chapter 25 MySQL NDB Cluster 8.0") storage engine.

  For more information on connection strings, see
  [Section 25.4.3.3, “NDB Cluster Connection Strings”](mysql-cluster-connection-strings.md "25.4.3.3 NDB Cluster Connection Strings").
- The management node needs a `config.ini`
  file telling it how many fragment replicas to maintain, how
  much memory to allocate for data and indexes on each data
  node, where to find the data nodes, where to save data to disk
  on each data node, and where to find any SQL nodes.

**Configuring the data nodes and SQL nodes.**
The `my.cnf` file needed for the data nodes
is fairly simple. The configuration file should be located in
the `/etc` directory and can be edited using
any text editor. (Create the file if it does not exist.) For
example:

```terminal
$> vi /etc/my.cnf
```

Note

We show **vi** being used here to create the
file, but any text editor should work just as well.

For each data node and SQL node in our example setup,
`my.cnf` should look like this:

```ini
[mysqld]
# Options for mysqld process:
ndbcluster                      # run NDB storage engine

[mysql_cluster]
# Options for NDB Cluster processes:
ndb-connectstring=198.51.100.10  # location of management server
```

After entering the preceding information, save this file and exit
the text editor. Do this for the machines hosting data node
“A”, data node “B”, and the SQL node.

Important

Once you have started a [**mysqld**](mysqld.md "6.3.1 mysqld — The MySQL Server") process with
the `ndbcluster` and
`ndb-connectstring` parameters in the
`[mysqld]` and
`[mysql_cluster]` sections of the
`my.cnf` file as shown previously, you cannot
execute any [`CREATE TABLE`](create-table.md "15.1.20 CREATE TABLE Statement") or
[`ALTER TABLE`](alter-table.md "15.1.9 ALTER TABLE Statement") statements without
having actually started the cluster. Otherwise, these statements
fail with an error. This is by design.

**Configuring the management node.**
The first step in configuring the management node is to create
the directory in which the configuration file can be found and
then to create the file itself. For example (running as
`root`):

```terminal
$> mkdir /var/lib/mysql-cluster
$> cd /var/lib/mysql-cluster
$> vi config.ini
```

For our representative setup, the `config.ini`
file should read as follows:

```ini
[ndbd default]
# Options affecting ndbd processes on all data nodes:
NoOfReplicas=2    # Number of fragment replicas
DataMemory=98M    # How much memory to allocate for data storage

[ndb_mgmd]
# Management process options:
HostName=198.51.100.10          # Hostname or IP address of management node
DataDir=/var/lib/mysql-cluster  # Directory for management node log files

[ndbd]
# Options for data node "A":
                                # (one [ndbd] section per data node)
HostName=198.51.100.30          # Hostname or IP address
NodeId=2                        # Node ID for this data node
DataDir=/usr/local/mysql/data   # Directory for this data node's data files

[ndbd]
# Options for data node "B":
HostName=198.51.100.40          # Hostname or IP address
NodeId=3                        # Node ID for this data node
DataDir=/usr/local/mysql/data   # Directory for this data node's data files

[mysqld]
# SQL node options:
HostName=198.51.100.20          # Hostname or IP address
                                # (additional mysqld connections can be
                                # specified for this node for various
                                # purposes such as running ndb_restore)
```

After all the configuration files have been created and these
minimal options have been specified, you are ready to proceed with
starting the cluster and verifying that all processes are running.
We discuss how this is done in
[Section 25.3.4, “Initial Startup of NDB Cluster”](mysql-cluster-install-first-start.md "25.3.4 Initial Startup of NDB Cluster").

For more detailed information about the available NDB Cluster
configuration parameters and their uses, see
[Section 25.4.3, “NDB Cluster Configuration Files”](mysql-cluster-config-file.md "25.4.3 NDB Cluster Configuration Files"), and
[Section 25.4, “Configuration of NDB Cluster”](mysql-cluster-configuration.md "25.4 Configuration of NDB Cluster"). For configuration
of NDB Cluster as relates to making backups, see
[Section 25.6.8.3, “Configuration for NDB Cluster Backups”](mysql-cluster-backup-configuration.md "25.6.8.3 Configuration for NDB Cluster Backups").

The default port for Cluster management nodes is 1186. For data
nodes, the cluster can automatically allocate ports from those
that are already free.
