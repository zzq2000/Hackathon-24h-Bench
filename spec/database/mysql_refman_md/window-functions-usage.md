### 14.20.2 Window Function Concepts and Syntax

This section describes how to use window functions. Examples use
the same sales information data set as found in the discussion
of the [`GROUPING()`](miscellaneous-functions.md#function_grouping) function in
[Section 14.19.2, “GROUP BY Modifiers”](group-by-modifiers.md "14.19.2 GROUP BY Modifiers"):

```sql
mysql> SELECT * FROM sales ORDER BY country, year, product;
+------+---------+------------+--------+
| year | country | product    | profit |
+------+---------+------------+--------+
| 2000 | Finland | Computer   |   1500 |
| 2000 | Finland | Phone      |    100 |
| 2001 | Finland | Phone      |     10 |
| 2000 | India   | Calculator |     75 |
| 2000 | India   | Calculator |     75 |
| 2000 | India   | Computer   |   1200 |
| 2000 | USA     | Calculator |     75 |
| 2000 | USA     | Computer   |   1500 |
| 2001 | USA     | Calculator |     50 |
| 2001 | USA     | Computer   |   1500 |
| 2001 | USA     | Computer   |   1200 |
| 2001 | USA     | TV         |    150 |
| 2001 | USA     | TV         |    100 |
+------+---------+------------+--------+
```

A window function performs an aggregate-like operation on a set
of query rows. However, whereas an aggregate operation groups
query rows into a single result row, a window function produces
a result for each query row:

- The row for which function evaluation occurs is called the
  current row.
- The query rows related to the current row over which
  function evaluation occurs comprise the window for the
  current row.

For example, using the sales information table, these two
queries perform aggregate operations that produce a single
global sum for all rows taken as a group, and sums grouped per
country:

```sql
mysql> SELECT SUM(profit) AS total_profit
       FROM sales;
+--------------+
| total_profit |
+--------------+
|         7535 |
+--------------+
mysql> SELECT country, SUM(profit) AS country_profit
       FROM sales
       GROUP BY country
       ORDER BY country;
+---------+----------------+
| country | country_profit |
+---------+----------------+
| Finland |           1610 |
| India   |           1350 |
| USA     |           4575 |
+---------+----------------+
```

By contrast, window operations do not collapse groups of query
rows to a single output row. Instead, they produce a result for
each row. Like the preceding queries, the following query uses
[`SUM()`](aggregate-functions.md#function_sum), but this time as a window
function:

```sql
mysql> SELECT
         year, country, product, profit,
         SUM(profit) OVER() AS total_profit,
         SUM(profit) OVER(PARTITION BY country) AS country_profit
       FROM sales
       ORDER BY country, year, product, profit;
+------+---------+------------+--------+--------------+----------------+
| year | country | product    | profit | total_profit | country_profit |
+------+---------+------------+--------+--------------+----------------+
| 2000 | Finland | Computer   |   1500 |         7535 |           1610 |
| 2000 | Finland | Phone      |    100 |         7535 |           1610 |
| 2001 | Finland | Phone      |     10 |         7535 |           1610 |
| 2000 | India   | Calculator |     75 |         7535 |           1350 |
| 2000 | India   | Calculator |     75 |         7535 |           1350 |
| 2000 | India   | Computer   |   1200 |         7535 |           1350 |
| 2000 | USA     | Calculator |     75 |         7535 |           4575 |
| 2000 | USA     | Computer   |   1500 |         7535 |           4575 |
| 2001 | USA     | Calculator |     50 |         7535 |           4575 |
| 2001 | USA     | Computer   |   1200 |         7535 |           4575 |
| 2001 | USA     | Computer   |   1500 |         7535 |           4575 |
| 2001 | USA     | TV         |    100 |         7535 |           4575 |
| 2001 | USA     | TV         |    150 |         7535 |           4575 |
+------+---------+------------+--------+--------------+----------------+
```

Each window operation in the query is signified by inclusion of
an `OVER` clause that specifies how to
partition query rows into groups for processing by the window
function:

- The first `OVER` clause is empty, which
  treats the entire set of query rows as a single partition.
  The window function thus produces a global sum, but does so
  for each row.
- The second `OVER` clause partitions rows by
  country, producing a sum per partition (per country). The
  function produces this sum for each partition row.

Window functions are permitted only in the select list and
`ORDER BY` clause. Query result rows are
determined from the `FROM` clause, after
`WHERE`, `GROUP BY`, and
`HAVING` processing, and windowing execution
occurs before `ORDER BY`,
`LIMIT`, and `SELECT
DISTINCT`.

The `OVER` clause is permitted for many
aggregate functions, which therefore can be used as window or
nonwindow functions, depending on whether the
`OVER` clause is present or absent:

```sql
AVG()
BIT_AND()
BIT_OR()
BIT_XOR()
COUNT()
JSON_ARRAYAGG()
JSON_OBJECTAGG()
MAX()
MIN()
STDDEV_POP(), STDDEV(), STD()
STDDEV_SAMP()
SUM()
VAR_POP(), VARIANCE()
VAR_SAMP()
```

For details about each aggregate function, see
[Section 14.19.1, “Aggregate Function Descriptions”](aggregate-functions.md "14.19.1 Aggregate Function Descriptions").

MySQL also supports nonaggregate functions that are used only as
window functions. For these, the `OVER` clause
is mandatory:

```sql
CUME_DIST()
DENSE_RANK()
FIRST_VALUE()
LAG()
LAST_VALUE()
LEAD()
NTH_VALUE()
NTILE()
PERCENT_RANK()
RANK()
ROW_NUMBER()
```

For details about each nonaggregate function, see
[Section 14.20.1, “Window Function Descriptions”](window-function-descriptions.md "14.20.1 Window Function Descriptions").

As an example of one of those nonaggregate window functions,
this query uses [`ROW_NUMBER()`](window-function-descriptions.md#function_row-number),
which produces the row number of each row within its partition.
In this case, rows are numbered per country. By default,
partition rows are unordered and row numbering is
nondeterministic. To sort partition rows, include an
`ORDER BY` clause within the window definition.
The query uses unordered and ordered partitions (the
`row_num1` and `row_num2`
columns) to illustrate the difference between omitting and
including `ORDER BY`:

```sql
mysql> SELECT
         year, country, product, profit,
         ROW_NUMBER() OVER(PARTITION BY country) AS row_num1,
         ROW_NUMBER() OVER(PARTITION BY country ORDER BY year, product) AS row_num2
       FROM sales;
+------+---------+------------+--------+----------+----------+
| year | country | product    | profit | row_num1 | row_num2 |
+------+---------+------------+--------+----------+----------+
| 2000 | Finland | Computer   |   1500 |        2 |        1 |
| 2000 | Finland | Phone      |    100 |        1 |        2 |
| 2001 | Finland | Phone      |     10 |        3 |        3 |
| 2000 | India   | Calculator |     75 |        2 |        1 |
| 2000 | India   | Calculator |     75 |        3 |        2 |
| 2000 | India   | Computer   |   1200 |        1 |        3 |
| 2000 | USA     | Calculator |     75 |        5 |        1 |
| 2000 | USA     | Computer   |   1500 |        4 |        2 |
| 2001 | USA     | Calculator |     50 |        2 |        3 |
| 2001 | USA     | Computer   |   1500 |        3 |        4 |
| 2001 | USA     | Computer   |   1200 |        7 |        5 |
| 2001 | USA     | TV         |    150 |        1 |        6 |
| 2001 | USA     | TV         |    100 |        6 |        7 |
+------+---------+------------+--------+----------+----------+
```

As mentioned previously, to use a window function (or treat an
aggregate function as a window function), include an
`OVER` clause following the function call. The
`OVER` clause has two forms:

```sql
over_clause:
    {OVER (window_spec) | OVER window_name}
```

Both forms define how the window function should process query
rows. They differ in whether the window is defined directly in
the `OVER` clause, or supplied by a reference
to a named window defined elsewhere in the query:

- In the first case, the window specification appears directly
  in the `OVER` clause, between the
  parentheses.
- In the second case, *`window_name`*
  is the name for a window specification defined by a
  `WINDOW` clause elsewhere in the query. For
  details, see
  [Section 14.20.4, “Named Windows”](window-functions-named-windows.md "14.20.4 Named Windows").

For `OVER
(window_spec)` syntax, the
window specification has several parts, all optional:

```sql
window_spec:
    [window_name] [partition_clause] [order_clause] [frame_clause]
```

If `OVER()` is empty, the window consists of
all query rows and the window function computes a result using
all rows. Otherwise, the clauses present within the parentheses
determine which query rows are used to compute the function
result and how they are partitioned and ordered:

- *`window_name`*: The name of a window
  defined by a `WINDOW` clause elsewhere in
  the query. If *`window_name`* appears
  by itself within the `OVER` clause, it
  completely defines the window. If partitioning, ordering, or
  framing clauses are also given, they modify interpretation
  of the named window. For details, see
  [Section 14.20.4, “Named Windows”](window-functions-named-windows.md "14.20.4 Named Windows").
- *`partition_clause`*: A
  `PARTITION BY` clause indicates how to
  divide the query rows into groups. The window function
  result for a given row is based on the rows of the partition
  that contains the row. If `PARTITION BY` is
  omitted, there is a single partition consisting of all query
  rows.

  Note

  Partitioning for window functions differs from table
  partitioning. For information about table partitioning,
  see [Chapter 26, *Partitioning*](partitioning.md "Chapter 26 Partitioning").

  *`partition_clause`* has this syntax:

  ```sql
  partition_clause:
      PARTITION BY expr [, expr] ...
  ```

  Standard SQL requires `PARTITION BY` to be
  followed by column names only. A MySQL extension is to
  permit expressions, not just column names. For example, if a
  table contains a [`TIMESTAMP`](datetime.md "13.2.2 The DATE, DATETIME, and TIMESTAMP Types")
  column named `ts`, standard SQL permits
  `PARTITION BY ts` but not
  `PARTITION BY HOUR(ts)`, whereas MySQL
  permits both.
- *`order_clause`*: An `ORDER
  BY` clause indicates how to sort rows in each
  partition. Partition rows that are equal according to the
  `ORDER BY` clause are considered peers. If
  `ORDER BY` is omitted, partition rows are
  unordered, with no processing order implied, and all
  partition rows are peers.

  *`order_clause`* has this syntax:

  ```sql
  order_clause:
      ORDER BY expr [ASC|DESC] [, expr [ASC|DESC]] ...
  ```

  Each `ORDER BY` expression optionally can
  be followed by `ASC` or
  `DESC` to indicate sort direction. The
  default is `ASC` if no direction is
  specified. `NULL` values sort first for
  ascending sorts, last for descending sorts.

  An `ORDER BY` in a window definition
  applies within individual partitions. To sort the result set
  as a whole, include an `ORDER BY` at the
  query top level.
- *`frame_clause`*: A frame is a subset
  of the current partition and the frame clause specifies how
  to define the subset. The frame clause has many subclauses
  of its own. For details, see
  [Section 14.20.3, “Window Function Frame Specification”](window-functions-frames.md "14.20.3 Window Function Frame Specification").
