## 29.2 Performance Schema Build Configuration

The Performance Schema is mandatory and always compiled in. It is
possible to exclude certain parts of the Performance Schema
instrumentation. For example, to exclude stage and statement
instrumentation, do this:

```terminal
$> cmake . \
        -DDISABLE_PSI_STAGE=1 \
        -DDISABLE_PSI_STATEMENT=1
```

For more information, see the descriptions of the
`DISABLE_PSI_XXX`
**CMake** options in
[Section 2.8.7, “MySQL Source-Configuration Options”](source-configuration-options.md "2.8.7 MySQL Source-Configuration Options").

If you install MySQL over a previous installation that was
configured without the Performance Schema (or with an older
version of the Performance Schema that has missing or out-of-date
tables). One indication of this issue is the presence of messages
such as the following in the error log:

```none
[ERROR] Native table 'performance_schema'.'events_waits_history'
has the wrong structure
[ERROR] Native table 'performance_schema'.'events_waits_history_long'
has the wrong structure
...
```

To correct that problem, perform the MySQL upgrade procedure. See
[Chapter 3, *Upgrading MySQL*](upgrading.md "Chapter 3 Upgrading MySQL").

Because the Performance Schema is configured into the server at
build time, a row for
[`PERFORMANCE_SCHEMA`](performance-schema.md "Chapter 29 MySQL Performance Schema") appears in the
output from [`SHOW ENGINES`](show-engines.md "15.7.7.16 SHOW ENGINES Statement"). This
means that the Performance Schema is available, not that it is
enabled. To enable it, you must do so at server startup, as
described in the next section.
