## 17.4 InnoDB Architecture

The following diagram shows in-memory and on-disk structures that
comprise the `InnoDB` storage engine
architecture. For information about each structure, see
[Section 17.5, “InnoDB In-Memory Structures”](innodb-in-memory-structures.md "17.5 InnoDB In-Memory Structures"), and
[Section 17.6, “InnoDB On-Disk Structures”](innodb-on-disk-structures.md "17.6 InnoDB On-Disk Structures").
