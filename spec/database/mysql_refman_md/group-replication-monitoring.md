## 20.4 Monitoring Group Replication

[20.4.1 GTIDs and Group Replication](group-replication-gtids.md)

[20.4.2 Group Replication Server States](group-replication-server-states.md)

[20.4.3 The replication\_group\_members Table](group-replication-replication-group-members.md)

[20.4.4 The replication\_group\_member\_stats Table](group-replication-replication-group-member-stats.md)

You can use the MySQL [Performance
Schema](performance-schema.md "Chapter 29 MySQL Performance Schema") to monitor Group Replication. These Performance Schema
tables display information specific to Group Replication:

- [`replication_group_member_stats`](performance-schema-replication-group-member-stats-table.md "29.12.11.15 The replication_group_member_stats Table"): See
  [Section 20.4.4, “The replication\_group\_member\_stats Table”](group-replication-replication-group-member-stats.md "20.4.4 The replication_group_member_stats Table").
- [`replication_group_members`](performance-schema-replication-group-members-table.md "29.12.11.16 The replication_group_members Table"): See
  [Section 20.4.3, “The replication\_group\_members Table”](group-replication-replication-group-members.md "20.4.3 The replication_group_members Table").
- [`replication_group_communication_information`](performance-schema-replication-group-communication-information-table.md "29.12.11.12 The replication_group_communication_information Table"):
  See
  [Section 29.12.11.12, “The replication\_group\_communication\_information Table”](performance-schema-replication-group-communication-information-table.md "29.12.11.12 The replication_group_communication_information Table").

These Performance Schema replication tables also show information
relating to Group Replication:

- [`replication_connection_status`](performance-schema-replication-connection-status-table.md "29.12.11.11 The replication_connection_status Table") shows
  information regarding Group Replication, such as transactions
  received from the group and queued in the applier queue (relay
  log).
- [`replication_applier_status`](performance-schema-replication-applier-status-table.md "29.12.11.3 The replication_applier_status Table") shows
  the states of channels and threads relating to Group
  Replication. These can also be used to monitor what individual
  worker threads are doing.

Replication channels created by the Group Replication plugin are
listed here:

- `group_replication_recovery`: Used for
  replication changes related to distributed recovery.
- `group_replication_applier`: Used for the
  incoming changes from the group, to apply transactions coming
  directly from the group.

For information about system variables affecting Group Replication,
see [Section 20.9.1, “Group Replication System Variables”](group-replication-system-variables.md "20.9.1 Group Replication System Variables"). See
[Section 20.9.2, “Group Replication Status Variables”](group-replication-status-variables.md "20.9.2 Group Replication Status Variables"), for status
variables providing information about Group Replication.

Beginning with MySQL 8.0.21, messages relating to Group Replication
lifecycle events other than errors are classified as system
messages; these are always written to the replication group
member' error log. You can use this information to review the
history of a given server's membership in a replication group.
(Previously, such events were classified as information messages;
for a MySQL server from a release prior to 8.0.21, these can be
added to the error log by setting
[`log_error_verbosity`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_log_error_verbosity) to
`3`.)

Some lifecycle events that affect the whole group are logged on
every group member, such as a new member entering
`ONLINE` status in the group or a primary election.
Other events are logged only on the member where they take place,
such as super read only mode being enabled or disabled on the
member, or the member leaving the group. A number of lifecycle
events that can indicate an issue if they occur frequently are
logged as warning messages, including a member becoming unreachable
and then reachable again, and a member starting distributed recovery
by state transfer from the binary log or by a remote cloning
operation.

Note

If you are monitoring one or more secondary instances using
[**mysqladmin**](mysqladmin.md "6.5.2 mysqladmin — A MySQL Server Administration Program"), you should be aware that a
[`FLUSH STATUS`](flush.md#flush-status) statement executed by
this utility creates a GTID event on the local instance which may
impact future group operations.
