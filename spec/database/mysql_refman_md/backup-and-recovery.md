It is important to back up your databases so that you can recover
your data and be up and running again in case problems occur, such
as system crashes, hardware failures, or users deleting data by
mistake. Backups are also essential as a safeguard before upgrading
a MySQL installation, and they can be used to transfer a MySQL
installation to another system or to set up replica servers.

MySQL offers a variety of backup strategies from which you can
choose the methods that best suit the requirements for your
installation. This chapter discusses several backup and recovery
topics with which you should be familiar:

- Types of backups: Logical versus physical, full versus
  incremental, and so forth.
- Methods for creating backups.
- Recovery methods, including point-in-time recovery.
- Backup scheduling, compression, and encryption.
- Table maintenance, to enable recovery of corrupt tables.

## Additional Resources

Resources related to backup or to maintaining data availability
include the following:

- Customers of MySQL Enterprise Edition can use the MySQL Enterprise Backup product for backups. For an
  overview of the MySQL Enterprise Backup product, see
  [Section 32.1, “MySQL Enterprise Backup Overview”](mysql-enterprise-backup.md "32.1 MySQL Enterprise Backup Overview").
- A forum dedicated to backup issues is available at
  <https://forums.mysql.com/list.php?28>.
- Details for [**mysqldump**](mysqldump.md "6.5.4 mysqldump — A Database Backup Program") can be found in
  [Chapter 6, *MySQL Programs*](programs.md "Chapter 6 MySQL Programs").
- The syntax of the SQL statements described here is given in
  [Chapter 15, *SQL Statements*](sql-statements.md "Chapter 15 SQL Statements").
- For additional information about `InnoDB`
  backup procedures, see [Section 17.18.1, “InnoDB Backup”](innodb-backup.md "17.18.1 InnoDB Backup").
- Replication enables you to maintain identical data on multiple
  servers. This has several benefits, such as enabling client
  query load to be distributed over servers, availability of data
  even if a given server is taken offline or fails, and the
  ability to make backups with no impact on the source by using a
  replica. See [Chapter 19, *Replication*](replication.md "Chapter 19 Replication").
- MySQL InnoDB Cluster is a collection of products that work
  together to provide a high availability solution. A group of
  MySQL servers can be configured to create a cluster using
  MySQL Shell. The cluster of servers has a single source, called
  the primary, which acts as the read-write source. Multiple
  secondary servers are replicas of the source. A minimum of three
  servers are required to create a high availability cluster. A
  client application is connected to the primary via MySQL Router. If
  the primary fails, a secondary is automatically promoted to the
  role of primary, and MySQL Router routes requests to the new
  primary.
- NDB Cluster provides a high-availability, high-redundancy
  version of MySQL adapted for the distributed computing
  environment. See [Chapter 25, *MySQL NDB Cluster 8.0*](mysql-cluster.md "Chapter 25 MySQL NDB Cluster 8.0"), which provides
  information about MySQL NDB Cluster 8.0.
