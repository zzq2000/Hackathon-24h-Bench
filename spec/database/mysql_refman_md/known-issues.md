### B.3.7 Known Issues in MySQL

This section lists known issues in recent versions of MySQL.

For information about platform-specific issues, see the
installation and debugging instructions in
[Section 2.1, “General Installation Guidance”](general-installation-issues.md "2.1 General Installation Guidance"), and
[Section 7.9, “Debugging MySQL”](debugging-mysql.md "7.9 Debugging MySQL").

The following problems are known:

- Subquery optimization for `IN` is not as
  effective as for `=`.
- Even if you use `lower_case_table_names=2`
  (which enables MySQL to remember the case used for databases
  and table names), MySQL does not remember the case used for
  database names for the function
  [`DATABASE()`](information-functions.md#function_database) or within the
  various logs (on case-insensitive systems).
- Dropping a `FOREIGN KEY` constraint does
  not work in replication because the constraint may have
  another name on the replica.
- [`REPLACE`](replace.md "15.2.12 REPLACE Statement") (and
  [`LOAD DATA`](load-data.md "15.2.9 LOAD DATA Statement") with the
  [`REPLACE`](replace.md "15.2.12 REPLACE Statement") option) does not
  trigger `ON DELETE CASCADE`.
- `DISTINCT` with `ORDER BY`
  does not work inside
  [`GROUP_CONCAT()`](aggregate-functions.md#function_group-concat) if you do not
  use all and only those columns that are in the
  `DISTINCT` list.
- When inserting a big integer value (between
  263 and
  264−1) into a decimal or
  string column, it is inserted as a negative value because
  the number is evaluated in signed integer context.
- With statement-based binary logging, the source server
  writes the executed queries to the binary log. This is a
  very fast, compact, and efficient logging method that works
  perfectly in most cases. However, it is possible for the
  data on the source and replica to become different if a
  query is designed in such a way that the data modification
  is nondeterministic (generally not a recommended practice,
  even outside of replication).

  For example:

  - [`CREATE
    TABLE ... SELECT`](create-table-select.md "15.1.20.4 CREATE TABLE ... SELECT Statement") or
    [`INSERT
    ... SELECT`](insert-select.md "15.2.7.1 INSERT ... SELECT Statement") statements that insert zero or
    `NULL` values into an
    `AUTO_INCREMENT` column.
  - [`DELETE`](delete.md "15.2.2 DELETE Statement") if you are
    deleting rows from a table that has foreign keys with
    `ON DELETE CASCADE` properties.
  - [`REPLACE ...
    SELECT`](replace.md "15.2.12 REPLACE Statement"), `INSERT IGNORE ...
    SELECT` if you have duplicate key values in the
    inserted data.

  **If and only if the preceding queries
  have no `ORDER BY` clause guaranteeing a
  deterministic order**.

  For example, for
  [`INSERT ...
  SELECT`](insert-select.md "15.2.7.1 INSERT ... SELECT Statement") with no `ORDER BY`, the
  [`SELECT`](select.md "15.2.13 SELECT Statement") may return rows in a
  different order (which results in a row having different
  ranks, hence getting a different number in the
  `AUTO_INCREMENT` column), depending on the
  choices made by the optimizers on the source and replica.

  A query is optimized differently on the source and replica
  only if:

  - The table is stored using a different storage engine on
    the source than on the replica. (It is possible to use
    different storage engines on the source and replica. For
    example, you can use `InnoDB` on the
    source, but `MyISAM` on the replica if
    the replica has less available disk space.)
  - MySQL buffer sizes
    ([`key_buffer_size`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_key_buffer_size), and
    so on) are different on the source and replica.
  - The source and replica run different MySQL versions, and
    the optimizer code differs between these versions.

  This problem may also affect database restoration using
  **mysqlbinlog|mysql**.

  The easiest way to avoid this problem is to add an
  `ORDER BY` clause to the aforementioned
  nondeterministic queries to ensure that the rows are always
  stored or modified in the same order. Using row-based or
  mixed logging format also avoids the problem.
- Log file names are based on the server host name if you do
  not specify a file name with the startup option. To retain
  the same log file names if you change your host name to
  something else, you must explicitly use options such as
  [`--log-bin=old_host_name-bin`](replication-options-binary-log.md#option_mysqld_log-bin).
  See [Section 7.1.7, “Server Command Options”](server-options.md "7.1.7 Server Command Options"). Alternatively, rename
  the old files to reflect your host name change. If these are
  binary logs, you must edit the binary log index file and fix
  the binary log file names there as well. (The same is true
  for the relay logs on a replica.)
- [**mysqlbinlog**](mysqlbinlog.md "6.6.9 mysqlbinlog — Utility for Processing Binary Log Files") does not delete temporary
  files left after a [`LOAD DATA`](load-data.md "15.2.9 LOAD DATA Statement")
  statement. See [Section 6.6.9, “mysqlbinlog — Utility for Processing Binary Log Files”](mysqlbinlog.md "6.6.9 mysqlbinlog — Utility for Processing Binary Log Files").
- `RENAME` does not work with
  `TEMPORARY` tables or tables used in a
  `MERGE` table.
- When using `SET CHARACTER SET`, you cannot
  use translated characters in database, table, and column
  names.
- Prior to MySQL 8.0.17, you cannot use `_`
  or `%` with `ESCAPE` in
  [`LIKE ...
  ESCAPE`](string-comparison-functions.md#operator_like).
- The server uses only the first
  [`max_sort_length`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_max_sort_length) bytes when
  comparing data values. This means that values cannot
  reliably be used in `GROUP BY`,
  `ORDER BY`, or `DISTINCT`
  if they differ only after the first
  [`max_sort_length`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_max_sort_length) bytes. To
  work around this, increase the variable value. The default
  value of [`max_sort_length`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_max_sort_length) is
  1024 and can be changed at server startup time or at
  runtime.
- Numeric calculations are done with
  [`BIGINT`](integer-types.md "13.1.2 Integer Types (Exact Value) - INTEGER, INT, SMALLINT, TINYINT, MEDIUMINT, BIGINT") or
  [`DOUBLE`](floating-point-types.md "13.1.4 Floating-Point Types (Approximate Value) - FLOAT, DOUBLE") (both are normally 64
  bits long). Which precision you get depends on the function.
  The general rule is that bit functions are performed with
  [`BIGINT`](integer-types.md "13.1.2 Integer Types (Exact Value) - INTEGER, INT, SMALLINT, TINYINT, MEDIUMINT, BIGINT") precision,
  [`IF()`](flow-control-functions.md#function_if) and
  [`ELT()`](string-functions.md#function_elt) with
  [`BIGINT`](integer-types.md "13.1.2 Integer Types (Exact Value) - INTEGER, INT, SMALLINT, TINYINT, MEDIUMINT, BIGINT") or
  [`DOUBLE`](floating-point-types.md "13.1.4 Floating-Point Types (Approximate Value) - FLOAT, DOUBLE") precision, and the
  rest with [`DOUBLE`](floating-point-types.md "13.1.4 Floating-Point Types (Approximate Value) - FLOAT, DOUBLE") precision.
  You should try to avoid using unsigned long long values if
  they resolve to be larger than 63 bits (9223372036854775807)
  for anything other than bit fields.
- You can have up to 255 [`ENUM`](enum.md "13.3.5 The ENUM Type")
  and [`SET`](set.md "13.3.6 The SET Type") columns in one table.
- In [`MIN()`](aggregate-functions.md#function_min),
  [`MAX()`](aggregate-functions.md#function_max), and other aggregate
  functions, MySQL currently compares
  [`ENUM`](enum.md "13.3.5 The ENUM Type") and
  [`SET`](set.md "13.3.6 The SET Type") columns by their string
  value rather than by the string's relative position in the
  set.
- In an [`UPDATE`](update.md "15.2.17 UPDATE Statement") statement,
  columns are updated from left to right. If you refer to an
  updated column, you get the updated value instead of the
  original value. For example, the following statement
  increments `KEY` by `2`,
  **not** `1`:

  ```sql
  mysql> UPDATE tbl_name SET KEY=KEY+1,KEY=KEY+1;
  ```
- You can refer to multiple temporary tables in the same
  query, but you cannot refer to any given temporary table
  more than once. For example, the following does not work:

  ```sql
  mysql> SELECT * FROM temp_table, temp_table AS t2;
  ERROR 1137: Can't reopen table: 'temp_table'
  ```
- The optimizer may handle `DISTINCT`
  differently when you are using “hidden” columns
  in a join than when you are not. In a join, hidden columns
  are counted as part of the result (even if they are not
  shown), whereas in normal queries, hidden columns do not
  participate in the `DISTINCT` comparison.

  An example of this is:

  ```sql
  SELECT DISTINCT mp3id FROM band_downloads
         WHERE userid = 9 ORDER BY id DESC;
  ```

  and

  ```sql
  SELECT DISTINCT band_downloads.mp3id
         FROM band_downloads,band_mp3
         WHERE band_downloads.userid = 9
         AND band_mp3.id = band_downloads.mp3id
         ORDER BY band_downloads.id DESC;
  ```

  In the second case, you may get two identical rows in the
  result set (because the values in the hidden
  `id` column may differ).

  Note that this happens only for queries that do not have the
  `ORDER BY` columns in the result.
- If you execute a `PROCEDURE` on a query
  that returns an empty set, in some cases the
  `PROCEDURE` does not transform the columns.
- Creation of a table of type `MERGE` does
  not check whether the underlying tables are compatible
  types.
- If you use [`ALTER TABLE`](alter-table.md "15.1.9 ALTER TABLE Statement") to add
  a `UNIQUE` index to a table used in a
  `MERGE` table and then add a normal index
  on the `MERGE` table, the key order is
  different for the tables if there was an old,
  non-`UNIQUE` key in the table. This is
  because [`ALTER TABLE`](alter-table.md "15.1.9 ALTER TABLE Statement") puts
  `UNIQUE` indexes before normal indexes to
  be able to detect duplicate keys as early as possible.
- An [`UPDATE`](update.md "15.2.17 UPDATE Statement") statement involving
  a temporary table with a join on a non-temporary table
  having a trigger defined on it can result in an error, even
  though the update statement reads only the non-temporary
  table, in the following cases:

  - With read-only mode enabled (by using `SET
    GLOBAL`[`read_only`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_read_only)`= 1`).
  - With the transaction level set to
    `READ_ONLY` (that is, using
    [`SET
    GLOBAL TRANSACTION READ ONLY`](set-transaction.md "15.3.7 SET TRANSACTION Statement") or `SET
    SESSION TRANSACTION READ ONLY`).
