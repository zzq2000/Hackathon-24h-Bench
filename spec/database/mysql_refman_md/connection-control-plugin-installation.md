#### 8.4.2.1 Connection Control Plugin Installation

This section describes how to install the connection control
plugins, `CONNECTION_CONTROL` and
`CONNECTION_CONTROL_FAILED_LOGIN_ATTEMPTS`. For
general information about installing plugins, see
[Section 7.6.1, “Installing and Uninstalling Plugins”](plugin-loading.md "7.6.1 Installing and Uninstalling Plugins").

To be usable by the server, the plugin library file must be
located in the MySQL plugin directory (the directory named by
the [`plugin_dir`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_plugin_dir) system
variable). If necessary, configure the plugin directory location
by setting the value of
[`plugin_dir`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_plugin_dir) at server startup.

The plugin library file base name is
`connection_control`. The file name suffix
differs per platform (for example, `.so` for
Unix and Unix-like systems, `.dll` for
Windows).

To load the plugins at server startup, use the
[`--plugin-load-add`](server-options.md#option_mysqld_plugin-load-add) option to name
the library file that contains them. With this plugin-loading
method, the option must be given each time the server starts.
For example, put these lines in the server
`my.cnf` file, adjusting the
`.so` suffix for your platform as necessary:

```ini
[mysqld]
plugin-load-add=connection_control.so
```

After modifying `my.cnf`, restart the server
to cause the new settings to take effect.

Alternatively, to load the plugins at runtime, use these
statements, adjusting the `.so` suffix for
your platform as necessary:

```sql
INSTALL PLUGIN CONNECTION_CONTROL
  SONAME 'connection_control.so';
INSTALL PLUGIN CONNECTION_CONTROL_FAILED_LOGIN_ATTEMPTS
  SONAME 'connection_control.so';
```

[`INSTALL PLUGIN`](install-plugin.md "15.7.4.4 INSTALL PLUGIN Statement") loads the plugin
immediately, and also registers it in the
`mysql.plugins` system table to cause the
server to load it for each subsequent normal startup without the
need for [`--plugin-load-add`](server-options.md#option_mysqld_plugin-load-add).

To verify plugin installation, examine the Information Schema
[`PLUGINS`](information-schema-plugins-table.md "28.3.22 The INFORMATION_SCHEMA PLUGINS Table") table or use the
[`SHOW PLUGINS`](show-plugins.md "15.7.7.25 SHOW PLUGINS Statement") statement (see
[Section 7.6.2, “Obtaining Server Plugin Information”](obtaining-plugin-information.md "7.6.2 Obtaining Server Plugin Information")). For example:

```sql
mysql> SELECT PLUGIN_NAME, PLUGIN_STATUS
       FROM INFORMATION_SCHEMA.PLUGINS
       WHERE PLUGIN_NAME LIKE 'connection%';
+------------------------------------------+---------------+
| PLUGIN_NAME                              | PLUGIN_STATUS |
+------------------------------------------+---------------+
| CONNECTION_CONTROL                       | ACTIVE        |
| CONNECTION_CONTROL_FAILED_LOGIN_ATTEMPTS | ACTIVE        |
+------------------------------------------+---------------+
```

If a plugin fails to initialize, check the server error log for
diagnostic messages.

If the plugins have been previously registered with
[`INSTALL PLUGIN`](install-plugin.md "15.7.4.4 INSTALL PLUGIN Statement") or are loaded with
[`--plugin-load-add`](server-options.md#option_mysqld_plugin-load-add), you can use
the `--connection-control` and
`--connection-control-failed-login-attempts`
options at server startup to control plugin activation. For
example, to load the plugins at startup and prevent them from
being removed at runtime, use these options:

```ini
[mysqld]
plugin-load-add=connection_control.so
connection-control=FORCE_PLUS_PERMANENT
connection-control-failed-login-attempts=FORCE_PLUS_PERMANENT
```

If it is desired to prevent the server from running without a
given connection control plugin, use an option value of
`FORCE` or
`FORCE_PLUS_PERMANENT` to force server startup
to fail if the plugin does not initialize successfully.

Note

It is possible to install one plugin without the other, but
both must be installed for full connection control capability.
In particular, installing only the
`CONNECTION_CONTROL_FAILED_LOGIN_ATTEMPTS`
plugin is of little use because, without the
`CONNECTION_CONTROL` plugin to provide the
data that populates the
[`CONNECTION_CONTROL_FAILED_LOGIN_ATTEMPTS`](information-schema-connection-control-failed-login-attempts-table.md "28.6.2 The INFORMATION_SCHEMA CONNECTION_CONTROL_FAILED_LOGIN_ATTEMPTS Table")
table, the table is always empty.

- [Connection Failure Monitoring](connection-control-plugin-installation.md#connection-control-plugin-failure-monitoring "Connection Failure Monitoring")

##### Connection Delay Configuration

To enable configuring its operation, the
`CONNECTION_CONTROL` plugin exposes these
system variables:

- [`connection_control_failed_connections_threshold`](connection-control-plugin-variables.md#sysvar_connection_control_failed_connections_threshold):
  The number of consecutive failed connection attempts
  permitted to accounts before the server adds a delay for
  subsequent connection attempts. To disable
  failed-connection counting, set
  [`connection_control_failed_connections_threshold`](connection-control-plugin-variables.md#sysvar_connection_control_failed_connections_threshold)
  to zero.
- [`connection_control_min_connection_delay`](connection-control-plugin-variables.md#sysvar_connection_control_min_connection_delay):
  The minimum delay in milliseconds for connection failures
  above the threshold.
- [`connection_control_max_connection_delay`](connection-control-plugin-variables.md#sysvar_connection_control_max_connection_delay):
  The maximum delay in milliseconds for connection failures
  above the threshold.

If
[`connection_control_failed_connections_threshold`](connection-control-plugin-variables.md#sysvar_connection_control_failed_connections_threshold)
is nonzero, failed-connection counting is enabled and has
these properties:

- The delay is zero up through
  [`connection_control_failed_connections_threshold`](connection-control-plugin-variables.md#sysvar_connection_control_failed_connections_threshold)
  consecutive failed connection attempts.
- Thereafter, the server adds an increasing delay for
  subsequent consecutive attempts, until a successful
  connection occurs. The initial unadjusted delays begin at
  1000 milliseconds (1 second) and increase by 1000
  milliseconds per attempt. That is, once delay has been
  activated for an account, the unadjusted delays for
  subsequent failed attempts are 1000 milliseconds, 2000
  milliseconds, 3000 milliseconds, and so forth.
- The actual delay experienced by a client is the unadjusted
  delay, adjusted to lie within the values of the
  [`connection_control_min_connection_delay`](connection-control-plugin-variables.md#sysvar_connection_control_min_connection_delay)
  and
  [`connection_control_max_connection_delay`](connection-control-plugin-variables.md#sysvar_connection_control_max_connection_delay)
  system variables, inclusive.
- Once delay has been activated for an account, the first
  successful connection thereafter by the account also
  experiences a delay, but failure counting is reset for
  subsequent connections.

For example, with the default
[`connection_control_failed_connections_threshold`](connection-control-plugin-variables.md#sysvar_connection_control_failed_connections_threshold)
value of 3, there is no delay for the first three consecutive
failed connection attempts by an account. The actual adjusted
delays experienced by the account for the fourth and
subsequent failed connections depend on the
[`connection_control_min_connection_delay`](connection-control-plugin-variables.md#sysvar_connection_control_min_connection_delay)
and
[`connection_control_max_connection_delay`](connection-control-plugin-variables.md#sysvar_connection_control_max_connection_delay)
values:

- If
  [`connection_control_min_connection_delay`](connection-control-plugin-variables.md#sysvar_connection_control_min_connection_delay)
  and
  [`connection_control_max_connection_delay`](connection-control-plugin-variables.md#sysvar_connection_control_max_connection_delay)
  are 1000 and 20000, the adjusted delays are the same as
  the unadjusted delays, up to a maximum of 20000
  milliseconds. The fourth and subsequent failed connections
  are delayed by 1000 milliseconds, 2000 milliseconds, 3000
  milliseconds, and so forth.
- If
  [`connection_control_min_connection_delay`](connection-control-plugin-variables.md#sysvar_connection_control_min_connection_delay)
  and
  [`connection_control_max_connection_delay`](connection-control-plugin-variables.md#sysvar_connection_control_max_connection_delay)
  are 1500 and 20000, the adjusted delays for the fourth and
  subsequent failed connections are 1500 milliseconds, 2000
  milliseconds, 3000 milliseconds, and so forth, up to a
  maximum of 20000 milliseconds.
- If
  [`connection_control_min_connection_delay`](connection-control-plugin-variables.md#sysvar_connection_control_min_connection_delay)
  and
  [`connection_control_max_connection_delay`](connection-control-plugin-variables.md#sysvar_connection_control_max_connection_delay)
  are 2000 and 3000, the adjusted delays for the fourth and
  subsequent failed connections are 2000 milliseconds, 2000
  milliseconds, and 3000 milliseconds, with all subsequent
  failed connections also delayed by 3000 milliseconds.

You can set the `CONNECTION_CONTROL` system
variables at server startup or runtime. Suppose that you want
to permit four consecutive failed connection attempts before
the server starts delaying its responses, with a minimum delay
of 2000 milliseconds. To set the relevant variables at server
startup, put these lines in the server
`my.cnf` file:

```ini
[mysqld]
plugin-load-add=connection_control.so
connection-control-failed-connections-threshold=4
connection-control-min-connection-delay=2000
```

To set and persist the variables at runtime, use these
statements:

```sql
SET PERSIST connection_control_failed_connections_threshold = 4;
SET PERSIST connection_control_min_connection_delay = 2000;
```

[`SET
PERSIST`](set-variable.md "15.7.6.1 SET Syntax for Variable Assignment") sets a value for the running MySQL instance.
It also saves the value, causing it to carry over to
subsequent server restarts. To change a value for the running
MySQL instance without having it carry over to subsequent
restarts, use the `GLOBAL` keyword rather
than `PERSIST`. See
[Section 15.7.6.1, “SET Syntax for Variable Assignment”](set-variable.md "15.7.6.1 SET Syntax for Variable Assignment").

The
[`connection_control_min_connection_delay`](connection-control-plugin-variables.md#sysvar_connection_control_min_connection_delay)
and
[`connection_control_max_connection_delay`](connection-control-plugin-variables.md#sysvar_connection_control_max_connection_delay)
system variables both have minimum and maximum values of 1000
and 2147483647. In addition, the permitted range of values of
each variable also depends on the current value of the other:

- [`connection_control_min_connection_delay`](connection-control-plugin-variables.md#sysvar_connection_control_min_connection_delay)
  cannot be set greater than the current value of
  [`connection_control_max_connection_delay`](connection-control-plugin-variables.md#sysvar_connection_control_max_connection_delay).
- [`connection_control_max_connection_delay`](connection-control-plugin-variables.md#sysvar_connection_control_max_connection_delay)
  cannot be set less than the current value of
  [`connection_control_min_connection_delay`](connection-control-plugin-variables.md#sysvar_connection_control_min_connection_delay).

Thus, to make the changes required for some configurations,
you might need to set the variables in a specific order.
Suppose that the current minimum and maximum delays are 1000
and 2000, and that you want to set them to 3000 and 5000. You
cannot first set
[`connection_control_min_connection_delay`](connection-control-plugin-variables.md#sysvar_connection_control_min_connection_delay)
to 3000 because that is greater than the current
[`connection_control_max_connection_delay`](connection-control-plugin-variables.md#sysvar_connection_control_max_connection_delay)
value of 2000. Instead, set
[`connection_control_max_connection_delay`](connection-control-plugin-variables.md#sysvar_connection_control_max_connection_delay)
to 5000, then set
[`connection_control_min_connection_delay`](connection-control-plugin-variables.md#sysvar_connection_control_min_connection_delay)
to 3000.

##### Connection Failure Assessment

When the `CONNECTION_CONTROL` plugin is
installed, it checks connection attempts and tracks whether
they fail or succeed. For this purpose, a failed connection
attempt is one for which the client user and host match a
known MySQL account but the provided credentials are
incorrect, or do not match any known account.

Failed-connection counting is based on the user/host
combination for each connection attempt. Determination of the
applicable user name and host name takes proxying into account
and occurs as follows:

- If the client user proxies another user, the account for
  failed-connection counting is the proxying user, not the
  proxied user. For example, if
  `external_user@example.com` proxies
  `proxy_user@example.com`, connection
  counting uses the proxying user,
  `external_user@example.com`, rather than
  the proxied user,
  `proxy_user@example.com`. Both
  `external_user@example.com` and
  `proxy_user@example.com` must have valid
  entries in the `mysql.user` system table
  and a proxy relationship between them must be defined in
  the `mysql.proxies_priv` system table
  (see [Section 8.2.19, “Proxy Users”](proxy-users.md "8.2.19 Proxy Users")).
- If the client user does not proxy another user, but does
  match a `mysql.user` entry, counting uses
  the [`CURRENT_USER()`](information-functions.md#function_current-user) value
  corresponding to that entry. For example, if a user
  `user1` connecting from a host
  `host1.example.com` matches a
  `user1@host1.example.com` entry, counting
  uses `user1@host1.example.com`. If the
  user matches a `user1@%.example.com`,
  `user1@%.com`, or
  `user1@%` entry instead, counting uses
  `user1@%.example.com`,
  `user1@%.com`, or
  `user1@%`, respectively.

For the cases just described, the connection attempt matches
some `mysql.user` entry, and whether the
request succeeds or fails depends on whether the client
provides the correct authentication credentials. For example,
if the client presents an incorrect password, the connection
attempt fails.

If the connection attempt matches no
`mysql.user` entry, the attempt fails. In
this case, no [`CURRENT_USER()`](information-functions.md#function_current-user)
value is available and connection-failure counting uses the
user name provided by the client and the client host as
determined by the server. For example, if a client attempts to
connect as user `user2` from host
`host2.example.com`, the user name part is
available in the client request and the server determines the
host information. The user/host combination used for counting
is `user2@host2.example.com`.

Note

The server maintains information about which client hosts
can possibly connect to the server (essentially the union of
host values for `mysql.user` entries). If a
client attempts to connect from any other host, the server
rejects the attempt at an early stage of connection setup:

```none
ERROR 1130 (HY000): Host 'host_name' is not
allowed to connect to this MySQL server
```

Because this type of rejection occurs so early,
`CONNECTION_CONTROL` does not see it, and
does not count it.

##### Connection Failure Monitoring

To monitor failed connections, use these information sources:

- The
  [`Connection_control_delay_generated`](connection-control-plugin-variables.md#statvar_Connection_control_delay_generated)
  status variable indicates the number of times the server
  added a delay to its response to a failed connection
  attempt. This does not count attempts that occur before
  reaching the threshold defined by the
  [`connection_control_failed_connections_threshold`](connection-control-plugin-variables.md#sysvar_connection_control_failed_connections_threshold)
  system variable.
- The `INFORMATION_SCHEMA`
  [`CONNECTION_CONTROL_FAILED_LOGIN_ATTEMPTS`](information-schema-connection-control-failed-login-attempts-table.md "28.6.2 The INFORMATION_SCHEMA CONNECTION_CONTROL_FAILED_LOGIN_ATTEMPTS Table")
  table provides information about the current number of
  consecutive failed connection attempts per account
  (user/host combination). This counts all failed attempts,
  regardless of whether they were delayed.

Assigning a value to
[`connection_control_failed_connections_threshold`](connection-control-plugin-variables.md#sysvar_connection_control_failed_connections_threshold)
at runtime has these effects:

- All accumulated failed-connection counters are reset to
  zero.
- The
  [`Connection_control_delay_generated`](connection-control-plugin-variables.md#statvar_Connection_control_delay_generated)
  status variable is reset to zero.
- The
  [`CONNECTION_CONTROL_FAILED_LOGIN_ATTEMPTS`](information-schema-connection-control-failed-login-attempts-table.md "28.6.2 The INFORMATION_SCHEMA CONNECTION_CONTROL_FAILED_LOGIN_ATTEMPTS Table")
  table becomes empty.
