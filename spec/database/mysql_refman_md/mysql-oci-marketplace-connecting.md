## 34.4 Connecting

This section describes the various connection methods for
connecting to the deployed MySQL server on the OCI Compute
Instance.

### Connecting with SSH

This section gives some detail on connecting from a UNIX-like
platform to the OCI Compute. For more information on connecting
with SSH, see
[Accessing
an Oracle Linux Instance Using SSH](https://docs.oracle.com/en/cloud/iaas/compute-iaas-cloud/stcsg/accessing-oracle-linux-instance-using-ssh.html#GUID-D947E2CC-0D4C-43F4-B2A9-A517037D6C11) and
[Connecting
to Your Instance](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/GSG/Tasks/testingconnection.htm).

To connect to the Oracle Linux running on the Compute Instance
with SSH, run the following command:

```simple
ssh opc@computeIP
```

where `opc` is the compute user and
*`computeIP`* is the IP address of your
Compute Instance.

To find the temporary root password created for the root user,
run the following command:

```terminal
sudo grep 'temporary password' /var/log/mysqld.log
```

To change your default password, log in to the server using the
generated, temporary password, using the following command:
`mysql -uroot -p`. Then run the following:

```sql
ALTER USER 'root'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'MyNewPass4!';
```

### Connecting with MySQL Client

Note

To connect from your local MySQL client, you must first create
on the MySQL server a user which allows remote login.

To connect to the MySQL Server from your local MySQL client, run
the following command from your shell session:

```simple
mysql -uroot -p -hcomputeIP
```

where *`computeIP`* is the IP address of
your Compute Instance.

### Connecting with MySQL Shell

To connect to the MySQL Server from your local MySQL Shell, run
the following command to start your shell session:

```terminal
mysqlsh \connect root@computeIP
```

where *`computeIP`* is the IP address of
your Compute Instance.

For more information on MySQL Shell connections, see
[MySQL Shell Connections](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/mysql-shell/8.0/en/mysql-shell-connections.html).

### Connecting with Workbench

To connect to the MySQL Server from MySQL Workbench, see
[Connections in MySQL Workbench](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/workbench/en/wb-mysql-connections.html).
