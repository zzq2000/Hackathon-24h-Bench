MySQL supports an plugin API that enables creation of server
plugins. Plugins can be loaded at server startup, or loaded and
unloaded at runtime without restarting the server. The plugins
supported by this interface include, but are not limited to, storage
engines, `INFORMATION_SCHEMA` tables, full-text
parser plugins, and server extensions.

MySQL distributions include several plugins that implement server
extensions:

- Plugins for authenticating attempts by clients to connect to
  MySQL Server. Plugins are available for several authentication
  protocols. See [Section 8.2.17, “Pluggable Authentication”](pluggable-authentication.md "8.2.17 Pluggable Authentication").
- A connection control plugin that enables administrators to
  introduce an increasing delay after a certain number of
  consecutive failed client connection attempts. See
  [Section 8.4.2, “Connection Control Plugins”](connection-control-plugin.md "8.4.2 Connection Control Plugins").
- A password-validation plugin implements password strength
  policies and assesses the strength of potential passwords. See
  [Section 8.4.3, “The Password Validation Component”](validate-password.md "8.4.3 The Password Validation Component").
- Semisynchronous replication plugins implement an interface to
  replication capabilities that permit the source to proceed as
  long as at least one replica has responded to each transaction.
  See [Section 19.4.10, “Semisynchronous Replication”](replication-semisync.md "19.4.10 Semisynchronous Replication").
- Group Replication enables you to create a highly available
  distributed MySQL service across a group of MySQL server
  instances, with data consistency, conflict detection and
  resolution, and group membership services all built-in. See
  [Chapter 20, *Group Replication*](group-replication.md "Chapter 20 Group Replication").
- MySQL Enterprise Edition includes a thread pool plugin that manages connection
  threads to increase server performance by efficiently managing
  statement execution threads for large numbers of client
  connections. See [Section 7.6.3, “MySQL Enterprise Thread Pool”](thread-pool.md "7.6.3 MySQL Enterprise Thread Pool").
- MySQL Enterprise Edition includes an audit plugin for monitoring and logging of
  connection and query activity. See [Section 8.4.5, “MySQL Enterprise Audit”](audit-log.md "8.4.5 MySQL Enterprise Audit").
- MySQL Enterprise Edition includes a firewall plugin that implements an
  application-level firewall to enable database administrators to
  permit or deny SQL statement execution based on matching against
  allowlists of accepted statement patterns. See
  [Section 8.4.7, “MySQL Enterprise Firewall”](firewall.md "8.4.7 MySQL Enterprise Firewall").
- Query rewrite plugins examine statements received by MySQL
  Server and possibly rewrite them before the server executes
  them. See [Section 7.6.4, “The Rewriter Query Rewrite Plugin”](rewriter-query-rewrite-plugin.md "7.6.4 The Rewriter Query Rewrite Plugin"), and
  [Section 7.6.5, “The ddl\_rewriter Plugin”](ddl-rewriter.md "7.6.5 The ddl_rewriter Plugin").
- Version Tokens enables creation of and synchronization around
  server tokens that applications can use to prevent accessing
  incorrect or out-of-date data. Version Tokens is based on a
  plugin library that implements a
  `version_tokens` plugin and a set of loadable
  functions. See [Section 7.6.6, “Version Tokens”](version-tokens.md "7.6.6 Version Tokens").
- Keyring plugins provide secure storage for sensitive
  information. See [Section 8.4.4, “The MySQL Keyring”](keyring.md "8.4.4 The MySQL Keyring").

  In MySQL 8.0.24, MySQL Keyring began transitioning from plugins
  to use the component infrastructure, facilitated using the
  plugin named `daemon_keyring_proxy_plugin` that
  acts as a bridge between the plugin and component service APIs.
  See [Section 7.6.8, “The Keyring Proxy Bridge Plugin”](daemon-keyring-proxy-plugin.md "7.6.8 The Keyring Proxy Bridge Plugin").
- X Plugin extends MySQL Server to be able to function as a
  document store. Running X Plugin enables MySQL Server to
  communicate with clients using the X Protocol, which is
  designed to expose the ACID compliant storage abilities of MySQL
  as a document store. See [Section 22.5, “X Plugin”](x-plugin.md "22.5 X Plugin").
- Clone permits cloning `InnoDB` data from a
  local or remote MySQL server instance. See
  [Section 7.6.7, “The Clone Plugin”](clone-plugin.md "7.6.7 The Clone Plugin").
- Test framework plugins test server services. For information
  about these plugins, see the Plugins for Testing Plugin Services
  section of the MySQL Server Doxygen documentation, available at
  <https://dev.mysql.com/doc/index-other.html>.

The following sections describe how to install and uninstall
plugins, and how to determine at runtime which plugins are installed
and obtain information about them. For information about writing
plugins, see [The MySQL Plugin API](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/extending-mysql/8.0/en/plugin-api.html).
