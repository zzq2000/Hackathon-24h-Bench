#### 7.4.2.8 Error Logging to the System Log

It is possible to have [**mysqld**](mysqld.md "6.3.1 mysqld — The MySQL Server") write the error
log to the system log (the Event Log on Windows, and
`syslog` on Unix and Unix-like systems).

This section describes how to configure error logging using the
built-in filter, `log_filter_internal`, and the
system log sink, `log_sink_syseventlog`, to
take effect immediately and for subsequent server startups. For
general information about configuring error logging, see
[Section 7.4.2.1, “Error Log Configuration”](error-log-configuration.md "7.4.2.1 Error Log Configuration").

To enable the system log sink, first load the sink component,
then modify the
[`log_error_services`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_log_error_services) value:

```sql
INSTALL COMPONENT 'file://component_log_sink_syseventlog';
SET PERSIST log_error_services = 'log_filter_internal; log_sink_syseventlog';
```

To set [`log_error_services`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_log_error_services) to
take effect at server startup, use the instructions at
[Section 7.4.2.1, “Error Log Configuration”](error-log-configuration.md "7.4.2.1 Error Log Configuration"). Those instructions
apply to other error-logging system variables as well.

Note

For MySQL 8.0 configuration, you must enable
error logging to the system log explicitly. This differs from
MySQL 5.7 and earlier, for which error logging to the system
log is enabled by default on Windows, and on all platforms
requires no component loading.

Error logging to the system log may require additional system
configuration. Consult the system log documentation for your
platform.

On Windows, error messages written to the Event Log within the
Application log have these characteristics:

- Entries marked as `Error`,
  `Warning`, and `Note` are
  written to the Event Log, but not messages such as
  information statements from individual storage engines.
- Event Log entries have a source of `MySQL`
  (or `MySQL-tag`
  if [`syseventlog.tag`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_syseventlog.tag) is
  defined as *`tag`*).

On Unix and Unix-like systems, logging to the system log uses
`syslog`. The following system variables affect
`syslog` messages:

- [`syseventlog.facility`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_syseventlog.facility): The
  default facility for `syslog` messages is
  `daemon`. Set this variable to specify a
  different facility.
- [`syseventlog.include_pid`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_syseventlog.include_pid):
  Whether to include the server process ID in each line of
  `syslog` output.
- [`syseventlog.tag`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_syseventlog.tag): This
  variable defines a tag to add to the server identifier
  (`mysqld`) in `syslog`
  messages. If defined, the tag is appended to the identifier
  with a leading hyphen.

Note

Prior to MySQL 8.0.13, use the
[`log_syslog_facility`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_log_syslog_facility),
[`log_syslog_include_pid`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_log_syslog_include_pid), and
[`log_syslog_tag`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_log_syslog_tag) system
variables rather than the
`syseventlog.xxx`
variables.

MySQL uses the custom label “System” for important
system messages about non-error situations, such as startup,
shutdown, and some significant changes to settings. In logs that
do not support custom labels, including the Event Log on
Windows, and `syslog` on Unix and Unix-like
systems, system messages are assigned the label used for the
information priority level. However, these messages are printed
to the log even if the MySQL
[`log_error_verbosity`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_log_error_verbosity) setting
normally excludes messages at the information level.

When a log sink must fall back to a label of
“Information” instead of “System” in
this way, and the log event is further processed outside of the
MySQL server (for example, filtered or forwarded by a
`syslog` configuration), these events may by
default be processed by the secondary application as being of
“Information” priority rather than
“System” priority.
