### 14.16.9 Functions That Test Spatial Relations Between Geometry Objects

[14.16.9.1 Spatial Relation Functions That Use Object Shapes](spatial-relation-functions-object-shapes.md)

[14.16.9.2 Spatial Relation Functions That Use Minimum Bounding Rectangles](spatial-relation-functions-mbr.md)

The functions described in this section take two geometries as
arguments and return a qualitative or quantitative relation
between them.

MySQL implements two sets of functions using function names
defined by the OpenGIS specification. One set tests the
relationship between two geometry values using precise object
shapes, the other set uses object minimum bounding rectangles
(MBRs).
