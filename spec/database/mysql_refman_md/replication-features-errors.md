#### 19.5.1.29 Replica Errors During Replication

If a statement produces the same error (identical error code) on
both the source and the replica, the error is logged, but
replication continues.

If a statement produces different errors on the source and the
replica, the replication SQL thread terminates, and the replica
writes a message to its error log and waits for the database
administrator to decide what to do about the error. This
includes the case that a statement produces an error on the
source or the replica, but not both. To address the issue,
connect to the replica manually and determine the cause of the
problem. [`SHOW REPLICA STATUS`](show-replica-status.md "15.7.7.35 SHOW REPLICA STATUS Statement") (or
before MySQL 8.0.22, [`SHOW SLAVE
STATUS`](show-slave-status.md "15.7.7.36 SHOW SLAVE | REPLICA STATUS Statement")) is useful for this. Then fix the problem and
run [`START REPLICA`](start-replica.md "15.4.2.6 START REPLICA Statement") (or before
MySQL 8.0.22, [`START SLAVE`](start-slave.md "15.4.2.7 START SLAVE Statement")). For
example, you might need to create a nonexistent table before you
can start the replica again.

Note

If a temporary error is recorded in the replica's error log,
you do not necessarily have to take any action suggested in
the quoted error message. Temporary errors should be handled
by the client retrying the transaction. For example, if the
replication SQL thread records a temporary error relating to
a deadlock, you do not need to restart the transaction
manually on the replica, unless the replication SQL thread
subsequently terminates with a nontemporary error message.

If this error code validation behavior is not desirable, some or
all errors can be masked out (ignored) with the
[`--slave-skip-errors`](replication-options-replica.md#option_mysqld_slave-skip-errors) option.

For nontransactional storage engines such as
[`MyISAM`](myisam-storage-engine.md "18.2 The MyISAM Storage Engine"), it is possible to have a
statement that only partially updates a table and returns an
error code. This can happen, for example, on a multiple-row
insert that has one row violating a key constraint, or if a long
update statement is killed after updating some of the rows. If
that happens on the source, the replica expects execution of the
statement to result in the same error code. If it does not, the
replication SQL thread stops as described previously.

If you are replicating between tables that use different storage
engines on the source and replica, keep in mind that the same
statement might produce a different error when run against one
version of the table, but not the other, or might cause an error
for one version of the table, but not the other. For example,
since `MyISAM` ignores foreign key constraints,
an [`INSERT`](insert.md "15.2.7 INSERT Statement") or
[`UPDATE`](update.md "15.2.17 UPDATE Statement") statement accessing an
`InnoDB` table on the source might cause a
foreign key violation but the same statement performed on a
`MyISAM` version of the same table on the
replica would produce no such error, causing replication to
stop.

Beginning with MySQL 8.0.31, replication filter rules are
applied first, prior to making any privilege or row format
checks, making it possible to filter out any transactions that
fail validation; no checks are performed and thus no errors are
raised for transactions which have been filtered out. This means
that the replica can accept only that part of the database to
which a given user has been granted access (as long as any
updates to this part of the database use the row-based
replication format). This may be helpful when performing an
upgrade or when migrating to a system or application that uses
administration tables to which the inbound replication user does
not have access. See also [Section 19.2.5, “How Servers Evaluate Replication Filtering Rules”](replication-rules.md "19.2.5 How Servers Evaluate Replication Filtering Rules").
