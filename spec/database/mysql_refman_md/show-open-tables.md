#### 15.7.7.24 SHOW OPEN TABLES Statement

```sql
SHOW OPEN TABLES
    [{FROM | IN} db_name]
    [LIKE 'pattern' | WHERE expr]
```

[`SHOW OPEN TABLES`](show-open-tables.md "15.7.7.24 SHOW OPEN TABLES Statement") lists the
non-`TEMPORARY` tables that are currently open
in the table cache. See [Section 10.4.3.1, “How MySQL Opens and Closes Tables”](table-cache.md "10.4.3.1 How MySQL Opens and Closes Tables"). The
`FROM` clause, if present, restricts the tables
shown to those present in the *`db_name`*
database. The [`LIKE`](string-comparison-functions.md#operator_like) clause, if
present, indicates which table names to match. The
`WHERE` clause can be given to select rows
using more general conditions, as discussed in
[Section 28.8, “Extensions to SHOW Statements”](extended-show.md "28.8 Extensions to SHOW Statements").

[`SHOW OPEN TABLES`](show-open-tables.md "15.7.7.24 SHOW OPEN TABLES Statement") output has these
columns:

- `Database`

  The database containing the table.
- `Table`

  The table name.
- `In_use`

  The number of table locks or lock requests there are for the
  table. For example, if one client acquires a lock for a
  table using `LOCK TABLE t1 WRITE`,
  `In_use` is 1. If another client issues
  `LOCK TABLE t1 WRITE` while the table
  remains locked, the client blocks, waiting for the lock, but
  the lock request causes `In_use` to be 2.
  If the count is zero, the table is open but not currently
  being used. `In_use` is also increased by
  the [`HANDLER ...
  OPEN`](handler.md "15.2.5 HANDLER Statement") statement and decreased by
  [`HANDLER ...
  CLOSE`](handler.md "15.2.5 HANDLER Statement").
- `Name_locked`

  Whether the table name is locked. Name locking is used for
  operations such as dropping or renaming tables.

If you have no privileges for a table, it does not show up in
the output from [`SHOW OPEN TABLES`](show-open-tables.md "15.7.7.24 SHOW OPEN TABLES Statement").
