### 19.4.4 Using Replication with Different Source and Replica Storage Engines

It does not matter for the replication process whether the
original table on the source and the replicated table on the
replica use different storage engine types. In fact, the
[`default_storage_engine`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_default_storage_engine) system
variable is not replicated.

This provides a number of benefits in the replication process in
that you can take advantage of different engine types for
different replication scenarios. For example, in a typical
scale-out scenario (see
[Section 19.4.5, “Using Replication for Scale-Out”](replication-solutions-scaleout.md "19.4.5 Using Replication for Scale-Out")), you want to use
`InnoDB` tables on the source to take advantage
of the transactional functionality, but use
`MyISAM` on the replicas where transaction
support is not required because the data is only read. When using
replication in a data-logging environment you may want to use the
`Archive` storage engine on the replica.

Configuring different engines on the source and replica depends on
how you set up the initial replication process:

- If you used [**mysqldump**](mysqldump.md "6.5.4 mysqldump — A Database Backup Program") to create the
  database snapshot on your source, you could edit the dump file
  text to change the engine type used on each table.

  Another alternative for [**mysqldump**](mysqldump.md "6.5.4 mysqldump — A Database Backup Program") is to
  disable engine types that you do not want to use on the
  replica before using the dump to build the data on the
  replica. For example, you can add the
  `--skip-federated` option on your replica to
  disable the [`FEDERATED`](federated-storage-engine.md "18.8 The FEDERATED Storage Engine") engine. If
  a specific engine does not exist for a table to be created,
  MySQL uses the default engine type, usually
  [`InnoDB`](innodb-storage-engine.md "Chapter 17 The InnoDB Storage Engine"). (This requires that the
  [`NO_ENGINE_SUBSTITUTION`](sql-mode.md#sqlmode_no_engine_substitution) SQL
  mode is not enabled.) If you want to disable additional
  engines in this way, you may want to consider building a
  special binary to be used on the replica that supports only
  the engines you want.
- If you use raw data files (a binary backup) to set up the
  replica, it is not possible to change the initial table
  format. Instead, use [`ALTER
  TABLE`](alter-table.md "15.1.9 ALTER TABLE Statement") to change the table types after the replica
  has been started.
- For new source/replica replication setups where there are
  currently no tables on the source, avoid specifying the engine
  type when creating new tables.

If you are already running a replication solution and want to
convert your existing tables to another engine type, follow these
steps:

1. Stop the replica from running replication updates:

   ```sql
   mysql> STOP SLAVE;
   Or from MySQL 8.0.22:
   mysql> STOP REPLICA;
   ```

   This makes it possible to change engine types without
   interruption.
2. Execute an `ALTER TABLE ...
   ENGINE='engine_type'` for
   each table to be changed.
3. Start the replication process again:

   ```sql
   mysql> START SLAVE;
   ```

   Or, beginning with MySQL 8.0.22:

   ```sql
   mysql> START REPLICA;
   ```

Although the
[`default_storage_engine`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_default_storage_engine) variable
is not replicated, be aware that [`CREATE
TABLE`](create-table.md "15.1.20 CREATE TABLE Statement") and [`ALTER TABLE`](alter-table.md "15.1.9 ALTER TABLE Statement")
statements that include the engine specification are replicated to
the replica correctly. If, in the case of a
[`CSV`](csv-storage-engine.md "18.4 The CSV Storage Engine") table, you execute this
statement:

```sql
mysql> ALTER TABLE csvtable ENGINE='MyISAM';
```

This statement is replicated; the table's engine type on the
replica is converted to `InnoDB`, even if you
have previously changed the table type on the replica to an engine
other than `CSV`. If you want to retain engine
differences on the source and replica, you should be careful to
use the [`default_storage_engine`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_default_storage_engine)
variable on the source when creating a new table. For example,
instead of:

```sql
mysql> CREATE TABLE tablea (columna int) Engine=MyISAM;
```

Use this format:

```sql
mysql> SET default_storage_engine=MyISAM;
mysql> CREATE TABLE tablea (columna int);
```

When replicated, the
[`default_storage_engine`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_default_storage_engine) variable
is ignored, and the [`CREATE TABLE`](create-table.md "15.1.20 CREATE TABLE Statement")
statement executes on the replica using the replica's default
engine.
