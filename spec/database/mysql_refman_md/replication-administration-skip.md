#### 19.1.7.3 Skipping Transactions

If replication stops due to an issue with an event in a
replicated transaction, you can resume replication by skipping
the failed transaction on the replica. Before skipping a
transaction, ensure that the replication I/O (receiver) thread
is stopped as well as the SQL (applier) thread.

First you need to identify the replicated event that caused the
error. Details of the error and the last successfully applied
transaction are recorded in the Performance Schema table
[`replication_applier_status_by_worker`](performance-schema-replication-applier-status-by-worker-table.md "29.12.11.5 The replication_applier_status_by_worker Table").
You can use [**mysqlbinlog**](mysqlbinlog.md "6.6.9 mysqlbinlog — Utility for Processing Binary Log Files") to retrieve and
display the events that were logged around the time of the
error. For instructions to do this, see
[Section 9.5, “Point-in-Time (Incremental) Recovery”](point-in-time-recovery.md "9.5 Point-in-Time (Incremental) Recovery"). Alternatively, you can
issue [`SHOW RELAYLOG EVENTS`](show-relaylog-events.md "15.7.7.32 SHOW RELAYLOG EVENTS Statement") on the
replica or [`SHOW BINLOG EVENTS`](show-binlog-events.md "15.7.7.2 SHOW BINLOG EVENTS Statement") on
the source.

Before skipping the transaction and restarting the replica,
check these points:

- Is the transaction that stopped replication from an unknown
  or untrusted source? If so, investigate the cause in case
  there are any security considerations that indicate the
  replica should not be restarted.
- Does the transaction that stopped replication need to be
  applied on the replica? If so, either make the appropriate
  corrections and reapply the transaction, or manually
  reconcile the data on the replica.
- Did the transaction that stopped replication need to be
  applied on the source? If not, undo the transaction manually
  on the server where it originally took place.

To skip the transaction, choose one of the following methods as
appropriate:

- When GTIDs are in use
  ([`gtid_mode`](replication-options-gtids.md#sysvar_gtid_mode) is
  `ON`), see
  [Section 19.1.7.3.1, “Skipping Transactions With GTIDs”](replication-administration-skip.md#replication-administration-skip-gtid "19.1.7.3.1 Skipping Transactions With GTIDs") .
- When GTIDs are not in use or are being phased in
  ([`gtid_mode`](replication-options-gtids.md#sysvar_gtid_mode) is
  `OFF`, `OFF_PERMISSIVE`,
  or `ON_PERMISSIVE`), see
  [Section 19.1.7.3.2, “Skipping Transactions Without GTIDs”](replication-administration-skip.md#replication-administration-skip-nogtid "19.1.7.3.2 Skipping Transactions Without GTIDs").
- If you have enabled GTID assignment on a replication channel
  using the
  `ASSIGN_GTIDS_TO_ANONYMOUS_TRANSACTIONS`
  option of the [`CHANGE REPLICATION SOURCE
  TO`](change-replication-source-to.md "15.4.2.3 CHANGE REPLICATION SOURCE TO Statement") or [`CHANGE MASTER
  TO`](change-master-to.md "15.4.2.1 CHANGE MASTER TO Statement") statement, see
  [Section 19.1.7.3.2, “Skipping Transactions Without GTIDs”](replication-administration-skip.md#replication-administration-skip-nogtid "19.1.7.3.2 Skipping Transactions Without GTIDs").
  Using
  `ASSIGN_GTIDS_TO_ANONYMOUS_TRANSACTIONS` on
  a replication channel is not the same as introducing
  GTID-based replication for the channel, and you cannot use
  the transaction skipping method for GTID-based replication
  with those channels.

To restart replication after skipping the transaction, issue
[`START REPLICA`](start-replica.md "15.4.2.6 START REPLICA Statement"), with the
`FOR CHANNEL` clause if the replica is a
multi-source replica.

##### 19.1.7.3.1 Skipping Transactions With GTIDs

When GTIDs are in use
([`gtid_mode`](replication-options-gtids.md#sysvar_gtid_mode) is
`ON`), the GTID for a committed transaction
is persisted on the replica even if the content of the
transaction is filtered out. This feature prevents a replica
from retrieving previously filtered transactions when it
reconnects to the source using GTID auto-positioning. It can
also be used to skip a transaction on the replica, by
committing an empty transaction in place of the failing
transaction.

This method of skipping transactions is not suitable when you
have enabled GTID assignment on a replication channel using
the `ASSIGN_GTIDS_TO_ANONYMOUS_TRANSACTIONS`
option of the [`CHANGE REPLICATION SOURCE
TO`](change-replication-source-to.md "15.4.2.3 CHANGE REPLICATION SOURCE TO Statement") statement.

If the failing transaction generated an error in a worker
thread, you can obtain its GTID directly from the
`APPLYING_TRANSACTION` field in the
Performance Schema table
[`replication_applier_status_by_worker`](performance-schema-replication-applier-status-by-worker-table.md "29.12.11.5 The replication_applier_status_by_worker Table").
To see what the transaction is, issue
[`SHOW RELAYLOG EVENTS`](show-relaylog-events.md "15.7.7.32 SHOW RELAYLOG EVENTS Statement") on the
replica or [`SHOW BINLOG
EVENTS`](show-binlog-events.md "15.7.7.2 SHOW BINLOG EVENTS Statement") on the source, and search the output for a
transaction preceded by that GTID.

When you have assessed the failing transaction for any other
appropriate actions as described previously (such as security
considerations), to skip it, commit an empty transaction on
the replica that has the same GTID as the failing transaction.
For example:

```sql
SET GTID_NEXT='aaa-bbb-ccc-ddd:N';
BEGIN;
COMMIT;
SET GTID_NEXT='AUTOMATIC';
```

The presence of this empty transaction on the replica means
that when you issue a [`START
REPLICA`](start-replica.md "15.4.2.6 START REPLICA Statement") statement to restart replication, the
replica uses the auto-skip function to ignore the failing
transaction, because it sees a transaction with that GTID has
already been applied. If the replica is a multi-source
replica, you do not need to specify the channel name when you
commit the empty transaction, but you do need to specify the
channel name when you issue [`START
REPLICA`](start-replica.md "15.4.2.6 START REPLICA Statement").

Note that if binary logging is in use on this replica, the
empty transaction enters the replication stream if the replica
becomes a source or primary in the future. If you need to
avoid this possibility, consider flushing and purging the
replica's binary logs, as in this example:

```sql
FLUSH LOGS;
PURGE BINARY LOGS TO 'binlog.000146';
```

The GTID of the empty transaction is persisted, but the
transaction itself is removed by purging the binary log files.

##### 19.1.7.3.2 Skipping Transactions Without GTIDs

To skip failing transactions when GTIDs are not in use or are
being phased in ([`gtid_mode`](replication-options-gtids.md#sysvar_gtid_mode) is
`OFF`, `OFF_PERMISSIVE`, or
`ON_PERMISSIVE`), you can skip a specified
number of events by issuing a `SET GLOBAL
sql_replica_skip_counter` statement (from MySQL
8.0.26) or a `SET GLOBAL
sql_slave_skip_counter` statement. Alternatively, you
can skip past an event or events by issuing a
[`CHANGE REPLICATION SOURCE TO`](change-replication-source-to.md "15.4.2.3 CHANGE REPLICATION SOURCE TO Statement") or
[`CHANGE MASTER TO`](change-master-to.md "15.4.2.1 CHANGE MASTER TO Statement") statement to
move the source binary log position forward.

These methods are also suitable when you have enabled GTID
assignment on a replication channel using the
`ASSIGN_GTIDS_TO_ANONYMOUS_TRANSACTIONS`
option of the [`CHANGE REPLICATION SOURCE
TO`](change-replication-source-to.md "15.4.2.3 CHANGE REPLICATION SOURCE TO Statement") or [`CHANGE MASTER
TO`](change-master-to.md "15.4.2.1 CHANGE MASTER TO Statement") statement.

When you use these methods, it is important to understand that
you are not necessarily skipping a complete transaction, as is
always the case with the GTID-based method described
previously. These non-GTID-based methods are not aware of
transactions as such, but instead operate on events. The
binary log is organized as a sequence of groups known as event
groups, and each event group consists of a sequence of events.

- For transactional tables, an event group corresponds to a
  transaction.
- For nontransactional tables, an event group corresponds to
  a single SQL statement.

A single transaction can contain changes to both transactional
and nontransactional tables.

When you use a `SET GLOBAL
sql_replica_skip_counter` or `SET GLOBAL
sql_slave_skip_counter` statement to skip events and
the resulting position is in the middle of an event group, the
replica continues to skip events until it reaches the end of
the group. Execution then starts with the next event group.
The [`CHANGE REPLICATION SOURCE
TO`](change-replication-source-to.md "15.4.2.3 CHANGE REPLICATION SOURCE TO Statement") or [`CHANGE MASTER
TO`](change-master-to.md "15.4.2.1 CHANGE MASTER TO Statement") statement does not have this function, so you
must be careful to identify the correct location to restart
replication at the beginning of an event group. However, using
[`CHANGE REPLICATION SOURCE TO`](change-replication-source-to.md "15.4.2.3 CHANGE REPLICATION SOURCE TO Statement") or
[`CHANGE MASTER TO`](change-master-to.md "15.4.2.1 CHANGE MASTER TO Statement") means you do
not have to count the events that need to be skipped, as you
do with `SET GLOBAL sql_replica_skip_counter`
or `SET GLOBAL sql_slave_skip_counter`, and
instead you can just specify the location to restart.

###### 19.1.7.3.2.1 Skipping Transactions With `SET GLOBAL sql_slave_skip_counter`

When you have assessed the failing transaction for any other
appropriate actions as described previously (such as
security considerations), count the number of events that
you need to skip. One event normally corresponds to one SQL
statement in the binary log, but note that statements that
use `AUTO_INCREMENT` or
`LAST_INSERT_ID()` count as two events in
the binary log. When binary log transaction compression is
in use, a compressed transaction payload
(`Transaction_payload_event`) is counted as
a single counter value, so all the events inside it are
skipped as a unit.

If you want to skip the complete transaction, you can count
the events to the end of the transaction, or you can just
skip the relevant event group. Remember that with
`SET GLOBAL sql_replica_skip_counter` or
`SET GLOBAL sql_slave_skip_counter`, the
replica continues to skip to the end of an event group. Make
sure you do not skip too far forward and go into the next
event group or transaction so that it is not also skipped.

Issue the `SET` statement as follows, where
*`N`* is the number of events from
the source to skip:

```sql
SET GLOBAL sql_slave_skip_counter = N

Or from MySQL 8.0.26:
SET GLOBAL sql_replica_skip_counter = N
```

This statement cannot be issued if
[`gtid_mode=ON`](replication-options-gtids.md#sysvar_gtid_mode) is set, or if
the replication I/O (receiver) and SQL (applier) threads are
running.

The `SET GLOBAL sql_replica_skip_counter`
or `SET GLOBAL sql_slave_skip_counter`
statement has no immediate effect. When you issue the
[`START REPLICA`](start-replica.md "15.4.2.6 START REPLICA Statement") statement for
the next time following this `SET`
statement, the new value for the system variable
[`sql_replica_skip_counter`](replication-options-replica.md#sysvar_sql_replica_skip_counter) or
[`sql_slave_skip_counter`](replication-options-replica.md#sysvar_sql_slave_skip_counter) is
applied, and the events are skipped. That
[`START REPLICA`](start-replica.md "15.4.2.6 START REPLICA Statement") statement also
automatically sets the value of the system variable back to
0. If the replica is a multi-source replica, when you issue
that [`START REPLICA`](start-replica.md "15.4.2.6 START REPLICA Statement") statement,
the `FOR CHANNEL` clause is required. Make
sure that you name the correct channel, otherwise events are
skipped on the wrong channel.

###### 19.1.7.3.2.2 Skipping Transactions With `CHANGE MASTER TO`

When you have assessed the failing transaction for any other
appropriate actions as described previously (such as
security considerations), identify the coordinates (file and
position) in the source's binary log that represent a
suitable position to restart replication. This can be the
start of the event group following the event that caused the
issue, or the start of the next transaction. The replication
I/O (receiver) thread begins reading from the source at
these coordinates the next time the thread starts, skipping
the failing event. Make sure that you have identified the
position accurately, because this statement does not take
event groups into account.

Issue the [`CHANGE REPLICATION SOURCE
TO`](change-replication-source-to.md "15.4.2.3 CHANGE REPLICATION SOURCE TO Statement") or [`CHANGE MASTER
TO`](change-master-to.md "15.4.2.1 CHANGE MASTER TO Statement") statement as follows, where
*`source_log_name`* is the binary log
file that contains the restart position, and
*`source_log_pos`* is the number
representing the restart position as stated in the binary
log file:

```sql
CHANGE MASTER TO MASTER_LOG_FILE='source_log_name', MASTER_LOG_POS=source_log_pos;

Or from MySQL 8.0.24:
CHANGE REPLICATION SOURCE TO SOURCE_LOG_FILE='source_log_name', SOURCE_LOG_POS=source_log_pos;
```

If the replica is a multi-source replica, you must use the
`FOR CHANNEL` clause to name the
appropriate channel on the [`CHANGE
REPLICATION SOURCE TO`](change-replication-source-to.md "15.4.2.3 CHANGE REPLICATION SOURCE TO Statement") or
[`CHANGE MASTER TO`](change-master-to.md "15.4.2.1 CHANGE MASTER TO Statement") statement.

This statement cannot be issued if
`SOURCE_AUTO_POSITION=1` or
`MASTER_AUTO_POSITION=1` is set, or if the
replication I/O (receiver) and SQL (applier) threads are
running. If you need to use this method of skipping a
transaction when `SOURCE_AUTO_POSITION=1`
or `MASTER_AUTO_POSITION=1` is normally
set, you can change the setting to
`SOURCE_AUTO_POSITION=0` or
`MASTER_AUTO_POSITION=0` while issuing the
statement, then change it back again afterwards. For
example:

```sql
CHANGE MASTER TO MASTER_AUTO_POSITION=0, MASTER_LOG_FILE='binlog.000145', MASTER_LOG_POS=235;
CHANGE MASTER TO MASTER_AUTO_POSITION=1;

Or from MySQL 8.0.24:

CHANGE REPLICATION SOURCE TO SOURCE_AUTO_POSITION=0, SOURCE_LOG_FILE='binlog.000145', SOURCE_LOG_POS=235;
CHANGE REPLICATION SOURCE TO SOURCE_AUTO_POSITION=1;
```
