### 12.8.4 Collation Coercibility in Expressions

In the great majority of statements, it is obvious what
collation MySQL uses to resolve a comparison operation. For
example, in the following cases, it should be clear that the
collation is the collation of column `x`:

```sql
SELECT x FROM T ORDER BY x;
SELECT x FROM T WHERE x = x;
SELECT DISTINCT x FROM T;
```

However, with multiple operands, there can be ambiguity. For
example, this statement performs a comparison between the column
`x` and the string literal
`'Y'`:

```sql
SELECT x FROM T WHERE x = 'Y';
```

If `x` and `'Y'` have the same
collation, there is no ambiguity about the collation to use for
the comparison. But if they have different collations, should
the comparison use the collation of `x`, or of
`'Y'`? Both `x` and
`'Y'` have collations, so which collation takes
precedence?

A mix of collations may also occur in contexts other than
comparison. For example, a multiple-argument concatenation
operation such as [`CONCAT(x,'Y')`](string-functions.md#function_concat)
combines its arguments to produce a single string. What
collation should the result have?

To resolve questions like these, MySQL checks whether the
collation of one item can be coerced to the collation of the
other. MySQL assigns coercibility values as follows:

- An explicit `COLLATE` clause has a
  coercibility of 0 (not coercible at all).
- The concatenation of two strings with different collations
  has a coercibility of 1.
- The collation of a column or a stored routine parameter or
  local variable has a coercibility of 2.
- A “system constant” (the string returned by
  functions such as [`USER()`](information-functions.md#function_user) or
  [`VERSION()`](information-functions.md#function_version)) has a coercibility
  of 3.
- The collation of a literal has a coercibility of 4.
- The collation of a numeric or temporal value has a
  coercibility of 5.
- `NULL` or an expression that is derived
  from `NULL` has a coercibility of 6.

MySQL uses coercibility values with the following rules to
resolve ambiguities:

- Use the collation with the lowest coercibility value.
- If both sides have the same coercibility, then:

  - If both sides are Unicode, or both sides are not
    Unicode, it is an error.
  - If one of the sides has a Unicode character set, and
    another side has a non-Unicode character set, the side
    with Unicode character set wins, and automatic character
    set conversion is applied to the non-Unicode side. For
    example, the following statement does not return an
    error:

    ```sql
    SELECT CONCAT(utf8mb4_column, latin1_column) FROM t1;
    ```

    It returns a result that has a character set of
    `utf8mb4` and the same collation as
    `utf8mb4_column`. Values of
    `latin1_column` are automatically
    converted to `utf8mb4` before
    concatenating.
  - For an operation with operands from the same character
    set but that mix a `_bin` collation and
    a `_ci` or `_cs`
    collation, the `_bin` collation is
    used. This is similar to how operations that mix
    nonbinary and binary strings evaluate the operands as
    binary strings, applied to collations rather than data
    types.

Although automatic conversion is not in the SQL standard, the
standard does say that every character set is (in terms of
supported characters) a “subset” of Unicode.
Because it is a well-known principle that “what applies to
a superset can apply to a subset,” we believe that a
collation for Unicode can apply for comparisons with non-Unicode
strings. More generally, MySQL uses the concept of character set
repertoire, which can sometimes be used to determine subset
relationships among character sets and enable conversion of
operands in operations that would otherwise produce an error.
See [Section 12.2.1, “Character Set Repertoire”](charset-repertoire.md "12.2.1 Character Set Repertoire").

The following table illustrates some applications of the
preceding rules.

| Comparison | Collation Used |
| --- | --- |
| `column1 = 'A'` | Use collation of `column1` |
| `column1 = 'A' COLLATE x` | Use collation of `'A' COLLATE x` |
| `column1 COLLATE x = 'A' COLLATE y` | Error |

To determine the coercibility of a string expression, use the
[`COERCIBILITY()`](information-functions.md#function_coercibility) function (see
[Section 14.15, “Information Functions”](information-functions.md "14.15 Information Functions")):

```sql
mysql> SELECT COERCIBILITY(_utf8mb4'A' COLLATE utf8mb4_bin);
        -> 0
mysql> SELECT COERCIBILITY(VERSION());
        -> 3
mysql> SELECT COERCIBILITY('A');
        -> 4
mysql> SELECT COERCIBILITY(1000);
        -> 5
mysql> SELECT COERCIBILITY(NULL);
        -> 6
```

For implicit conversion of a numeric or temporal value to a
string, such as occurs for the argument `1` in
the expression [`CONCAT(1, 'abc')`](string-functions.md#function_concat),
the result is a character (nonbinary) string that has a
character set and collation determined by the
[`character_set_connection`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_character_set_connection) and
[`collation_connection`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_collation_connection) system
variables. See [Section 14.3, “Type Conversion in Expression Evaluation”](type-conversion.md "14.3 Type Conversion in Expression Evaluation").
