#### 15.7.4.5 UNINSTALL COMPONENT Statement

```sql
UNINSTALL COMPONENT component_name [, component_name ] ...
```

This statement deactivates and uninstalls one or more
components. A component provides services that are available to
the server and other components; see
[Section 7.5, “MySQL Components”](components.md "7.5 MySQL Components"). [`UNINSTALL
COMPONENT`](uninstall-component.md "15.7.4.5 UNINSTALL COMPONENT Statement") is the complement of
[`INSTALL COMPONENT`](install-component.md "15.7.4.3 INSTALL COMPONENT Statement"). It requires
the [`DELETE`](privileges-provided.md#priv_delete) privilege for the
`mysql.component` system table because it
removes the row from that table that registers the component.
[`UNINSTALL COMPONENT`](uninstall-component.md "15.7.4.5 UNINSTALL COMPONENT Statement") does not undo
persisted variables, including the variables persisted using
`INSTALL COMPONENT ... SET PERSIST`.

Example:

```sql
UNINSTALL COMPONENT 'file://component1', 'file://component2';
```

For information about component naming, see
[Section 15.7.4.3, “INSTALL COMPONENT Statement”](install-component.md "15.7.4.3 INSTALL COMPONENT Statement").

If any error occurs, the statement fails and has no effect. For
example, this happens if a component name is erroneous, a named
component is not installed, or cannot be uninstalled because
other installed components depend on it.

A loader service handles component unloading, which includes
removing uninstalled components from the
`mysql.component` system table that serves as a
registry. As a result, unloaded components are not loaded during
the startup sequence for subsequent server restarts.

Note

This statement has no effect for keyring components, which are
loaded using a manifest file and cannot be uninstalled. See
[Section 8.4.4.2, “Keyring Component Installation”](keyring-component-installation.md "8.4.4.2 Keyring Component Installation").
