### 25.7.5 Preparing the NDB Cluster for Replication

Preparing the NDB Cluster for replication consists of the
following steps:

1. Check all MySQL servers for version compatibility (see
   [Section 25.7.2, “General Requirements for NDB Cluster Replication”](mysql-cluster-replication-general.md "25.7.2 General Requirements for NDB Cluster Replication")).
2. Create a replication account on the source Cluster with the
   appropriate privileges, using the following two SQL
   statements:

   ```sql
   mysqlS> CREATE USER 'replica_user'@'replica_host'
        -> IDENTIFIED BY 'replica_password';

   mysqlS> GRANT REPLICATION SLAVE ON *.*
        -> TO 'replica_user'@'replica_host';
   ```

   In the previous statement,
   *`replica_user`* is the replication
   account user name, *`replica_host`* is
   the host name or IP address of the replica, and
   *`replica_password`* is the password to
   assign to this account.

   For example, to create a replica user account with the name
   `myreplica`, logging in from the host named
   `replica-host`, and using the password
   `53cr37`, use the following
   [`CREATE USER`](create-user.md "15.7.1.3 CREATE USER Statement") and
   [`GRANT`](grant.md "15.7.1.6 GRANT Statement") statements:

   ```sql
   mysqlS> CREATE USER 'myreplica'@'replica-host'
        -> IDENTIFIED BY '53cr37';

   mysqlS> GRANT REPLICATION SLAVE ON *.*
        -> TO 'myreplica'@'replica-host';
   ```

   For security reasons, it is preferable to use a unique user
   account—not employed for any other purpose—for the
   replication account.
3. Set up the replica to use the source. Using the
   [**mysql**](mysql.md "6.5.1 mysql — The MySQL Command-Line Client") client, this can be accomplished with
   the [`CHANGE REPLICATION SOURCE
   TO`](change-replication-source-to.md "15.4.2.3 CHANGE REPLICATION SOURCE TO Statement") statement (beginning with NDB 8.0.23) or
   [`CHANGE MASTER TO`](change-master-to.md "15.4.2.1 CHANGE MASTER TO Statement") statement
   (prior to NDB 8.0.23):

   ```sql
   mysqlR> CHANGE MASTER TO
        -> MASTER_HOST='source_host',
        -> MASTER_PORT=source_port,
        -> MASTER_USER='replica_user',
        -> MASTER_PASSWORD='replica_password';
   ```

   Beginning with NDB 8.0.23, you can also use the following
   statement:

   ```sql
   mysqlR> CHANGE REPLICATION SOURCE TO
        -> SOURCE_HOST='source_host',
        -> SOURCE_PORT=source_port,
        -> SOURCE_USER='replica_user',
        -> SOURCE_PASSWORD='replica_password';
   ```

   In the previous statement,
   *`source_host`* is the host name or IP
   address of the replication source,
   *`source_port`* is the port for the
   replica to use when connecting to the source,
   *`replica_user`* is the user name set
   up for the replica on the source, and
   *`replica_password`* is the password
   set for that user account in the previous step.

   For example, to tell the replica to use the MySQL server whose
   host name is `rep-source` with the
   replication account created in the previous step, use the
   following statement:

   ```sql
   mysqlR> CHANGE MASTER TO
        -> MASTER_HOST='rep-source',
        -> MASTER_PORT=3306,
        -> MASTER_USER='myreplica',
        -> MASTER_PASSWORD='53cr37';
   ```

   Beginning with NDB 8.0.23, you can also use the following
   statement:

   ```sql
   mysqlR> CHANGE REPLICATION SOURCE TO
        -> SOURCE_HOST='rep-source',
        -> SOURCE_PORT=3306,
        -> SOURCE_USER='myreplica',
        -> SOURCE_PASSWORD='53cr37';
   ```

   For a complete list of options that can be used with this
   statement, see [Section 15.4.2.1, “CHANGE MASTER TO Statement”](change-master-to.md "15.4.2.1 CHANGE MASTER TO Statement").

   To provide replication backup capability, you also need to add
   an [`--ndb-connectstring`](mysql-cluster-options-variables.md#option_mysqld_ndb-connectstring) option
   to the replica's `my.cnf` file prior
   to starting the replication process. See
   [Section 25.7.9, “NDB Cluster Backups With NDB Cluster Replication”](mysql-cluster-replication-backups.md "25.7.9 NDB Cluster Backups With NDB Cluster Replication"), for
   details.

   For additional options that can be set in
   `my.cnf` for replicas, see
   [Section 19.1.6, “Replication and Binary Logging Options and Variables”](replication-options.md "19.1.6 Replication and Binary Logging Options and Variables").
4. If the source cluster is already in use, you can create a
   backup of the source and load this onto the replica to cut
   down on the amount of time required for the replica to
   synchronize itself with the source. If the replica is also
   running NDB Cluster, this can be accomplished using the backup
   and restore procedure described in
   [Section 25.7.9, “NDB Cluster Backups With NDB Cluster Replication”](mysql-cluster-replication-backups.md "25.7.9 NDB Cluster Backups With NDB Cluster Replication").

   ```simple
   ndb-connectstring=management_host[:port]
   ```

   In the event that you are *not* using NDB
   Cluster on the replica, you can create a backup with this
   command on the source:

   ```terminal
   shellS> mysqldump --master-data=1
   ```

   Then import the resulting data dump onto the replica by
   copying the dump file over to it. After this, you can use the
   [**mysql**](mysql.md "6.5.1 mysql — The MySQL Command-Line Client") client to import the data from the
   dumpfile into the replica database as shown here, where
   *`dump_file`* is the name of the file
   that was generated using [**mysqldump**](mysqldump.md "6.5.4 mysqldump — A Database Backup Program") on the
   source, and *`db_name`* is the name of
   the database to be replicated:

   ```terminal
   shellR> mysql -u root -p db_name < dump_file
   ```

   For a complete list of options to use with
   [**mysqldump**](mysqldump.md "6.5.4 mysqldump — A Database Backup Program"), see [Section 6.5.4, “mysqldump — A Database Backup Program”](mysqldump.md "6.5.4 mysqldump — A Database Backup Program").

   Note

   If you copy the data to the replica in this fashion, make
   sure that you stop the replica from trying to connect to the
   source to begin replicating before all the data has been
   loaded. You can do this by starting the replica with the
   [`--skip-slave-start`](replication-options-replica.md#option_mysqld_skip-slave-start) option on
   the command line, by including
   `skip-slave-start` in the replica's
   `my.cnf` file, or beginning with NDB
   8.0.24, by setting the
   [`skip_slave_start`](replication-options-replica.md#sysvar_skip_slave_start) system
   variable. Beginning with NDB 8.0.26, use
   [`--skip-replica-start`](replication-options-replica.md#option_mysqld_skip-replica-start) or
   [`skip_replica_start`](replication-options-replica.md#sysvar_skip_replica_start) instead.
   Once the data loading has completed, follow the additional
   steps outlined in the next two sections.
5. Ensure that each MySQL server acting as a replication source
   is assigned a unique server ID, and has binary logging
   enabled, using the row-based format. (See
   [Section 19.2.1, “Replication Formats”](replication-formats.md "19.2.1 Replication Formats").) In addition, we
   strongly recommend enabling the
   [`replica_allow_batching`](mysql-cluster-options-variables.md#sysvar_replica_allow_batching) system
   variable (NDB 8.0.26 and later; prior to NDB 8.0.26, use
   [`slave_allow_batching`](mysql-cluster-options-variables.md#sysvar_slave_allow_batching)).
   Beginning with NDB 8.0.30, this is enabled by default.

   If you are using a release of NDB Cluster prior to NDB 8.0.30,
   you should also consider increasing the values used with the
   [`--ndb-batch-size`](mysql-cluster-options-variables.md#option_mysqld_ndb-batch-size) and
   [`--ndb-blob-write-batch-bytes`](mysql-cluster-options-variables.md#option_mysqld_ndb-blob-write-batch-bytes)
   options as well. In NDB 8.0.30 and later, use
   [`--ndb-replica-batch-size`](mysql-cluster-options-variables.md#sysvar_ndb_replica_batch_size) to set
   the batch size used for writes on the replica instead of
   `--ndb-batch-size`, and
   [`--ndb-replica-blob-write-batch-bytes`](mysql-cluster-options-variables.md#sysvar_ndb_replica_blob_write_batch_bytes)
   rather than `--ndb-blob-write-batch-bytes` to
   determine the batch size used by the replication applier for
   writing blob data. All of these options can be set either in
   the source server's `my.cnf` file, or
   on the command line when starting the source
   [**mysqld**](mysqld.md "6.3.1 mysqld — The MySQL Server") process. See
   [Section 25.7.6, “Starting NDB Cluster Replication (Single Replication Channel)”](mysql-cluster-replication-starting.md "25.7.6 Starting NDB Cluster Replication (Single Replication Channel)"), for more
   information.
