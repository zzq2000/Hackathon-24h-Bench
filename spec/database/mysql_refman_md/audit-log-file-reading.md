#### 8.4.5.6 Reading Audit Log Files

The audit log plugin supports functions that provide an SQL
interface for reading JSON-format audit log files. (This
capability does not apply to log files written in other
formats.)

When the audit log plugin initializes and is configured for JSON
logging, it uses the directory containing the current audit log
file as the location to search for readable audit log files. The
plugin determines the file location, base name, and suffix from
the value of the [`audit_log_file`](audit-log-reference.md#sysvar_audit_log_file)
system variable, then looks for files with names that match the
following pattern, where `[...]` indicates
optional file name parts:

```none
basename[.timestamp].suffix[.gz][[.pwd_id].enc]
```

If a file name ends with `.enc`, the file is
encrypted and reading its unencrypted contents requires a
decryption password obtained from the keyring. The audit log
plugin determines the keyring ID of the decryption password as
follows:

- If `.enc` is preceded by
  *`pwd_id`*, the keyring ID is
  `audit_log-pwd_id`.
- If `.enc` is not preceded by
  *`pwd_id`*, the file has an old name
  from before audit log encryption password history was
  implemented. The keyring ID is `audit_log`.

For more information about encrypted audit log files, see
[Encrypting Audit Log Files](audit-log-logging-configuration.md#audit-log-file-encryption "Encrypting Audit Log Files").

The plugin ignores files that have been renamed manually and do
not match the pattern, and files that were encrypted with a
password no longer available in the keyring. The plugin opens
each remaining candidate file, verifies that the file actually
contains [`JSON`](json.md "13.5 The JSON Data Type") audit events, and
sorts the files using the timestamps from the first event of
each file. The result is a sequence of files that are subject to
access using the log-reading functions:

- [`audit_log_read()`](audit-log-reference.md#function_audit-log-read) reads events
  from the audit log or closes the reading process.
- [`audit_log_read_bookmark()`](audit-log-reference.md#function_audit-log-read-bookmark)
  returns a bookmark for the most recently written audit log
  event. This bookmark is suitable for passing to
  [`audit_log_read()`](audit-log-reference.md#function_audit-log-read) to indicate
  where to begin reading.

[`audit_log_read()`](audit-log-reference.md#function_audit-log-read) takes an
optional [`JSON`](json.md "13.5 The JSON Data Type") string argument,
and the result returned from a successful call to either
function is a [`JSON`](json.md "13.5 The JSON Data Type") string.

To use the functions to read the audit log, follow these
principles:

- Call [`audit_log_read()`](audit-log-reference.md#function_audit-log-read) to read
  events beginning from a given position or the current
  position, or to close reading:

  - To initialize an audit log read sequence, pass an
    argument that indicates the position at which to begin.
    One way to do so is to pass the bookmark returned by
    [`audit_log_read_bookmark()`](audit-log-reference.md#function_audit-log-read-bookmark):

    ```sql
    SELECT audit_log_read(audit_log_read_bookmark());
    ```
  - To continue reading from the current position in the
    sequence, call
    [`audit_log_read()`](audit-log-reference.md#function_audit-log-read) with no
    position specified:

    ```sql
    SELECT audit_log_read();
    ```
  - To explicitly close the read sequence, pass a
    [`JSON`](json.md "13.5 The JSON Data Type")
    `null` argument:

    ```sql
    SELECT audit_log_read('null');
    ```

    It is unnecessary to close reading explicitly. Reading
    is closed implicitly when the session ends or a new read
    sequence is initialized by calling
    [`audit_log_read()`](audit-log-reference.md#function_audit-log-read) with an
    argument that indicates the position at which to begin.
- A successful call to
  [`audit_log_read()`](audit-log-reference.md#function_audit-log-read) to read
  events returns a [`JSON`](json.md "13.5 The JSON Data Type") string
  containing an array of audit events:

  - If the final value of the returned array is not a
    [`JSON`](json.md "13.5 The JSON Data Type")
    `null` value, there are more events
    following those just read and
    [`audit_log_read()`](audit-log-reference.md#function_audit-log-read) can be
    called again to read more of them.
  - If the final value of the returned array is a
    [`JSON`](json.md "13.5 The JSON Data Type")
    `null` value, there are no more events
    left to be read in the current read sequence.

  Each non-`null` array element is an event
  represented as a [`JSON`](json.md "13.5 The JSON Data Type") hash.
  For example:

  ```json
  [
    {
      "timestamp": "2020-05-18 13:39:33", "id": 0,
      "class": "connection", "event": "connect",
      ...
    },
    {
      "timestamp": "2020-05-18 13:39:33", "id": 1,
      "class": "general", "event": "status",
      ...
    },
    {
      "timestamp": "2020-05-18 13:39:33", "id": 2,
      "class": "connection", "event": "disconnect",
      ...
    },
    null
  ]
  ```

  For more information about the content of JSON-format audit
  events, see [JSON Audit Log File Format](audit-log-file-formats.md#audit-log-file-json-format "JSON Audit Log File Format").
- An [`audit_log_read()`](audit-log-reference.md#function_audit-log-read) call to
  read events that does not specify a position produces an
  error under any of these conditions:

  - A read sequence has not yet been initialized by passing
    a position to
    [`audit_log_read()`](audit-log-reference.md#function_audit-log-read).
  - There are no more events left to be read in the current
    read sequence; that is,
    [`audit_log_read()`](audit-log-reference.md#function_audit-log-read)
    previously returned an array ending with a
    [`JSON`](json.md "13.5 The JSON Data Type")
    `null` value.
  - The most recent read sequence has been closed by passing
    a [`JSON`](json.md "13.5 The JSON Data Type")
    `null` value to
    [`audit_log_read()`](audit-log-reference.md#function_audit-log-read).

  To read events under those conditions, it is necessary to
  first initialize a read sequence by calling
  [`audit_log_read()`](audit-log-reference.md#function_audit-log-read) with an
  argument that specifies a position.

To specify a position to
[`audit_log_read()`](audit-log-reference.md#function_audit-log-read), include an
argument that indicates where to begin reading. For example,
pass a bookmark, which is a [`JSON`](json.md "13.5 The JSON Data Type")
hash containing `timestamp` and
`id` elements that uniquely identify a
particular event. Here is an example bookmark, obtained by
calling the
[`audit_log_read_bookmark()`](audit-log-reference.md#function_audit-log-read-bookmark)
function:

```sql
mysql> SELECT audit_log_read_bookmark();
+-------------------------------------------------+
| audit_log_read_bookmark()                       |
+-------------------------------------------------+
| { "timestamp": "2020-05-18 21:03:44", "id": 0 } |
+-------------------------------------------------+
```

Passing the current bookmark to
[`audit_log_read()`](audit-log-reference.md#function_audit-log-read) initializes
event reading beginning at the bookmark position:

```sql
mysql> SELECT audit_log_read(audit_log_read_bookmark());
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
| audit_log_read(audit_log_read_bookmark())                             |
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
| [ {"timestamp":"2020-05-18 22:41:24","id":0,"class":"connection", ... |
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
```

The argument to [`audit_log_read()`](audit-log-reference.md#function_audit-log-read)
is optional. If present, it can be a
[`JSON`](json.md "13.5 The JSON Data Type") `null`
value to close the read sequence, or a
[`JSON`](json.md "13.5 The JSON Data Type") hash.

Within a hash argument to
[`audit_log_read()`](audit-log-reference.md#function_audit-log-read), items are
optional and control aspects of the read operation such as the
position at which to begin reading or how many events to read.
The following items are significant (other items are ignored):

- `start`: The position within the audit log
  of the first event to read. The position is given as a
  timestamp and the read starts from the first event that
  occurs on or after the timestamp value. The
  `start` item has this format, where
  *`value`* is a literal timestamp
  value:

  ```json
  "start": { "timestamp": "value" }
  ```

  The `start` item is permitted as of MySQL
  8.0.22.
- `timestamp`, `id`: The
  position within the audit log of the first event to read.
  The `timestamp` and `id`
  items together comprise a bookmark that uniquely identify a
  particular event. If an
  [`audit_log_read()`](audit-log-reference.md#function_audit-log-read) argument
  includes either item, it must include both to completely
  specify a position or an error occurs.
- `max_array_length`: The maximum number of
  events to read from the log. If this item is omitted, the
  default is to read to the end of the log or until the read
  buffer is full, whichever comes first.

To specify a starting position to
[`audit_log_read()`](audit-log-reference.md#function_audit-log-read), pass a hash
argument that includes either a `start` item or
a bookmark consisting of `timestamp` and
`id` items. If a hash argument includes both a
`start` item and a bookmark, an error occurs.

If a hash argument specifies no starting position, reading
continues from the current position.

If a timestamp value includes no time part, a time part of
`00:00:00` is assumed.

Example arguments accepted by
[`audit_log_read()`](audit-log-reference.md#function_audit-log-read):

- Read events starting with the first event that occurs on or
  after the given timestamp:

  ```sql
  audit_log_read('{ "start": { "timestamp": "2020-05-24 12:30:00" } }')
  ```
- Like the previous example, but read at most 3 events:

  ```sql
  audit_log_read('{ "start": { "timestamp": "2020-05-24 12:30:00" }, "max_array_length": 3 }')
  ```
- Read events starting with the first event that occurs on or
  after `2020-05-24 00:00:00` (the timestamp
  includes no time part, so `00:00:00` is
  assumed):

  ```sql
  audit_log_read('{ "start": { "timestamp": "2020-05-24" } }')
  ```
- Read events starting with the event that has the exact
  timestamp and event ID:

  ```sql
  audit_log_read('{ "timestamp": "2020-05-24 12:30:00", "id": 0 }')
  ```
- Like the previous example, but read at most 3 events:

  ```sql
  audit_log_read('{ "timestamp": "2020-05-24 12:30:00", "id": 0, "max_array_length": 3 }')
  ```
- Read events from the current position in the read sequence:

  ```sql
  audit_log_read()
  ```
- Read at most 5 events beginning at the current position in
  the read sequence:

  ```sql
  audit_log_read('{ "max_array_length": 5 }')
  ```
- Close the current read sequence:

  ```sql
  audit_log_read('null')
  ```

A [`JSON`](json.md "13.5 The JSON Data Type") string returned from
either log-reading function can be manipulated as necessary.
Suppose that a call to obtain a bookmark produces this value:

```sql
mysql> SET @mark := audit_log_read_bookmark();
mysql> SELECT @mark;
+-------------------------------------------------+
| @mark                                           |
+-------------------------------------------------+
| { "timestamp": "2020-05-18 16:10:28", "id": 2 } |
+-------------------------------------------------+
```

Calling [`audit_log_read()`](audit-log-reference.md#function_audit-log-read) with
that argument can return multiple events. To limit
[`audit_log_read()`](audit-log-reference.md#function_audit-log-read) to reading at
most *`N`* events, add to the string a
`max_array_length` item with that value. For
example, to read a single event, modify the string as follows:

```sql
mysql> SET @mark := JSON_SET(@mark, '$.max_array_length', 1);
mysql> SELECT @mark;
+----------------------------------------------------------------------+
| @mark                                                                |
+----------------------------------------------------------------------+
| {"id": 2, "timestamp": "2020-05-18 16:10:28", "max_array_length": 1} |
+----------------------------------------------------------------------+
```

The modified string, when passed to
[`audit_log_read()`](audit-log-reference.md#function_audit-log-read), produces a
result containing at most one event, no matter how many are
available.

Prior to MySQL 8.0.19, string return values from audit log
functions are binary strings. To use a binary string with
functions that require a nonbinary string (such as functions
that manipulate [`JSON`](json.md "13.5 The JSON Data Type") values),
convert it to a nonbinary string. For example, before passing a
bookmark to [`JSON_SET()`](json-modification-functions.md#function_json-set), convert
it to `utf8mb4` as follows:

```sql
SET @mark = CONVERT(@mark USING utf8mb4);
```

That statement can be used even for MySQL 8.0.19 and higher; for
those versions, it is essentially a no-op and is harmless.

If an audit log function is invoked from within the
[**mysql**](mysql.md "6.5.1 mysql — The MySQL Command-Line Client") client, binary string results display
using hexadecimal notation, depending on the value of the
[`--binary-as-hex`](mysql-command-options.md#option_mysql_binary-as-hex). For more
information about that option, see [Section 6.5.1, “mysql — The MySQL Command-Line Client”](mysql.md "6.5.1 mysql — The MySQL Command-Line Client").

To set a limit on the number of bytes that
[`audit_log_read()`](audit-log-reference.md#function_audit-log-read) reads, set the
[`audit_log_read_buffer_size`](audit-log-reference.md#sysvar_audit_log_read_buffer_size)
system variable. As of MySQL 8.0.12, this variable has a default
of 32KB and can be set at runtime. Each client should set its
session value of
[`audit_log_read_buffer_size`](audit-log-reference.md#sysvar_audit_log_read_buffer_size)
appropriately for its use of
[`audit_log_read()`](audit-log-reference.md#function_audit-log-read).

Each call to [`audit_log_read()`](audit-log-reference.md#function_audit-log-read)
returns as many available events as fit within the buffer size.
Events that do not fit within the buffer size are skipped and
generate warnings. Given this behavior, consider these factors
when assessing the proper buffer size for an application:

- There is a tradeoff between number of calls to
  [`audit_log_read()`](audit-log-reference.md#function_audit-log-read) and events
  returned per call:

  - With a smaller buffer size, calls return fewer events,
    so more calls are needed.
  - With a larger buffer size, calls return more events, so
    fewer calls are needed.
- With a smaller buffer size, such as the default size of
  32KB, there is a greater chance for events to exceed the
  buffer size and thus to be skipped.

Prior to MySQL 8.0.12,
[`audit_log_read_buffer_size`](audit-log-reference.md#sysvar_audit_log_read_buffer_size) has
a default of 1MB, affects all clients, and can be changed only
at server startup.
