#### 8.4.3.3 Transitioning to the Password Validation Component

Note

In MySQL 8.0, the
`validate_password` plugin was reimplemented
as the `validate_password` component. The
`validate_password` plugin is deprecated;
expect it to be removed in a future version of MySQL.

MySQL installations that currently use the
`validate_password` plugin should make the
transition to using the `validate_password`
component instead. To do so, use the following procedure. The
procedure installs the component before uninstalling the plugin,
to avoid having a time window during which no password
validation occurs. (The component and plugin can be installed
simultaneously. In this case, the server attempts to use the
component, falling back to the plugin if the component is
unavailable.)

1. Install the `validate_password` component:

   ```sql
   INSTALL COMPONENT 'file://component_validate_password';
   ```
2. Test the `validate_password` component to
   ensure that it works as expected. If you need to set any
   `validate_password.xxx`
   system variables, you can do so at runtime using
   `SET
   GLOBAL`. (Any option file changes that must be made
   are performed in the next step.)
3. Adjust any references to the plugin system and status
   variables to refer to the corresponding component system and
   status variables. Suppose that previously you had configured
   the plugin at startup using an option file like this:

   ```ini
   [mysqld]
   validate-password=FORCE_PLUS_PERMANENT
   validate_password_dictionary_file=/usr/share/dict/words
   validate_password_length=10
   validate_password_number_count=2
   ```

   Those settings are appropriate for the plugin, but must be
   modified to apply to the component. To adjust the option
   file, omit the
   [`--validate-password`](validate-password-options-variables.md#option_mysqld_validate-password) option
   (it applies only to the plugin, not the component), and
   modify the system variable references from no-dot names
   appropriate for the plugin to dotted names appropriate for
   the component:

   ```ini
   [mysqld]
   validate_password.dictionary_file=/usr/share/dict/words
   validate_password.length=10
   validate_password.number_count=2
   ```

   Similar adjustments are needed for applications that refer
   at runtime to `validate_password` plugin
   system and status variables. Change the no-dot plugin
   variable names to the corresponding dotted component
   variable names.
4. Uninstall the `validate_password` plugin:

   ```sql
   UNINSTALL PLUGIN validate_password;
   ```

   If the `validate_password` plugin is loaded
   at server startup using a
   [`--plugin-load`](server-options.md#option_mysqld_plugin-load) or
   [`--plugin-load-add`](server-options.md#option_mysqld_plugin-load-add) option,
   omit that option from the server startup procedure. For
   example, if the option is listed in a server option file,
   remove it from the file.
5. Restart the server.
