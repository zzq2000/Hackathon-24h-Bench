## 17.9 InnoDB Table and Page Compression

[17.9.1 InnoDB Table Compression](innodb-table-compression.md)

[17.9.2 InnoDB Page Compression](innodb-page-compression.md)

This section provides information about the
`InnoDB` table compression and
`InnoDB` page compression features. The page
compression feature is also referred to as
[transparent page
compression](glossary.md#glos_transparent_page_compression "transparent page compression").

Using the compression features of `InnoDB`, you can
create tables where the data is stored in compressed form.
Compression can help to improve both raw performance and
scalability. The compression means less data is transferred between
disk and memory, and takes up less space on disk and in memory. The
benefits are amplified for tables with
[secondary indexes](glossary.md#glos_secondary_index "secondary index"),
because index data is compressed also. Compression can be especially
important for [SSD](glossary.md#glos_ssd "SSD") storage devices,
because they tend to have lower capacity than
[HDD](glossary.md#glos_hdd "HDD") devices.
