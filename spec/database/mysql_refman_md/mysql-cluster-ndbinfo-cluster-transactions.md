#### 25.6.16.8 The ndbinfo cluster\_transactions Table

The `cluster_transactions` table shows
information about all ongoing transactions in an NDB Cluster.

The `cluster_transactions` table contains the
following columns:

- `node_id`

  Node ID of transaction coordinator
- `block_instance`

  TC block instance
- `transid`

  Transaction ID
- `state`

  Operation state (see text for possible values)
- `count_operations`

  Number of stateful primary key operations in transaction
  (includes reads with locks, as well as DML operations)
- `outstanding_operations`

  Operations still being executed in local data management
  blocks
- `inactive_seconds`

  Time spent waiting for API
- `client_node_id`

  Client node ID
- `client_block_ref`

  Client block reference

##### Notes

The transaction ID is a unique 64-bit number which can be
obtained using the NDB API's
[`getTransactionId()`](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/ndbapi/en/ndb-ndbtransaction.html#ndb-ndbtransaction-gettransactionid)
method. (Currently, the MySQL Server does not expose the NDB API
transaction ID of an ongoing transaction.)

`block_instance` refers to an instance of a
kernel block. Together with the block name, this number can be
used to look up a given instance in the
[`threadblocks`](mysql-cluster-ndbinfo-threadblocks.md "25.6.16.61 The ndbinfo threadblocks Table") table.

The `state` column can have any one of the
values `CS_ABORTING`,
`CS_COMMITTING`,
`CS_COMMIT_SENT`,
`CS_COMPLETE_SENT`,
`CS_COMPLETING`,
`CS_CONNECTED`,
`CS_DISCONNECTED`,
`CS_FAIL_ABORTED`,
`CS_FAIL_ABORTING`,
`CS_FAIL_COMMITTED`,
`CS_FAIL_COMMITTING`,
`CS_FAIL_COMPLETED`,
`CS_FAIL_PREPARED`,
`CS_PREPARE_TO_COMMIT`,
`CS_RECEIVING`,
`CS_REC_COMMITTING`,
`CS_RESTART`,
`CS_SEND_FIRE_TRIG_REQ`,
`CS_STARTED`,
`CS_START_COMMITTING`,
`CS_START_SCAN`,
`CS_WAIT_ABORT_CONF`,
`CS_WAIT_COMMIT_CONF`,
`CS_WAIT_COMPLETE_CONF`,
`CS_WAIT_FIRE_TRIG_REQ`. (If the MySQL Server
is running with
[`ndbinfo_show_hidden`](mysql-cluster-options-variables.md#sysvar_ndbinfo_show_hidden) enabled,
you can view this list of states by selecting from the
`ndb$dbtc_apiconnect_state` table, which is
normally hidden.)

In `client_node_id` and
`client_block_ref`, `client`
refers to an NDB Cluster API or SQL node (that is, an NDB API
client or a MySQL Server attached to the cluster).

The `tc_block_instance` column provides the
[`DBTC`](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/ndb-internals/en/ndb-internals-kernel-blocks-dbtc.html) block instance number.
You can use this along with the block name to obtain information
about specific threads from the
[`threadblocks`](mysql-cluster-ndbinfo-threadblocks.md "25.6.16.61 The ndbinfo threadblocks Table") table.
