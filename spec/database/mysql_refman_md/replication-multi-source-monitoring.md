#### 19.1.5.8 Monitoring Multi-Source Replication

To monitor the status of replication channels the following
options exist:

- Using the replication Performance Schema tables. The first
  column of these tables is `Channel_Name`.
  This enables you to write complex queries based on
  `Channel_Name` as a key. See
  [Section 29.12.11, “Performance Schema Replication Tables”](performance-schema-replication-tables.md "29.12.11 Performance Schema Replication Tables").
- Using `SHOW REPLICA
  STATUS FOR CHANNEL
  channel`. By default, if
  the `FOR CHANNEL
  channel` clause is not
  used, this statement shows the replica status for all channels
  with one row per channel. The identifier
  `Channel_name` is added as a column in the
  result set. If a `FOR CHANNEL
  channel` clause is
  provided, the results show the status of only the named
  replication channel.

Note

The [`SHOW VARIABLES`](show-variables.md "15.7.7.41 SHOW VARIABLES Statement") statement does
not work with multiple replication channels. The information
that was available through these variables has been migrated to
the replication performance tables. Using a
[`SHOW VARIABLES`](show-variables.md "15.7.7.41 SHOW VARIABLES Statement") statement in a
topology with multiple channels shows the status of only the
default channel.

The error codes and messages that are issued when multi-source
replication is enabled specify the channel that generated the
error.

##### 19.1.5.8.1 Monitoring Channels Using Performance Schema Tables

This section explains how to use the replication Performance
Schema tables to monitor channels. You can choose to monitor all
channels, or a subset of the existing channels.

To monitor the connection status of all channels:

```sql
mysql> SELECT * FROM replication_connection_status\G;
*************************** 1. row ***************************
CHANNEL_NAME: source_1
GROUP_NAME:
SOURCE_UUID: 046e41f8-a223-11e4-a975-0811960cc264
THREAD_ID: 24
SERVICE_STATE: ON
COUNT_RECEIVED_HEARTBEATS: 0
LAST_HEARTBEAT_TIMESTAMP: 0000-00-00 00:00:00
RECEIVED_TRANSACTION_SET: 046e41f8-a223-11e4-a975-0811960cc264:4-37
LAST_ERROR_NUMBER: 0
LAST_ERROR_MESSAGE:
LAST_ERROR_TIMESTAMP: 0000-00-00 00:00:00
*************************** 2. row ***************************
CHANNEL_NAME: source_2
GROUP_NAME:
SOURCE_UUID: 7475e474-a223-11e4-a978-0811960cc264
THREAD_ID: 26
SERVICE_STATE: ON
COUNT_RECEIVED_HEARTBEATS: 0
LAST_HEARTBEAT_TIMESTAMP: 0000-00-00 00:00:00
RECEIVED_TRANSACTION_SET: 7475e474-a223-11e4-a978-0811960cc264:4-6
LAST_ERROR_NUMBER: 0
LAST_ERROR_MESSAGE:
LAST_ERROR_TIMESTAMP: 0000-00-00 00:00:00
2 rows in set (0.00 sec)
```

In the above output there are two channels enabled, and as shown
by the `CHANNEL_NAME` field they are called
`source_1` and `source_2`.

The addition of the `CHANNEL_NAME` field
enables you to query the Performance Schema tables for a
specific channel. To monitor the connection status of a named
channel, use a `WHERE
CHANNEL_NAME=channel`
clause:

```sql
mysql> SELECT * FROM replication_connection_status WHERE CHANNEL_NAME='source_1'\G
*************************** 1. row ***************************
CHANNEL_NAME: source_1
GROUP_NAME:
SOURCE_UUID: 046e41f8-a223-11e4-a975-0811960cc264
THREAD_ID: 24
SERVICE_STATE: ON
COUNT_RECEIVED_HEARTBEATS: 0
LAST_HEARTBEAT_TIMESTAMP: 0000-00-00 00:00:00
RECEIVED_TRANSACTION_SET: 046e41f8-a223-11e4-a975-0811960cc264:4-37
LAST_ERROR_NUMBER: 0
LAST_ERROR_MESSAGE:
LAST_ERROR_TIMESTAMP: 0000-00-00 00:00:00
1 row in set (0.00 sec)
```

Similarly, the `WHERE
CHANNEL_NAME=channel` clause
can be used to monitor the other replication Performance Schema
tables for a specific channel. For more information, see
[Section 29.12.11, “Performance Schema Replication Tables”](performance-schema-replication-tables.md "29.12.11 Performance Schema Replication Tables").
