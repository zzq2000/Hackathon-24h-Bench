## 9.3 Example Backup and Recovery Strategy

[9.3.1 Establishing a Backup Policy](backup-policy.md)

[9.3.2 Using Backups for Recovery](recovery-from-backups.md)

[9.3.3 Backup Strategy Summary](backup-strategy-summary.md)

This section discusses a procedure for performing backups that
enables you to recover data after several types of crashes:

- Operating system crash
- Power failure
- File system crash
- Hardware problem (hard drive, motherboard, and so forth)

The example commands do not include options such as
[`--user`](connection-options.md#option_general_user) and
[`--password`](connection-options.md#option_general_password) for the
[**mysqldump**](mysqldump.md "6.5.4 mysqldump — A Database Backup Program") and [**mysql**](mysql.md "6.5.1 mysql — The MySQL Command-Line Client") client
programs. You should include such options as necessary to enable
client programs to connect to the MySQL server.

Assume that data is stored in the `InnoDB`
storage engine, which has support for transactions and automatic
crash recovery. Assume also that the MySQL server is under load at
the time of the crash. If it were not, no recovery would ever be
needed.

For cases of operating system crashes or power failures, we can
assume that MySQL's disk data is available after a restart. The
`InnoDB` data files might not contain consistent
data due to the crash, but `InnoDB` reads its
logs and finds in them the list of pending committed and
noncommitted transactions that have not been flushed to the data
files. `InnoDB` automatically rolls back those
transactions that were not committed, and flushes to its data
files those that were committed. Information about this recovery
process is conveyed to the user through the MySQL error log. The
following is an example log excerpt:

```simple
InnoDB: Database was not shut down normally.
InnoDB: Starting recovery from log files...
InnoDB: Starting log scan based on checkpoint at
InnoDB: log sequence number 0 13674004
InnoDB: Doing recovery: scanned up to log sequence number 0 13739520
InnoDB: Doing recovery: scanned up to log sequence number 0 13805056
InnoDB: Doing recovery: scanned up to log sequence number 0 13870592
InnoDB: Doing recovery: scanned up to log sequence number 0 13936128
...
InnoDB: Doing recovery: scanned up to log sequence number 0 20555264
InnoDB: Doing recovery: scanned up to log sequence number 0 20620800
InnoDB: Doing recovery: scanned up to log sequence number 0 20664692
InnoDB: 1 uncommitted transaction(s) which must be rolled back
InnoDB: Starting rollback of uncommitted transactions
InnoDB: Rolling back trx no 16745
InnoDB: Rolling back of trx no 16745 completed
InnoDB: Rollback of uncommitted transactions completed
InnoDB: Starting an apply batch of log records to the database...
InnoDB: Apply batch completed
InnoDB: Started
mysqld: ready for connections
```

For the cases of file system crashes or hardware problems, we can
assume that the MySQL disk data is *not*
available after a restart. This means that MySQL fails to start
successfully because some blocks of disk data are no longer
readable. In this case, it is necessary to reformat the disk,
install a new one, or otherwise correct the underlying problem.
Then it is necessary to recover our MySQL data from backups, which
means that backups must already have been made. To make sure that
is the case, design and implement a backup policy.
