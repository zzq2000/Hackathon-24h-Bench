#### 15.6.4.1 Local Variable DECLARE Statement

```sql
DECLARE var_name [, var_name] ... type [DEFAULT value]
```

This statement declares local variables within stored programs.
To provide a default value for a variable, include a
`DEFAULT` clause. The value can be specified as
an expression; it need not be a constant. If the
`DEFAULT` clause is missing, the initial value
is `NULL`.

Local variables are treated like stored routine parameters with
respect to data type and overflow checking. See
[Section 15.1.17, “CREATE PROCEDURE and CREATE FUNCTION Statements”](create-procedure.md "15.1.17 CREATE PROCEDURE and CREATE FUNCTION Statements").

Variable declarations must appear before cursor or handler
declarations.

Local variable names are not case-sensitive. Permissible
characters and quoting rules are the same as for other
identifiers, as described in [Section 11.2, “Schema Object Names”](identifiers.md "11.2 Schema Object Names").

The scope of a local variable is the
[`BEGIN ...
END`](begin-end.md "15.6.1 BEGIN ... END Compound Statement") block within which it is declared. The variable
can be referred to in blocks nested within the declaring block,
except those blocks that declare a variable with the same name.

For examples of variable declarations, see
[Section 15.6.4.2, “Local Variable Scope and Resolution”](local-variable-scope.md "15.6.4.2 Local Variable Scope and Resolution").
