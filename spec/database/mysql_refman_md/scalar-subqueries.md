#### 15.2.15.1 The Subquery as Scalar Operand

In its simplest form, a subquery is a scalar subquery that
returns a single value. A scalar subquery is a simple operand,
and you can use it almost anywhere a single column value or
literal is legal, and you can expect it to have those
characteristics that all operands have: a data type, a length,
an indication that it can be `NULL`, and so on.
For example:

```sql
CREATE TABLE t1 (s1 INT, s2 CHAR(5) NOT NULL);
INSERT INTO t1 VALUES(100, 'abcde');
SELECT (SELECT s2 FROM t1);
```

The subquery in this [`SELECT`](select.md "15.2.13 SELECT Statement")
returns a single value (`'abcde'`) that has a
data type of [`CHAR`](char.md "13.3.2 The CHAR and VARCHAR Types"), a length of 5,
a character set and collation equal to the defaults in effect at
[`CREATE TABLE`](create-table.md "15.1.20 CREATE TABLE Statement") time, and an
indication that the value in the column can be
`NULL`. Nullability of the value selected by a
scalar subquery is not copied because if the subquery result is
empty, the result is `NULL`. For the subquery
just shown, if `t1` were empty, the result
would be `NULL` even though
`s2` is `NOT NULL`.

There are a few contexts in which a scalar subquery cannot be
used. If a statement permits only a literal value, you cannot
use a subquery. For example, `LIMIT` requires
literal integer arguments, and [`LOAD
DATA`](load-data.md "15.2.9 LOAD DATA Statement") requires a literal string file name. You cannot
use subqueries to supply these values.

When you see examples in the following sections that contain the
rather spartan construct `(SELECT column1 FROM
t1)`, imagine that your own code contains much more
diverse and complex constructions.

Suppose that we make two tables:

```sql
CREATE TABLE t1 (s1 INT);
INSERT INTO t1 VALUES (1);
CREATE TABLE t2 (s1 INT);
INSERT INTO t2 VALUES (2);
```

Then perform a [`SELECT`](select.md "15.2.13 SELECT Statement"):

```sql
SELECT (SELECT s1 FROM t2) FROM t1;
```

The result is `2` because there is a row in
`t2` containing a column `s1`
that has a value of `2`.

In MySQL 8.0.19 and later, the preceding query can also be
written like this, using [`TABLE`](table.md "15.2.16 TABLE Statement"):

```sql
SELECT (TABLE t2) FROM t1;
```

A scalar subquery can be part of an expression, but remember the
parentheses, even if the subquery is an operand that provides an
argument for a function. For example:

```sql
SELECT UPPER((SELECT s1 FROM t1)) FROM t2;
```

The same result can be obtained in MySQL 8.0.19 and later using
`SELECT UPPER((TABLE t1)) FROM t2`.
