#### 7.9.1.3 Using WER with PDB to create a Windows crashdump

Program Database files (with suffix `pdb`)
are included in the **ZIP Archive Debug
Binaries & Test Suite** distribution of MySQL.
These files provide information for debugging your MySQL
installation in the event of a problem. This is a separate
download from the standard MSI or Zip file.

Note

The PDB files are available in a separate file labeled "ZIP
Archive Debug Binaries & Test Suite".

The PDB file contains more detailed information about
`mysqld` and other tools that enables more
detailed trace and dump files to be created. You can use these
with **WinDbg** or Visual Studio to debug
[**mysqld**](mysqld.md "6.3.1 mysqld — The MySQL Server").

For more information on PDB files and the debugging options
available, see
[Debugging
Tools for Windows](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/drivers/debugger/).

To use WinDbg, either install the full Windows Driver Kit (WDK)
or install the standalone version.

Important

The `.exe` and `.pdb`
files must be an exact match (both version number and MySQL
server edition); otherwise, or WinDBG complains while
attempting to load the symbols.

1. To generate a minidump `mysqld.dmp`,
   enable the [`core-file`](server-options.md#option_mysqld_core-file) option
   under the [mysqld] section in `my.ini`.
   Restart the MySQL server after making these changes.
2. Create a directory to store the generated files, such as
   `c:\symbols`
3. Determine the path to your **windbg.exe**
   executable using the Find GUI or from the command line, for
   example: `dir /s /b windbg.exe` -- a common
   default is *C:\Program Files\Debugging Tools for
   Windows (x64)\windbg.exe*
4. Launch `windbg.exe` giving it the paths
   to `mysqld.exe`,
   `mysqld.pdb`,
   `mysqld.dmp`, and the source code.
   Alternatively, pass in each path from the WinDbg GUI. For
   example:

   ```terminal
   windbg.exe -i "C:\mysql-8.0.45-winx64\bin\"^
    -z "C:\mysql-8.0.45-winx64\data\mysqld.dmp"^
    -srcpath "E:\ade\mysql_archives\8.0\8.0.45\mysql-8.0.45"^
    -y "C:\mysql-8.0.45-winx64\bin;SRV*c:\symbols*http://msdl.microsoft.com/download/symbols"^
    -v -n -c "!analyze -vvvvv"
   ```

   Note

   The `^` character and newline are removed
   by the Windows command line processor, so be sure the
   spaces remain intact.
