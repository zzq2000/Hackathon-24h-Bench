## 3.8 Upgrading MySQL with the MySQL Yum Repository

For supported Yum-based platforms (see
[Section 2.5.1, “Installing MySQL on Linux Using the MySQL Yum Repository”](linux-installation-yum-repo.md "2.5.1 Installing MySQL on Linux Using the MySQL Yum Repository"), for a list), you
can perform an in-place upgrade for MySQL (that is, replacing the
old version and then running the new version using the old data
files) with the MySQL Yum repository.

Notes

- Before performing any update to MySQL, follow carefully the
  instructions in [Chapter 3, *Upgrading MySQL*](upgrading.md "Chapter 3 Upgrading MySQL"). Among other
  instructions discussed there, it is especially important to
  back up your database before the update.
- The following instructions assume you have installed MySQL
  with the MySQL Yum repository or with an RPM package
  directly downloaded from
  [MySQL Developer Zone's
  MySQL Download page](https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/); if that is not the case,
  following the instructions in
  [Replacing a Third-Party Distribution of MySQL Using the MySQL Yum Repository](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/replace-third-party-yum.html).

1. ### Selecting a Target Series

   By default, the MySQL Yum repository updates MySQL to the
   latest version in the release series you have chosen during
   installation (see [Selecting a Release Series](linux-installation-yum-repo.md#yum-repo-select-series "Selecting a Release Series") for
   details), which means, for example, a 5.7.x
   installation is *not* updated to a
   8.0.x release automatically. To update to another
   release series, you must first disable the subrepository for
   the series that has been selected (by default, or by yourself)
   and enable the subrepository for your target series. To do
   that, see the general instructions given in
   [Selecting a Release Series](linux-installation-yum-repo.md#yum-repo-select-series "Selecting a Release Series"). For upgrading from
   MySQL 5.7 to 8.0, perform the
   *reverse* of the steps illustrated in
   [Selecting a Release Series](linux-installation-yum-repo.md#yum-repo-select-series "Selecting a Release Series"), disabling the
   subrepository for the MySQL 5.7 series and
   enabling that for the MySQL 8.0 series.

   As a general rule, to upgrade from one release series to
   another, go to the next series rather than skipping a series.
   For example, if you are currently running MySQL 5.6 and wish
   to upgrade to 8.0, upgrade to MySQL
   5.7 first before upgrading to 8.0.

   Important

   For important information about upgrading from MySQL
   5.7 to 8.0, see
   [Upgrading
   from MySQL 5.7 to 8.0](upgrading-from-previous-series.md "3.5 Changes in MySQL 8.0").
2. ### Upgrading MySQL

   Upgrade MySQL and its components by the following command, for
   platforms that are not dnf-enabled:

   ```terminal
   sudo yum update mysql-server
   ```

   For platforms that are dnf-enabled:

   ```terminal
   sudo dnf upgrade mysql-server
   ```

   Alternatively, you can update MySQL by telling Yum to update
   everything on your system, which might take considerably more
   time. For platforms that are not dnf-enabled:

   ```terminal
   sudo yum update
   ```

   For platforms that are dnf-enabled:

   ```terminal
   sudo dnf upgrade
   ```
3. ### Restarting MySQL

   The MySQL server always restarts after an update by Yum. Prior
   to MySQL 8.0.16, run [**mysql\_upgrade**](mysql-upgrade.md "6.4.5 mysql_upgrade — Check and Upgrade MySQL Tables") after
   the server restarts to check and possibly resolve any
   incompatibilities between the old data and the upgraded
   software. [**mysql\_upgrade**](mysql-upgrade.md "6.4.5 mysql_upgrade — Check and Upgrade MySQL Tables") also performs other
   functions; for details, see [Section 6.4.5, “mysql\_upgrade — Check and Upgrade MySQL Tables”](mysql-upgrade.md "6.4.5 mysql_upgrade — Check and Upgrade MySQL Tables").
   As of MySQL 8.0.16, this step is not required, as the server
   performs all tasks previously handled by
   [**mysql\_upgrade**](mysql-upgrade.md "6.4.5 mysql_upgrade — Check and Upgrade MySQL Tables").

You can also update only a specific component. Use the following
command to list all the installed packages for the MySQL
components (for dnf-enabled systems, replace
**yum** in the command with
**dnf**):

```terminal
sudo yum list installed | grep "^mysql"
```

After identifying the package name of the component of your
choice, update the package with the following command, replacing
*`package-name`* with the name of the
package. For platforms that are not dnf-enabled:

```terminal
sudo yum update package-name
```

For dnf-enabled platforms:

```terminal
sudo dnf upgrade package-name
```

### Upgrading the Shared Client Libraries

After updating MySQL using the Yum repository, applications
compiled with older versions of the shared client libraries should
continue to work.

*If you recompile applications and dynamically link them
with the updated libraries:*  As typical with new
versions of shared libraries where there are differences or
additions in symbol versioning between the newer and older
libraries (for example, between the newer, standard
8.0 shared client libraries and some
older—prior or variant—versions of the shared
libraries shipped natively by the Linux distributions' software
repositories, or from some other sources), any applications
compiled using the updated, newer shared libraries require those
updated libraries on systems where the applications are deployed.
As expected, if those libraries are not in place, the applications
requiring the shared libraries fail. For this reason, be sure to
deploy the packages for the shared libraries from MySQL on those
systems. To do this, add the MySQL Yum repository to the systems
(see [Adding the MySQL Yum Repository](linux-installation-yum-repo.md#yum-repo-setup "Adding the MySQL Yum Repository")) and install the latest
shared libraries using the instructions given in
[Installing Additional MySQL Products and Components with Yum](linux-installation-yum-repo.md#yum-install-components "Installing Additional MySQL Products and Components with Yum").
