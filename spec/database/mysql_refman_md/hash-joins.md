#### 10.2.1.4 Hash Join Optimization

By default, MySQL (8.0.18 and later) employs hash joins
whenever possible. It is possible to control whether hash
joins are employed using one of the
[`BNL`](optimizer-hints.md#optimizer-hints-table-level "Table-Level Optimizer Hints") and
[`NO_BNL`](optimizer-hints.md#optimizer-hints-table-level "Table-Level Optimizer Hints") optimizer hints, or
by setting
[`block_nested_loop=on`](switchable-optimizations.md#optflag_block-nested-loop) or
`block_nested_loop=off` as part of the
setting for the optimizer\_switch server system variable.

Note

MySQL 8.0.18 supported setting a
[`hash_join`](switchable-optimizations.md#optflag_hash-join) flag in
[`optimizer_switch`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_optimizer_switch), as well
as the optimizer hints
[`HASH_JOIN`](optimizer-hints.md#optimizer-hints-table-level "Table-Level Optimizer Hints") and
`NO_HASH_JOIN`. In MySQL 8.0.19 and later,
none of these have any effect any longer.

Beginning with MySQL 8.0.18, MySQL employs a hash join for any
query for which each join has an equi-join condition, and in
which there are no indexes that can be applied to any join
conditions, such as this one:

```sql
SELECT *
    FROM t1
    JOIN t2
        ON t1.c1=t2.c1;
```

A hash join can also be used when there are one or more
indexes that can be used for single-table predicates.

A hash join is usually faster than and is intended to be used
in such cases instead of the block nested loop algorithm (see
[Block Nested-Loop Join Algorithm](nested-loop-joins.md#block-nested-loop-join-algorithm "Block Nested-Loop Join Algorithm")) employed
in previous versions of MySQL. Beginning with MySQL 8.0.20,
support for block nested loop is removed, and the server
employs a hash join wherever a block nested loop would have
been used previously.

In the example just shown and the remaining examples in this
section, we assume that the three tables
`t1`, `t2`, and
`t3` have been created using the following
statements:

```sql
CREATE TABLE t1 (c1 INT, c2 INT);
CREATE TABLE t2 (c1 INT, c2 INT);
CREATE TABLE t3 (c1 INT, c2 INT);
```

You can see that a hash join is being employed by using
[`EXPLAIN`](explain.md "15.8.2 EXPLAIN Statement"),
like this:

```sql
mysql> EXPLAIN
    -> SELECT * FROM t1
    ->     JOIN t2 ON t1.c1=t2.c1\G
*************************** 1. row ***************************
           id: 1
  select_type: SIMPLE
        table: t1
   partitions: NULL
         type: ALL
possible_keys: NULL
          key: NULL
      key_len: NULL
          ref: NULL
         rows: 1
     filtered: 100.00
        Extra: NULL
*************************** 2. row ***************************
           id: 1
  select_type: SIMPLE
        table: t2
   partitions: NULL
         type: ALL
possible_keys: NULL
          key: NULL
      key_len: NULL
          ref: NULL
         rows: 1
     filtered: 100.00
        Extra: Using where; Using join buffer (hash join)
```

(Prior to MySQL 8.0.20, it was necessary to include the
`FORMAT=TREE` option to see whether hash
joins were being used for a given join.)

[`EXPLAIN ANALYZE`](explain.md#explain-analyze "Obtaining Information with EXPLAIN ANALYZE") also displays
information about hash joins used.

The hash join is used for queries involving multiple joins as
well, as long as at least one join condition for each pair of
tables is an equi-join, like the query shown here:

```sql
SELECT * FROM t1
    JOIN t2 ON (t1.c1 = t2.c1 AND t1.c2 < t2.c2)
    JOIN t3 ON (t2.c1 = t3.c1);
```

In cases like the one just shown, which makes use of an inner
join, any extra conditions which are not equi-joins are
applied as filters after the join is executed. (For outer
joins, such as left joins, semijoins, and antijoins, they are
printed as part of the join.) This can be seen here in the
output of `EXPLAIN`:

```sql
mysql> EXPLAIN FORMAT=TREE
    -> SELECT *
    ->     FROM t1
    ->     JOIN t2
    ->         ON (t1.c1 = t2.c1 AND t1.c2 < t2.c2)
    ->     JOIN t3
    ->         ON (t2.c1 = t3.c1)\G
*************************** 1. row ***************************
EXPLAIN: -> Inner hash join (t3.c1 = t1.c1)  (cost=1.05 rows=1)
    -> Table scan on t3  (cost=0.35 rows=1)
    -> Hash
        -> Filter: (t1.c2 < t2.c2)  (cost=0.70 rows=1)
            -> Inner hash join (t2.c1 = t1.c1)  (cost=0.70 rows=1)
                -> Table scan on t2  (cost=0.35 rows=1)
                -> Hash
                    -> Table scan on t1  (cost=0.35 rows=1)
```

As also can be seen from the output just shown, multiple hash
joins can be (and are) used for joins having multiple
equi-join conditions.

Prior to MySQL 8.0.20, a hash join could not be used if any
pair of joined tables did not have at least one equi-join
condition, and the slower block nested loop algorithm was
employed. In MySQL 8.0.20 and later, the hash join is used in
such cases, as shown here:

```sql
mysql> EXPLAIN FORMAT=TREE
    -> SELECT * FROM t1
    ->     JOIN t2 ON (t1.c1 = t2.c1)
    ->     JOIN t3 ON (t2.c1 < t3.c1)\G
*************************** 1. row ***************************
EXPLAIN: -> Filter: (t1.c1 < t3.c1)  (cost=1.05 rows=1)
    -> Inner hash join (no condition)  (cost=1.05 rows=1)
        -> Table scan on t3  (cost=0.35 rows=1)
        -> Hash
            -> Inner hash join (t2.c1 = t1.c1)  (cost=0.70 rows=1)
                -> Table scan on t2  (cost=0.35 rows=1)
                -> Hash
                    -> Table scan on t1  (cost=0.35 rows=1)
```

(Additional examples are provided later in this section.)

A hash join is also applied for a Cartesian product—that
is, when no join condition is specified, as shown here:

```sql
mysql> EXPLAIN FORMAT=TREE
    -> SELECT *
    ->     FROM t1
    ->     JOIN t2
    ->     WHERE t1.c2 > 50\G
*************************** 1. row ***************************
EXPLAIN: -> Inner hash join  (cost=0.70 rows=1)
    -> Table scan on t2  (cost=0.35 rows=1)
    -> Hash
        -> Filter: (t1.c2 > 50)  (cost=0.35 rows=1)
            -> Table scan on t1  (cost=0.35 rows=1)
```

In MySQL 8.0.20 and later, it is no longer necessary for the
join to contain at least one equi-join condition in order for
a hash join to be used. This means that the types of queries
which can be optimized using hash joins include those in the
following list (with examples):

- *Inner non-equi-join*:

  ```sql
  mysql> EXPLAIN FORMAT=TREE SELECT * FROM t1 JOIN t2 ON t1.c1 < t2.c1\G
  *************************** 1. row ***************************
  EXPLAIN: -> Filter: (t1.c1 < t2.c1)  (cost=4.70 rows=12)
      -> Inner hash join (no condition)  (cost=4.70 rows=12)
          -> Table scan on t2  (cost=0.08 rows=6)
          -> Hash
              -> Table scan on t1  (cost=0.85 rows=6)
  ```
- *Semijoin*:

  ```sql
  mysql> EXPLAIN FORMAT=TREE SELECT * FROM t1
      ->     WHERE t1.c1 IN (SELECT t2.c2 FROM t2)\G
  *************************** 1. row ***************************
  EXPLAIN: -> Hash semijoin (t2.c2 = t1.c1)  (cost=0.70 rows=1)
      -> Table scan on t1  (cost=0.35 rows=1)
      -> Hash
          -> Table scan on t2  (cost=0.35 rows=1)
  ```
- *Antijoin*:

  ```sql
  mysql> EXPLAIN FORMAT=TREE SELECT * FROM t2
      ->     WHERE NOT EXISTS (SELECT * FROM t1 WHERE t1.c1 = t2.c1)\G
  *************************** 1. row ***************************
  EXPLAIN: -> Hash antijoin (t1.c1 = t2.c1)  (cost=0.70 rows=1)
      -> Table scan on t2  (cost=0.35 rows=1)
      -> Hash
          -> Table scan on t1  (cost=0.35 rows=1)

  1 row in set, 1 warning (0.00 sec)

  mysql> SHOW WARNINGS\G
  *************************** 1. row ***************************
    Level: Note
     Code: 1276
  Message: Field or reference 't3.t2.c1' of SELECT #2 was resolved in SELECT #1
  ```
- *Left outer join*:

  ```sql
  mysql> EXPLAIN FORMAT=TREE SELECT * FROM t1 LEFT JOIN t2 ON t1.c1 = t2.c1\G
  *************************** 1. row ***************************
  EXPLAIN: -> Left hash join (t2.c1 = t1.c1)  (cost=0.70 rows=1)
      -> Table scan on t1  (cost=0.35 rows=1)
      -> Hash
          -> Table scan on t2  (cost=0.35 rows=1)
  ```
- *Right outer join* (observe that MySQL
  rewrites all right outer joins as left outer joins):

  ```sql
  mysql> EXPLAIN FORMAT=TREE SELECT * FROM t1 RIGHT JOIN t2 ON t1.c1 = t2.c1\G
  *************************** 1. row ***************************
  EXPLAIN: -> Left hash join (t1.c1 = t2.c1)  (cost=0.70 rows=1)
      -> Table scan on t2  (cost=0.35 rows=1)
      -> Hash
          -> Table scan on t1  (cost=0.35 rows=1)
  ```

By default, MySQL 8.0.18 and later employs hash joins whenever
possible. It is possible to control whether hash joins are
employed using one of the
[`BNL`](optimizer-hints.md#optimizer-hints-table-level "Table-Level Optimizer Hints") and
`NO_BNL` optimizer hints.

(MySQL 8.0.18 supported
[`hash_join=on`](switchable-optimizations.md#optflag_hash-join) or
[`hash_join=off`](switchable-optimizations.md#optflag_hash-join) as part of the
setting for the
[`optimizer_switch`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_optimizer_switch) server
system variable as well as the optimizer hints
[`HASH_JOIN`](optimizer-hints.md#optimizer-hints-table-level "Table-Level Optimizer Hints") or
[`NO_HASH_JOIN`](optimizer-hints.md#optimizer-hints-table-level "Table-Level Optimizer Hints"). In MySQL
8.0.19 and later, these no longer have any effect.)

Memory usage by hash joins can be controlled using the
[`join_buffer_size`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_join_buffer_size) system
variable; a hash join cannot use more memory than this amount.
When the memory required for a hash join exceeds the amount
available, MySQL handles this by using files on disk. If this
happens, you should be aware that the join may not succeed if
a hash join cannot fit into memory and it creates more files
than set for
[`open_files_limit`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_open_files_limit). To avoid
such problems, make either of the following changes:

- Increase `join_buffer_size` so that the
  hash join does not spill over to disk.
- Increase `open_files_limit`.

Beginning with MySQL 8.0.18, join buffers for hash joins are
allocated incrementally; thus, you can set
[`join_buffer_size`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_join_buffer_size) higher
without small queries allocating very large amounts of RAM,
but outer joins allocate the entire buffer. In MySQL 8.0.20
and later, hash joins are used for outer joins (including
antijoins and semijoins) as well, so this is no longer an
issue.
