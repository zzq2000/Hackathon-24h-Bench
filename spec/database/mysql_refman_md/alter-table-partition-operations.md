#### 15.1.9.1 ALTER TABLE Partition Operations

Partitioning-related clauses for [`ALTER
TABLE`](alter-table.md "15.1.9 ALTER TABLE Statement") can be used with partitioned tables for
repartitioning, to add, drop, discard, import, merge, and split
partitions, and to perform partitioning maintenance.

- Simply using a *`partition_options`*
  clause with [`ALTER TABLE`](alter-table.md "15.1.9 ALTER TABLE Statement") on a
  partitioned table repartitions the table according to the
  partitioning scheme defined by the
  *`partition_options`*. This clause
  always begins with `PARTITION BY`, and
  follows the same syntax and other rules as apply to the
  *`partition_options`* clause for
  [`CREATE TABLE`](create-table.md "15.1.20 CREATE TABLE Statement") (for more
  detailed information, see [Section 15.1.20, “CREATE TABLE Statement”](create-table.md "15.1.20 CREATE TABLE Statement")),
  and can also be used to partition an existing table that is
  not already partitioned. For example, consider a
  (nonpartitioned) table defined as shown here:

  ```sql
  CREATE TABLE t1 (
      id INT,
      year_col INT
  );
  ```

  This table can be partitioned by `HASH`,
  using the `id` column as the partitioning
  key, into 8 partitions by means of this statement:

  ```sql
  ALTER TABLE t1
      PARTITION BY HASH(id)
      PARTITIONS 8;
  ```

  MySQL supports an `ALGORITHM` option with
  `[SUB]PARTITION BY [LINEAR] KEY`.
  `ALGORITHM=1` causes the server to use the
  same key-hashing functions as MySQL 5.1 when computing the
  placement of rows in partitions;
  `ALGORITHM=2` means that the server employs
  the key-hashing functions implemented and used by default
  for new `KEY` partitioned tables in MySQL
  5.5 and later. (Partitioned tables created with the
  key-hashing functions employed in MySQL 5.5 and later cannot
  be used by a MySQL 5.1 server.) Not specifying the option
  has the same effect as using `ALGORITHM=2`.
  This option is intended for use chiefly when upgrading or
  downgrading `[LINEAR] KEY` partitioned
  tables between MySQL 5.1 and later MySQL versions, or for
  creating tables partitioned by `KEY` or
  `LINEAR KEY` on a MySQL 5.5 or later server
  which can be used on a MySQL 5.1 server.

  The table that results from using an `ALTER TABLE
  ... PARTITION BY` statement must follow the same
  rules as one created using `CREATE TABLE ...
  PARTITION BY`. This includes the rules governing
  the relationship between any unique keys (including any
  primary key) that the table might have, and the column or
  columns used in the partitioning expression, as discussed in
  [Section 26.6.1, “Partitioning Keys, Primary Keys, and Unique Keys”](partitioning-limitations-partitioning-keys-unique-keys.md "26.6.1 Partitioning Keys, Primary Keys, and Unique Keys").
  The `CREATE TABLE ... PARTITION BY` rules
  for specifying the number of partitions also apply to
  `ALTER TABLE ... PARTITION BY`.

  The *`partition_definition`* clause
  for `ALTER TABLE ADD PARTITION` supports
  the same options as the clause of the same name for the
  [`CREATE TABLE`](create-table.md "15.1.20 CREATE TABLE Statement") statement. (See
  [Section 15.1.20, “CREATE TABLE Statement”](create-table.md "15.1.20 CREATE TABLE Statement"), for the syntax and
  description.) Suppose that you have the partitioned table
  created as shown here:

  ```sql
  CREATE TABLE t1 (
      id INT,
      year_col INT
  )
  PARTITION BY RANGE (year_col) (
      PARTITION p0 VALUES LESS THAN (1991),
      PARTITION p1 VALUES LESS THAN (1995),
      PARTITION p2 VALUES LESS THAN (1999)
  );
  ```

  You can add a new partition `p3` to this
  table for storing values less than `2002`
  as follows:

  ```sql
  ALTER TABLE t1 ADD PARTITION (PARTITION p3 VALUES LESS THAN (2002));
  ```

  `DROP PARTITION` can be used to drop one or
  more `RANGE` or `LIST`
  partitions. This statement cannot be used with
  `HASH` or `KEY`
  partitions; instead, use `COALESCE
  PARTITION` (see later in this section). Any data
  that was stored in the dropped partitions named in the
  *`partition_names`* list is
  discarded. For example, given the table
  `t1` defined previously, you can drop the
  partitions named `p0` and
  `p1` as shown here:

  ```sql
  ALTER TABLE t1 DROP PARTITION p0, p1;
  ```

  Note

  `DROP PARTITION` does not work with
  tables that use the [`NDB`](mysql-cluster.md "Chapter 25 MySQL NDB Cluster 8.0")
  storage engine. See
  [Section 26.3.1, “Management of RANGE and LIST Partitions”](partitioning-management-range-list.md "26.3.1 Management of RANGE and LIST Partitions"), and
  [Section 25.2.7, “Known Limitations of NDB Cluster”](mysql-cluster-limitations.md "25.2.7 Known Limitations of NDB Cluster").

  `ADD PARTITION` and `DROP
  PARTITION` do not currently support `IF
  [NOT] EXISTS`.

  The [`DISCARD
  PARTITION ... TABLESPACE`](alter-table.md "15.1.9 ALTER TABLE Statement") and
  [`IMPORT
  PARTITION ... TABLESPACE`](alter-table.md "15.1.9 ALTER TABLE Statement") options extend the
  [Transportable
  Tablespace](glossary.md#glos_transportable_tablespace "transportable tablespace") feature to individual
  `InnoDB` table partitions. Each
  `InnoDB` table partition has its own
  tablespace file (`.ibd` file). The
  [Transportable
  Tablespace](glossary.md#glos_transportable_tablespace "transportable tablespace") feature makes it easy to copy the
  tablespaces from a running MySQL server instance to another
  running instance, or to perform a restore on the same
  instance. Both options take a comma-separated list of one or
  more partition names. For example:

  ```sql
  ALTER TABLE t1 DISCARD PARTITION p2, p3 TABLESPACE;
  ```

  ```sql
  ALTER TABLE t1 IMPORT PARTITION p2, p3 TABLESPACE;
  ```

  When running
  [`DISCARD
  PARTITION ... TABLESPACE`](alter-table.md "15.1.9 ALTER TABLE Statement") and
  [`IMPORT
  PARTITION ... TABLESPACE`](alter-table.md "15.1.9 ALTER TABLE Statement") on subpartitioned tables,
  both partition and subpartition names are allowed. When a
  partition name is specified, subpartitions of that partition
  are included.

  The
  [Transportable
  Tablespace](glossary.md#glos_transportable_tablespace "transportable tablespace") feature also supports copying or restoring
  partitioned `InnoDB` tables. For more
  information, see [Section 17.6.1.3, “Importing InnoDB Tables”](innodb-table-import.md "17.6.1.3 Importing InnoDB Tables").

  Renames of partitioned tables are supported. You can rename
  individual partitions indirectly using `ALTER TABLE
  ... REORGANIZE PARTITION`; however, this operation
  copies the partition's data.

  To delete rows from selected partitions, use the
  `TRUNCATE PARTITION` option. This option
  takes a list of one or more comma-separated partition names.
  Consider the table `t1` created by this
  statement:

  ```sql
  CREATE TABLE t1 (
      id INT,
      year_col INT
  )
  PARTITION BY RANGE (year_col) (
      PARTITION p0 VALUES LESS THAN (1991),
      PARTITION p1 VALUES LESS THAN (1995),
      PARTITION p2 VALUES LESS THAN (1999),
      PARTITION p3 VALUES LESS THAN (2003),
      PARTITION p4 VALUES LESS THAN (2007)
  );
  ```

  To delete all rows from partition `p0`, use
  the following statement:

  ```sql
  ALTER TABLE t1 TRUNCATE PARTITION p0;
  ```

  The statement just shown has the same effect as the
  following [`DELETE`](delete.md "15.2.2 DELETE Statement") statement:

  ```sql
  DELETE FROM t1 WHERE year_col < 1991;
  ```

  When truncating multiple partitions, the partitions do not
  have to be contiguous: This can greatly simplify delete
  operations on partitioned tables that would otherwise
  require very complex `WHERE` conditions if
  done with [`DELETE`](delete.md "15.2.2 DELETE Statement") statements.
  For example, this statement deletes all rows from partitions
  `p1` and `p3`:

  ```sql
  ALTER TABLE t1 TRUNCATE PARTITION p1, p3;
  ```

  An equivalent [`DELETE`](delete.md "15.2.2 DELETE Statement")
  statement is shown here:

  ```sql
  DELETE FROM t1 WHERE
      (year_col >= 1991 AND year_col < 1995)
      OR
      (year_col >= 2003 AND year_col < 2007);
  ```

  If you use the `ALL` keyword in place of
  the list of partition names, the statement acts on all table
  partitions.

  `TRUNCATE PARTITION` merely deletes rows;
  it does not alter the definition of the table itself, or of
  any of its partitions.

  To verify that the rows were dropped, check the
  `INFORMATION_SCHEMA.PARTITIONS` table,
  using a query such as this one:

  ```sql
  SELECT PARTITION_NAME, TABLE_ROWS
      FROM INFORMATION_SCHEMA.PARTITIONS
      WHERE TABLE_NAME = 't1';
  ```

  `COALESCE PARTITION` can be used with a
  table that is partitioned by `HASH` or
  `KEY` to reduce the number of partitions by
  *`number`*. Suppose that you have
  created table `t2` as follows:

  ```sql
  CREATE TABLE t2 (
      name VARCHAR (30),
      started DATE
  )
  PARTITION BY HASH( YEAR(started) )
  PARTITIONS 6;
  ```

  To reduce the number of partitions used by
  `t2` from 6 to 4, use the following
  statement:

  ```sql
  ALTER TABLE t2 COALESCE PARTITION 2;
  ```

  The data contained in the last
  *`number`* partitions is merged into
  the remaining partitions. In this case, partitions 4 and 5
  are merged into the first 4 partitions (the partitions
  numbered 0, 1, 2, and 3).

  To change some but not all the partitions used by a
  partitioned table, you can use `REORGANIZE
  PARTITION`. This statement can be used in several
  ways:

  - To merge a set of partitions into a single partition.
    This is done by naming several partitions in the
    *`partition_names`* list and
    supplying a single definition for
    *`partition_definition`*.
  - To split an existing partition into several partitions.
    Accomplish this by naming a single partition for
    *`partition_names`* and providing
    multiple
    *`partition_definitions`*.
  - To change the ranges for a subset of partitions defined
    using `VALUES LESS THAN` or the value
    lists for a subset of partitions defined using
    `VALUES IN`.

  Note

  For partitions that have not been explicitly named, MySQL
  automatically provides the default names
  `p0`, `p1`,
  `p2`, and so on. The same is true with
  regard to subpartitions.

  For more detailed information about and examples of
  `ALTER TABLE ... REORGANIZE PARTITION`
  statements, see
  [Section 26.3.1, “Management of RANGE and LIST Partitions”](partitioning-management-range-list.md "26.3.1 Management of RANGE and LIST Partitions").
- To exchange a table partition or subpartition with a table,
  use the `ALTER TABLE ... EXCHANGE
  PARTITION` statement—that is, to move any
  existing rows in the partition or subpartition to the
  nonpartitioned table, and any existing rows in the
  nonpartitioned table to the table partition or subpartition.

  Once one or more columns have been added to a partitioned
  table using `ALGORITHM=INSTANT`, it is no
  longer possible to exchange partitions with that table.

  For usage information and examples, see
  [Section 26.3.3, “Exchanging Partitions and Subpartitions with Tables”](partitioning-management-exchange.md "26.3.3 Exchanging Partitions and Subpartitions with Tables").
- Several options provide partition maintenance and repair
  functionality analogous to that implemented for
  nonpartitioned tables by statements such as
  [`CHECK TABLE`](check-table.md "15.7.3.2 CHECK TABLE Statement") and
  [`REPAIR TABLE`](repair-table.md "15.7.3.5 REPAIR TABLE Statement") (which are also
  supported for partitioned tables; for more information, see
  [Section 15.7.3, “Table Maintenance Statements”](table-maintenance-statements.md "15.7.3 Table Maintenance Statements")). These
  include `ANALYZE PARTITION`, `CHECK
  PARTITION`, `OPTIMIZE PARTITION`,
  `REBUILD PARTITION`, and `REPAIR
  PARTITION`. Each of these options takes a
  *`partition_names`* clause consisting
  of one or more names of partitions, separated by commas. The
  partitions must already exist in the target table. You can
  also use the `ALL` keyword in place of
  *`partition_names`*, in which case
  the statement acts on all table partitions. For more
  information and examples, see
  [Section 26.3.4, “Maintenance of Partitions”](partitioning-maintenance.md "26.3.4 Maintenance of Partitions").

  [`InnoDB`](innodb-storage-engine.md "Chapter 17 The InnoDB Storage Engine") does not currently
  support per-partition optimization; `ALTER TABLE ...
  OPTIMIZE PARTITION` causes the entire table to
  rebuilt and analyzed, and an appropriate warning to be
  issued. (Bug #11751825, Bug #42822) To work around this
  problem, use `ALTER TABLE ... REBUILD
  PARTITION` and `ALTER TABLE ... ANALYZE
  PARTITION` instead.

  The `ANALYZE PARTITION`, `CHECK
  PARTITION`, `OPTIMIZE PARTITION`,
  and `REPAIR PARTITION` options are not
  supported for tables which are not partitioned.
- `REMOVE PARTITIONING` enables you to remove
  a table's partitioning without otherwise affecting the
  table or its data. This option can be combined with other
  [`ALTER TABLE`](alter-table.md "15.1.9 ALTER TABLE Statement") options such as
  those used to add, drop, or rename columns or indexes.
- Using the `ENGINE` option with
  [`ALTER TABLE`](alter-table.md "15.1.9 ALTER TABLE Statement") changes the
  storage engine used by the table without affecting the
  partitioning. The target storage engine must provide its own
  partitioning handler. Only the `InnoDB` and
  `NDB` storage engines have native
  partitioning handlers; `NDB` is not
  currently supported in MySQL 8.0.

It is possible for an [`ALTER TABLE`](alter-table.md "15.1.9 ALTER TABLE Statement")
statement to contain a `PARTITION BY` or
`REMOVE PARTITIONING` clause in an addition to
other alter specifications, but the `PARTITION
BY` or `REMOVE PARTITIONING` clause
must be specified last after any other specifications.

The `ADD PARTITION`, `DROP
PARTITION`, `COALESCE PARTITION`,
`REORGANIZE PARTITION`, `ANALYZE
PARTITION`, `CHECK PARTITION`, and
`REPAIR PARTITION` options cannot be combined
with other alter specifications in a single `ALTER
TABLE`, since the options just listed act on individual
partitions. For more information, see
[Section 15.1.9.1, “ALTER TABLE Partition Operations”](alter-table-partition-operations.md "15.1.9.1 ALTER TABLE Partition Operations").

Only a single instance of any one of the following options can
be used in a given [`ALTER TABLE`](alter-table.md "15.1.9 ALTER TABLE Statement")
statement: `PARTITION BY`, `ADD
PARTITION`, `DROP PARTITION`,
`TRUNCATE PARTITION`, `EXCHANGE
PARTITION`, `REORGANIZE PARTITION`, or
`COALESCE PARTITION`, `ANALYZE
PARTITION`, `CHECK PARTITION`,
`OPTIMIZE PARTITION`, `REBUILD
PARTITION`, `REMOVE PARTITIONING`.

For example, the following two statements are invalid:

```sql
ALTER TABLE t1 ANALYZE PARTITION p1, ANALYZE PARTITION p2;

ALTER TABLE t1 ANALYZE PARTITION p1, CHECK PARTITION p2;
```

In the first case, you can analyze partitions
`p1` and `p2` of table
`t1` concurrently using a single statement with
a single `ANALYZE PARTITION` option that lists
both of the partitions to be analyzed, like this:

```sql
ALTER TABLE t1 ANALYZE PARTITION p1, p2;
```

In the second case, it is not possible to perform
`ANALYZE` and `CHECK`
operations on different partitions of the same table
concurrently. Instead, you must issue two separate statements,
like this:

```sql
ALTER TABLE t1 ANALYZE PARTITION p1;
ALTER TABLE t1 CHECK PARTITION p2;
```

`REBUILD` operations are currently unsupported
for subpartitions. The `REBUILD` keyword is
expressly disallowed with subpartitions, and causes
`ALTER TABLE` to fail with an error if so used.

`CHECK PARTITION` and `REPAIR
PARTITION` operations fail when the partition to be
checked or repaired contains any duplicate key errors.

For more information about these statements, see
[Section 26.3.4, “Maintenance of Partitions”](partitioning-maintenance.md "26.3.4 Maintenance of Partitions").
