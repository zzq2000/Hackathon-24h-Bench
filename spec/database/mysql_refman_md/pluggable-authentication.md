### 8.2.17 Pluggable Authentication

When a client connects to the MySQL server, the server uses the
user name provided by the client and the client host to select the
appropriate account row from the `mysql.user`
system table. The server then authenticates the client,
determining from the account row which authentication plugin
applies to the client:

- If the server cannot find the plugin, an error occurs and the
  connection attempt is rejected.
- Otherwise, the server invokes that plugin to authenticate the
  user, and the plugin returns a status to the server indicating
  whether the user provided the correct password and is
  permitted to connect.

Pluggable authentication enables these important capabilities:

- **Choice of authentication methods.**
  Pluggable authentication makes it easy for DBAs to choose
  and change the authentication method used for individual
  MySQL accounts.
- **External authentication.**
  Pluggable authentication makes it possible for clients to
  connect to the MySQL server with credentials appropriate for
  authentication methods that store credentials elsewhere than
  in the `mysql.user` system table. For
  example, plugins can be created to use external
  authentication methods such as PAM, Windows login IDs, LDAP,
  or Kerberos.
- **Proxy users:**
  If a user is permitted to connect, an authentication plugin
  can return to the server a user name different from the name
  of the connecting user, to indicate that the connecting user
  is a proxy for another user (the proxied user). While the
  connection lasts, the proxy user is treated, for purposes of
  access control, as having the privileges of the proxied
  user. In effect, one user impersonates another. For more
  information, see [Section 8.2.19, “Proxy Users”](proxy-users.md "8.2.19 Proxy Users").

Note

If you start the server with the
[`--skip-grant-tables`](server-options.md#option_mysqld_skip-grant-tables) option,
authentication plugins are not used even if loaded because the
server performs no client authentication and permits any client
to connect. Because this is insecure, if the server is started
with the [`--skip-grant-tables`](server-options.md#option_mysqld_skip-grant-tables)
option, it also disables remote connections by enabling
[`skip_networking`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_skip_networking).

#### Available Authentication Plugins

MySQL 8.0 provides these authentication plugins:

- A plugin that performs native authentication; that is,
  authentication based on the password hashing method in use
  from before the introduction of pluggable authentication in
  MySQL. The `mysql_native_password` plugin
  implements authentication based on this native password
  hashing method. See
  [Section 8.4.1.1, “Native Pluggable Authentication”](native-pluggable-authentication.md "8.4.1.1 Native Pluggable Authentication").

  Note

  As of MySQL 8.0.34, the
  `mysql_native_password` authentication
  plugin is deprecated and subject to removal in a future
  version of MySQL.
- Plugins that perform authentication using SHA-256 password
  hashing. This is stronger encryption than that available
  with native authentication. See
  [Section 8.4.1.2, “Caching SHA-2 Pluggable Authentication”](caching-sha2-pluggable-authentication.md "8.4.1.2 Caching SHA-2 Pluggable Authentication"), and
  [Section 8.4.1.3, “SHA-256 Pluggable Authentication”](sha256-pluggable-authentication.md "8.4.1.3 SHA-256 Pluggable Authentication").
- A client-side plugin that sends the password to the server
  without hashing or encryption. This plugin is used in
  conjunction with server-side plugins that require access to
  the password exactly as provided by the client user. See
  [Section 8.4.1.4, “Client-Side Cleartext Pluggable Authentication”](cleartext-pluggable-authentication.md "8.4.1.4 Client-Side Cleartext Pluggable Authentication").
- A plugin that performs external authentication using PAM
  (Pluggable Authentication Modules), enabling MySQL Server to
  use PAM to authenticate MySQL users. This plugin supports
  proxy users as well. See
  [Section 8.4.1.5, “PAM Pluggable Authentication”](pam-pluggable-authentication.md "8.4.1.5 PAM Pluggable Authentication").
- A plugin that performs external authentication on Windows,
  enabling MySQL Server to use native Windows services to
  authenticate client connections. Users who have logged in to
  Windows can connect from MySQL client programs to the server
  based on the information in their environment without
  specifying an additional password. This plugin supports
  proxy users as well. See
  [Section 8.4.1.6, “Windows Pluggable Authentication”](windows-pluggable-authentication.md "8.4.1.6 Windows Pluggable Authentication").
- Plugins that perform authentication using LDAP (Lightweight
  Directory Access Protocol) to authenticate MySQL users by
  accessing directory services such as X.500. These plugins
  support proxy users as well. See
  [Section 8.4.1.7, “LDAP Pluggable Authentication”](ldap-pluggable-authentication.md "8.4.1.7 LDAP Pluggable Authentication").
- A plugin that performs authentication using Kerberos to
  authenticate MySQL users that correspond to Kerberos
  principals. See
  [Section 8.4.1.8, “Kerberos Pluggable Authentication”](kerberos-pluggable-authentication.md "8.4.1.8 Kerberos Pluggable Authentication").
- A plugin that prevents all client connections to any account
  that uses it. Use cases for this plugin include proxied
  accounts that should never permit direct login but are
  accessed only through proxy accounts and accounts that must
  be able to execute stored programs and views with elevated
  privileges without exposing those privileges to ordinary
  users. See
  [Section 8.4.1.9, “No-Login Pluggable Authentication”](no-login-pluggable-authentication.md "8.4.1.9 No-Login Pluggable Authentication").
- A plugin that authenticates clients that connect from the
  local host through the Unix socket file. See
  [Section 8.4.1.10, “Socket Peer-Credential Pluggable Authentication”](socket-pluggable-authentication.md "8.4.1.10 Socket Peer-Credential Pluggable Authentication").
- A plugin that authenticates users to MySQL Server using FIDO
  authentication. See
  [Section 8.4.1.11, “FIDO Pluggable Authentication”](fido-pluggable-authentication.md "8.4.1.11 FIDO Pluggable Authentication").

  Note

  As of MySQL 8.0.35, the
  `authentication_fido` and
  `authentication_fido_client`
  authentication plugins are deprecated and subject to
  removal in a future version of MySQL.
- A test plugin that checks account credentials and logs
  success or failure to the server error log. This plugin is
  intended for testing and development purposes, and as an
  example of how to write an authentication plugin. See
  [Section 8.4.1.12, “Test Pluggable Authentication”](test-pluggable-authentication.md "8.4.1.12 Test Pluggable Authentication").

Note

For information about current restrictions on the use of
pluggable authentication, including which connectors support
which plugins, see
[Restrictions on Pluggable Authentication](pluggable-authentication.md#pluggable-authentication-restrictions "Restrictions on Pluggable Authentication").

Third-party connector developers should read that section to
determine the extent to which a connector can take advantage
of pluggable authentication capabilities and what steps to
take to become more compliant.

If you are interested in writing your own authentication
plugins, see [Writing Authentication Plugins](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/extending-mysql/8.0/en/writing-authentication-plugins.html).

#### The Default Authentication Plugin

The [`CREATE USER`](create-user.md "15.7.1.3 CREATE USER Statement") and
[`ALTER USER`](alter-user.md "15.7.1.1 ALTER USER Statement") statements have syntax
for specifying how an account authenticates. Some forms of this
syntax do not explicitly name an authentication plugin (there is
no `IDENTIFIED WITH` clause). For example:

```sql
CREATE USER 'jeffrey'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'password';
```

In such cases, the server assigns the default authentication
plugin to the account. Prior to MySQL 8.0.27, this default is
the value of the
[`default_authentication_plugin`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_default_authentication_plugin)
system variable.

As of MySQL 8.0.27, which introduces multifactor authentication,
there can be up to three clauses that specify how an account
authenticates. The rules that determine the default
authentication plugin for authentication methods that name no
plugin are factor-specific:

- Factor 1: If
  [`authentication_policy`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_authentication_policy)
  element 1 names an authentication plugin, that plugin is the
  default. If
  [`authentication_policy`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_authentication_policy)
  element 1 is `*`, the value of
  [`default_authentication_plugin`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_default_authentication_plugin)
  is the default.

  Given the rules above, the following statement creates a
  two-factor authentication account, with the first factor
  authentication method determined by the
  [`authentication_policy`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_authentication_policy) or
  [`default_authentication_plugin`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_default_authentication_plugin)
  setting:

  ```sql
  CREATE USER 'wei'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'password'
    AND IDENTIFIED WITH authentication_ldap_simple;
  ```

  In the same way, this example creates a three-factor
  authentication account:

  ```sql
  CREATE USER 'mateo'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'password'
    AND IDENTIFIED WITH authentication_ldap_simple
    AND IDENTIFIED WITH authentication_fido;
  ```

  You can use [`SHOW CREATE USER`](show-create-user.md "15.7.7.12 SHOW CREATE USER Statement")
  to view the applied authentication methods.
- Factor 2 or 3: If the corresponding
  [`authentication_policy`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_authentication_policy)
  element names an authentication plugin, that plugin is the
  default. If the
  [`authentication_policy`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_authentication_policy)
  element is `*` or empty, there is no
  default; attempting to define an account authentication
  method for the factor without naming a plugin is an error,
  as in the following examples:

  ```sql
  mysql> CREATE USER 'sofia'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED WITH authentication_ldap_simple
         AND IDENTIFIED BY 'abc';
  ERROR 1524 (HY000): Plugin '' is not loaded

  mysql> CREATE USER 'sofia'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED WITH authentication_ldap_simple
         AND IDENTIFIED BY 'abc';
  ERROR 1524 (HY000): Plugin '*' is not loaded
  ```

#### Authentication Plugin Usage

This section provides general instructions for installing and
using authentication plugins. For instructions specific to a
given plugin, see the section that describes that plugin under
[Section 8.4.1, “Authentication Plugins”](authentication-plugins.md "8.4.1 Authentication Plugins").

In general, pluggable authentication uses a pair of
corresponding plugins on the server and client sides, so you use
a given authentication method like this:

- If necessary, install the plugin library or libraries
  containing the appropriate plugins. On the server host,
  install the library containing the server-side plugin, so
  that the server can use it to authenticate client
  connections. Similarly, on each client host, install the
  library containing the client-side plugin for use by client
  programs. Authentication plugins that are built in need not
  be installed.
- For each MySQL account that you create, specify the
  appropriate server-side plugin to use for authentication. If
  the account is to use the default authentication plugin, the
  account-creation statement need not specify the plugin
  explicitly. The server assigns the default authentication
  plugin, determined as described in
  [The Default Authentication Plugin](pluggable-authentication.md#pluggable-authentication-default-plugin "The Default Authentication Plugin").
- When a client connects, the server-side plugin tells the
  client program which client-side plugin to use for
  authentication.

In the case that an account uses an authentication method that
is the default for both the server and the client program, the
server need not communicate to the client which client-side
plugin to use, and a round trip in client/server negotiation can
be avoided.

For standard MySQL clients such as [**mysql**](mysql.md "6.5.1 mysql — The MySQL Command-Line Client") and
[**mysqladmin**](mysqladmin.md "6.5.2 mysqladmin — A MySQL Server Administration Program"), the
[`--default-auth=plugin_name`](mysql-command-options.md#option_mysql_default-auth)
option can be specified on the command line as a hint about
which client-side plugin the program can expect to use, although
the server overrides this if the server-side plugin associated
with the user account requires a different client-side plugin.

If the client program does not find the client-side plugin
library file, specify a
[`--plugin-dir=dir_name`](mysql-command-options.md#option_mysql_plugin-dir)
option to indicate the plugin library directory location.

#### Authentication Plugin Client/Server Compatibility

Pluggable authentication enables flexibility in the choice of
authentication methods for MySQL accounts, but in some cases
client connections cannot be established due to authentication
plugin incompatibility between the client and server.

The general compatibility principle for a successful client
connection to a given account on a given server is that the
client and server both must support the authentication
*method* required by the account. Because
authentication methods are implemented by authentication
plugins, the client and server both must support the
authentication *plugin* required by the
account.

Authentication plugin incompatibilities can arise in various
ways. Examples:

- Connect using a MySQL 5.7 client from 5.7.22 or lower to a
  MySQL 8.0 server account that authenticates with
  `caching_sha2_password`. This fails because
  the 5.7 client does not recognize the plugin, which was
  introduced in MySQL 8.0. (This issue is addressed in MySQL
  5.7 as of 5.7.23, when
  `caching_sha2_password` client-side support
  was added to the MySQL client library and client programs.)
- Connect using a MySQL 5.7 client to a pre-5.7 server account
  that authenticates with
  `mysql_old_password`. This fails for
  multiple reasons. First, such a connection requires
  `--secure-auth=0`, which is no longer a
  supported option. Even were it supported, the 5.7 client
  does not recognize the plugin because it was removed in
  MySQL 5.7.
- Connect using a MySQL 5.7 client from a Community
  distribution to a MySQL 5.7 Enterprise server account that
  authenticates using one of the Enterprise-only LDAP
  authentication plugins. This fails because the Community
  client does not have access to the Enterprise plugin.

In general, these compatibility issues do not arise when
connections are made between a client and server from the same
MySQL distribution. When connections are made between a client
and server from different MySQL series, issues can arise. These
issues are inherent in the development process when MySQL
introduces new authentication plugins or removes old ones. To
minimize the potential for incompatibilities, regularly upgrade
the server, clients, and connectors on a timely basis.

#### Authentication Plugin Connector-Writing Considerations

Various implementations of the MySQL client/server protocol
exist. The `libmysqlclient` C API client
library is one implementation. Some MySQL connectors (typically
those not written in C) provide their own implementation.
However, not all protocol implementations handle plugin
authentication the same way. This section describes an
authentication issue that protocol implementors should take into
account.

In the client/server protocol, the server tells connecting
clients which authentication plugin it considers the default. If
the protocol implementation used by the client tries to load the
default plugin and that plugin does not exist on the client
side, the load operation fails. This is an unnecessary failure
if the default plugin is not the plugin actually required by the
account to which the client is trying to connect.

If a client/server protocol implementation does not have its own
notion of default authentication plugin and always tries to load
the default plugin specified by the server, it fails with an
error if that plugin is not available.

To avoid this problem, the protocol implementation used by the
client should have its own default plugin and should use it as
its first choice (or, alternatively, fall back to this default
in case of failure to load the default plugin specified by the
server). Example:

- In MySQL 5.7, `libmysqlclient` uses as its
  default choice either
  `mysql_native_password` or the plugin
  specified through the `MYSQL_DEFAULT_AUTH`
  option for [`mysql_options()`](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/c-api/8.0/en/mysql-options.html).
- When a 5.7 client tries to connect to an 8.0 server, the
  server specifies `caching_sha2_password` as
  its default authentication plugin, but the client still
  sends credential details per either
  `mysql_native_password` or whatever is
  specified through `MYSQL_DEFAULT_AUTH`.
- The only time the client loads the plugin specified by the
  server is for a change-plugin request, but in that case it
  can be any plugin depending on the user account. In this
  case, the client must try to load the plugin, and if that
  plugin is not available, an error is not optional.

#### Restrictions on Pluggable Authentication

The first part of this section describes general restrictions on
the applicability of the pluggable authentication framework
described at [Section 8.2.17, “Pluggable Authentication”](pluggable-authentication.md "8.2.17 Pluggable Authentication"). The
second part describes how third-party connector developers can
determine the extent to which a connector can take advantage of
pluggable authentication capabilities and what steps to take to
become more compliant.

The term “native authentication” used here refers
to authentication against passwords stored in the
`mysql.user` system table. This is the same
authentication method provided by older MySQL servers, before
pluggable authentication was implemented. “Windows native
authentication” refers to authentication using the
credentials of a user who has already logged in to Windows, as
implemented by the Windows Native Authentication plugin
(“Windows plugin” for short).

- [General Pluggable Authentication Restrictions](pluggable-authentication.md#pluggable-authentication-restrictions-general "General Pluggable Authentication Restrictions")
- [Pluggable Authentication and Third-Party Connectors](pluggable-authentication.md#pluggable-authentication-restrictions-third-party-connectors "Pluggable Authentication and Third-Party Connectors")

##### General Pluggable Authentication Restrictions

- **Connector/C++:** Clients that
  use this connector can connect to the server only through
  accounts that use native authentication.

  Exception: A connector supports pluggable authentication if
  it was built to link to `libmysqlclient`
  dynamically (rather than statically) and it loads the
  current version of `libmysqlclient` if that
  version is installed, or if the connector is recompiled from
  source to link against the current
  `libmysqlclient`.

  For information about writing connectors to handle
  information from the server about the default server-side
  authentication plugin, see
  [Authentication Plugin Connector-Writing Considerations](pluggable-authentication.md#pluggable-authentication-connector-writing "Authentication Plugin Connector-Writing Considerations").
- **Connector/NET:** Clients that use
  Connector/NET can connect to the server through accounts that use
  native authentication or Windows native authentication.
- **Connector/PHP:** Clients that
  use this connector can connect to the server only through
  accounts that use native authentication, when compiled using
  the MySQL native driver for PHP
  (`mysqlnd`).
- **Windows native
  authentication:** Connecting through an account
  that uses the Windows plugin requires Windows Domain setup.
  Without it, NTLM authentication is used and then only local
  connections are possible; that is, the client and server
  must run on the same computer.
- **Proxy users:** Proxy user
  support is available to the extent that clients can connect
  through accounts authenticated with plugins that implement
  proxy user capability (that is, plugins that can return a
  user name different from that of the connecting user). For
  example, the PAM and Windows plugins support proxy users.
  The `mysql_native_password` and
  `sha256_password` authentication plugins do
  not support proxy users by default, but can be configured to
  do so; see
  [Server Support for Proxy User Mapping](proxy-users.md#proxy-users-server-user-mapping "Server Support for Proxy User Mapping").
- **Replication**: Replicas can
  not only employ replication user accounts using native
  authentication, but can also connect through replication
  user accounts that use nonnative authentication if the
  required client-side plugin is available. If the plugin is
  built into `libmysqlclient`, it is
  available by default. Otherwise, the plugin must be
  installed on the replica side in the directory named by the
  replica's [`plugin_dir`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_plugin_dir) system
  variable.
- **[`FEDERATED`](federated-storage-engine.md "18.8 The FEDERATED Storage Engine")
  tables:** A [`FEDERATED`](federated-storage-engine.md "18.8 The FEDERATED Storage Engine")
  table can access the remote table only through accounts on
  the remote server that use native authentication.

##### Pluggable Authentication and Third-Party Connectors

Third-party connector developers can use the following
guidelines to determine readiness of a connector to take
advantage of pluggable authentication capabilities and what
steps to take to become more compliant:

- An existing connector to which no changes have been made
  uses native authentication and clients that use the
  connector can connect to the server only through accounts
  that use native authentication. *However, you
  should test the connector against a recent version of the
  server to verify that such connections still work without
  problem.*

  Exception: A connector might work with pluggable
  authentication without any changes if it links to
  `libmysqlclient` dynamically (rather than
  statically) and it loads the current version of
  `libmysqlclient` if that version is
  installed.
- To take advantage of pluggable authentication capabilities,
  a connector that is `libmysqlclient`-based
  should be relinked against the current version of
  `libmysqlclient`. This enables the
  connector to support connections though accounts that
  require client-side plugins now built into
  `libmysqlclient` (such as the cleartext
  plugin needed for PAM authentication and the Windows plugin
  needed for Windows native authentication). Linking with a
  current `libmysqlclient` also enables the
  connector to access client-side plugins installed in the
  default MySQL plugin directory (typically the directory
  named by the default value of the local server's
  [`plugin_dir`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_plugin_dir) system
  variable).

  If a connector links to `libmysqlclient`
  dynamically, it must be ensured that the newer version of
  `libmysqlclient` is installed on the client
  host and that the connector loads it at runtime.
- Another way for a connector to support a given
  authentication method is to implement it directly in the
  client/server protocol. Connector/NET uses this approach to provide
  support for Windows native authentication.
- If a connector should be able to load client-side plugins
  from a directory different from the default plugin
  directory, it must implement some means for client users to
  specify the directory. Possibilities for this include a
  command-line option or environment variable from which the
  connector can obtain the directory name. Standard MySQL
  client programs such as [**mysql**](mysql.md "6.5.1 mysql — The MySQL Command-Line Client") and
  [**mysqladmin**](mysqladmin.md "6.5.2 mysqladmin — A MySQL Server Administration Program") implement a
  `--plugin-dir` option. See also
  [C API Client Plugin Interface](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/c-api/8.0/en/c-api-plugin-interface.html).
- Proxy user support by a connector depends, as described
  earlier in this section, on whether the authentication
  methods that it supports permit proxy users.
