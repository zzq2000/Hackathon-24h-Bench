#### 30.4.3.8 The innodb\_buffer\_stats\_by\_table and x$innodb\_buffer\_stats\_by\_table Views

These views summarize the information in the
`INFORMATION_SCHEMA`
[`INNODB_BUFFER_PAGE`](information-schema-innodb-buffer-page-table.md "28.4.2 The INFORMATION_SCHEMA INNODB_BUFFER_PAGE Table") table, grouped
by schema and table. By default, rows are sorted by descending
buffer size.

Warning

Querying views that access the
[`INNODB_BUFFER_PAGE`](information-schema-innodb-buffer-page-table.md "28.4.2 The INFORMATION_SCHEMA INNODB_BUFFER_PAGE Table") table can
affect performance. Do not query these views on a production
system unless you are aware of the performance impact and
have determined it to be acceptable. To avoid impacting
performance on a production system, reproduce the issue you
want to investigate and query buffer pool statistics on a
test instance.
