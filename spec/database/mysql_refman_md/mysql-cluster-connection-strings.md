#### 25.4.3.3 NDB Cluster Connection Strings

With the exception of the NDB Cluster management server
([**ndb\_mgmd**](mysql-cluster-programs-ndb-mgmd.md "25.5.4 ndb_mgmd — The NDB Cluster Management Server Daemon")), each node that is part of an NDB
Cluster requires a connection
string that points to the management server's
location. This connection string is used in establishing a
connection to the management server as well as in performing
other tasks depending on the node's role in the cluster. The
syntax for a connection string is as follows:

```simple
[nodeid=node_id, ]host-definition[, host-definition[, ...]]

host-definition:
    host_name[:port_number]
```

`node_id` is an integer greater than or equal
to 1 which identifies a node in `config.ini`.
*`host_name`* is a string representing a
valid Internet host name or IP address.
*`port_number`* is an integer referring
to a TCP/IP port number.

```simple
example 1 (long):    "nodeid=2,myhost1:1100,myhost2:1100,198.51.100.3:1200"
example 2 (short):   "myhost1"
```

`localhost:1186` is used as the default
connection string value if none is provided. If
*`port_num`* is omitted from the
connection string, the default port is 1186. This port should
always be available on the network because it has been assigned
by IANA for this purpose (see
<http://www.iana.org/assignments/port-numbers> for
details).

By listing multiple host definitions, it is possible to
designate several redundant management servers. An NDB Cluster
data or API node attempts to contact successive management
servers on each host in the order specified, until a successful
connection has been established.

It is also possible to specify in a connection string one or
more bind addresses to be used by nodes having multiple network
interfaces for connecting to management servers. A bind address
consists of a hostname or network address and an optional port
number. This enhanced syntax for connection strings is shown
here:

```simple
[nodeid=node_id, ]
    [bind-address=host-definition, ]
    host-definition[; bind-address=host-definition]
    host-definition[; bind-address=host-definition]
    [, ...]]

host-definition:
    host_name[:port_number]
```

If a single bind address is used in the connection string
*prior* to specifying any management hosts,
then this address is used as the default for connecting to any
of them (unless overridden for a given management server; see
later in this section for an example). For example, the
following connection string causes the node to use
`198.51.100.242` regardless of the management
server to which it connects:

```simple
bind-address=198.51.100.242, poseidon:1186, perch:1186
```

If a bind address is specified *following* a
management host definition, then it is used only for connecting
to that management node. Consider the following connection
string:

```simple
poseidon:1186;bind-address=localhost, perch:1186;bind-address=198.51.100.242
```

In this case, the node uses `localhost` to
connect to the management server running on the host named
`poseidon` and
`198.51.100.242` to connect to the management
server running on the host named `perch`.

You can specify a default bind address and then override this
default for one or more specific management hosts. In the
following example, `localhost` is used for
connecting to the management server running on host
`poseidon`; since
`198.51.100.242` is specified first (before any
management server definitions), it is the default bind address
and so is used for connecting to the management servers on hosts
`perch` and `orca`:

```simple
bind-address=198.51.100.242,poseidon:1186;bind-address=localhost,perch:1186,orca:2200
```

There are a number of different ways to specify the connection
string:

- Each executable has its own command-line option which
  enables specifying the management server at startup. (See
  the documentation for the respective executable.)
- It is also possible to set the connection string for all
  nodes in the cluster at once by placing it in a
  `[mysql_cluster]` section in the management
  server's `my.cnf` file.
- For backward compatibility, two other options are available,
  using the same syntax:

  1. Set the `NDB_CONNECTSTRING` environment
     variable to contain the connection string.

     This should be considered deprecated, and not used in
     new installations.
  2. Write the connection string for each executable into a
     text file named `Ndb.cfg` and place
     this file in the executable's startup directory.

     Use of this file is deprecated in NDB 8.0.40; you should
     expect it to be removed in a future release of MySQL
     Cluster.

The recommended method for specifying the connection string is
to set it on the command line or in the
`my.cnf` file for each executable.
