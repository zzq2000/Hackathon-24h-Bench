#### 17.8.3.4 Configuring InnoDB Buffer Pool Prefetching (Read-Ahead)

A [read-ahead](glossary.md#glos_read_ahead "read-ahead") request is
an I/O request to prefetch multiple pages in the
[buffer pool](glossary.md#glos_buffer_pool "buffer pool")
asynchronously, in anticipation of impending need for these
pages. The requests bring in all the pages in one
[extent](glossary.md#glos_extent "extent").
`InnoDB` uses two read-ahead algorithms to
improve I/O performance:

**Linear** read-ahead is a
technique that predicts what pages might be needed soon based on
pages in the buffer pool being accessed sequentially. You
control when `InnoDB` performs a read-ahead
operation by adjusting the number of sequential page accesses
required to trigger an asynchronous read request, using the
configuration parameter
[`innodb_read_ahead_threshold`](innodb-parameters.md#sysvar_innodb_read_ahead_threshold).
Before this parameter was added, `InnoDB` would
only calculate whether to issue an asynchronous prefetch request
for the entire next extent when it read the last page of the
current extent.

The configuration parameter
[`innodb_read_ahead_threshold`](innodb-parameters.md#sysvar_innodb_read_ahead_threshold)
controls how sensitive `InnoDB` is in detecting
patterns of sequential page access. If the number of pages read
sequentially from an extent is greater than or equal to
[`innodb_read_ahead_threshold`](innodb-parameters.md#sysvar_innodb_read_ahead_threshold),
`InnoDB` initiates an asynchronous read-ahead
operation of the entire following extent.
[`innodb_read_ahead_threshold`](innodb-parameters.md#sysvar_innodb_read_ahead_threshold) can
be set to any value from 0-64. The default value is 56. The
higher the value, the more strict the access pattern check. For
example, if you set the value to 48, `InnoDB`
triggers a linear read-ahead request only when 48 pages in the
current extent have been accessed sequentially. If the value is
8, `InnoDB` triggers an asynchronous read-ahead
even if as few as 8 pages in the extent are accessed
sequentially. You can set the value of this parameter in the
MySQL [configuration
file](glossary.md#glos_configuration_file "configuration file"), or change it dynamically with the
[`SET
GLOBAL`](set-variable.md "15.7.6.1 SET Syntax for Variable Assignment") statement, which requires privileges sufficient
to set global system variables. See
[Section 7.1.9.1, “System Variable Privileges”](system-variable-privileges.md "7.1.9.1 System Variable Privileges").

**Random** read-ahead is a
technique that predicts when pages might be needed soon based on
pages already in the buffer pool, regardless of the order in
which those pages were read. If 13 consecutive pages from the
same extent are found in the buffer pool,
`InnoDB` asynchronously issues a request to
prefetch the remaining pages of the extent. To enable this
feature, set the configuration variable
[`innodb_random_read_ahead`](innodb-parameters.md#sysvar_innodb_random_read_ahead) to
`ON`.

The `SHOW ENGINE INNODB STATUS` command
displays statistics to help you evaluate the effectiveness of
the read-ahead algorithm. Statistics include counter information
for the following global status variables:

- [`Innodb_buffer_pool_read_ahead`](server-status-variables.md#statvar_Innodb_buffer_pool_read_ahead)
- [`Innodb_buffer_pool_read_ahead_evicted`](server-status-variables.md#statvar_Innodb_buffer_pool_read_ahead_evicted)
- [`Innodb_buffer_pool_read_ahead_rnd`](server-status-variables.md#statvar_Innodb_buffer_pool_read_ahead_rnd)

This information can be useful when fine-tuning the
[`innodb_random_read_ahead`](innodb-parameters.md#sysvar_innodb_random_read_ahead)
setting.
