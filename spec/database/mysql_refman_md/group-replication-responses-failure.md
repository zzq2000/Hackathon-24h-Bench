### 20.7.7 Responses to Failure Detection and Network Partitioning

[20.7.7.1 Expel Timeout](group-replication-responses-failure-expel.md)

[20.7.7.2 Unreachable Majority Timeout](group-replication-responses-failure-partition.md)

[20.7.7.3 Auto-Rejoin](group-replication-responses-failure-rejoin.md)

[20.7.7.4 Exit Action](group-replication-responses-failure-exit.md)

Group Replication's failure detection mechanism is designed to
identify group members that are no longer communicating with the
group, and expel them as and when it seems likely that they have
failed. Having a failure detection mechanism increases the chance
that the group contains a majority of correctly working members,
and that requests from clients are therefore processed correctly.

Normally, all group members regularly exchange messages with all
other group members. If a group member does not receive any
messages from a particular fellow member for 5 seconds, when this
detection period ends, it creates a suspicion of the fellow
member. When a suspicion times out, the suspected member is
assumed to have failed, and is expelled from the group. An
expelled member is removed from the membership list seen by the
other members, but it does not know that it has been expelled from
the group, so it sees itself as online and the other members as
unreachable. If the member has not in fact failed (for example,
because it was just disconnected due to a temporary network issue)
and it is able to resume communication with the other members, it
receives a view containing the information that it has been
expelled from the group.

The responses of group members, including the failed member
itself, to these situations can be configured at a number of
points in the process. By default, the following behaviors happen
if a member is suspected of having failed:

1. Up to MySQL 8.0.20, when a suspicion is created, it times out
   immediately. The suspected member is liable for expulsion as
   soon as the expired suspicion is identified by the group. The
   member could potentially survive for a further few seconds
   after the timeout because the check for expired suspicions is
   carried out periodically. From MySQL 8.0.21, a waiting period
   of 5 seconds is added before the suspicion times out and the
   suspected member is liable for expulsion.
2. If an expelled member resumes communication and realises that
   it was expelled, up to MySQL 8.0.20, it does not try to rejoin
   the group. From MySQL 8.0.21, it makes three automatic
   attempts to rejoin the group (with 5 minutes between each
   attempt), and if this auto-rejoin procedure does not work, it
   then stops trying to rejoin the group.
3. When an expelled member is not trying to rejoin the group, it
   switches to super read only mode and awaits operator
   attention. (The exception is in releases from MySQL 8.0.12 to
   8.0.15, where the default was for the member to shut itself
   down. From MySQL 8.0.16, the behavior was changed to match the
   behavior in MySQL 5.7.)

You can use the Group Replication configuration options described
in this section to change these behaviors either permanently or
temporarily, to suit your system's requirements and your
priorities. If you are experiencing unnecessary expulsions caused
by slower networks or machines, networks with a high rate of
unexpected transient outages, or planned network outages, consider
increasing the expel timeout and auto-rejoin attempts. From MySQL
8.0.21, the default settings have been changed in this direction
to reduce the frequency of the need for operator intervention to
reinstate expelled members in these situations. Note that while a
member is undergoing any of the default behaviors described above,
although it does not accept writes, reads can still be made if the
member is still communicating with clients, with an increasing
likelihood of stale reads over time. If avoiding stale reads is a
higher priority for you than avoiding operator intervention,
consider reducing the expel timeout and auto-rejoin attempts or
setting them to zero.

Members that have not failed might lose contact with part, but not
all, of the replication group due to a network partition. For
example, in a group of 5 servers (S1,S2,S3,S4,S5), if there is a
disconnection between (S1,S2) and (S3,S4,S5) there is a network
partition. The first group (S1,S2) is now in a minority because it
cannot contact more than half of the group. Any transactions that
are processed by the members in the minority group are blocked,
because the majority of the group is unreachable, therefore the
group cannot achieve quorum. For a detailed description of this
scenario, see
[Section 20.7.8, “Handling a Network Partition and Loss of Quorum”](group-replication-network-partitioning.md "20.7.8 Handling a Network Partition and Loss of Quorum"). In this
situation, the default behavior is for the members in both the
minority and the majority to remain in the group, continue to
accept transactions (although they are blocked on the members in
the minority), and wait for operator intervention. This behavior
is also configurable.

Note that where group members are at an older MySQL Server release
that does not support a relevant setting, or at a release with a
different default, they act towards themselves and other group
members according to the default behaviors stated above. For
example, a member that does not support the
[`group_replication_member_expel_timeout`](group-replication-system-variables.md#sysvar_group_replication_member_expel_timeout)
system variable expels other members as soon as an expired
suspicion is detected, and this expulsion is accepted by other
members even if they support the system variable and have a longer
timeout set.
