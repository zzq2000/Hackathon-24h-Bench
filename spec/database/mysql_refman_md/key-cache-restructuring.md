#### 10.10.2.6 Restructuring a Key Cache

A key cache can be restructured at any time by updating its
parameter values. For example:

```sql
mysql> SET GLOBAL cold_cache.key_buffer_size=4*1024*1024;
```

If you assign to either the
[`key_buffer_size`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_key_buffer_size) or
[`key_cache_block_size`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_key_cache_block_size) key
cache component a value that differs from the component's
current value, the server destroys the cache's old
structure and creates a new one based on the new values. If
the cache contains any dirty blocks, the server saves them to
disk before destroying and re-creating the cache.
Restructuring does not occur if you change other key cache
parameters.

When restructuring a key cache, the server first flushes the
contents of any dirty buffers to disk. After that, the cache
contents become unavailable. However, restructuring does not
block queries that need to use indexes assigned to the cache.
Instead, the server directly accesses the table indexes using
native file system caching. File system caching is not as
efficient as using a key cache, so although queries execute, a
slowdown can be anticipated. After the cache has been
restructured, it becomes available again for caching indexes
assigned to it, and the use of file system caching for the
indexes ceases.
