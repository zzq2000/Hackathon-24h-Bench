### 15.1.22 CREATE TRIGGER Statement

```sql
CREATE
    [DEFINER = user]
    TRIGGER [IF NOT EXISTS] trigger_name
    trigger_time trigger_event
    ON tbl_name FOR EACH ROW
    [trigger_order]
    trigger_body

trigger_time: { BEFORE | AFTER }

trigger_event: { INSERT | UPDATE | DELETE }

trigger_order: { FOLLOWS | PRECEDES } other_trigger_name
```

This statement creates a new trigger. A trigger is a named
database object that is associated with a table, and that
activates when a particular event occurs for the table. The
trigger becomes associated with the table named
*`tbl_name`*, which must refer to a
permanent table. You cannot associate a trigger with a
`TEMPORARY` table or a view.

Trigger names exist in the schema namespace, meaning that all
triggers must have unique names within a schema. Triggers in
different schemas can have the same name.

`IF NOT EXISTS` prevents an error from occurring
if a trigger having the same name, on the same table, exists in
the same schema. This option is supported with `CREATE
TRIGGER` beginning with MySQL 8.0.29.

This section describes [`CREATE
TRIGGER`](create-trigger.md "15.1.22 CREATE TRIGGER Statement") syntax. For additional discussion, see
[Section 27.3.1, “Trigger Syntax and Examples”](trigger-syntax.md "27.3.1 Trigger Syntax and Examples").

[`CREATE TRIGGER`](create-trigger.md "15.1.22 CREATE TRIGGER Statement") requires the
[`TRIGGER`](privileges-provided.md#priv_trigger) privilege for the table
associated with the trigger. If the `DEFINER`
clause is present, the privileges required depend on the
*`user`* value, as discussed in
[Section 27.6, “Stored Object Access Control”](stored-objects-security.md "27.6 Stored Object Access Control"). If binary logging is
enabled, [`CREATE TRIGGER`](create-trigger.md "15.1.22 CREATE TRIGGER Statement") might
require the [`SUPER`](privileges-provided.md#priv_super) privilege, as
discussed in [Section 27.7, “Stored Program Binary Logging”](stored-programs-logging.md "27.7 Stored Program Binary Logging").

The `DEFINER` clause determines the security
context to be used when checking access privileges at trigger
activation time, as described later in this section.

*`trigger_time`* is the trigger action
time. It can be `BEFORE` or
`AFTER` to indicate that the trigger activates
before or after each row to be modified.

Basic column value checks occur prior to trigger activation, so
you cannot use `BEFORE` triggers to convert
values inappropriate for the column type to valid values.

*`trigger_event`* indicates the kind of
operation that activates the trigger. These
*`trigger_event`* values are permitted:

- [`INSERT`](insert.md "15.2.7 INSERT Statement"): The trigger activates
  whenever a new row is inserted into the table (for example,
  through [`INSERT`](insert.md "15.2.7 INSERT Statement"),
  [`LOAD DATA`](load-data.md "15.2.9 LOAD DATA Statement"), and
  [`REPLACE`](replace.md "15.2.12 REPLACE Statement") statements).
- [`UPDATE`](update.md "15.2.17 UPDATE Statement"): The trigger activates
  whenever a row is modified (for example, through
  [`UPDATE`](update.md "15.2.17 UPDATE Statement") statements).
- [`DELETE`](delete.md "15.2.2 DELETE Statement"): The trigger activates
  whenever a row is deleted from the table (for example, through
  [`DELETE`](delete.md "15.2.2 DELETE Statement") and
  [`REPLACE`](replace.md "15.2.12 REPLACE Statement") statements).
  [`DROP TABLE`](drop-table.md "15.1.32 DROP TABLE Statement") and
  [`TRUNCATE TABLE`](truncate-table.md "15.1.37 TRUNCATE TABLE Statement") statements on
  the table do *not* activate this trigger,
  because they do not use [`DELETE`](delete.md "15.2.2 DELETE Statement").
  Dropping a partition does not activate
  [`DELETE`](delete.md "15.2.2 DELETE Statement") triggers, either.

The *`trigger_event`* does not represent a
literal type of SQL statement that activates the trigger so much
as it represents a type of table operation. For example, an
[`INSERT`](insert.md "15.2.7 INSERT Statement") trigger activates not only
for [`INSERT`](insert.md "15.2.7 INSERT Statement") statements but also
[`LOAD DATA`](load-data.md "15.2.9 LOAD DATA Statement") statements because both
statements insert rows into a table.

A potentially confusing example of this is the `INSERT
INTO ... ON DUPLICATE KEY UPDATE ...` syntax: a
`BEFORE INSERT` trigger activates for every row,
followed by either an `AFTER INSERT` trigger or
both the `BEFORE UPDATE` and `AFTER
UPDATE` triggers, depending on whether there was a
duplicate key for the row.

Note

Cascaded foreign key actions do not activate triggers.

It is possible to define multiple triggers for a given table that
have the same trigger event and action time. For example, you can
have two `BEFORE UPDATE` triggers for a table. By
default, triggers that have the same trigger event and action time
activate in the order they were created. To affect trigger order,
specify a *`trigger_order`* clause that
indicates `FOLLOWS` or
`PRECEDES` and the name of an existing trigger
that also has the same trigger event and action time. With
`FOLLOWS`, the new trigger activates after the
existing trigger. With `PRECEDES`, the new
trigger activates before the existing trigger.

*`trigger_body`* is the statement to
execute when the trigger activates. To execute multiple
statements, use the
[`BEGIN ... END`](begin-end.md "15.6.1 BEGIN ... END Compound Statement")
compound statement construct. This also enables you to use the
same statements that are permitted within stored routines. See
[Section 15.6.1, “BEGIN ... END Compound Statement”](begin-end.md "15.6.1 BEGIN ... END Compound Statement"). Some statements are not permitted in
triggers; see [Section 27.8, “Restrictions on Stored Programs”](stored-program-restrictions.md "27.8 Restrictions on Stored Programs").

Within the trigger body, you can refer to columns in the subject
table (the table associated with the trigger) by using the aliases
`OLD` and `NEW`.
`OLD.col_name` refers
to a column of an existing row before it is updated or deleted.
`NEW.col_name` refers
to the column of a new row to be inserted or an existing row after
it is updated.

Triggers cannot use
`NEW.col_name` or use
`OLD.col_name` to
refer to generated columns. For information about generated
columns, see [Section 15.1.20.8, “CREATE TABLE and Generated Columns”](create-table-generated-columns.md "15.1.20.8 CREATE TABLE and Generated Columns").

MySQL stores the [`sql_mode`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_sql_mode) system
variable setting in effect when a trigger is created, and always
executes the trigger body with this setting in force,
*regardless of the current server SQL mode when the
trigger begins executing*.

The `DEFINER` clause specifies the MySQL account
to be used when checking access privileges at trigger activation
time. If the `DEFINER` clause is present, the
*`user`* value should be a MySQL account
specified as
`'user_name'@'host_name'`,
[`CURRENT_USER`](information-functions.md#function_current-user), or
[`CURRENT_USER()`](information-functions.md#function_current-user). The permitted
*`user`* values depend on the privileges
you hold, as discussed in
[Section 27.6, “Stored Object Access Control”](stored-objects-security.md "27.6 Stored Object Access Control"). Also see that section
for additional information about trigger security.

If the `DEFINER` clause is omitted, the default
definer is the user who executes the [`CREATE
TRIGGER`](create-trigger.md "15.1.22 CREATE TRIGGER Statement") statement. This is the same as specifying
`DEFINER = CURRENT_USER` explicitly.

MySQL takes the `DEFINER` user into account when
checking trigger privileges as follows:

- At [`CREATE TRIGGER`](create-trigger.md "15.1.22 CREATE TRIGGER Statement") time, the
  user who issues the statement must have the
  [`TRIGGER`](privileges-provided.md#priv_trigger) privilege.
- At trigger activation time, privileges are checked against the
  `DEFINER` user. This user must have these
  privileges:

  - The [`TRIGGER`](privileges-provided.md#priv_trigger) privilege for
    the subject table.
  - The [`SELECT`](privileges-provided.md#priv_select) privilege for
    the subject table if references to table columns occur
    using
    `OLD.col_name`
    or
    `NEW.col_name`
    in the trigger body.
  - The [`UPDATE`](privileges-provided.md#priv_update) privilege for
    the subject table if table columns are targets of
    `SET NEW.col_name =
    value` assignments in
    the trigger body.
  - Whatever other privileges normally are required for the
    statements executed by the trigger.

Within a trigger body, the
[`CURRENT_USER`](information-functions.md#function_current-user) function returns the
account used to check privileges at trigger activation time. This
is the `DEFINER` user, not the user whose actions
caused the trigger to be activated. For information about user
auditing within triggers, see
[Section 8.2.23, “SQL-Based Account Activity Auditing”](account-activity-auditing.md "8.2.23 SQL-Based Account Activity Auditing").

If you use [`LOCK TABLES`](lock-tables.md "15.3.6 LOCK TABLES and UNLOCK TABLES Statements") to lock a
table that has triggers, the tables used within the trigger are
also locked, as described in
[LOCK TABLES and Triggers](lock-tables.md#lock-tables-and-triggers "LOCK TABLES and Triggers").

[Section 27.3.1, “Trigger Syntax and Examples”](trigger-syntax.md "27.3.1 Trigger Syntax and Examples").
