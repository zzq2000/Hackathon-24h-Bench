#### 19.2.3.1 Monitoring Replication Main Threads

The [`SHOW PROCESSLIST`](show-processlist.md "15.7.7.29 SHOW PROCESSLIST Statement") statement
provides information that tells you what is happening on the
source and on the replica regarding replication. For information
on source states, see [Section 10.14.4, “Replication Source Thread States”](source-thread-states.md "10.14.4 Replication Source Thread States").
For replica states, see
[Section 10.14.5, “Replication I/O (Receiver) Thread States”](replica-io-thread-states.md "10.14.5 Replication I/O (Receiver) Thread States"), and
[Section 10.14.6, “Replication SQL Thread States”](replica-sql-thread-states.md "10.14.6 Replication SQL Thread States").

The following example illustrates how the three main replication
threads, the binary log dump thread, replication I/O (receiver)
thread, and replication SQL (applier) thread, show up in the
output from [`SHOW PROCESSLIST`](show-processlist.md "15.7.7.29 SHOW PROCESSLIST Statement").

On the source server, the output from [`SHOW
PROCESSLIST`](show-processlist.md "15.7.7.29 SHOW PROCESSLIST Statement") looks like this:

```sql
mysql> SHOW PROCESSLIST\G
*************************** 1. row ***************************
     Id: 2
   User: root
   Host: localhost:32931
     db: NULL
Command: Binlog Dump
   Time: 94
  State: Has sent all binlog to slave; waiting for binlog to
         be updated
   Info: NULL
```

Here, thread 2 is a `Binlog Dump` thread that
services a connected replica. The `State`
information indicates that all outstanding updates have been
sent to the replica and that the source is waiting for more
updates to occur. If you see no `Binlog Dump`
threads on a source server, this means that replication is not
running; that is, no replicas are currently connected.

On a replica server, the output from [`SHOW
PROCESSLIST`](show-processlist.md "15.7.7.29 SHOW PROCESSLIST Statement") looks like this:

```sql
mysql> SHOW PROCESSLIST\G
*************************** 1. row ***************************
     Id: 10
   User: system user
   Host:
     db: NULL
Command: Connect
   Time: 11
  State: Waiting for master to send event
   Info: NULL
*************************** 2. row ***************************
     Id: 11
   User: system user
   Host:
     db: NULL
Command: Connect
   Time: 11
  State: Has read all relay log; waiting for the slave I/O
         thread to update it
   Info: NULL
```

The `State` information indicates that thread
10 is the replication I/O (receiver) thread that is
communicating with the source server, and thread 11 is the
replication SQL (applier) thread that is processing the updates
stored in the relay logs. At the time that
[`SHOW PROCESSLIST`](show-processlist.md "15.7.7.29 SHOW PROCESSLIST Statement") was run, both
threads were idle, waiting for further updates.

The value in the `Time` column can show how
late the replica is compared to the source. See
[Section A.14, “MySQL 8.0 FAQ: Replication”](faqs-replication.md "A.14 MySQL 8.0 FAQ: Replication"). If sufficient time elapses
on the source side without activity on the `Binlog
Dump` thread, the source determines that the replica is
no longer connected. As for any other client connection, the
timeouts for this depend on the values of
`net_write_timeout` and
`net_retry_count`; for more information about
these, see [Section 7.1.8, “Server System Variables”](server-system-variables.md "7.1.8 Server System Variables").

The [`SHOW
REPLICA STATUS`](show-replica-status.md "15.7.7.35 SHOW REPLICA STATUS Statement") statement provides additional
information about replication processing on a replica server.
See [Section 19.1.7.1, “Checking Replication Status”](replication-administration-status.md "19.1.7.1 Checking Replication Status").
