## 31.9 MySQL Perl API

The Perl `DBI` module provides a generic interface
for database access. You can write a DBI script that works with many
different database engines without change. To use DBI with MySQL,
install the following:

1. The `DBI` module.
2. The `DBD::mysql` module. This is the DataBase
   Driver (DBD) module for Perl.
3. Optionally, the DBD module for any other type of database server
   you want to access.

Perl DBI is the recommended Perl interface. It replaces an older
interface called `mysqlperl`, which should be
considered obsolete.

These sections contain information about using Perl with MySQL and
writing MySQL applications in Perl:

- For installation instructions for Perl DBI support, see
  [Section 2.10, “Perl Installation Notes”](perl-support.md "2.10 Perl Installation Notes").
- For an example of reading options from option files, see
  [Section 7.8.4, “Using Client Programs in a Multiple-Server Environment”](multiple-server-clients.md "7.8.4 Using Client Programs in a Multiple-Server Environment").
- For secure coding tips, see
  [Section 8.1.1, “Security Guidelines”](security-guidelines.md "8.1.1 Security Guidelines").
- For debugging tips, see [Section 7.9.1.4, “Debugging mysqld under gdb”](using-gdb-on-mysqld.md "7.9.1.4 Debugging mysqld under gdb").
- For some Perl-specific environment variables, see
  [Section 6.9, “Environment Variables”](environment-variables.md "6.9 Environment Variables").
- For considerations for running on macOS, see
  [Section 2.4, “Installing MySQL on macOS”](macos-installation.md "2.4 Installing MySQL on macOS").
- For ways to quote string literals, see
  [Section 11.1.1, “String Literals”](string-literals.md "11.1.1 String Literals").

DBI information is available at the command line, online, or in
printed form:

- Once you have the `DBI` and
  `DBD::mysql` modules installed, you can get
  information about them at the command line with the
  `perldoc` command:

  ```terminal
  $> perldoc DBI
  $> perldoc DBI::FAQ
  $> perldoc DBD::mysql
  ```

  You can also use `pod2man`,
  `pod2html`, and so on to translate this
  information into other formats.
- For online information about Perl DBI, visit the DBI website,
  <http://dbi.perl.org/>. That site hosts a general
  DBI mailing list.
- For printed information, the official DBI book is
  *Programming the Perl DBI* (Alligator
  Descartes and Tim Bunce, O'Reilly & Associates, 2000).
  Information about the book is available at the DBI website,
