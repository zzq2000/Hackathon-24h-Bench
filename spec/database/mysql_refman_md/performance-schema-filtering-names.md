### 29.4.9 Naming Instruments or Consumers for Filtering Operations

Names given for filtering operations can be as specific or
general as required. To indicate a single instrument or
consumer, specify its name in full:

```sql
UPDATE performance_schema.setup_instruments
SET ENABLED = 'NO'
WHERE NAME = 'wait/synch/mutex/myisammrg/MYRG_INFO::mutex';

UPDATE performance_schema.setup_consumers
SET ENABLED = 'NO'
WHERE NAME = 'events_waits_current';
```

To specify a group of instruments or consumers, use a pattern
that matches the group members:

```sql
UPDATE performance_schema.setup_instruments
SET ENABLED = 'NO'
WHERE NAME LIKE 'wait/synch/mutex/%';

UPDATE performance_schema.setup_consumers
SET ENABLED = 'NO'
WHERE NAME LIKE '%history%';
```

If you use a pattern, it should be chosen so that it matches all
the items of interest and no others. For example, to select all
file I/O instruments, it is better to use a pattern that
includes the entire instrument name prefix:

```sql
... WHERE NAME LIKE 'wait/io/file/%';
```

A pattern of `'%/file/%'` matches other
instruments that have an element of `'/file/'`
anywhere in the name. Even less suitable is the pattern
`'%file%'` because it matches instruments with
`'file'` anywhere in the name, such as
`wait/synch/mutex/innodb/file_open_mutex`.

To check which instrument or consumer names a pattern matches,
perform a simple test:

```sql
SELECT NAME FROM performance_schema.setup_instruments
WHERE NAME LIKE 'pattern';

SELECT NAME FROM performance_schema.setup_consumers
WHERE NAME LIKE 'pattern';
```

For information about the types of names that are supported, see
[Section 29.6, “Performance Schema Instrument Naming Conventions”](performance-schema-instrument-naming.md "29.6 Performance Schema Instrument Naming Conventions").
