### 17.11.3 InnoDB Checkpoints

Making your [log files](glossary.md#glos_log_file "log file") very
large may reduce disk I/O during
[checkpointing](glossary.md#glos_checkpoint "checkpoint"). It often
makes sense to set the total size of the log files as large as the
buffer pool or even larger.

#### How Checkpoint Processing Works

`InnoDB` implements a
[checkpoint](glossary.md#glos_checkpoint "checkpoint") mechanism known
as [fuzzy
checkpointing](glossary.md#glos_fuzzy_checkpointing "fuzzy checkpointing"). `InnoDB` flushes modified
database pages from the buffer pool in small batches. There is no
need to flush the buffer pool in one single batch, which would
disrupt processing of user SQL statements during the checkpointing
process.

During [crash recovery](glossary.md#glos_crash_recovery "crash recovery"),
`InnoDB` looks for a checkpoint label written to
the log files. It knows that all modifications to the database
before the label are present in the disk image of the database.
Then `InnoDB` scans the log files forward from
the checkpoint, applying the logged modifications to the database.
