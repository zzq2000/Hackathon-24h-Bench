### 15.1.32 DROP TABLE Statement

```sql
DROP [TEMPORARY] TABLE [IF EXISTS]
    tbl_name [, tbl_name] ...
    [RESTRICT | CASCADE]
```

[`DROP TABLE`](drop-table.md "15.1.32 DROP TABLE Statement") removes one or more
tables. You must have the [`DROP`](privileges-provided.md#priv_drop)
privilege for each table.

*Be careful* with this statement! For each
table, it removes the table definition and all table data. If the
table is partitioned, the statement removes the table definition,
all its partitions, all data stored in those partitions, and all
partition definitions associated with the dropped table.

Dropping a table also drops any triggers for the table.

[`DROP TABLE`](drop-table.md "15.1.32 DROP TABLE Statement") causes an implicit
commit, except when used with the `TEMPORARY`
keyword. See [Section 15.3.3, “Statements That Cause an Implicit Commit”](implicit-commit.md "15.3.3 Statements That Cause an Implicit Commit").

Important

When a table is dropped, privileges granted specifically for the
table are *not* automatically dropped. They
must be dropped manually. See [Section 15.7.1.6, “GRANT Statement”](grant.md "15.7.1.6 GRANT Statement").

If any tables named in the argument list do not exist,
[`DROP TABLE`](drop-table.md "15.1.32 DROP TABLE Statement") behavior depends on
whether the `IF EXISTS` clause is given:

- Without `IF EXISTS`, the statement fails with
  an error indicating which nonexisting tables it was unable to
  drop, and no changes are made.
- With `IF EXISTS`, no error occurs for
  nonexisting tables. The statement drops all named tables that
  do exist, and generates a `NOTE` diagnostic
  for each nonexistent table. These notes can be displayed with
  [`SHOW WARNINGS`](show-warnings.md "15.7.7.42 SHOW WARNINGS Statement"). See
  [Section 15.7.7.42, “SHOW WARNINGS Statement”](show-warnings.md "15.7.7.42 SHOW WARNINGS Statement").

`IF EXISTS` can also be useful for dropping
tables in unusual circumstances under which there is an entry in
the data dictionary but no table managed by the storage engine.
(For example, if an abnormal server exit occurs after removal of
the table from the storage engine but before removal of the data
dictionary entry.)

The `TEMPORARY` keyword has the following
effects:

- The statement drops only `TEMPORARY` tables.
- The statement does not cause an implicit commit.
- No access rights are checked. A `TEMPORARY`
  table is visible only with the session that created it, so no
  check is necessary.

Including the `TEMPORARY` keyword is a good way
to prevent accidentally dropping non-`TEMPORARY`
tables.

The `RESTRICT` and `CASCADE`
keywords do nothing. They are permitted to make porting easier
from other database systems.

[`DROP TABLE`](drop-table.md "15.1.32 DROP TABLE Statement") is not supported with
all [`innodb_force_recovery`](innodb-parameters.md#sysvar_innodb_force_recovery)
settings. See [Section 17.21.3, “Forcing InnoDB Recovery”](forcing-innodb-recovery.md "17.21.3 Forcing InnoDB Recovery").
