### 13.2.9 2-Digit Years in Dates

Date values with 2-digit years are ambiguous because the century
is unknown. Such values must be interpreted into 4-digit form
because MySQL stores years internally using 4 digits.

For [`DATETIME`](datetime.md "13.2.2 The DATE, DATETIME, and TIMESTAMP Types"),
[`DATE`](datetime.md "13.2.2 The DATE, DATETIME, and TIMESTAMP Types"), and
[`TIMESTAMP`](datetime.md "13.2.2 The DATE, DATETIME, and TIMESTAMP Types") types, MySQL interprets
dates specified with ambiguous year values using these rules:

- Year values in the range `00-69` become
  `2000-2069`.
- Year values in the range `70-99` become
  `1970-1999`.

For `YEAR`, the rules are the same, with this
exception: A numeric `00` inserted into
`YEAR` results in `0000`
rather than `2000`. To specify zero for
`YEAR` and have it be interpreted as
`2000`, specify it as a string
`'0'` or `'00'`.

Remember that these rules are only heuristics that provide
reasonable guesses as to what your data values mean. If the
rules used by MySQL do not produce the values you require, you
must provide unambiguous input containing 4-digit year values.

`ORDER BY` properly sorts
[`YEAR`](year.md "13.2.4 The YEAR Type") values that have 2-digit
years.

Some functions like [`MIN()`](aggregate-functions.md#function_min) and
[`MAX()`](aggregate-functions.md#function_max) convert a
[`YEAR`](year.md "13.2.4 The YEAR Type") to a number. This means that
a value with a 2-digit year does not work properly with these
functions. The fix in this case is to convert the
[`YEAR`](year.md "13.2.4 The YEAR Type") to 4-digit year format.
