### 8.3.1 Configuring MySQL to Use Encrypted Connections

Several configuration parameters are available to indicate whether
to use encrypted connections, and to specify the appropriate
certificate and key files. This section provides general guidance
about configuring the server and clients for encrypted
connections:

- [Server-Side Startup Configuration for Encrypted Connections](using-encrypted-connections.md#using-encrypted-connections-server-side-startup-configuration "Server-Side Startup Configuration for Encrypted Connections")
- [Server-Side Runtime Configuration and Monitoring for Encrypted
  Connections](using-encrypted-connections.md#using-encrypted-connections-server-side-runtime-configuration "Server-Side Runtime Configuration and Monitoring for Encrypted Connections")
- [Client-Side Configuration for Encrypted Connections](using-encrypted-connections.md#using-encrypted-connections-client-side-configuration "Client-Side Configuration for Encrypted Connections")
- [Configuring Encrypted Connections as Mandatory](using-encrypted-connections.md#mandatory-encrypted-connections "Configuring Encrypted Connections as Mandatory")

Encrypted connections also can be used in other contexts, as
discussed in these additional sections:

- Between source and replica replication servers. See
  [Section 19.3.1, “Setting Up Replication to Use Encrypted Connections”](replication-encrypted-connections.md "19.3.1 Setting Up Replication to Use Encrypted Connections").
- Among Group Replication servers. See
  [Section 20.6.2, “Securing Group Communication Connections with Secure Socket Layer (SSL)”](group-replication-secure-socket-layer-support-ssl.md "20.6.2 Securing Group Communication Connections with Secure Socket Layer (SSL)").
- By client programs that are based on the MySQL C API. See
  [Support for Encrypted Connections](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/c-api/8.0/en/c-api-encrypted-connections.html).

Instructions for creating any required certificate and key files
are available in [Section 8.3.3, “Creating SSL and RSA Certificates and Keys”](creating-ssl-rsa-files.md "8.3.3 Creating SSL and RSA Certificates and Keys").

#### Server-Side Startup Configuration for Encrypted Connections

On the server side, the [`--ssl`](server-options.md#option_mysqld_ssl)
option specifies that the server permits but does not require
encrypted connections. This option is enabled by default, so it
need not be specified explicitly.

To require that clients connect using encrypted connections,
enable the
[`require_secure_transport`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_require_secure_transport) system
variable. See [Configuring Encrypted Connections as Mandatory](using-encrypted-connections.md#mandatory-encrypted-connections "Configuring Encrypted Connections as Mandatory").

These system variables on the server side specify the
certificate and key files the server uses when permitting
clients to establish encrypted connections:

- [`ssl_ca`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_ssl_ca): The path name of
  the Certificate Authority (CA) certificate file.
  ([`ssl_capath`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_ssl_capath) is similar but
  specifies the path name of a directory of CA certificate
  files.)
- [`ssl_cert`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_ssl_cert): The path name of
  the server public key certificate file. This certificate can
  be sent to the client and authenticated against the CA
  certificate that it has.
- [`ssl_key`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_ssl_key): The path name of
  the server private key file.

For example, to enable the server for encrypted connections,
start it with these lines in the `my.cnf`
file, changing the file names as necessary:

```ini
[mysqld]
ssl_ca=ca.pem
ssl_cert=server-cert.pem
ssl_key=server-key.pem
```

To specify in addition that clients are required to use
encrypted connections, enable the
[`require_secure_transport`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_require_secure_transport) system
variable:

```ini
[mysqld]
ssl_ca=ca.pem
ssl_cert=server-cert.pem
ssl_key=server-key.pem
require_secure_transport=ON
```

Each certificate and key system variable names a file in PEM
format. Should you need to create the required certificate and
key files, see [Section 8.3.3, “Creating SSL and RSA Certificates and Keys”](creating-ssl-rsa-files.md "8.3.3 Creating SSL and RSA Certificates and Keys"). MySQL
servers compiled using OpenSSL can generate missing certificate
and key files automatically at startup. See
[Section 8.3.3.1, “Creating SSL and RSA Certificates and Keys using MySQL”](creating-ssl-rsa-files-using-mysql.md "8.3.3.1 Creating SSL and RSA Certificates and Keys using MySQL").
Alternatively, if you have a MySQL source distribution, you can
test your setup using the demonstration certificate and key
files in its `mysql-test/std_data` directory.

The server performs certificate and key file autodiscovery. If
no explicit encrypted-connection options are given other than
[`--ssl`](server-options.md#option_mysqld_ssl) (possibly along with
[`ssl_cipher`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_ssl_cipher)) to configure
encrypted connections, the server attempts to enable
encrypted-connection support automatically at startup:

- If the server discovers valid certificate and key files
  named `ca.pem`,
  `server-cert.pem`, and
  `server-key.pem` in the data directory,
  it enables support for encrypted connections by clients.
  (The files need not have been generated automatically; what
  matters is that they have those names and are valid.)
- If the server does not find valid certificate and key files
  in the data directory, it continues executing but without
  support for encrypted connections.

If the server automatically enables encrypted connection
support, it writes a note to the error log. If the server
discovers that the CA certificate is self-signed, it writes a
warning to the error log. (The certificate is self-signed if
created automatically by the server or manually using
[**mysql\_ssl\_rsa\_setup**](mysql-ssl-rsa-setup.md "6.4.3 mysql_ssl_rsa_setup — Create SSL/RSA Files").)

MySQL also provides these system variables for server-side
encrypted-connection control:

- [`ssl_cipher`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_ssl_cipher): The list of
  permissible ciphers for connection encryption.
- [`ssl_crl`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_ssl_crl): The path name of
  the file containing certificate revocation lists.
  ([`ssl_crlpath`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_ssl_crlpath) is similar but
  specifies the path name of a directory of certificate
  revocation-list files.)
- [`tls_version`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_tls_version),
  [`tls_ciphersuites`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_tls_ciphersuites): Which
  encryption protocols and ciphersuites the server permits for
  encrypted connections; see
  [Section 8.3.2, “Encrypted Connection TLS Protocols and Ciphers”](encrypted-connection-protocols-ciphers.md "8.3.2 Encrypted Connection TLS Protocols and Ciphers").
  For example, you can configure
  [`tls_version`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_tls_version) to prevent
  clients from using less-secure protocols.

If the server cannot create a valid TLS context from the system
variables for server-side encrypted-connection control, the
server executes without support for encrypted connections.

#### Server-Side Runtime Configuration and Monitoring for Encrypted Connections

Prior to MySQL 8.0.16, the
`tls_xxx` and
`ssl_xxx` system
variables that configure encrypted-connection support can be set
only at server startup. These system variables therefore
determine the TLS context the server uses for all new
connections.

As of MySQL 8.0.16, the
`tls_xxx` and
`ssl_xxx` system
variables are dynamic and can be set at runtime, not just at
startup. If changed with
[`SET
GLOBAL`](set-variable.md "15.7.6.1 SET Syntax for Variable Assignment"), the new values apply only until server
restart. If changed with
[`SET
PERSIST`](set-variable.md "15.7.6.1 SET Syntax for Variable Assignment"), the new values also carry over to subsequent
server restarts. See [Section 15.7.6.1, “SET Syntax for Variable Assignment”](set-variable.md "15.7.6.1 SET Syntax for Variable Assignment"). However,
runtime changes to these variables do not immediately affect the
TLS context for new connections, as explained later in this
section.

Along with the change in MySQL 8.0.16 that enables runtime
changes to the TLS context-related system variables, the server
enables runtime updates to the actual TLS context used for new
connections. This capability may be useful, for example, to
avoid restarting a MySQL server that has been running so long
that its SSL certificate has expired.

To create the initial TLS context, the server uses the values
that the context-related system variables have at startup. To
expose the context values, the server also initializes a set of
corresponding status variables. The following table shows the
system variables that define the TLS context and the
corresponding status variables that expose the currently active
context values.

**Table 8.12 System and Status Variables for Server Main Connection Interface TLS Context**

| System Variable Name | Corresponding Status Variable Name |
| --- | --- |
| [`ssl_ca`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_ssl_ca) | [`Current_tls_ca`](server-status-variables.md#statvar_Current_tls_ca) |
| [`ssl_capath`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_ssl_capath) | [`Current_tls_capath`](server-status-variables.md#statvar_Current_tls_capath) |
| [`ssl_cert`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_ssl_cert) | [`Current_tls_cert`](server-status-variables.md#statvar_Current_tls_cert) |
| [`ssl_cipher`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_ssl_cipher) | [`Current_tls_cipher`](server-status-variables.md#statvar_Current_tls_cipher) |
| [`ssl_crl`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_ssl_crl) | [`Current_tls_crl`](server-status-variables.md#statvar_Current_tls_crl) |
| [`ssl_crlpath`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_ssl_crlpath) | [`Current_tls_crlpath`](server-status-variables.md#statvar_Current_tls_crlpath) |
| [`ssl_key`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_ssl_key) | [`Current_tls_key`](server-status-variables.md#statvar_Current_tls_key) |
| [`tls_ciphersuites`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_tls_ciphersuites) | [`Current_tls_ciphersuites`](server-status-variables.md#statvar_Current_tls_ciphersuites) |
| [`tls_version`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_tls_version) | [`Current_tls_version`](server-status-variables.md#statvar_Current_tls_version) |

As of MySQL 8.0.21, those active TLS context values are also
exposed as properties in the Performance Schema
[`tls_channel_status`](performance-schema-tls-channel-status-table.md "29.12.21.9 The tls_channel_status Table") table, along
with the properties for any other active TLS contexts.

To reconfigure the TLS context at runtime, use this procedure:

1. Set each TLS context-related system variable that should be
   changed to its new value.
2. Execute [`ALTER INSTANCE RELOAD
   TLS`](alter-instance.md#alter-instance-reload-tls). This statement reconfigures the active TLS
   context from the current values of the TLS context-related
   system variables. It also sets the context-related status
   variables to reflect the new active context values. The
   statement requires the
   [`CONNECTION_ADMIN`](privileges-provided.md#priv_connection-admin) privilege.
3. New connections established after execution of
   [`ALTER INSTANCE RELOAD TLS`](alter-instance.md#alter-instance-reload-tls) use
   the new TLS context. Existing connections remain unaffected.
   If existing connections should be terminated, use the
   [`KILL`](kill.md "15.7.8.4 KILL Statement") statement.

The members of each pair of system and status variables may have
different values temporarily due to the way the reconfiguration
procedure works:

- Changes to the system variables prior to
  [`ALTER INSTANCE RELOAD TLS`](alter-instance.md#alter-instance-reload-tls) do
  not change the TLS context. At this point, those changes
  have no effect on new connections, and corresponding
  context-related system and status variables may have
  different values. This enables you to make any changes
  required to individual system variables, then update the
  active TLS context atomically with
  [`ALTER INSTANCE RELOAD TLS`](alter-instance.md#alter-instance-reload-tls)
  after all system variable changes have been made.
- After [`ALTER INSTANCE RELOAD
  TLS`](alter-instance.md#alter-instance-reload-tls), corresponding system and status variables
  have the same values. This remains true until the next
  change to the system variables.

In some cases, [`ALTER INSTANCE RELOAD
TLS`](alter-instance.md#alter-instance-reload-tls) by itself may suffice to reconfigure the TLS
context, without changing any system variables. Suppose that the
certificate in the file named by
[`ssl_cert`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_ssl_cert) has expired. It is
sufficient to replace the existing file contents with a
nonexpired certificate and execute [`ALTER
INSTANCE RELOAD TLS`](alter-instance.md#alter-instance-reload-tls) to cause the new file contents to
be read and used for new connections.

As of MySQL 8.0.21, the server implements independent
connection-encryption configuration for the administrative
connection interface. See
[Administrative Interface Support for Encrypted Connections](administrative-connection-interface.md#administrative-interface-encrypted-connections "Administrative Interface Support for Encrypted Connections").
In addition, [`ALTER INSTANCE RELOAD
TLS`](alter-instance.md#alter-instance-reload-tls) is extended with a `FOR CHANNEL`
clause that enables specifying the channel (interface) for which
to reload the TLS context. See [Section 15.1.5, “ALTER INSTANCE Statement”](alter-instance.md "15.1.5 ALTER INSTANCE Statement").
There are no status variables to expose the administrative
interface TLS context, but the Performance Schema
[`tls_channel_status`](performance-schema-tls-channel-status-table.md "29.12.21.9 The tls_channel_status Table") table exposes
TLS properties for both the main and administrative interfaces.
See
[Section 29.12.21.9, “The tls\_channel\_status Table”](performance-schema-tls-channel-status-table.md "29.12.21.9 The tls_channel_status Table").

Updating the main interface TLS context has these effects:

- The update changes the TLS context used for new connections
  on the main connection interface.
- The update also changes the TLS context used for new
  connections on the administrative interface unless some
  nondefault TLS parameter value is configured for that
  interface.
- The update does not affect the TLS context used by other
  enabled server plugins or components such as Group
  Replication or X Plugin:

  - To apply the main interface reconfiguration to Group
    Replication's group communication connections, which
    take their settings from the server's TLS
    context-related system variables, you must execute
    [`STOP GROUP_REPLICATION`](stop-group-replication.md "15.4.3.2 STOP GROUP_REPLICATION Statement")
    followed by [`START
    GROUP_REPLICATION`](start-group-replication.md "15.4.3.1 START GROUP_REPLICATION Statement") to stop and restart Group
    Replication.
  - X Plugin initializes its TLS context at plugin
    initialization as described at
    [Section 22.5.3, “Using Encrypted Connections with X Plugin”](x-plugin-encrypted-connections.md "22.5.3 Using Encrypted Connections with X Plugin"). This
    context does not change thereafter.

By default, the `RELOAD TLS` action rolls back
with an error and has no effect if the configuration values do
not permit creation of the new TLS context. The previous context
values continue to be used for new connections. If the optional
`NO ROLLBACK ON ERROR` clause is given and the
new context cannot be created, rollback does not occur. Instead,
a warning is generated and encryption is disabled for new
connections on the interface to which the statement applies.

Options that enable or disable encrypted connections on a
connection interface have an effect only at startup. For
example, the [`--ssl`](server-options.md#option_mysqld_ssl) and
[`--admin-ssl`](server-options.md#option_mysqld_admin-ssl) options affect only
at startup whether the main and administrative interfaces
support encrypted connections. Such options are ignored and have
no effect on the operation of [`ALTER
INSTANCE RELOAD TLS`](alter-instance.md#alter-instance-reload-tls) at runtime. For example, you can
use [`--ssl=OFF`](server-options.md#option_mysqld_ssl) to start the server
with encrypted connections disabled on the main interface, then
reconfigure TLS and execute [`ALTER INSTANCE
RELOAD TLS`](alter-instance.md#alter-instance-reload-tls) to enable encrypted connections at runtime.

#### Client-Side Configuration for Encrypted Connections

For a complete list of client options related to establishment
of encrypted connections, see
[Command Options for Encrypted Connections](connection-options.md#encrypted-connection-options "Command Options for Encrypted Connections").

By default, MySQL client programs attempt to establish an
encrypted connection if the server supports encrypted
connections, with further control available through the
[`--ssl-mode`](connection-options.md#option_general_ssl-mode) option:

- In the absence of an
  [`--ssl-mode`](connection-options.md#option_general_ssl-mode) option, clients
  attempt to connect using encryption, falling back to an
  unencrypted connection if an encrypted connection cannot be
  established. This is also the behavior with an explicit
  [`--ssl-mode=PREFERRED`](connection-options.md#option_general_ssl-mode) option.
- With [`--ssl-mode=REQUIRED`](connection-options.md#option_general_ssl-mode),
  clients require an encrypted connection and fail if one
  cannot be established.
- With [`--ssl-mode=DISABLED`](connection-options.md#option_general_ssl-mode),
  clients use an unencrypted connection.
- With [`--ssl-mode=VERIFY_CA`](connection-options.md#option_general_ssl-mode) or
  [`--ssl-mode=VERIFY_IDENTITY`](connection-options.md#option_general_ssl-mode),
  clients require an encrypted connection, and also perform
  verification against the server CA certificate and (with
  `VERIFY_IDENTITY`) against the server host
  name in its certificate.

Important

The default setting,
[`--ssl-mode=PREFERRED`](connection-options.md#option_general_ssl-mode), produces
an encrypted connection if the other default settings are
unchanged. However, to help prevent sophisticated
man-in-the-middle attacks, it is important for the client to
verify the server’s identity. The settings
[`--ssl-mode=VERIFY_CA`](connection-options.md#option_general_ssl-mode) and
[`--ssl-mode=VERIFY_IDENTITY`](connection-options.md#option_general_ssl-mode)
are a better choice than the default setting to help prevent
this type of attack. `VERIFY_CA` makes the
client check that the server’s certificate is valid.
`VERIFY_IDENTITY` makes the client check that
the server’s certificate is valid, and also makes the client
check that the host name the client is using matches the
identity in the server’s certificate. To implement one of
these settings, you must first ensure that the CA certificate
for the server is reliably available to all the clients that
use it in your environment, otherwise availability issues will
result. For this reason, they are not the default setting.

Attempts to establish an unencrypted connection fail if the
[`require_secure_transport`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_require_secure_transport) system
variable is enabled on the server side to cause the server to
require encrypted connections. See
[Configuring Encrypted Connections as Mandatory](using-encrypted-connections.md#mandatory-encrypted-connections "Configuring Encrypted Connections as Mandatory").

The following options on the client side identify the
certificate and key files clients use when establishing
encrypted connections to the server. They are similar to the
[`ssl_ca`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_ssl_ca),
[`ssl_cert`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_ssl_cert), and
[`ssl_key`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_ssl_key) system variables used
on the server side, but
[`--ssl-cert`](connection-options.md#option_general_ssl-cert) and
[`--ssl-key`](connection-options.md#option_general_ssl-key) identify the client
public and private key:

- [`--ssl-ca`](connection-options.md#option_general_ssl-ca): The path name of
  the Certificate Authority (CA) certificate file. This
  option, if used, must specify the same certificate used by
  the server. (`--ssl-capath` is similar but
  specifies the path name of a directory of CA certificate
  files.)
- [`--ssl-cert`](connection-options.md#option_general_ssl-cert): The path name of
  the client public key certificate file.
- [`--ssl-key`](connection-options.md#option_general_ssl-key): The path name of
  the client private key file.

For additional security relative to that provided by the default
encryption, clients can supply a CA certificate matching the one
used by the server and enable host name identity verification.
In this way, the server and client place their trust in the same
CA certificate and the client verifies that the host to which it
connected is the one intended:

- To specify the CA certificate, use
  [`--ssl-ca`](connection-options.md#option_general_ssl-ca) (or
  [`--ssl-capath`](connection-options.md#option_general_ssl-capath)), and specify
  [`--ssl-mode=VERIFY_CA`](connection-options.md#option_general_ssl-mode).
- To enable host name identity verification as well, use
  [`--ssl-mode=VERIFY_IDENTITY`](connection-options.md#option_general_ssl-mode)
  rather than
  [`--ssl-mode=VERIFY_CA`](connection-options.md#option_general_ssl-mode).

Note

Host name identity verification with
`VERIFY_IDENTITY` does not work with
self-signed certificates that are created automatically by the
server or manually using
[**mysql\_ssl\_rsa\_setup**](mysql-ssl-rsa-setup.md "6.4.3 mysql_ssl_rsa_setup — Create SSL/RSA Files") (see
[Section 8.3.3.1, “Creating SSL and RSA Certificates and Keys using MySQL”](creating-ssl-rsa-files-using-mysql.md "8.3.3.1 Creating SSL and RSA Certificates and Keys using MySQL")). Such
self-signed certificates do not contain the server name as the
Common Name value.

Prior to MySQL 8.0.12, host name identity verification also
does not work with certificates that specify the Common Name
using wildcards because that name is compared verbatim to the
server name.

MySQL also provides these options for client-side
encrypted-connection control:

- [`--ssl-cipher`](connection-options.md#option_general_ssl-cipher): The list of
  permissible ciphers for connection encryption.
- [`--ssl-crl`](connection-options.md#option_general_ssl-crl): The path name of
  the file containing certificate revocation lists.
  (`--ssl-crlpath` is similar but specifies the
  path name of a directory of certificate revocation-list
  files.)
- [`--tls-version`](connection-options.md#option_general_tls-version),
  [`--tls-ciphersuites`](connection-options.md#option_general_tls-ciphersuites): The
  permitted encryption protocols and ciphersuites; see
  [Section 8.3.2, “Encrypted Connection TLS Protocols and Ciphers”](encrypted-connection-protocols-ciphers.md "8.3.2 Encrypted Connection TLS Protocols and Ciphers").

Depending on the encryption requirements of the MySQL account
used by a client, the client may be required to specify certain
options to connect using encryption to the MySQL server.

Suppose that you want to connect using an account that has no
special encryption requirements or that was created using a
[`CREATE USER`](create-user.md "15.7.1.3 CREATE USER Statement") statement that
included the `REQUIRE SSL` clause. Assuming
that the server supports encrypted connections, a client can
connect using encryption with no
[`--ssl-mode`](connection-options.md#option_general_ssl-mode) option or with an
explicit [`--ssl-mode=PREFERRED`](connection-options.md#option_general_ssl-mode)
option:

```terminal
mysql
```

Or:

```terminal
mysql --ssl-mode=PREFERRED
```

For an account created with a `REQUIRE SSL`
clause, the connection attempt fails if an encrypted connection
cannot be established. For an account with no special encryption
requirements, the attempt falls back to an unencrypted
connection if an encrypted connection cannot be established. To
prevent fallback and fail if an encrypted connection cannot be
obtained, connect like this:

```terminal
mysql --ssl-mode=REQUIRED
```

If the account has more stringent security requirements, other
options must be specified to establish an encrypted connection:

- For accounts created with a `REQUIRE X509`
  clause, clients must specify at least
  [`--ssl-cert`](connection-options.md#option_general_ssl-cert) and
  [`--ssl-key`](connection-options.md#option_general_ssl-key). In addition,
  [`--ssl-ca`](connection-options.md#option_general_ssl-ca) (or
  [`--ssl-capath`](connection-options.md#option_general_ssl-capath)) is recommended
  so that the public certificate provided by the server can be
  verified. For example (enter the command on a single line):

  ```terminal
  mysql --ssl-ca=ca.pem
        --ssl-cert=client-cert.pem
        --ssl-key=client-key.pem
  ```
- For accounts created with a `REQUIRE
  ISSUER` or `REQUIRE SUBJECT`
  clause, the encryption requirements are the same as for
  `REQUIRE X509`, but the certificate must
  match the issue or subject, respectively, specified in the
  account definition.

For additional information about the `REQUIRE`
clause, see [Section 15.7.1.3, “CREATE USER Statement”](create-user.md "15.7.1.3 CREATE USER Statement").

MySQL servers can generate client certificate and key files that
clients can use to connect to MySQL server instances. See
[Section 8.3.3, “Creating SSL and RSA Certificates and Keys”](creating-ssl-rsa-files.md "8.3.3 Creating SSL and RSA Certificates and Keys").

Important

If a client connecting to a MySQL server instance uses an SSL
certificate with the `extendedKeyUsage`
extension (an X.509 v3 extension), the extended key usage must
include client authentication (`clientAuth`).
If the SSL certificate is only specified for server
authentication (`serverAuth`) and other
non-client certificate purposes, certificate verification
fails and the client connection to the MySQL server instance
fails. There is no `extendedKeyUsage`
extension in SSL certificates generated by MySQL Server (as
described in
[Section 8.3.3.1, “Creating SSL and RSA Certificates and Keys using MySQL”](creating-ssl-rsa-files-using-mysql.md "8.3.3.1 Creating SSL and RSA Certificates and Keys using MySQL")),
and SSL certificates created using the
**openssl** command following the instructions
in [Section 8.3.3.2, “Creating SSL Certificates and Keys Using openssl”](creating-ssl-files-using-openssl.md "8.3.3.2 Creating SSL Certificates and Keys Using openssl"). If you
use your own client certificate created in another way, ensure
any `extendedKeyUsage` extension includes
client authentication.

To prevent use of encryption and override other
`--ssl-xxx` options,
invoke the client program with
[`--ssl-mode=DISABLED`](connection-options.md#option_general_ssl-mode):

```terminal
mysql --ssl-mode=DISABLED
```

To determine whether the current connection with the server uses
encryption, check the session value of the
[`Ssl_cipher`](server-status-variables.md#statvar_Ssl_cipher) status variable. If
the value is empty, the connection is not encrypted. Otherwise,
the connection is encrypted and the value indicates the
encryption cipher. For example:

```sql
mysql> SHOW SESSION STATUS LIKE 'Ssl_cipher';
+---------------+---------------------------+
| Variable_name | Value                     |
+---------------+---------------------------+
| Ssl_cipher    | DHE-RSA-AES128-GCM-SHA256 |
+---------------+---------------------------+
```

For the [**mysql**](mysql.md "6.5.1 mysql — The MySQL Command-Line Client") client, an alternative is to
use the `STATUS` or `\s`
command and check the `SSL` line:

```sql
mysql> \s
...
SSL: Not in use
...
```

Or:

```sql
mysql> \s
...
SSL: Cipher in use is DHE-RSA-AES128-GCM-SHA256
...
```

#### Configuring Encrypted Connections as Mandatory

For some MySQL deployments it may be not only desirable but
mandatory to use encrypted connections (for example, to satisfy
regulatory requirements). This section discusses configuration
settings that enable you to do this. These levels of control are
available:

- You can configure the server to require that clients connect
  using encrypted connections.
- You can invoke individual client programs to require an
  encrypted connection, even if the server permits but does
  not require encryption.
- You can configure individual MySQL accounts to be usable
  only over encrypted connections.

To require that clients connect using encrypted connections,
enable the
[`require_secure_transport`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_require_secure_transport) system
variable. For example, put these lines in the server
`my.cnf` file:

```ini
[mysqld]
require_secure_transport=ON
```

Alternatively, to set and persist the value at runtime, use this
statement:

```sql
SET PERSIST require_secure_transport=ON;
```

[`SET
PERSIST`](set-variable.md "15.7.6.1 SET Syntax for Variable Assignment") sets a value for the running MySQL instance.
It also saves the value, causing it to be used for subsequent
server restarts. See [Section 15.7.6.1, “SET Syntax for Variable Assignment”](set-variable.md "15.7.6.1 SET Syntax for Variable Assignment").

With [`require_secure_transport`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_require_secure_transport)
enabled, client connections to the server are required to use
some form of secure transport, and the server permits only
TCP/IP connections that use SSL, or connections that use a
socket file (on Unix) or shared memory (on Windows). The server
rejects nonsecure connection attempts, which fail with an
[`ER_SECURE_TRANSPORT_REQUIRED`](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/mysql-errors/8.0/en/server-error-reference.html#error_er_secure_transport_required)
error.

To invoke a client program such that it requires an encrypted
connection whether or not the server requires encryption, use an
[`--ssl-mode`](connection-options.md#option_general_ssl-mode) option value of
`REQUIRED`, `VERIFY_CA`, or
`VERIFY_IDENTITY`. For example:

```terminal
mysql --ssl-mode=REQUIRED
mysqldump --ssl-mode=VERIFY_CA
mysqladmin --ssl-mode=VERIFY_IDENTITY
```

To configure a MySQL account to be usable only over encrypted
connections, include a `REQUIRE` clause in the
[`CREATE USER`](create-user.md "15.7.1.3 CREATE USER Statement") statement that
creates the account, specifying in that clause the encryption
characteristics you require. For example, to require an
encrypted connection and the use of a valid X.509 certificate,
use `REQUIRE X509`:

```sql
CREATE USER 'jeffrey'@'localhost' REQUIRE X509;
```

For additional information about the `REQUIRE`
clause, see [Section 15.7.1.3, “CREATE USER Statement”](create-user.md "15.7.1.3 CREATE USER Statement").

To modify existing accounts that have no encryption
requirements, use the [`ALTER USER`](alter-user.md "15.7.1.1 ALTER USER Statement")
statement.
