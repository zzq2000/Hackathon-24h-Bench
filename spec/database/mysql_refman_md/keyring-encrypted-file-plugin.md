#### 8.4.4.7 Using the keyring\_encrypted\_file Encrypted File-Based Keyring Plugin

Note

The `keyring_encrypted_file` plugin is an
extension included in MySQL Enterprise Edition, a commercial product. To learn
more about commercial products, see
<https://www.mysql.com/products/>.

The `keyring_encrypted_file` keyring plugin
stores keyring data in an encrypted, password-protected file
local to the server host.

As of MySQL 8.0.34, this plugin is deprecated and subject to
removal in a future release of MySQL. Instead, consider using
the `component_encrypted_keyring_file`
component for storing keyring data (see
[Section 8.4.4.5, “Using the component\_keyring\_encrypted\_file Encrypted File-Based Keyring
Component”](keyring-encrypted-file-component.md "8.4.4.5 Using the component_keyring_encrypted_file Encrypted File-Based Keyring Component")).

Warning

For encryption key management, the
`keyring_encrypted_file` plugin is not
intended as a regulatory compliance solution. Security
standards such as PCI, FIPS, and others require use of key
management systems to secure, manage, and protect encryption
keys in key vaults or hardware security modules (HSMs).

To install `keyring_encrypted_file`, use the
general instructions found in
[Section 8.4.4.3, “Keyring Plugin Installation”](keyring-plugin-installation.md "8.4.4.3 Keyring Plugin Installation"), together with the
configuration information specific to
`keyring_encrypted_file` found here.

To be usable during the server startup process,
`keyring_encrypted_file` must be loaded using
the [`--early-plugin-load`](server-options.md#option_mysqld_early-plugin-load) option.
To specify the password for encrypting the keyring data file,
set the
[`keyring_encrypted_file_password`](keyring-system-variables.md#sysvar_keyring_encrypted_file_password)
system variable. (The password is mandatory; if not specified at
server startup, `keyring_encrypted_file`
initialization fails.) The
[`keyring_encrypted_file_data`](keyring-system-variables.md#sysvar_keyring_encrypted_file_data)
system variable optionally configures the location of the file
used by the `keyring_encrypted_file` plugin for
data storage. The default value is platform specific. To
configure the file location explicitly, set the variable value
at startup. For example, use these lines in the server
`my.cnf` file, adjusting the
`.so` suffix and file location for your
platform as necessary and substituting your chosen password:

```ini
[mysqld]
early-plugin-load=keyring_encrypted_file.so
keyring_encrypted_file_data=/usr/local/mysql/mysql-keyring/keyring-encrypted
keyring_encrypted_file_password=password
```

Because the `my.cnf` file stores a password
when written as shown, it should have a restrictive mode and be
accessible only to the account used to run the MySQL server.

Keyring operations are transactional: The
`keyring_encrypted_file` plugin uses a backup
file during write operations to ensure that it can roll back to
the original file if an operation fails. The backup file has the
same name as the value of the
[`keyring_encrypted_file_data`](keyring-system-variables.md#sysvar_keyring_encrypted_file_data)
system variable with a suffix of `.backup`.

For additional information about the system variables used to
configure the `keyring_encrypted_file` plugin,
see [Section 8.4.4.19, “Keyring System Variables”](keyring-system-variables.md "8.4.4.19 Keyring System Variables").

To ensure that keys are flushed only when the correct keyring
storage file exists, `keyring_encrypted_file`
stores a SHA-256 checksum of the keyring in the file. Before
updating the file, the plugin verifies that it contains the
expected checksum. In addition,
`keyring_encrypted_file` encrypts file contents
using AES before writing the file, and decrypts file contents
after reading the file.

The `keyring_encrypted_file` plugin supports
the functions that comprise the standard MySQL Keyring service
interface. Keyring operations performed by those functions are
accessible at two levels:

- SQL interface: In SQL statements, call the functions
  described in
  [Section 8.4.4.15, “General-Purpose Keyring Key-Management Functions”](keyring-functions-general-purpose.md "8.4.4.15 General-Purpose Keyring Key-Management Functions").
- C interface: In C-language code, call the keyring service
  functions described in [Section 7.6.9.2, “The Keyring Service”](keyring-service.md "7.6.9.2 The Keyring Service").

Example (using the SQL interface):

```sql
SELECT keyring_key_generate('MyKey', 'AES', 32);
SELECT keyring_key_remove('MyKey');
```

For information about the characteristics of key values
permitted by `keyring_encrypted_file`, see
[Section 8.4.4.13, “Supported Keyring Key Types and Lengths”](keyring-key-types.md "8.4.4.13 Supported Keyring Key Types and Lengths").
