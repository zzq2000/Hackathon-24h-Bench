### 14.18.4 Position-Based Synchronization Functions

The functions listed in this section are used for controlling
position-based synchronization of source and replica servers in
MySQL Replication.

**Table 14.28 Positional Synchronization Functions**

| Name | Description | Introduced | Deprecated |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| [`MASTER_POS_WAIT()`](replication-functions-synchronization.md#function_master-pos-wait) | Block until the replica has read and applied all updates up to the specified position |  | 8.0.26 |
| [`SOURCE_POS_WAIT()`](replication-functions-synchronization.md#function_source-pos-wait) | Block until the replica has read and applied all updates up to the specified position | 8.0.26 |  |

- [`MASTER_POS_WAIT(log_name,log_pos[,timeout][,channel])`](replication-functions-synchronization.md#function_master-pos-wait)

  This function is for control of source-replica
  synchronization. It blocks until the replica has read and
  applied all updates up to the specified position in the
  source's binary log. From MySQL 8.0.26,
  [`MASTER_POS_WAIT()`](replication-functions-synchronization.md#function_master-pos-wait) is
  deprecated and the alias
  [`SOURCE_POS_WAIT()`](replication-functions-synchronization.md#function_source-pos-wait) should be
  used instead. In releases before MySQL 8.0.26, use
  [`MASTER_POS_WAIT()`](replication-functions-synchronization.md#function_master-pos-wait).

  The return value is the number of log events the replica had
  to wait for to advance to the specified position. The
  function returns `NULL` if the replication
  SQL thread is not started, the replica's source information
  is not initialized, the arguments are incorrect, or an error
  occurs. It returns `-1` if the timeout has
  been exceeded. If the replication SQL thread stops while
  [`MASTER_POS_WAIT()`](replication-functions-synchronization.md#function_master-pos-wait) is waiting,
  the function returns `NULL`. If the replica
  is past the specified position, the function returns
  immediately.

  If the binary log file position has been marked as invalid,
  the function waits until a valid file position is known. The
  binary log file position can be marked as invalid when the
  [`CHANGE REPLICATION SOURCE TO`](change-replication-source-to.md "15.4.2.3 CHANGE REPLICATION SOURCE TO Statement")
  option `GTID_ONLY` is set for the
  replication channel, and the server is restarted or
  replication is stopped. The file position becomes valid
  after a transaction is successfully applied past the given
  file position. If the applier does not reach the stated
  position, the function waits until the timeout. Use a
  [`SHOW REPLICA STATUS`](show-replica-status.md "15.7.7.35 SHOW REPLICA STATUS Statement") statement
  to check if the binary log file position has been marked as
  invalid.

  On a multithreaded replica, the function waits until expiry
  of the limit set by the
  [`replica_checkpoint_group`](replication-options-replica.md#sysvar_replica_checkpoint_group),
  [`slave_checkpoint_group`](replication-options-replica.md#sysvar_slave_checkpoint_group),
  [`replica_checkpoint_period`](replication-options-replica.md#sysvar_replica_checkpoint_period)
  or [`slave_checkpoint_period`](replication-options-replica.md#sysvar_slave_checkpoint_period)
  system variable, when the checkpoint operation is called to
  update the status of the replica. Depending on the setting
  for the system variables, the function might therefore
  return some time after the specified position was reached.

  If binary log transaction compression is in use and the
  transaction payload at the specified position is compressed
  (as a `Transaction_payload_event`), the
  function waits until the whole transaction has been read and
  applied, and the positions have updated.

  If a *`timeout`* value is specified,
  [`MASTER_POS_WAIT()`](replication-functions-synchronization.md#function_master-pos-wait) stops
  waiting when *`timeout`* seconds have
  elapsed. *`timeout`* must be greater
  than or equal to 0. (When the server is running in strict
  SQL mode, a negative *`timeout`*
  value is immediately rejected with
  [`ER_WRONG_ARGUMENTS`](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/mysql-errors/8.0/en/server-error-reference.html#error_er_wrong_arguments);
  otherwise the function returns **`NULL`**,
  and raises a warning.)

  The optional *`channel`* value
  enables you to name which replication channel the function
  applies to. See [Section 19.2.2, “Replication Channels”](replication-channels.md "19.2.2 Replication Channels") for
  more information.

  This function is unsafe for statement-based replication. A
  warning is logged if you use this function when
  [`binlog_format`](replication-options-binary-log.md#sysvar_binlog_format) is set to
  `STATEMENT`.
- [`SOURCE_POS_WAIT(log_name,log_pos[,timeout][,channel])`](replication-functions-synchronization.md#function_source-pos-wait)

  This function is for control of source-replica
  synchronization. It blocks until the replica has read and
  applied all updates up to the specified position in the
  source's binary log. From MySQL 8.0.26, use
  [`SOURCE_POS_WAIT()`](replication-functions-synchronization.md#function_source-pos-wait) in place of
  [`MASTER_POS_WAIT()`](replication-functions-synchronization.md#function_master-pos-wait), which is
  deprecated from that release. In releases before MySQL
  8.0.26, use
  [`MASTER_POS_WAIT()`](replication-functions-synchronization.md#function_master-pos-wait).

  The return value is the number of log events the replica had
  to wait for to advance to the specified position. The
  function returns `NULL` if the replication
  SQL thread is not started, the replica's source information
  is not initialized, the arguments are incorrect, or an error
  occurs. It returns `-1` if the timeout has
  been exceeded. If the replication SQL thread stops while
  [`SOURCE_POS_WAIT()`](replication-functions-synchronization.md#function_source-pos-wait) is waiting,
  the function returns `NULL`. If the replica
  is past the specified position, the function returns
  immediately.

  If the binary log file position has been marked as invalid,
  the function waits until a valid file position is known. The
  binary log file position can be marked as invalid when the
  [`CHANGE REPLICATION SOURCE TO`](change-replication-source-to.md "15.4.2.3 CHANGE REPLICATION SOURCE TO Statement")
  option `GTID_ONLY` is set for the
  replication channel, and the server is restarted or
  replication is stopped. The file position becomes valid
  after a transaction is successfully applied past the given
  file position. If the applier does not reach the stated
  position, the function waits until the timeout. Use a
  [`SHOW REPLICA STATUS`](show-replica-status.md "15.7.7.35 SHOW REPLICA STATUS Statement") statement
  to check if the binary log file position has been marked as
  invalid.

  On a multithreaded replica, the function waits until expiry
  of the limit set by the
  [`replica_checkpoint_group`](replication-options-replica.md#sysvar_replica_checkpoint_group) or
  [`replica_checkpoint_period`](replication-options-replica.md#sysvar_replica_checkpoint_period)
  system variable, when the checkpoint operation is called to
  update the status of the replica. Depending on the setting
  for the system variables, the function might therefore
  return some time after the specified position was reached.

  If binary log transaction compression is in use and the
  transaction payload at the specified position is compressed
  (as a `Transaction_payload_event`), the
  function waits until the whole transaction has been read and
  applied, and the positions have updated.

  If a *`timeout`* value is specified,
  [`SOURCE_POS_WAIT()`](replication-functions-synchronization.md#function_source-pos-wait) stops
  waiting when *`timeout`* seconds have
  elapsed. *`timeout`* must be greater
  than or equal to 0. (In strict SQL mode, a negative
  *`timeout`* value is immediately
  rejected with
  [`ER_WRONG_ARGUMENTS`](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/mysql-errors/8.0/en/server-error-reference.html#error_er_wrong_arguments);
  otherwise the function returns `NULL`, and
  raises a warning.)

  The optional *`channel`* value
  enables you to name which replication channel the function
  applies to. See [Section 19.2.2, “Replication Channels”](replication-channels.md "19.2.2 Replication Channels") for
  more information.

  This function is unsafe for statement-based replication. A
  warning is logged if you use this function when
  [`binlog_format`](replication-options-binary-log.md#sysvar_binlog_format) is set to
  `STATEMENT`.
