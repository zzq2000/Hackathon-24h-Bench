## 10.7 Optimizing for MEMORY Tables

Consider using `MEMORY` tables for noncritical
data that is accessed often, and is read-only or rarely updated.
Benchmark your application against equivalent
`InnoDB` or `MyISAM` tables
under a realistic workload, to confirm that any additional
performance is worth the risk of losing data, or the overhead of
copying data from a disk-based table at application start.

For best performance with `MEMORY` tables,
examine the kinds of queries against each table, and specify the
type to use for each associated index, either a B-tree index or a
hash index. On the [`CREATE INDEX`](create-index.md "15.1.15 CREATE INDEX Statement")
statement, use the clause `USING BTREE` or
`USING HASH`. B-tree indexes are fast for queries
that do greater-than or less-than comparisons through operators
such as `>` or `BETWEEN`.
Hash indexes are only fast for queries that look up single values
through the `=` operator, or a restricted set of
values through the `IN` operator. For why
`USING BTREE` is often a better choice than the
default `USING HASH`, see
[Section 10.2.1.23, “Avoiding Full Table Scans”](table-scan-avoidance.md "10.2.1.23 Avoiding Full Table Scans"). For implementation details
of the different types of `MEMORY` indexes, see
[Section 10.3.9, “Comparison of B-Tree and Hash Indexes”](index-btree-hash.md "10.3.9 Comparison of B-Tree and Hash Indexes").
