#### 29.12.20.4 Statement Histogram Summary Tables

The Performance Schema maintains statement event summary
tables that contain information about minimum, maximum, and
average statement latency (see
[Section 29.12.20.3, “Statement Summary Tables”](performance-schema-statement-summary-tables.md "29.12.20.3 Statement Summary Tables")).
Those tables permit high-level assessment of system
performance. To permit assessment at a more fine-grained
level, the Performance Schema also collects histogram data for
statement latencies. These histograms provide additional
insight into latency distributions.

[Section 29.12.6, “Performance Schema Statement Event Tables”](performance-schema-statement-tables.md "29.12.6 Performance Schema Statement Event Tables")
describes the events on which statement summaries are based.
See that discussion for information about the content of
statement events, the current and historical statement event
tables, and how to control statement event collection, which
is partially disabled by default.

Example statement histogram information:

```sql
mysql> SELECT *
       FROM performance_schema.events_statements_histogram_by_digest
       WHERE SCHEMA_NAME = 'mydb' AND DIGEST = 'bb3f69453119b2d7b3ae40673a9d4c7c'
       AND COUNT_BUCKET > 0 ORDER BY BUCKET_NUMBER\G
*************************** 1. row ***************************
           SCHEMA_NAME: mydb
                DIGEST: bb3f69453119b2d7b3ae40673a9d4c7c
         BUCKET_NUMBER: 42
      BUCKET_TIMER_LOW: 66069344
     BUCKET_TIMER_HIGH: 69183097
          COUNT_BUCKET: 1
COUNT_BUCKET_AND_LOWER: 1
       BUCKET_QUANTILE: 0.058824
*************************** 2. row ***************************
           SCHEMA_NAME: mydb
                DIGEST: bb3f69453119b2d7b3ae40673a9d4c7c
         BUCKET_NUMBER: 43
      BUCKET_TIMER_LOW: 69183097
     BUCKET_TIMER_HIGH: 72443596
          COUNT_BUCKET: 1
COUNT_BUCKET_AND_LOWER: 2
       BUCKET_QUANTILE: 0.117647
*************************** 3. row ***************************
           SCHEMA_NAME: mydb
                DIGEST: bb3f69453119b2d7b3ae40673a9d4c7c
         BUCKET_NUMBER: 44
      BUCKET_TIMER_LOW: 72443596
     BUCKET_TIMER_HIGH: 75857757
          COUNT_BUCKET: 2
COUNT_BUCKET_AND_LOWER: 4
       BUCKET_QUANTILE: 0.235294
*************************** 4. row ***************************
           SCHEMA_NAME: mydb
                DIGEST: bb3f69453119b2d7b3ae40673a9d4c7c
         BUCKET_NUMBER: 45
      BUCKET_TIMER_LOW: 75857757
     BUCKET_TIMER_HIGH: 79432823
          COUNT_BUCKET: 6
COUNT_BUCKET_AND_LOWER: 10
       BUCKET_QUANTILE: 0.625000
...
```

For example, in row 3, these values indicate that 23.52% of
queries run in under 75.86 microseconds:

```sql
BUCKET_TIMER_HIGH: 75857757
  BUCKET_QUANTILE: 0.235294
```

In row 4, these values indicate that 62.50% of queries run in
under 79.44 microseconds:

```sql
BUCKET_TIMER_HIGH: 79432823
  BUCKET_QUANTILE: 0.625000
```

Each statement histogram summary table has one or more
grouping columns to indicate how the table aggregates events:

- [`events_statements_histogram_by_digest`](performance-schema-statement-histogram-summary-tables.md "29.12.20.4 Statement Histogram Summary Tables")
  has `SCHEMA_NAME`,
  `DIGEST`, and
  `BUCKET_NUMBER` columns:

  - The `SCHEMA_NAME` and
    `DIGEST` columns identify a statement
    digest row in the
    [`events_statements_summary_by_digest`](performance-schema-statement-summary-tables.md "29.12.20.3 Statement Summary Tables")
    table.
  - The
    [`events_statements_histogram_by_digest`](performance-schema-statement-histogram-summary-tables.md "29.12.20.4 Statement Histogram Summary Tables")
    rows with the same `SCHEMA_NAME` and
    `DIGEST` values comprise the
    histogram for that schema/digest combination.
  - Within a given histogram, the
    `BUCKET_NUMBER` column indicates the
    bucket number.
- [`events_statements_histogram_global`](performance-schema-statement-histogram-summary-tables.md "29.12.20.4 Statement Histogram Summary Tables")
  has a `BUCKET_NUMBER` column. This table
  summarizes latencies globally across schema name and
  digest values, using a single histogram. The
  `BUCKET_NUMBER` column indicates the
  bucket number within this global histogram.

A histogram consists of *`N`* buckets,
where each row represents one bucket, with the bucket number
indicated by the `BUCKET_NUMBER` column.
Bucket numbers begin with 0.

Each statement histogram summary table has these summary
columns containing aggregated values:

- `BUCKET_TIMER_LOW`,
  `BUCKET_TIMER_HIGH`

  A bucket counts statements that have a latency, in
  picoseconds, measured between
  `BUCKET_TIMER_LOW` and
  `BUCKET_TIMER_HIGH`:

  - The value of `BUCKET_TIMER_LOW` for
    the first bucket (`BUCKET_NUMBER` =
    0) is 0.
  - The value of `BUCKET_TIMER_LOW` for a
    bucket (`BUCKET_NUMBER` =
    *`k`*) is the same as
    `BUCKET_TIMER_HIGH` for the previous
    bucket (`BUCKET_NUMBER` =
    *`k`*−1)
  - The last bucket is a catchall for statements that have
    a latency exceeding previous buckets in the histogram.
- `COUNT_BUCKET`

  The number of statements measured with a latency in the
  interval from `BUCKET_TIMER_LOW` up to
  but not including `BUCKET_TIMER_HIGH`.
- `COUNT_BUCKET_AND_LOWER`

  The number of statements measured with a latency in the
  interval from 0 up to but not including
  `BUCKET_TIMER_HIGH`.
- `BUCKET_QUANTILE`

  The proportion of statements that fall into this or a
  lower bucket. This proportion corresponds by definition to
  `COUNT_BUCKET_AND_LOWER /
  SUM(COUNT_BUCKET)` and is displayed as a
  convenience column.

The statement histogram summary tables have these indexes:

- [`events_statements_histogram_by_digest`](performance-schema-statement-histogram-summary-tables.md "29.12.20.4 Statement Histogram Summary Tables"):

  - Unique index on (`SCHEMA_NAME`,
    `DIGEST`,
    `BUCKET_NUMBER`)
- [`events_statements_histogram_global`](performance-schema-statement-histogram-summary-tables.md "29.12.20.4 Statement Histogram Summary Tables"):

  - Primary key on (`BUCKET_NUMBER`)

[`TRUNCATE TABLE`](truncate-table.md "15.1.37 TRUNCATE TABLE Statement") is permitted for
statement histogram summary tables. Truncation sets the
`COUNT_BUCKET` and
`COUNT_BUCKET_AND_LOWER` columns to 0.

In addition, truncating
[`events_statements_summary_by_digest`](performance-schema-statement-summary-tables.md "29.12.20.3 Statement Summary Tables")
implicitly truncates
[`events_statements_histogram_by_digest`](performance-schema-statement-histogram-summary-tables.md "29.12.20.4 Statement Histogram Summary Tables"),
and truncating
[`events_statements_summary_global_by_event_name`](performance-schema-statement-summary-tables.md "29.12.20.3 Statement Summary Tables")
implicitly truncates
[`events_statements_histogram_global`](performance-schema-statement-histogram-summary-tables.md "29.12.20.4 Statement Histogram Summary Tables").
