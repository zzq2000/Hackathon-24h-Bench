#### 19.2.3.2 Monitoring Replication Applier Worker Threads

On a multithreaded replica, the Performance Schema tables
[`replication_applier_status_by_coordinator`](performance-schema-replication-applier-status-by-coordinator-table.md "29.12.11.4 The replication_applier_status_by_coordinator Table")
and
[`replication_applier_status_by_worker`](performance-schema-replication-applier-status-by-worker-table.md "29.12.11.5 The replication_applier_status_by_worker Table")
show status information for the replica's coordinator thread and
applier worker threads respectively. For a replica with multiple
channels, the threads for each channel are identified.

A multithreaded replica's coordinator thread also prints
statistics to the replica's error log on a regular basis if the
verbosity setting is set to display informational messages. The
statistics are printed depending on the volume of events that
the coordinator thread has assigned to applier worker threads,
with a maximum frequency of once every 120 seconds. The message
lists the following statistics for the relevant replication
channel, or the default replication channel (which is not
named):

Seconds elapsed
:   The difference in seconds between the current time and the
    last time this information was printed to the error log.

Events assigned
:   The total number of events that the coordinator thread has
    queued to all applier worker threads since the coordinator
    thread was started.

Worker queues filled over overrun level
:   The current number of events that are queued to any of the
    applier worker threads in excess of the overrun level,
    which is set at 90% of the maximum queue length of 16384
    events. If this value is zero, no applier worker threads
    are operating at the upper limit of their capacity.

Waited due to worker queue full
:   The number of times that the coordinator thread had to
    wait to schedule an event because an applier worker
    thread's queue was full. If this value is zero, no applier
    worker threads exhausted their capacity.

Waited due to the total size
:   The number of times that the coordinator thread had to
    wait to schedule an event because the
    [`replica_pending_jobs_size_max`](replication-options-replica.md#sysvar_replica_pending_jobs_size_max)
    or
    [`slave_pending_jobs_size_max`](replication-options-replica.md#sysvar_slave_pending_jobs_size_max)
    limit had been reached. This system variable sets the
    maximum amount of memory (in bytes) available to applier
    worker thread queues holding events not yet applied. If an
    unusually large event exceeds this size, the transaction
    is held until all the applier worker threads have empty
    queues, and then processed. All subsequent transactions
    are held until the large transaction has been completed.

Waited at clock conflicts
:   The number of nanoseconds that the coordinator thread had
    to wait to schedule an event because a transaction that
    the event depended on had not yet been committed. If
    [`replica_parallel_type`](replication-options-replica.md#sysvar_replica_parallel_type) or
    [`slave_parallel_type`](replication-options-replica.md#sysvar_slave_parallel_type) is
    set to `DATABASE` (rather than
    `LOGICAL_CLOCK`), this value is always
    zero.

Waited (count) when workers occupied
:   The number of times that the coordinator thread slept for
    a short period, which it might do in two situations. The
    first situation is where the coordinator thread assigns an
    event and finds the applier worker thread's queue is
    filled beyond the underrun level of 10% of the maximum
    queue length, in which case it sleeps for a maximum of 1
    millisecond. The second situation is where
    [`replica_parallel_type`](replication-options-replica.md#sysvar_replica_parallel_type) or
    [`slave_parallel_type`](replication-options-replica.md#sysvar_slave_parallel_type) is
    set to `LOGICAL_CLOCK` and the
    coordinator thread needs to assign the first event of a
    transaction to an applier worker thread's queue, it only
    does this to a worker with an empty queue, so if no queues
    are empty, the coordinator thread sleeps until one becomes
    empty.

Waited when workers occupied
:   The number of nanoseconds that the coordinator thread
    slept while waiting for an empty applier worker thread
    queue (that is, in the second situation described above,
    where
    [`replica_parallel_type`](replication-options-replica.md#sysvar_replica_parallel_type) or
    [`slave_parallel_type`](replication-options-replica.md#sysvar_slave_parallel_type) is
    set to `LOGICAL_CLOCK` and the first
    event of a transaction needs to be assigned).
