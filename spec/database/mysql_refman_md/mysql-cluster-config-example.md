#### 25.4.3.1 NDB Cluster Configuration: Basic Example

To support NDB Cluster, you should update
`my.cnf` as shown in the following example.
You may also specify these parameters on the command line when
invoking the executables.

Note

The options shown here should not be confused with those that
are used in `config.ini` global
configuration files. Global configuration options are
discussed later in this section.

```ini
# my.cnf
# example additions to my.cnf for NDB Cluster
# (valid in MySQL 8.0)

# enable ndbcluster storage engine, and provide connection string for
# management server host (default port is 1186)
[mysqld]
ndbcluster
ndb-connectstring=ndb_mgmd.mysql.com

# provide connection string for management server host (default port: 1186)
[ndbd]
connect-string=ndb_mgmd.mysql.com

# provide connection string for management server host (default port: 1186)
[ndb_mgm]
connect-string=ndb_mgmd.mysql.com

# provide location of cluster configuration file
# IMPORTANT: When starting the management server with this option in the
# configuration file, the use of --initial or --reload on the command line when
# invoking ndb_mgmd is also required.
[ndb_mgmd]
config-file=/etc/config.ini
```

(For more information on connection strings, see
[Section 25.4.3.3, “NDB Cluster Connection Strings”](mysql-cluster-connection-strings.md "25.4.3.3 NDB Cluster Connection Strings").)

```ini
# my.cnf
# example additions to my.cnf for NDB Cluster
# (works on all versions)

# enable ndbcluster storage engine, and provide connection string for management
# server host to the default port 1186
[mysqld]
ndbcluster
ndb-connectstring=ndb_mgmd.mysql.com:1186
```

Important

Once you have started a [**mysqld**](mysqld.md "6.3.1 mysqld — The MySQL Server") process with
the [`NDBCLUSTER`](mysql-cluster.md "Chapter 25 MySQL NDB Cluster 8.0") and
`ndb-connectstring` parameters in the
`[mysqld]` in the `my.cnf`
file as shown previously, you cannot execute any
[`CREATE TABLE`](create-table.md "15.1.20 CREATE TABLE Statement") or
[`ALTER TABLE`](alter-table.md "15.1.9 ALTER TABLE Statement") statements without
having actually started the cluster. Otherwise, these
statements fail with an error. *This is by
design*.

You may also use a separate `[mysql_cluster]`
section in the cluster `my.cnf` file for
settings to be read and used by all executables:

```ini
# cluster-specific settings
[mysql_cluster]
ndb-connectstring=ndb_mgmd.mysql.com:1186
```

For additional [`NDB`](mysql-cluster.md "Chapter 25 MySQL NDB Cluster 8.0") variables that
can be set in the `my.cnf` file, see
[Section 25.4.3.9.2, “NDB Cluster System Variables”](mysql-cluster-options-variables.md#mysql-cluster-system-variables "25.4.3.9.2 NDB Cluster System Variables").

The NDB Cluster global configuration file is by convention named
`config.ini` (but this is not required). If
needed, it is read by [**ndb\_mgmd**](mysql-cluster-programs-ndb-mgmd.md "25.5.4 ndb_mgmd — The NDB Cluster Management Server Daemon") at startup and
can be placed in any location that can be read by it. The
location and name of the configuration are specified using
[`--config-file=path_name`](mysql-cluster-programs-ndb-mgmd.md#option_ndb_mgmd_config-file)
with [**ndb\_mgmd**](mysql-cluster-programs-ndb-mgmd.md "25.5.4 ndb_mgmd — The NDB Cluster Management Server Daemon") on the command line. This
option has no default value, and is ignored if
[**ndb\_mgmd**](mysql-cluster-programs-ndb-mgmd.md "25.5.4 ndb_mgmd — The NDB Cluster Management Server Daemon") uses the configuration cache.

The global configuration file for NDB Cluster uses INI format,
which consists of sections preceded by section headings
(surrounded by square brackets), followed by the appropriate
parameter names and values. One deviation from the standard INI
format is that the parameter name and value can be separated by
a colon (`:`) as well as the equal sign
(`=`); however, the equal sign is preferred.
Another deviation is that sections are not uniquely identified
by section name. Instead, unique sections (such as two different
nodes of the same type) are identified by a unique ID specified
as a parameter within the section.

Default values are defined for most parameters, and can also be
specified in `config.ini`. To create a
default value section, simply add the word
`default` to the section name. For example, an
`[ndbd]` section contains parameters that apply
to a particular data node, whereas an `[ndbd
default]` section contains parameters that apply to all
data nodes. Suppose that all data nodes should use the same data
memory size. To configure them all, create an `[ndbd
default]` section that contains a
[`DataMemory`](mysql-cluster-ndbd-definition.md#ndbparam-ndbd-datamemory) line to
specify the data memory size.

If used, the `[ndbd default]` section must
precede any `[ndbd]` sections in the
configuration file. This is also true for
`default` sections of any other type.

Note

In some older releases of NDB Cluster, there was no default
value for
[`NoOfReplicas`](mysql-cluster-ndbd-definition.md#ndbparam-ndbd-noofreplicas), which
always had to be specified explicitly in the `[ndbd
default]` section. Although this parameter now has a
default value of 2, which is the recommended setting in most
common usage scenarios, it is still recommended practice to
set this parameter explicitly.

The global configuration file must define the computers and
nodes involved in the cluster and on which computers these nodes
are located. An example of a simple configuration file for a
cluster consisting of one management server, two data nodes and
two MySQL servers is shown here:

```ini
# file "config.ini" - 2 data nodes and 2 SQL nodes
# This file is placed in the startup directory of ndb_mgmd (the
# management server)
# The first MySQL Server can be started from any host. The second
# can be started only on the host mysqld_5.mysql.com

[ndbd default]
NoOfReplicas= 2
DataDir= /var/lib/mysql-cluster

[ndb_mgmd]
Hostname= ndb_mgmd.mysql.com
DataDir= /var/lib/mysql-cluster

[ndbd]
HostName= ndbd_2.mysql.com

[ndbd]
HostName= ndbd_3.mysql.com

[mysqld]
[mysqld]
HostName= mysqld_5.mysql.com
```

Note

The preceding example is intended as a minimal starting
configuration for purposes of familiarization with NDB Cluster
, and is almost certain not to be sufficient for production
settings. See [Section 25.4.3.2, “Recommended Starting Configuration for NDB Cluster”](mysql-cluster-config-starting.md "25.4.3.2 Recommended Starting Configuration for NDB Cluster"),
which provides a more complete example starting configuration.

Each node has its own section in the
`config.ini` file. For example, this cluster
has two data nodes, so the preceding configuration file contains
two `[ndbd]` sections defining these nodes.

Note

Do not place comments on the same line as a section heading in
the `config.ini` file; this causes the
management server not to start because it cannot parse the
configuration file in such cases.

##### Sections of the config.ini File

There are six different sections that you can use in the
`config.ini` configuration file, as described
in the following list:

- `[computer]`: Defines cluster hosts. This
  is not required to configure a viable NDB Cluster, but be
  may used as a convenience when setting up a large cluster.
  See [Section 25.4.3.4, “Defining Computers in an NDB Cluster”](mysql-cluster-computer-definition.md "25.4.3.4 Defining Computers in an NDB Cluster"), for
  more information.
- `[ndbd]`: Defines a cluster data node
  ([**ndbd**](mysql-cluster-programs-ndbd.md "25.5.1 ndbd — The NDB Cluster Data Node Daemon") process). See
  [Section 25.4.3.6, “Defining NDB Cluster Data Nodes”](mysql-cluster-ndbd-definition.md "25.4.3.6 Defining NDB Cluster Data Nodes"), for
  details.
- `[mysqld]`: Defines the cluster's MySQL
  server nodes (also called SQL or API nodes). For a
  discussion of SQL node configuration, see
  [Section 25.4.3.7, “Defining SQL and Other API Nodes in an NDB Cluster”](mysql-cluster-api-definition.md "25.4.3.7 Defining SQL and Other API Nodes in an NDB Cluster").
- `[mgm]` or `[ndb_mgmd]`:
  Defines a cluster management server (MGM) node. For
  information concerning the configuration of management
  nodes, see [Section 25.4.3.5, “Defining an NDB Cluster Management Server”](mysql-cluster-mgm-definition.md "25.4.3.5 Defining an NDB Cluster Management Server").
- `[tcp]`: Defines a TCP/IP connection
  between cluster nodes, with TCP/IP being the default
  transport protocol. Normally, `[tcp]` or
  `[tcp default]` sections are not required
  to set up an NDB Cluster, as the cluster handles this
  automatically; however, it may be necessary in some
  situations to override the defaults provided by the cluster.
  See [Section 25.4.3.10, “NDB Cluster TCP/IP Connections”](mysql-cluster-tcp-definition.md "25.4.3.10 NDB Cluster TCP/IP Connections"), for
  information about available TCP/IP configuration parameters
  and how to use them. (You may also find
  [Section 25.4.3.11, “NDB Cluster TCP/IP Connections Using Direct Connections”](mysql-cluster-tcp-definition-direct.md "25.4.3.11 NDB Cluster TCP/IP Connections Using Direct Connections") to be
  of interest in some cases.)
- `[shm]`: Defines shared-memory connections
  between nodes. In MySQL 8.0, it is enabled by
  default, but should still be considered experimental. For a
  discussion of SHM interconnects, see
  [Section 25.4.3.12, “NDB Cluster Shared-Memory Connections”](mysql-cluster-shm-definition.md "25.4.3.12 NDB Cluster Shared-Memory Connections").
- `[sci]`: Defines Scalable Coherent
  Interface connections between cluster data nodes. Not
  supported in NDB 8.0.

You can define `default` values for each
section. If used, a `default` section should
come before any other sections of that type. For example, an
`[ndbd default]` section should appear in the
configuration file before any `[ndbd]`
sections.

NDB Cluster parameter names are case-insensitive, unless
specified in MySQL Server `my.cnf` or
`my.ini` files.
