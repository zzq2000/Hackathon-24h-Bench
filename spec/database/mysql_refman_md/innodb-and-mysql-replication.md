## 17.19 InnoDB and MySQL Replication

It is possible to use replication in a way where the storage engine
on the replica is not the same as the storage engine on the source.
For example, you can replicate modifications to an
`InnoDB` table on the source to a
`MyISAM` table on the replica. For more information
see, [Section 19.4.4, “Using Replication with Different Source and Replica Storage Engines”](replication-solutions-diffengines.md "19.4.4 Using Replication with Different Source and Replica Storage Engines").

For information about setting up a replica, see
[Section 19.1.2.6, “Setting Up Replicas”](replication-setup-replicas.md "19.1.2.6 Setting Up Replicas"), and
[Section 19.1.2.5, “Choosing a Method for Data Snapshots”](replication-snapshot-method.md "19.1.2.5 Choosing a Method for Data Snapshots"). To make a new replica
without taking down the source or an existing replica, use the
[MySQL Enterprise Backup](mysql-enterprise-backup.md "32.1 MySQL Enterprise Backup Overview") product.

Transactions that fail on the source do not affect replication.
MySQL replication is based on the binary log where MySQL writes SQL
statements that modify data. A transaction that fails (for example,
because of a foreign key violation, or because it is rolled back) is
not written to the binary log, so it is not sent to replicas. See
[Section 15.3.1, “START TRANSACTION, COMMIT, and ROLLBACK Statements”](commit.md "15.3.1 START TRANSACTION, COMMIT, and ROLLBACK Statements").

**Replication and CASCADE.**
Cascading actions for `InnoDB` tables on the
source are executed on the replica *only* if
the tables sharing the foreign key relation use
`InnoDB` on both the source and replica. This is
true whether you are using statement-based or row-based
replication. Suppose that you have started replication, and then
create two tables on the source, where `InnoDB`
is defined as the default storage engine, using the following
[`CREATE TABLE`](create-table.md "15.1.20 CREATE TABLE Statement") statements:

```sql
CREATE TABLE fc1 (
    i INT PRIMARY KEY,
    j INT
);

CREATE TABLE fc2 (
    m INT PRIMARY KEY,
    n INT,
    FOREIGN KEY ni (n) REFERENCES fc1 (i)
        ON DELETE CASCADE
);
```

If the replica has `MyISAM` defined as the default
storage engine, the same tables are created on the replica, but they
use the `MyISAM` storage engine, and the
`FOREIGN KEY` option is ignored. Now we insert some
rows into the tables on the source:

```sql
source> INSERT INTO fc1 VALUES (1, 1), (2, 2);
Query OK, 2 rows affected (0.09 sec)
Records: 2  Duplicates: 0  Warnings: 0

source> INSERT INTO fc2 VALUES (1, 1), (2, 2), (3, 1);
Query OK, 3 rows affected (0.19 sec)
Records: 3  Duplicates: 0  Warnings: 0
```

At this point, on both the source and the replica, table
`fc1` contains 2 rows, and table
`fc2` contains 3 rows, as shown here:

```sql
source> SELECT * FROM fc1;
+---+------+
| i | j    |
+---+------+
| 1 |    1 |
| 2 |    2 |
+---+------+
2 rows in set (0.00 sec)

source> SELECT * FROM fc2;
+---+------+
| m | n    |
+---+------+
| 1 |    1 |
| 2 |    2 |
| 3 |    1 |
+---+------+
3 rows in set (0.00 sec)

replica> SELECT * FROM fc1;
+---+------+
| i | j    |
+---+------+
| 1 |    1 |
| 2 |    2 |
+---+------+
2 rows in set (0.00 sec)

replica> SELECT * FROM fc2;
+---+------+
| m | n    |
+---+------+
| 1 |    1 |
| 2 |    2 |
| 3 |    1 |
+---+------+
3 rows in set (0.00 sec)
```

Now suppose that you perform the following
[`DELETE`](delete.md "15.2.2 DELETE Statement") statement on the source:

```sql
source> DELETE FROM fc1 WHERE i=1;
Query OK, 1 row affected (0.09 sec)
```

Due to the cascade, table `fc2` on the source now
contains only 1 row:

```sql
source> SELECT * FROM fc2;
+---+---+
| m | n |
+---+---+
| 2 | 2 |
+---+---+
1 row in set (0.00 sec)
```

However, the cascade does not propagate on the replica because on
the replica the [`DELETE`](delete.md "15.2.2 DELETE Statement") for
`fc1` deletes no rows from `fc2`.
The replica's copy of `fc2` still contains all of
the rows that were originally inserted:

```sql
replica> SELECT * FROM fc2;
+---+---+
| m | n |
+---+---+
| 1 | 1 |
| 3 | 1 |
| 2 | 2 |
+---+---+
3 rows in set (0.00 sec)
```

This difference is due to the fact that the cascading deletes are
handled internally by the `InnoDB` storage engine,
which means that none of the changes are logged.
