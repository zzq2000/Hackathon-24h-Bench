#### 20.1.3.1 Single-Primary Mode

In single-primary mode
([`group_replication_single_primary_mode=ON`](group-replication-system-variables.md#sysvar_group_replication_single_primary_mode))
the group has a single primary server that is set to read/write
mode. All the other members in the group are set to read-only
mode (with [`super_read_only=ON`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_super_read_only)).
The primary typically bootstraps the entire group. All other
servers that join the group learn about the primary server and
are automatically set to read-only mode.

In single-primary mode, Group Replication enforces that only a
single server writes to the group, so compared to multi-primary
mode, consistency checking can be less strict and DDL statements
do not need to be handled with any extra care. The option
[`group_replication_enforce_update_everywhere_checks`](group-replication-system-variables.md#sysvar_group_replication_enforce_update_everywhere_checks)
enables or disables strict consistency checks for a group. When
deploying in single-primary mode, or changing the group to
single-primary mode, this system variable must be set to
`OFF`.

The member that is designated as the primary server can change
in the following ways:

- If the existing primary leaves the group, whether
  voluntarily or unexpectedly, a new primary is elected
  automatically.
- You can appoint a specific member as the new primary using
  the
  [`group_replication_set_as_primary()`](group-replication-functions-for-new-primary.md#function_group-replication-set-as-primary)
  function.
- If you use the
  [`group_replication_switch_to_single_primary_mode()`](group-replication-functions-for-mode.md#function_group-replication-switch-to-single-primary-mode)
  function to change a group that was running in
  multi-primary mode to run in single-primary mode, a new
  primary is elected automatically, or you can appoint the
  new primary by specifying it with the function.

These functions can be used only when all group members are
running MySQL 8.0.13 or later.

When a new primary server is elected (automatically or
manually), it is automatically set to read/write, and the other
group members remain as secondaries, and as such, read-only. The
following diagram shows this process:

**Figure 20.4 New Primary Election**

![Five server instances, S1, S2, S3, S4, and S5, are deployed as an interconnected group. Server S1 is the primary. Write clients are communicating with server S1, and a read client is communicating with server S4. Server S1 then fails, breaking communication with the write clients. Server S2 then takes over as the new primary, and the write clients now communicate with server S2.](images/single-primary-election.png)

When a new primary is chosen, it might have a backlog of changes
that had been applied on the old primary but have not yet been
applied on the new one. In this case, until the new primary
catches up with the old one, read/write transactions might
result in conflicts and be rolled back, and read-only
transactions might result in stale reads. The Group Replication
flow control mechanism minimizes the difference between fast and
slow members, and so reduces the chances of this happening if it
is activated and properly tuned. For more information on flow
control, see [Section 20.7.2, “Flow Control”](group-replication-flow-control.md "20.7.2 Flow Control").
In MySQL 8.0.14 and later, you can also use the
[`group_replication_consistency`](group-replication-system-variables.md#sysvar_group_replication_consistency)
system variable to set the group's level of transaction
consistency to prevent this issue. Setting this variable to
`BEFORE_ON_PRIMARY_FAILOVER` (the default) or
any higher consistency level holds new transactions on a newly
elected primary until the backlog has been applied.

For more information on transaction consistency, see
[Section 20.5.3, “Transaction Consistency Guarantees”](group-replication-consistency-guarantees.md "20.5.3 Transaction Consistency Guarantees"). If
flow control and transaction consistency guarantees are not used
for a group, it is a good practice to wait for the new primary
to apply its replication-related relay log before re-routing
client applications to it.

##### 20.1.3.1.1 Primary Election Algorithm

The automatic primary member election process involves each
member looking at the new view of the group, ordering the
potential new primary members, and choosing the member that
qualifies as the most suitable. Each member makes its own
decision locally, following the primary election algorithm in
its MySQL Server release. Because all members must reach the
same decision, members adapt their primary election algorithm
if other group members are running lower MySQL Server
versions, so that they have the same behavior as the member
with the lowest MySQL Server version in the group.

The factors considered by members when electing a primary, in
order, are as follows:

1. The first factor considered is which member or members
   are running the lowest MySQL Server version. If all
   group members are running MySQL 8.0.17 or higher,
   members are first ordered by the patch version of their
   release. If any members are running MySQL 5.7, or MySQL
   8.0.16 or earlier, members are first ordered by the
   major version of their release, and the patch version is
   ignored.
2. If more than one member is running the lowest MySQL
   Server version, the second factor considered is the
   member weight of each of those members, as specified by
   the
   [`group_replication_member_weight`](group-replication-system-variables.md#sysvar_group_replication_member_weight)
   system variable on the member. If any member of the
   group is running MySQL Server 5.7, where this system
   variable was not available, this factor is ignored.

   The
   [`group_replication_member_weight`](group-replication-system-variables.md#sysvar_group_replication_member_weight)
   system variable specifies a number in the range 0-100.
   All members default to a weight of 50, so set a weight
   below this to lower their ordering, and a weight above
   it to increase their ordering. You can use this
   weighting function to prioritize the use of better
   hardware or to ensure failover to a specific member
   during scheduled maintenance of the primary.
3. If more than one member is running the lowest MySQL
   Server version, and more than one of those members has
   the highest member weight (or member weighting is being
   ignored), the third factor considered is the
   lexicographical order of the generated server UUIDs of
   each member, as specified by the
   [`server_uuid`](replication-options.md#sysvar_server_uuid) system
   variable. The member with the lowest server UUID is
   chosen as the primary. This factor acts as a guaranteed
   and predictable tie-breaker so that all group members
   reach the same decision if it cannot be determined by
   any important factors.

##### 20.1.3.1.2 Finding the Primary

To find out which server is currently the primary when
deployed in single-primary mode, use the
`MEMBER_ROLE` column in the
[`performance_schema.replication_group_members`](performance-schema-replication-group-members-table.md "29.12.11.16 The replication_group_members Table")
table. For example:

```sql
mysql> SELECT MEMBER_HOST, MEMBER_ROLE FROM performance_schema.replication_group_members;
+-------------------------+-------------+
| MEMBER_HOST             | MEMBER_ROLE |
+-------------------------+-------------+
| remote1.example.com     | PRIMARY     |
| remote2.example.com     | SECONDARY   |
| remote3.example.com     | SECONDARY   |
+-------------------------+-------------+
```

Warning

The `group_replication_primary_member`
status variable has been deprecated; expect it to be removed
in a future version.

Alternatively use the
[`group_replication_primary_member`](group-replication-status-variables.md#statvar_group_replication_primary_member)
status variable, like this:

```sql
mysql> SHOW STATUS LIKE 'group_replication_primary_member'
```
