#### 8.4.3.1 Password Validation Component Installation and Uninstallation

This section describes how to install and uninstall the
`validate_password` password-validation
component. For general information about installing and
uninstalling components, see [Section 7.5, “MySQL Components”](components.md "7.5 MySQL Components").

Note

If you install MySQL 8.0 using the
[MySQL Yum
repository](https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/repo/yum/),
[MySQL SLES
Repository](https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/repo/suse/), or
[RPM packages provided
by Oracle](linux-installation-rpm.md "2.5.4 Installing MySQL on Linux Using RPM Packages from Oracle"), the `validate_password`
component is enabled by default after you start your MySQL
Server for the first time.

Upgrades to MySQL 8.0 from 5.7
using Yum or RPM packages leave the
`validate_password` plugin in place. To make
the transition from the `validate_password`
plugin to the `validate_password` component,
see [Section 8.4.3.3, “Transitioning to the Password Validation Component”](validate-password-transitioning.md "8.4.3.3 Transitioning to the Password Validation Component").

To be usable by the server, the component library file must be
located in the MySQL plugin directory (the directory named by
the [`plugin_dir`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_plugin_dir) system
variable). If necessary, configure the plugin directory location
by setting the value of
[`plugin_dir`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_plugin_dir) at server startup.

To install the `validate_password` component,
use this statement:

```sql
INSTALL COMPONENT 'file://component_validate_password';
```

Component installation is a one-time operation that need not be
done per server startup. [`INSTALL
COMPONENT`](install-component.md "15.7.4.3 INSTALL COMPONENT Statement") loads the component, and also registers it
in the `mysql.component` system table to cause
it to be loaded during subsequent server startups.

To uninstall the `validate_password` component,
use this statement:

```sql
UNINSTALL COMPONENT 'file://component_validate_password';
```

[`UNINSTALL COMPONENT`](uninstall-component.md "15.7.4.5 UNINSTALL COMPONENT Statement") unloads the
component, and unregisters it from the
`mysql.component` system table to cause it not
to be loaded during subsequent server startups.
