#### 29.12.7.3 The events\_transactions\_history\_long Table

The
[`events_transactions_history_long`](performance-schema-events-transactions-history-long-table.md "29.12.7.3 The events_transactions_history_long Table")
table contains the *`N`* most recent
transaction events that have ended globally, across all
threads. Transaction events are not added to the table until
they have ended. When the table becomes full, the oldest row
is discarded when a new row is added, regardless of which
thread generated either row.

The Performance Schema autosizes the value of
*`N`* is autosized at server startup.
To set the table size explicitly, set the
[`performance_schema_events_transactions_history_long_size`](performance-schema-system-variables.md#sysvar_performance_schema_events_transactions_history_long_size)
system variable at server startup.

The
[`events_transactions_history_long`](performance-schema-events-transactions-history-long-table.md "29.12.7.3 The events_transactions_history_long Table")
table has the same columns as
[`events_transactions_current`](performance-schema-events-transactions-current-table.md "29.12.7.1 The events_transactions_current Table"). See
[Section 29.12.7.1, “The events\_transactions\_current Table”](performance-schema-events-transactions-current-table.md "29.12.7.1 The events_transactions_current Table").
Unlike
[`events_transactions_current`](performance-schema-events-transactions-current-table.md "29.12.7.1 The events_transactions_current Table"),
[`events_transactions_history_long`](performance-schema-events-transactions-history-long-table.md "29.12.7.3 The events_transactions_history_long Table")
has no indexing.

[`TRUNCATE TABLE`](truncate-table.md "15.1.37 TRUNCATE TABLE Statement") is permitted for
the
[`events_transactions_history_long`](performance-schema-events-transactions-history-long-table.md "29.12.7.3 The events_transactions_history_long Table")
table. It removes the rows.

transaction event tables, see
[Section 29.9, “Performance Schema Tables for Current and Historical Events”](performance-schema-event-tables.md "29.9 Performance Schema Tables for Current and Historical Events").
