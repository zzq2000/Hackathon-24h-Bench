#### 17.8.3.6 Saving and Restoring the Buffer Pool State

To reduce the [warmup](glossary.md#glos_warm_up "warm up") period
after restarting the server, `InnoDB` saves a
percentage of the most recently used pages for each buffer pool
at server shutdown and restores these pages at server startup.
The percentage of recently used pages that is stored is defined
by the
[`innodb_buffer_pool_dump_pct`](innodb-parameters.md#sysvar_innodb_buffer_pool_dump_pct)
configuration option.

After restarting a busy server, there is typically a warmup
period with steadily increasing throughput, as disk pages that
were in the buffer pool are brought back into memory (as the
same data is queried, updated, and so on). The ability to
restore the buffer pool at startup shortens the warmup period by
reloading disk pages that were in the buffer pool before the
restart rather than waiting for DML operations to access
corresponding rows. Also, I/O requests can be performed in large
batches, making the overall I/O faster. Page loading happens in
the background, and does not delay database startup.

In addition to saving the buffer pool state at shutdown and
restoring it at startup, you can save and restore the buffer
pool state at any time, while the server is running. For
example, you can save the state of the buffer pool after
reaching a stable throughput under a steady workload. You could
also restore the previous buffer pool state after running
reports or maintenance jobs that bring data pages into the
buffer pool that are only requited for those operations, or
after running some other non-typical workload.

Even though a buffer pool can be many gigabytes in size, the
buffer pool data that `InnoDB` saves to disk is
tiny by comparison. Only tablespace IDs and page IDs necessary
to locate the appropriate pages are saved to disk. This
information is derived from the
[`INNODB_BUFFER_PAGE_LRU`](information-schema-innodb-buffer-page-lru-table.md "28.4.3 The INFORMATION_SCHEMA INNODB_BUFFER_PAGE_LRU Table")
`INFORMATION_SCHEMA` table. By default,
tablespace ID and page ID data is saved in a file named
`ib_buffer_pool`, which is saved to the
`InnoDB` data directory. The file name and
location can be modified using the
[`innodb_buffer_pool_filename`](innodb-parameters.md#sysvar_innodb_buffer_pool_filename)
configuration parameter.

Because data is cached in and aged out of the buffer pool as it
is with regular database operations, there is no problem if the
disk pages are recently updated, or if a DML operation involves
data that has not yet been loaded. The loading mechanism skips
requested pages that no longer exist.

The underlying mechanism involves a background thread that is
dispatched to perform the dump and load operations.

Disk pages from compressed tables are loaded into the buffer
pool in their compressed form. Pages are uncompressed as usual
when page contents are accessed during DML operations. Because
uncompressing pages is a CPU-intensive process, it is more
efficient for concurrency to perform the operation in a
connection thread rather than in the single thread that performs
the buffer pool restore operation.

##### Configuring the Dump Percentage for Buffer Pool Pages

Before dumping pages from the buffer pool, you can configure
the percentage of most-recently-used buffer pool pages that
you want to dump by setting the
[`innodb_buffer_pool_dump_pct`](innodb-parameters.md#sysvar_innodb_buffer_pool_dump_pct)
option. If you plan to dump buffer pool pages while the server
is running, you can configure the option dynamically:

```sql
SET GLOBAL innodb_buffer_pool_dump_pct=40;
```

If you plan to dump buffer pool pages at server shutdown, set
[`innodb_buffer_pool_dump_pct`](innodb-parameters.md#sysvar_innodb_buffer_pool_dump_pct)
in your configuration file.

```ini
[mysqld]
innodb_buffer_pool_dump_pct=40
```

The
[`innodb_buffer_pool_dump_pct`](innodb-parameters.md#sysvar_innodb_buffer_pool_dump_pct)
default value is 25 (dump 25% of most-recently-used pages).

##### Saving the Buffer Pool State at Shutdown and Restoring it at Startup

To save the state of the buffer pool at server shutdown, issue
the following statement prior to shutting down the server:

```sql
SET GLOBAL innodb_buffer_pool_dump_at_shutdown=ON;
```

[`innodb_buffer_pool_dump_at_shutdown`](innodb-parameters.md#sysvar_innodb_buffer_pool_dump_at_shutdown)
is enabled by default.

To restore the buffer pool state at server startup, specify
the `--innodb-buffer-pool-load-at-startup`
option when starting the server:

```terminal
mysqld --innodb-buffer-pool-load-at-startup=ON;
```

[`innodb_buffer_pool_load_at_startup`](innodb-parameters.md#sysvar_innodb_buffer_pool_load_at_startup)
is enabled by default.

##### Saving and Restoring the Buffer Pool State Online

To save the state of the buffer pool while MySQL server is
running, issue the following statement:

```sql
SET GLOBAL innodb_buffer_pool_dump_now=ON;
```

To restore the buffer pool state while MySQL is running, issue
the following statement:

```sql
SET GLOBAL innodb_buffer_pool_load_now=ON;
```

##### Displaying Buffer Pool Dump Progress

To display progress when saving the buffer pool state to disk,
issue the following statement:

```sql
SHOW STATUS LIKE 'Innodb_buffer_pool_dump_status';
```

If the operation has not yet started, “not
started” is returned. If the operation is complete, the
completion time is printed (e.g. Finished at 110505 12:18:02).
If the operation is in progress, status information is
provided (e.g. Dumping buffer pool 5/7, page 237/2873).

##### Displaying Buffer Pool Load Progress

To display progress when loading the buffer pool, issue the
following statement:

```sql
SHOW STATUS LIKE 'Innodb_buffer_pool_load_status';
```

If the operation has not yet started, “not
started” is returned. If the operation is complete, the
completion time is printed (e.g. Finished at 110505 12:23:24).
If the operation is in progress, status information is
provided (e.g. Loaded 123/22301 pages).

##### Aborting a Buffer Pool Load Operation

To abort a buffer pool load operation, issue the following
statement:

```sql
SET GLOBAL innodb_buffer_pool_load_abort=ON;
```

##### Monitoring Buffer Pool Load Progress Using Performance Schema

You can monitor buffer pool load progress using
[Performance Schema](performance-schema.md "Chapter 29 MySQL Performance Schema").

The following example demonstrates how to enable the
`stage/innodb/buffer pool load` stage event
instrument and related consumer tables to monitor buffer pool
load progress.

For information about buffer pool dump and load procedures
used in this example, see
[Section 17.8.3.6, “Saving and Restoring the Buffer Pool State”](innodb-preload-buffer-pool.md "17.8.3.6 Saving and Restoring the Buffer Pool State"). For information
about Performance Schema stage event instruments and related
consumers, see
[Section 29.12.5, “Performance Schema Stage Event Tables”](performance-schema-stage-tables.md "29.12.5 Performance Schema Stage Event Tables").

1. Enable the `stage/innodb/buffer pool
   load` instrument:

   ```sql
   mysql> UPDATE performance_schema.setup_instruments SET ENABLED = 'YES'
          WHERE NAME LIKE 'stage/innodb/buffer%';
   ```
2. Enable the stage event consumer tables, which include
   [`events_stages_current`](performance-schema-events-stages-current-table.md "29.12.5.1 The events_stages_current Table"),
   [`events_stages_history`](performance-schema-events-stages-history-table.md "29.12.5.2 The events_stages_history Table"), and
   [`events_stages_history_long`](performance-schema-events-stages-history-long-table.md "29.12.5.3 The events_stages_history_long Table").

   ```sql
   mysql> UPDATE performance_schema.setup_consumers SET ENABLED = 'YES'
          WHERE NAME LIKE '%stages%';
   ```
3. Dump the current buffer pool state by enabling
   [`innodb_buffer_pool_dump_now`](innodb-parameters.md#sysvar_innodb_buffer_pool_dump_now).

   ```sql
   mysql> SET GLOBAL innodb_buffer_pool_dump_now=ON;
   ```
4. Check the buffer pool dump status to ensure that the
   operation has completed.

   ```sql
   mysql> SHOW STATUS LIKE 'Innodb_buffer_pool_dump_status'\G
   *************************** 1. row ***************************
   Variable_name: Innodb_buffer_pool_dump_status
           Value: Buffer pool(s) dump completed at 150202 16:38:58
   ```
5. Load the buffer pool by enabling
   [`innodb_buffer_pool_load_now`](innodb-parameters.md#sysvar_innodb_buffer_pool_load_now):

   ```sql
   mysql> SET GLOBAL innodb_buffer_pool_load_now=ON;
   ```
6. Check the current status of the buffer pool load operation
   by querying the Performance Schema
   [`events_stages_current`](performance-schema-events-stages-current-table.md "29.12.5.1 The events_stages_current Table") table.
   The `WORK_COMPLETED` column shows the
   number of buffer pool pages loaded. The
   `WORK_ESTIMATED` column provides an
   estimate of the remaining work, in pages.

   ```sql
   mysql> SELECT EVENT_NAME, WORK_COMPLETED, WORK_ESTIMATED
          FROM performance_schema.events_stages_current;
   +-------------------------------+----------------+----------------+
   | EVENT_NAME                    | WORK_COMPLETED | WORK_ESTIMATED |
   +-------------------------------+----------------+----------------+
   | stage/innodb/buffer pool load |           5353 |           7167 |
   +-------------------------------+----------------+----------------+
   ```

   The [`events_stages_current`](performance-schema-events-stages-current-table.md "29.12.5.1 The events_stages_current Table")
   table returns an empty set if the buffer pool load
   operation has completed. In this case, you can check the
   [`events_stages_history`](performance-schema-events-stages-history-table.md "29.12.5.2 The events_stages_history Table") table
   to view data for the completed event. For example:

   ```sql
   mysql> SELECT EVENT_NAME, WORK_COMPLETED, WORK_ESTIMATED
          FROM performance_schema.events_stages_history;
   +-------------------------------+----------------+----------------+
   | EVENT_NAME                    | WORK_COMPLETED | WORK_ESTIMATED |
   +-------------------------------+----------------+----------------+
   | stage/innodb/buffer pool load |           7167 |           7167 |
   +-------------------------------+----------------+----------------+
   ```

Note

You can also monitor buffer pool load progress using
Performance Schema when loading the buffer pool at startup
using
[`innodb_buffer_pool_load_at_startup`](innodb-parameters.md#sysvar_innodb_buffer_pool_load_at_startup).
In this case, the `stage/innodb/buffer pool
load` instrument and related consumers must be
enabled at startup. For more information, see
[Section 29.3, “Performance Schema Startup Configuration”](performance-schema-startup-configuration.md "29.3 Performance Schema Startup Configuration").
