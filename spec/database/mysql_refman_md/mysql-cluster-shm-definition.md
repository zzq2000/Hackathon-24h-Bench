#### 25.4.3.12 NDB Cluster Shared-Memory Connections

Communications between NDB cluster nodes are normally handled
using TCP/IP. The shared memory (SHM) transporter is
distinguished by the fact that signals are transmitted by
writing in memory rather than on a socket. The shared-memory
transporter (SHM) can improve performance by negating up to 20%
of the overhead required by a TCP connection when running an API
node (usually an SQL node) and a data node together on the same
host. You can enable a shared memory connection in either of the
two ways listed here:

- By setting the
  [`UseShm`](mysql-cluster-ndbd-definition.md#ndbparam-ndbd-useshm) data node
  configuration parameter to `1`, and setting
  [`HostName`](mysql-cluster-ndbd-definition.md#ndbparam-ndbd-hostname) for the
  data node and
  [`HostName`](mysql-cluster-api-definition.md#ndbparam-api-hostname) for the API
  node to the same value.
- By using `[shm]` sections in the cluster
  configuration file, each containing settings for
  [`NodeId1`](mysql-cluster-shm-definition.md#ndbparam-shm-nodeid1) and
  [`NodeId2`](mysql-cluster-shm-definition.md#ndbparam-shm-nodeid2). This method
  is described in more detail later in this section.

Suppose a cluster is running a data node which has node ID 1 and
an SQL node having node ID 51 on the same host computer at
10.0.0.1. To enable an SHM connection between these two nodes,
all that is necessary is to insure that the following entries
are included in the cluster configuration file:

```ini
[ndbd]
NodeId=1
HostName=10.0.0.1
UseShm=1

[mysqld]
NodeId=51
HostName=10.0.0.1
```

Important

The two entries just shown are in addition to any other
entries and parameter settings needed by the cluster. A more
complete example is shown later in this section.

Before starting data nodes that use SHM connections, it is also
necessary to make sure that the operating system on each
computer hosting such a data node has sufficient memory
allocated to shared memory segments. See the documentation for
your operating platform for information regarding this. In
setups where multiple hosts are each running a data node and an
API node, it is possible to enable shared memory on all such
hosts by setting `UseShm` in the `[ndbd
default]` section of the configuration file. This is
shown in the example later in this section.

While not strictly required, tuning for all SHM connections in
the cluster can be done by setting one or more of the following
parameters in the `[shm default]` section of
the cluster configuration (`config.ini`)
file:

- [`ShmSize`](mysql-cluster-shm-definition.md#ndbparam-shm-shmsize): Shared
  memory size
- [`ShmSpinTime`](mysql-cluster-shm-definition.md#ndbparam-shm-shmspintime): Time in
  µs to spin before sleeping
- [`SendBufferMemory`](mysql-cluster-shm-definition.md#ndbparam-shm-sendbuffermemory):
  Size of buffer for signals sent from this node, in bytes.
- [`SendSignalId`](mysql-cluster-shm-definition.md#ndbparam-shm-sendsignalid):
  Indicates that a signal ID is included in each signal sent
  through the transporter.
- [`Checksum`](mysql-cluster-shm-definition.md#ndbparam-shm-checksum): Indicates
  that a checksum is included in each signal sent through the
  transporter.
- [`PreSendChecksum`](mysql-cluster-shm-definition.md#ndbparam-shm-presendchecksum):
  Checks of the checksum are made prior to sending the signal;
  Checksum must also be enabled for this to work

This example shows a simple setup with SHM connections defined
on multiple hosts, in an NDB Cluster using 3 computers listed
here by host name, hosting the node types shown:

1. `10.0.0.0`: The management server
2. `10.0.0.1`: A data node and an SQL node
3. `10.0.0.2`: A data node and an SQL node

In this scenario, each data node communicates with both the
management server and the other data node using TCP
transporters; each SQL node uses a shared memory transporter to
communicate with the data nodes that is local to it, and a TCP
transporter to communicate with the remote data node. A basic
configuration reflecting this setup is enabled by the config.ini
file whose contents are shown here:

```ini
[ndbd default]
DataDir=/path/to/datadir
UseShm=1

[shm default]
ShmSize=8M
ShmSpintime=200
SendBufferMemory=4M

[tcp default]
SendBufferMemory=8M

[ndb_mgmd]
NodeId=49
Hostname=10.0.0.0
DataDir=/path/to/datadir

[ndbd]
NodeId=1
Hostname=10.0.0.1
DataDir=/path/to/datadir

[ndbd]
NodeId=2
Hostname=10.0.0.2
DataDir=/path/to/datadir

[mysqld]
NodeId=51
Hostname=10.0.0.1

[mysqld]
NodeId=52
Hostname=10.0.0.2

[api]
[api]
```

Parameters affecting all shared memory transporters are set in
the `[shm default]` section; these can be
overridden on a per-connection basis in one or more
`[shm]` sections. Each such section must be
associated with a given SHM connection using
[`NodeId1`](mysql-cluster-shm-definition.md#ndbparam-shm-nodeid1) and
[`NodeId2`](mysql-cluster-shm-definition.md#ndbparam-shm-nodeid2); the values
required for these parameters are the node IDs of the two nodes
connected by the transporter. You can also identify the nodes by
host name using [`HostName1`](mysql-cluster-shm-definition.md#ndbparam-shm-hostname1)
and [`HostName2`](mysql-cluster-shm-definition.md#ndbparam-shm-hostname2), but these
parameters are not required.

The API nodes for which no host names are set use the TCP
transporter to communicate with data nodes independent of the
hosts on which they are started; the parameters and values set
in the `[tcp default]` section of the
configuration file apply to all TCP transporters in the cluster.

For optimum performance, you can define a spin time for the SHM
transporter ([`ShmSpinTime`](mysql-cluster-shm-definition.md#ndbparam-shm-shmspintime)
parameter); this affects both the data node receiver thread and
the poll owner (receive thread or user thread) in
`NDB`.

- `Checksum`

  |  |  |
  | --- | --- |
  | Version (or later) | NDB 8.0.13 |
  | Type or units | boolean |
  | Default | true |

  | Restart Type | **Node Restart:**Requires a [rolling restart](mysql-cluster-rolling-restart.md "25.6.5 Performing a Rolling Restart of an NDB Cluster") of the cluster. (NDB 8.0.13) |

  This parameter is a boolean
  (`Y`/`N`) parameter which
  is disabled by default. When it is enabled, checksums for
  all messages are calculated before being placed in the send
  buffer.

  This feature prevents messages from being corrupted while
  waiting in the send buffer. It also serves as a check
  against data being corrupted during transport.

  The `HostName1` and
  [`HostName2`](mysql-cluster-shm-definition.md#ndbparam-shm-hostname2) parameters
  can be used to specify specific network interfaces to be
  used for a given SHM connection between two nodes. The
  values used for these parameters can be host names or IP
  addresses.

  When more than this many unsent bytes are in the send
  buffer, the connection is considered overloaded. See
  [Section 25.4.3.14, “Configuring NDB Cluster Send Buffer Parameters”](mysql-cluster-config-send-buffers.md "25.4.3.14 Configuring NDB Cluster Send Buffer Parameters"), and
  [Section 25.6.16.65, “The ndbinfo transporters Table”](mysql-cluster-ndbinfo-transporters.md "25.6.16.65 The ndbinfo transporters Table"), for
  more information.

  If this parameter and
  [`Checksum`](mysql-cluster-shm-definition.md#ndbparam-shm-checksum) are both
  enabled, perform pre-send checksum checks, and check all SHM
  signals between nodes for errors. Has no effect if
  `Checksum` is not also enabled.

  To retrace the path of a distributed message, it is
  necessary to provide each message with a unique identifier.
  Setting this parameter to `Y` causes these
  message IDs to be transported over the network as well. This
  feature is disabled by default in production builds, and
  enabled in `-debug` builds.
- [`ShmKey`](mysql-cluster-shm-definition.md#ndbparam-shm-shmkey)

  When setting up shared memory segments, a node ID, expressed
  as an integer, is used to identify uniquely the shared
  memory segment to use for the communication. There is no
  default value. If
  [`UseShm`](mysql-cluster-ndbd-definition.md#ndbparam-ndbd-useshm) is enabled,
  the shared memory key is calculated automatically by
  `NDB`.

  Each SHM connection has a shared memory segment where
  messages between nodes are placed by the sender and read by
  the reader. The size of this segment is defined by
  [`ShmSize`](mysql-cluster-shm-definition.md#ndbparam-shm-shmsize). The default
  value is 4MB.

  This parameter was used formerly to override operating
  system signal numbers; in NDB 8.0, it is no longer used, and
  any setting for it is ignored.

**Restart types.**
Information about the restart types used by the parameter
descriptions in this section is shown in the following table:

**Table 25.22 NDB Cluster restart types**
