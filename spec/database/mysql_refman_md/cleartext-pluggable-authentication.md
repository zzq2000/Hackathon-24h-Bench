#### 8.4.1.4 Client-Side Cleartext Pluggable Authentication

A client-side authentication plugin is available that enables
clients to send passwords to the server as cleartext, without
hashing or encryption. This plugin is built into the MySQL
client library.

The following table shows the plugin name.

**Table 8.19 Plugin and Library Names for Cleartext Authentication**

| Plugin or File | Plugin or File Name |
| --- | --- |
| Server-side plugin | None, see discussion |
| Client-side plugin | `mysql_clear_password` |
| Library file | None (plugin is built in) |

Many client-side authentication plugins perform hashing or
encryption of a password before the client sends it to the
server. This enables clients to avoid sending passwords as
cleartext.

Hashing or encryption cannot be done for authentication schemes
that require the server to receive the password as entered on
the client side. In such cases, the client-side
`mysql_clear_password` plugin is used, which
enables the client to send the password to the server as
cleartext. There is no corresponding server-side plugin. Rather,
`mysql_clear_password` can be used on the
client side in concert with any server-side plugin that needs a
cleartext password. (Examples are the PAM and simple LDAP
authentication plugins; see
[Section 8.4.1.5, “PAM Pluggable Authentication”](pam-pluggable-authentication.md "8.4.1.5 PAM Pluggable Authentication"), and
[Section 8.4.1.7, “LDAP Pluggable Authentication”](ldap-pluggable-authentication.md "8.4.1.7 LDAP Pluggable Authentication").)

The following discussion provides usage information specific to
cleartext pluggable authentication. For general information
about pluggable authentication in MySQL, see
[Section 8.2.17, “Pluggable Authentication”](pluggable-authentication.md "8.2.17 Pluggable Authentication").

Note

Sending passwords as cleartext may be a security problem in
some configurations. To avoid problems if there is any
possibility that the password would be intercepted, clients
should connect to MySQL Server using a method that protects
the password. Possibilities include SSL (see
[Section 8.3, “Using Encrypted Connections”](encrypted-connections.md "8.3 Using Encrypted Connections")), IPsec, or a private
network.

To make inadvertent use of the
`mysql_clear_password` plugin less likely,
MySQL clients must explicitly enable it. This can be done in
several ways:

- Set the `LIBMYSQL_ENABLE_CLEARTEXT_PLUGIN`
  environment variable to a value that begins with
  `1`, `Y`, or
  `y`. This enables the plugin for all client
  connections.
- The [**mysql**](mysql.md "6.5.1 mysql — The MySQL Command-Line Client"), [**mysqladmin**](mysqladmin.md "6.5.2 mysqladmin — A MySQL Server Administration Program"),
  [**mysqlcheck**](mysqlcheck.md "6.5.3 mysqlcheck — A Table Maintenance Program"), [**mysqldump**](mysqldump.md "6.5.4 mysqldump — A Database Backup Program"),
  [**mysqlshow**](mysqlshow.md "6.5.7 mysqlshow — Display Database, Table, and Column Information"), and
  [**mysqlslap**](mysqlslap.md "6.5.8 mysqlslap — A Load Emulation Client") client programs support an
  `--enable-cleartext-plugin` option that
  enables the plugin on a per-invocation basis.
- The [`mysql_options()`](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/c-api/8.0/en/mysql-options.html) C API
  function supports a
  `MYSQL_ENABLE_CLEARTEXT_PLUGIN` option that
  enables the plugin on a per-connection basis. Also, any
  program that uses `libmysqlclient` and
  reads option files can enable the plugin by including an
  `enable-cleartext-plugin` option in an
  option group read by the client library.
