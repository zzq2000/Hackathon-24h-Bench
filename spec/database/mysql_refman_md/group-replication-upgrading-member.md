#### 20.8.3.2 Upgrading a Group Replication Member

This section explains the steps required for upgrading a member
of a group. This procedure is part of the methods described at
[Section 20.8.3.3, “Group Replication Online Upgrade Methods”](group-replication-online-upgrade-methods.md "20.8.3.3 Group Replication Online Upgrade Methods"). The
process of upgrading a member of a group is common to all
methods and is explained first. The way which you join upgraded
members can depend on which method you are following, and other
factors such as whether the group is operating in single-primary
or multi-primary mode. How you upgrade the server instance,
using either the in-place or provision approach, does not impact
on the methods described here.

The process of upgrading a member consists of removing it from
the group, following your chosen method of upgrading the member,
and then rejoining the upgraded member to a group. The
recommended order of upgrading members in a single-primary group
is to upgrade all secondaries, and then upgrade the primary
last. If the primary is upgraded before a secondary, a new
primary using the older MySQL version is chosen, but there is no
need for this step.

To upgrade a member of a group:

- Connect a client to the group member and issue
  [`STOP GROUP_REPLICATION`](stop-group-replication.md "15.4.3.2 STOP GROUP_REPLICATION Statement").
  Before proceeding, ensure that the member's status is
  `OFFLINE` by monitoring the
  [`replication_group_members`](performance-schema-replication-group-members-table.md "29.12.11.16 The replication_group_members Table")
  table.
- Disable Group Replication from starting up automatically so
  that you can safely connect to the member after upgrading
  and configure it without it rejoining the group by setting
  [`group_replication_start_on_boot=0`](group-replication-system-variables.md#sysvar_group_replication_start_on_boot).

  Important

  If an upgraded member has [`group_replication_start_on_boot=1`](group-replication-system-variables.md#sysvar_group_replication_start_on_boot) then it could
  rejoin the group before you can perform the MySQL upgrade
  procedure and could result in issues. For example, if the
  upgrade fails and the server restarts again, then a
  possibly broken server could try to join the group.
- Stop the member, for example using [**mysqladmin
  shutdown**](mysqladmin.md "6.5.2 mysqladmin — A MySQL Server Administration Program") or the
  [`SHUTDOWN`](shutdown.md "15.7.8.9 SHUTDOWN Statement") statement. Any other
  members in the group continue running.
- Upgrade the member, using the in-place or provisioning
  approach. See [Chapter 3, *Upgrading MySQL*](upgrading.md "Chapter 3 Upgrading MySQL") for details. When
  restarting the upgraded member, because
  [`group_replication_start_on_boot`](group-replication-system-variables.md#sysvar_group_replication_start_on_boot) is set to 0, Group
  Replication does not start on the instance, and therefore it
  does not rejoin the group.
- Once the MySQL upgrade procedure has been performed on the
  member,
  [`group_replication_start_on_boot`](group-replication-system-variables.md#sysvar_group_replication_start_on_boot)
  must be set to 1 to ensure Group Replication starts
  correctly after restart. Restart the member.
- Connect to the upgraded member and issue
  [`START GROUP_REPLICATION`](start-group-replication.md "15.4.3.1 START GROUP_REPLICATION Statement"). This
  rejoins the member to the group. The Group Replication
  metadata is in place on the upgraded server, therefore there
  is usually no need to reconfigure Group Replication. The
  server has to catch up with any transactions processed by
  the group while the server was offline. Once it has caught
  up with the group, it becomes an online member of the group.

  Note

  The longer it takes to upgrade a server, the more time
  that member is offline and therefore the more time it
  takes for the server to catch up when added back to the
  group.

When an upgraded member joins a group which has any member
running an earlier MySQL Server version, the upgraded member
joins with [`super_read_only=on`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_super_read_only).
This ensures that no writes are made to upgraded members until
all members are running the newer version. In a multi-primary
mode group, when the upgrade has been completed successfully and
the group is ready to process transactions, members that are
intended as writeable primaries must be set to read-write mode.
As of MySQL 8.0.17, when all members of a group have been
upgraded to the same release, they all change back to read-write
mode automatically. For earlier releases you must set each
member manually to read-write mode. Connect to each member and
issue:

```sql
SET GLOBAL super_read_only=OFF;
```
