#### 19.5.1.16 Replication of Invoked Features

Replication of invoked features such as loadable functions and
stored programs (stored procedures and functions, triggers, and
events) provides the following characteristics:

- The effects of the feature are always replicated.
- The following statements are replicated using
  statement-based replication:

  - [`CREATE EVENT`](create-event.md "15.1.13 CREATE EVENT Statement")
  - [`ALTER EVENT`](alter-event.md "15.1.3 ALTER EVENT Statement")
  - [`DROP EVENT`](drop-event.md "15.1.25 DROP EVENT Statement")
  - [`CREATE PROCEDURE`](create-procedure.md "15.1.17 CREATE PROCEDURE and CREATE FUNCTION Statements")
  - [`DROP PROCEDURE`](drop-procedure.md "15.1.29 DROP PROCEDURE and DROP FUNCTION Statements")
  - [`CREATE FUNCTION`](create-function.md "15.1.14 CREATE FUNCTION Statement")
  - [`DROP FUNCTION`](drop-function.md "15.1.26 DROP FUNCTION Statement")
  - [`CREATE TRIGGER`](create-trigger.md "15.1.22 CREATE TRIGGER Statement")
  - [`DROP TRIGGER`](drop-trigger.md "15.1.34 DROP TRIGGER Statement")

  However, the *effects* of features
  created, modified, or dropped using these statements are
  replicated using row-based replication.

  Note

  Attempting to replicate invoked features using
  statement-based replication produces the warning
  Statement is not safe to log in statement
  format. For example, trying to replicate a
  loadable function with statement-based replication
  generates this warning because it currently cannot be
  determined by the MySQL server whether the function is
  deterministic. If you are absolutely certain that the
  invoked feature's effects are deterministic, you can
  safely disregard such warnings.
- In the case of [`CREATE EVENT`](create-event.md "15.1.13 CREATE EVENT Statement")
  and [`ALTER EVENT`](alter-event.md "15.1.3 ALTER EVENT Statement"):

  - The status of the event is set to
    `SLAVESIDE_DISABLED` on the replica
    regardless of the state specified (this does not apply
    to [`DROP EVENT`](drop-event.md "15.1.25 DROP EVENT Statement")).
  - The source on which the event was created is identified
    on the replica by its server ID. The
    `ORIGINATOR` column in
    [`INFORMATION_SCHEMA.EVENTS`](information-schema-events-table.md "28.3.14 The INFORMATION_SCHEMA EVENTS Table")
    stores this information. See
    [Section 15.7.7.18, “SHOW EVENTS Statement”](show-events.md "15.7.7.18 SHOW EVENTS Statement"), for more information.
- The feature implementation resides on the replica in a
  renewable state so that if the source fails, the replica can
  be used as the source without loss of event processing.

To determine whether there are any scheduled events on a MySQL
server that were created on a different server (that was acting
as a source), query the Information Schema
[`EVENTS`](information-schema-events-table.md "28.3.14 The INFORMATION_SCHEMA EVENTS Table") table in a manner similar to
what is shown here:

```sql
SELECT EVENT_SCHEMA, EVENT_NAME
    FROM INFORMATION_SCHEMA.EVENTS
    WHERE STATUS = 'SLAVESIDE_DISABLED';
```

Alternatively, you can use the [`SHOW
EVENTS`](show-events.md "15.7.7.18 SHOW EVENTS Statement") statement, like this:

```sql
SHOW EVENTS
    WHERE STATUS = 'SLAVESIDE_DISABLED';
```

When promoting a replica having such events to a source, you
must enable each event using
[`ALTER EVENT
event_name ENABLE`](alter-event.md "15.1.3 ALTER EVENT Statement"), where
*`event_name`* is the name of the event.

If more than one source was involved in creating events on this
replica, and you wish to identify events that were created only
on a given source having the server ID
*`source_id`*, modify the previous query
on the [`EVENTS`](information-schema-events-table.md "28.3.14 The INFORMATION_SCHEMA EVENTS Table") table to include the
`ORIGINATOR` column, as shown here:

```sql
SELECT EVENT_SCHEMA, EVENT_NAME, ORIGINATOR
    FROM INFORMATION_SCHEMA.EVENTS
    WHERE STATUS = 'SLAVESIDE_DISABLED'
    AND   ORIGINATOR = 'source_id'
```

You can employ `ORIGINATOR` with the
[`SHOW EVENTS`](show-events.md "15.7.7.18 SHOW EVENTS Statement") statement in a
similar fashion:

```sql
SHOW EVENTS
    WHERE STATUS = 'SLAVESIDE_DISABLED'
    AND   ORIGINATOR = 'source_id'
```

Before enabling events that were replicated from the source, you
should disable the MySQL Event Scheduler on the replica (using a
statement such as `SET GLOBAL event_scheduler =
OFF;`), run any necessary [`ALTER
EVENT`](alter-event.md "15.1.3 ALTER EVENT Statement") statements, restart the server, then re-enable
the Event Scheduler on the replica afterward (using a statement
such as `SET GLOBAL event_scheduler = ON;`)-

If you later demote the new source back to being a replica, you
must disable manually all events enabled by the
[`ALTER EVENT`](alter-event.md "15.1.3 ALTER EVENT Statement") statements. You can
do this by storing in a separate table the event names from the
[`SELECT`](select.md "15.2.13 SELECT Statement") statement shown
previously, or using [`ALTER EVENT`](alter-event.md "15.1.3 ALTER EVENT Statement")
statements to rename the events with a common prefix such as
`replicated_` to identify them.

If you rename the events, then when demoting this server back to
being a replica, you can identify the events by querying the
[`EVENTS`](information-schema-events-table.md "28.3.14 The INFORMATION_SCHEMA EVENTS Table") table, as shown here:

```sql
SELECT CONCAT(EVENT_SCHEMA, '.', EVENT_NAME) AS 'Db.Event'
      FROM INFORMATION_SCHEMA.EVENTS
      WHERE INSTR(EVENT_NAME, 'replicated_') = 1;
```
