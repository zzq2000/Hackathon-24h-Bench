### 10.5.7 Optimizing InnoDB DDL Operations

- Many DDL operations on tables and indexes
  (`CREATE`, `ALTER`, and
  `DROP` statements) can be performed online.
  See [Section 17.12, “InnoDB and Online DDL”](innodb-online-ddl.md "17.12 InnoDB and Online DDL") for details.
- Online DDL support for adding secondary indexes means that
  you can generally speed up the process of creating and
  loading a table and associated indexes by creating the table
  without secondary indexes, then adding secondary indexes
  after the data is loaded.
- Use [`TRUNCATE TABLE`](truncate-table.md "15.1.37 TRUNCATE TABLE Statement") to empty a
  table, not `DELETE FROM
  tbl_name`. Foreign key
  constraints can make a `TRUNCATE` statement
  work like a regular `DELETE` statement, in
  which case a sequence of commands like
  [`DROP TABLE`](drop-table.md "15.1.32 DROP TABLE Statement") and
  [`CREATE TABLE`](create-table.md "15.1.20 CREATE TABLE Statement") might be
  fastest.
- Because the primary key is integral to the storage layout of
  each `InnoDB` table, and changing the
  definition of the primary key involves reorganizing the
  whole table, always set up the primary key as part of the
  [`CREATE TABLE`](create-table.md "15.1.20 CREATE TABLE Statement") statement, and
  plan ahead so that you do not need to
  `ALTER` or `DROP` the
  primary key afterward.
