#### 25.4.2.2 NDB Cluster Management Node Configuration Parameters

The listing in this section provides information about
parameters used in the `[ndb_mgmd]` or
`[mgm]` section of a
`config.ini` file for configuring NDB Cluster
management nodes. For detailed descriptions and other additional
information about each of these parameters, see
[Section 25.4.3.5, “Defining an NDB Cluster Management Server”](mysql-cluster-mgm-definition.md "25.4.3.5 Defining an NDB Cluster Management Server").

- `ArbitrationDelay`:
  When asked to arbitrate, arbitrator waits this long before
  voting (milliseconds).
- `ArbitrationRank`:
  If 0, then management node is not arbitrator. Kernel selects
  arbitrators in order 1, 2.
- `DataDir`:
  Data directory for this node.
- `ExecuteOnComputer`:
  String referencing earlier defined COMPUTER.
- `ExtraSendBufferMemory`:
  Memory to use for send buffers in addition to any allocated
  by TotalSendBufferMemory or SendBufferMemory. Default (0)
  allows up to 16MB.
- `HeartbeatIntervalMgmdMgmd`:
  Time between management-node-to-management-node heartbeats;
  connection between management nodes is considered lost after
  3 missed heartbeats.
- `HeartbeatThreadPriority`:
  Set heartbeat thread policy and priority for management
  nodes; see manual for allowed values.
- `HostName`:
  Host name or IP address for this management node.
- `Id`:
  Number identifying management node. Now deprecated; use
  NodeId instead.
- `LocationDomainId`:
  Assign this management node to specific availability domain
  or zone. 0 (default) leaves this unset.
- `LogDestination`:
  Where to send log messages: console, system log, or
  specified log file.
- `NodeId`:
  Number uniquely identifying management node among all nodes
  in cluster.
- `PortNumber`:
  Port number to send commands to and fetch configuration from
  management server.
- `PortNumberStats`:
  Port number used to get statistical information from
  management server.
- `TotalSendBufferMemory`:
  Total memory to use for all transporter send buffers.
- `wan`:
  Use WAN TCP setting as default.

Note

After making changes in a management node's
configuration, it is necessary to perform a rolling restart of
the cluster for the new configuration to take effect. See
[Section 25.4.3.5, “Defining an NDB Cluster Management Server”](mysql-cluster-mgm-definition.md "25.4.3.5 Defining an NDB Cluster Management Server"), for more
information.

To add new management servers to a running NDB Cluster, it is
also necessary perform a rolling restart of all cluster nodes
after modifying any existing `config.ini`
files. For more information about issues arising when using
multiple management nodes, see
[Section 25.2.7.10, “Limitations Relating to Multiple NDB Cluster Nodes”](mysql-cluster-limitations-multiple-nodes.md "25.2.7.10 Limitations Relating to Multiple NDB Cluster Nodes").
