#### B.3.3.2 How to Reset the Root Password

If you have never assigned a `root` password
for MySQL, the server does not require a password at all for
connecting as `root`. However, this is
insecure. For instructions on assigning a password, see
[Section 2.9.4, “Securing the Initial MySQL Account”](default-privileges.md "2.9.4 Securing the Initial MySQL Account").

If you know the `root` password and want to
change it, see [Section 15.7.1.1, “ALTER USER Statement”](alter-user.md "15.7.1.1 ALTER USER Statement"), and
[Section 15.7.1.10, “SET PASSWORD Statement”](set-password.md "15.7.1.10 SET PASSWORD Statement").

If you assigned a `root` password previously
but have forgotten it, you can assign a new password. The
following sections provide instructions for Windows and Unix
and Unix-like systems, as well as generic instructions that
apply to any system.

##### B.3.3.2.1 Resetting the Root Password: Windows Systems

On Windows, use the following procedure to reset the
password for the MySQL `'root'@'localhost'`
account. To change the password for a
`root` account with a different host name
part, modify the instructions to use that host name.

1. Log on to your system as Administrator.
2. Stop the MySQL server if it is running. For a server
   that is running as a Windows service, go to the Services
   manager: From the Start menu, select
   Control Panel, then
   Administrative Tools, then
   Services. Find the MySQL
   service in the list and stop it.

   If your server is not running as a service, you may need
   to use the Task Manager to force it to stop.
3. Create a text file containing the password-assignment
   statement on a single line. Replace the password with
   the password that you want to use.

   ```sql
   ALTER USER 'root'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'MyNewPass';
   ```
4. Save the file. This example assumes that you name the
   file `C:\mysql-init.txt`.
5. Open a console window to get to the command prompt: From
   the Start menu, select
   Run, then enter
   **cmd** as the command to be run.
6. Start the MySQL server with the
   [`init_file`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_init_file) system
   variable set to name the file (notice that the backslash
   in the option value is doubled):

   ```terminal
   C:\> cd "C:\Program Files\MySQL\MySQL Server 8.0\bin"
   C:\> mysqld --init-file=C:\\mysql-init.txt
   ```

   If you installed MySQL to a different location, adjust
   the **cd** command accordingly.

   The server executes the contents of the file named by
   the [`init_file`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_init_file) system
   variable at startup, changing the
   `'root'@'localhost'` account password.

   To have server output to appear in the console window
   rather than in a log file, add the
   [`--console`](server-options.md#option_mysqld_console) option to the
   [**mysqld**](mysqld.md "6.3.1 mysqld — The MySQL Server") command.

   If you installed MySQL using the MySQL Installation
   Wizard, you may need to specify a
   [`--defaults-file`](option-file-options.md#option_general_defaults-file) option.
   For example:

   ```terminal
   C:\> mysqld
            --defaults-file="C:\\ProgramData\\MySQL\\MySQL Server 8.0\\my.ini"
            --init-file=C:\\mysql-init.txt
   ```

   The appropriate
   [`--defaults-file`](option-file-options.md#option_general_defaults-file) setting
   can be found using the Services Manager: From the
   Start menu, select
   Control Panel, then
   Administrative Tools, then
   Services. Find the MySQL
   service in the list, right-click it, and choose the
   `Properties` option. The `Path
   to executable` field contains the
   [`--defaults-file`](option-file-options.md#option_general_defaults-file) setting.
7. After the server has started successfully, delete
   `C:\mysql-init.txt`.

You should now be able to connect to the MySQL server as
`root` using the new password. Stop the
MySQL server and restart it normally. If you run the server
as a service, start it from the Windows Services window. If
you start the server manually, use whatever command you
normally use.

##### B.3.3.2.2 Resetting the Root Password: Unix and Unix-Like Systems

On Unix, use the following procedure to reset the password
for the MySQL `'root'@'localhost'` account.
To change the password for a `root` account
with a different host name part, modify the instructions to
use that host name.

The instructions assume that you start the MySQL server from
the Unix login account that you normally use for running it.
For example, if you run the server using the
`mysql` login account, you should log in as
`mysql` before using the instructions.
Alternatively, you can log in as `root`,
but in this case you *must* start
[**mysqld**](mysqld.md "6.3.1 mysqld — The MySQL Server") with the
[`--user=mysql`](server-options.md#option_mysqld_user) option. If you
start the server as `root` without using
[`--user=mysql`](server-options.md#option_mysqld_user), the server may
create `root`-owned files in the data
directory, such as log files, and these may cause
permission-related problems for future server startups. If
that happens, you must either change the ownership of the
files to `mysql` or remove them.

1. Log on to your system as the Unix user that the MySQL
   server runs as (for example, `mysql`).
2. Stop the MySQL server if it is running. Locate the
   `.pid` file that contains the
   server's process ID. The exact location and name of this
   file depend on your distribution, host name, and
   configuration. Common locations are
   `/var/lib/mysql/`,
   `/var/run/mysqld/`, and
   `/usr/local/mysql/data/`. Generally,
   the file name has an extension of
   `.pid` and begins with either
   `mysqld` or your system's host name.

   Stop the MySQL server by sending a normal
   `kill` (not `kill -9`)
   to the [**mysqld**](mysqld.md "6.3.1 mysqld — The MySQL Server") process. Use the actual
   path name of the `.pid` file in the
   following command:

   ```terminal
   $> kill `cat /mysql-data-directory/host_name.pid`
   ```

   Use backticks (not forward quotation marks) with the
   `cat` command. These cause the output
   of `cat` to be substituted into the
   `kill` command.
3. Create a text file containing the password-assignment
   statement on a single line. Replace the password with
   the password that you want to use.

   ```sql
   ALTER USER 'root'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'MyNewPass';
   ```
4. Save the file. This example assumes that you name the
   file `/home/me/mysql-init`. The file
   contains the password, so do not save it where it can be
   read by other users. If you are not logged in as
   `mysql` (the user the server runs as),
   make sure that the file has permissions that permit
   `mysql` to read it.
5. Start the MySQL server with the
   [`init_file`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_init_file) system
   variable set to name the file:

   ```terminal
   $> mysqld --init-file=/home/me/mysql-init &
   ```

   The server executes the contents of the file named by
   the [`init_file`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_init_file) system
   variable at startup, changing the
   `'root'@'localhost'` account password.

   Other options may be necessary as well, depending on how
   you normally start your server. For example,
   [`--defaults-file`](option-file-options.md#option_general_defaults-file) may be
   needed before the
   [`init_file`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_init_file) argument.
6. After the server has started successfully, delete
   `/home/me/mysql-init`.

You should now be able to connect to the MySQL server as
`root` using the new password. Stop the
server and restart it normally.

##### B.3.3.2.3 Resetting the Root Password: Generic Instructions

The preceding sections provide password-resetting
instructions specifically for Windows and Unix and Unix-like
systems. Alternatively, on any platform, you can reset the
password using the [**mysql**](mysql.md "6.5.1 mysql — The MySQL Command-Line Client") client (but this
approach is less secure):

1. Stop the MySQL server if necessary, then restart it with
   the [`--skip-grant-tables`](server-options.md#option_mysqld_skip-grant-tables)
   option. This enables anyone to connect without a
   password and with all privileges, and disables
   account-management statements such as
   [`ALTER USER`](alter-user.md "15.7.1.1 ALTER USER Statement") and
   [`SET PASSWORD`](set-password.md "15.7.1.10 SET PASSWORD Statement"). Because
   this is insecure, if the server is started with the
   [`--skip-grant-tables`](server-options.md#option_mysqld_skip-grant-tables)
   option, it also disables remote connections by enabling
   [`skip_networking`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_skip_networking). On
   Windows platforms, this means you must also enable
   [`shared_memory`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_shared_memory) or
   [`named_pipe`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_named_pipe); otherwise
   the server cannot start.
2. Connect to the MySQL server using the
   [**mysql**](mysql.md "6.5.1 mysql — The MySQL Command-Line Client") client; no password is
   necessary because the server was started with
   [`--skip-grant-tables`](server-options.md#option_mysqld_skip-grant-tables):

   ```terminal
   $> mysql
   ```
3. In the `mysql` client, tell the server
   to reload the grant tables so that account-management
   statements work:

   ```sql
   mysql> FLUSH PRIVILEGES;
   ```

   Then change the `'root'@'localhost'`
   account password. Replace the password with the password
   that you want to use. To change the password for a
   `root` account with a different host
   name part, modify the instructions to use that host
   name.

   ```sql
   mysql> ALTER USER 'root'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'MyNewPass';
   ```

You should now be able to connect to the MySQL server as
`root` using the new password. Stop the
server and restart it normally (without the
[`--skip-grant-tables`](server-options.md#option_mysqld_skip-grant-tables) option
and without enabling the
[`skip_networking`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_skip_networking) system
variable).
