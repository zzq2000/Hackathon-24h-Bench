### 17.6.6 Undo Logs

An undo log is a collection of undo log records associated with a
single read-write transaction. An undo log record contains
information about how to undo the latest change by a transaction
to a [clustered index](glossary.md#glos_clustered_index "clustered index")
record. If another transaction needs to see the original data as
part of a consistent read operation, the unmodified data is
retrieved from undo log records. Undo logs exist within
[undo log segments](glossary.md#glos_undo_log_segment "undo log segment"),
which are contained within
[rollback segments](glossary.md#glos_rollback_segment "rollback segment").
Rollback segments reside in
[undo tablespaces](glossary.md#glos_undo_tablespace "undo tablespace") and
in the [global
temporary tablespace](glossary.md#glos_global_temporary_tablespace "global temporary tablespace").

Undo logs that reside in the global temporary tablespace are used
for transactions that modify data in user-defined temporary
tables. These undo logs are not redo-logged, as they are not
required for crash recovery. They are used only for rollback while
the server is running. This type of undo log benefits performance
by avoiding redo logging I/O.

For information about data-at-rest encryption for undo logs, see
[Undo Log Encryption](innodb-data-encryption.md#innodb-data-encryption-undo-log "Undo Log Encryption").

Each undo tablespace and the global temporary tablespace
individually support a maximum of 128 rollback segments. The
[`innodb_rollback_segments`](innodb-parameters.md#sysvar_innodb_rollback_segments) variable
defines the number of rollback segments.

The number of transactions that a rollback segment supports
depends on the number of undo slots in the rollback segment and
the number of undo logs required by each transaction. The number
of undo slots in a rollback segment differs according to
`InnoDB` page size.

| InnoDB Page Size | Number of Undo Slots in a Rollback Segment (InnoDB Page Size / 16) |
| --- | --- |
| `4096 (4KB)` | `256` |
| `8192 (8KB)` | `512` |
| `16384 (16KB)` | `1024` |
| `32768 (32KB)` | `2048` |
| `65536 (64KB)` | `4096` |

A transaction is assigned up to four undo logs, one for each of
the following operation types:

1. [`INSERT`](insert.md "15.2.7 INSERT Statement") operations on
   user-defined tables
2. [`UPDATE`](update.md "15.2.17 UPDATE Statement") and
   [`DELETE`](delete.md "15.2.2 DELETE Statement") operations on
   user-defined tables
3. [`INSERT`](insert.md "15.2.7 INSERT Statement") operations on
   user-defined temporary tables
4. [`UPDATE`](update.md "15.2.17 UPDATE Statement") and
   [`DELETE`](delete.md "15.2.2 DELETE Statement") operations on
   user-defined temporary tables

Undo logs are assigned as needed. For example, a transaction that
performs [`INSERT`](insert.md "15.2.7 INSERT Statement"),
[`UPDATE`](update.md "15.2.17 UPDATE Statement"), and
[`DELETE`](delete.md "15.2.2 DELETE Statement") operations on regular and
temporary tables requires a full assignment of four undo logs. A
transaction that performs only
[`INSERT`](insert.md "15.2.7 INSERT Statement") operations on regular tables
requires a single undo log.

A transaction that performs operations on regular tables is
assigned undo logs from an assigned undo tablespace rollback
segment. A transaction that performs operations on temporary
tables is assigned undo logs from an assigned global temporary
tablespace rollback segment.

An undo log assigned to a transaction remains attached to the
transaction for its duration. For example, an undo log assigned to
a transaction for an [`INSERT`](insert.md "15.2.7 INSERT Statement")
operation on a regular table is used for all
[`INSERT`](insert.md "15.2.7 INSERT Statement") operations on regular tables
performed by that transaction.

Given the factors described above, the following formulas can be
used to estimate the number of concurrent read-write transactions
that `InnoDB` is capable of supporting.

Note

It is possible to encounter a concurrent transaction limit error
before reaching the number of concurrent read-write transactions
that `InnoDB` is capable of supporting. This
occurs when a rollback segment assigned to a transaction runs
out of undo slots. In such cases, try rerunning the transaction.

When transactions perform operations on temporary tables, the
number of concurrent read-write transactions that
`InnoDB` is capable of supporting is
constrained by the number of rollback segments allocated to the
global temporary tablespace, which is 128 by default.

- If each transaction performs either an
  [`INSERT`](insert.md "15.2.7 INSERT Statement")
  **or** an
  [`UPDATE`](update.md "15.2.17 UPDATE Statement") or
  [`DELETE`](delete.md "15.2.2 DELETE Statement") operation, the number of
  concurrent read-write transactions that
  `InnoDB` is capable of supporting is:

  ```none
  (innodb_page_size / 16) * innodb_rollback_segments * number of undo tablespaces
  ```
- If each transaction performs an
  [`INSERT`](insert.md "15.2.7 INSERT Statement")
  **and** an
  [`UPDATE`](update.md "15.2.17 UPDATE Statement") or
  [`DELETE`](delete.md "15.2.2 DELETE Statement") operation, the number of
  concurrent read-write transactions that
  `InnoDB` is capable of supporting is:

  ```none
  (innodb_page_size / 16 / 2) * innodb_rollback_segments * number of undo tablespaces
  ```
- If each transaction performs an
  [`INSERT`](insert.md "15.2.7 INSERT Statement") operation on a temporary
  table, the number of concurrent read-write transactions that
  `InnoDB` is capable of supporting is:

  ```none
  (innodb_page_size / 16) * innodb_rollback_segments
  ```
- If each transaction performs an
  [`INSERT`](insert.md "15.2.7 INSERT Statement")
  **and** an
  [`UPDATE`](update.md "15.2.17 UPDATE Statement") or
  [`DELETE`](delete.md "15.2.2 DELETE Statement") operation on a temporary
  table, the number of concurrent read-write transactions that
  `InnoDB` is capable of supporting is:

  ```none
  (innodb_page_size / 16 / 2) * innodb_rollback_segments
  ```
