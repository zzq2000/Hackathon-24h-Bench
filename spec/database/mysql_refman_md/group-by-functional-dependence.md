### 14.19.4 Detection of Functional Dependence

The following discussion provides several examples of the ways
in which MySQL detects functional dependencies. The examples use
this notation:

```sql
{X} -> {Y}
```

Understand this as “*`X`* uniquely
determines *`Y`*,” which also
means that *`Y`* is functionally
dependent on *`X`*.

The examples use the `world` database, which
can be downloaded from
<https://dev.mysql.com/doc/index-other.html>. You can find details
on how to install the database on the same page.

#### Functional Dependencies Derived from Keys

The following query selects, for each country, a count of
spoken languages:

```sql
SELECT co.Name, COUNT(*)
FROM countrylanguage cl, country co
WHERE cl.CountryCode = co.Code
GROUP BY co.Code;
```

`co.Code` is a primary key of
`co`, so all columns of `co`
are functionally dependent on it, as expressed using this
notation:

```sql
{co.Code} -> {co.*}
```

Thus, `co.name` is functionally dependent on
`GROUP BY` columns and the query is valid.

A `UNIQUE` index over a `NOT
NULL` column could be used instead of a primary key
and the same functional dependence would apply. (This is not
true for a `UNIQUE` index that permits
`NULL` values because it permits multiple
`NULL` values and in that case uniqueness is
lost.)

#### Functional Dependencies Derived from Multiple-Column Keys and from Equalities

This query selects, for each country, a list of all spoken
languages and how many people speak them:

```sql
SELECT co.Name, cl.Language,
cl.Percentage * co.Population / 100.0 AS SpokenBy
FROM countrylanguage cl, country co
WHERE cl.CountryCode = co.Code
GROUP BY cl.CountryCode, cl.Language;
```

The pair (`cl.CountryCode`,
`cl.Language`) is a two-column composite
primary key of `cl`, so that column pair
uniquely determines all columns of `cl`:

```sql
{cl.CountryCode, cl.Language} -> {cl.*}
```

Moreover, because of the equality in the
`WHERE` clause:

```sql
{cl.CountryCode} -> {co.Code}
```

And, because `co.Code` is primary key of
`co`:

```sql
{co.Code} -> {co.*}
```

“Uniquely determines” relationships are
transitive, therefore:

```sql
{cl.CountryCode, cl.Language} -> {cl.*,co.*}
```

As a result, the query is valid.

As with the previous example, a `UNIQUE` key
over `NOT NULL` columns could be used instead
of a primary key.

An `INNER JOIN` condition can be used instead
of `WHERE`. The same functional dependencies
apply:

```sql
SELECT co.Name, cl.Language,
cl.Percentage * co.Population/100.0 AS SpokenBy
FROM countrylanguage cl INNER JOIN country co
ON cl.CountryCode = co.Code
GROUP BY cl.CountryCode, cl.Language;
```

#### Functional Dependency Special Cases

Whereas an equality test in a `WHERE`
condition or `INNER JOIN` condition is
symmetric, an equality test in an outer join condition is not,
because tables play different roles.

Assume that referential integrity has been accidentally broken
and there exists a row of `countrylanguage`
without a corresponding row in `country`.
Consider the same query as in the previous example, but with a
`LEFT JOIN`:

```sql
SELECT co.Name, cl.Language,
cl.Percentage * co.Population/100.0 AS SpokenBy
FROM countrylanguage cl LEFT JOIN country co
ON cl.CountryCode = co.Code
GROUP BY cl.CountryCode, cl.Language;
```

For a given value of `cl.CountryCode`, the
value of `co.Code` in the join result is
either found in a matching row (determined by
`cl.CountryCode`) or is
`NULL`-complemented if there is no match
(also determined by `cl.CountryCode`). In
each case, this relationship applies:

```sql
{cl.CountryCode} -> {co.Code}
```

`cl.CountryCode` is itself functionally
dependent on {`cl.CountryCode`,
`cl.Language`} which is a primary key.

If in the join result `co.Code` is
`NULL`-complemented,
`co.Name` is as well. If
`co.Code` is not
`NULL`-complemented, then because
`co.Code` is a primary key, it determines
`co.Name`. Therefore, in all cases:

```sql
{co.Code} -> {co.Name}
```

Which yields:

```sql
{cl.CountryCode, cl.Language} -> {cl.*,co.*}
```

As a result, the query is valid.

However, suppose that the tables are swapped, as in this
query:

```sql
SELECT co.Name, cl.Language,
cl.Percentage * co.Population/100.0 AS SpokenBy
FROM country co LEFT JOIN countrylanguage cl
ON cl.CountryCode = co.Code
GROUP BY cl.CountryCode, cl.Language;
```

Now this relationship does *not* apply:

```sql
{cl.CountryCode, cl.Language} -> {cl.*,co.*}
```

Indeed, all `NULL`-complemented rows made for
`cl` is put into a single group (they have
both `GROUP BY` columns equal to
`NULL`), and inside this group the value of
`co.Name` can vary. The query is invalid and
MySQL rejects it.

Functional dependence in outer joins is thus linked to whether
determinant columns belong to the left or right side of the
`LEFT JOIN`. Determination of functional
dependence becomes more complex if there are nested outer
joins or the join condition does not consist entirely of
equality comparisons.

#### Functional Dependencies and Views

Suppose that a view on countries produces their code, their
name in uppercase, and how many different official languages
they have:

```sql
CREATE VIEW country2 AS
SELECT co.Code, UPPER(co.Name) AS UpperName,
COUNT(cl.Language) AS OfficialLanguages
FROM country AS co JOIN countrylanguage AS cl
ON cl.CountryCode = co.Code
WHERE cl.isOfficial = 'T'
GROUP BY co.Code;
```

This definition is valid because:

```sql
{co.Code} -> {co.*}
```

In the view result, the first selected column is
`co.Code`, which is also the group column and
thus determines all other selected expressions:

```sql
{country2.Code} -> {country2.*}
```

MySQL understands this and uses this information, as described
following.

This query displays countries, how many different official
languages they have, and how many cities they have, by joining
the view with the `city` table:

```sql
SELECT co2.Code, co2.UpperName, co2.OfficialLanguages,
COUNT(*) AS Cities
FROM country2 AS co2 JOIN city ci
ON ci.CountryCode = co2.Code
GROUP BY co2.Code;
```

This query is valid because, as seen previously:

```sql
{co2.Code} -> {co2.*}
```

MySQL is able to discover a functional dependency in the
result of a view and use that to validate a query which uses
the view. The same would be true if
`country2` were a derived table (or common
table expression), as in:

```sql
SELECT co2.Code, co2.UpperName, co2.OfficialLanguages,
COUNT(*) AS Cities
FROM
(
 SELECT co.Code, UPPER(co.Name) AS UpperName,
 COUNT(cl.Language) AS OfficialLanguages
 FROM country AS co JOIN countrylanguage AS cl
 ON cl.CountryCode=co.Code
 WHERE cl.isOfficial='T'
 GROUP BY co.Code
) AS co2
JOIN city ci ON ci.CountryCode = co2.Code
GROUP BY co2.Code;
```

#### Combinations of Functional Dependencies

MySQL is able to combine all of the preceding types of
functional dependencies (key based, equality based, view
based) to validate more complex queries.
