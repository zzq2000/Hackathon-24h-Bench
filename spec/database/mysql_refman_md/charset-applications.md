## 12.5 Configuring Application Character Set and Collation

For applications that store data using the default MySQL character
set and collation (`utf8mb4`,
`utf8mb4_0900_ai_ci`), no special configuration
should be needed. If applications require data storage using a
different character set or collation, you can configure character
set information several ways:

- Specify character settings per database. For example,
  applications that use one database might use the default of
  `utf8mb4`, whereas applications that use
  another database might use `sjis`.
- Specify character settings at server startup. This causes the
  server to use the given settings for all applications that do
  not make other arrangements.
- Specify character settings at configuration time, if you build
  MySQL from source. This causes the server to use the given
  settings as the defaults for all applications, without having
  to specify them at server startup.

When different applications require different character settings,
the per-database technique provides a good deal of flexibility. If
most or all applications use the same character set, specifying
character settings at server startup or configuration time may be
most convenient.

For the per-database or server-startup techniques, the settings
control the character set for data storage. Applications must also
tell the server which character set to use for client/server
communications, as described in the following instructions.

The examples shown here assume use of the
`latin1` character set and
`latin1_swedish_ci` collation in particular
contexts as an alternative to the defaults of
`utf8mb4` and
`utf8mb4_0900_ai_ci`.

- **Specify character settings per database.**
  To create a database such that its tables use a given
  default character set and collation for data storage, use a
  [`CREATE DATABASE`](create-database.md "15.1.12 CREATE DATABASE Statement") statement
  like this:

  ```sql
  CREATE DATABASE mydb
    CHARACTER SET latin1
    COLLATE latin1_swedish_ci;
  ```

  Tables created in the database use `latin1`
  and `latin1_swedish_ci` by default for any
  character columns.

  Applications that use the database should also configure their
  connection to the server each time they connect. This can be
  done by executing a `SET NAMES 'latin1'`
  statement after connecting. The statement can be used
  regardless of connection method (the [**mysql**](mysql.md "6.5.1 mysql — The MySQL Command-Line Client")
  client, PHP scripts, and so forth).

  In some cases, it may be possible to configure the connection
  to use the desired character set some other way. For example,
  to connect using [**mysql**](mysql.md "6.5.1 mysql — The MySQL Command-Line Client"), you can specify the
  [`--default-character-set=latin1`](mysql-command-options.md#option_mysql_default-character-set)
  command-line option to achieve the same effect as `SET
  NAMES 'latin1'`.

  For more information about configuring client connections, see
  [Section 12.4, “Connection Character Sets and Collations”](charset-connection.md "12.4 Connection Character Sets and Collations").

  Note

  If you use [`ALTER DATABASE`](alter-database.md "15.1.2 ALTER DATABASE Statement") to
  change the database default character set or collation,
  existing stored routines in the database that use those
  defaults must be dropped and recreated so that they use the
  new defaults. (In a stored routine, variables with character
  data types use the database defaults if the character set or
  collation are not specified explicitly. See
  [Section 15.1.17, “CREATE PROCEDURE and CREATE FUNCTION Statements”](create-procedure.md "15.1.17 CREATE PROCEDURE and CREATE FUNCTION Statements").)
- **Specify character settings at server startup.**
  To select a character set and collation at server startup,
  use the
  [`--character-set-server`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_character_set_server) and
  [`--collation-server`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_collation_server) options.
  For example, to specify the options in an option file,
  include these lines:

  ```ini
  [mysqld]
  character-set-server=latin1
  collation-server=latin1_swedish_ci
  ```

  These settings apply server-wide and apply as the defaults for
  databases created by any application, and for tables created
  in those databases.

  It is still necessary for applications to configure their
  connection using [`SET NAMES`](set-names.md "15.7.6.3 SET NAMES Statement") or
  equivalent after they connect, as described previously. You
  might be tempted to start the server with the
  [`--init_connect="SET NAMES
  'latin1'"`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_init_connect) option to cause [`SET
  NAMES`](set-names.md "15.7.6.3 SET NAMES Statement") to be executed automatically for each client
  that connects. However, this may yield inconsistent results
  because the [`init_connect`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_init_connect)
  value is not executed for users who have the
  [`CONNECTION_ADMIN`](privileges-provided.md#priv_connection-admin) privilege (or
  the deprecated [`SUPER`](privileges-provided.md#priv_super)
  privilege).
- **Specify character settings at MySQL configuration time.**
  To select a character set and collation if you configure and
  build MySQL from source, use the
  [`DEFAULT_CHARSET`](source-configuration-options.md#option_cmake_default_charset) and
  [`DEFAULT_COLLATION`](source-configuration-options.md#option_cmake_default_collation)
  **CMake** options:

  ```terminal
  cmake . -DDEFAULT_CHARSET=latin1 \
    -DDEFAULT_COLLATION=latin1_swedish_ci
  ```

  The resulting server uses `latin1` and
  `latin1_swedish_ci` as the default for
  databases and tables and for client connections. It is
  unnecessary to use
  [`--character-set-server`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_character_set_server) and
  [`--collation-server`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_collation_server) to specify
  those defaults at server startup. It is also unnecessary for
  applications to configure their connection using
  [`SET NAMES`](set-names.md "15.7.6.3 SET NAMES Statement") or equivalent after
  they connect to the server.

Regardless of how you configure the MySQL character set for
application use, you must also consider the environment within
which those applications execute. For example, if you intend to
send statements using UTF-8 text taken from a file that you create
in an editor, you should edit the file with the locale of your
environment set to UTF-8 so that the file encoding is correct and
so that the operating system handles it correctly. If you use the
[**mysql**](mysql.md "6.5.1 mysql — The MySQL Command-Line Client") client from within a terminal window, the
window must be configured to use UTF-8 or characters may not
display properly. For a script that executes in a Web environment,
the script must handle character encoding properly for its
interaction with the MySQL server, and it must generate pages that
correctly indicate the encoding so that browsers know how to
display the content of the pages. For example, you can include
this `<meta>` tag within your
`<head>` element:

```html
<meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html; charset=utf-8" />
```
