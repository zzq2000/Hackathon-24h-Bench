### 8.1.5 How to Run MySQL as a Normal User

On Windows, you can run the server as a Windows service using a
normal user account.

On Linux, for installations performed using a MySQL repository or
RPM packages, the MySQL server [**mysqld**](mysqld.md "6.3.1 mysqld — The MySQL Server") should be
started by the local `mysql` operating system
user. Starting by another operating system user is not supported
by the init scripts that are included as part of the MySQL
repositories.

On Unix (or Linux for installations performed using
`tar.gz` packages) , the MySQL server
[**mysqld**](mysqld.md "6.3.1 mysqld — The MySQL Server") can be started and run by any user.
However, you should avoid running the server as the Unix
`root` user for security reasons. To change
[**mysqld**](mysqld.md "6.3.1 mysqld — The MySQL Server") to run as a normal unprivileged Unix
user *`user_name`*, you must do the
following:

1. Stop the server if it is running (use [**mysqladmin
   shutdown**](mysqladmin.md "6.5.2 mysqladmin — A MySQL Server Administration Program")).
2. Change the database directories and files so that
   *`user_name`* has privileges to read
   and write files in them (you might need to do this as the Unix
   `root` user):

   ```terminal
   $> chown -R user_name /path/to/mysql/datadir
   ```

   If you do not do this, the server cannot access databases or
   tables when it runs as *`user_name`*.

   If directories or files within the MySQL data directory are
   symbolic links, `chown -R` might not follow
   symbolic links for you. If it does not, you must also follow
   those links and change the directories and files they point
   to.
3. Start the server as user *`user_name`*.
   Another alternative is to start [**mysqld**](mysqld.md "6.3.1 mysqld — The MySQL Server") as
   the Unix `root` user and use the
   [`--user=user_name`](server-options.md#option_mysqld_user)
   option. [**mysqld**](mysqld.md "6.3.1 mysqld — The MySQL Server") starts, then switches to run
   as the Unix user *`user_name`* before
   accepting any connections.
4. To start the server as the given user automatically at system
   startup time, specify the user name by adding a
   `user` option to the
   `[mysqld]` group of the
   `/etc/my.cnf` option file or the
   `my.cnf` option file in the server's data
   directory. For example:

   ```ini
   [mysqld]
   user=user_name
   ```

If your Unix machine itself is not secured, you should assign
passwords to the MySQL `root` account in the
grant tables. Otherwise, any user with a login account on that
machine can run the [**mysql**](mysql.md "6.5.1 mysql — The MySQL Command-Line Client") client with a
[`--user=root`](mysql-command-options.md#option_mysql_user) option and perform any
operation. (It is a good idea to assign passwords to MySQL
accounts in any case, but especially so when other login accounts
exist on the server host.) See
[Section 2.9.4, “Securing the Initial MySQL Account”](default-privileges.md "2.9.4 Securing the Initial MySQL Account").
