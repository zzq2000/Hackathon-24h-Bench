### 11.2.5 Function Name Parsing and Resolution

MySQL supports built-in (native) functions, loadable functions,
and stored functions. This section describes how the server
recognizes whether the name of a built-in function is used as a
function call or as an identifier, and how the server determines
which function to use in cases when functions of different types
exist with a given name.

- [Function Name Resolution](function-resolution.md#function-name-resolution "Function Name Resolution")

#### Built-In Function Name Parsing

The parser uses default rules for parsing names of built-in
functions. These rules can be changed by enabling the
[`IGNORE_SPACE`](sql-mode.md#sqlmode_ignore_space) SQL mode.

When the parser encounters a word that is the name of a
built-in function, it must determine whether the name
signifies a function call or is instead a nonexpression
reference to an identifier such as a table or column name. For
example, in the following statements, the first reference to
`count` is a function call, whereas the
second reference is a table name:

```sql
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM mytable;
CREATE TABLE count (i INT);
```

The parser should recognize the name of a built-in function as
indicating a function call only when parsing what is expected
to be an expression. That is, in nonexpression context,
function names are permitted as identifiers.

However, some built-in functions have special parsing or
implementation considerations, so the parser uses the
following rules by default to distinguish whether their names
are being used as function calls or as identifiers in
nonexpression context:

- To use the name as a function call in an expression, there
  must be no whitespace between the name and the following
  `(` parenthesis character.
- Conversely, to use the function name as an identifier, it
  must not be followed immediately by a parenthesis.

The requirement that function calls be written with no
whitespace between the name and the parenthesis applies only
to the built-in functions that have special considerations.
`COUNT` is one such name. The
`sql/lex.h` source file lists the names of
these special functions for which following whitespace
determines their interpretation: names defined by the
`SYM_FN()` macro in the
`symbols[]` array.

The following list names the functions in MySQL
8.0 that are affected by the
[`IGNORE_SPACE`](sql-mode.md#sqlmode_ignore_space) setting and
listed as special in the `sql/lex.h` source
file. You may find it easiest to treat the no-whitespace
requirement as applying to all function calls.

- `ADDDATE`
- `BIT_AND`
- `BIT_OR`
- `BIT_XOR`
- `CAST`
- `COUNT`
- `CURDATE`
- `CURTIME`
- `DATE_ADD`
- `DATE_SUB`
- `EXTRACT`
- `GROUP_CONCAT`
- `MAX`
- `MID`
- `MIN`
- `NOW`
- `POSITION`
- `SESSION_USER`
- `STD`
- `STDDEV`
- `STDDEV_POP`
- `STDDEV_SAMP`
- `SUBDATE`
- `SUBSTR`
- `SUBSTRING`
- `SUM`
- `SYSDATE`
- `SYSTEM_USER`
- `TRIM`
- `VARIANCE`
- `VAR_POP`
- `VAR_SAMP`

For functions not listed as special in
`sql/lex.h`, whitespace does not matter.
They are interpreted as function calls only when used in
expression context and may be used freely as identifiers
otherwise. `ASCII` is one such name. However,
for these nonaffected function names, interpretation may vary
in expression context:
`func_name ()` is
interpreted as a built-in function if there is one with the
given name; if not,
`func_name ()` is
interpreted as a loadable function or stored function if one
exists with that name.

The [`IGNORE_SPACE`](sql-mode.md#sqlmode_ignore_space) SQL mode
can be used to modify how the parser treats function names
that are whitespace-sensitive:

- With [`IGNORE_SPACE`](sql-mode.md#sqlmode_ignore_space)
  disabled, the parser interprets the name as a function
  call when there is no whitespace between the name and the
  following parenthesis. This occurs even when the function
  name is used in nonexpression context:

  ```sql
  mysql> CREATE TABLE count(i INT);
  ERROR 1064 (42000): You have an error in your SQL syntax ...
  near 'count(i INT)'
  ```

  To eliminate the error and cause the name to be treated as
  an identifier, either use whitespace following the name or
  write it as a quoted identifier (or both):

  ```sql
  CREATE TABLE count (i INT);
  CREATE TABLE `count`(i INT);
  CREATE TABLE `count` (i INT);
  ```
- With [`IGNORE_SPACE`](sql-mode.md#sqlmode_ignore_space)
  enabled, the parser loosens the requirement that there be
  no whitespace between the function name and the following
  parenthesis. This provides more flexibility in writing
  function calls. For example, either of the following
  function calls are legal:

  ```sql
  SELECT COUNT(*) FROM mytable;
  SELECT COUNT (*) FROM mytable;
  ```

  However, enabling
  [`IGNORE_SPACE`](sql-mode.md#sqlmode_ignore_space) also has
  the side effect that the parser treats the affected
  function names as reserved words (see
  [Section 11.3, “Keywords and Reserved Words”](keywords.md "11.3 Keywords and Reserved Words")). This means that a space
  following the name no longer signifies its use as an
  identifier. The name can be used in function calls with or
  without following whitespace, but causes a syntax error in
  nonexpression context unless it is quoted. For example,
  with [`IGNORE_SPACE`](sql-mode.md#sqlmode_ignore_space)
  enabled, both of the following statements fail with a
  syntax error because the parser interprets
  `count` as a reserved word:

  ```sql
  CREATE TABLE count(i INT);
  CREATE TABLE count (i INT);
  ```

  To use the function name in nonexpression context, write
  it as a quoted identifier:

  ```sql
  CREATE TABLE `count`(i INT);
  CREATE TABLE `count` (i INT);
  ```

To enable the [`IGNORE_SPACE`](sql-mode.md#sqlmode_ignore_space)
SQL mode, use this statement:

```sql
SET sql_mode = 'IGNORE_SPACE';
```

[`IGNORE_SPACE`](sql-mode.md#sqlmode_ignore_space) is also enabled
by certain other composite modes such as
[`ANSI`](sql-mode.md#sqlmode_ansi) that include it in
their value:

```sql
SET sql_mode = 'ANSI';
```

Check [Section 7.1.11, “Server SQL Modes”](sql-mode.md "7.1.11 Server SQL Modes"), to see which composite modes
enable [`IGNORE_SPACE`](sql-mode.md#sqlmode_ignore_space).

To minimize the dependency of SQL code on the
[`IGNORE_SPACE`](sql-mode.md#sqlmode_ignore_space) setting, use
these guidelines:

- Avoid creating loadable functions or stored functions that
  have the same name as a built-in function.
- Avoid using function names in nonexpression context. For
  example, these statements use `count`
  (one of the affected function names affected by
  [`IGNORE_SPACE`](sql-mode.md#sqlmode_ignore_space)), so they
  fail with or without whitespace following the name if
  [`IGNORE_SPACE`](sql-mode.md#sqlmode_ignore_space) is enabled:

  ```sql
  CREATE TABLE count(i INT);
  CREATE TABLE count (i INT);
  ```

  If you must use a function name in nonexpression context,
  write it as a quoted identifier:

  ```sql
  CREATE TABLE `count`(i INT);
  CREATE TABLE `count` (i INT);
  ```

#### Function Name Resolution

The following rules describe how the server resolves
references to function names for function creation and
invocation:

- Built-in functions and loadable functions

  An error occurs if you try to create a loadable function
  with the same name as a built-in function.

  `IF NOT EXISTS` (available beginning with
  MySQL 8.0.29) has no effect in such cases. See
  [Section 15.7.4.1, “CREATE FUNCTION Statement for Loadable Functions”](create-function-loadable.md "15.7.4.1 CREATE FUNCTION Statement for Loadable Functions"), for more
  information.
- Built-in functions and stored functions

  It is possible to create a stored function with the same
  name as a built-in function, but to invoke the stored
  function it is necessary to qualify it with a schema name.
  For example, if you create a stored function named
  `PI` in the `test`
  schema, invoke it as `test.PI()` because
  the server resolves [`PI()`](mathematical-functions.md#function_pi)
  without a qualifier as a reference to the built-in
  function. The server generates a warning if the stored
  function name collides with a built-in function name. The
  warning can be displayed with [`SHOW
  WARNINGS`](show-warnings.md "15.7.7.42 SHOW WARNINGS Statement").

  `IF NOT EXISTS` (MySQL 8.0.29 and later)
  has no effect in such cases; see
  [Section 15.1.17, “CREATE PROCEDURE and CREATE FUNCTION Statements”](create-procedure.md "15.1.17 CREATE PROCEDURE and CREATE FUNCTION Statements").
- Loadable functions and stored functions

  It is possible to create a stored function with the same
  name as an existing loadable function, or the other way
  around. The server generates a warning if a proposed
  stored function name collides with an existing loadable
  function name, or if a proposed loadable function name
  would be the same as that of an existing stored function.
  In either case, once both functions exist, it is necessary
  thereafter to qualify the stored function with a schema
  name when invoking it; the server assumes in such cases
  that the unqualified name refers to the loadable function.

  Beginning with MySQL 8.0.29, `IF NOT
  EXISTS` is supported with
  [`CREATE FUNCTION`](create-function.md "15.1.14 CREATE FUNCTION Statement") statements,
  but has no effect in such cases.

  Prior to MySQL 8.0.28, it was possible to create a stored
  function with the same name as an existing loadable
  function, but not the other way around (Bug #33301931
  ).

The preceding function name resolution rules have implications
for upgrading to versions of MySQL that implement new built-in
functions:

- If you have already created a loadable function with a
  given name and upgrade MySQL to a version that implements
  a new built-in function with the same name, the loadable
  function becomes inaccessible. To correct this, use
  [`DROP FUNCTION`](drop-function.md "15.1.26 DROP FUNCTION Statement") to drop the
  loadable function and [`CREATE
  FUNCTION`](create-function.md "15.1.14 CREATE FUNCTION Statement") to re-create the loadable function with
  a different nonconflicting name. Then modify any affected
  code to use the new name.
- If a new version of MySQL implements a built-in function
  or loadable function with the same name as an existing
  stored function, you have two choices: Rename the stored
  function to use a nonconflicting name, or change any calls
  to the function that do not do so already to use a schema
  qualifier
  (`schema_name.func_name()`
  syntax). In either case, modify any affected code
  accordingly.
