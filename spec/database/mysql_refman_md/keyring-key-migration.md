#### 8.4.4.14 Migrating Keys Between Keyring Keystores

A keyring migration copies keys from one keystore to another,
enabling a DBA to switch a MySQL installation to a different
keystore. A successful migration operation has this result:

- The destination keystore contains the keys it had prior to
  the migration, plus the keys from the source keystore.
- The source keystore remains the same before and after the
  migration (because keys are copied, not moved).

If a key to be copied already exists in the destination
keystore, an error occurs and the destination keystore is
restored to its premigration state.

The keyring manages keystores using keyring components and
keyring plugins. This pertains to migration strategy because the
way in which the source and destination keystores are managed
determines whether a particular type of key migration is
possible and the procedure for performing it:

- Migration from one keyring plugin to another: The MySQL
  server has an operational mode that provides this
  capability.
- Migration from a keyring plugin to a keyring component: The
  MySQL server has an operational mode that provides this
  capability as of MySQL 8.0.24.
- Migration from one keyring component to another: The
  [**mysql\_migrate\_keyring**](mysql-migrate-keyring.md "6.6.8 mysql_migrate_keyring — Keyring Key Migration Utility") utility provides
  this capability. [**mysql\_migrate\_keyring**](mysql-migrate-keyring.md "6.6.8 mysql_migrate_keyring — Keyring Key Migration Utility") is
  available as of MySQL 8.0.24.
- Migration from a keyring component to a keyring plugin:
  There is no provision for this capability.

The following sections discuss the characteristics of offline
and online migrations and describe how to perform migrations.

- [Key Migration Using a Migration Server](keyring-key-migration.md#keyring-key-migration-using-migration-server "Key Migration Using a Migration Server")
- [Key Migration Using the mysql\_migrate\_keyring Utility](keyring-key-migration.md#keyring-key-migration-using-mysql-migrate-keyring "Key Migration Using the mysql_migrate_keyring Utility")
- [Key Migration Involving Multiple Running Servers](keyring-key-migration.md#keyring-key-migration-multiple-running-servers "Key Migration Involving Multiple Running Servers")

##### Offline and Online Key Migrations

A key migration is either offline or online:

- Offline migration: For use when you are sure that no
  running server on the local host is using the source or
  destination keystore. In this case, the migration
  operation can copy keys from the source keystore to the
  destination without the possibility of a running server
  modifying keystore content during the operation.
- Online migration: For use when a running server on the
  local host is using the source keystore. In this case,
  care must be taken to prevent that server from updating
  keystores during the migration. This involves connecting
  to the running server and instructing it to pause keyring
  operations so that keys can be copied safely from the
  source keystore to the destination. When key copying is
  complete, the running server is permitted to resume
  keyring operations.

When you plan a key migration, use these points to decide
whether it should be offline or online:

- Do not perform offline migration involving a keystore that
  is in use by a running server.
- Pausing keyring operations during an online migration is
  accomplished by connecting to the running server and
  setting its global
  [`keyring_operations`](keyring-system-variables.md#sysvar_keyring_operations) system
  variable to `OFF` before key copying and
  `ON` after key copying. This has several
  implications:

  - [`keyring_operations`](keyring-system-variables.md#sysvar_keyring_operations)
    was introduced in MySQL 5.7.21, so online migration is
    possible only if the running server is from MySQL
    5.7.21 or higher. If the running server is older, you
    must stop it, perform an offline migration, and
    restart it. All migration instructions elsewhere that
    refer to
    [`keyring_operations`](keyring-system-variables.md#sysvar_keyring_operations)
    are subject to this condition.
  - The account used to connect to the running server must
    have the privileges required to modify
    [`keyring_operations`](keyring-system-variables.md#sysvar_keyring_operations).
    These privileges are
    [`ENCRYPTION_KEY_ADMIN`](privileges-provided.md#priv_encryption-key-admin) in
    addition to either
    [`SYSTEM_VARIABLES_ADMIN`](privileges-provided.md#priv_system-variables-admin)
    or the deprecated [`SUPER`](privileges-provided.md#priv_super)
    privilege.
  - If an online migration operation exits abnormally (for
    example, if it is forcibly terminated), it is possible
    for
    [`keyring_operations`](keyring-system-variables.md#sysvar_keyring_operations) to
    remain disabled on the running server, leaving it
    unable to perform keyring operations. In this case, it
    may be necessary to connect to the running server and
    enable
    [`keyring_operations`](keyring-system-variables.md#sysvar_keyring_operations)
    manually using this statement:

    ```sql
    SET GLOBAL keyring_operations = ON;
    ```
- Online key migration provides for pausing keyring
  operations on a single running server. To perform a
  migration if multiple running servers are using the
  keystores involved, use the procedure described at
  [Key Migration Involving Multiple Running Servers](keyring-key-migration.md#keyring-key-migration-multiple-running-servers "Key Migration Involving Multiple Running Servers").

##### Key Migration Using a Migration Server

Note

Online key migration using a migration server is only
supported if the running server allows socket connections or
TCP/IP connections using TLS; it is not supported when, for
example, the server is running on a Windows platform and
only allows shared memory connections.

A MySQL server becomes a migration server if invoked in a
special operational mode that supports key migration. A
migration server does not accept client connections. Instead,
it runs only long enough to migrate keys, then exits. A
migration server reports errors to the console (the standard
error output).

A migration server supports these migration types:

- Migration from one keyring plugin to another.
- Migration from a keyring plugin to a keyring component.
  This capability is available as of MySQL 8.0.24. Older
  servers support only migration from one keyring plugin to
  another, in which case the parts of these instructions
  that refer to keyring components do not apply.

A migration server does not support migration from one keyring
component to another. For that type of migration, see
[Key Migration Using the mysql\_migrate\_keyring Utility](keyring-key-migration.md#keyring-key-migration-using-mysql-migrate-keyring "Key Migration Using the mysql_migrate_keyring Utility").

To perform a key migration operation using a migration server,
determine the key migration options required to specify which
keyring plugins or components are involved, and whether the
migration is offline or online:

- To indicate the source keyring plugin and the destination
  keyring plugin or component, specify these options:

  - [`--keyring-migration-source`](keyring-options.md#option_mysqld_keyring-migration-source):
    The source keyring plugin that manages the keys to be
    migrated.
  - [`--keyring-migration-destination`](keyring-options.md#option_mysqld_keyring-migration-destination):
    The destination keyring plugin or component to which
    the migrated keys are to be copied.
  - [`--keyring-migration-to-component`](keyring-options.md#option_mysqld_keyring-migration-to-component):
    This option is required if the destination is a
    keyring component rather than a keyring plugin.

  The
  [`--keyring-migration-source`](keyring-options.md#option_mysqld_keyring-migration-source)
  and
  [`--keyring-migration-destination`](keyring-options.md#option_mysqld_keyring-migration-destination)
  options signify to the server that it should run in key
  migration mode. For key migration operations, both options
  are mandatory. Each plugin or component is specified using
  the name of its library file, including any
  platform-specific extension such as
  `.so` or `.dll`. The
  source and destination must differ, and the migration
  server must support them both.
- For an offline migration, no additional key migration
  options are needed.
- For an online migration, some running server currently is
  using the source or destination keystore. To invoke the
  migration server, specify additional key migration options
  that indicate how to connect to the running server. This
  is necessary so that the migration server can connect to
  the running server and tell it to pause keyring use during
  the migration operation.

  Use of any of the following options signifies an online
  migration:

  - [`--keyring-migration-host`](keyring-options.md#option_mysqld_keyring-migration-host):
    The host where the running server is located. This is
    always the local host because the migration server can
    migrate keys only between keystores managed by local
    plugins and components.
  - [`--keyring-migration-user`](keyring-options.md#option_mysqld_keyring-migration-user),
    [`--keyring-migration-password`](keyring-options.md#option_mysqld_keyring-migration-password):
    The account credentials to use to connect to the
    running server.
  - [`--keyring-migration-port`](keyring-options.md#option_mysqld_keyring-migration-port):
    For TCP/IP connections, the port number to connect to
    on the running server.
  - [`--keyring-migration-socket`](keyring-options.md#option_mysqld_keyring-migration-socket):
    For Unix socket file or Windows named pipe
    connections, the socket file or named pipe to connect
    to on the running server.

For additional details about the key migration options, see
[Section 8.4.4.18, “Keyring Command Options”](keyring-options.md "8.4.4.18 Keyring Command Options").

Start the migration server with key migration options
indicating the source and destination keystores and whether
the migration is offline or online, possibly with other
options. Keep the following considerations in mind:

- Other server options might be required, such as
  configuration parameters for the two keyring plugins. For
  example, if `keyring_file` is the source
  or destination, you must set the
  [`keyring_file_data`](keyring-system-variables.md#sysvar_keyring_file_data) system
  variable if the keyring data file location is not the
  default location. Other non-keyring options may be
  required as well. One way to specify these options is by
  using [`--defaults-file`](option-file-options.md#option_general_defaults-file) to
  name an option file that contains the required options.

  - The migration server must not start up with its own
    keyring. This means that
    [`--defaults-file`](option-file-options.md#option_general_defaults-file) must
    not point to the same options file that is used to
    start the running server if it contains a line such as
    `early-plugin-load=keyring_file.so`.
    Instead, it must point to a separate file that only
    contains options relevant to the migration.
  - If migrating from a plugin to a component, the
    component manifest file (`mysqld.my`)
    must not be present in the `bin`
    directory. However, the component configuration (for
    example,
    `component_keyring_file.cnf`) should
    be present in the plugin directory, so that the new
    keyring can be populated. After the migration is
    complete, add the manifest file to the directory and
    restart the MySQL server, so that the server starts
    using the new keyring.
- The migration server expects path name option values to be
  full paths. Relative path names may not be resolved as you
  expect.
- The user who invokes a server in key-migration mode must
  not be the `root` operating system user,
  unless the [`--user`](server-options.md#option_mysqld_user) option is
  specified with a non-`root` user name to
  run the server as that user.
- The user a server in key-migration mode runs as must have
  permission to read and write any local keyring files, such
  as the data file for a file-based plugin.

  If you invoke the migration server from a system account
  different from that normally used to run MySQL, it might
  create keyring directories or files that are inaccessible
  to the server during normal operation. Suppose that
  [**mysqld**](mysqld.md "6.3.1 mysqld — The MySQL Server") normally runs as the
  `mysql` operating system user, but you
  invoke the migration server while logged in as
  `isabel`. Any new directories or files
  created by the migration server are owned by
  `isabel`. Subsequent startup fails when a
  server run as the `mysql` operating
  system user attempts to access file system objects owned
  by `isabel`.

  To avoid this issue, start the migration server as the
  `root` operating system user and provide
  a
  [`--user=user_name`](server-options.md#option_mysqld_user)
  option, where *`user_name`* is the
  system account normally used to run MySQL. Alternatively,
  after the migration, examine the keyring-related file
  system objects and change their ownership and permissions
  if necessary using **chown**,
  **chmod**, or similar commands, so that the
  objects are accessible to the running server.

Example command line for offline migration between two keyring
plugins (enter the command on a single line):

```terminal
mysqld --defaults-file=/usr/local/mysql/etc/my.cnf
  --keyring-migration-source=keyring_file.so
  --keyring-migration-destination=keyring_encrypted_file.so
  --keyring_encrypted_file_password=password
```

Example command line for online migration between two keyring
plugins:

```terminal
mysqld --defaults-file=/usr/local/mysql/etc/my.cnf
  --keyring-migration-source=keyring_file.so
  --keyring-migration-destination=keyring_encrypted_file.so
  --keyring_encrypted_file_password=password
  --keyring-migration-host=127.0.0.1
  --keyring-migration-user=root
  --keyring-migration-password=root_password
```

To perform a migration when the destination is a keyring
component rather than a keyring plugin, specify the
[`--keyring-migration-to-component`](keyring-options.md#option_mysqld_keyring-migration-to-component)
option, and name the component as the value of the
[`--keyring-migration-destination`](keyring-options.md#option_mysqld_keyring-migration-destination)
option.

Example command line for offline migration from a keyring
plugin to a keyring component:

```terminal
mysqld --defaults-file=/usr/local/mysql/etc/my.cnf
  --keyring-migration-to-component
  --keyring-migration-source=keyring_file.so
  --keyring-migration-destination=component_keyring_encrypted_file.so
```

Notice that in this case, no
`keyring_encrypted_file_password` value is
specified. The password for the component data file is listed
in the component configuration file.

Example command line for online migration from a keyring
plugin to a keyring component:

```terminal
mysqld --defaults-file=/usr/local/mysql/etc/my.cnf
  --keyring-migration-to-component
  --keyring-migration-source=keyring_file.so
  --keyring-migration-destination=component_keyring_encrypted_file.so
  --keyring-migration-host=127.0.0.1
  --keyring-migration-user=root
  --keyring-migration-password=root_password
```

The key migration server performs a migration operation as
follows:

1. (Online migration only) Connect to the running server
   using the connection options.
2. (Online migration only) Disable
   [`keyring_operations`](keyring-system-variables.md#sysvar_keyring_operations) on the
   running server.
3. Load the keyring plugin/component libraries for the source
   and destination keystores.
4. Copy keys from the source keystore to the destination.
5. Unload the keyring plugin/component libraries for the
   source and destination keystores.
6. (Online migration only) Enable
   [`keyring_operations`](keyring-system-variables.md#sysvar_keyring_operations) on the
   running server.
7. (Online migration only) Disconnect from the running
   server.

If an error occurs during key migration, the destination
keystore is restored to its premigration state.

After a successful online key migration operation, the running
server might need to be restarted:

- If the running server was using the source keystore before
  the migration and should continue to use it after the
  migration, it need not be restarted after the migration.
- If the running server was using the destination keystore
  before the migration and should continue to use it after
  the migration, it should be restarted after the migration
  to load all keys migrated into the destination keystore.
- If the running server was using the source keystore before
  the migration but should use the destination keystore
  after the migration, it must be reconfigured to use the
  destination keystore and restarted. In this case, be aware
  that although the running server is paused from modifying
  the source keystore during the migration itself, it is not
  paused during the interval between the migration and the
  subsequent restart. Care should be taken that the server
  does not modify the source keystore during this interval
  because any such changes will not be reflected in the
  destination keystore.

##### Key Migration Using the mysql\_migrate\_keyring Utility

The [**mysql\_migrate\_keyring**](mysql-migrate-keyring.md "6.6.8 mysql_migrate_keyring — Keyring Key Migration Utility") utility migrates
keys from one keyring component to another. It does not
support migrations involving keyring plugins. For that type of
migration, use a MySQL server operating in key migration mode;
see
[Key Migration Using a Migration Server](keyring-key-migration.md#keyring-key-migration-using-migration-server "Key Migration Using a Migration Server").

To perform a key migration operation using
[**mysql\_migrate\_keyring**](mysql-migrate-keyring.md "6.6.8 mysql_migrate_keyring — Keyring Key Migration Utility"), determine the key
migration options required to specify which keyring components
are involved, and whether the migration is offline or online:

- To indicate the source and destination keyring components
  and their location, specify these options:

  - [`--source-keyring`](mysql-migrate-keyring.md#option_mysql_migrate_keyring_source-keyring):
    The source keyring component that manages the keys to
    be migrated.
  - [`--destination-keyring`](mysql-migrate-keyring.md#option_mysql_migrate_keyring_destination-keyring):
    The destination keyring component to which the
    migrated keys are to be copied.
  - `--component-dir`:
    The directory containing keyring component library
    files. This is typically the value of the
    [`plugin_dir`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_plugin_dir) system
    variable for the local MySQL server.

  All three options are mandatory. Each keyring component
  name is a component library file name specified without
  any platform-specific extension such as
  `.so` or `.dll`. For
  example, to use the component for which the library file
  is `component_keyring_file.so`, specify
  the option as
  [`--source-keyring=component_keyring_file`](mysql-migrate-keyring.md#option_mysql_migrate_keyring_source-keyring).
  The source and destination must differ, and
  [**mysql\_migrate\_keyring**](mysql-migrate-keyring.md "6.6.8 mysql_migrate_keyring — Keyring Key Migration Utility") must support them
  both.
- For an offline migration, no additional options are
  needed.
- For an online migration, some running server currently is
  using the source or destination keystore. In this case,
  specify the
  `--online-migration`
  option to signify an online migration. In addition,
  specify connection options indicating how to connect to
  the running server, so that
  [**mysql\_migrate\_keyring**](mysql-migrate-keyring.md "6.6.8 mysql_migrate_keyring — Keyring Key Migration Utility") can connect to it
  and tell it to pause keyring use during the migration
  operation.

  The
  `--online-migration`
  option is commonly used in conjunction with connection
  options such as these:

  - [`--host`](mysql-migrate-keyring.md#option_mysql_migrate_keyring_host):
    The host where the running server is located. This is
    always the local host because
    [**mysql\_migrate\_keyring**](mysql-migrate-keyring.md "6.6.8 mysql_migrate_keyring — Keyring Key Migration Utility") can migrate
    keys only between keystores managed by local
    components.
  - [`--user`](mysql-migrate-keyring.md#option_mysql_migrate_keyring_user),
    [`--password`](mysql-migrate-keyring.md#option_mysql_migrate_keyring_password):
    The account credentials to use to connect to the
    running server.
  - [`--port`](mysql-migrate-keyring.md#option_mysql_migrate_keyring_port):
    For TCP/IP connections, the port number to connect to
    on the running server.
  - [`--socket`](mysql-migrate-keyring.md#option_mysql_migrate_keyring_socket):
    For Unix socket file or Windows named pipe
    connections, the socket file or named pipe to connect
    to on the running server.

For descriptions of all available options, see
[Section 6.6.8, “mysql\_migrate\_keyring — Keyring Key Migration Utility”](mysql-migrate-keyring.md "6.6.8 mysql_migrate_keyring — Keyring Key Migration Utility").

Start [**mysql\_migrate\_keyring**](mysql-migrate-keyring.md "6.6.8 mysql_migrate_keyring — Keyring Key Migration Utility") with options
indicating the source and destination keystores and whether
the migration is offline or online, possibly with other
options. Keep the following considerations in mind:

- The user who invokes
  [**mysql\_migrate\_keyring**](mysql-migrate-keyring.md "6.6.8 mysql_migrate_keyring — Keyring Key Migration Utility") must not be the
  `root` operating system user.
- The user who invokes
  [**mysql\_migrate\_keyring**](mysql-migrate-keyring.md "6.6.8 mysql_migrate_keyring — Keyring Key Migration Utility") must have
  permission to read and write any local keyring files, such
  as the data file for a file-based plugin.

  If you invoke [**mysql\_migrate\_keyring**](mysql-migrate-keyring.md "6.6.8 mysql_migrate_keyring — Keyring Key Migration Utility")
  from a system account different from that normally used to
  run MySQL, it might create keyring directories or files
  that are inaccessible to the server during normal
  operation. Suppose that [**mysqld**](mysqld.md "6.3.1 mysqld — The MySQL Server") normally
  runs as the `mysql` operating system
  user, but you invoke
  [**mysql\_migrate\_keyring**](mysql-migrate-keyring.md "6.6.8 mysql_migrate_keyring — Keyring Key Migration Utility") while logged in
  as `isabel`. Any new directories or files
  created by [**mysql\_migrate\_keyring**](mysql-migrate-keyring.md "6.6.8 mysql_migrate_keyring — Keyring Key Migration Utility") are
  owned by `isabel`. Subsequent startup
  fails when a server run as the `mysql`
  operating system user attempts to access file system
  objects owned by `isabel`.

  To avoid this issue, invoke
  [**mysql\_migrate\_keyring**](mysql-migrate-keyring.md "6.6.8 mysql_migrate_keyring — Keyring Key Migration Utility") as the
  `mysql` operating system user.
  Alternatively, after the migration, examine the
  keyring-related file system objects and change their
  ownership and permissions if necessary using
  **chown**, **chmod**, or
  similar commands, so that the objects are accessible to
  the running server.

Suppose that you want to migrate keys from
`component_keyring_file` to
`component_keyring_encrypted_file`, and that
the local server stores its keyring component library files in
`/usr/local/mysql/lib/plugin`.

If no running server is using the keyring, an offline
migration is permitted. Invoke
[**mysql\_migrate\_keyring**](mysql-migrate-keyring.md "6.6.8 mysql_migrate_keyring — Keyring Key Migration Utility") like this (enter the
command on a single line):

```terminal
mysql_migrate_keyring
  --component-dir=/usr/local/mysql/lib/plugin
  --source-keyring=component_keyring_file
  --destination-keyring=component_keyring_encrypted_file
```

If a running server is using the keyring, you must perform an
online migration instead. In this case, the
`--online-migration`
option must be given, along with any connection options
required to specify which server to connect to and the MySQL
account to use.

The following command performs an online migration. It
connects to the local server using a TCP/IP connection and the
`admin` account. The command prompts for a
password, which you should enter when prompted:

```terminal
mysql_migrate_keyring
  --component-dir=/usr/local/mysql/lib/plugin
  --source-keyring=component_keyring_file
  --destination-keyring=component_keyring_encrypted_file
  --online-migration --host=127.0.0.1 --user=admin --password
```

[**mysql\_migrate\_keyring**](mysql-migrate-keyring.md "6.6.8 mysql_migrate_keyring — Keyring Key Migration Utility") performs a migration
operation as follows:

1. (Online migration only) Connect to the running server
   using the connection options.
2. (Online migration only) Disable
   [`keyring_operations`](keyring-system-variables.md#sysvar_keyring_operations) on the
   running server.
3. Load the keyring component libraries for the source and
   destination keystores.
4. Copy keys from the source keystore to the destination.
5. Unload the keyring component libraries for the source and
   destination keystores.
6. (Online migration only) Enable
   [`keyring_operations`](keyring-system-variables.md#sysvar_keyring_operations) on the
   running server.
7. (Online migration only) Disconnect from the running
   server.

If an error occurs during key migration, the destination
keystore is restored to its premigration state.

After a successful online key migration operation, the running
server might need to be restarted:

- If the running server was using the source keystore before
  the migration and should continue to use it after the
  migration, it need not be restarted after the migration.
- If the running server was using the destination keystore
  before the migration and should continue to use it after
  the migration, it should be restarted after the migration
  to load all keys migrated into the destination keystore.
- If the running server was using the source keystore before
  the migration but should use the destination keystore
  after the migration, it must be reconfigured to use the
  destination keystore and restarted. In this case, be aware
  that although the running server is paused from modifying
  the source keystore during the migration itself, it is not
  paused during the interval between the migration and the
  subsequent restart. Care should be taken that the server
  does not modify the source keystore during this interval
  because any such changes will not be reflected in the
  destination keystore.

##### Key Migration Involving Multiple Running Servers

Online key migration provides for pausing keyring operations
on a single running server. To perform a migration if multiple
running servers are using the keystores involved, use this
procedure:

1. Connect to each running server manually and set
   [`keyring_operations=OFF`](keyring-system-variables.md#sysvar_keyring_operations).
   This ensures that no running server is using the source or
   destination keystore and satisfies the required condition
   for offline migration.
2. Use a migration server or
   [**mysql\_migrate\_keyring**](mysql-migrate-keyring.md "6.6.8 mysql_migrate_keyring — Keyring Key Migration Utility") to perform an
   offline key migration for each paused server.
3. Connect to each running server manually and set
   [`keyring_operations=ON`](keyring-system-variables.md#sysvar_keyring_operations).

All running servers must support the
[`keyring_operations`](keyring-system-variables.md#sysvar_keyring_operations) system
variable. Any server that does not must be stopped before the
migration and restarted after.
