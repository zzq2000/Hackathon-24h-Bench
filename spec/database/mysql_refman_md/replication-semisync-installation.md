#### 19.4.10.1 Installing Semisynchronous Replication

Semisynchronous replication is implemented using plugins, which
must be installed on the source and on the replicas to make
semisynchronous replication available on the instances. There
are different plugins for a source and for a replica. After a
plugin has been installed, you control it by means of the system
variables associated with it. These system variables are
available only when the associated plugin has been installed.

This section describes how to install the semisynchronous
replication plugins. For general information about installing
plugins, see [Section 7.6.1, “Installing and Uninstalling Plugins”](plugin-loading.md "7.6.1 Installing and Uninstalling Plugins").

To use semisynchronous replication, the following requirements
must be satisfied:

- The capability of installing plugins requires a MySQL server
  that supports dynamic loading. To verify this, check that
  the value of the
  [`have_dynamic_loading`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_have_dynamic_loading) system
  variable is `YES`. Binary distributions
  should support dynamic loading.
- Replication must already be working, see
  [Section 19.1, “Configuring Replication”](replication-configuration.md "19.1 Configuring Replication").
- There must not be multiple replication channels configured.
  Semisynchronous replication is only compatible with the
  default replication channel. See
  [Section 19.2.2, “Replication Channels”](replication-channels.md "19.2.2 Replication Channels").

MySQL 8.0.26 and later supply new versions of the plugins that
implement semisynchronous replication, one for the source server
and one for the replica. The new plugins replace the terms
“master” and “slave” with
“source” and “replica” in system
variables and status variables, and you can (and should) install
these versions instead of the old ones (which are now
deprecated, and thus subject to removal in a future MySQL
release). You cannot have both the new and the old versions of
the relevant plugin installed on an instance. If you use the new
versions of the plugins, the new system variables and status
variables are available but the old ones are not; if you use the
old versions of the plugins, the old system variables and status
variables are available but the new ones are not.

The file name suffix for the plugin library files differs per
platform (for example, `.so` for Unix and
Unix-like systems, and `.dll` for Windows).
The plugin and library file names are as follows:

- Source server, old terminology:
  `rpl_semi_sync_master` plugin
  (`semisync_master.so` or
  `semisync_master.dll` library)
- Source server, new terminology (from MySQL 8.0.26):
  `rpl_semi_sync_source` plugin
  (`semisync_source.so` or
  `semisync_source.dll` library)
- Replica, old terminology:
  `rpl_semi_sync_slave` plugin
  (`semisync_slave.so` or
  `semisync_slave.dll` library)
- Replica, new terminology (from MySQL 8.0.26):
  `rpl_semi_sync_replica` plugin
  (`semisync_replica.so` or
  `semisync_replica.dll` library)

To be usable by a source or replica server, the appropriate
plugin library file must be located in the MySQL plugin
directory (the directory named by the
[`plugin_dir`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_plugin_dir) system variable). If
necessary, configure the plugin directory location by setting
the value of [`plugin_dir`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_plugin_dir) at
server startup. The source plugin library file must be present
in the plugin directory of the source server. The replica plugin
library file must be present in the plugin directory of each
replica server.

To set up semisynchronous replication, use the following
instructions. The [`INSTALL PLUGIN`](install-plugin.md "15.7.4.4 INSTALL PLUGIN Statement"),
[`SET
GLOBAL`](set-variable.md "15.7.6.1 SET Syntax for Variable Assignment"), [`STOP REPLICA`](stop-replica.md "15.4.2.8 STOP REPLICA Statement"),
and [`START REPLICA`](start-replica.md "15.4.2.6 START REPLICA Statement") statements
mentioned here require the
[`REPLICATION_SLAVE_ADMIN`](privileges-provided.md#priv_replication-slave-admin) privilege
(or the deprecated [`SUPER`](privileges-provided.md#priv_super)
privilege).

To load the plugins, use the [`INSTALL
PLUGIN`](install-plugin.md "15.7.4.4 INSTALL PLUGIN Statement") statement on the source and on each replica
that is to be semisynchronous, adjusting the
`.so` suffix for your platform as necessary.

On the source:

```sql
INSTALL PLUGIN rpl_semi_sync_master SONAME 'semisync_master.so';

Or from MySQL 8.0.26:
INSTALL PLUGIN rpl_semi_sync_source SONAME 'semisync_source.so';
```

On each replica:

```sql
INSTALL PLUGIN rpl_semi_sync_slave SONAME 'semisync_slave.so';

Or from MySQL 8.0.26:
INSTALL PLUGIN rpl_semi_sync_replica SONAME 'semisync_replica.so';
```

If an attempt to install a plugin results in an error on Linux
similar to that shown here, you must install
`libimf`:

```sql
mysql> INSTALL PLUGIN rpl_semi_sync_source SONAME 'semisync_source.so';
ERROR 1126 (HY000): Can't open shared library
'/usr/local/mysql/lib/plugin/semisync_source.so'
(errno: 22 libimf.so: cannot open shared object file:
No such file or directory)
```

You can obtain `libimf` from
<https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/os-linux.html>.

To verify plugin installation, examine the Information Schema
[`PLUGINS`](information-schema-plugins-table.md "28.3.22 The INFORMATION_SCHEMA PLUGINS Table") table or use the
[`SHOW PLUGINS`](show-plugins.md "15.7.7.25 SHOW PLUGINS Statement") statement (see
[Section 7.6.2, “Obtaining Server Plugin Information”](obtaining-plugin-information.md "7.6.2 Obtaining Server Plugin Information")). For example:

```sql
mysql> SELECT PLUGIN_NAME, PLUGIN_STATUS
       FROM INFORMATION_SCHEMA.PLUGINS
       WHERE PLUGIN_NAME LIKE '%semi%';
+----------------------+---------------+
| PLUGIN_NAME          | PLUGIN_STATUS |
+----------------------+---------------+
| rpl_semi_sync_source | ACTIVE        |
+----------------------+---------------+
```

If a plugin fails to initialize, check the server error log for
diagnostic messages.

After a semisynchronous replication plugin has been installed,
it is disabled by default. The plugins must be enabled both on
the source side and the replica side to enable semisynchronous
replication. If only one side is enabled, replication is
asynchronous. To enable the plugins, set the appropriate system
variable either at runtime using
[`SET
GLOBAL`](set-variable.md "15.7.6.1 SET Syntax for Variable Assignment"), or at server startup on the command line or in
an option file. For example:

```sql
On the source:
SET GLOBAL rpl_semi_sync_master_enabled = 1;

Or from MySQL 8.0.26 with the rpl_semi_sync_source plugin:
SET GLOBAL rpl_semi_sync_source_enabled = 1;
```

```sql
On each replica:
SET GLOBAL rpl_semi_sync_slave_enabled = 1;

Or from MySQL 8.0.26 with the rpl_semi_sync_replica plugin:
SET GLOBAL rpl_semi_sync_replica_enabled = 1;
```

If you enable semisynchronous replication on a replica at
runtime, you must also start the replication I/O (receiver)
thread (stopping it first if it is already running) to cause the
replica to connect to the source and register as a
semisynchronous replica:

```sql
STOP SLAVE IO_THREAD;
START SLAVE IO_THREAD;

Or from MySQL 8.0.22:
STOP REPLICA IO_THREAD;
START REPLICA IO_THREAD;
```

If the replication I/O (receiver) thread is already running and
you do not restart it, the replica continues to use asynchronous
replication.

A setting listed in an option file takes effect each time the
server starts. For example, you can set the variables in
`my.cnf` files on the source and replica
servers as follows:

```ini
 On the source:

[mysqld]
rpl_semi_sync_master_enabled=1

Or from MySQL 8.0.26 with the rpl_semi_sync_source plugin:
rpl_semi_sync_source_enabled=1
```

```ini
 On each replica:

[mysqld]
rpl_semi_sync_slave_enabled=1

Or from MySQL 8.0.26 with the rpl_semi_sync_source plugin:
rpl_semi_sync_replica_enabled=1
```

You can configure the behavior of the semisynchronous
replication plugins using the system variables that become
available when you install the plugins. For information on key
system variables, see
[Section 19.4.10.2, “Configuring Semisynchronous Replication”](replication-semisync-interface.md "19.4.10.2 Configuring Semisynchronous Replication").
