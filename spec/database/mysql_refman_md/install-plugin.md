#### 15.7.4.4 INSTALL PLUGIN Statement

```sql
INSTALL PLUGIN plugin_name SONAME 'shared_library_name'
```

This statement installs a server plugin. It requires the
[`INSERT`](privileges-provided.md#priv_insert) privilege for the
`mysql.plugin` system table because it adds a
row to that table to register the plugin.

*`plugin_name`* is the name of the plugin
as defined in the plugin descriptor structure contained in the
library file (see [Plugin Data Structures](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/extending-mysql/8.0/en/plugin-data-structures.html)).
Plugin names are not case-sensitive. For maximal compatibility,
plugin names should be limited to ASCII letters, digits, and
underscore because they are used in C source files, shell
command lines, M4 and Bourne shell scripts, and SQL
environments.

*`shared_library_name`* is the name of
the shared library that contains the plugin code. The name
includes the file name extension (for example,
`libmyplugin.so`,
`libmyplugin.dll`, or
`libmyplugin.dylib`).

The shared library must be located in the plugin directory (the
directory named by the
[`plugin_dir`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_plugin_dir) system variable).
The library must be in the plugin directory itself, not in a
subdirectory. By default,
[`plugin_dir`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_plugin_dir) is the
`plugin` directory under the directory named
by the `pkglibdir` configuration variable, but
it can be changed by setting the value of
[`plugin_dir`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_plugin_dir) at server startup.
For example, set its value in a `my.cnf`
file:

```ini
[mysqld]
plugin_dir=/path/to/plugin/directory
```

If the value of [`plugin_dir`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_plugin_dir) is a
relative path name, it is taken to be relative to the MySQL base
directory (the value of the
[`basedir`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_basedir) system variable).

[`INSTALL PLUGIN`](install-plugin.md "15.7.4.4 INSTALL PLUGIN Statement") loads and
initializes the plugin code to make the plugin available for
use. A plugin is initialized by executing its initialization
function, which handles any setup that the plugin must perform
before it can be used. When the server shuts down, it executes
the deinitialization function for each plugin that is loaded so
that the plugin has a chance to perform any final cleanup.

[`INSTALL PLUGIN`](install-plugin.md "15.7.4.4 INSTALL PLUGIN Statement") also registers the
plugin by adding a line that indicates the plugin name and
library file name to the `mysql.plugin` system
table. During the normal startup sequence, the server loads and
initializes plugins registered in
`mysql.plugin`. This means that a plugin is
installed with [`INSTALL PLUGIN`](install-plugin.md "15.7.4.4 INSTALL PLUGIN Statement")
only once, not every time the server starts. If the server is
started with the
[`--skip-grant-tables`](server-options.md#option_mysqld_skip-grant-tables) option,
plugins registered in the `mysql.plugin` table
are not loaded and are unavailable.

A plugin library can contain multiple plugins. For each of them
to be installed, use a separate [`INSTALL
PLUGIN`](install-plugin.md "15.7.4.4 INSTALL PLUGIN Statement") statement. Each statement names a different
plugin, but all of them specify the same library name.

[`INSTALL PLUGIN`](install-plugin.md "15.7.4.4 INSTALL PLUGIN Statement") causes the server
to read option (`my.cnf`) files just as
during server startup. This enables the plugin to pick up any
relevant options from those files. It is possible to add plugin
options to an option file even before loading a plugin (if the
`loose` prefix is used). It is also possible to
uninstall a plugin, edit `my.cnf`, and
install the plugin again. Restarting the plugin this way enables
it to the new option values without a server restart.

For options that control individual plugin loading at server
startup, see [Section 7.6.1, “Installing and Uninstalling Plugins”](plugin-loading.md "7.6.1 Installing and Uninstalling Plugins"). If you need to
load plugins for a single server startup when the
[`--skip-grant-tables`](server-options.md#option_mysqld_skip-grant-tables) option is
given (which tells the server not to read system tables), use
the [`--plugin-load`](server-options.md#option_mysqld_plugin-load) option. See
[Section 7.1.7, “Server Command Options”](server-options.md "7.1.7 Server Command Options").

To remove a plugin, use the [`UNINSTALL
PLUGIN`](uninstall-plugin.md "15.7.4.6 UNINSTALL PLUGIN Statement") statement.

For additional information about plugin loading, see
[Section 7.6.1, “Installing and Uninstalling Plugins”](plugin-loading.md "7.6.1 Installing and Uninstalling Plugins").

To see what plugins are installed, use the
[`SHOW PLUGINS`](show-plugins.md "15.7.7.25 SHOW PLUGINS Statement") statement or query
the `INFORMATION_SCHEMA` the
[`PLUGINS`](information-schema-plugins-table.md "28.3.22 The INFORMATION_SCHEMA PLUGINS Table") table.

If you recompile a plugin library and need to reinstall it, you
can use either of the following methods:

- Use [`UNINSTALL PLUGIN`](uninstall-plugin.md "15.7.4.6 UNINSTALL PLUGIN Statement") to
  uninstall all plugins in the library, install the new plugin
  library file in the plugin directory, and then use
  [`INSTALL PLUGIN`](install-plugin.md "15.7.4.4 INSTALL PLUGIN Statement") to install all
  plugins in the library. This procedure has the advantage
  that it can be used without stopping the server. However, if
  the plugin library contains many plugins, you must issue
  many [`INSTALL PLUGIN`](install-plugin.md "15.7.4.4 INSTALL PLUGIN Statement") and
  [`UNINSTALL PLUGIN`](uninstall-plugin.md "15.7.4.6 UNINSTALL PLUGIN Statement") statements.
- Stop the server, install the new plugin library file in the
  plugin directory, and restart the server.
