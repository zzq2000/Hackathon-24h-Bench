#### 8.1.2.2 Administrator Guidelines for Password Security

Database administrators should use the following guidelines to
keep passwords secure.

MySQL stores passwords for user accounts in the
`mysql.user` system table. Access to this table
should never be granted to any nonadministrative accounts.

Account passwords can be expired so that users must reset them.
See [Section 8.2.15, “Password Management”](password-management.md "8.2.15 Password Management"), and
[Section 8.2.16, “Server Handling of Expired Passwords”](expired-password-handling.md "8.2.16 Server Handling of Expired Passwords").

The `validate_password` plugin can be used to
enforce a policy on acceptable password. See
[Section 8.4.3, “The Password Validation Component”](validate-password.md "8.4.3 The Password Validation Component").

A user who has access to modify the plugin directory (the value
of the [`plugin_dir`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_plugin_dir) system
variable) or the `my.cnf` file that specifies
the plugin directory location can replace plugins and modify the
capabilities provided by plugins, including authentication
plugins.

Files such as log files to which passwords might be written
should be protected. See [Section 8.1.2.3, “Passwords and Logging”](password-logging.md "8.1.2.3 Passwords and Logging").
