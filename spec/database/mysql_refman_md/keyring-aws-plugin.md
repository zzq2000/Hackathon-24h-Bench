#### 8.4.4.9 Using the keyring\_aws Amazon Web Services Keyring Plugin

Note

The `keyring_aws` plugin is an extension
included in MySQL Enterprise Edition, a commercial product. To learn more about
commercial products, see <https://www.mysql.com/products/>.

The `keyring_aws` keyring plugin communicates
with the Amazon Web Services Key Management Service (AWS KMS) as
a back end for key generation and uses a local file for key
storage. All keyring material is generated exclusively by the
AWS server, not by `keyring_aws`.

MySQL Enterprise Edition can work with `keyring_aws` on Red Hat
Enterprise Linux, SUSE Linux Enterprise Server, Debian, Ubuntu,
macOS, and Windows. MySQL Enterprise Edition does not support the use of
`keyring_aws` on these platforms:

- EL6
- Generic Linux (glibc2.12)
- SLES 12 (with versions after MySQL Server 5.7)
- Solaris

The discussion here assumes that you are familiar with AWS in
general and KMS in particular. Some pertinent information
sources:

- [AWS site](https://aws.amazon.com/kms/)
- [KMS
  documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/)

The following sections provide configuration and usage
information for the `keyring_aws` keyring
plugin:

- [keyring\_aws Configuration](keyring-aws-plugin.md#keyring-aws-plugin-configuration "keyring_aws Configuration")
- [keyring\_aws Operation](keyring-aws-plugin.md#keyring-aws-plugin-operation "keyring_aws Operation")
- [keyring\_aws Credential Changes](keyring-aws-plugin.md#keyring-aws-plugin-credential-changes "keyring_aws Credential Changes")

##### keyring\_aws Configuration

To install `keyring_aws`, use the general
instructions found in
[Section 8.4.4.3, “Keyring Plugin Installation”](keyring-plugin-installation.md "8.4.4.3 Keyring Plugin Installation"), together with
the plugin-specific configuration information found here.

The plugin library file contains the
`keyring_aws` plugin and two loadable
functions,
[`keyring_aws_rotate_cmk()`](keyring-functions-plugin-specific.md#function_keyring-aws-rotate-cmk) and
[`keyring_aws_rotate_keys()`](keyring-functions-plugin-specific.md#function_keyring-aws-rotate-keys).

To configure `keyring_aws`, you must obtain a
secret access key that provides credentials for communicating
with AWS KMS and write it to a configuration file:

1. Create an AWS KMS account.
2. Use AWS KMS to create a secret access key ID and secret
   access key. The access key serves to verify your identity
   and that of your applications.
3. Use the AWS KMS account to create a KMS key ID. At MySQL
   startup, set the
   [`keyring_aws_cmk_id`](keyring-system-variables.md#sysvar_keyring_aws_cmk_id) system
   variable to the CMK ID value. This variable is mandatory
   and there is no default. (Its value can be changed at
   runtime if desired using
   [`SET
   GLOBAL`](set-variable.md "15.7.6.1 SET Syntax for Variable Assignment").)
4. If necessary, create the directory in which the
   configuration file should be located. The directory should
   have a restrictive mode and be accessible only to the
   account used to run the MySQL server. For example, on many
   Unix and Unix-like systems, such as Oracle Enterprise
   Linux, to use
   `/usr/local/mysql/mysql-keyring/keyring_aws_conf`
   as the file name, the following commands (executed as
   `root`) create its parent directory and
   set the directory mode and ownership:

   ```terminal
   $> cd /usr/local/mysql
   $> mkdir mysql-keyring
   $> chmod 750 mysql-keyring
   $> chown mysql mysql-keyring
   $> chgrp mysql mysql-keyring
   ```

   At MySQL startup, set the
   [`keyring_aws_conf_file`](keyring-system-variables.md#sysvar_keyring_aws_conf_file)
   system variable to
   `/usr/local/mysql/mysql-keyring/keyring_aws_conf`
   to indicate the configuration file location to the server.

   The location of the configuration file may vary according
   to Linux distribution; the directory for this file may
   also already be provided by a system module or other
   application such as AppArmor. For example, under AppArmor
   on recent editions of Ubuntu Linux, the keyring directory
   is specified as
   `/var/lib/mysql-keyring`. See
   [Ubuntu
   Server: AppArmor](https://documentation.ubuntu.com/server/how-to/security/apparmor/index.html) for more information about using
   AppArmor on Ubuntu systems; see also
   [this
   example MySQL configuration file](https://exampleconfig.com/view/mysql-ubuntu20-04-etc-apparmor-d-usr-sbin-mysqld). For other
   operating platforms, see the system documentation for
   guidance.
5. Prepare the `keyring_aws` configuration
   file, which should contain two lines:

   - Line 1: The secret access key ID
   - Line 2: The secret access key

   For example, if the key ID is
   `wwwwwwwwwwwwwEXAMPLE` and the key is
   `xxxxxxxxxxxxx/yyyyyyy/zzzzzzzzEXAMPLEKEY`,
   the configuration file looks like this:

   ```none
   wwwwwwwwwwwwwEXAMPLE
   xxxxxxxxxxxxx/yyyyyyy/zzzzzzzzEXAMPLEKEY
   ```

To be usable during the server startup process,
`keyring_aws` must be loaded using the
[`--early-plugin-load`](server-options.md#option_mysqld_early-plugin-load) option. The
[`keyring_aws_cmk_id`](keyring-system-variables.md#sysvar_keyring_aws_cmk_id) system
variable is mandatory and configures the KMS key ID obtained
from the AWS KMS server. The
[`keyring_aws_conf_file`](keyring-system-variables.md#sysvar_keyring_aws_conf_file) and
[`keyring_aws_data_file`](keyring-system-variables.md#sysvar_keyring_aws_data_file) system
variables optionally configure the locations of the files used
by the `keyring_aws` plugin for configuration
information and data storage. The file location variable
default values are platform specific. To configure the
locations explicitly, set the variable values at startup. For
example, use these lines in the server
`my.cnf` file, adjusting the
`.so` suffix and file locations for your
platform as necessary:

```ini
[mysqld]
early-plugin-load=keyring_aws.so
keyring_aws_cmk_id='arn:aws:kms:us-west-2:111122223333:key/abcd1234-ef56-ab12-cd34-ef56abcd1234'
keyring_aws_conf_file=/usr/local/mysql/mysql-keyring/keyring_aws_conf
keyring_aws_data_file=/usr/local/mysql/mysql-keyring/keyring_aws_data
```

For the `keyring_aws` plugin to start
successfully, the configuration file must exist and contain
valid secret access key information, initialized as described
previously. The storage file need not exist. If it does not,
`keyring_aws` attempts to create it (as well
as its parent directory, if necessary).

Important

The default AWS region is `us-east-1`. For
any other region, you must also set
[`keyring_aws_region`](keyring-system-variables.md#sysvar_keyring_aws_region)
explicitly in `my.cnf`.

For additional information about the system variables used to
configure the `keyring_aws` plugin, see
[Section 8.4.4.19, “Keyring System Variables”](keyring-system-variables.md "8.4.4.19 Keyring System Variables").

Start the MySQL server and install the functions associated
with the `keyring_aws` plugin. This is a
one-time operation, performed by executing the following
statements, adjusting the `.so` suffix for
your platform as necessary:

```sql
CREATE FUNCTION keyring_aws_rotate_cmk RETURNS INTEGER
  SONAME 'keyring_aws.so';
CREATE FUNCTION keyring_aws_rotate_keys RETURNS INTEGER
  SONAME 'keyring_aws.so';
```

For additional information about the
`keyring_aws` functions, see
[Section 8.4.4.16, “Plugin-Specific Keyring Key-Management Functions”](keyring-functions-plugin-specific.md "8.4.4.16 Plugin-Specific Keyring Key-Management Functions").

##### keyring\_aws Operation

At plugin startup, the `keyring_aws` plugin
reads the AWS secret access key ID and key from its
configuration file. It also reads any encrypted keys contained
in its storage file into its in-memory cache.

During operation, `keyring_aws` maintains
encrypted keys in the in-memory cache and uses the storage
file as local persistent storage. Each keyring operation is
transactional: `keyring_aws` either
successfully changes both the in-memory key cache and the
keyring storage file, or the operation fails and the keyring
state remains unchanged.

To ensure that keys are flushed only when the correct keyring
storage file exists, `keyring_aws` stores a
SHA-256 checksum of the keyring in the file. Before updating
the file, the plugin verifies that it contains the expected
checksum.

The `keyring_aws` plugin supports the
functions that comprise the standard MySQL Keyring service
interface. Keyring operations performed by these functions are
accessible at two levels:

- SQL interface: In SQL statements, call the functions
  described in
  [Section 8.4.4.15, “General-Purpose Keyring Key-Management Functions”](keyring-functions-general-purpose.md "8.4.4.15 General-Purpose Keyring Key-Management Functions").
- C interface: In C-language code, call the keyring service
  functions described in [Section 7.6.9.2, “The Keyring Service”](keyring-service.md "7.6.9.2 The Keyring Service").

Example (using the SQL interface):

```sql
SELECT keyring_key_generate('MyKey', 'AES', 32);
SELECT keyring_key_remove('MyKey');
```

In addition, the
[`keyring_aws_rotate_cmk()`](keyring-functions-plugin-specific.md#function_keyring-aws-rotate-cmk) and
[`keyring_aws_rotate_keys()`](keyring-functions-plugin-specific.md#function_keyring-aws-rotate-keys)
functions “extend” the keyring plugin interface
to provide AWS-related capabilities not covered by the
standard keyring service interface. These capabilities are
accessible only by calling these functions using SQL. There
are no corresponding C-language key service functions.

For information about the characteristics of key values
permitted by `keyring_aws`, see
[Section 8.4.4.13, “Supported Keyring Key Types and Lengths”](keyring-key-types.md "8.4.4.13 Supported Keyring Key Types and Lengths").

##### keyring\_aws Credential Changes

Assuming that the `keyring_aws` plugin has
initialized properly at server startup, it is possible to
change the credentials used for communicating with AWS KMS:

1. Use AWS KMS to create a new secret access key ID and
   secret access key.
2. Store the new credentials in the configuration file (the
   file named by the
   [`keyring_aws_conf_file`](keyring-system-variables.md#sysvar_keyring_aws_conf_file)
   system variable). The file format is as described
   previously.
3. Reinitialize the `keyring_aws` plugin so
   that it re-reads the configuration file. Assuming that the
   new credentials are valid, the plugin should initialize
   successfully.

   There are two ways to reinitialize the plugin:

   - Restart the server. This is simpler and has no side
     effects, but is not suitable for installations that
     require minimal server downtime with as few restarts
     as possible.
   - Reinitialize the plugin without restarting the server
     by executing the following statements, adjusting the
     `.so` suffix for your platform as
     necessary:

     ```sql
     UNINSTALL PLUGIN keyring_aws;
     INSTALL PLUGIN keyring_aws SONAME 'keyring_aws.so';
     ```

     Note

     In addition to loading a plugin at runtime,
     [`INSTALL PLUGIN`](install-plugin.md "15.7.4.4 INSTALL PLUGIN Statement") has
     the side effect of registering the plugin it in the
     `mysql.plugin` system table.
     Because of this, if you decide to stop using
     `keyring_aws`, it is not sufficient
     to remove the
     [`--early-plugin-load`](server-options.md#option_mysqld_early-plugin-load)
     option from the set of options used to start the
     server. That stops the plugin from loading early,
     but the server still attempts to load it when it
     gets to the point in the startup sequence where it
     loads the plugins registered in
     `mysql.plugin`.

     Consequently, if you execute the
     [`UNINSTALL PLUGIN`](uninstall-plugin.md "15.7.4.6 UNINSTALL PLUGIN Statement") plus
     [`INSTALL PLUGIN`](install-plugin.md "15.7.4.4 INSTALL PLUGIN Statement")
     sequence just described to change the AWS KMS
     credentials, then to stop using
     `keyring_aws`, it is necessary to
     execute [`UNINSTALL
     PLUGIN`](uninstall-plugin.md "15.7.4.6 UNINSTALL PLUGIN Statement") again to unregister the plugin in
     addition to removing the
     [`--early-plugin-load`](server-options.md#option_mysqld_early-plugin-load)
     option.
