#### 25.2.7.8 Issues Exclusive to NDB Cluster

The following are limitations specific to the
[`NDB`](mysql-cluster.md "Chapter 25 MySQL NDB Cluster 8.0") storage engine:

- **Machine architecture.**
  All machines used in the cluster must have the same
  architecture. That is, all machines hosting nodes must be
  either big-endian or little-endian, and you cannot use a
  mixture of both. For example, you cannot have a management
  node running on a PowerPC which directs a data node that
  is running on an x86 machine. This restriction does not
  apply to machines simply running [**mysql**](mysql.md "6.5.1 mysql — The MySQL Command-Line Client")
  or other clients that may be accessing the cluster's
  SQL nodes.
- **Binary logging.**
  NDB Cluster has the following limitations or restrictions
  with regard to binary logging:

  - NDB Cluster cannot produce a binary log for tables
    having [`BLOB`](blob.md "13.3.4 The BLOB and TEXT Types") columns but
    no primary key.
  - Only the following schema operations are logged in a
    cluster binary log which is *not* on
    the [**mysqld**](mysqld.md "6.3.1 mysqld — The MySQL Server") executing the statement:

    - [`CREATE TABLE`](create-table.md "15.1.20 CREATE TABLE Statement")
    - [`ALTER TABLE`](alter-table.md "15.1.9 ALTER TABLE Statement")
    - [`DROP TABLE`](drop-table.md "15.1.32 DROP TABLE Statement")
    - [`CREATE DATABASE`](create-database.md "15.1.12 CREATE DATABASE Statement") /
      [`CREATE
      SCHEMA`](create-database.md "15.1.12 CREATE DATABASE Statement")
    - [`DROP DATABASE`](drop-database.md "15.1.24 DROP DATABASE Statement") /
      [`DROP
      SCHEMA`](drop-database.md "15.1.24 DROP DATABASE Statement")
    - [`CREATE TABLESPACE`](create-tablespace.md "15.1.21 CREATE TABLESPACE Statement")
    - [`ALTER TABLESPACE`](alter-tablespace.md "15.1.10 ALTER TABLESPACE Statement")
    - [`DROP TABLESPACE`](drop-tablespace.md "15.1.33 DROP TABLESPACE Statement")
    - [`CREATE LOGFILE GROUP`](create-logfile-group.md "15.1.16 CREATE LOGFILE GROUP Statement")
    - [`ALTER LOGFILE GROUP`](alter-logfile-group.md "15.1.6 ALTER LOGFILE GROUP Statement")
    - [`DROP LOGFILE GROUP`](drop-logfile-group.md "15.1.28 DROP LOGFILE GROUP Statement")
- **Schema operations.**
  Schema operations (DDL statements) are rejected while any
  data node restarts. Schema operations are also not
  supported while performing an online upgrade or downgrade.
- **Number of fragment replicas.**
  The number of fragment replicas, as determined by the
  [`NoOfReplicas`](mysql-cluster-ndbd-definition.md#ndbparam-ndbd-noofreplicas) data
  node configuration parameter, is the number of copies of
  all data stored by NDB Cluster. Setting this parameter to
  1 means there is only a single copy; in this case, no
  redundancy is provided, and the loss of a data node
  entails loss of data. To guarantee redundancy, and thus
  preservation of data even if a data node fails, set this
  parameter to 2, which is the default and recommended value
  in production.

  Setting [`NoOfReplicas`](mysql-cluster-ndbd-definition.md#ndbparam-ndbd-noofreplicas)
  to a value greater than 2 is supported (to a maximum of 4)
  but unnecessary to guard against loss of data.
