#### 29.12.3.2 The file\_instances Table

The [`file_instances`](performance-schema-file-instances-table.md "29.12.3.2 The file_instances Table") table lists
all the files seen by the Performance Schema when executing
file I/O instrumentation. If a file on disk has never been
opened, it is not shown in
[`file_instances`](performance-schema-file-instances-table.md "29.12.3.2 The file_instances Table"). When a file is
deleted from the disk, it is also removed from the
[`file_instances`](performance-schema-file-instances-table.md "29.12.3.2 The file_instances Table") table.

The [`file_instances`](performance-schema-file-instances-table.md "29.12.3.2 The file_instances Table") table has
these columns:

- `FILE_NAME`

  The file name.
- `EVENT_NAME`

  The instrument name associated with the file.
- `OPEN_COUNT`

  The count of open handles on the file. If a file was
  opened and then closed, it was opened 1 time, but
  `OPEN_COUNT` is 0. To list all the files
  currently opened by the server, use `WHERE
  OPEN_COUNT > 0`.

The [`file_instances`](performance-schema-file-instances-table.md "29.12.3.2 The file_instances Table") table has
these indexes:

- Primary key on (`FILE_NAME`)
- Index on (`EVENT_NAME`)

[`TRUNCATE TABLE`](truncate-table.md "15.1.37 TRUNCATE TABLE Statement") is not permitted
for the [`file_instances`](performance-schema-file-instances-table.md "29.12.3.2 The file_instances Table") table.
