#### 10.4.3.1 How MySQL Opens and Closes Tables

When you execute a [**mysqladmin status**](mysqladmin.md "6.5.2 mysqladmin — A MySQL Server Administration Program")
command, you should see something like this:

```none
Uptime: 426 Running threads: 1 Questions: 11082
Reloads: 1 Open tables: 12
```

The `Open tables` value of 12 can be somewhat
puzzling if you have fewer than 12 tables.

MySQL is multithreaded, so there may be many clients issuing
queries for a given table simultaneously. To minimize the
problem with multiple client sessions having different states
on the same table, the table is opened independently by each
concurrent session. This uses additional memory but normally
increases performance. With `MyISAM` tables,
one extra file descriptor is required for the data file for
each client that has the table open. (By contrast, the index
file descriptor is shared between all sessions.)

The [`table_open_cache`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_table_open_cache) and
[`max_connections`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_max_connections) system
variables affect the maximum number of files the server keeps
open. If you increase one or both of these values, you may run
up against a limit imposed by your operating system on the
per-process number of open file descriptors. Many operating
systems permit you to increase the open-files limit, although
the method varies widely from system to system. Consult your
operating system documentation to determine whether it is
possible to increase the limit and how to do so.

[`table_open_cache`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_table_open_cache) is related
to [`max_connections`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_max_connections). For
example, for 200 concurrent running connections, specify a
table cache size of at least `200 *
N`, where
*`N`* is the maximum number of tables
per join in any of the queries which you execute. You must
also reserve some extra file descriptors for temporary tables
and files.

Make sure that your operating system can handle the number of
open file descriptors implied by the
[`table_open_cache`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_table_open_cache) setting. If
[`table_open_cache`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_table_open_cache) is set too
high, MySQL may run out of file descriptors and exhibit
symptoms such as refusing connections or failing to perform
queries.

Also take into account that the `MyISAM`
storage engine needs two file descriptors for each unique open
table. To increase the number of file descriptors available to
MySQL, set the
[`open_files_limit`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_open_files_limit) system
variable. See [Section B.3.2.16, “File Not Found and Similar Errors”](not-enough-file-handles.md "B.3.2.16 File Not Found and Similar Errors").

The cache of open tables is kept at a level of
[`table_open_cache`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_table_open_cache) entries. The
server autosizes the cache size at startup. To set the size
explicitly, set the
[`table_open_cache`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_table_open_cache) system
variable at startup. MySQL may temporarily open more tables
than this to execute queries, as described later in this
section.

MySQL closes an unused table and removes it from the table
cache under the following circumstances:

- When the cache is full and a thread tries to open a table
  that is not in the cache.
- When the cache contains more than
  [`table_open_cache`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_table_open_cache) entries
  and a table in the cache is no longer being used by any
  threads.
- When a table-flushing operation occurs. This happens when
  someone issues a [`FLUSH
  TABLES`](flush.md#flush-tables) statement or executes a
  [**mysqladmin flush-tables**](mysqladmin.md "6.5.2 mysqladmin — A MySQL Server Administration Program") or
  [**mysqladmin refresh**](mysqladmin.md "6.5.2 mysqladmin — A MySQL Server Administration Program") command.

When the table cache fills up, the server uses the following
procedure to locate a cache entry to use:

- Tables not currently in use are released, beginning with
  the table least recently used.
- If a new table must be opened, but the cache is full and
  no tables can be released, the cache is temporarily
  extended as necessary. When the cache is in a temporarily
  extended state and a table goes from a used to unused
  state, the table is closed and released from the cache.

A `MyISAM` table is opened for each
concurrent access. This means the table needs to be opened
twice if two threads access the same table or if a thread
accesses the table twice in the same query (for example, by
joining the table to itself). Each concurrent open requires an
entry in the table cache. The first open of any
`MyISAM` table takes two file descriptors:
one for the data file and one for the index file. Each
additional use of the table takes only one file descriptor for
the data file. The index file descriptor is shared among all
threads.

If you are opening a table with the `HANDLER
tbl_name OPEN` statement,
a dedicated table object is allocated for the thread. This
table object is not shared by other threads and is not closed
until the thread calls `HANDLER
tbl_name CLOSE` or the
thread terminates. When this happens, the table is put back in
the table cache (if the cache is not full). See
[Section 15.2.5, “HANDLER Statement”](handler.md "15.2.5 HANDLER Statement").

To determine whether your table cache is too small, check the
[`Opened_tables`](server-status-variables.md#statvar_Opened_tables) status
variable, which indicates the number of table-opening
operations since the server started:

```sql
mysql> SHOW GLOBAL STATUS LIKE 'Opened_tables';
+---------------+-------+
| Variable_name | Value |
+---------------+-------+
| Opened_tables | 2741  |
+---------------+-------+
```

If the value is very large or increases rapidly, even when you
have not issued many [`FLUSH
TABLES`](flush.md#flush-tables) statements, increase the
[`table_open_cache`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_table_open_cache) value at
server startup.
