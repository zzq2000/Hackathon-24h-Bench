### 10.15.14 Preventing the Use of Optimizer Trace

If, for some reason, you wish to prevent users from seeing traces
of their queries, start the server with the options shown here:

```terminal
--maximum-optimizer-trace-max-mem-size=0 --optimizer-trace-max-mem-size=0
```

This sets the maximum size to 0 and prevents users from changing
this limit, thus truncating all traces to 0 bytes.
