#### 10.2.1.16 ORDER BY Optimization

This section describes when MySQL can use an index to satisfy
an `ORDER BY` clause, the
`filesort` operation used when an index
cannot be used, and execution plan information available from
the optimizer about `ORDER BY`.

An `ORDER BY` with and without
`LIMIT` may return rows in different orders,
as discussed in [Section 10.2.1.19, “LIMIT Query Optimization”](limit-optimization.md "10.2.1.19 LIMIT Query Optimization").

##### Use of Indexes to Satisfy ORDER BY

In some cases, MySQL may use an index to satisfy an
`ORDER BY` clause and avoid the extra
sorting involved in performing a `filesort`
operation.

The index may also be used even if the `ORDER
BY` does not match the index exactly, as long as
all unused portions of the index and all extra
`ORDER BY` columns are constants in the
`WHERE` clause. If the index does not
contain all columns accessed by the query, the index is used
only if index access is cheaper than other access methods.

Assuming that there is an index on
`(key_part1,
key_part2)`, the
following queries may use the index to resolve the
`ORDER BY` part. Whether the optimizer
actually does so depends on whether reading the index is
more efficient than a table scan if columns not in the index
must also be read.

- In this query, the index on
  `(key_part1,
  key_part2)` enables
  the optimizer to avoid sorting:

  ```sql
  SELECT * FROM t1
    ORDER BY key_part1, key_part2;
  ```

  However, the query uses `SELECT *`,
  which may select more columns than
  *`key_part1`* and
  *`key_part2`*. In that case,
  scanning an entire index and looking up table rows to
  find columns not in the index may be more expensive than
  scanning the table and sorting the results. If so, the
  optimizer probably does not use the index. If
  `SELECT *` selects only the index
  columns, the index is used and sorting avoided.

  If `t1` is an `InnoDB`
  table, the table primary key is implicitly part of the
  index, and the index can be used to resolve the
  `ORDER BY` for this query:

  ```sql
  SELECT pk, key_part1, key_part2 FROM t1
    ORDER BY key_part1, key_part2;
  ```
- In this query, *`key_part1`* is
  constant, so all rows accessed through the index are in
  *`key_part2`* order, and an index
  on `(key_part1,
  key_part2)` avoids
  sorting if the `WHERE` clause is
  selective enough to make an index range scan cheaper
  than a table scan:

  ```sql
  SELECT * FROM t1
    WHERE key_part1 = constant
    ORDER BY key_part2;
  ```
- In the next two queries, whether the index is used is
  similar to the same queries without
  `DESC` shown previously:

  ```sql
  SELECT * FROM t1
    ORDER BY key_part1 DESC, key_part2 DESC;

  SELECT * FROM t1
    WHERE key_part1 = constant
    ORDER BY key_part2 DESC;
  ```
- Two columns in an `ORDER BY` can sort
  in the same direction (both `ASC`, or
  both `DESC`) or in opposite directions
  (one `ASC`, one
  `DESC`). A condition for index use is
  that the index must have the same homogeneity, but need
  not have the same actual direction.

  If a query mixes `ASC` and
  `DESC`, the optimizer can use an index
  on the columns if the index also uses corresponding
  mixed ascending and descending columns:

  ```sql
  SELECT * FROM t1
    ORDER BY key_part1 DESC, key_part2 ASC;
  ```

  The optimizer can use an index on
  (*`key_part1`*,
  *`key_part2`*) if
  *`key_part1`* is descending and
  *`key_part2`* is ascending. It
  can also use an index on those columns (with a backward
  scan) if *`key_part1`* is
  ascending and *`key_part2`* is
  descending. See [Section 10.3.13, “Descending Indexes”](descending-indexes.md "10.3.13 Descending Indexes").
- In the next two queries,
  *`key_part1`* is compared to a
  constant. The index is used if the
  `WHERE` clause is selective enough to
  make an index range scan cheaper than a table scan:

  ```sql
  SELECT * FROM t1
    WHERE key_part1 > constant
    ORDER BY key_part1 ASC;

  SELECT * FROM t1
    WHERE key_part1 < constant
    ORDER BY key_part1 DESC;
  ```
- In the next query, the `ORDER BY` does
  not name *`key_part1`*, but all
  rows selected have a constant
  *`key_part1`* value, so the index
  can still be used:

  ```sql
  SELECT * FROM t1
    WHERE key_part1 = constant1 AND key_part2 > constant2
    ORDER BY key_part2;
  ```

In some cases, MySQL *cannot* use indexes
to resolve the `ORDER BY`, although it may
still use indexes to find the rows that match the
`WHERE` clause. Examples:

- The query uses `ORDER BY` on different
  indexes:

  ```sql
  SELECT * FROM t1 ORDER BY key1, key2;
  ```
- The query uses `ORDER BY` on
  nonconsecutive parts of an index:

  ```sql
  SELECT * FROM t1 WHERE key2=constant ORDER BY key1_part1, key1_part3;
  ```
- The index used to fetch the rows differs from the one
  used in the `ORDER BY`:

  ```sql
  SELECT * FROM t1 WHERE key2=constant ORDER BY key1;
  ```
- The query uses `ORDER BY` with an
  expression that includes terms other than the index
  column name:

  ```sql
  SELECT * FROM t1 ORDER BY ABS(key);
  SELECT * FROM t1 ORDER BY -key;
  ```
- The query joins many tables, and the columns in the
  `ORDER BY` are not all from the first
  nonconstant table that is used to retrieve rows. (This
  is the first table in the
  [`EXPLAIN`](explain.md "15.8.2 EXPLAIN Statement") output that does
  not have a [`const`](explain-output.md#jointype_const) join
  type.)
- The query has different `ORDER BY` and
  `GROUP BY` expressions.
- There is an index on only a prefix of a column named in
  the `ORDER BY` clause. In this case,
  the index cannot be used to fully resolve the sort
  order. For example, if only the first 10 bytes of a
  [`CHAR(20)`](char.md "13.3.2 The CHAR and VARCHAR Types") column are
  indexed, the index cannot distinguish values past the
  10th byte and a `filesort` is needed.
- The index does not store rows in order. For example,
  this is true for a `HASH` index in a
  `MEMORY` table.

Availability of an index for sorting may be affected by the
use of column aliases. Suppose that the column
`t1.a` is indexed. In this statement, the
name of the column in the select list is
`a`. It refers to `t1.a`,
as does the reference to `a` in the
`ORDER BY`, so the index on
`t1.a` can be used:

```sql
SELECT a FROM t1 ORDER BY a;
```

In this statement, the name of the column in the select list
is also `a`, but it is the alias name. It
refers to `ABS(a)`, as does the reference
to `a` in the `ORDER BY`,
so the index on `t1.a` cannot be used:

```sql
SELECT ABS(a) AS a FROM t1 ORDER BY a;
```

In the following statement, the `ORDER BY`
refers to a name that is not the name of a column in the
select list. But there is a column in `t1`
named `a`, so the `ORDER
BY` refers to `t1.a` and the index
on `t1.a` can be used. (The resulting sort
order may be completely different from the order for
`ABS(a)`, of course.)

```sql
SELECT ABS(a) AS b FROM t1 ORDER BY a;
```

Previously (MySQL 5.7 and lower),
`GROUP BY` sorted implicitly under certain
conditions. In MySQL 8.0, that no longer
occurs, so specifying `ORDER BY NULL` at
the end to suppress implicit sorting (as was done
previously) is no longer necessary. However, query results
may differ from previous MySQL versions. To produce a given
sort order, provide an `ORDER BY` clause.

##### Use of filesort to Satisfy ORDER BY

If an index cannot be used to satisfy an `ORDER
BY` clause, MySQL performs a
`filesort` operation that reads table rows
and sorts them. A `filesort` constitutes an
extra sorting phase in query execution.

To obtain memory for `filesort` operations,
as of MySQL 8.0.12, the optimizer allocates memory buffers
incrementally as needed, up to the size indicated by the
[`sort_buffer_size`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_sort_buffer_size) system
variable, rather than allocating a fixed amount of
[`sort_buffer_size`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_sort_buffer_size) bytes up
front, as was done prior to MySQL 8.0.12. This enables users
to set [`sort_buffer_size`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_sort_buffer_size) to
larger values to speed up larger sorts, without concern for
excessive memory use for small sorts. (This benefit may not
occur for multiple concurrent sorts on Windows, which has a
weak multithreaded `malloc`.)

A `filesort` operation uses temporary disk
files as necessary if the result set is too large to fit in
memory. Some types of queries are particularly suited to
completely in-memory `filesort` operations.
For example, the optimizer can use
`filesort` to efficiently handle in memory,
without temporary files, the `ORDER BY`
operation for queries (and subqueries) of the following
form:

```sql
SELECT ... FROM single_table ... ORDER BY non_index_column [DESC] LIMIT [M,]N;
```

Such queries are common in web applications that display
only a few rows from a larger result set. Examples:

```sql
SELECT col1, ... FROM t1 ... ORDER BY name LIMIT 10;
SELECT col1, ... FROM t1 ... ORDER BY RAND() LIMIT 15;
```

##### Influencing ORDER BY Optimization

For slow `ORDER BY` queries for which
`filesort` is not used, try lowering the
[`max_length_for_sort_data`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_max_length_for_sort_data)
system variable to a value that is appropriate to trigger a
`filesort`. (A symptom of setting the value
of this variable too high is a combination of high disk
activity and low CPU activity.) This technique applies only
before MySQL 8.0.20. As of 8.0.20,
[`max_length_for_sort_data`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_max_length_for_sort_data) is
deprecated due to optimizer changes that make it obsolete
and of no effect.

To increase `ORDER BY` speed, check whether
you can get MySQL to use indexes rather than an extra
sorting phase. If this is not possible, try the following
strategies:

- Increase the
  [`sort_buffer_size`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_sort_buffer_size)
  variable value. Ideally, the value should be large
  enough for the entire result set to fit in the sort
  buffer (to avoid writes to disk and merge passes).

  Take into account that the size of column values stored
  in the sort buffer is affected by the
  [`max_sort_length`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_max_sort_length) system
  variable value. For example, if tuples store values of
  long string columns and you increase the value of
  [`max_sort_length`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_max_sort_length), the
  size of sort buffer tuples increases as well and may
  require you to increase
  [`sort_buffer_size`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_sort_buffer_size).

  To monitor the number of merge passes (to merge
  temporary files), check the
  [`Sort_merge_passes`](server-status-variables.md#statvar_Sort_merge_passes)
  status variable.
- Increase the
  [`read_rnd_buffer_size`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_read_rnd_buffer_size)
  variable value so that more rows are read at a time.
- Change the [`tmpdir`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_tmpdir)
  system variable to point to a dedicated file system with
  large amounts of free space. The variable value can list
  several paths that are used in round-robin fashion; you
  can use this feature to spread the load across several
  directories. Separate the paths by colon characters
  (`:`) on Unix and semicolon characters
  (`;`) on Windows. The paths should name
  directories in file systems located on different
  *physical* disks, not different
  partitions on the same disk.

##### ORDER BY Execution Plan Information Available

With
[`EXPLAIN`](explain.md "15.8.2 EXPLAIN Statement")
(see [Section 10.8.1, “Optimizing Queries with EXPLAIN”](using-explain.md "10.8.1 Optimizing Queries with EXPLAIN")), you can check whether
MySQL can use indexes to resolve an `ORDER
BY` clause:

- If the `Extra` column of
  [`EXPLAIN`](explain.md "15.8.2 EXPLAIN Statement") output does not
  contain `Using filesort`, the index is
  used and a `filesort` is not performed.
- If the `Extra` column of
  [`EXPLAIN`](explain.md "15.8.2 EXPLAIN Statement") output contains
  `Using filesort`, the index is not used
  and a `filesort` is performed.

In addition, if a `filesort` is performed,
optimizer trace output includes a
`filesort_summary` block. For example:

```json
"filesort_summary": {
  "rows": 100,
  "examined_rows": 100,
  "number_of_tmp_files": 0,
  "peak_memory_used": 25192,
  "sort_mode": "<sort_key, packed_additional_fields>"
}
```

`peak_memory_used` indicates the maximum
memory used at any one time during the sort. This is a value
up to but not necessarily as large as the value of the
[`sort_buffer_size`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_sort_buffer_size) system
variable. Prior to MySQL 8.0.12, the output shows
`sort_buffer_size` instead, indicating the
value of [`sort_buffer_size`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_sort_buffer_size).
(Prior to MySQL 8.0.12, the optimizer always allocates
[`sort_buffer_size`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_sort_buffer_size) bytes for
the sort buffer. As of 8.0.12, the optimizer allocates
sort-buffer memory incrementally, beginning with a small
amount and adding more as necessary, up to
[`sort_buffer_size`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_sort_buffer_size) bytes.)

The `sort_mode` value provides information
about the contents of tuples in the sort buffer:

- `<sort_key, rowid>`: This
  indicates that sort buffer tuples are pairs that contain
  the sort key value and row ID of the original table row.
  Tuples are sorted by sort key value and the row ID is
  used to read the row from the table.
- `<sort_key, additional_fields>`:
  This indicates that sort buffer tuples contain the sort
  key value and columns referenced by the query. Tuples
  are sorted by sort key value and column values are read
  directly from the tuple.
- `<sort_key,
  packed_additional_fields>`: Like the
  previous variant, but the additional columns are packed
  tightly together instead of using a fixed-length
  encoding.

[`EXPLAIN`](explain.md "15.8.2 EXPLAIN Statement") does not distinguish
whether the optimizer does or does not perform a
`filesort` in memory. Use of an in-memory
`filesort` can be seen in optimizer trace
output. Look for
`filesort_priority_queue_optimization`. For
information about the optimizer trace, see
[Section 10.15, “Tracing the Optimizer”](optimizer-tracing.md "10.15 Tracing the Optimizer").
