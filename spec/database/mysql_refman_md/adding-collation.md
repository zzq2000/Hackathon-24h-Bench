## 12.14 Adding a Collation to a Character Set

[12.14.3 Adding a Simple Collation to an 8-Bit Character Set](adding-collation-simple-8bit.md)

Warning

User-defined collations are deprecated; you should expect
support for them to be removed in a future version of MySQL. As
of MySQL 8.0.33, the server issues a warning for any use of
`COLLATE
user_defined_collation` in
an SQL statement; a warning is also issued when the server is
started with [`--collation-server`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_collation_server)
set equal to the name of a user-defined collation.

A collation is a set of rules that defines how to compare and sort
character strings. Each collation in MySQL belongs to a single
character set. Every character set has at least one collation, and
most have two or more collations.

A collation orders characters based on weights. Each character in
a character set maps to a weight. Characters with equal weights
compare as equal, and characters with unequal weights compare
according to the relative magnitude of their weights.

The [`WEIGHT_STRING()`](string-functions.md#function_weight-string) function can be
used to see the weights for the characters in a string. The value
that it returns to indicate weights is a binary string, so it is
convenient to use
`HEX(WEIGHT_STRING(str))`
to display the weights in printable form. The following example
shows that weights do not differ for lettercase for the letters in
`'AaBb'` if it is a nonbinary case-insensitive
string, but do differ if it is a binary string:

```sql
mysql> SELECT HEX(WEIGHT_STRING('AaBb' COLLATE latin1_swedish_ci));
+------------------------------------------------------+
| HEX(WEIGHT_STRING('AaBb' COLLATE latin1_swedish_ci)) |
+------------------------------------------------------+
| 41414242                                             |
+------------------------------------------------------+
mysql> SELECT HEX(WEIGHT_STRING(BINARY 'AaBb'));
+-----------------------------------+
| HEX(WEIGHT_STRING(BINARY 'AaBb')) |
+-----------------------------------+
| 41614262                          |
+-----------------------------------+
```

MySQL supports several collation implementations, as discussed in
[Section 12.14.1, “Collation Implementation Types”](charset-collation-implementations.md "12.14.1 Collation Implementation Types"). Some of these
can be added to MySQL without recompiling:

- Simple collations for 8-bit character sets.
- UCA-based collations for Unicode character sets.
- Binary (`xxx_bin`)
  collations.

The following sections describe how to add user-defined collations
of the first two types to existing character sets. All existing
character sets already have a binary collation, so there is no
need here to describe how to add one.

Warning

Redefining built-in collations is not supported and may result
in unexpected server behavior.

Summary of the procedure for adding a new user-defined collation:

1. Choose a collation ID.
2. Add configuration information that names the collation and
   describes the character-ordering rules.
3. Restart the server.
4. Verify that the server recognizes the collation.

The instructions here cover only user-defined collations that can
be added without recompiling MySQL. To add a collation that does
require recompiling (as implemented by means of functions in a C
source file), use the instructions in
[Section 12.13, “Adding a Character Set”](adding-character-set.md "12.13 Adding a Character Set"). However, instead of adding
all the information required for a complete character set, just
modify the appropriate files for an existing character set. That
is, based on what is already present for the character set's
current collations, add data structures, functions, and
configuration information for the new collation.

Note

If you modify an existing user-defined collation, that may
affect the ordering of rows for indexes on columns that use the
collation. In this case, rebuild any such indexes to avoid
problems such as incorrect query results. See
[Section 3.14, “Rebuilding or Repairing Tables or Indexes”](rebuilding-tables.md "3.14 Rebuilding or Repairing Tables or Indexes").
