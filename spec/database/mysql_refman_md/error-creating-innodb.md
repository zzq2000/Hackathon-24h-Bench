### 17.21.1 Troubleshooting InnoDB I/O Problems

The troubleshooting steps for `InnoDB` I/O
problems depend on when the problem occurs: during startup of the
MySQL server, or during normal operations when a DML or DDL
statement fails due to problems at the file system level.

#### Initialization Problems

If something goes wrong when `InnoDB` attempts to
initialize its tablespace or its log files, delete all files
created by `InnoDB`: all
`ibdata` files and all redo log files
(`#ib_redoN` files
in MySQL 8.0.30 and higher or `ib_logfile`
files in earlier releases). If you created any
`InnoDB` tables, also delete any
`.ibd` files from the MySQL database
directories. Then try initializing `InnoDB`
again. For easiest troubleshooting, start the MySQL server from a
command prompt so that you see what is happening.

#### Runtime Problems

If `InnoDB` prints an operating system error
during a file operation, usually the problem has one of the
following solutions:

- Make sure the `InnoDB` data file directory
  and the `InnoDB` log directory exist.
- Make sure [**mysqld**](mysqld.md "6.3.1 mysqld — The MySQL Server") has access rights to
  create files in those directories.
- Make sure [**mysqld**](mysqld.md "6.3.1 mysqld — The MySQL Server") can read the proper
  `my.cnf` or `my.ini`
  option file, so that it starts with the options that you
  specified.
- Make sure the disk is not full and you are not exceeding any
  disk quota.
- Make sure that the names you specify for subdirectories and
  data files do not clash.
- Doublecheck the syntax of the
  [`innodb_data_home_dir`](innodb-parameters.md#sysvar_innodb_data_home_dir) and
  [`innodb_data_file_path`](innodb-parameters.md#sysvar_innodb_data_file_path) values.
  In particular, any `MAX` value in the
  [`innodb_data_file_path`](innodb-parameters.md#sysvar_innodb_data_file_path) option
  is a hard limit, and exceeding that limit causes a fatal
  error.
