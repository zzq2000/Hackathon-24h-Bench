#### B.3.4.5 Rollback Failure for Nontransactional Tables

If you receive the following message when trying to perform a
[`ROLLBACK`](commit.md "15.3.1 START TRANSACTION, COMMIT, and ROLLBACK Statements"), it
means that one or more of the tables you used in the
transaction do not support transactions:

```none
Warning: Some non-transactional changed tables couldn't be rolled back
```

These nontransactional tables are not affected by the
[`ROLLBACK`](commit.md "15.3.1 START TRANSACTION, COMMIT, and ROLLBACK Statements")
statement.

If you were not deliberately mixing transactional and
nontransactional tables within the transaction, the most
likely cause for this message is that a table you thought was
transactional actually is not. This can happen if you try to
create a table using a transactional storage engine that is
not supported by your [**mysqld**](mysqld.md "6.3.1 mysqld — The MySQL Server") server (or
that was disabled with a startup option). If
[**mysqld**](mysqld.md "6.3.1 mysqld — The MySQL Server") does not support a storage engine,
it instead creates the table as a `MyISAM`
table, which is nontransactional.

You can check the storage engine for a table by using either
of these statements:

```sql
SHOW TABLE STATUS LIKE 'tbl_name';
SHOW CREATE TABLE tbl_name;
```

See [Section 15.7.7.38, “SHOW TABLE STATUS Statement”](show-table-status.md "15.7.7.38 SHOW TABLE STATUS Statement"), and
[Section 15.7.7.10, “SHOW CREATE TABLE Statement”](show-create-table.md "15.7.7.10 SHOW CREATE TABLE Statement").

To check which storage engines your [**mysqld**](mysqld.md "6.3.1 mysqld — The MySQL Server")
server supports, use this statement:

```sql
SHOW ENGINES;
```

See [Section 15.7.7.16, “SHOW ENGINES Statement”](show-engines.md "15.7.7.16 SHOW ENGINES Statement") for full details.
