#### 25.6.16.2 The ndbinfo arbitrator\_validity\_summary Table

The `arbitrator_validity_summary` table
provides a composite view of the arbitrator with regard to the
cluster's data nodes.

The `arbitrator_validity_summary` table
contains the following columns:

- `arbitrator`

  Node ID of arbitrator
- `arb_ticket`

  Internal identifier used to track arbitration
- `arb_connected`

  Whether this arbitrator is connected to the cluster
- `consensus_count`

  Number of data nodes that see this node as arbitrator;
  either of `Yes` or `No`

##### Notes

In normal operations, this table should have only 1 row for any
appreciable length of time. If it has more than 1 row for longer
than a few moments, then either not all nodes are connected to
the arbitrator, or all nodes are connected, but do not agree on
the same arbitrator.

The `arbitrator` column shows the
arbitrator's node ID.

`arb_ticket` is the internal identifier used by
this arbitrator.

`arb_connected` shows whether this node is
connected to the cluster as an arbitrator.
