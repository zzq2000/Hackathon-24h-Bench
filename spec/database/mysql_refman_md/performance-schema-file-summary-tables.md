#### 29.12.20.7 File I/O Summary Tables

The Performance Schema maintains file I/O summary tables that
aggregate information about I/O operations.

Example file I/O event summary information:

```sql
mysql> SELECT * FROM performance_schema.file_summary_by_event_name\G
...
*************************** 2. row ***************************
               EVENT_NAME: wait/io/file/sql/binlog
               COUNT_STAR: 31
           SUM_TIMER_WAIT: 8243784888
           MIN_TIMER_WAIT: 0
           AVG_TIMER_WAIT: 265928484
           MAX_TIMER_WAIT: 6490658832
...
mysql> SELECT * FROM performance_schema.file_summary_by_instance\G
...
*************************** 2. row ***************************
                FILE_NAME: /var/mysql/share/english/errmsg.sys
               EVENT_NAME: wait/io/file/sql/ERRMSG
               EVENT_NAME: wait/io/file/sql/ERRMSG
    OBJECT_INSTANCE_BEGIN: 4686193384
               COUNT_STAR: 5
           SUM_TIMER_WAIT: 13990154448
           MIN_TIMER_WAIT: 26349624
           AVG_TIMER_WAIT: 2798030607
           MAX_TIMER_WAIT: 8150662536
...
```

Each file I/O summary table has one or more grouping columns
to indicate how the table aggregates events. Event names refer
to names of event instruments in the
[`setup_instruments`](performance-schema-setup-instruments-table.md "29.12.2.3 The setup_instruments Table") table:

- [`file_summary_by_event_name`](performance-schema-file-summary-tables.md "29.12.20.7 File I/O Summary Tables")
  has an `EVENT_NAME` column. Each row
  summarizes events for a given event name.
- [`file_summary_by_instance`](performance-schema-file-summary-tables.md "29.12.20.7 File I/O Summary Tables") has
  `FILE_NAME`,
  `EVENT_NAME`, and
  `OBJECT_INSTANCE_BEGIN` columns. Each row
  summarizes events for a given file and event name.

Each file I/O summary table has the following summary columns
containing aggregated values. Some columns are more general
and have values that are the same as the sum of the values of
more fine-grained columns. In this way, aggregations at higher
levels are available directly without the need for
user-defined views that sum lower-level columns.

- `COUNT_STAR`,
  `SUM_TIMER_WAIT`,
  `MIN_TIMER_WAIT`,
  `AVG_TIMER_WAIT`,
  `MAX_TIMER_WAIT`

  These columns aggregate all I/O operations.
- `COUNT_READ`,
  `SUM_TIMER_READ`,
  `MIN_TIMER_READ`,
  `AVG_TIMER_READ`,
  `MAX_TIMER_READ`,
  `SUM_NUMBER_OF_BYTES_READ`

  These columns aggregate all read operations, including
  `FGETS`, `FGETC`,
  `FREAD`, and `READ`.
- `COUNT_WRITE`,
  `SUM_TIMER_WRITE`,
  `MIN_TIMER_WRITE`,
  `AVG_TIMER_WRITE`,
  `MAX_TIMER_WRITE`,
  `SUM_NUMBER_OF_BYTES_WRITE`

  These columns aggregate all write operations, including
  `FPUTS`, `FPUTC`,
  `FPRINTF`, `VFPRINTF`,
  `FWRITE`, and `PWRITE`.
- `COUNT_MISC`,
  `SUM_TIMER_MISC`,
  `MIN_TIMER_MISC`,
  `AVG_TIMER_MISC`,
  `MAX_TIMER_MISC`

  These columns aggregate all other I/O operations,
  including `CREATE`,
  `DELETE`, `OPEN`,
  `CLOSE`, `STREAM_OPEN`,
  `STREAM_CLOSE`, `SEEK`,
  `TELL`, `FLUSH`,
  `STAT`, `FSTAT`,
  `CHSIZE`, `RENAME`, and
  `SYNC`. There are no byte counts for
  these operations.

The file I/O summary tables have these indexes:

- [`file_summary_by_event_name`](performance-schema-file-summary-tables.md "29.12.20.7 File I/O Summary Tables"):

  - Primary key on (`EVENT_NAME`)
- [`file_summary_by_instance`](performance-schema-file-summary-tables.md "29.12.20.7 File I/O Summary Tables"):

  - Primary key on
    (`OBJECT_INSTANCE_BEGIN`)
  - Index on (`FILE_NAME`)
  - Index on (`EVENT_NAME`)

[`TRUNCATE TABLE`](truncate-table.md "15.1.37 TRUNCATE TABLE Statement") is permitted for
file I/O summary tables. It resets the summary columns to zero
rather than removing rows.

The MySQL server uses several techniques to avoid I/O
operations by caching information read from files, so it is
possible that statements you might expect to result in I/O
events do not do so. You may be able to ensure that I/O does
occur by flushing caches or restarting the server to reset its
state.
