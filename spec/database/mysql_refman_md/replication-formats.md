Replication works because events written to the binary log are
read from the source and then processed on the replica. The events
are recorded within the binary log in different formats according
to the type of event. The different replication formats used
correspond to the binary logging format used when the events were
recorded in the source's binary log. The correlation between
binary logging formats and the terms used during replication are:

- When using statement-based binary logging, the source writes
  SQL statements to the binary log. Replication of the source to
  the replica works by executing the SQL statements on the
  replica. This is called
  statement-based
  replication (which can be abbreviated as
  SBR), which corresponds
  to the MySQL statement-based binary logging format.
- When using row-based logging, the source writes
  events to the binary log
  that indicate how individual table rows are changed.
  Replication of the source to the replica works by copying the
  events representing the changes to the table rows to the
  replica. This is called row-based
  replication (which can be abbreviated as
  RBR).

  Row-based logging is the default method.
- You can also configure MySQL to use a mix of both
  statement-based and row-based logging, depending on which is
  most appropriate for the change to be logged. This is called
  mixed-format logging.
  When using mixed-format logging, a statement-based log is used
  by default. Depending on certain statements, and also the
  storage engine being used, the log is automatically switched
  to row-based in particular cases. Replication using the mixed
  format is referred to as
  mixed-based replication
  or mixed-format
  replication. For more information, see
  [Section 7.4.4.3, “Mixed Binary Logging Format”](binary-log-mixed.md "7.4.4.3 Mixed Binary Logging Format").

**NDB Cluster.**
The default binary logging format in MySQL NDB Cluster 8.0 is
`MIXED`. You should note that NDB Cluster
Replication always uses row-based replication, and that the
[`NDB`](mysql-cluster.md "Chapter 25 MySQL NDB Cluster 8.0") storage engine is incompatible
with statement-based replication. See
[Section 25.7.2, “General Requirements for NDB Cluster Replication”](mysql-cluster-replication-general.md "25.7.2 General Requirements for NDB Cluster Replication"), for more
information.

When using `MIXED` format, the binary logging
format is determined in part by the storage engine being used and
the statement being executed. For more information on mixed-format
logging and the rules governing the support of different logging
formats, see [Section 7.4.4.3, “Mixed Binary Logging Format”](binary-log-mixed.md "7.4.4.3 Mixed Binary Logging Format").

The logging format in a running MySQL server is controlled by
setting the [`binlog_format`](replication-options-binary-log.md#sysvar_binlog_format) server
system variable. This variable can be set with session or global
scope. The rules governing when and how the new setting takes
effect are the same as for other MySQL server system variables.
Setting the variable for the current session lasts only until the
end of that session, and the change is not visible to other
sessions. Setting the variable globally takes effect for clients
that connect after the change, but not for any current client
sessions, including the session where the variable setting was
changed. To make the global system variable setting permanent so
that it applies across server restarts, you must set it in an
option file. For more information, see
[Section 15.7.6.1, “SET Syntax for Variable Assignment”](set-variable.md "15.7.6.1 SET Syntax for Variable Assignment").

There are conditions under which you cannot change the binary
logging format at runtime or doing so causes replication to fail.
See [Section 7.4.4.2, “Setting The Binary Log Format”](binary-log-setting.md "7.4.4.2 Setting The Binary Log Format").

Changing the global [`binlog_format`](replication-options-binary-log.md#sysvar_binlog_format)
value requires privileges sufficient to set global system
variables. Changing the session
[`binlog_format`](replication-options-binary-log.md#sysvar_binlog_format) value requires
privileges sufficient to set restricted session system variables.
See [Section 7.1.9.1, “System Variable Privileges”](system-variable-privileges.md "7.1.9.1 System Variable Privileges").

Note

Changing the binary logging format
([`binlog_format`](replication-options-binary-log.md#sysvar_binlog_format) system variable)
is deprecated as of MySQL 8.0.34. In a future version of MySQL,
you can expect [`binlog_format`](replication-options-binary-log.md#sysvar_binlog_format) to
be removed altogether, and for the row-based format to become
the only logging format used by MySQL.

The statement-based and row-based replication formats have
different issues and limitations. For a comparison of their
relative advantages and disadvantages, see
[Section 19.2.1.1, “Advantages and Disadvantages of Statement-Based and Row-Based
Replication”](replication-sbr-rbr.md "19.2.1.1 Advantages and Disadvantages of Statement-Based and Row-Based Replication").

With statement-based replication, you may encounter issues with
replicating stored routines or triggers. You can avoid these
issues by using row-based replication instead. For more
information, see [Section 27.7, “Stored Program Binary Logging”](stored-programs-logging.md "27.7 Stored Program Binary Logging").
