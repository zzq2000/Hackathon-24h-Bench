#### B.3.2.9 Communication Errors and Aborted Connections

If connection problems occur such as communication errors or
aborted connections, use these sources of information to
diagnose problems:

- The error log. See [Section 7.4.2, “The Error Log”](error-log.md "7.4.2 The Error Log").
- The general query log. See [Section 7.4.3, “The General Query Log”](query-log.md "7.4.3 The General Query Log").
- The
  `Aborted_xxx`
  and
  `Connection_errors_xxx`
  status variables. See
  [Section 7.1.10, “Server Status Variables”](server-status-variables.md "7.1.10 Server Status Variables").
- The host cache, which is accessible using the Performance
  Schema [`host_cache`](performance-schema-host-cache-table.md "29.12.21.3 The host_cache Table") table. See
  [Section 7.1.12.3, “DNS Lookups and the Host Cache”](host-cache.md "7.1.12.3 DNS Lookups and the Host Cache"), and
  [Section 29.12.21.3, “The host\_cache Table”](performance-schema-host-cache-table.md "29.12.21.3 The host_cache Table").

If the [`log_error_verbosity`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_log_error_verbosity)
system variable is set to 3, you might find messages like this
in your error log:

```none
[Note] Aborted connection 854 to db: 'employees' user: 'josh'
```

If a client is unable even to connect, the server increments
the [`Aborted_connects`](server-status-variables.md#statvar_Aborted_connects) status
variable. Unsuccessful connection attempts can occur for the
following reasons:

- A client attempts to access a database but has no
  privileges for it.
- A client uses an incorrect password.
- A connection packet does not contain the right
  information.
- It takes more than
  [`connect_timeout`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_connect_timeout) seconds
  to obtain a connect packet. See
  [Section 7.1.8, “Server System Variables”](server-system-variables.md "7.1.8 Server System Variables").

If these kinds of things happen, it might indicate that
someone is trying to break into your server! If the general
query log is enabled, messages for these types of problems are
logged to it.

If a client successfully connects but later disconnects
improperly or is terminated, the server increments the
[`Aborted_clients`](server-status-variables.md#statvar_Aborted_clients) status
variable, and logs an Aborted
connection message to the error log. The cause can
be any of the following:

- The client program did not call
  [`mysql_close()`](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/c-api/8.0/en/mysql-close.html) before
  exiting.
- The client had been sleeping more than
  [`wait_timeout`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_wait_timeout) or
  [`interactive_timeout`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_interactive_timeout)
  seconds without issuing any requests to the server. See
  [Section 7.1.8, “Server System Variables”](server-system-variables.md "7.1.8 Server System Variables").
- The client program ended abruptly in the middle of a data
  transfer.

Other reasons for problems with aborted connections or aborted
clients:

- The [`max_allowed_packet`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_max_allowed_packet)
  variable value is too small or queries require more memory
  than you have allocated for [**mysqld**](mysqld.md "6.3.1 mysqld — The MySQL Server"). See
  [Section B.3.2.8, “Packet Too Large”](packet-too-large.md "B.3.2.8 Packet Too Large").
- Use of Ethernet protocol with Linux, both half and full
  duplex. Some Linux Ethernet drivers have this bug. You
  should test for this bug by transferring a huge file using
  FTP between the client and server machines. If a transfer
  goes in burst-pause-burst-pause mode, you are experiencing
  a Linux duplex syndrome. Switch the duplex mode for both
  your network card and hub/switch to either full duplex or
  to half duplex and test the results to determine the best
  setting.
- A problem with the thread library that causes interrupts
  on reads.
- Badly configured TCP/IP.
- Faulty Ethernets, hubs, switches, cables, and so forth.
  This can be diagnosed properly only by replacing hardware.
