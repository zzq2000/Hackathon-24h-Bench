#### 17.6.1.6 AUTO\_INCREMENT Handling in InnoDB

`InnoDB` provides a configurable locking
mechanism that can significantly improve scalability and
performance of SQL statements that add rows to tables with
`AUTO_INCREMENT` columns. To use the
`AUTO_INCREMENT` mechanism with an
`InnoDB` table, an
`AUTO_INCREMENT` column must be defined as the
first or only column of some index such that it is possible to
perform the equivalent of an indexed `SELECT
MAX(ai_col)` lookup on the
table to obtain the maximum column value. The index is not
required to be a `PRIMARY KEY` or
`UNIQUE`, but to avoid duplicate values in the
`AUTO_INCREMENT` column, those index types are
recommended.

This section describes the `AUTO_INCREMENT` lock
modes, usage implications of different
`AUTO_INCREMENT` lock mode settings, and how
`InnoDB` initializes the
`AUTO_INCREMENT` counter.

##### InnoDB AUTO\_INCREMENT Lock Modes

This section describes the `AUTO_INCREMENT`
lock modes used to generate auto-increment values, and how each
lock mode affects replication. The auto-increment lock mode is
configured at startup using the
[`innodb_autoinc_lock_mode`](innodb-parameters.md#sysvar_innodb_autoinc_lock_mode)
variable.

The following terms are used in describing
[`innodb_autoinc_lock_mode`](innodb-parameters.md#sysvar_innodb_autoinc_lock_mode)
settings:

- “[`INSERT`](insert.md "15.2.7 INSERT Statement")-like”
  statements

  All statements that generate new rows in a table, including
  [`INSERT`](insert.md "15.2.7 INSERT Statement"),
  [`INSERT ...
  SELECT`](insert-select.md "15.2.7.1 INSERT ... SELECT Statement"), [`REPLACE`](replace.md "15.2.12 REPLACE Statement"),
  [`REPLACE ...
  SELECT`](replace.md "15.2.12 REPLACE Statement"), and [`LOAD
  DATA`](load-data.md "15.2.9 LOAD DATA Statement"). Includes “simple-inserts”,
  “bulk-inserts”, and “mixed-mode”
  inserts.
- “Simple inserts”

  Statements for which the number of rows to be inserted can
  be determined in advance (when the statement is initially
  processed). This includes single-row and multiple-row
  [`INSERT`](insert.md "15.2.7 INSERT Statement") and
  [`REPLACE`](replace.md "15.2.12 REPLACE Statement") statements that do
  not have a nested subquery, but not
  [`INSERT
  ... ON DUPLICATE KEY UPDATE`](insert-on-duplicate.md "15.2.7.2 INSERT ... ON DUPLICATE KEY UPDATE Statement").
- “Bulk inserts”

  Statements for which the number of rows to be inserted (and
  the number of required auto-increment values) is not known
  in advance. This includes
  [`INSERT ...
  SELECT`](insert-select.md "15.2.7.1 INSERT ... SELECT Statement"),
  [`REPLACE ...
  SELECT`](replace.md "15.2.12 REPLACE Statement"), and [`LOAD
  DATA`](load-data.md "15.2.9 LOAD DATA Statement") statements, but not plain
  `INSERT`. `InnoDB` assigns
  new values for the `AUTO_INCREMENT` column
  one at a time as each row is processed.
- “Mixed-mode inserts”

  These are “simple insert” statements that
  specify the auto-increment value for some (but not all) of
  the new rows. An example follows, where
  `c1` is an
  `AUTO_INCREMENT` column of table
  `t1`:

  ```sql
  INSERT INTO t1 (c1,c2) VALUES (1,'a'), (NULL,'b'), (5,'c'), (NULL,'d');
  ```

  Another type of “mixed-mode insert” is
  [`INSERT
  ... ON DUPLICATE KEY UPDATE`](insert-on-duplicate.md "15.2.7.2 INSERT ... ON DUPLICATE KEY UPDATE Statement"), which in the worst
  case is in effect an [`INSERT`](insert.md "15.2.7 INSERT Statement")
  followed by a [`UPDATE`](update.md "15.2.17 UPDATE Statement"), where
  the allocated value for the
  `AUTO_INCREMENT` column may or may not be
  used during the update phase.

There are three possible settings for the
[`innodb_autoinc_lock_mode`](innodb-parameters.md#sysvar_innodb_autoinc_lock_mode)
variable. The settings are 0, 1, or 2, for
“traditional”, “consecutive”, or
“interleaved” lock mode, respectively. As of MySQL
8.0, interleaved lock mode
([`innodb_autoinc_lock_mode=2`](innodb-parameters.md#sysvar_innodb_autoinc_lock_mode)) is
the default setting. Prior to MySQL 8.0, consecutive lock mode
is the default
([`innodb_autoinc_lock_mode=1`](innodb-parameters.md#sysvar_innodb_autoinc_lock_mode)).

The default setting of interleaved lock mode in MySQL
8.0 reflects the change from statement-based
replication to row based replication as the default replication
type. Statement-based replication requires the consecutive
auto-increment lock mode to ensure that auto-increment values
are assigned in a predictable and repeatable order for a given
sequence of SQL statements, whereas row-based replication is not
sensitive to the execution order of SQL statements.

- `innodb_autoinc_lock_mode = 0`
  (“traditional” lock mode)

  The traditional lock mode provides the same behavior that
  existed before the
  [`innodb_autoinc_lock_mode`](innodb-parameters.md#sysvar_innodb_autoinc_lock_mode)
  variable was introduced. The traditional lock mode option is
  provided for backward compatibility, performance testing,
  and working around issues with “mixed-mode inserts”, due
  to possible differences in semantics.

  In this lock mode, all “INSERT-like” statements
  obtain a special table-level `AUTO-INC`
  lock for inserts into tables with
  `AUTO_INCREMENT` columns. This lock is
  normally held to the end of the statement (not to the end of
  the transaction) to ensure that auto-increment values are
  assigned in a predictable and repeatable order for a given
  sequence of [`INSERT`](insert.md "15.2.7 INSERT Statement")
  statements, and to ensure that auto-increment values
  assigned by any given statement are consecutive.

  In the case of statement-based replication, this means that
  when an SQL statement is replicated on a replica server, the
  same values are used for the auto-increment column as on the
  source server. The result of execution of multiple
  [`INSERT`](insert.md "15.2.7 INSERT Statement") statements is
  deterministic, and the replica reproduces the same data as
  on the source. If auto-increment values generated by
  multiple [`INSERT`](insert.md "15.2.7 INSERT Statement") statements
  were interleaved, the result of two concurrent
  [`INSERT`](insert.md "15.2.7 INSERT Statement") statements would be
  nondeterministic, and could not reliably be propagated to a
  replica server using statement-based replication.

  To make this clear, consider an example that uses this
  table:

  ```sql
  CREATE TABLE t1 (
    c1 INT(11) NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT,
    c2 VARCHAR(10) DEFAULT NULL,
    PRIMARY KEY (c1)
  ) ENGINE=InnoDB;
  ```

  Suppose that there are two transactions running, each
  inserting rows into a table with an
  `AUTO_INCREMENT` column. One transaction is
  using an
  [`INSERT ...
  SELECT`](insert-select.md "15.2.7.1 INSERT ... SELECT Statement") statement that inserts 1000 rows, and
  another is using a simple
  [`INSERT`](insert.md "15.2.7 INSERT Statement") statement that inserts
  one row:

  ```sql
  Tx1: INSERT INTO t1 (c2) SELECT 1000 rows from another table ...
  Tx2: INSERT INTO t1 (c2) VALUES ('xxx');
  ```

  `InnoDB` cannot tell in advance how many
  rows are retrieved from the
  [`SELECT`](select.md "15.2.13 SELECT Statement") in the
  [`INSERT`](insert.md "15.2.7 INSERT Statement") statement in Tx1, and
  it assigns the auto-increment values one at a time as the
  statement proceeds. With a table-level lock, held to the end
  of the statement, only one
  [`INSERT`](insert.md "15.2.7 INSERT Statement") statement referring to
  table `t1` can execute at a time, and the
  generation of auto-increment numbers by different statements
  is not interleaved. The auto-increment values generated by
  the Tx1
  [`INSERT ...
  SELECT`](insert-select.md "15.2.7.1 INSERT ... SELECT Statement") statement are consecutive, and the (single)
  auto-increment value used by the
  [`INSERT`](insert.md "15.2.7 INSERT Statement") statement in Tx2 is
  either smaller or larger than all those used for Tx1,
  depending on which statement executes first.

  As long as the SQL statements execute in the same order when
  replayed from the binary log (when using statement-based
  replication, or in recovery scenarios), the results are the
  same as they were when Tx1 and Tx2 first ran. Thus,
  table-level locks held until the end of a statement make
  [`INSERT`](insert.md "15.2.7 INSERT Statement") statements using
  auto-increment safe for use with statement-based
  replication. However, those table-level locks limit
  concurrency and scalability when multiple transactions are
  executing insert statements at the same time.

  In the preceding example, if there were no table-level lock,
  the value of the auto-increment column used for the
  [`INSERT`](insert.md "15.2.7 INSERT Statement") in Tx2 depends on
  precisely when the statement executes. If the
  [`INSERT`](insert.md "15.2.7 INSERT Statement") of Tx2 executes while
  the [`INSERT`](insert.md "15.2.7 INSERT Statement") of Tx1 is running
  (rather than before it starts or after it completes), the
  specific auto-increment values assigned by the two
  [`INSERT`](insert.md "15.2.7 INSERT Statement") statements are
  nondeterministic, and may vary from run to run.

  Under the
  [consecutive](innodb-auto-increment-handling.md#innodb-auto-increment-lock-mode-consecutive)
  lock mode, `InnoDB` can avoid using
  table-level `AUTO-INC` locks for
  “simple insert” statements where the number of
  rows is known in advance, and still preserve deterministic
  execution and safety for statement-based replication.

  If you are not using the binary log to replay SQL statements
  as part of recovery or replication, the
  [interleaved](innodb-auto-increment-handling.md#innodb-auto-increment-lock-mode-interleaved)
  lock mode can be used to eliminate all use of table-level
  `AUTO-INC` locks for even greater
  concurrency and performance, at the cost of permitting gaps
  in auto-increment numbers assigned by a statement and
  potentially having the numbers assigned by concurrently
  executing statements interleaved.
- `innodb_autoinc_lock_mode = 1`
  (“consecutive” lock mode)

  In this mode, “bulk inserts” use the special
  `AUTO-INC` table-level lock and hold it
  until the end of the statement. This applies to all
  [`INSERT ...
  SELECT`](insert-select.md "15.2.7.1 INSERT ... SELECT Statement"),
  [`REPLACE ...
  SELECT`](replace.md "15.2.12 REPLACE Statement"), and [`LOAD
  DATA`](load-data.md "15.2.9 LOAD DATA Statement") statements. Only one statement holding the
  `AUTO-INC` lock can execute at a time. If
  the source table of the bulk insert operation is different
  from the target table, the `AUTO-INC` lock
  on the target table is taken after a shared lock is taken on
  the first row selected from the source table. If the source
  and target of the bulk insert operation are the same table,
  the `AUTO-INC` lock is taken after shared
  locks are taken on all selected rows.

  “Simple inserts” (for which the number of rows
  to be inserted is known in advance) avoid table-level
  `AUTO-INC` locks by obtaining the required
  number of auto-increment values under the control of a mutex
  (a light-weight lock) that is only held for the duration of
  the allocation process, *not* until the
  statement completes. No table-level
  `AUTO-INC` lock is used unless an
  `AUTO-INC` lock is held by another
  transaction. If another transaction holds an
  `AUTO-INC` lock, a “simple
  insert” waits for the `AUTO-INC`
  lock, as if it were a “bulk insert”.

  This lock mode ensures that, in the presence of
  [`INSERT`](insert.md "15.2.7 INSERT Statement") statements where the
  number of rows is not known in advance (and where
  auto-increment numbers are assigned as the statement
  progresses), all auto-increment values assigned by any
  “[`INSERT`](insert.md "15.2.7 INSERT Statement")-like”
  statement are consecutive, and operations are safe for
  statement-based replication.

  Simply put, this lock mode significantly improves
  scalability while being safe for use with statement-based
  replication. Further, as with “traditional”
  lock mode, auto-increment numbers assigned by any given
  statement are *consecutive*. There is
  *no change* in semantics compared to
  “traditional” mode for any statement that uses
  auto-increment, with one important exception.

  The exception is for “mixed-mode inserts”,
  where the user provides explicit values for an
  `AUTO_INCREMENT` column for some, but not
  all, rows in a multiple-row “simple insert”.
  For such inserts, `InnoDB` allocates more
  auto-increment values than the number of rows to be
  inserted. However, all values automatically assigned are
  consecutively generated (and thus higher than) the
  auto-increment value generated by the most recently executed
  previous statement. “Excess” numbers are lost.
- `innodb_autoinc_lock_mode = 2`
  (“interleaved” lock mode)

  In this lock mode, no
  “[`INSERT`](insert.md "15.2.7 INSERT Statement")-like”
  statements use the table-level `AUTO-INC`
  lock, and multiple statements can execute at the same time.
  This is the fastest and most scalable lock mode, but it is
  *not safe* when using statement-based
  replication or recovery scenarios when SQL statements are
  replayed from the binary log.

  In this lock mode, auto-increment values are guaranteed to
  be unique and monotonically increasing across all
  concurrently executing
  “[`INSERT`](insert.md "15.2.7 INSERT Statement")-like”
  statements. However, because multiple statements can be
  generating numbers at the same time (that is, allocation of
  numbers is *interleaved* across
  statements), the values generated for the rows inserted by
  any given statement may not be consecutive.

  If the only statements executing are “simple
  inserts” where the number of rows to be inserted is
  known ahead of time, there are no gaps in the numbers
  generated for a single statement, except for
  “mixed-mode inserts”. However, when “bulk
  inserts” are executed, there may be gaps in the
  auto-increment values assigned by any given statement.

##### InnoDB AUTO\_INCREMENT Lock Mode Usage Implications

- Using auto-increment with replication

  If you are using statement-based replication, set
  [`innodb_autoinc_lock_mode`](innodb-parameters.md#sysvar_innodb_autoinc_lock_mode) to
  0 or 1 and use the same value on the source and its
  replicas. Auto-increment values are not ensured to be the
  same on the replicas as on the source if you use
  [`innodb_autoinc_lock_mode`](innodb-parameters.md#sysvar_innodb_autoinc_lock_mode) =
  2 (“interleaved”) or configurations where the
  source and replicas do not use the same lock mode.

  If you are using row-based or mixed-format replication, all
  of the auto-increment lock modes are safe, since row-based
  replication is not sensitive to the order of execution of
  the SQL statements (and the mixed format uses row-based
  replication for any statements that are unsafe for
  statement-based replication).
- “Lost” auto-increment values and sequence gaps

  In all lock modes (0, 1, and 2), if a transaction that
  generated auto-increment values rolls back, those
  auto-increment values are “lost”. Once a value
  is generated for an auto-increment column, it cannot be
  rolled back, whether or not the
  “[`INSERT`](insert.md "15.2.7 INSERT Statement")-like”
  statement is completed, and whether or not the containing
  transaction is rolled back. Such lost values are not reused.
  Thus, there may be gaps in the values stored in an
  `AUTO_INCREMENT` column of a table.
- Specifying NULL or 0 for the
  `AUTO_INCREMENT` column

  In all lock modes (0, 1, and 2), if a user specifies NULL or
  0 for the `AUTO_INCREMENT` column in an
  [`INSERT`](insert.md "15.2.7 INSERT Statement"),
  `InnoDB` treats the row as if the value was
  not specified and generates a new value for it.
- Assigning a negative value to the
  `AUTO_INCREMENT` column

  In all lock modes (0, 1, and 2), the behavior of the
  auto-increment mechanism is undefined if you assign a
  negative value to the `AUTO_INCREMENT`
  column.
- If the `AUTO_INCREMENT` value becomes
  larger than the maximum integer for the specified integer
  type

  In all lock modes (0, 1, and 2), the behavior of the
  auto-increment mechanism is undefined if the value becomes
  larger than the maximum integer that can be stored in the
  specified integer type.
- Gaps in auto-increment values for “bulk
  inserts”

  With
  [`innodb_autoinc_lock_mode`](innodb-parameters.md#sysvar_innodb_autoinc_lock_mode)
  set to 0 (“traditional”) or 1
  (“consecutive”), the auto-increment values
  generated by any given statement are consecutive, without
  gaps, because the table-level `AUTO-INC`
  lock is held until the end of the statement, and only one
  such statement can execute at a time.

  With
  [`innodb_autoinc_lock_mode`](innodb-parameters.md#sysvar_innodb_autoinc_lock_mode)
  set to 2 (“interleaved”), there may be gaps in
  the auto-increment values generated by “bulk
  inserts,” but only if there are concurrently
  executing
  “[`INSERT`](insert.md "15.2.7 INSERT Statement")-like”
  statements.

  For lock modes 1 or 2, gaps may occur between successive
  statements because for bulk inserts the exact number of
  auto-increment values required by each statement may not be
  known and overestimation is possible.
- Auto-increment values assigned by “mixed-mode
  inserts”

  Consider a “mixed-mode insert,” where a
  “simple insert” specifies the auto-increment
  value for some (but not all) resulting rows. Such a
  statement behaves differently in lock modes 0, 1, and 2. For
  example, assume `c1` is an
  `AUTO_INCREMENT` column of table
  `t1`, and that the most recent
  automatically generated sequence number is 100.

  ```sql
  mysql> CREATE TABLE t1 (
      -> c1 INT UNSIGNED NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
      -> c2 CHAR(1)
      -> ) ENGINE = INNODB;
  ```

  Now, consider the following “mixed-mode insert”
  statement:

  ```sql
  mysql> INSERT INTO t1 (c1,c2) VALUES (1,'a'), (NULL,'b'), (5,'c'), (NULL,'d');
  ```

  With
  [`innodb_autoinc_lock_mode`](innodb-parameters.md#sysvar_innodb_autoinc_lock_mode)
  set to 0 (“traditional”), the four new rows
  are:

  ```sql
  mysql> SELECT c1, c2 FROM t1 ORDER BY c2;
  +-----+------+
  | c1  | c2   |
  +-----+------+
  |   1 | a    |
  | 101 | b    |
  |   5 | c    |
  | 102 | d    |
  +-----+------+
  ```

  The next available auto-increment value is 103 because the
  auto-increment values are allocated one at a time, not all
  at once at the beginning of statement execution. This result
  is true whether or not there are concurrently executing
  “[`INSERT`](insert.md "15.2.7 INSERT Statement")-like”
  statements (of any type).

  With
  [`innodb_autoinc_lock_mode`](innodb-parameters.md#sysvar_innodb_autoinc_lock_mode)
  set to 1 (“consecutive”), the four new rows are
  also:

  ```sql
  mysql> SELECT c1, c2 FROM t1 ORDER BY c2;
  +-----+------+
  | c1  | c2   |
  +-----+------+
  |   1 | a    |
  | 101 | b    |
  |   5 | c    |
  | 102 | d    |
  +-----+------+
  ```

  However, in this case, the next available auto-increment
  value is 105, not 103 because four auto-increment values are
  allocated at the time the statement is processed, but only
  two are used. This result is true whether or not there are
  concurrently executing
  “[`INSERT`](insert.md "15.2.7 INSERT Statement")-like”
  statements (of any type).

  With
  [`innodb_autoinc_lock_mode`](innodb-parameters.md#sysvar_innodb_autoinc_lock_mode)
  set to 2 (“interleaved”), the four new rows
  are:

  ```sql
  mysql> SELECT c1, c2 FROM t1 ORDER BY c2;
  +-----+------+
  | c1  | c2   |
  +-----+------+
  |   1 | a    |
  |   x | b    |
  |   5 | c    |
  |   y | d    |
  +-----+------+
  ```

  The values of *`x`* and
  *`y`* are unique and larger than any
  previously generated rows. However, the specific values of
  *`x`* and
  *`y`* depend on the number of
  auto-increment values generated by concurrently executing
  statements.

  Finally, consider the following statement, issued when the
  most-recently generated sequence number is 100:

  ```sql
  mysql> INSERT INTO t1 (c1,c2) VALUES (1,'a'), (NULL,'b'), (101,'c'), (NULL,'d');
  ```

  With any
  [`innodb_autoinc_lock_mode`](innodb-parameters.md#sysvar_innodb_autoinc_lock_mode)
  setting, this statement generates a duplicate-key error
  23000 (`Can't write; duplicate key in
  table`) because 101 is allocated for the row
  `(NULL, 'b')` and insertion of the row
  `(101, 'c')` fails.
- Modifying `AUTO_INCREMENT` column values in
  the middle of a sequence of
  [`INSERT`](insert.md "15.2.7 INSERT Statement") statements

  In MySQL 5.7 and earlier, modifying an
  `AUTO_INCREMENT` column value in the middle
  of a sequence of [`INSERT`](insert.md "15.2.7 INSERT Statement")
  statements could lead to “Duplicate entry”
  errors. For example, if you performed an
  [`UPDATE`](update.md "15.2.17 UPDATE Statement") operation that changed
  an `AUTO_INCREMENT` column value to a value
  larger than the current maximum auto-increment value,
  subsequent [`INSERT`](insert.md "15.2.7 INSERT Statement") operations
  that did not specify an unused auto-increment value could
  encounter “Duplicate entry” errors. In MySQL
  8.0 and later, if you modify an
  `AUTO_INCREMENT` column value to a value
  larger than the current maximum auto-increment value, the
  new value is persisted, and subsequent
  [`INSERT`](insert.md "15.2.7 INSERT Statement") operations allocate
  auto-increment values starting from the new, larger value.
  This behavior is demonstrated in the following example.

  ```sql
  mysql> CREATE TABLE t1 (
      -> c1 INT NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT,
      -> PRIMARY KEY (c1)
      ->  ) ENGINE = InnoDB;

  mysql> INSERT INTO t1 VALUES(0), (0), (3);

  mysql> SELECT c1 FROM t1;
  +----+
  | c1 |
  +----+
  |  1 |
  |  2 |
  |  3 |
  +----+

  mysql> UPDATE t1 SET c1 = 4 WHERE c1 = 1;

  mysql> SELECT c1 FROM t1;
  +----+
  | c1 |
  +----+
  |  2 |
  |  3 |
  |  4 |
  +----+

  mysql> INSERT INTO t1 VALUES(0);

  mysql> SELECT c1 FROM t1;
  +----+
  | c1 |
  +----+
  |  2 |
  |  3 |
  |  4 |
  |  5 |
  +----+
  ```

##### InnoDB AUTO\_INCREMENT Counter Initialization

This section describes how `InnoDB` initializes
`AUTO_INCREMENT` counters.

If you specify an `AUTO_INCREMENT` column for
an `InnoDB` table, the in-memory table object
contains a special counter called the auto-increment counter
that is used when assigning new values for the column.

In MySQL 5.7 and earlier, the auto-increment counter is stored
in main memory, not on disk. To initialize an auto-increment
counter after a server restart, `InnoDB` would
execute the equivalent of the following statement on the first
insert into a table containing an
`AUTO_INCREMENT` column.

```sql
SELECT MAX(ai_col) FROM table_name FOR UPDATE;
```

In MySQL 8.0, this behavior is changed. The current maximum
auto-increment counter value is written to the redo log each
time it changes and saved to the data dictionary on each
checkpoint. These changes make the current maximum
auto-increment counter value persistent across server restarts.

On a server restart following a normal shutdown,
`InnoDB` initializes the in-memory
auto-increment counter using the current maximum auto-increment
value stored in the data dictionary.

On a server restart during crash recovery,
`InnoDB` initializes the in-memory
auto-increment counter using the current maximum auto-increment
value stored in the data dictionary and scans the redo log for
auto-increment counter values written since the last checkpoint.
If a redo-logged value is greater than the in-memory counter
value, the redo-logged value is applied. However, in the case of
an unexpected server exit, reuse of a previously allocated
auto-increment value cannot be guaranteed. Each time the current
maximum auto-increment value is changed due to an
[`INSERT`](insert.md "15.2.7 INSERT Statement") or
[`UPDATE`](update.md "15.2.17 UPDATE Statement") operation, the new value
is written to the redo log, but if the unexpected exit occurs
before the redo log is flushed to disk, the previously allocated
value could be reused when the auto-increment counter is
initialized after the server is restarted.

The only circumstance in which `InnoDB` uses
the equivalent of a `SELECT MAX(ai_col) FROM
table_name FOR UPDATE`
statement to initialize an auto-increment counter is when
[importing a table](innodb-table-import.md "17.6.1.3 Importing InnoDB Tables")
without a `.cfg` metadata file. Otherwise,
the current maximum auto-increment counter value is read from
the `.cfg` metadata file if present. Aside
from counter value initialization, the equivalent of a
`SELECT MAX(ai_col) FROM
table_name` statement is
used to determine the current maximum auto-increment counter
value of the table when attempting to set the counter value to
one that is smaller than or equal to the persisted counter value
using an `ALTER TABLE ... AUTO_INCREMENT =
N` statement. For example,
you might try to set the counter value to a lesser value after
deleting some records. In this case, the table must be searched
to ensure that the new counter value is not less than or equal
to the actual current maximum counter value.

In MySQL 5.7 and earlier, a server restart cancels the effect of
the `AUTO_INCREMENT = N` table option, which
may be used in a `CREATE TABLE` or
`ALTER TABLE` statement to set an initial
counter value or alter the existing counter value, respectively.
In MySQL 8.0, a server restart does not cancel the effect of the
`AUTO_INCREMENT = N` table option. If you
initialize the auto-increment counter to a specific value, or if
you alter the auto-increment counter value to a larger value,
the new value is persisted across server restarts.

Note

[`ALTER TABLE ...
AUTO_INCREMENT = N`](alter-table.md "15.1.9 ALTER TABLE Statement") can only change the
auto-increment counter value to a value larger than the
current maximum.

In MySQL 5.7 and earlier, a server restart immediately following
a [`ROLLBACK`](commit.md "15.3.1 START TRANSACTION, COMMIT, and ROLLBACK Statements")
operation could result in the reuse of auto-increment values
that were previously allocated to the rolled-back transaction,
effectively rolling back the current maximum auto-increment
value. In MySQL 8.0, the current maximum auto-increment value is
persisted, preventing the reuse of previously allocated values.

If a [`SHOW TABLE STATUS`](show-table-status.md "15.7.7.38 SHOW TABLE STATUS Statement") statement
examines a table before the auto-increment counter is
initialized, `InnoDB` opens the table and
initializes the counter value using the current maximum
auto-increment value that is stored in the data dictionary. The
value is then stored in memory for use by later inserts or
updates. Initialization of the counter value uses a normal
exclusive-locking read on the table which lasts to the end of
the transaction. `InnoDB` follows the same
procedure when initializing the auto-increment counter for a
newly created table that has a user-specified auto-increment
value greater than 0.

After the auto-increment counter is initialized, if you do not
explicitly specify an auto-increment value when inserting a row,
`InnoDB` implicitly increments the counter and
assigns the new value to the column. If you insert a row that
explicitly specifies an auto-increment column value, and the
value is greater than the current maximum counter value, the
counter is set to the specified value.

`InnoDB` uses the in-memory auto-increment
counter as long as the server runs. When the server is stopped
and restarted, `InnoDB` reinitializes the
auto-increment counter, as described earlier.

The [`auto_increment_offset`](replication-options-source.md#sysvar_auto_increment_offset)
variable determines the starting point for the
`AUTO_INCREMENT` column value. The default
setting is 1.

The [`auto_increment_increment`](replication-options-source.md#sysvar_auto_increment_increment)
variable controls the interval between successive column values.
The default setting is 1.

##### Notes

When an `AUTO_INCREMENT` integer column runs
out of values, a subsequent `INSERT` operation
returns a duplicate-key error. This is general MySQL behavior.
