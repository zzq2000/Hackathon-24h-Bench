### 7.7.1 Installing and Uninstalling Loadable Functions

Loadable functions, as the name implies, must be loaded into the
server before they can be used. MySQL supports automatic function
loading during server startup and manual loading thereafter.

While a loadable function is loaded, information about it is
available as described in
[Section 7.7.2, “Obtaining Information About Loadable Functions”](obtaining-loadable-function-information.md "7.7.2 Obtaining Information About Loadable Functions").

- [Installing Loadable Functions](function-loading.md#loadable-function-installing "Installing Loadable Functions")
- [Uninstalling Loadable Functions](function-loading.md#loadable-function-uninstalling "Uninstalling Loadable Functions")
- [Reinstalling or Upgrading Loadable Functions](function-loading.md#loadable-function-upgrading "Reinstalling or Upgrading Loadable Functions")

#### Installing Loadable Functions

To load a loadable function manually, use the
[`CREATE
FUNCTION`](create-function-loadable.md "15.7.4.1 CREATE FUNCTION Statement for Loadable Functions") statement. For example:

```sql
CREATE FUNCTION metaphon
  RETURNS STRING
  SONAME 'udf_example.so';
```

The file base name depends on your platform. Common suffixes are
`.so` for Unix and Unix-like systems,
`.dll` for Windows.

[`CREATE
FUNCTION`](create-function-loadable.md "15.7.4.1 CREATE FUNCTION Statement for Loadable Functions") has these effects:

- It loads the function into the server to make it available
  immediately.
- It registers the function in the
  `mysql.func` system table to make it
  persistent across server restarts. For this reason,
  [`CREATE
  FUNCTION`](create-function-loadable.md "15.7.4.1 CREATE FUNCTION Statement for Loadable Functions") requires the
  [`INSERT`](privileges-provided.md#priv_insert) privilege for the
  `mysql` system database.
- It adds the function to the Performance Schema
  [`user_defined_functions`](performance-schema-user-defined-functions-table.md "29.12.21.10 The user_defined_functions Table") table
  that provides runtime information about installed loadable
  functions. See
  [Section 7.7.2, “Obtaining Information About Loadable Functions”](obtaining-loadable-function-information.md "7.7.2 Obtaining Information About Loadable Functions").

Automatic loading of loadable functions occurs during the normal
server startup sequence:

- Functions registered in the `mysql.func`
  table are installed.
- Components or plugins that are installed at startup may
  automatically install related functions.
- Automatic function installation adds the functions to the
  Performance Schema
  [`user_defined_functions`](performance-schema-user-defined-functions-table.md "29.12.21.10 The user_defined_functions Table") table
  that provides runtime information about installed functions.

If the server is started with the
[`--skip-grant-tables`](server-options.md#option_mysqld_skip-grant-tables) option,
functions registered in the `mysql.func` table
are not loaded and are unavailable. This does not apply to
functions installed automatically by a component or plugin.

#### Uninstalling Loadable Functions

To remove a loadable function, use the
[`DROP
FUNCTION`](drop-function-loadable.md "15.7.4.2 DROP FUNCTION Statement for Loadable Functions") statement. For example:

```sql
DROP FUNCTION metaphon;
```

[`DROP
FUNCTION`](drop-function-loadable.md "15.7.4.2 DROP FUNCTION Statement for Loadable Functions") has these effects:

- It unloads the function to make it unavailable.
- It removes the function from the
  `mysql.func` system table. For this reason,
  [`DROP
  FUNCTION`](drop-function-loadable.md "15.7.4.2 DROP FUNCTION Statement for Loadable Functions") requires the
  [`DELETE`](privileges-provided.md#priv_delete) privilege for the
  `mysql` system database. With the function
  no longer registered in the `mysql.func`
  table, the server does not load the function during
  subsequent restarts.
- It removes the function from the Performance Schema
  [`user_defined_functions`](performance-schema-user-defined-functions-table.md "29.12.21.10 The user_defined_functions Table") table
  that provides runtime information about installed loadable
  functions.

[`DROP
FUNCTION`](drop-function-loadable.md "15.7.4.2 DROP FUNCTION Statement for Loadable Functions") cannot be used to drop a loadable function
that is installed automatically by components or plugins rather
than by using
[`CREATE
FUNCTION`](create-function-loadable.md "15.7.4.1 CREATE FUNCTION Statement for Loadable Functions"). Such a function is also dropped
automatically, when the component or plugin that installed it is
uninstalled.

#### Reinstalling or Upgrading Loadable Functions

To reinstall or upgrade the shared library associated with a
loadable function, issue a
[`DROP
FUNCTION`](drop-function-loadable.md "15.7.4.2 DROP FUNCTION Statement for Loadable Functions") statement, upgrade the shared library, and
then issue a
[`CREATE
FUNCTION`](create-function-loadable.md "15.7.4.1 CREATE FUNCTION Statement for Loadable Functions") statement. If you upgrade the shared library
first and then use
[`DROP
FUNCTION`](drop-function-loadable.md "15.7.4.2 DROP FUNCTION Statement for Loadable Functions"), the server may unexpectedly shut down.
