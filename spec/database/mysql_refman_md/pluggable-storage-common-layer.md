### 18.11.2 The Common Database Server Layer

A MySQL pluggable storage engine is the component in the MySQL
database server that is responsible for performing the actual
data I/O operations for a database as well as enabling and
enforcing certain feature sets that target a specific
application need. A major benefit of using specific storage
engines is that you are only delivered the features needed for a
particular application, and therefore you have less system
overhead in the database, with the end result being more
efficient and higher database performance. This is one of the
reasons that MySQL has always been known to have such high
performance, matching or beating proprietary monolithic
databases in industry standard benchmarks.

From a technical perspective, what are some of the unique
supporting infrastructure components that are in a storage
engine? Some of the key feature differentiations include:

- *Concurrency*: Some applications have
  more granular lock requirements (such as row-level locks)
  than others. Choosing the right locking strategy can reduce
  overhead and therefore improve overall performance. This
  area also includes support for capabilities such as
  multi-version concurrency control or “snapshot”
  read.
- *Transaction Support*: Not every
  application needs transactions, but for those that do, there
  are very well defined requirements such as ACID compliance
  and more.
- *Referential Integrity*: The need to have
  the server enforce relational database referential integrity
  through DDL defined foreign keys.
- *Physical Storage*: This involves
  everything from the overall page size for tables and indexes
  as well as the format used for storing data to physical
  disk.
- *Index Support*: Different application
  scenarios tend to benefit from different index strategies.
  Each storage engine generally has its own indexing methods,
  although some (such as B-tree indexes) are common to nearly
  all engines.
- *Memory Caches*: Different applications
  respond better to some memory caching strategies than
  others, so although some memory caches are common to all
  storage engines (such as those used for user connections),
  others are uniquely defined only when a particular storage
  engine is put in play.
- *Performance Aids*: This includes
  multiple I/O threads for parallel operations, thread
  concurrency, database checkpointing, bulk insert handling,
  and more.
- *Miscellaneous Target Features*: This may
  include support for geospatial operations, security
  restrictions for certain data manipulation operations, and
  other similar features.

Each set of the pluggable storage engine infrastructure
components are designed to offer a selective set of benefits for
a particular application. Conversely, avoiding a set of
component features helps reduce unnecessary overhead. It stands
to reason that understanding a particular application's set of
requirements and selecting the proper MySQL storage engine can
have a dramatic impact on overall system efficiency and
performance.
