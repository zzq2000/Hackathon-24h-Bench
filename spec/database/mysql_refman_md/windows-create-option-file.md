#### 2.3.4.2 Creating an Option File

If you need to specify startup options when you run the server,
you can indicate them on the command line or place them in an
option file. For options that are used every time the server
starts, you may find it most convenient to use an option file to
specify your MySQL configuration. This is particularly true
under the following circumstances:

- The installation or data directory locations are different
  from the default locations (`C:\Program
  Files\MySQL\MySQL Server 8.0` and
  `C:\Program Files\MySQL\MySQL Server
  8.0\data`).
- You need to tune the server settings, such as memory, cache,
  or InnoDB configuration information.

When the MySQL server starts on Windows, it looks for option
files in several locations, such as the Windows directory,
`C:\`, and the MySQL installation directory
(for the full list of locations, see
[Section 6.2.2.2, “Using Option Files”](option-files.md "6.2.2.2 Using Option Files")). The Windows directory typically
is named something like `C:\WINDOWS`. You can
determine its exact location from the value of the
`WINDIR` environment variable using the
following command:

```terminal
C:\> echo %WINDIR%
```

MySQL looks for options in each location first in the
`my.ini` file, and then in the
`my.cnf` file. However, to avoid confusion,
it is best if you use only one file. If your PC uses a boot
loader where `C:` is not the boot drive, your
only option is to use the `my.ini` file.
Whichever option file you use, it must be a plain text file.

Note

When using the MySQL Installer to install MySQL Server, it creates the
`my.ini` at the default location, and the
user executing MySQL Installer is granted full permissions to this new
`my.ini` file.

In other words, be sure that the MySQL Server user has
permission to read the `my.ini` file.

You can also make use of the example option files included with
your MySQL distribution; see
[Section 7.1.2, “Server Configuration Defaults”](server-configuration-defaults.md "7.1.2 Server Configuration Defaults").

An option file can be created and modified with any text editor,
such as Notepad. For example, if MySQL is installed in
`E:\mysql` and the data directory is in
`E:\mydata\data`, you can create an option
file containing a `[mysqld]` section to specify
values for the `basedir` and
`datadir` options:

```ini
[mysqld]
# set basedir to your installation path
basedir=E:/mysql
# set datadir to the location of your data directory
datadir=E:/mydata/data
```

Microsoft Windows path names are specified in option files using
(forward) slashes rather than backslashes. If you do use
backslashes, double them:

```ini
[mysqld]
# set basedir to your installation path
basedir=E:\\mysql
# set datadir to the location of your data directory
datadir=E:\\mydata\\data
```

The rules for use of backslash in option file values are given
in [Section 6.2.2.2, “Using Option Files”](option-files.md "6.2.2.2 Using Option Files").

The ZIP archive does not include a `data`
directory. To initialize a MySQL installation by creating the
data directory and populating the tables in the mysql system
database, initialize MySQL using either
[`--initialize`](server-options.md#option_mysqld_initialize) or
[`--initialize-insecure`](server-options.md#option_mysqld_initialize-insecure). For
additional information, see
[Section 2.9.1, “Initializing the Data Directory”](data-directory-initialization.md "2.9.1 Initializing the Data Directory").

If you would like to use a data directory in a different
location, you should copy the entire contents of the
`data` directory to the new location. For
example, if you want to use `E:\mydata` as
the data directory instead, you must do two things:

1. Move the entire `data` directory and all
   of its contents from the default location (for example
   `C:\Program Files\MySQL\MySQL Server
   8.0\data`) to
   `E:\mydata`.
2. Use a [`--datadir`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_datadir) option to
   specify the new data directory location each time you start
   the server.
