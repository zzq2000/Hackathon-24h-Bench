## 32.1 MySQL Enterprise Backup Overview

MySQL Enterprise Backup performs hot backup operations for MySQL databases. The
product is architected for efficient and reliable backups of
tables created by the InnoDB storage engine. For completeness, it
can also back up tables from MyISAM and other storage engines.

The following discussion briefly summarizes MySQL Enterprise Backup. For more
information, see the MySQL Enterprise Backup manual, available at
<https://dev.mysql.com/doc/mysql-enterprise-backup/en/>.

Hot backups are performed while the database is running and
applications are reading and writing to it. This type of backup
does not block normal database operations, and it captures even
changes that occur while the backup is happening. For these
reasons, hot backups are desirable when your database “grows
up” -- when the data is large enough that the backup takes
significant time, and when your data is important enough to your
business that you must capture every last change, without taking
your application, website, or web service offline.

MySQL Enterprise Backup does a hot backup of all tables that use the InnoDB storage
engine. For tables using MyISAM or other non-InnoDB storage
engines, it does a “warm” backup, where the database
continues to run, but those tables cannot be modified while being
backed up. For efficient backup operations, you can designate
InnoDB as the default storage engine for new tables, or convert
existing tables to use the InnoDB storage engine.
