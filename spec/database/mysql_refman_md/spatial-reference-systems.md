### 13.4.5 Spatial Reference System Support

A spatial reference system (SRS) for spatial data is a
coordinate-based system for geographic locations.

There are different types of spatial reference systems:

- A projected SRS is a projection of a globe onto a flat
  surface; that is, a flat map. For example, a light bulb
  inside a globe that shines on a paper cylinder surrounding
  the globe projects a map onto the paper. The result is
  georeferenced: Each point maps to a place on the globe. The
  coordinate system on that plane is Cartesian using a length
  unit (meters, feet, and so forth), rather than degrees of
  longitude and latitude.

  The globes in this case are ellipsoids; that is, flattened
  spheres. Earth is a bit shorter in its North-South axis than
  its East-West axis, so a slightly flattened sphere is more
  correct, but perfect spheres permit faster calculations.
- A geographic SRS is a nonprojected SRS representing
  longitude-latitude (or latitude-longitude) coordinates on an
  ellipsoid, in any angular unit.
- The SRS denoted in MySQL by SRID 0 represents an infinite
  flat Cartesian plane with no units assigned to its axes.
  Unlike projected SRSs, it is not georeferenced and it does
  not necessarily represent Earth. It is an abstract plane
  that can be used for anything. SRID 0 is the default SRID
  for spatial data in MySQL.

MySQL maintains information about available spatial reference
systems for spatial data in the data dictionary
`mysql.st_spatial_reference_systems` table,
which can store entries for projected and geographic SRSs. This
data dictionary table is invisible, but SRS entry contents are
available through the `INFORMATION_SCHEMA`
[`ST_SPATIAL_REFERENCE_SYSTEMS`](information-schema-st-spatial-reference-systems-table.md "28.3.36 The INFORMATION_SCHEMA ST_SPATIAL_REFERENCE_SYSTEMS Table") table,
implemented as a view on
`mysql.st_spatial_reference_systems` (see
[Section 28.3.36, “The INFORMATION\_SCHEMA ST\_SPATIAL\_REFERENCE\_SYSTEMS Table”](information-schema-st-spatial-reference-systems-table.md "28.3.36 The INFORMATION_SCHEMA ST_SPATIAL_REFERENCE_SYSTEMS Table")).

The following example shows what an SRS entry looks like:

```sql
mysql> SELECT *
       FROM INFORMATION_SCHEMA.ST_SPATIAL_REFERENCE_SYSTEMS
       WHERE SRS_ID = 4326\G
*************************** 1. row ***************************
                SRS_NAME: WGS 84
                  SRS_ID: 4326
            ORGANIZATION: EPSG
ORGANIZATION_COORDSYS_ID: 4326
              DEFINITION: GEOGCS["WGS 84",DATUM["World Geodetic System 1984",
                          SPHEROID["WGS 84",6378137,298.257223563,
                          AUTHORITY["EPSG","7030"]],AUTHORITY["EPSG","6326"]],
                          PRIMEM["Greenwich",0,AUTHORITY["EPSG","8901"]],
                          UNIT["degree",0.017453292519943278,
                          AUTHORITY["EPSG","9122"]],
                          AXIS["Lat",NORTH],AXIS["Long",EAST],
                          AUTHORITY["EPSG","4326"]]
             DESCRIPTION:
```

This entry describes the SRS used for GPS systems. It has the
name (`SRS_NAME`) WGS 84 and the ID
(`SRS_ID`) 4326, which is the ID used by the
[European Petroleum Survey
Group](http://epsg.org) (EPSG).

SRS definitions in the `DEFINITION` column are
WKT values, represented as specified in the
[Open Geospatial
Consortium](http://www.opengeospatial.org) document
[OGC
12-063r5](http://docs.opengeospatial.org/is/12-063r5/12-063r5.html).

`SRS_ID` values represent the same kind of
values as the SRID of geometry values or passed as the SRID
argument to spatial functions. SRID 0 (the unitless Cartesian
plane) is special. It is always a legal spatial reference system
ID and can be used in any computations on spatial data that
depend on SRID values.

For computations on multiple geometry values, all values must
have the same SRID or an error occurs.

SRS definition parsing occurs on demand when definitions are
needed by GIS functions. Parsed definitions are stored in the
data dictionary cache to enable reuse and avoid incurring
parsing overhead for every statement that needs SRS information.

To enable manipulation of SRS entries stored in the data
dictionary, MySQL provides these SQL statements:

- [`CREATE SPATIAL REFERENCE
  SYSTEM`](create-spatial-reference-system.md "15.1.19 CREATE SPATIAL REFERENCE SYSTEM Statement"): See
  [Section 15.1.19, “CREATE SPATIAL REFERENCE SYSTEM Statement”](create-spatial-reference-system.md "15.1.19 CREATE SPATIAL REFERENCE SYSTEM Statement"). The
  description for this statement includes additional
  information about SRS components.
- [`DROP SPATIAL REFERENCE
  SYSTEM`](drop-spatial-reference-system.md "15.1.31 DROP SPATIAL REFERENCE SYSTEM Statement"): See
  [Section 15.1.31, “DROP SPATIAL REFERENCE SYSTEM Statement”](drop-spatial-reference-system.md "15.1.31 DROP SPATIAL REFERENCE SYSTEM Statement").
