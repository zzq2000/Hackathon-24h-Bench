#### 29.12.3.1 The cond\_instances Table

The [`cond_instances`](performance-schema-cond-instances-table.md "29.12.3.1 The cond_instances Table") table lists
all the conditions seen by the Performance Schema while the
server executes. A condition is a synchronization mechanism
used in the code to signal that a specific event has happened,
so that a thread waiting for this condition can resume work.

When a thread is waiting for something to happen, the
condition name is an indication of what the thread is waiting
for, but there is no immediate way to tell which other thread,
or threads, causes the condition to happen.

The [`cond_instances`](performance-schema-cond-instances-table.md "29.12.3.1 The cond_instances Table") table has
these columns:

- `NAME`

  The instrument name associated with the condition.
- `OBJECT_INSTANCE_BEGIN`

  The address in memory of the instrumented condition.

The [`cond_instances`](performance-schema-cond-instances-table.md "29.12.3.1 The cond_instances Table") table has
these indexes:

- Primary key on (`OBJECT_INSTANCE_BEGIN`)
- Index on (`NAME`)

[`TRUNCATE TABLE`](truncate-table.md "15.1.37 TRUNCATE TABLE Statement") is not permitted
for the [`cond_instances`](performance-schema-cond-instances-table.md "29.12.3.1 The cond_instances Table") table.
