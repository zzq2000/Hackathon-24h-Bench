### 15.6.1 BEGIN ... END Compound Statement

```sql
[begin_label:] BEGIN
    [statement_list]
END [end_label]
```

[`BEGIN ... END`](begin-end.md "15.6.1 BEGIN ... END Compound Statement")
syntax is used for writing compound statements, which can appear
within stored programs (stored procedures and functions, triggers,
and events). A compound statement can contain multiple statements,
enclosed by the `BEGIN` and
`END` keywords.
*`statement_list`* represents a list of one
or more statements, each terminated by a semicolon
(`;`) statement delimiter. The
*`statement_list`* itself is optional, so
the empty compound statement (`BEGIN END`) is
legal.

[`BEGIN ... END`](begin-end.md "15.6.1 BEGIN ... END Compound Statement")
blocks can be nested.

Use of multiple statements requires that a client is able to send
statement strings containing the `;` statement
delimiter. In the [**mysql**](mysql.md "6.5.1 mysql — The MySQL Command-Line Client") command-line client,
this is handled with the `delimiter` command.
Changing the `;` end-of-statement delimiter (for
example, to `//`) permit `;` to
be used in a program body. For an example, see
[Section 27.1, “Defining Stored Programs”](stored-programs-defining.md "27.1 Defining Stored Programs").

A [`BEGIN ...
END`](begin-end.md "15.6.1 BEGIN ... END Compound Statement") block can be labeled. See
[Section 15.6.2, “Statement Labels”](statement-labels.md "15.6.2 Statement Labels").

The optional `[NOT] ATOMIC` clause is not
supported. This means that no transactional savepoint is set at
the start of the instruction block and the
`BEGIN` clause used in this context has no effect
on the current transaction.

Note

Within all stored programs, the parser treats
[`BEGIN [WORK]`](commit.md "15.3.1 START TRANSACTION, COMMIT, and ROLLBACK Statements")
as the beginning of a
[`BEGIN ...
END`](begin-end.md "15.6.1 BEGIN ... END Compound Statement") block. To begin a transaction in this context, use
[`START
TRANSACTION`](commit.md "15.3.1 START TRANSACTION, COMMIT, and ROLLBACK Statements") instead.
