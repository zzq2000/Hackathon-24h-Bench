### 17.8.6 Using Asynchronous I/O on Linux

`InnoDB` uses the asynchronous I/O subsystem
(native AIO) on Linux to perform read-ahead and write requests for
data file pages. This behavior is controlled by the
[`innodb_use_native_aio`](innodb-parameters.md#sysvar_innodb_use_native_aio)
configuration option, which applies to Linux systems only and is
enabled by default. On other Unix-like systems,
`InnoDB` uses synchronous I/O only. Historically,
`InnoDB` only used asynchronous I/O on Windows
systems. Using the asynchronous I/O subsystem on Linux requires
the `libaio` library.

With synchronous I/O, query threads queue I/O requests, and
`InnoDB` background threads retrieve the queued
requests one at a time, issuing a synchronous I/O call for each.
When an I/O request is completed and the I/O call returns, the
`InnoDB` background thread that is handling the
request calls an I/O completion routine and returns to process the
next request. The number of requests that can be processed in
parallel is *`n`*, where
*`n`* is the number of
`InnoDB` background threads. The number of
`InnoDB` background threads is controlled by
[`innodb_read_io_threads`](innodb-parameters.md#sysvar_innodb_read_io_threads) and
[`innodb_write_io_threads`](innodb-parameters.md#sysvar_innodb_write_io_threads). See
[Section 17.8.5, “Configuring the Number of Background InnoDB I/O Threads”](innodb-performance-multiple_io_threads.md "17.8.5 Configuring the Number of Background InnoDB I/O Threads").

With native AIO, query threads dispatch I/O requests directly to
the operating system, thereby removing the limit imposed by the
number of background threads. `InnoDB` background
threads wait for I/O events to signal completed requests. When a
request is completed, a background thread calls an I/O completion
routine and resumes waiting for I/O events.

The advantage of native AIO is scalability for heavily I/O-bound
systems that typically show many pending reads/writes in
`SHOW ENGINE INNODB STATUS\G` output. The
increase in parallel processing when using native AIO means that
the type of I/O scheduler or properties of the disk array
controller have a greater influence on I/O performance.

A potential disadvantage of native AIO for heavily I/O-bound
systems is lack of control over the number of I/O write requests
dispatched to the operating system at once. Too many I/O write
requests dispatched to the operating system for parallel
processing could, in some cases, result in I/O read starvation,
depending on the amount of I/O activity and system capabilities.

If a problem with the asynchronous I/O subsystem in the OS
prevents `InnoDB` from starting, you can start
the server with
[`innodb_use_native_aio=0`](innodb-parameters.md#sysvar_innodb_use_native_aio). This
option may also be disabled automatically during startup if
`InnoDB` detects a potential problem such as a
combination of `tmpdir` location,
`tmpfs` file system, and Linux kernel that does
not support asynchronous I/O on `tmpfs`.
