[`CHANGE MASTER TO`](change-master-to.md "15.4.2.1 CHANGE MASTER TO Statement") changes the
parameters that the replica server uses for connecting to the
source and for reading data from the source. It also updates the
contents of the replication metadata repositories (see
[Section 19.2.4, “Relay Log and Replication Metadata Repositories”](replica-logs.md "19.2.4 Relay Log and Replication Metadata Repositories")). From MySQL 8.0.23, use
[`CHANGE REPLICATION SOURCE TO`](change-replication-source-to.md "15.4.2.3 CHANGE REPLICATION SOURCE TO Statement") in
place of [`CHANGE MASTER
TO`](change-master-to.md "15.4.2.1 CHANGE MASTER TO Statement"), which is deprecated from that release. In releases
before MySQL 8.0.23, use [`CHANGE MASTER
TO`](change-master-to.md "15.4.2.1 CHANGE MASTER TO Statement").

[`CHANGE MASTER TO`](change-master-to.md "15.4.2.1 CHANGE MASTER TO Statement") requires the
[`REPLICATION_SLAVE_ADMIN`](privileges-provided.md#priv_replication-slave-admin) privilege
(or the deprecated [`SUPER`](privileges-provided.md#priv_super)
privilege).

Options that you do not specify on a [`CHANGE
MASTER TO`](change-master-to.md "15.4.2.1 CHANGE MASTER TO Statement") statement retain their value, except as
indicated in the following discussion. In most cases, there is
therefore no need to specify options that do not change.

Values used for `SOURCE_HOST` and other
[`CHANGE REPLICATION SOURCE TO`](change-replication-source-to.md "15.4.2.3 CHANGE REPLICATION SOURCE TO Statement")
options are checked for linefeed (`\n` or
`0x0A`) characters. The presence of such
characters in these values causes the statement to fail with an
error.

The optional `FOR CHANNEL
channel` clause enables you
to name which replication channel the statement applies to.
Providing a `FOR CHANNEL
channel` clause applies the
`CHANGE MASTER TO` statement to a specific
replication channel, and is used to add a new channel or modify
an existing channel. For example, to add a new channel called
`channel2`:

```sql
CHANGE MASTER TO MASTER_HOST=host1, MASTER_PORT=3002 FOR CHANNEL 'channel2'
```

If no clause is named and no extra channels exist, a
[`CHANGE MASTER TO`](change-master-to.md "15.4.2.1 CHANGE MASTER TO Statement") statement
applies to the default channel, whose name is the empty string
(""). When you have set up multiple replication channels, every
[`CHANGE MASTER TO`](change-master-to.md "15.4.2.1 CHANGE MASTER TO Statement") statement must
name a channel using the `FOR CHANNEL
channel` clause. See
[Section 19.2.2, “Replication Channels”](replication-channels.md "19.2.2 Replication Channels") for more information.

For some of the options of the [`CHANGE
MASTER TO`](change-master-to.md "15.4.2.1 CHANGE MASTER TO Statement") statement, you must issue a
[`STOP
SLAVE`](stop-replica.md "15.4.2.8 STOP REPLICA Statement") statement prior to issuing a
[`CHANGE MASTER TO`](change-master-to.md "15.4.2.1 CHANGE MASTER TO Statement") statement (and a
[`START
SLAVE`](start-replica.md "15.4.2.6 START REPLICA Statement") statement afterwards). Sometimes, you only need
to stop the replication SQL (applier) thread or the replication
I/O (receiver) thread, not both:

- When the applier thread is stopped, you can execute
  [`CHANGE MASTER TO`](change-master-to.md "15.4.2.1 CHANGE MASTER TO Statement") using any
  combination that is otherwise allowed of
  `RELAY_LOG_FILE`,
  `RELAY_LOG_POS`, and
  `MASTER_DELAY` options, even if the
  replication receiver thread is running. No other options may
  be used with this statement when the receiver thread is
  running.
- When the receiver thread is stopped, you can execute
  [`CHANGE MASTER TO`](change-master-to.md "15.4.2.1 CHANGE MASTER TO Statement") using any of
  the options for this statement (in any allowed combination)
  *except*
  `RELAY_LOG_FILE`,
  `RELAY_LOG_POS`,
  `MASTER_DELAY`, or
  `MASTER_AUTO_POSITION = 1` even when the
  applier thread is running.
- Both the receiver thread and the applier thread must be
  stopped before issuing a [`CHANGE MASTER
  TO`](change-master-to.md "15.4.2.1 CHANGE MASTER TO Statement") statement that employs
  `MASTER_AUTO_POSITION = 1`,
  `GTID_ONLY = 1`, or
  `ASSIGN_GTIDS_TO_ANONYMOUS_TRANSACTIONS`.

You can check the current state of the replication applier
thread and replication receiver thread using
[`SHOW SLAVE
STATUS`](show-replica-status.md "15.7.7.35 SHOW REPLICA STATUS Statement"). Note that the Group Replication applier
channel (`group_replication_applier`) has no
receiver thread, only an applier thread.

[`CHANGE MASTER TO`](change-master-to.md "15.4.2.1 CHANGE MASTER TO Statement") statements have
a number of side-effects and interactions that you should be
aware of beforehand:

- [`CHANGE MASTER TO`](change-master-to.md "15.4.2.1 CHANGE MASTER TO Statement") causes an
  implicit commit of an ongoing transaction. See
  [Section 15.3.3, “Statements That Cause an Implicit Commit”](implicit-commit.md "15.3.3 Statements That Cause an Implicit Commit").
- [`CHANGE MASTER TO`](change-master-to.md "15.4.2.1 CHANGE MASTER TO Statement") causes the
  previous values for `MASTER_HOST`,
  `MASTER_PORT`,
  `MASTER_LOG_FILE`, and
  `MASTER_LOG_POS` to be written to the error
  log, along with other information about the replica's
  state prior to execution.
- If you are using statement-based replication and temporary
  tables, it is possible for a [`CHANGE
  MASTER TO`](change-master-to.md "15.4.2.1 CHANGE MASTER TO Statement") statement following a
  [`STOP
  SLAVE`](stop-replica.md "15.4.2.8 STOP REPLICA Statement") statement to leave behind temporary tables
  on the replica. A warning
  ([`ER_WARN_OPEN_TEMP_TABLES_MUST_BE_ZERO`](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/mysql-errors/8.0/en/server-error-reference.html#error_er_warn_open_temp_tables_must_be_zero))
  is issued whenever this occurs. You can avoid this in such
  cases by making sure that the value of the
  [`Replica_open_temp_tables`](server-status-variables.md#statvar_Replica_open_temp_tables)
  or [`Slave_open_temp_tables`](server-status-variables.md#statvar_Slave_open_temp_tables)
  system status variable is equal to 0 prior to executing such
  a [`CHANGE MASTER TO`](change-master-to.md "15.4.2.1 CHANGE MASTER TO Statement") statement.
- When using a multithreaded replica
  ([`replica_parallel_workers`](replication-options-replica.md#sysvar_replica_parallel_workers) >
  0 or [`slave_parallel_workers`](replication-options-replica.md#sysvar_slave_parallel_workers)
  > 0), stopping the replica can cause gaps in the sequence of
  transactions that have been executed from the relay log,
  regardless of whether the replica was stopped intentionally
  or otherwise. When such gaps exist, issuing
  [`CHANGE MASTER TO`](change-master-to.md "15.4.2.1 CHANGE MASTER TO Statement") fails. The
  solution in this situation is to issue
  [`START SLAVE
  UNTIL SQL_AFTER_MTS_GAPS`](start-replica.md "15.4.2.6 START REPLICA Statement") which ensures that the
  gaps are closed. From MySQL 8.0.26, the process of checking
  for gaps in the sequence of transactions is skipped entirely
  when GTID-based replication and GTID auto-positioning are in
  use, because gaps in transactions can be resolved using GTID
  auto-positioning. In that situation,
  [`CHANGE MASTER
  TO`](change-master-to.md "15.4.2.1 CHANGE MASTER TO Statement") can still be used.

The following options are available for
[`CHANGE MASTER TO`](change-master-to.md "15.4.2.1 CHANGE MASTER TO Statement") statements:

`ASSIGN_GTIDS_TO_ANONYMOUS_TRANSACTIONS = {OFF | LOCAL | uuid}`
:   Makes the replication channel assign a GTID to replicated
    transactions that do not have one, enabling replication
    from a source that does not use GTID-based replication, to
    a replica that does. For a multi-source replica, you can
    have a mix of channels that use
    `ASSIGN_GTIDS_TO_ANONYMOUS_TRANSACTIONS`,
    and channels that do not. The default is
    `OFF`, meaning that the feature is not
    used.

    `LOCAL` assigns a GTID including the
    replica's own UUID (the
    [`server_uuid`](replication-options.md#sysvar_server_uuid) setting).
    `uuid` assigns
    a GTID including the specified UUID, such as the
    [`server_uuid`](replication-options.md#sysvar_server_uuid)
    setting for the replication source server. Using a
    nonlocal UUID lets you differentiate between transactions
    that originated on the replica and transactions that
    originated on the source, and for a multi-source replica,
    between transactions that originated on different sources.
    The UUID you choose only has significance for the
    replica's own use. If any of the transactions sent by the
    source do have a GTID already, that GTID is retained.

    Channels specific to Group Replication cannot use
    `ASSIGN_GTIDS_TO_ANONYMOUS_TRANSACTIONS`,
    but an asynchronous replication channel for another source
    on a server instance that is a Group Replication group
    member can do so. In that case, do not specify the Group
    Replication group name as the UUID for creating the GTIDs.

    To set
    `ASSIGN_GTIDS_TO_ANONYMOUS_TRANSACTIONS`
    to `LOCAL` or
    `uuid`, the
    replica must have
    [`gtid_mode=ON`](replication-options-gtids.md#sysvar_gtid_mode) set, and
    this cannot be changed afterwards. This option is for use
    with a source that has binary log file position based
    replication, so `MASTER_AUTO_POSITION=1`
    cannot be set for the channel. Both the replication SQL
    thread and the replication I/O (receiver) thread must be
    stopped before setting this option.

    Important

    A replica set up with
    `ASSIGN_GTIDS_TO_ANONYMOUS_TRANSACTIONS`
    on any channel cannot be promoted to replace the
    replication source server in the event that a failover
    is required, and a backup taken from the replica cannot
    be used to restore the replication source server. The
    same restriction applies to replacing or restoring other
    replicas that use
    `ASSIGN_GTIDS_TO_ANONYMOUS_TRANSACTIONS`
    on any channel.

    For further restrictions and information, see
    [Section 19.1.3.6, “Replication From a Source Without GTIDs to a Replica With GTIDs”](replication-gtids-assign-anon.md "19.1.3.6 Replication From a Source Without GTIDs to a Replica With GTIDs").

`GET_MASTER_PUBLIC_KEY = {0|1}`
:   Enables RSA key pair-based password exchange by requesting
    the public key from the source. The option is disabled by
    default.

    This option applies to replicas that authenticate with the
    `caching_sha2_password` authentication
    plugin. For connections by accounts that authenticate
    using this plugin, the source does not send the public key
    unless requested, so it must be requested or specified in
    the client. If `MASTER_PUBLIC_KEY_PATH`
    is given and specifies a valid public key file, it takes
    precedence over `GET_MASTER_PUBLIC_KEY`.
    If you are using a replication user account that
    authenticates with the
    `caching_sha2_password` plugin (which is
    the default from MySQL 8.0), and you are not using a
    secure connection, you must specify either this option or
    the `MASTER_PUBLIC_KEY_PATH` option to
    provide the RSA public key to the replica.

`GTID_ONLY = {0|1}`
:   Stops the replication channel persisting file names and
    file positions in the replication metadata repositories.
    `GTID_ONLY` is available as of MySQL
    8.0.27. The `GTID_ONLY` option is
    disabled by default for asynchronous replication channels,
    but it is enabled by default for Group Replication
    channels, and it cannot be disabled for them.

    For replication channels with this setting, in-memory file
    positions are still tracked, and file positions can still
    be observed for debugging purposes in error messages and
    through interfaces such as `SHOW REPLICA
    STATUS` statements (where they are shown as being
    invalid if they are out of date). However, the writes and
    reads required to persist and check the file positions are
    avoided in situations where GTID-based replication does
    not actually require them, including the transaction
    queuing and application process.

    This option can be used only if both the replication SQL
    (applier) thread and replication I/O (receiver) thread are
    stopped. To set `GTID_ONLY = 1` for a
    replication channel, GTIDs must be in use on the server
    ([`gtid_mode =
    ON`](replication-options-gtids.md#sysvar_gtid_mode)), and row-based binary logging must be in use
    on the source (statement-based replication is not
    supported). The options `REQUIRE_ROW_FORMAT =
    1` and `SOURCE_AUTO_POSITION =
    1` must be set for the replication channel.

    When `GTID_ONLY = 1` is set, the replica
    uses
    [`replica_parallel_workers=1`](replication-options-replica.md#sysvar_replica_parallel_workers)
    if that system variable is set to zero for the server, so
    it is always technically a multi-threaded applier. This is
    because a multi-threaded applier uses saved positions
    rather than the replication metadata repositories to
    locate the start of a transaction that it needs to
    reapply.

    If you disable `GTID_ONLY` after setting
    it, the existing relay logs are deleted and the existing
    known binary log file positions are persisted, even if
    they are stale. The file positions for the binary log and
    relay log in the replication metadata repositories might
    be invalid, and a warning is returned if this is the case.
    Provided that `SOURCE_AUTO_POSITION` is
    still enabled, GTID auto-positioning is used to provide
    the correct positioning.

    If you also disable
    `SOURCE_AUTO_POSITION`, the file
    positions for the binary log and relay log in the
    replication metadata repositories are used for positioning
    if they are valid. If they are marked as invalid, you must
    provide a valid binary log file name and position
    (`SOURCE_LOG_FILE` and
    `SOURCE_LOG_POS`). If you also provide a
    relay log file name and position
    (`RELAY_LOG_FILE` and
    `RELAY_LOG_POS`), the relay logs are
    preserved and the applier position is set to the stated
    position. GTID auto-skip ensures that any transactions
    already applied are skipped even if the eventual applier
    position is not correct.

`IGNORE_SERVER_IDS = (server_id_list)`
:   Makes the replica ignore events originating from the
    specified servers. The option takes a comma-separated list
    of 0 or more server IDs. Log rotation and deletion events
    from the servers are not ignored, and are recorded in the
    relay log.

    In circular replication, the originating server normally
    acts as the terminator of its own events, so that they are
    not applied more than once. Thus, this option is useful in
    circular replication when one of the servers in the circle
    is removed. Suppose that you have a circular replication
    setup with 4 servers, having server IDs 1, 2, 3, and 4,
    and server 3 fails. When bridging the gap by starting
    replication from server 2 to server 4, you can include
    `IGNORE_SERVER_IDS = (3)` in the
    [`CHANGE MASTER TO`](change-master-to.md "15.4.2.1 CHANGE MASTER TO Statement") statement
    that you issue on server 4 to tell it to use server 2 as
    its source instead of server 3. Doing so causes it to
    ignore and not to propagate any statements that originated
    with the server that is no longer in use.

    If `IGNORE_SERVER_IDS` contains the
    server's own ID and the server was started with the
    [`--replicate-same-server-id`](replication-options-replica.md#option_mysqld_replicate-same-server-id)
    option enabled, an error results.

    Note

    When global transaction identifiers (GTIDs) are used for
    replication, transactions that have already been applied
    are automatically ignored, so the
    `IGNORE_SERVER_IDS` function is not
    required and is deprecated. If
    [`gtid_mode=ON`](replication-options-gtids.md#sysvar_gtid_mode) is set for
    the server, a deprecation warning is issued if you
    include the `IGNORE_SERVER_IDS` option
    in a [`CHANGE MASTER TO`](change-master-to.md "15.4.2.1 CHANGE MASTER TO Statement")
    statement.

    The source metadata repository and the output of
    [`SHOW
    REPLICA STATUS`](show-replica-status.md "15.7.7.35 SHOW REPLICA STATUS Statement") provide the list of servers that
    are currently ignored. For more information, see
    [Section 19.2.4.2, “Replication Metadata Repositories”](replica-logs-status.md "19.2.4.2 Replication Metadata Repositories"), and
    [Section 15.7.7.35, “SHOW REPLICA STATUS Statement”](show-replica-status.md "15.7.7.35 SHOW REPLICA STATUS Statement").

    If a [`CHANGE MASTER TO`](change-master-to.md "15.4.2.1 CHANGE MASTER TO Statement")
    statement is issued without any
    `IGNORE_SERVER_IDS` option, any existing
    list is preserved. To clear the list of ignored servers,
    it is necessary to use the option with an empty list:

    ```sql
    CHANGE MASTER TO IGNORE_SERVER_IDS = ();
    ```

    [`RESET
    REPLICA ALL`](reset-replica.md "15.4.2.4 RESET REPLICA Statement") clears
    `IGNORE_SERVER_IDS`.

    Note

    A deprecation warning is issued if `SET
    GTID_MODE=ON` is issued when any channel has
    existing server IDs set with
    `IGNORE_SERVER_IDS`. Before starting
    GTID-based replication, check for and clear all ignored
    server ID lists on the servers involved. The
    [`SHOW
    REPLICA STATUS`](show-replica-status.md "15.7.7.35 SHOW REPLICA STATUS Statement") statement displays the list of
    ignored IDs, if there is one. If you do receive the
    deprecation warning, you can still clear a list after
    [`gtid_mode=ON`](replication-options-gtids.md#sysvar_gtid_mode) is set by
    issuing a [`CHANGE MASTER
    TO`](change-master-to.md "15.4.2.1 CHANGE MASTER TO Statement") statement containing the
    `IGNORE_SERVER_IDS` option with an
    empty list.

`MASTER_AUTO_POSITION = {0|1}`
:   Makes the replica attempt to connect to the source using
    the auto-positioning feature of GTID-based replication,
    rather than a binary log file based position. This option
    is used to start a replica using GTID-based replication.
    The default is 0, meaning that GTID auto-positioning and
    GTID-based replication are not used. This option can be
    used with `CHANGE MASTER TO` only if both
    the replication SQL (applier) thread and replication I/O
    (receiver) thread are stopped.

    Both the replica and the source must have GTIDs enabled
    ([`GTID_MODE=ON`](replication-options-gtids.md#sysvar_gtid_mode),
    `ON_PERMISSIVE,` or
    `OFF_PERMISSIVE` on the replica, and
    [`GTID_MODE=ON`](replication-options-gtids.md#sysvar_gtid_mode) on the
    source). `MASTER_LOG_FILE`,
    `MASTER_LOG_POS`,
    `RELAY_LOG_FILE`, and
    `RELAY_LOG_POS` cannot be specified
    together with `MASTER_AUTO_POSITION = 1`.
    If multi-source replication is enabled on the replica, you
    need to set the `MASTER_AUTO_POSITION =
    1` option for each applicable replication
    channel.

    With `MASTER_AUTO_POSITION = 1` set, in
    the initial connection handshake, the replica sends a GTID
    set containing the transactions that it has already
    received, committed, or both. The source responds by
    sending all transactions recorded in its binary log whose
    GTID is not included in the GTID set sent by the replica.
    This exchange ensures that the source only sends the
    transactions with a GTID that the replica has not already
    recorded or committed. If the replica receives
    transactions from more than one source, as in the case of
    a diamond topology, the auto-skip function ensures that
    the transactions are not applied twice. For details of how
    the GTID set sent by the replica is computed, see
    [Section 19.1.3.3, “GTID Auto-Positioning”](replication-gtids-auto-positioning.md "19.1.3.3 GTID Auto-Positioning").

    If any of the transactions that should be sent by the
    source have been purged from the source's binary log, or
    added to the set of GTIDs in the
    [`gtid_purged`](replication-options-gtids.md#sysvar_gtid_purged) system
    variable by another method, the source sends the error
    [`ER_SOURCE_HAS_PURGED_REQUIRED_GTIDS`](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/mysql-errors/8.0/en/server-error-reference.html#error_er_source_has_purged_required_gtids)
    to the replica, and replication does not start. The GTIDs
    of the missing purged transactions are identified and
    listed in the source's error log in the warning message
    [`ER_FOUND_MISSING_GTIDS`](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/mysql-errors/8.0/en/server-error-reference.html#error_er_found_missing_gtids).
    Also, if during the exchange of transactions it is found
    that the replica has recorded or committed transactions
    with the source's UUID in the GTID, but the source itself
    has not committed them, the source sends the error
    [`ER_REPLICA_HAS_MORE_GTIDS_THAN_SOURCE`](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/mysql-errors/8.0/en/server-error-reference.html#error_er_replica_has_more_gtids_than_source)
    to the replica and replication does not start. For
    information on how to handle these situations, see
    [Section 19.1.3.3, “GTID Auto-Positioning”](replication-gtids-auto-positioning.md "19.1.3.3 GTID Auto-Positioning").

    You can see whether replication is running with GTID
    auto-positioning enabled by checking the Performance
    Schema
    [`replication_connection_status`](performance-schema-replication-connection-status-table.md "29.12.11.11 The replication_connection_status Table")
    table or the output of
    [`SHOW
    REPLICA STATUS`](show-replica-status.md "15.7.7.35 SHOW REPLICA STATUS Statement"). Disabling the
    `MASTER_AUTO_POSITION` option again makes
    the replica revert to file-based replication.

`MASTER_BIND = 'interface_name'`
:   Determines which of the replica's network interfaces is
    chosen for connecting to the source, for use on replicas
    that have multiple network interfaces. Specify the IP
    address of the network interface. The maximum length of
    the string value is 255 characters.

    The IP address configured with this option, if any, can be
    seen in the `Master_Bind` column of the
    output from
    [`SHOW
    REPLICA STATUS`](show-replica-status.md "15.7.7.35 SHOW REPLICA STATUS Statement"). In the source metadata
    repository table
    `mysql.slave_master_info`, the value can
    be seen as the `Master_bind` column. The
    ability to bind a replica to a specific network interface
    is also supported by NDB Cluster.

`MASTER_COMPRESSION_ALGORITHMS = 'algorithm[,algorithm][,algorithm]'`
:   Specifies one, two, or three of the permitted compression
    algorithms for connections to the replication source
    server, separated by commas. The maximum length of the
    string value is 99 characters. The default value is
    `uncompressed`.

    The available algorithms are `zlib`,
    `zstd`, and
    `uncompressed`, the same as for the
    [`protocol_compression_algorithms`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_protocol_compression_algorithms)
    system variable. The algorithms can be specified in any
    order, but it is not an order of preference - the
    algorithm negotiation process attempts to use
    `zlib`, then `zstd`,
    then `uncompressed`, if they are
    specified.
    `MASTER_COMPRESSION_ALGORITHMS` is
    available as of MySQL 8.0.18.

    The value of
    `MASTER_COMPRESSION_ALGORITHMS` applies
    only if the
    [`replica_compressed_protocol`](replication-options-replica.md#sysvar_replica_compressed_protocol)
    or
    [`slave_compressed_protocol`](replication-options-replica.md#sysvar_slave_compressed_protocol)
    system variable is disabled. If
    [`replica_compressed_protocol`](replication-options-replica.md#sysvar_replica_compressed_protocol)
    or
    [`slave_compressed_protocol`](replication-options-replica.md#sysvar_slave_compressed_protocol)
    is enabled, it takes precedence over
    `MASTER_COMPRESSION_ALGORITHMS` and
    connections to the source use `zlib`
    compression if both source and replica support that
    algorithm. For more information, see
    [Section 6.2.8, “Connection Compression Control”](connection-compression-control.md "6.2.8 Connection Compression Control").

    Binary log transaction compression (available as of MySQL
    8.0.20), which is activated by the
    [`binlog_transaction_compression`](replication-options-binary-log.md#sysvar_binlog_transaction_compression)
    system variable, can also be used to save bandwidth. If
    you do this in combination with connection compression,
    connection compression has less opportunity to act on the
    data, but can still compress headers and those events and
    transaction payloads that are uncompressed. For more
    information on binary log transaction compression, see
    [Section 7.4.4.5, “Binary Log Transaction Compression”](binary-log-transaction-compression.md "7.4.4.5 Binary Log Transaction Compression").

`MASTER_CONNECT_RETRY = interval`
:   Specifies the interval in seconds between the reconnection
    attempts that the replica makes after the connection to
    the source times out. The default interval is 60.

    The attempts are limited by the
    `MASTER_RETRY_COUNT` option. If both the
    default settings are used, the replica waits 60 seconds
    between reconnection attempts
    (`MASTER_CONNECT_RETRY=60`), and keeps
    attempting to reconnect at this rate for 60 days
    (`MASTER_RETRY_COUNT=86400`). These
    values are recorded in the source metadata repository and
    shown in the
    [`replication_connection_configuration`](performance-schema-replication-connection-configuration-table.md "29.12.11.10 The replication_connection_configuration Table")
    Performance Schema table.

`MASTER_DELAY = interval`
:   Specifies how many seconds behind the source the replica
    must lag. An event received from the source is not
    executed until at least
    *`interval`* seconds later than its
    execution on the source.
    *`interval`* must be a nonnegative
    integer in the range from 0 to
    231−1. The default is 0.
    For more information, see
    [Section 19.4.11, “Delayed Replication”](replication-delayed.md "19.4.11 Delayed Replication").

    A `CHANGE MASTER TO` statement employing
    the `MASTER_DELAY` option can be executed
    on a running replica when the replication SQL thread is
    stopped.

`MASTER_HEARTBEAT_PERIOD = interval`
:   Controls the heartbeat interval, which stops the
    connection timeout occurring in the absence of data if the
    connection is still good. A heartbeat signal is sent to
    the replica after that number of seconds, and the waiting
    period is reset whenever the source's binary log is
    updated with an event. Heartbeats are therefore sent by
    the source only if there are no unsent events in the
    binary log file for a period longer than this.

    The heartbeat interval *`interval`*
    is a decimal value having the range 0 to 4294967 seconds
    and a resolution in milliseconds; the smallest nonzero
    value is 0.001. Setting
    *`interval`* to 0 disables
    heartbeats altogether. The heartbeat interval defaults to
    half the value of the
    [`replica_net_timeout`](replication-options-replica.md#sysvar_replica_net_timeout) or
    [`slave_net_timeout`](replication-options-replica.md#sysvar_slave_net_timeout) system
    variable. It is recorded in the source metadata repository
    and shown in the
    [`replication_connection_configuration`](performance-schema-replication-connection-configuration-table.md "29.12.11.10 The replication_connection_configuration Table")
    Performance Schema table.

    The system variable
    [`replica_net_timeout`](replication-options-replica.md#sysvar_replica_net_timeout) (from
    MySQL 8.0.26) or
    [`slave_net_timeout`](replication-options-replica.md#sysvar_slave_net_timeout) (before
    MySQL 8.0.26) specifies the number of seconds that the
    replica waits for either more data or a heartbeat signal
    from the source, before the replica considers the
    connection broken, aborts the read, and tries to
    reconnect. The default value is 60 seconds (one minute).
    Note that a change to the value or default setting of
    [`replica_net_timeout`](replication-options-replica.md#sysvar_replica_net_timeout) or
    [`slave_net_timeout`](replication-options-replica.md#sysvar_slave_net_timeout) does
    not automatically change the heartbeat interval, whether
    that has been set explicitly or is using a previously
    calculated default. A warning is issued if you set the
    global value of
    [`replica_net_timeout`](replication-options-replica.md#sysvar_replica_net_timeout) or
    `slave_net_timeout` to a value less than
    that of the current heartbeat interval. If
    [`replica_net_timeout`](replication-options-replica.md#sysvar_replica_net_timeout) or
    [`slave_net_timeout`](replication-options-replica.md#sysvar_slave_net_timeout) is
    changed, you must also issue [`CHANGE
    MASTER TO`](change-master-to.md "15.4.2.1 CHANGE MASTER TO Statement") to adjust the heartbeat interval to an
    appropriate value so that the heartbeat signal occurs
    before the connection timeout. If you do not do this, the
    heartbeat signal has no effect, and if no data is received
    from the source, the replica can make repeated
    reconnection attempts, creating zombie dump threads.

`MASTER_HOST = 'host_name'`
:   The host name or IP address of the replication source
    server. The replica uses this to connect to the source.
    The maximum length of the string value is 255 characters.
    Before MySQL 8.0.17 it was 60 characters.

    If you specify `MASTER_HOST` or
    `MASTER_PORT`, the replica assumes that
    the source server is different from before (even if the
    option value is the same as its current value.) In this
    case, the old values for the source's binary log file name
    and position are considered no longer applicable, so if
    you do not specify `MASTER_LOG_FILE` and
    `MASTER_LOG_POS` in the statement,
    `MASTER_LOG_FILE=''` and
    `MASTER_LOG_POS=4` are silently appended
    to it.

    Setting `MASTER_HOST=''` (that is,
    setting its value explicitly to an empty string) is
    *not* the same as not setting
    `MASTER_HOST` at all. Trying to set
    `MASTER_HOST` to an empty string fails
    with an error.

`MASTER_LOG_FILE = 'source_log_name'`, `MASTER_LOG_POS = source_log_pos`
:   The binary log file name, and the location in that file,
    at which the replication I/O (receiver) thread begins
    reading from the source's binary log the next time the
    thread starts. Specify these options if you are using
    binary log file position based replication.

    `MASTER_LOG_FILE` must include the
    numeric suffix of a specific binary log file that is
    available on the source server, for example,
    `MASTER_LOG_FILE='binlog.000145'`. The
    maximum length of the string value is 511 characters.

    `MASTER_LOG_POS` is the numeric position
    for the replica to start reading in that file.
    `MASTER_LOG_POS=4` represents the start
    of the events in a binary log file.

    If you specify either of
    `MASTER_LOG_FILE` or
    `MASTER_LOG_POS`, you cannot specify
    `MASTER_AUTO_POSITION = 1`, which is for
    GTID-based replication.

    If neither of `MASTER_LOG_FILE` or
    `MASTER_LOG_POS` is specified, the
    replica uses the last coordinates of the
    *replication SQL (applier) thread*
    before [`CHANGE MASTER TO`](change-master-to.md "15.4.2.1 CHANGE MASTER TO Statement") was
    issued. This ensures that there is no discontinuity in
    replication, even if the replication SQL (applier) thread
    was late compared to the replication I/O (receiver)
    thread.

`MASTER_PASSWORD = 'password'`
:   The password for the replication user account to use for
    connecting to the replication source server. The maximum
    length of the string value is 32 characters. If you
    specify `MASTER_PASSWORD`,
    `MASTER_USER` is also required.

    The password used for a replication user account in a
    `CHANGE MASTER TO` statement is limited
    to 32 characters in length. Trying to use a password of
    more than 32 characters causes `CHANGE MASTER
    TO` to fail.

    The password is masked in MySQL Server’s logs,
    Performance Schema tables, and [`SHOW
    PROCESSLIST`](show-processlist.md "15.7.7.29 SHOW PROCESSLIST Statement") statements.

`MASTER_PORT = port_num`
:   The TCP/IP port number that the replica uses to connect to
    the replication source server.

    Note

    Replication cannot use Unix socket files. You must be
    able to connect to the replication source server using
    TCP/IP.

    If you specify `MASTER_HOST` or
    `MASTER_PORT`, the replica assumes that
    the source server is different from before (even if the
    option value is the same as its current value). In this
    case, the old values for the source's binary log file name
    and position are considered no longer applicable, so if
    you do not specify `MASTER_LOG_FILE` and
    `MASTER_LOG_POS` in the statement,
    `MASTER_LOG_FILE=''` and
    `MASTER_LOG_POS=4` are silently appended
    to it.

`MASTER_PUBLIC_KEY_PATH = 'key_file_name'`
:   Enables RSA key pair-based password exchange by providing
    the path name to a file containing a replica-side copy of
    the public key required by the source. The file must be in
    PEM format. The maximum length of the string value is 511
    characters.

    This option applies to replicas that authenticate with the
    `sha256_password` or
    `caching_sha2_password` authentication
    plugin. (For `sha256_password`,
    `MASTER_PUBLIC_KEY_PATH` can be used only
    if MySQL was built using OpenSSL.) If you are using a
    replication user account that authenticates with the
    `caching_sha2_password` plugin (which is
    the default from MySQL 8.0), and you are not using a
    secure connection, you must specify either this option or
    the `GET_MASTER_PUBLIC_KEY=1` option to
    provide the RSA public key to the replica.

`MASTER_RETRY_COUNT = count`
:   Sets the maximum number of reconnection attempts that the
    replica makes after the connection to the source times
    out, as determined by the
    [`replica_net_timeout`](replication-options-replica.md#sysvar_replica_net_timeout) or
    [`slave_net_timeout`](replication-options-replica.md#sysvar_slave_net_timeout) system
    variable. If the replica does need to reconnect, the first
    retry occurs immediately after the timeout. The default is
    86400 attempts.

    The interval between the attempts is specified by the
    `MASTER_CONNECT_RETRY` option. If both
    the default settings are used, the replica waits 60
    seconds between reconnection attempts
    (`MASTER_CONNECT_RETRY=60`), and keeps
    attempting to reconnect at this rate for 60 days
    (`MASTER_RETRY_COUNT=86400`). A setting
    of 0 for `MASTER_RETRY_COUNT` means that
    there is no limit on the number of reconnection attempts,
    so the replica keeps trying to reconnect indefinitely.

    The values for `MASTER_CONNECT_RETRY` and
    `MASTER_RETRY_COUNT` are recorded in the
    source metadata repository and shown in the
    [`replication_connection_configuration`](performance-schema-replication-connection-configuration-table.md "29.12.11.10 The replication_connection_configuration Table")
    Performance Schema table.
    `MASTER_RETRY_COUNT` supersedes the
    [`--master-retry-count`](replication-options-replica.md#option_mysqld_master-retry-count) server
    startup option.

`MASTER_SSL = {0|1}`
:   Specify whether the replica encrypts the replication
    connection. The default is 0, meaning that the replica
    does not encrypt the replication connection. If you set
    `MASTER_SSL=1`, you can configure the
    encryption using the
    `MASTER_SSL_xxx`
    and
    `MASTER_TLS_xxx`
    options.

    Setting `MASTER_SSL=1` for a replication
    connection and then setting no further
    `MASTER_SSL_xxx`
    options corresponds to setting
    `--ssl-mode=REQUIRED` for the client, as
    described in
    [Command Options for Encrypted Connections](connection-options.md#encrypted-connection-options "Command Options for Encrypted Connections").
    With `MASTER_SSL=1`, the connection
    attempt only succeeds if an encrypted connection can be
    established. A replication connection does not fall back
    to an unencrypted connection, so there is no setting
    corresponding to the
    `--ssl-mode=PREFERRED` setting for
    replication. If `MASTER_SSL=0` is set,
    this corresponds to
    `--ssl-mode=DISABLED`.

    Important

    To help prevent sophisticated man-in-the-middle attacks,
    it is important for the replica to verify the server’s
    identity. You can specify additional
    `MASTER_SSL_xxx`
    options to correspond to the settings
    `--ssl-mode=VERIFY_CA` and
    `--ssl-mode=VERIFY_IDENTITY`, which are
    a better choice than the default setting to help prevent
    this type of attack. With these settings, the replica
    checks that the server’s certificate is valid, and
    checks that the host name the replica is using matches
    the identity in the server’s certificate. To implement
    one of these levels of verification, you must first
    ensure that the CA certificate for the server is
    reliably available to the replica, otherwise
    availability issues will result. For this reason, they
    are not the default setting.

`MASTER_SSL_xxx`, `MASTER_TLS_xxx`
:   Specify how the replica uses encryption and ciphers to
    secure the replication connection. These options can be
    changed even on replicas that are compiled without SSL
    support. They are saved to the source metadata repository,
    but are ignored if the replica does not have SSL support
    enabled. The maximum length of the value for the
    string-valued
    `MASTER_SSL_xxx`
    and
    `MASTER_TLS_xxx`
    options is 511 characters, with the exception of
    `MASTER_TLS_CIPHERSUITES`, for which it
    is 4000 characters.

    The
    `MASTER_SSL_xxx`
    and
    `MASTER_TLS_xxx`
    options perform the same functions as the
    `--ssl-xxx`
    and
    `--tls-xxx`
    client options described in
    [Command Options for Encrypted Connections](connection-options.md#encrypted-connection-options "Command Options for Encrypted Connections").
    The correspondence between the two sets of options, and
    the use of the
    `MASTER_SSL_xxx`
    and
    `MASTER_TLS_xxx`
    options to set up a secure connection, is explained in
    [Section 19.3.1, “Setting Up Replication to Use Encrypted Connections”](replication-encrypted-connections.md "19.3.1 Setting Up Replication to Use Encrypted Connections").

`MASTER_USER = 'user_name'`
:   The user name for the replication user account to use for
    connecting to the replication source server. The maximum
    length of the string value is 96 characters.

    For Group Replication, this account must exist on every
    member of the replication group. It is used for
    distributed recovery if the XCom communication stack is in
    use for the group, and also used for group communication
    connections if the MySQL communication stack is in use for
    the group. With the MySQL communication stack, the account
    must have the
    [`GROUP_REPLICATION_STREAM`](privileges-provided.md#priv_group-replication-stream)
    permission.

    It is possible to set an empty user name by specifying
    `MASTER_USER=''`, but the replication
    channel cannot be started with an empty user name. In
    releases before MySQL 8.0.21, only set an empty
    `MASTER_USER` user name if you need to
    clear previously used credentials from the replication
    metadata repositories for security purposes. Do not use
    the channel afterwards, due to a bug in these releases
    that can substitute a default user name if an empty user
    name is read from the repositories (for example, during an
    automatic restart of a Group Replication channel). From
    MySQL 8.0.21, it is valid to set an empty
    `MASTER_USER` user name and use the
    channel afterwards if you always provide user credentials
    using the
    [`START
    REPLICA`](start-replica.md "15.4.2.6 START REPLICA Statement") statement or [`START
    GROUP_REPLICATION`](start-group-replication.md "15.4.3.1 START GROUP_REPLICATION Statement") statement that starts the
    replication channel. This approach means that the
    replication channel always needs operator intervention to
    restart, but the user credentials are not recorded in the
    replication metadata repositories.

    Important

    To connect to the source using a replication user
    account that authenticates with the
    `caching_sha2_password` plugin, you
    must either set up a secure connection as described in
    [Section 19.3.1, “Setting Up Replication to Use Encrypted Connections”](replication-encrypted-connections.md "19.3.1 Setting Up Replication to Use Encrypted Connections"), or
    enable the unencrypted connection to support password
    exchange using an RSA key pair. The
    `caching_sha2_password` authentication
    plugin is the default for new users created from MySQL
    8.0 (for details, see
    [Section 8.4.1.2, “Caching SHA-2 Pluggable Authentication”](caching-sha2-pluggable-authentication.md "8.4.1.2 Caching SHA-2 Pluggable Authentication")).
    If the user account that you create or use for
    replication uses this authentication plugin, and you are
    not using a secure connection, you must enable RSA key
    pair-based password exchange for a successful
    connection. You can do this using either the
    `MASTER_PUBLIC_KEY_PATH` option or the
    `GET_MASTER_PUBLIC_KEY=1` option for
    this statement.

`MASTER_ZSTD_COMPRESSION_LEVEL = level`
:   The compression level to use for connections to the
    replication source server that use the
    `zstd` compression algorithm. The
    permitted levels are from 1 to 22, with larger values
    indicating increasing levels of compression. The default
    level is 3.
    `MASTER_ZSTD_COMPRESSION_LEVEL` is
    available as of MySQL 8.0.18.

    The compression level setting has no effect on connections
    that do not use `zstd` compression. For
    more information, see
    [Section 6.2.8, “Connection Compression Control”](connection-compression-control.md "6.2.8 Connection Compression Control").

`NETWORK_NAMESPACE = 'namespace'`
:   The network namespace to use for TCP/IP connections to the
    replication source server or, if the MySQL communication
    stack is in use, for Group Replication’s group
    communication connections. The maximum length of the
    string value is 64 characters. If this option is omitted,
    connections from the replica use the default (global)
    namespace. On platforms that do not implement network
    namespace support, failure occurs when the replica
    attempts to connect to the source. For information about
    network namespaces, see
    [Section 7.1.14, “Network Namespace Support”](network-namespace-support.md "7.1.14 Network Namespace Support").
    `NETWORK_NAMESPACE` is available as of
    MySQL 8.0.22.

`PRIVILEGE_CHECKS_USER = {NULL | 'account'}`
:   Names a user account that supplies a security context for
    the specified channel. `NULL`, which is
    the default, means no security context is used.
    `PRIVILEGE_CHECKS_USER` is available as
    of MySQL 8.0.18.

    The user name and host name for the user account must
    follow the syntax described in
    [Section 8.2.4, “Specifying Account Names”](account-names.md "8.2.4 Specifying Account Names"), and the user must not be
    an anonymous user (with a blank user name) or the
    `CURRENT_USER`. The account must have the
    [`REPLICATION_APPLIER`](privileges-provided.md#priv_replication-applier)
    privilege, plus the required privileges to execute the
    transactions replicated on the channel. For details of the
    privileges required by the account, see
    [Section 19.3.3, “Replication Privilege Checks”](replication-privilege-checks.md "19.3.3 Replication Privilege Checks"). When you
    restart the replication channel, the privilege checks are
    applied from that point on. If you do not specify a
    channel and no other channels exist, the statement is
    applied to the default channel.

    The use of row-based binary logging is strongly
    recommended when `PRIVILEGE_CHECKS_USER`
    is set, and you can set
    `REQUIRE_ROW_FORMAT` to enforce this. For
    example, to start privilege checks on the channel
    `channel_1` on a running replica, issue
    the following statements:

    ```sql
    mysql> STOP REPLICA FOR CHANNEL 'channel_1';
    mysql> CHANGE MASTER TO
             PRIVILEGE_CHECKS_USER = 'priv_repl'@'%.example.com',
             REQUIRE_ROW_FORMAT = 1,
             FOR CHANNEL 'channel_1';
    mysql> START REPLICA FOR CHANNEL 'channel_1';
    ```

    For releases from MySQL 8.0.22, use `START
    REPLICA` and `STOP REPLICA`, and
    for releases before MySQL 8.0.22, use `START
    SLAVE` and `STOP SLAVE`. The
    statements work in the same way, only the terminology has
    changed.

`RELAY_LOG_FILE = 'relay_log_file'` , `RELAY_LOG_POS = 'relay_log_pos'`
:   The relay log file name, and the location in that file, at
    which the replication SQL thread begins reading from the
    replica's relay log the next time the thread starts.
    `RELAY_LOG_FILE` can use either an
    absolute or relative path, and uses the same base name as
    `MASTER_LOG_FILE`. The maximum length of
    the string value is 511 characters.

    A `CHANGE MASTER TO` statement using
    `RELAY_LOG_FILE`,
    `RELAY_LOG_POS`, or both options can be
    executed on a running replica when the replication SQL
    thread is stopped. Relay logs are preserved if at least
    one of the replication SQL (applier) thread and the
    replication I/O (receiver) thread is running. If both
    threads are stopped, all relay log files are deleted
    unless at least one of `RELAY_LOG_FILE`
    or `RELAY_LOG_POS` is specified. For the
    Group Replication applier channel
    (`group_replication_applier`), which only
    has an applier thread and no receiver thread, this is the
    case if the applier thread is stopped, but with that
    channel you cannot use the
    `RELAY_LOG_FILE` and
    `RELAY_LOG_POS` options.

`REQUIRE_ROW_FORMAT = {0|1}`
:   Permits only row-based replication events to be processed
    by the replication channel. This option prevents the
    replication applier from taking actions such as creating
    temporary tables and executing `LOAD DATA
    INFILE` requests, which increases the security of
    the channel. The `REQUIRE_ROW_FORMAT`
    option is disabled by default for asynchronous replication
    channels, but it is enabled by default for Group
    Replication channels, and it cannot be disabled for them.
    For more information, see
    [Section 19.3.3, “Replication Privilege Checks”](replication-privilege-checks.md "19.3.3 Replication Privilege Checks").
    `REQUIRE_ROW_FORMAT` is available as of
    MySQL 8.0.19.

`REQUIRE_TABLE_PRIMARY_KEY_CHECK = {STREAM | ON | OFF}`
:   Enables a replica to select its own policy for primary key
    checks. The default is `STREAM`.
    `REQUIRE_TABLE_PRIMARY_KEY_CHECK` is
    available as of MySQL 8.0.20.

    When the option is set to `ON` for a
    replication channel, the replica always uses the value
    `ON` for the
    [`sql_require_primary_key`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_sql_require_primary_key)
    system variable in replication operations, requiring a
    primary key. When the option is set to
    `OFF`, the replica always uses the value
    `OFF` for the
    [`sql_require_primary_key`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_sql_require_primary_key)
    system variable in replication operations, so that a
    primary key is never required, even if the source required
    one. When the
    `REQUIRE_TABLE_PRIMARY_KEY_CHECK` option
    is set to `STREAM`, which is the default,
    the replica uses whatever value is replicated from the
    source for each transaction.

    For multisource replication, setting
    `REQUIRE_TABLE_PRIMARY_KEY_CHECK` to
    `ON` or `OFF` enables a
    replica to normalize behavior across the replication
    channels for different sources, and keep a consistent
    setting for the
    [`sql_require_primary_key`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_sql_require_primary_key)
    system variable. Using `ON` safeguards
    against the accidental loss of primary keys when multiple
    sources update the same set of tables. Using
    `OFF` allows sources that can manipulate
    primary keys to work alongside sources that cannot.

    When `PRIVILEGE_CHECKS_USER` is set,
    setting `REQUIRE_TABLE_PRIMARY_KEY_CHECK`
    to `ON` or `OFF` means
    that the user account does not need session administration
    level privileges to set restricted session variables,
    which are required to change the value of
    [`sql_require_primary_key`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_sql_require_primary_key)
    to match the source's setting for each transaction. For
    more information, see
    [Section 19.3.3, “Replication Privilege Checks”](replication-privilege-checks.md "19.3.3 Replication Privilege Checks").

`SOURCE_CONNECTION_AUTO_FAILOVER = {0|1}`
:   Activates the asynchronous connection failover mechanism
    for a replication channel if one or more alternative
    replication source servers are available (so when there
    are multiple MySQL servers or groups of servers that share
    the replicated data).
    `SOURCE_CONNECTION_AUTO_FAILOVER` is
    available as of MySQL 8.0.22. The default is 0, meaning
    that the mechanism is not activated. For full information
    and instructions to set up this feature, see
    [Section 19.4.9.2, “Asynchronous Connection Failover for Replicas”](replication-asynchronous-connection-failover-replica.md "19.4.9.2 Asynchronous Connection Failover for Replicas").

    The asynchronous connection failover mechanism takes over
    after the reconnection attempts controlled by
    `MASTER_CONNECT_RETRY` and
    `MASTER_RETRY_COUNT` are exhausted. It
    reconnects the replica to an alternative source chosen
    from a specified source list, which you manage using the
    [`asynchronous_connection_failover_add_source`](replication-functions-async-failover.md#function_asynchronous-connection-failover-add-source)
    and
    [`asynchronous_connection_failover_delete_source`](replication-functions-async-failover.md#function_asynchronous-connection-failover-delete-source)
    functions. To add and remove managed groups of servers,
    use the
    [`asynchronous_connection_failover_add_managed`](replication-functions-async-failover.md#function_asynchronous-connection-failover-add-managed)
    and
    [`asynchronous_connection_failover_delete_managed`](replication-functions-async-failover.md#function_asynchronous-connection-failover-delete-managed)
    functions instead. For more information, see
    [Section 19.4.9, “Switching Sources and Replicas with Asynchronous Connection Failover”](replication-asynchronous-connection-failover.md "19.4.9 Switching Sources and Replicas with Asynchronous Connection Failover").

    Important

    1. You can only set
       `SOURCE_CONNECTION_AUTO_FAILOVER =
       1` when GTID auto-positioning is in use
       (`MASTER_AUTO_POSITION = 1`).
    2. When you set
       `SOURCE_CONNECTION_AUTO_FAILOVER =
       1`, set
       `MASTER_RETRY_COUNT` and
       `MASTER_CONNECT_RETRY` to minimal
       numbers that just allow a few retry attempts with
       the same source in a short time, in case the
       connection failure is caused by a transient network
       outage. Otherwise the asynchronous connection
       failover mechanism cannot be activated promptly.
       Suitable values are
       `MASTER_RETRY_COUNT=3` and
       `MASTER_CONNECT_RETRY=10`, which
       make the replica retry the connection 3 times with
       10-second intervals between.
    3. When you set
       `SOURCE_CONNECTION_AUTO_FAILOVER =
       1`, the replication metadata repositories
       must contain the credentials for a replication user
       account that can be used to connect to all the
       servers on the source list for the replication
       channel. These credentials can be set using the
       [`CHANGE REPLICATION SOURCE
       TO`](change-replication-source-to.md "15.4.2.3 CHANGE REPLICATION SOURCE TO Statement") statement with the
       `MASTER_USER` and
       `MASTER_PASSWORD` options. For more
       information, see
       [Section 19.4.9, “Switching Sources and Replicas with Asynchronous Connection Failover”](replication-asynchronous-connection-failover.md "19.4.9 Switching Sources and Replicas with Asynchronous Connection Failover").
    4. From MySQL 8.0.27, when you set
       `SOURCE_CONNECTION_AUTO_FAILOVER =
       1`, asynchronous connection failover for
       replicas is automatically activated if this
       replication channel is on a Group Replication
       primary in a group in single-primary mode. With this
       function active, if the primary that is replicating
       goes offline or into an error state, the new primary
       starts replication on the same channel when it is
       elected. If you want to use the function, this
       replication channel must also be set up on all the
       secondary servers in the replication group, and on
       any new joining members. (If the servers are
       provisioned using MySQL’s clone functionality,
       this all happens automatically.) If you do not want
       to use the function, disable it by using the
       [`group_replication_disable_member_action`](group-replication-functions-for-member-actions.md#function_group-replication-disable-member-action)
       function to disable the Group Replication member
       action
       `mysql_start_failover_channels_if_primary`,
       which is enabled by default. For more information,
       see
       [Section 19.4.9.2, “Asynchronous Connection Failover for Replicas”](replication-asynchronous-connection-failover-replica.md "19.4.9.2 Asynchronous Connection Failover for Replicas").

##### Examples

[`CHANGE MASTER TO`](change-master-to.md "15.4.2.1 CHANGE MASTER TO Statement") is
useful for setting up a replica when you have the snapshot of
the source and have recorded the source's binary log
coordinates corresponding to the time of the snapshot. After
loading the snapshot into the replica to synchronize it with
the source, you can run `CHANGE MASTER TO
MASTER_LOG_FILE='log_name',
MASTER_LOG_POS=log_pos` on
the replica to specify the coordinates at which the replica
should begin reading the source's binary log. The following
example changes the source server the replica uses and
establishes the source's binary log coordinates from which the
replica begins reading:

```sql
CHANGE MASTER TO
  MASTER_HOST='source2.example.com',
  MASTER_USER='replication',
  MASTER_PASSWORD='password',
  MASTER_PORT=3306,
  MASTER_LOG_FILE='source2-bin.001',
  MASTER_LOG_POS=4,
  MASTER_CONNECT_RETRY=10;
```

For the procedure to switch an existing replica to a new
source during failover, see
[Section 19.4.8, “Switching Sources During Failover”](replication-solutions-switch.md "19.4.8 Switching Sources During Failover").

When GTIDs are in use on the source and the replica, specify
GTID auto-positioning instead of giving the binary log file
position, as in the following example. For full instructions
to configure and start GTID-based replication on new or
stopped servers, online servers, or additional replicas, see
[Section 19.1.3, “Replication with Global Transaction Identifiers”](replication-gtids.md "19.1.3 Replication with Global Transaction Identifiers").

```sql
CHANGE MASTER TO
  MASTER_HOST='source3.example.com',
  MASTER_USER='replication',
  MASTER_PASSWORD='password',
  MASTER_PORT=3306,
  MASTER_AUTO_POSITION = 1,
  FOR CHANNEL "source_3";
```

In this example, multi-source replication is in use, and the
[`CHANGE MASTER TO`](change-master-to.md "15.4.2.1 CHANGE MASTER TO Statement") statement is
applied to the replication channel
`"source_3"` that connects the replica to the
specified host. For guidance on setting up multi-source
replication, see [Section 19.1.5, “MySQL Multi-Source Replication”](replication-multi-source.md "19.1.5 MySQL Multi-Source Replication").

The next example shows how to make the replica apply
transactions from relay log files that you want to repeat. To
do this, the source need not be reachable. You can use
[`CHANGE MASTER TO`](change-master-to.md "15.4.2.1 CHANGE MASTER TO Statement") to locate the
relay log position where you want the replica to start
reapplying transactions, and then start the SQL thread:

```sql
CHANGE MASTER TO
  RELAY_LOG_FILE='replica-relay-bin.006',
  RELAY_LOG_POS=4025;
START SLAVE SQL_THREAD;
```

[`CHANGE MASTER TO`](change-master-to.md "15.4.2.1 CHANGE MASTER TO Statement") can also be
used to skip over transactions in the binary log that are
causing replication to stop. The appropriate method to do this
depends on whether GTIDs are in use or not. For instructions
to skip transactions using [`CHANGE MASTER
TO`](change-master-to.md "15.4.2.1 CHANGE MASTER TO Statement") or another method, see
[Section 19.1.7.3, “Skipping Transactions”](replication-administration-skip.md "19.1.7.3 Skipping Transactions").
