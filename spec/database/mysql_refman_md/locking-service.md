#### 7.6.9.1 The Locking Service

MySQL distributions provide a locking interface that is
accessible at two levels:

- At the SQL level, as a set of loadable functions that each
  map onto calls to the service routines.
- As a C language interface, callable as a plugin service from
  server plugins or loadable functions.

For general information about plugin services, see
[Section 7.6.9, “MySQL Plugin Services”](plugin-services.md "7.6.9 MySQL Plugin Services"). For general information about
loadable functions, see
[Adding a Loadable Function](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/extending-mysql/8.0/en/adding-loadable-function.html).

The locking interface has these characteristics:

- Locks have three attributes: Lock namespace, lock name, and
  lock mode:

  - Locks are identified by the combination of namespace and
    lock name. The namespace enables different applications
    to use the same lock names without colliding by creating
    locks in separate namespaces. For example, if
    applications A and B use namespaces of
    `ns1` and `ns2`,
    respectively, each application can use lock names
    `lock1` and `lock2`
    without interfering with the other application.
  - A lock mode is either read or write. Read locks are
    shared: If a session has a read lock on a given lock
    identifier, other sessions can acquire a read lock on
    the same identifier. Write locks are exclusive: If a
    session has a write lock on a given lock identifier,
    other sessions cannot acquire a read or write lock on
    the same identifier.
- Namespace and lock names must be
  non-`NULL`, nonempty, and have a maximum
  length of 64 characters. A namespace or lock name specified
  as `NULL`, the empty string, or a string
  longer than 64 characters results in an
  [`ER_LOCKING_SERVICE_WRONG_NAME`](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/mysql-errors/8.0/en/server-error-reference.html#error_er_locking_service_wrong_name)
  error.
- The locking interface treats namespace and lock names as
  binary strings, so comparisons are case-sensitive.
- The locking interface provides functions to acquire locks
  and release locks. No special privilege is required to call
  these functions. Privilege checking is the responsibility of
  the calling application.
- Locks can be waited for if not immediately available. Lock
  acquisition calls take an integer timeout value that
  indicates how many seconds to wait to acquire locks before
  giving up. If the timeout is reached without successful lock
  acquisition, an
  [`ER_LOCKING_SERVICE_TIMEOUT`](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/mysql-errors/8.0/en/server-error-reference.html#error_er_locking_service_timeout)
  error occurs. If the timeout is 0, there is no waiting and
  the call produces an error if locks cannot be acquired
  immediately.
- The locking interface detects deadlock between
  lock-acquisition calls in different sessions. In this case,
  the locking service chooses a caller and terminates its
  lock-acquisition request with an
  [`ER_LOCKING_SERVICE_DEADLOCK`](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/mysql-errors/8.0/en/server-error-reference.html#error_er_locking_service_deadlock)
  error. This error does not cause transactions to roll back.
  To choose a session in case of deadlock, the locking service
  prefers sessions that hold read locks over sessions that
  hold write locks.
- A session can acquire multiple locks with a single
  lock-acquisition call. For a given call, lock acquisition is
  atomic: The call succeeds if all locks are acquired. If
  acquisition of any lock fails, the call acquires no locks
  and fails, typically with an
  [`ER_LOCKING_SERVICE_TIMEOUT`](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/mysql-errors/8.0/en/server-error-reference.html#error_er_locking_service_timeout)
  or
  [`ER_LOCKING_SERVICE_DEADLOCK`](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/mysql-errors/8.0/en/server-error-reference.html#error_er_locking_service_deadlock)
  error.
- A session can acquire multiple locks for the same lock
  identifier (namespace and lock name combination). These lock
  instances can be read locks, write locks, or a mix of both.
- Locks acquired within a session are released explicitly by
  calling a release-locks function, or implicitly when the
  session terminates (either normally or abnormally). Locks
  are not released when transactions commit or roll back.
- Within a session, all locks for a given namespace when
  released are released together.

The interface provided by the locking service is distinct from
that provided by [`GET_LOCK()`](locking-functions.md#function_get-lock) and
related SQL functions (see [Section 14.14, “Locking Functions”](locking-functions.md "14.14 Locking Functions")).
For example, [`GET_LOCK()`](locking-functions.md#function_get-lock) does not
implement namespaces and provides only exclusive locks, not
distinct read and write locks.

##### 7.6.9.1.1 The Locking Service C Interface

This section describes how to use the locking service C
language interface. To use the function interface instead, see
[Section 7.6.9.1.2, “The Locking Service Function Interface”](locking-service.md#locking-service-interface "7.6.9.1.2 The Locking Service Function Interface") For general
characteristics of the locking service interface, see
[Section 7.6.9.1, “The Locking Service”](locking-service.md "7.6.9.1 The Locking Service"). For general information
about plugin services, see [Section 7.6.9, “MySQL Plugin Services”](plugin-services.md "7.6.9 MySQL Plugin Services").

Source files that use the locking service should include this
header file:

```c
#include <mysql/service_locking.h>
```

To acquire one or more locks, call this function:

```c
int mysql_acquire_locking_service_locks(MYSQL_THD opaque_thd,
                                        const char* lock_namespace,
                                        const char**lock_names,
                                        size_t lock_num,
                                        enum enum_locking_service_lock_type lock_type,
                                        unsigned long lock_timeout);
```

The arguments have these meanings:

- `opaque_thd`: A thread handle. If
  specified as `NULL`, the handle for the
  current thread is used.
- `lock_namespace`: A null-terminated
  string that indicates the lock namespace.
- `lock_names`: An array of null-terminated
  strings that provides the names of the locks to acquire.
- `lock_num`: The number of names in the
  `lock_names` array.
- `lock_type`: The lock mode, either
  `LOCKING_SERVICE_READ` or
  `LOCKING_SERVICE_WRITE` to acquire read
  locks or write locks, respectively.
- `lock_timeout`: An integer number of
  seconds to wait to acquire the locks before giving up.

To release locks acquired for a given namespace, call this
function:

```c
int mysql_release_locking_service_locks(MYSQL_THD opaque_thd,
                                        const char* lock_namespace);
```

The arguments have these meanings:

- `opaque_thd`: A thread handle. If
  specified as `NULL`, the handle for the
  current thread is used.
- `lock_namespace`: A null-terminated
  string that indicates the lock namespace.

Locks acquired or waited for by the locking service can be
monitored at the SQL level using the Performance Schema. For
details, see [Locking Service Monitoring](locking-service.md#locking-service-monitoring "Locking Service Monitoring").

##### 7.6.9.1.2 The Locking Service Function Interface

This section describes how to use the locking service
interface provided by its loadable functions. To use the C
language interface instead, see
[Section 7.6.9.1.1, “The Locking Service C Interface”](locking-service.md#locking-service-c-interface "7.6.9.1.1 The Locking Service C Interface") For general
characteristics of the locking service interface, see
[Section 7.6.9.1, “The Locking Service”](locking-service.md "7.6.9.1 The Locking Service"). For general information
about loadable functions, see

###### Installing or Uninstalling the Locking Service Function Interface

The locking service routines described in
[Section 7.6.9.1.1, “The Locking Service C Interface”](locking-service.md#locking-service-c-interface "7.6.9.1.1 The Locking Service C Interface") need not be
installed because they are built into the server. The same
is not true of the loadable functions that map onto calls to
the service routines: The functions must be installed before
use. This section describes how to do that. For general
information about loadable function installation, see
[Section 7.7.1, “Installing and Uninstalling Loadable Functions”](function-loading.md "7.7.1 Installing and Uninstalling Loadable Functions").

The locking service functions are implemented in a plugin
library file located in the directory named by the
[`plugin_dir`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_plugin_dir) system variable.
The file base name is `locking_service`.
The file name suffix differs per platform (for example,
`.so` for Unix and Unix-like systems,
`.dll` for Windows).

To install the locking service functions, use the
[`CREATE FUNCTION`](create-function.md "15.1.14 CREATE FUNCTION Statement") statement,
adjusting the `.so` suffix for your
platform as necessary:

```sql
CREATE FUNCTION service_get_read_locks RETURNS INT
  SONAME 'locking_service.so';
CREATE FUNCTION service_get_write_locks RETURNS INT
  SONAME 'locking_service.so';
CREATE FUNCTION service_release_locks RETURNS INT
  SONAME 'locking_service.so';
```

If the functions are used on a replication source server,
install them on all replica servers as well to avoid
replication problems.

Once installed, the functions remain installed until
uninstalled. To remove them, use the
[`DROP FUNCTION`](drop-function.md "15.1.26 DROP FUNCTION Statement") statement:

```sql
DROP FUNCTION service_get_read_locks;
DROP FUNCTION service_get_write_locks;
DROP FUNCTION service_release_locks;
```

###### Using the Locking Service Function Interface

Before using the locking service functions, install them
according to the instructions provided at
[Installing or Uninstalling the Locking Service Function Interface](locking-service.md#locking-service-function-installation "Installing or Uninstalling the Locking Service Function Interface").

To acquire one or more read locks, call this function:

```sql
mysql> SELECT service_get_read_locks('mynamespace', 'rlock1', 'rlock2', 10);
+---------------------------------------------------------------+
| service_get_read_locks('mynamespace', 'rlock1', 'rlock2', 10) |
+---------------------------------------------------------------+
|                                                             1 |
+---------------------------------------------------------------+
```

The first argument is the lock namespace. The final argument
is an integer timeout indicating how many seconds to wait to
acquire the locks before giving up. The arguments in between
are the lock names.

For the example just shown, the function acquires locks with
lock identifiers `(mynamespace, rlock1)`
and `(mynamespace, rlock2)`.

To acquire write locks rather than read locks, call this
function:

```sql
mysql> SELECT service_get_write_locks('mynamespace', 'wlock1', 'wlock2', 10);
+----------------------------------------------------------------+
| service_get_write_locks('mynamespace', 'wlock1', 'wlock2', 10) |
+----------------------------------------------------------------+
|                                                              1 |
+----------------------------------------------------------------+
```

In this case, the lock identifiers are
`(mynamespace, wlock1)` and
`(mynamespace, wlock2)`.

To release all locks for a namespace, use this function:

```sql
mysql> SELECT service_release_locks('mynamespace');
+--------------------------------------+
| service_release_locks('mynamespace') |
+--------------------------------------+
|                                    1 |
+--------------------------------------+
```

Each locking function returns nonzero for success. If the
function fails, an error occurs. For example, the following
error occurs because lock names cannot be empty:

```sql
mysql> SELECT service_get_read_locks('mynamespace', '', 10);
ERROR 3131 (42000): Incorrect locking service lock name ''.
```

A session can acquire multiple locks for the same lock
identifier. As long as a different session does not have a
write lock for an identifier, the session can acquire any
number of read or write locks. Each lock request for the
identifier acquires a new lock. The following statements
acquire three write locks with the same identifier, then
three read locks for the same identifier:

```sql
SELECT service_get_write_locks('ns', 'lock1', 'lock1', 'lock1', 0);
SELECT service_get_read_locks('ns', 'lock1', 'lock1', 'lock1', 0);
```

If you examine the Performance Schema
`metadata_locks` table at this point, you
should find that the session holds six distinct locks with
the same `(ns, lock1)` identifier. (For
details, see [Locking Service Monitoring](locking-service.md#locking-service-monitoring "Locking Service Monitoring").)

Because the session holds at least one write lock on
`(ns, lock1)`, no other session can acquire
a lock for it, either read or write. If the session held
only read locks for the identifier, other sessions could
acquire read locks for it, but not write locks.

Locks for a single lock-acquisition call are acquired
atomically, but atomicity does not hold across calls. Thus,
for a statement such as the following, where
[`service_get_write_locks()`](locking-service.md#function_service-get-write-locks) is
called once per row of the result set, atomicity holds for
each individual call, but not for the statement as a whole:

```sql
SELECT service_get_write_locks('ns', 'lock1', 'lock2', 0) FROM t1 WHERE ... ;
```

Caution

Because the locking service returns a separate lock for
each successful request for a given lock identifier, it is
possible for a single statement to acquire a large number
of locks. For example:

```sql
INSERT INTO ... SELECT service_get_write_locks('ns', t1.col_name, 0) FROM t1;
```

These types of statements may have certain adverse
effects. For example, if the statement fails part way
through and rolls back, locks acquired up to the point of
failure still exist. If the intent is for there to be a
correspondence between rows inserted and locks acquired,
that intent is not satisfied. Also, if it is important
that locks are granted in a certain order, be aware that
result set order may differ depending on which execution
plan the optimizer chooses. For these reasons, it may be
best to limit applications to a single lock-acquisition
call per statement.

###### Locking Service Monitoring

The locking service is implemented using the MySQL Server
metadata locks framework, so you monitor locking service
locks acquired or waited for by examining the Performance
Schema `metadata_locks` table.

First, enable the metadata lock instrument:

```sql
mysql> UPDATE performance_schema.setup_instruments SET ENABLED = 'YES'
    -> WHERE NAME = 'wait/lock/metadata/sql/mdl';
```

Then acquire some locks and check the contents of the
`metadata_locks` table:

```sql
mysql> SELECT service_get_write_locks('mynamespace', 'lock1', 0);
+----------------------------------------------------+
| service_get_write_locks('mynamespace', 'lock1', 0) |
+----------------------------------------------------+
|                                                  1 |
+----------------------------------------------------+
mysql> SELECT service_get_read_locks('mynamespace', 'lock2', 0);
+---------------------------------------------------+
| service_get_read_locks('mynamespace', 'lock2', 0) |
+---------------------------------------------------+
|                                                 1 |
+---------------------------------------------------+
mysql> SELECT OBJECT_TYPE, OBJECT_SCHEMA, OBJECT_NAME, LOCK_TYPE, LOCK_STATUS
    -> FROM performance_schema.metadata_locks
    -> WHERE OBJECT_TYPE = 'LOCKING SERVICE'\G
*************************** 1. row ***************************
  OBJECT_TYPE: LOCKING SERVICE
OBJECT_SCHEMA: mynamespace
  OBJECT_NAME: lock1
    LOCK_TYPE: EXCLUSIVE
  LOCK_STATUS: GRANTED
*************************** 2. row ***************************
  OBJECT_TYPE: LOCKING SERVICE
OBJECT_SCHEMA: mynamespace
  OBJECT_NAME: lock2
    LOCK_TYPE: SHARED
  LOCK_STATUS: GRANTED
```

Locking service locks have an `OBJECT_TYPE`
value of `LOCKING SERVICE`. This is
distinct from, for example, locks acquired with the
[`GET_LOCK()`](locking-functions.md#function_get-lock) function, which
have an `OBJECT_TYPE` of `USER
LEVEL LOCK`.

The lock namespace, name, and mode appear in the
`OBJECT_SCHEMA`,
`OBJECT_NAME`, and
`LOCK_TYPE` columns. Read and write locks
have `LOCK_TYPE` values of
`SHARED` and `EXCLUSIVE`,
respectively.

The `LOCK_STATUS` value is
`GRANTED` for an acquired lock,
`PENDING` for a lock that is being waited
for. You can expect to see `PENDING` if one
session holds a write lock and another session is attempting
to acquire a lock having the same identifier.

###### Locking Service Interface Function Reference

The SQL interface to the locking service implements the
loadable functions described in this section. For usage
examples, see
[Using the Locking Service Function Interface](locking-service.md#locking-service-function-usage "Using the Locking Service Function Interface").

The functions share these characteristics:

- The return value is nonzero for success. Otherwise, an
  error occurs.
- Namespace and lock names must be
  non-`NULL`, nonempty, and have a
  maximum length of 64 characters.
- Timeout values must be integers indicating how many
  seconds to wait to acquire locks before giving up with
  an error. If the timeout is 0, there is no waiting and
  the function produces an error if locks cannot be
  acquired immediately.

These locking service functions are available:

- [`service_get_read_locks(namespace,
  lock_name[,
  lock_name] ...,
  timeout)`](locking-service.md#function_service-get-read-locks)

  Acquires one or more read (shared) locks in the given
  namespace using the given lock names, timing out with an
  error if the locks are not acquired within the given
  timeout value.
- [`service_get_write_locks(namespace,
  lock_name[,
  lock_name] ...,
  timeout)`](locking-service.md#function_service-get-write-locks)

  Acquires one or more write (exclusive) locks in the
  given namespace using the given lock names, timing out
  with an error if the locks are not acquired within the
  given timeout value.
- [`service_release_locks(namespace)`](locking-service.md#function_service-release-locks)

  For the given namespace, releases all locks that were
  acquired within the current session using
  [`service_get_read_locks()`](locking-service.md#function_service-get-read-locks)
  and
  [`service_get_write_locks()`](locking-service.md#function_service-get-write-locks).

  It is not an error for there to be no locks in the
  namespace.
