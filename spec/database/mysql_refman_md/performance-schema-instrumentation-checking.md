### 29.4.10 Determining What Is Instrumented

It is always possible to determine what instruments the
Performance Schema includes by checking the
[`setup_instruments`](performance-schema-setup-instruments-table.md "29.12.2.3 The setup_instruments Table") table. For
example, to see what file-related events are instrumented for
the `InnoDB` storage engine, use this query:

```sql
mysql> SELECT NAME, ENABLED, TIMED
       FROM performance_schema.setup_instruments
       WHERE NAME LIKE 'wait/io/file/innodb/%';
+-------------------------------------------------+---------+-------+
| NAME                                            | ENABLED | TIMED |
+-------------------------------------------------+---------+-------+
| wait/io/file/innodb/innodb_tablespace_open_file | YES     | YES   |
| wait/io/file/innodb/innodb_data_file            | YES     | YES   |
| wait/io/file/innodb/innodb_log_file             | YES     | YES   |
| wait/io/file/innodb/innodb_temp_file            | YES     | YES   |
| wait/io/file/innodb/innodb_arch_file            | YES     | YES   |
| wait/io/file/innodb/innodb_clone_file           | YES     | YES   |
+-------------------------------------------------+---------+-------+
```

An exhaustive description of precisely what is instrumented is
not given in this documentation, for several reasons:

- What is instrumented is the server code. Changes to this
  code occur often, which also affects the set of instruments.
- It is not practical to list all the instruments because
  there are hundreds of them.
- As described earlier, it is possible to find out by querying
  the [`setup_instruments`](performance-schema-setup-instruments-table.md "29.12.2.3 The setup_instruments Table") table.
  This information is always up to date for your version of
  MySQL, also includes instrumentation for instrumented
  plugins you might have installed that are not part of the
  core server, and can be used by automated tools.
