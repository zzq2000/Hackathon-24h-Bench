### 19.4.11 Delayed Replication

MySQL supports delayed replication such that a replica server
deliberately executes transactions later than the source by at
least a specified amount of time. This section describes how to
configure a replication delay on a replica, and how to monitor
replication delay.

In MySQL 8.0, the method of delaying replication
depends on two timestamps,
`immediate_commit_timestamp` and
`original_commit_timestamp` (see
[Replication Delay Timestamps](replication-delayed.md#replication-delayed-timestamps "Replication Delay Timestamps")). If all servers
in the replication topology are running MySQL 8.0 or above,
delayed replication is measured using these timestamps. If either
the immediate source or replica is not using these timestamps, the
implementation of delayed replication from MySQL 5.7 is used (see
[Delayed Replication](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/replication-delayed.html)). This section
describes delayed replication between servers which are all using
these timestamps.

The default replication delay is 0 seconds. Use a
[`CHANGE
REPLICATION SOURCE TO
SOURCE_DELAY=N`](change-replication-source-to.md "15.4.2.3 CHANGE REPLICATION SOURCE TO Statement") statement
(from MySQL 8.0.23) or a `CHANGE MASTER TO
MASTER_DELAY=N` statement
(before MySQL 8.0.23) to set the delay to
*`N`* seconds. A transaction received from
the source is not executed until at least
*`N`* seconds later than its commit on the
immediate source. The delay happens per transaction (not event as
in previous MySQL versions) and the actual delay is imposed only
on `gtid_log_event` or
`anonymous_gtid_log_event`. The other events in
the transaction always follow these events without any waiting
time imposed on them.

Note

[`START REPLICA`](start-replica.md "15.4.2.6 START REPLICA Statement") and
[`STOP REPLICA`](stop-replica.md "15.4.2.8 STOP REPLICA Statement") take effect
immediately and ignore any delay. [`RESET
REPLICA`](reset-replica.md "15.4.2.4 RESET REPLICA Statement") resets the delay to 0.

The [`replication_applier_configuration`](performance-schema-replication-applier-configuration-table.md "29.12.11.2 The replication_applier_configuration Table")
Performance Schema table contains the
`DESIRED_DELAY` column which shows the delay
configured using the `SOURCE_DELAY` |
`MASTER_DELAY` option. The
[`replication_applier_status`](performance-schema-replication-applier-status-table.md "29.12.11.3 The replication_applier_status Table")
Performance Schema table contains the
`REMAINING_DELAY` column which shows the number
of delay seconds remaining.

Delayed replication can be used for several purposes:

- To protect against user mistakes on the source. With a delay
  you can roll back a delayed replica to the time just before
  the mistake.
- To test how the system behaves when there is a lag. For
  example, in an application, a lag might be caused by a heavy
  load on the replica. However, it can be difficult to generate
  this load level. Delayed replication can simulate the lag
  without having to simulate the load. It can also be used to
  debug conditions related to a lagging replica.
- To inspect what the database looked like in the past, without
  having to reload a backup. For example, by configuring a
  replica with a delay of one week, if you then need to see what
  the database looked like before the last few days' worth of
  development, the delayed replica can be inspected.

#### Replication Delay Timestamps

MySQL 8.0 provides a new method for measuring delay
(also referred to as replication lag) in replication topologies
that depends on the following timestamps associated with the
GTID of each transaction (instead of each event) written to the
binary log.

- `original_commit_timestamp`: the number of
  microseconds since epoch when the transaction was written
  (committed) to the binary log of the original source.
- `immediate_commit_timestamp`: the number of
  microseconds since epoch when the transaction was written
  (committed) to the binary log of the immediate source.

The output of [**mysqlbinlog**](mysqlbinlog.md "6.6.9 mysqlbinlog — Utility for Processing Binary Log Files") displays these
timestamps in two formats, microseconds from epoch and also
`TIMESTAMP` format, which is based on the user
defined time zone for better readability. For example:

```none
#170404 10:48:05 server id 1  end_log_pos 233 CRC32 0x016ce647     GTID    last_committed=0
\ sequence_number=1    original_committed_timestamp=1491299285661130    immediate_commit_timestamp=1491299285843771
# original_commit_timestamp=1491299285661130 (2017-04-04 10:48:05.661130 WEST)
# immediate_commit_timestamp=1491299285843771 (2017-04-04 10:48:05.843771 WEST)
 /*!80001 SET @@SESSION.original_commit_timestamp=1491299285661130*//*!*/;
   SET @@SESSION.GTID_NEXT= 'aaaaaaaa-aaaa-aaaa-aaaa-aaaaaaaaaaaa:1'/*!*/;
# at 233
```

As a rule, the `original_commit_timestamp` is
always the same on all replicas where the transaction is
applied. In source-replica replication, the
`original_commit_timestamp` of a transaction in
the (original) source’s binary log is always the same as its
`immediate_commit_timestamp`. In the
replica’s relay log, the
`original_commit_timestamp` and
`immediate_commit_timestamp` of the transaction
are the same as in the source’s binary log; whereas in its own
binary log, the transaction’s
`immediate_commit_timestamp` corresponds to
when the replica committed the transaction.

In a Group Replication setup, when the original source is a
member of a group, the
`original_commit_timestamp` is generated when
the transaction is ready to be committed. In other words, when
it finished executing on the original source and its write set
is ready to be sent to all members of the group for
certification. When the original source is a server outside the
group, the `original_commit_timestamp` is
preserved. The same `original_commit_timestamp`
for a particular transaction is replicated to all servers in the
group, and to any replica outside the group that is replicating
from a member. Beginning with MySQL 8.0.26, each recipient of
the transaction also stores the local commit time in its binary
log using `immediate_commit_timestamp`.

View change events, which are exclusive to Group Replication,
are a special case. Transactions containing these events are
generated by each group member but share the same GTID (so, they
are not first executed in a source and then replicated to the
group, but all members of the group execute and apply the same
transaction). Before MySQL 8.0.26, these transactions have their
`original_commit_timestamp` set to zero, and
they appear this way in viewable output. Beginning with MySQL
8.0.26, for improved observability, group members set local
timestamp values for transactions associated with view change
events.

#### Monitoring Replication Delay

One of the most common ways to monitor replication delay (lag)
in previous MySQL versions was by relying on the
`Seconds_Behind_Master` field in the output of
`SHOW REPLICA STATUS`. However, this metric is
not suitable when using replication topologies more complex than
the traditional source-replica setup, such as Group Replication.
The addition of `immediate_commit_timestamp`
and `original_commit_timestamp` to MySQL 8
provides a much finer degree of information about replication
delay. The recommended method to monitor replication delay in a
topology that supports these timestamps is using the following
Performance Schema tables.

- [`replication_connection_status`](performance-schema-replication-connection-status-table.md "29.12.11.11 The replication_connection_status Table"):
  current status of the connection to the source, provides
  information on the last and current transaction the
  connection thread queued into the relay log.
- [`replication_applier_status_by_coordinator`](performance-schema-replication-applier-status-by-coordinator-table.md "29.12.11.4 The replication_applier_status_by_coordinator Table"):
  current status of the coordinator thread that only displays
  information when using a multithreaded replica, provides
  information on the last transaction buffered by the
  coordinator thread to a worker’s queue, as well as the
  transaction it is currently buffering.
- [`replication_applier_status_by_worker`](performance-schema-replication-applier-status-by-worker-table.md "29.12.11.5 The replication_applier_status_by_worker Table"):
  current status of the thread(s) applying transactions
  received from the source, provides information about the
  transactions applied by the replication SQL thread, or by
  each worker thread when using a multithreaded replica.

Using these tables you can monitor information about the last
transaction the corresponding thread processed and the
transaction that thread is currently processing. This
information comprises:

- a transaction’s GTID
- a transaction's `original_commit_timestamp`
  and `immediate_commit_timestamp`, retrieved
  from the replica’s relay log
- the time a thread started processing a transaction
- for the last processed transaction, the time the thread
  finished processing it

In addition to the Performance Schema tables, the output of
[`SHOW REPLICA STATUS`](show-replica-status.md "15.7.7.35 SHOW REPLICA STATUS Statement") has three
fields that show:

- `SQL_Delay`: A nonnegative integer
  indicating the replication delay configured using
  [`CHANGE
  REPLICATION SOURCE TO
  SOURCE_DELAY=N`](change-replication-source-to.md "15.4.2.3 CHANGE REPLICATION SOURCE TO Statement") (from
  MySQL 8.0.23) or `CHANGE MASTER TO
  MASTER_DELAY=N` (before MySQL 8.0.23), measured in
  seconds.
- `SQL_Remaining_Delay`: When
  `Replica_SQL_Running_State` is
  `Waiting until MASTER_DELAY seconds after master
  executed event`, this field contains an integer
  indicating the number of seconds left of the delay. At other
  times, this field is `NULL`.
- `Replica_SQL_Running_State`: A string
  indicating the state of the SQL thread (analogous to
  `Replica_IO_State`). The value is identical
  to the `State` value of the SQL thread as
  displayed by [`SHOW
  PROCESSLIST`](show-processlist.md "15.7.7.29 SHOW PROCESSLIST Statement").

When the replication SQL thread is waiting for the delay to
elapse before executing an event, [`SHOW
PROCESSLIST`](show-processlist.md "15.7.7.29 SHOW PROCESSLIST Statement") displays its `State`
value as `Waiting until MASTER_DELAY seconds after
master executed event`.
