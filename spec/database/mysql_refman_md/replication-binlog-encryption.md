[19.3.2.3 Binary Log Master Key Rotation](replication-binlog-encryption-key-rotation.md)

From MySQL 8.0.14, binary log files and relay log files can be
encrypted, helping to protect these files and the potentially
sensitive data contained in them from being misused by outside
attackers, and also from unauthorized viewing by users of the
operating system where they are stored. The encryption algorithm
used for the files, the AES (Advanced Encryption Standard) cipher
algorithm, is built in to MySQL Server and cannot be configured.

You enable this encryption on a MySQL server by setting the
[`binlog_encryption`](replication-options-binary-log.md#sysvar_binlog_encryption) system variable
to `ON`. `OFF` is the default.
The system variable sets encryption on for binary log files and
relay log files. Binary logging does not need to be enabled on the
server to enable encryption, so you can encrypt the relay log
files on a replica that has no binary log. To use encryption, a
keyring component or plugin must be installed and configured to
supply MySQL Server's keyring service. For instructions to do
this, see [Section 8.4.4, “The MySQL Keyring”](keyring.md "8.4.4 The MySQL Keyring"). Any supported keyring
component or plugin can be used to store binary log encryption
keys.

When you first start the server with encryption enabled, a new
binary log encryption key is generated before the binary log and
relay logs are initialized. This key is used to encrypt a file
password for each binary log file (if the server has binary
logging enabled) and relay log file (if the server has replication
channels), and further keys generated from the file passwords are
used to encrypt the data in the files. The binary log encryption
key that is currently in use on the server is called the binary
log master key. The two tier encryption key architecture means
that the binary log master key can be rotated (replaced by a new
master key) as required, and only the file password for each file
needs to be re-encrypted with the new master key, not the whole
file. Relay log files are encrypted for all channels, including
new channels that are created after encryption is activated. The
binary log index file and relay log index file are never
encrypted.

If you activate encryption while the server is running, a new
binary log encryption key is generated at that time. The exception
is if encryption was active previously on the server and was then
disabled, in which case the binary log encryption key that was in
use before is used again. The binary log file and relay log files
are rotated immediately, and file passwords for the new files and
all subsequent binary log files and relay log files are encrypted
using this binary log encryption key. Existing binary log files
and relay log files still present on the server are not encrypted,
but you can purge them if they are no longer needed.

If you deactivate encryption by changing the
[`binlog_encryption`](replication-options-binary-log.md#sysvar_binlog_encryption) system variable
to `OFF`, the binary log file and relay log files
are rotated immediately and all subsequent logging is unencrypted.
Previously encrypted files are not automatically decrypted, but
the server is still able to read them. The
[`BINLOG_ENCRYPTION_ADMIN`](privileges-provided.md#priv_binlog-encryption-admin) privilege
is required to activate or deactivate encryption while the server
is running.

Encrypted and unencrypted binary log files can be distinguished
using the magic number at the start of the file header for
encrypted log files (`0xFD62696E`), which differs
from that used for unencrypted log files
(`0xFE62696E`). The [`SHOW
BINARY LOGS`](show-binary-logs.md "15.7.7.1 SHOW BINARY LOGS Statement") statement shows whether each binary log file
is encrypted or unencrypted.

When binary log files have been encrypted,
[**mysqlbinlog**](mysqlbinlog.md "6.6.9 mysqlbinlog — Utility for Processing Binary Log Files") cannot read them directly, but can
read them from the server using the
[`--read-from-remote-server`](mysqlbinlog.md#option_mysqlbinlog_read-from-remote-server)
option. From MySQL 8.0.14, [**mysqlbinlog**](mysqlbinlog.md "6.6.9 mysqlbinlog — Utility for Processing Binary Log Files") returns
a suitable error if you attempt to read an encrypted binary log
file directly, but older versions of
[**mysqlbinlog**](mysqlbinlog.md "6.6.9 mysqlbinlog — Utility for Processing Binary Log Files") do not recognize the file as a
binary log file at all. If you back up encrypted binary log files
using [**mysqlbinlog**](mysqlbinlog.md "6.6.9 mysqlbinlog — Utility for Processing Binary Log Files"), note that the copies of the
files that are generated using [**mysqlbinlog**](mysqlbinlog.md "6.6.9 mysqlbinlog — Utility for Processing Binary Log Files") are
stored in an unencrypted format.

Binary log encryption can be combined with binary log transaction
compression (available as of MySQL 8.0.20). For more information
on binary log transaction compression, see
[Section 7.4.4.5, “Binary Log Transaction Compression”](binary-log-transaction-compression.md "7.4.4.5 Binary Log Transaction Compression").
