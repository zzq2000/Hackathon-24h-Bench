### 29.12.19 Performance Schema Clone Tables

[29.12.19.1 The clone\_status Table](performance-schema-clone-status-table.md)

[29.12.19.2 The clone\_progress Table](performance-schema-clone-progress-table.md)

Note

The Performance Schema tables described here are available as
of MySQL 8.0.17.

The following sections describe the Performance Schema tables
associated with the clone plugin (see
[Section 7.6.7, “The Clone Plugin”](clone-plugin.md "7.6.7 The Clone Plugin")). The tables provide information
about cloning operations.

- `clone_status`: status information about
  the current or last executed cloning operation.
- `clone_progress`: progress information
  about the current or last executed cloning operation.

The Performance Schema clone tables are implemented by the clone
plugin and are loaded and unloaded when that plugin is loaded
and unloaded (see [Section 7.6.7.1, “Installing the Clone Plugin”](clone-plugin-installation.md "7.6.7.1 Installing the Clone Plugin")).
No special configuration step for the tables is needed. However,
the tables depend on the clone plugin being enabled. If the
clone plugin is loaded but disabled, the tables are not created.

The Performance Schema clone plugin tables are used only on the
recipient MySQL server instance. The data is persisted across
server shutdown and restart.
