### 14.9.2 Boolean Full-Text Searches

MySQL can perform boolean full-text searches using the
`IN BOOLEAN MODE` modifier. With this modifier,
certain characters have special meaning at the beginning or end
of words in the search string. In the following query, the
`+` and `-` operators indicate
that a word must be present or absent, respectively, for a match
to occur. Thus, the query retrieves all the rows that contain
the word “MySQL” but that do
*not* contain the word
“YourSQL”:

```sql
mysql> SELECT * FROM articles WHERE MATCH (title,body)
    -> AGAINST ('+MySQL -YourSQL' IN BOOLEAN MODE);
+----+-----------------------+-------------------------------------+
| id | title                 | body                                |

Note

In implementing this feature, MySQL uses what is sometimes
referred to as implied Boolean
logic, in which

- `+` stands for `AND`
- `-` stands for `NOT`
- [*no operator*] implies
  `OR`

Boolean full-text searches have these characteristics:

- They do not automatically sort rows in order of decreasing
  relevance.
- `InnoDB` tables require a
  `FULLTEXT` index on all columns of the
  [`MATCH()`](fulltext-search.md#function_match) expression to perform
  boolean queries. Boolean queries against a
  `MyISAM` search index can work even without
  a `FULLTEXT` index, although a search
  executed in this fashion would be quite slow.
- The minimum and maximum word length full-text parameters
  apply to `FULLTEXT` indexes created using
  the built-in `FULLTEXT` parser and MeCab
  parser plugin.
  [`innodb_ft_min_token_size`](innodb-parameters.md#sysvar_innodb_ft_min_token_size)
  and
  [`innodb_ft_max_token_size`](innodb-parameters.md#sysvar_innodb_ft_max_token_size)
  are used for `InnoDB` search indexes.
  [`ft_min_word_len`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_ft_min_word_len) and
  [`ft_max_word_len`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_ft_max_word_len) are used
  for `MyISAM` search indexes.

  Minimum and maximum word length full-text parameters do not
  apply to `FULLTEXT` indexes created using
  the ngram parser. ngram token size is defined by the
  [`ngram_token_size`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_ngram_token_size) option.
- The stopword list applies, controlled by
  [`innodb_ft_enable_stopword`](innodb-parameters.md#sysvar_innodb_ft_enable_stopword),
  [`innodb_ft_server_stopword_table`](innodb-parameters.md#sysvar_innodb_ft_server_stopword_table),
  and
  [`innodb_ft_user_stopword_table`](innodb-parameters.md#sysvar_innodb_ft_user_stopword_table)
  for `InnoDB` search indexes, and
  [`ft_stopword_file`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_ft_stopword_file) for
  `MyISAM` ones.
- `InnoDB` full-text search does not support
  the use of multiple operators on a single search word, as in
  this example: `'++apple'`. Use of multiple
  operators on a single search word returns a syntax error to
  standard out. MyISAM full-text search successfully processes
  the same search, ignoring all operators except for the
  operator immediately adjacent to the search word.
- `InnoDB` full-text search only supports
  leading plus or minus signs. For example,
  `InnoDB` supports
  `'+apple'` but does not support
  `'apple+'`. Specifying a trailing plus or
  minus sign causes `InnoDB` to report a
  syntax error.
- `InnoDB` full-text search does not support
  the use of a leading plus sign with wildcard
  (`'+*'`), a plus and minus sign combination
  (`'+-'`), or leading a plus and minus sign
  combination (`'+-apple'`). These invalid
  queries return a syntax error.
- `InnoDB` full-text search does not support
  the use of the `@` symbol in boolean
  full-text searches. The `@` symbol is
  reserved for use by the `@distance`
  proximity search operator.
- They do not use the 50% threshold that applies to
  `MyISAM` search indexes.

The boolean full-text search capability supports the following
operators:

- `+`

  A leading or trailing plus sign indicates that this word
  *must* be present in each row that is
  returned. `InnoDB` only supports leading
  plus signs.
- `-`

  A leading or trailing minus sign indicates that this word
  must *not* be present in any of the rows
  that are returned. `InnoDB` only supports
  leading minus signs.

  Note: The `-` operator acts only to exclude
  rows that are otherwise matched by other search terms. Thus,
  a boolean-mode search that contains only terms preceded by
  `-` returns an empty result. It does not
  return “all rows except those containing any of the
  excluded terms.”
- (no operator)

  By default (when neither `+` nor
  `-` is specified), the word is optional,
  but the rows that contain it are rated higher. This mimics
  the behavior of [`MATCH()
  AGAINST()`](fulltext-search.md#function_match) without the `IN BOOLEAN
  MODE` modifier.
- `@distance`

  This operator works on `InnoDB` tables
  only. It tests whether two or more words all start within a
  specified distance from each other, measured in words.
  Specify the search words within a double-quoted string
  immediately before the
  `@distance`
  operator, for example, `MATCH(col1) AGAINST('"word1
  word2 word3" @8' IN BOOLEAN MODE)`
- `> <`

  These two operators are used to change a word's contribution
  to the relevance value that is assigned to a row. The
  `>` operator increases the contribution
  and the `<` operator decreases it. See
  the example following this list.
- `( )`

  Parentheses group words into subexpressions. Parenthesized
  groups can be nested.
- `~`

  A leading tilde acts as a negation operator, causing the
  word's contribution to the row's relevance to be negative.
  This is useful for marking “noise” words. A row
  containing such a word is rated lower than others, but is
  not excluded altogether, as it would be with the
  `-` operator.
- `*`

  The asterisk serves as the truncation (or wildcard)
  operator. Unlike the other operators, it is
  *appended* to the word to be affected.
  Words match if they begin with the word preceding the
  `*` operator.

  If a word is specified with the truncation operator, it is
  not stripped from a boolean query, even if it is too short
  or a stopword. Whether a word is too short is determined
  from the
  [`innodb_ft_min_token_size`](innodb-parameters.md#sysvar_innodb_ft_min_token_size)
  setting for `InnoDB` tables, or
  [`ft_min_word_len`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_ft_min_word_len) for
  `MyISAM` tables. These options are not
  applicable to `FULLTEXT` indexes that use
  the ngram parser.

  The wildcarded word is considered as a prefix that must be
  present at the start of one or more words. If the minimum
  word length is 4, a search for
  `'+word +the*'`
  could return fewer rows than a search for
  `'+word +the'`,
  because the second query ignores the too-short search term
  `the`.
- `"`

  A phrase that is enclosed within double quote
  (`"`) characters matches only rows that
  contain the phrase *literally, as it was
  typed*. The full-text engine splits the phrase
  into words and performs a search in the
  `FULLTEXT` index for the words. Nonword
  characters need not be matched exactly: Phrase searching
  requires only that matches contain exactly the same words as
  the phrase and in the same order. For example,
  `"test phrase"` matches `"test,
  phrase"`.

  If the phrase contains no words that are in the index, the
  result is empty. The words might not be in the index because
  of a combination of factors: if they do not exist in the
  text, are stopwords, or are shorter than the minimum length
  of indexed words.

The following examples demonstrate some search strings that use
boolean full-text operators:

- `'apple banana'`

  Find rows that contain at least one of the two words.
- `'+apple +juice'`

  Find rows that contain both words.
- `'+apple macintosh'`

  Find rows that contain the word “apple”, but
  rank rows higher if they also contain
  “macintosh”.
- `'+apple -macintosh'`

  Find rows that contain the word “apple” but not
  “macintosh”.
- `'+apple ~macintosh'`

  Find rows that contain the word “apple”, but if
  the row also contains the word “macintosh”,
  rate it lower than if row does not. This is
  “softer” than a search for `'+apple
  -macintosh'`, for which the presence of
  “macintosh” causes the row not to be returned
  at all.
- `'+apple +(>turnover <strudel)'`

  Find rows that contain the words “apple” and
  “turnover”, or “apple” and
  “strudel” (in any order), but rank “apple
  turnover” higher than “apple strudel”.
- `'apple*'`

  Find rows that contain words such as “apple”,
  “apples”, “applesauce”, or
  “applet”.
- `'"some words"'`

  Find rows that contain the exact phrase “some
  words” (for example, rows that contain “some
  words of wisdom” but not “some noise
  words”). Note that the `"`
  characters that enclose the phrase are operator characters
  that delimit the phrase. They are not the quotation marks
  that enclose the search string itself.

#### Relevancy Rankings for InnoDB Boolean Mode Search

[`InnoDB`](innodb-storage-engine.md "Chapter 17 The InnoDB Storage Engine") full-text search is
modeled on the
[Sphinx](http://sphinxsearch.com/) full-text
search engine, and the algorithms used are based on
[BM25](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Okapi_BM25)
and
[TF-IDF](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TF-IDF)
ranking algorithms. For these reasons, relevancy rankings for
`InnoDB` boolean full-text search may differ
from [`MyISAM`](myisam-storage-engine.md "18.2 The MyISAM Storage Engine") relevancy rankings.

`InnoDB` uses a variation of the “term
frequency-inverse document frequency”
(`TF-IDF`) weighting system to rank a
document's relevance for a given full-text search query. The
`TF-IDF` weighting is based on how frequently
a word appears in a document, offset by how frequently the
word appears in all documents in the collection. In other
words, the more frequently a word appears in a document, and
the less frequently the word appears in the document
collection, the higher the document is ranked.

##### How Relevancy Ranking is Calculated

The term frequency (`TF`) value is the number
of times that a word appears in a document. The inverse
document frequency (`IDF`) value of a word is
calculated using the following formula, where
`total_records` is the number of records in
the collection, and `matching_records` is the
number of records that the search term appears in.

```simple
${IDF} = log10( ${total_records} / ${matching_records} )
```

When a document contains a word multiple times, the IDF value
is multiplied by the TF value:

```simple
${TF} * ${IDF}
```

Using the `TF` and `IDF`
values, the relevancy ranking for a document is calculated
using this formula:

```simple
${rank} = ${TF} * ${IDF} * ${IDF}
```

The formula is demonstrated in the following examples.

##### Relevancy Ranking for a Single Word Search

This example demonstrates the relevancy ranking calculation
for a single-word search.

```sql
mysql> CREATE TABLE articles (
    ->   id INT UNSIGNED AUTO_INCREMENT NOT NULL PRIMARY KEY,
    ->   title VARCHAR(200),
    ->   body TEXT,
    ->   FULLTEXT (title,body)
    ->)  ENGINE=InnoDB;
Query OK, 0 rows affected (1.04 sec)

mysql> INSERT INTO articles (title,body) VALUES
    ->   ('MySQL Tutorial','This database tutorial ...'),
    ->   ("How To Use MySQL",'After you went through a ...'),
    ->   ('Optimizing Your Database','In this database tutorial ...'),
    ->   ('MySQL vs. YourSQL','When comparing databases ...'),
    ->   ('MySQL Security','When configured properly, MySQL ...'),
    ->   ('Database, Database, Database','database database database'),
    ->   ('1001 MySQL Tricks','1. Never run mysqld as root. 2. ...'),
    ->   ('MySQL Full-Text Indexes', 'MySQL fulltext indexes use a ..');
Query OK, 8 rows affected (0.06 sec)
Records: 8  Duplicates: 0  Warnings: 0

mysql> SELECT id, title, body,
    ->   MATCH (title,body) AGAINST ('database' IN BOOLEAN MODE) AS score
    ->   FROM articles ORDER BY score DESC;
+----+------------------------------+-------------------------------------+---------------------+
| id | title                        | body                                | score               |

+----+------------------------------+-------------------------------------+---------------------+
8 rows in set (0.00 sec)
```

There are 8 records in total, with 3 that match the
“database” search term. The first record
(`id 6`) contains the search term 6 times and
has a relevancy ranking of
`1.0886961221694946`. This ranking value is
calculated using a `TF` value of 6 (the
“database” search term appears 6 times in record
`id 6`) and an `IDF` value
of 0.42596873216370745, which is calculated as follows (where
8 is the total number of records and 3 is the number of
records that the search term appears in):

```simple
${IDF} = LOG10( 8 / 3 ) = 0.42596873216370745
```

The `TF` and `IDF` values
are then entered into the ranking formula:

```simple
${rank} = ${TF} * ${IDF} * ${IDF}
```

Performing the calculation in the MySQL command-line client
returns a ranking value of 1.088696164686938.

```sql
mysql> SELECT 6*LOG10(8/3)*LOG10(8/3);
+-------------------------+
| 6*LOG10(8/3)*LOG10(8/3) |
+-------------------------+
|       1.088696164686938 |
+-------------------------+
1 row in set (0.00 sec)
```

Note

You may notice a slight difference in the ranking values
returned by the `SELECT ... MATCH ...
AGAINST` statement and the MySQL command-line
client (`1.0886961221694946` versus
`1.088696164686938`). The difference is due
to how the casts between integers and floats/doubles are
performed internally by `InnoDB` (along
with related precision and rounding decisions), and how they
are performed elsewhere, such as in the MySQL command-line
client or other types of calculators.

##### Relevancy Ranking for a Multiple Word Search

This example demonstrates the relevancy ranking calculation
for a multiple-word full-text search based on the
`articles` table and data used in the
previous example.

If you search on more than one word, the relevancy ranking
value is a sum of the relevancy ranking value for each word,
as shown in this formula:

```simple
${rank} = ${TF} * ${IDF} * ${IDF} + ${TF} * ${IDF} * ${IDF}
```

Performing a search on two terms ('mysql tutorial') returns
the following results:

```sql
mysql> SELECT id, title, body, MATCH (title,body)
    ->   AGAINST ('mysql tutorial' IN BOOLEAN MODE) AS score
    ->   FROM articles ORDER BY score DESC;
+----+------------------------------+-------------------------------------+----------------------+
| id | title                        | body                                | score                |
+----+------------------------------+-------------------------------------+----------------------+
|  1 | MySQL Tutorial               | This database tutorial ...          |   0.7405621409416199 |
|  3 | Optimizing Your Database     | In this database tutorial ...       |   0.3624762296676636 |

+----+------------------------------+-------------------------------------+----------------------+
8 rows in set (0.00 sec)
```

In the first record (`id 8`), 'mysql' appears
once and 'tutorial' appears twice. There are six matching
records for 'mysql' and two matching records for 'tutorial'.
The MySQL command-line client returns the expected ranking
value when inserting these values into the ranking formula for
a multiple word search:

```sql
mysql> SELECT (1*log10(8/6)*log10(8/6)) + (2*log10(8/2)*log10(8/2));
+-------------------------------------------------------+
| (1*log10(8/6)*log10(8/6)) + (2*log10(8/2)*log10(8/2)) |
+-------------------------------------------------------+
|                                    0.7405621541938003 |
+-------------------------------------------------------+
1 row in set (0.00 sec)
```

Note

The slight difference in the ranking values returned by the
`SELECT ... MATCH ... AGAINST` statement
and the MySQL command-line client is explained in the
preceding example.
