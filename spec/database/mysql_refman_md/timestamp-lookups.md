### 10.3.14 Indexed Lookups from TIMESTAMP Columns

Temporal values are stored in
[`TIMESTAMP`](datetime.md "13.2.2 The DATE, DATETIME, and TIMESTAMP Types") columns as UTC values,
and values inserted into and retrieved from
[`TIMESTAMP`](datetime.md "13.2.2 The DATE, DATETIME, and TIMESTAMP Types") columns are converted
between the session time zone and UTC. (This is the same type of
conversion performed by the
[`CONVERT_TZ()`](date-and-time-functions.md#function_convert-tz) function. If the
session time zone is UTC, there is effectively no time zone
conversion.)

Due to conventions for local time zone changes such as Daylight
Saving Time (DST), conversions between UTC and non-UTC time
zones are not one-to-one in both directions. UTC values that are
distinct may not be distinct in another time zone. The following
example shows distinct UTC values that become identical in a
non-UTC time zone:

```sql
mysql> CREATE TABLE tstable (ts TIMESTAMP);
mysql> SET time_zone = 'UTC'; -- insert UTC values
mysql> INSERT INTO tstable VALUES
       ('2018-10-28 00:30:00'),
       ('2018-10-28 01:30:00');
mysql> SELECT ts FROM tstable;
+---------------------+
| ts                  |
+---------------------+
| 2018-10-28 00:30:00 |
| 2018-10-28 01:30:00 |
+---------------------+
mysql> SET time_zone = 'MET'; -- retrieve non-UTC values
mysql> SELECT ts FROM tstable;
+---------------------+
| ts                  |
+---------------------+
| 2018-10-28 02:30:00 |
| 2018-10-28 02:30:00 |
+---------------------+
```

Note

To use named time zones such as `'MET'` or
`'Europe/Amsterdam'`, the time zone tables
must be properly set up. For instructions, see
[Section 7.1.15, “MySQL Server Time Zone Support”](time-zone-support.md "7.1.15 MySQL Server Time Zone Support").

You can see that the two distinct UTC values are the same when
converted to the `'MET'` time zone. This
phenomenon can lead to different results for a given
[`TIMESTAMP`](datetime.md "13.2.2 The DATE, DATETIME, and TIMESTAMP Types") column query, depending
on whether the optimizer uses an index to execute the query.

Suppose that a query selects values from the table shown earlier
using a `WHERE` clause to search the
`ts` column for a single specific value such as
a user-provided timestamp literal:

```sql
SELECT ts FROM tstable
WHERE ts = 'literal';
```

Suppose further that the query executes under these conditions:

- The session time zone is not UTC and has a DST shift. For
  example:

  ```sql
  SET time_zone = 'MET';
  ```
- Unique UTC values stored in the
  [`TIMESTAMP`](datetime.md "13.2.2 The DATE, DATETIME, and TIMESTAMP Types") column are not
  unique in the session time zone due to DST shifts. (The
  example shown earlier illustrates how this can occur.)
- The query specifies a search value that is within the hour
  of entry into DST in the session time zone.

Under those conditions, the comparison in the
`WHERE` clause occurs in different ways for
nonindexed and indexed lookups and leads to different results:

- If there is no index or the optimizer cannot use it,
  comparisons occur in the session time zone. The optimizer
  performs a table scan in which it retrieves each
  `ts` column value, converts it from UTC to
  the session time zone, and compares it to the search value
  (also interpreted in the session time zone):

  ```sql
  mysql> SELECT ts FROM tstable
         WHERE ts = '2018-10-28 02:30:00';
  +---------------------+
  | ts                  |
  +---------------------+
  | 2018-10-28 02:30:00 |
  | 2018-10-28 02:30:00 |
  +---------------------+
  ```

  Because the stored `ts` values are
  converted to the session time zone, it is possible for the
  query to return two timestamp values that are distinct as
  UTC values but equal in the session time zone: One value
  that occurs before the DST shift when clocks are changed,
  and one value that was occurs after the DST shift.
- If there is a usable index, comparisons occur in UTC. The
  optimizer performs an index scan, first converting the
  search value from the session time zone to UTC, then
  comparing the result to the UTC index entries:

  ```sql
  mysql> ALTER TABLE tstable ADD INDEX (ts);
  mysql> SELECT ts FROM tstable
         WHERE ts = '2018-10-28 02:30:00';
  +---------------------+
  | ts                  |
  +---------------------+
  | 2018-10-28 02:30:00 |
  +---------------------+
  ```

  In this case, the (converted) search value is matched only
  to index entries, and because the index entries for the
  distinct stored UTC values are also distinct, the search
  value can match only one of them.

Due to different optimizer operation for nonindexed and indexed
lookups, the query produces different results in each case. The
result from the nonindexed lookup returns all values that match
in the session time zone. The indexed lookup cannot do so:

- It is performed within the storage engine, which knows only
  about UTC values.
- For the two distinct session time zone values that map to
  the same UTC value, the indexed lookup matches only the
  corresponding UTC index entry and returns only a single row.

In the preceding discussion, the data set stored in
`tstable` happens to consist of distinct UTC
values. In such cases, all index-using queries of the form shown
match at most one index entry.

If the index is not `UNIQUE`, it is possible
for the table (and the index) to store multiple instances of a
given UTC value. For example, the `ts` column
might contain multiple instances of the UTC value
`'2018-10-28 00:30:00'`. In this case, the
index-using query would return each of them (converted to the
MET value `'2018-10-28 02:30:00'` in the result
set). It remains true that index-using queries match the
converted search value to a single value in the UTC index
entries, rather than matching multiple UTC values that convert
to the search value in the session time zone.

If it is important to return all `ts` values
that match in the session time zone, the workaround is to
suppress use of the index with an `IGNORE
INDEX` hint:

```sql
mysql> SELECT ts FROM tstable
       IGNORE INDEX (ts)
       WHERE ts = '2018-10-28 02:30:00';
+---------------------+
| ts                  |
+---------------------+
| 2018-10-28 02:30:00 |
| 2018-10-28 02:30:00 |
+---------------------+
```

The same lack of one-to-one mapping for time zone conversions in
both directions occurs in other contexts as well, such as
conversions performed with the
[`FROM_UNIXTIME()`](date-and-time-functions.md#function_from-unixtime) and
[`UNIX_TIMESTAMP()`](date-and-time-functions.md#function_unix-timestamp) functions. See
[Section 14.7, “Date and Time Functions”](date-and-time-functions.md "14.7 Date and Time Functions").
