### 15.3.6 LOCK TABLES and UNLOCK TABLES Statements

```sql
LOCK {TABLE | TABLES}
    tbl_name [[AS] alias] lock_type
    [, tbl_name [[AS] alias] lock_type] ...

lock_type: {
    READ [LOCAL]
  | [LOW_PRIORITY] WRITE
}

UNLOCK {TABLE | TABLES}
```

MySQL enables client sessions to acquire table locks explicitly
for the purpose of cooperating with other sessions for access to
tables, or to prevent other sessions from modifying tables during
periods when a session requires exclusive access to them. A
session can acquire or release locks only for itself. One session
cannot acquire locks for another session or release locks held by
another session.

Locks may be used to emulate transactions or to get more speed
when updating tables. This is explained in more detail in
[Table-Locking Restrictions and Conditions](lock-tables.md#lock-tables-restrictions "Table-Locking Restrictions and Conditions").

[`LOCK TABLES`](lock-tables.md "15.3.6 LOCK TABLES and UNLOCK TABLES Statements") explicitly acquires
table locks for the current client session. Table locks can be
acquired for base tables or views. You must have the
[`LOCK TABLES`](privileges-provided.md#priv_lock-tables) privilege, and the
[`SELECT`](privileges-provided.md#priv_select) privilege for each object to
be locked.

For view locking, [`LOCK TABLES`](lock-tables.md "15.3.6 LOCK TABLES and UNLOCK TABLES Statements") adds
all base tables used in the view to the set of tables to be locked
and locks them automatically. For tables underlying any view being
locked, [`LOCK TABLES`](lock-tables.md "15.3.6 LOCK TABLES and UNLOCK TABLES Statements") checks that the
view definer (for `SQL SECURITY DEFINER` views)
or invoker (for all views) has the proper privileges on the
tables.

If you lock a table explicitly with [`LOCK
TABLES`](lock-tables.md "15.3.6 LOCK TABLES and UNLOCK TABLES Statements"), any tables used in triggers are also locked
implicitly, as described in
[LOCK TABLES and Triggers](lock-tables.md#lock-tables-and-triggers "LOCK TABLES and Triggers").

If you lock a table explicitly with [`LOCK
TABLES`](lock-tables.md "15.3.6 LOCK TABLES and UNLOCK TABLES Statements"), any tables related by a foreign key constraint
are opened and locked implicitly. For foreign key checks, a shared
read-only lock ([`LOCK
TABLES READ`](lock-tables.md "15.3.6 LOCK TABLES and UNLOCK TABLES Statements")) is taken on related tables. For cascading
updates, a shared-nothing write lock
([`LOCK TABLES
WRITE`](lock-tables.md "15.3.6 LOCK TABLES and UNLOCK TABLES Statements")) is taken on related tables that are involved in
the operation.

[`UNLOCK
TABLES`](lock-tables.md "15.3.6 LOCK TABLES and UNLOCK TABLES Statements") explicitly releases any table locks held by the
current session. [`LOCK TABLES`](lock-tables.md "15.3.6 LOCK TABLES and UNLOCK TABLES Statements")
implicitly releases any table locks held by the current session
before acquiring new locks.

Another use for
[`UNLOCK
TABLES`](lock-tables.md "15.3.6 LOCK TABLES and UNLOCK TABLES Statements") is to release the global read lock acquired with
the [`FLUSH TABLES WITH READ LOCK`](flush.md#flush-tables-with-read-lock)
statement, which enables you to lock all tables in all databases.
See [Section 15.7.8.3, “FLUSH Statement”](flush.md "15.7.8.3 FLUSH Statement"). (This is a very convenient way to get
backups if you have a file system such as Veritas that can take
snapshots in time.)

`LOCK TABLE` is a synonym for `LOCK
TABLES`; `UNLOCK TABLE` is a synonym for
`UNLOCK TABLES`.

A table lock protects only against inappropriate reads or writes
by other sessions. A session holding a `WRITE`
lock can perform table-level operations such as
[`DROP TABLE`](drop-table.md "15.1.32 DROP TABLE Statement") or
[`TRUNCATE TABLE`](truncate-table.md "15.1.37 TRUNCATE TABLE Statement"). For sessions
holding a `READ` lock, [`DROP
TABLE`](drop-table.md "15.1.32 DROP TABLE Statement") and [`TRUNCATE TABLE`](truncate-table.md "15.1.37 TRUNCATE TABLE Statement")
operations are not permitted.

The following discussion applies only to
non-`TEMPORARY` tables. [`LOCK
TABLES`](lock-tables.md "15.3.6 LOCK TABLES and UNLOCK TABLES Statements") is permitted (but ignored) for a
`TEMPORARY` table. The table can be accessed
freely by the session within which it was created, regardless of
what other locking may be in effect. No lock is necessary because
no other session can see the table.

- [Table-Locking Restrictions and Conditions](lock-tables.md#lock-tables-restrictions "Table-Locking Restrictions and Conditions")

#### Table Lock Acquisition

To acquire table locks within the current session, use the
[`LOCK TABLES`](lock-tables.md "15.3.6 LOCK TABLES and UNLOCK TABLES Statements") statement, which
acquires metadata locks (see
[Section 10.11.4, “Metadata Locking”](metadata-locking.md "10.11.4 Metadata Locking")).

The following lock types are available:

`READ [LOCAL]` lock:

- The session that holds the lock can read the table (but not
  write it).
- Multiple sessions can acquire a `READ` lock
  for the table at the same time.
- Other sessions can read the table without explicitly
  acquiring a `READ` lock.
- The `LOCAL` modifier enables nonconflicting
  [`INSERT`](insert.md "15.2.7 INSERT Statement") statements (concurrent
  inserts) by other sessions to execute while the lock is
  held. (See [Section 10.11.3, “Concurrent Inserts”](concurrent-inserts.md "10.11.3 Concurrent Inserts").) However,
  `READ LOCAL` cannot be used if you are
  going to manipulate the database using processes external to
  the server while you hold the lock. For
  `InnoDB` tables, `READ
  LOCAL` is the same as `READ`.

`[LOW_PRIORITY] WRITE` lock:

- The session that holds the lock can read and write the
  table.
- Only the session that holds the lock can access the table.
  No other session can access it until the lock is released.
- Lock requests for the table by other sessions block while
  the `WRITE` lock is held.
- The `LOW_PRIORITY` modifier has no effect.
  In previous versions of MySQL, it affected locking behavior,
  but this is no longer true. It is now deprecated and its use
  produces a warning. Use `WRITE` without
  `LOW_PRIORITY` instead.

`WRITE` locks normally have higher priority
than `READ` locks to ensure that updates are
processed as soon as possible. This means that if one session
obtains a `READ` lock and then another session
requests a `WRITE` lock, subsequent
`READ` lock requests wait until the session
that requested the `WRITE` lock has obtained
the lock and released it. (An exception to this policy can occur
for small values of the
[`max_write_lock_count`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_max_write_lock_count) system
variable; see [Section 10.11.4, “Metadata Locking”](metadata-locking.md "10.11.4 Metadata Locking").)

If the [`LOCK TABLES`](lock-tables.md "15.3.6 LOCK TABLES and UNLOCK TABLES Statements") statement must
wait due to locks held by other sessions on any of the tables,
it blocks until all locks can be acquired.

A session that requires locks must acquire all the locks that it
needs in a single [`LOCK TABLES`](lock-tables.md "15.3.6 LOCK TABLES and UNLOCK TABLES Statements")
statement. While the locks thus obtained are held, the session
can access only the locked tables. For example, in the following
sequence of statements, an error occurs for the attempt to
access `t2` because it was not locked in the
[`LOCK TABLES`](lock-tables.md "15.3.6 LOCK TABLES and UNLOCK TABLES Statements") statement:

```sql
mysql> LOCK TABLES t1 READ;
mysql> SELECT COUNT(*) FROM t1;
+----------+
| COUNT(*) |
+----------+
|        3 |
+----------+
mysql> SELECT COUNT(*) FROM t2;
ERROR 1100 (HY000): Table 't2' was not locked with LOCK TABLES
```

Tables in the `INFORMATION_SCHEMA` database are
an exception. They can be accessed without being locked
explicitly even while a session holds table locks obtained with
[`LOCK TABLES`](lock-tables.md "15.3.6 LOCK TABLES and UNLOCK TABLES Statements").

You cannot refer to a locked table multiple times in a single
query using the same name. Use aliases instead, and obtain a
separate lock for the table and each alias:

```sql
mysql> LOCK TABLE t WRITE, t AS t1 READ;
mysql> INSERT INTO t SELECT * FROM t;
ERROR 1100: Table 't' was not locked with LOCK TABLES
mysql> INSERT INTO t SELECT * FROM t AS t1;
```

The error occurs for the first
[`INSERT`](insert.md "15.2.7 INSERT Statement") because there are two
references to the same name for a locked table. The second
[`INSERT`](insert.md "15.2.7 INSERT Statement") succeeds because the
references to the table use different names.

If your statements refer to a table by means of an alias, you
must lock the table using that same alias. It does not work to
lock the table without specifying the alias:

```sql
mysql> LOCK TABLE t READ;
mysql> SELECT * FROM t AS myalias;
ERROR 1100: Table 'myalias' was not locked with LOCK TABLES
```

Conversely, if you lock a table using an alias, you must refer
to it in your statements using that alias:

```sql
mysql> LOCK TABLE t AS myalias READ;
mysql> SELECT * FROM t;
ERROR 1100: Table 't' was not locked with LOCK TABLES
mysql> SELECT * FROM t AS myalias;
```

#### Table Lock Release

When the table locks held by a session are released, they are
all released at the same time. A session can release its locks
explicitly, or locks may be released implicitly under certain
conditions.

- A session can release its locks explicitly with
  [`UNLOCK
  TABLES`](lock-tables.md "15.3.6 LOCK TABLES and UNLOCK TABLES Statements").
- If a session issues a [`LOCK
  TABLES`](lock-tables.md "15.3.6 LOCK TABLES and UNLOCK TABLES Statements") statement to acquire a lock while already
  holding locks, its existing locks are released implicitly
  before the new locks are granted.
- If a session begins a transaction (for example, with
  [`START
  TRANSACTION`](commit.md "15.3.1 START TRANSACTION, COMMIT, and ROLLBACK Statements")), an implicit
  [`UNLOCK
  TABLES`](lock-tables.md "15.3.6 LOCK TABLES and UNLOCK TABLES Statements") is performed, which causes existing locks
  to be released. (For additional information about the
  interaction between table locking and transactions, see
  [Interaction of Table Locking and Transactions](lock-tables.md#lock-tables-and-transactions "Interaction of Table Locking and Transactions").)

If the connection for a client session terminates, whether
normally or abnormally, the server implicitly releases all table
locks held by the session (transactional and nontransactional).
If the client reconnects, the locks are no longer in effect. In
addition, if the client had an active transaction, the server
rolls back the transaction upon disconnect, and if reconnect
occurs, the new session begins with autocommit enabled. For this
reason, clients may wish to disable auto-reconnect. With
auto-reconnect in effect, the client is not notified if
reconnect occurs but any table locks or current transaction are
lost. With auto-reconnect disabled, if the connection drops, an
error occurs for the next statement issued. The client can
detect the error and take appropriate action such as reacquiring
the locks or redoing the transaction. See
[Automatic Reconnection Control](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/c-api/8.0/en/c-api-auto-reconnect.html).

Note

If you use [`ALTER TABLE`](alter-table.md "15.1.9 ALTER TABLE Statement") on a
locked table, it may become unlocked. For example, if you
attempt a second [`ALTER TABLE`](alter-table.md "15.1.9 ALTER TABLE Statement")
operation, the result may be an error `Table
'tbl_name' was not locked with LOCK
TABLES`. To handle this, lock the table again prior
to the second alteration. See also
[Section B.3.6.1, “Problems with ALTER TABLE”](alter-table-problems.md "B.3.6.1 Problems with ALTER TABLE").

#### Interaction of Table Locking and Transactions

[`LOCK TABLES`](lock-tables.md "15.3.6 LOCK TABLES and UNLOCK TABLES Statements") and
[`UNLOCK
TABLES`](lock-tables.md "15.3.6 LOCK TABLES and UNLOCK TABLES Statements") interact with the use of transactions as
follows:

- [`LOCK TABLES`](lock-tables.md "15.3.6 LOCK TABLES and UNLOCK TABLES Statements") is not
  transaction-safe and implicitly commits any active
  transaction before attempting to lock the tables.
- [`UNLOCK
  TABLES`](lock-tables.md "15.3.6 LOCK TABLES and UNLOCK TABLES Statements") implicitly commits any active transaction,
  but only if [`LOCK TABLES`](lock-tables.md "15.3.6 LOCK TABLES and UNLOCK TABLES Statements") has
  been used to acquire table locks. For example, in the
  following set of statements,
  [`UNLOCK
  TABLES`](lock-tables.md "15.3.6 LOCK TABLES and UNLOCK TABLES Statements") releases the global read lock but does not
  commit the transaction because no table locks are in effect:

  ```sql
  FLUSH TABLES WITH READ LOCK;
  START TRANSACTION;
  SELECT ... ;
  UNLOCK TABLES;
  ```
- Beginning a transaction (for example, with
  [`START
  TRANSACTION`](commit.md "15.3.1 START TRANSACTION, COMMIT, and ROLLBACK Statements")) implicitly commits any current
  transaction and releases existing table locks.
- [`FLUSH TABLES WITH READ LOCK`](flush.md#flush-tables-with-read-lock)
  acquires a global read lock and not table locks, so it is
  not subject to the same behavior as
  [`LOCK TABLES`](lock-tables.md "15.3.6 LOCK TABLES and UNLOCK TABLES Statements") and
  [`UNLOCK
  TABLES`](lock-tables.md "15.3.6 LOCK TABLES and UNLOCK TABLES Statements") with respect to table locking and implicit
  commits. For example,
  [`START
  TRANSACTION`](commit.md "15.3.1 START TRANSACTION, COMMIT, and ROLLBACK Statements") does not release the global read lock.
  See [Section 15.7.8.3, “FLUSH Statement”](flush.md "15.7.8.3 FLUSH Statement").
- Other statements that implicitly cause transactions to be
  committed do not release existing table locks. For a list of
  such statements, see [Section 15.3.3, “Statements That Cause an Implicit Commit”](implicit-commit.md "15.3.3 Statements That Cause an Implicit Commit").
- The correct way to use [`LOCK
  TABLES`](lock-tables.md "15.3.6 LOCK TABLES and UNLOCK TABLES Statements") and
  [`UNLOCK
  TABLES`](lock-tables.md "15.3.6 LOCK TABLES and UNLOCK TABLES Statements") with transactional tables, such as
  `InnoDB` tables, is to begin a transaction
  with `SET autocommit = 0` (not
  [`START
  TRANSACTION`](commit.md "15.3.1 START TRANSACTION, COMMIT, and ROLLBACK Statements")) followed by [`LOCK
  TABLES`](lock-tables.md "15.3.6 LOCK TABLES and UNLOCK TABLES Statements"), and to not call
  [`UNLOCK
  TABLES`](lock-tables.md "15.3.6 LOCK TABLES and UNLOCK TABLES Statements") until you commit the transaction
  explicitly. For example, if you need to write to table
  `t1` and read from table
  `t2`, you can do this:

  ```sql
  SET autocommit=0;
  LOCK TABLES t1 WRITE, t2 READ, ...;
  ... do something with tables t1 and t2 here ...
  COMMIT;
  UNLOCK TABLES;
  ```

  When you call [`LOCK TABLES`](lock-tables.md "15.3.6 LOCK TABLES and UNLOCK TABLES Statements"),
  `InnoDB` internally takes its own table
  lock, and MySQL takes its own table lock.
  `InnoDB` releases its internal table lock
  at the next commit, but for MySQL to release its table lock,
  you have to call
  [`UNLOCK
  TABLES`](lock-tables.md "15.3.6 LOCK TABLES and UNLOCK TABLES Statements"). You should not have
  [`autocommit = 1`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_autocommit), because
  then `InnoDB` releases its internal table
  lock immediately after the call of [`LOCK
  TABLES`](lock-tables.md "15.3.6 LOCK TABLES and UNLOCK TABLES Statements"), and deadlocks can very easily happen.
  `InnoDB` does not acquire the internal
  table lock at all if [`autocommit =
  1`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_autocommit), to help old applications avoid unnecessary
  deadlocks.
- [`ROLLBACK`](commit.md "15.3.1 START TRANSACTION, COMMIT, and ROLLBACK Statements")
  does not release table locks.

#### LOCK TABLES and Triggers

If you lock a table explicitly with [`LOCK
TABLES`](lock-tables.md "15.3.6 LOCK TABLES and UNLOCK TABLES Statements"), any tables used in triggers are also locked
implicitly:

- The locks are taken as the same time as those acquired
  explicitly with the [`LOCK
  TABLES`](lock-tables.md "15.3.6 LOCK TABLES and UNLOCK TABLES Statements") statement.
- The lock on a table used in a trigger depends on whether the
  table is used only for reading. If so, a read lock suffices.
  Otherwise, a write lock is used.
- If a table is locked explicitly for reading with
  [`LOCK TABLES`](lock-tables.md "15.3.6 LOCK TABLES and UNLOCK TABLES Statements"), but needs to be
  locked for writing because it might be modified within a
  trigger, a write lock is taken rather than a read lock.
  (That is, an implicit write lock needed due to the table's
  appearance within a trigger causes an explicit read lock
  request for the table to be converted to a write lock
  request.)

Suppose that you lock two tables, `t1` and
`t2`, using this statement:

```sql
LOCK TABLES t1 WRITE, t2 READ;
```

If `t1` or `t2` have any
triggers, tables used within the triggers are also locked.
Suppose that `t1` has a trigger defined like
this:

```sql
CREATE TRIGGER t1_a_ins AFTER INSERT ON t1 FOR EACH ROW
BEGIN
  UPDATE t4 SET count = count+1
      WHERE id = NEW.id AND EXISTS (SELECT a FROM t3);
  INSERT INTO t2 VALUES(1, 2);
END;
```

The result of the [`LOCK TABLES`](lock-tables.md "15.3.6 LOCK TABLES and UNLOCK TABLES Statements")
statement is that `t1` and
`t2` are locked because they appear in the
statement, and `t3` and `t4`
are locked because they are used within the trigger:

- `t1` is locked for writing per the
  `WRITE` lock request.
- `t2` is locked for writing, even though the
  request is for a `READ` lock. This occurs
  because `t2` is inserted into within the
  trigger, so the `READ` request is converted
  to a `WRITE` request.
- `t3` is locked for reading because it is
  only read from within the trigger.
- `t4` is locked for writing because it might
  be updated within the trigger.

#### Table-Locking Restrictions and Conditions

You can safely use [`KILL`](kill.md "15.7.8.4 KILL Statement") to
terminate a session that is waiting for a table lock. See
[Section 15.7.8.4, “KILL Statement”](kill.md "15.7.8.4 KILL Statement").

[`LOCK TABLES`](lock-tables.md "15.3.6 LOCK TABLES and UNLOCK TABLES Statements") and
[`UNLOCK
TABLES`](lock-tables.md "15.3.6 LOCK TABLES and UNLOCK TABLES Statements") cannot be used within stored programs.

Tables in the `performance_schema` database
cannot be locked with [`LOCK
TABLES`](lock-tables.md "15.3.6 LOCK TABLES and UNLOCK TABLES Statements"), except the
`setup_xxx` tables.

The scope of a lock generated by `LOCK TABLES`
is a single MySQL server. It is not compatible with NDB Cluster,
which has no way of enforcing an SQL-level lock across multiple
instances of [**mysqld**](mysqld.md "6.3.1 mysqld — The MySQL Server"). You can enforce locking
in an API application instead. See
[Section 25.2.7.10, “Limitations Relating to Multiple NDB Cluster Nodes”](mysql-cluster-limitations-multiple-nodes.md "25.2.7.10 Limitations Relating to Multiple NDB Cluster Nodes"), for
more information.

The following statements are prohibited while a
[`LOCK TABLES`](lock-tables.md "15.3.6 LOCK TABLES and UNLOCK TABLES Statements") statement is in
effect: [`CREATE TABLE`](create-table.md "15.1.20 CREATE TABLE Statement"),
[`CREATE TABLE ...
LIKE`](create-table.md "15.1.20 CREATE TABLE Statement"), [`CREATE VIEW`](create-view.md "15.1.23 CREATE VIEW Statement"),
[`DROP VIEW`](drop-view.md "15.1.35 DROP VIEW Statement"), and DDL statements on
stored functions and procedures and events.

For some operations, system tables in the
`mysql` database must be accessed. For example,
the [`HELP`](help.md "15.8.3 HELP Statement") statement requires the
contents of the server-side help tables, and
[`CONVERT_TZ()`](date-and-time-functions.md#function_convert-tz) might need to read
the time zone tables. The server implicitly locks the system
tables for reading as necessary so that you need not lock them
explicitly. These tables are treated as just described:

```none
mysql.help_category
mysql.help_keyword
mysql.help_relation
mysql.help_topic
mysql.time_zone
mysql.time_zone_leap_second
mysql.time_zone_name
mysql.time_zone_transition
mysql.time_zone_transition_type
```

If you want to explicitly place a `WRITE` lock
on any of those tables with a [`LOCK
TABLES`](lock-tables.md "15.3.6 LOCK TABLES and UNLOCK TABLES Statements") statement, the table must be the only one
locked; no other table can be locked with the same statement.

Normally, you do not need to lock tables, because all single
[`UPDATE`](update.md "15.2.17 UPDATE Statement") statements are atomic; no
other session can interfere with any other currently executing
SQL statement. However, there are a few cases when locking
tables may provide an advantage:

- If you are going to run many operations on a set of
  `MyISAM` tables, it is much faster to lock
  the tables you are going to use. Locking
  `MyISAM` tables speeds up inserting,
  updating, or deleting on them because MySQL does not flush
  the key cache for the locked tables until
  [`UNLOCK
  TABLES`](lock-tables.md "15.3.6 LOCK TABLES and UNLOCK TABLES Statements") is called. Normally, the key cache is
  flushed after each SQL statement.

  The downside to locking the tables is that no session can
  update a `READ`-locked table (including the
  one holding the lock) and no session can access a
  `WRITE`-locked table other than the one
  holding the lock.
- If you are using tables for a nontransactional storage
  engine, you must use [`LOCK
  TABLES`](lock-tables.md "15.3.6 LOCK TABLES and UNLOCK TABLES Statements") if you want to ensure that no other session
  modifies the tables between a
  [`SELECT`](select.md "15.2.13 SELECT Statement") and an
  [`UPDATE`](update.md "15.2.17 UPDATE Statement"). The example shown
  here requires [`LOCK TABLES`](lock-tables.md "15.3.6 LOCK TABLES and UNLOCK TABLES Statements") to
  execute safely:

  ```sql
  LOCK TABLES trans READ, customer WRITE;
  SELECT SUM(value) FROM trans WHERE customer_id=some_id;
  UPDATE customer
    SET total_value=sum_from_previous_statement
    WHERE customer_id=some_id;
  UNLOCK TABLES;
  ```

  Without [`LOCK TABLES`](lock-tables.md "15.3.6 LOCK TABLES and UNLOCK TABLES Statements"), it is
  possible that another session might insert a new row in the
  `trans` table between execution of the
  [`SELECT`](select.md "15.2.13 SELECT Statement") and
  [`UPDATE`](update.md "15.2.17 UPDATE Statement") statements.

You can avoid using [`LOCK TABLES`](lock-tables.md "15.3.6 LOCK TABLES and UNLOCK TABLES Statements")
in many cases by using relative updates (`UPDATE
customer SET
value=value+new_value`)
or the [`LAST_INSERT_ID()`](information-functions.md#function_last-insert-id) function.

You can also avoid locking tables in some cases by using the
user-level advisory lock functions
[`GET_LOCK()`](locking-functions.md#function_get-lock) and
[`RELEASE_LOCK()`](locking-functions.md#function_release-lock). These locks are
saved in a hash table in the server and implemented with
`pthread_mutex_lock()` and
`pthread_mutex_unlock()` for high speed. See
[Section 14.14, “Locking Functions”](locking-functions.md "14.14 Locking Functions").

See [Section 10.11.1, “Internal Locking Methods”](internal-locking.md "10.11.1 Internal Locking Methods"), for more information on
locking policy.
