### 20.6.1 Communication Stack for Connection Security Management

From MySQL 8.0.27, Group Replication can secure group
communication connections between members by one of the following
methods:

- Using its own implementation of the security protocols,
  including TLS/SSL and the use of an allowlist for incoming
  Group Communication System (GCS) connections. This is the only
  option for MySQL 8.0.26 and earlier.
- Using MySQL Server’s own connection security in place of
  Group Replication’s implementation. Using the MySQL protocol
  means that standard methods of user authentication can be used
  for granting (or revoking) access to the group in place of the
  allowlist, and the latest functionality of the server’s
  protocol is always available on release. This option is
  available from MySQL 8.0.27.

The choice is made by setting the system variable
[`group_replication_communication_stack`](group-replication-system-variables.md#sysvar_group_replication_communication_stack)
to `XCOM` to use Group Replication's own
implementation (this is the default choice), or to
`MYSQL` to use MySQL Server's connection
security.

The following additional configuration is required for a
replication group to use the MySQL communication stack. It is
especially important to make sure these requirements are all
fulfilled when you switch from using the XCom communication stack
to the MySQL communication stack for your group.

**Group Replication Requirements For The MySQL Communication Stack**

- The network address configured by the
  [`group_replication_local_address`](group-replication-system-variables.md#sysvar_group_replication_local_address)
  system variable for each group member must be set to one of
  the IP addresses and ports that MySQL Server is listening on,
  as specified by the
  [`bind_address`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_bind_address) system variable
  for the server. The combination of IP address and port for
  each member must be unique in the group. It is recommended
  that the
  [`group_replication_group_seeds`](group-replication-system-variables.md#sysvar_group_replication_group_seeds)
  system variable for each group member be configured to contain
  all the local addresses for all the group members.
- The MySQL communication stack supports network namespaces,
  which the XCom communication stack does not support. If
  network namespaces are used with the Group Replication local
  addresses for the group members
  ([`group_replication_local_address`](group-replication-system-variables.md#sysvar_group_replication_local_address)),
  these must be configured for each group member using the
  [`CHANGE REPLICATION SOURCE TO`](change-replication-source-to.md "15.4.2.3 CHANGE REPLICATION SOURCE TO Statement")
  statement. Also, the
  [`report_host`](replication-options-replica.md#sysvar_report_host) server system
  variable for each group member must be set to report the
  namespace. All group members must use the same namespace to
  avoid possible issues with address resolution during
  distributed recovery.
- The
  [`group_replication_ssl_mode`](group-replication-system-variables.md#sysvar_group_replication_ssl_mode)
  system variable must be set to the required setting for group
  communications. This system variable controls whether TLS/SSL
  is enabled or disabled for group communications. For MySQL
  8.0.26 and earlier, the TLS/SSL configuration is always taken
  from the server’s SSL settings; for MySQL 8.0.27 and later,
  when the MySQL communication stack is used, the TLS/SSL
  configuration is taken from Group Replication’s distributed
  recovery settings. This setting should be the same on all the
  group members, to avoid potential conflicts.
- The settings for the [`--ssl`](server-options.md#option_mysqld_ssl) or
  [`--skip-ssl`](server-options.md#option_mysqld_ssl)
  server option and for the
  [`require_secure_transport`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_require_secure_transport)
  server system variable should be the same on all the group
  members, to avoid potential conflicts. If
  [`group_replication_ssl_mode`](group-replication-system-variables.md#sysvar_group_replication_ssl_mode) is
  set to `REQUIRED`,
  `VERIFY_CA`, or
  `VERIFY_IDENTITY`, use
  [`--ssl`](server-options.md#option_mysqld_ssl) and
  [`require_secure_transport=ON`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_require_secure_transport).
  If [`group_replication_ssl_mode`](group-replication-system-variables.md#sysvar_group_replication_ssl_mode)
  is set to `DISABLED`,
  use[`require_secure_transport=OFF`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_require_secure_transport).
- If TLS/SSL is enabled for group communications, Group
  Replication’s settings for securing distributed recovery
  must be configured if they are not already in place, or
  validated if they already are. The MySQL communication stack
  uses these settings not just for member-to-member distributed
  recovery connections, but also for TLS/SSL configuration in
  general group communications.
  [`group_replication_recovery_use_ssl`](group-replication-system-variables.md#sysvar_group_replication_recovery_use_ssl)
  and the other `group_replication_recovery_*`
  system variables are explained in
  [Section 20.6.3.2, “Secure Socket Layer (SSL) Connections for Distributed Recovery”](group-replication-configuring-ssl-for-recovery.md "20.6.3.2 Secure Socket Layer (SSL) Connections for Distributed Recovery").
- The Group Replication allowlist is not used when the group is
  using the MySQL communication stack, so the
  [`group_replication_ip_allowlist`](group-replication-system-variables.md#sysvar_group_replication_ip_allowlist)
  and
  [`group_replication_ip_whitelist`](group-replication-system-variables.md#sysvar_group_replication_ip_whitelist)
  system variables are ignored and need not be configured.
- The replication user account that Group Replication uses for
  distributed recovery, as configured using the
  [`CHANGE REPLICATION SOURCE TO`](change-replication-source-to.md "15.4.2.3 CHANGE REPLICATION SOURCE TO Statement")
  statement, is used for authentication by the MySQL
  communication stack when setting up Group Replication
  connections. This user account, which is the same on all group
  members, must be given the following privileges:

  - [`GROUP_REPLICATION_STREAM`](privileges-provided.md#priv_group-replication-stream).
    This privilege is required for the user account to be able
    to establish connections for Group Replication using the
    MySQL communication stack.
  - [`CONNECTION_ADMIN`](privileges-provided.md#priv_connection-admin). This
    privilege is required so that Group Replication
    connections are not terminated if one of the servers
    involved is placed in offline mode. If the MySQL
    communication stack is in use without this privilege, a
    member that is placed in offline mode is expelled from the
    group.

  These are in addition to the privileges
  [`REPLICATION SLAVE`](privileges-provided.md#priv_replication-slave) and
  [`BACKUP_ADMIN`](privileges-provided.md#priv_backup-admin) that all
  replication user accounts must have (see
  [Section 20.2.1.3, “User Credentials For Distributed Recovery”](group-replication-user-credentials.md "20.2.1.3 User Credentials For Distributed Recovery")). When
  you add the new privileges, ensure that you skip binary
  logging on each group member by issuing `SET
  SQL_LOG_BIN=0` before you issue the
  [`GRANT`](grant.md "15.7.1.6 GRANT Statement") statements, and
  `SET SQL_LOG_BIN=1` after them, so that the
  local transaction does not interfere with restarting Group
  Replication.

[`group_replication_communication_stack`](group-replication-system-variables.md#sysvar_group_replication_communication_stack)
is effectively a group-wide configuration setting, and the setting
must be the same on all group members. However, this is not
policed by Group Replication’s own checks for group-wide
configuration settings. A member with a different value from the
rest of the group cannot communicate with the other members at
all, because the communication protocols are incompatible, so it
cannot exchange information about its configuration settings.

This means that although the value of the system variable can be
changed while Group Replication is running, and takes effect after
you restart Group Replication on the group member, the member
still cannot rejoin the group until the setting has been changed
on all the members. You must therefore stop Group Replication on
all of the members and change the value of the system variable on
them all before you can restart the group. Because all of the
members are stopped, a full reboot of the group (a bootstrap by a
server with
[`group_replication_bootstrap_group=ON`](group-replication-system-variables.md#sysvar_group_replication_bootstrap_group))
is required in order for the value change to take effect. You can
make the other required changes to settings on the group members
while they are stopped.

For a running group, follow this procedure to change the value of
[`group_replication_communication_stack`](group-replication-system-variables.md#sysvar_group_replication_communication_stack)
and the other required settings to migrate a group from the XCom
communication stack to the MySQL communication stack, or from the
MySQL communication stack to the XCom communication stack:

1. Stop Group Replication on each of the group members, using a
   [`STOP GROUP_REPLICATION`](stop-group-replication.md "15.4.3.2 STOP GROUP_REPLICATION Statement")
   statement. Stop the primary member last, so that you do not
   trigger a new primary election and have to wait for that to
   complete.
2. On each of the group members, set the system variable
   [`group_replication_communication_stack`](group-replication-system-variables.md#sysvar_group_replication_communication_stack)
   to the new communication stack, `MYSQL` or
   `XCOM` as appropriate. You can do this by
   editing the MySQL Server configuration file (typically named
   `my.cnf` on Linux and Unix systems, or
   `my.ini` on Windows systems), or by using a
   [`SET`](set.md "13.3.6 The SET Type") statement. For example:

   ```sql
   SET PERSIST group_replication_communication_stack="MYSQL";
   ```
3. If you are migrating the replication group from the XCom
   communication stack (the default) to the MySQL communication
   stack, on each of the group members, configure or reconfigure
   the required system variables to appropriate settings, as
   described in the listing above. For example, the
   [`group_replication_local_address`](group-replication-system-variables.md#sysvar_group_replication_local_address)
   system variable must be set to one of the IP addresses and
   ports that MySQL Server is listening on. Also configure any
   network namespaces using a [`CHANGE
   REPLICATION SOURCE TO`](change-replication-source-to.md "15.4.2.3 CHANGE REPLICATION SOURCE TO Statement") statement.
4. If you are migrating the replication group from the XCom
   communication stack (the default) to the MySQL communication
   stack, on each of the group members, issue
   [`GRANT`](grant.md "15.7.1.6 GRANT Statement") statements to give the
   replication user account the
   [`GROUP_REPLICATION_STREAM`](privileges-provided.md#priv_group-replication-stream) and
   [`CONNECTION_ADMIN`](privileges-provided.md#priv_connection-admin) privileges.
   You will need to take the group members out of the read-only
   state that is applied when Group Replication is stopped. Also
   ensure that you skip binary logging on each group member by
   issuing `SET SQL_LOG_BIN=0` before you issue
   the [`GRANT`](grant.md "15.7.1.6 GRANT Statement") statements, and
   `SET SQL_LOG_BIN=1` after them, so that the
   local transaction does not interfere with restarting Group
   Replication. For example:

   ```sql
   SET GLOBAL SUPER_READ_ONLY=OFF;
   SET SQL_LOG_BIN=0;
   GRANT GROUP_REPLICATION_STREAM ON *.* TO rpl_user@'%';
   GRANT CONNECTION_ADMIN ON *.* TO rpl_user@'%';
   SET SQL_LOG_BIN=1;
   ```
5. If you are migrating the replication group from the MySQL
   communication stack back to the XCom communication stack, on
   each of the group members, reconfigure the system variables in
   the requirements listing above to settings suitable for the
   XCom communication stack.
   [Section 20.9, “Group Replication Variables”](group-replication-options.md "20.9 Group Replication Variables") lists the system
   variables with their defaults and requirements for the XCom
   communication stack.

   Note

   - The XCom communication stack does not support network
     namespaces, so the Group Replication local address
     ([`group_replication_local_address`](group-replication-system-variables.md#sysvar_group_replication_local_address)
     system variable) cannot use these. Unset them by issuing
     a [`CHANGE REPLICATION SOURCE
     TO`](change-replication-source-to.md "15.4.2.3 CHANGE REPLICATION SOURCE TO Statement") statement.
   - When you move back to the XCom communication stack, the
     settings specified by
     [`group_replication_recovery_use_ssl`](group-replication-system-variables.md#sysvar_group_replication_recovery_use_ssl)
     and the other
     `group_replication_recovery_*` system
     variables are not used to secure group communications.
     Instead, the Group Replication system variable
     [`group_replication_ssl_mode`](group-replication-system-variables.md#sysvar_group_replication_ssl_mode)
     is used to activate the use of SSL for group
     communication connections and specify the security mode
     for the connections, and the remainder of the
     configuration is taken from the server's SSL
     configuration. For details, see
     [Section 20.6.2, “Securing Group Communication Connections with Secure Socket Layer (SSL)”](group-replication-secure-socket-layer-support-ssl.md "20.6.2 Securing Group Communication Connections with Secure Socket Layer (SSL)").
6. To restart the group, follow the process in
   [Section 20.5.2, “Restarting a Group”](group-replication-restarting-group.md "20.5.2 Restarting a Group"), which
   explains how to safely bootstrap a group where transactions
   have been executed and certified. A bootstrap by a server with
   [`group_replication_bootstrap_group=ON`](group-replication-system-variables.md#sysvar_group_replication_bootstrap_group)
   is necessary to change the communication stack, because all of
   the members must be shut down.
7. Members now connect to each other using the new communication
   stack. Any server that has
   [`group_replication_communication_stack`](group-replication-system-variables.md#sysvar_group_replication_communication_stack)
   set (or defaulted, in the case of XCom) to the previous
   communication stack is no longer able to join the group. It is
   important to note that because Group Replication cannot even
   see the joining attempt, it does not check and reject the
   joining member with an error message. Instead, the attempted
   join fails silently when the previous communication stack
   gives up trying to contact the new one.
