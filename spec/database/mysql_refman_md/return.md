#### 15.6.5.7 RETURN Statement

```sql
RETURN expr
```

The [`RETURN`](return.md "15.6.5.7 RETURN Statement") statement terminates
execution of a stored function and returns the value
*`expr`* to the function caller. There
must be at least one [`RETURN`](return.md "15.6.5.7 RETURN Statement")
statement in a stored function. There may be more than one if
the function has multiple exit points.

This statement is not used in stored procedures, triggers, or
events. The [`LEAVE`](leave.md "15.6.5.4 LEAVE Statement") statement can
be used to exit a stored program of those types.
