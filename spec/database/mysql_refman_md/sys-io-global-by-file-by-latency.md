#### 30.4.3.12 The io\_global\_by\_file\_by\_latency and x$io\_global\_by\_file\_by\_latency Views

These views summarize global I/O consumers to display time
waiting for I/O, grouped by file. By default, rows are sorted
by descending total latency.

The [`io_global_by_file_by_latency`](sys-io-global-by-file-by-latency.md "30.4.3.12 The io_global_by_file_by_latency and x$io_global_by_file_by_latency Views")
and
[`x$io_global_by_file_by_latency`](sys-io-global-by-file-by-latency.md "30.4.3.12 The io_global_by_file_by_latency and x$io_global_by_file_by_latency Views")
views have these columns:

- `file`

  The file path name.
- `total`

  The total number of I/O events for the file.
- `total_latency`

  The total wait time of timed I/O events for the file.
- `count_read`

  The total number of read I/O events for the file.
- `read_latency`

  The total wait time of timed read I/O events for the file.
- `count_write`

  The total number of write I/O events for the file.
- `write_latency`

  The total wait time of timed write I/O events for the
  file.
- `count_misc`

  The total number of other I/O events for the file.
- `misc_latency`

  The total wait time of timed other I/O events for the
  file.
