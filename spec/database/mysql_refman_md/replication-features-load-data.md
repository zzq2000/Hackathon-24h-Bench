#### 19.5.1.19 Replication and LOAD DATA

[`LOAD DATA`](load-data.md "15.2.9 LOAD DATA Statement") is considered unsafe
for statement-based logging (see
[Section 19.2.1.3, “Determination of Safe and Unsafe Statements in Binary Logging”](replication-rbr-safe-unsafe.md "19.2.1.3 Determination of Safe and Unsafe Statements in Binary Logging")). When
[`binlog_format=MIXED`](replication-options-binary-log.md#sysvar_binlog_format) is set, the
statement is logged in row-based format. When
[`binlog_format=STATEMENT`](replication-options-binary-log.md#sysvar_binlog_format) is set,
note that [`LOAD DATA`](load-data.md "15.2.9 LOAD DATA Statement") does not
generate a warning, unlike other unsafe statements.

If you use [`LOAD DATA`](load-data.md "15.2.9 LOAD DATA Statement") with
[`binlog_format=STATEMENT`](replication-options-binary-log.md#sysvar_binlog_format), each
replica on which the changes are to be applied creates a
temporary file containing the data. The replica then uses a
[`LOAD DATA`](load-data.md "15.2.9 LOAD DATA Statement") statement to apply the
changes. This temporary file is not encrypted, even if binary
log encryption is active on the source, If encryption is
required, use row-based or mixed binary logging format instead,
for which replicas do not create the temporary file.

If a `PRIVILEGE_CHECKS_USER` account has been
used to help secure the replication channel (see
[Section 19.3.3, “Replication Privilege Checks”](replication-privilege-checks.md "19.3.3 Replication Privilege Checks")), it is strongly
recommended that you log [`LOAD
DATA`](load-data.md "15.2.9 LOAD DATA Statement") operations using row-based binary logging
([`binlog_format=ROW`](replication-options-binary-log.md#sysvar_binlog_format)). If
`REQUIRE_ROW_FORMAT` is set for the channel,
row-based binary logging is required. With this logging format,
the [`FILE`](privileges-provided.md#priv_file) privilege is not needed
to execute the event, so do not give the
`PRIVILEGE_CHECKS_USER` account this privilege.
If you need to recover from a replication error involving a
`LOAD DATA INFILE` operation logged in
statement format, and the replicated event is trusted, you could
grant the [`FILE`](privileges-provided.md#priv_file) privilege to the
`PRIVILEGE_CHECKS_USER` account temporarily,
removing it after the replicated event has been applied.

When [**mysqlbinlog**](mysqlbinlog.md "6.6.9 mysqlbinlog — Utility for Processing Binary Log Files") reads log events for
[`LOAD DATA`](load-data.md "15.2.9 LOAD DATA Statement") statements logged in
statement-based format, a generated local file is created in a
temporary directory. These temporary files are not automatically
removed by [**mysqlbinlog**](mysqlbinlog.md "6.6.9 mysqlbinlog — Utility for Processing Binary Log Files") or any other MySQL
program. If you do use [`LOAD DATA`](load-data.md "15.2.9 LOAD DATA Statement")
statements with statement-based binary logging, you should
delete the temporary files yourself after you no longer need the
statement log. For more information, see
[Section 6.6.9, “mysqlbinlog — Utility for Processing Binary Log Files”](mysqlbinlog.md "6.6.9 mysqlbinlog — Utility for Processing Binary Log Files").
