## 27.6 Stored Object Access Control

Stored programs (procedures, functions, triggers, and events) and
views are defined prior to use and, when referenced, execute
within a security context that determines their privileges. The
privileges applicable to execution of a stored object are
controlled by its `DEFINER` attribute and
`SQL SECURITY` characteristic.

- [The DEFINER Attribute](stored-objects-security.md#stored-objects-security-definer "The DEFINER Attribute")
- [The SQL SECURITY Characteristic](stored-objects-security.md#stored-objects-security-sql-security "The SQL SECURITY Characteristic")
- [Examples](stored-objects-security.md#stored-objects-security-examples "Examples")
- [Orphan Stored Objects](stored-objects-security.md#stored-objects-security-orphan-objects "Orphan Stored Objects")
- [Risk-Minimization Guidelines](stored-objects-security.md#stored-objects-security-guidelines "Risk-Minimization Guidelines")

### The DEFINER Attribute

A stored object definition can include a
`DEFINER` attribute that names a MySQL account.
If a definition omits the `DEFINER` attribute,
the default object definer is the user who creates it.

The following rules determine which accounts you can specify as
the `DEFINER` attribute for a stored object:

- If you have the [`SET_USER_ID`](privileges-provided.md#priv_set-user-id)
  privilege (or the deprecated
  [`SUPER`](privileges-provided.md#priv_super) privilege), you can
  specify any account as the `DEFINER`
  attribute. If the account does not exist, a warning is
  generated. Additionally, to set a stored object
  `DEFINER` attribute to an account that has
  the [`SYSTEM_USER`](privileges-provided.md#priv_system-user) privilege,
  you must have the [`SYSTEM_USER`](privileges-provided.md#priv_system-user)
  privilege.
- Otherwise, the only permitted account is your own, specified
  either literally or as
  [`CURRENT_USER`](information-functions.md#function_current-user) or
  [`CURRENT_USER()`](information-functions.md#function_current-user). You cannot
  set the definer to any other account.

Creating a stored object with a nonexistent
`DEFINER` account creates an orphan object,
which may have negative consequences; see
[Orphan Stored Objects](stored-objects-security.md#stored-objects-security-orphan-objects "Orphan Stored Objects").

### The SQL SECURITY Characteristic

For stored routines (procedures and functions) and views, the
object definition can include an `SQL SECURITY`
characteristic with a value of `DEFINER` or
`INVOKER` to specify whether the object
executes in definer or invoker context. If the definition omits
the `SQL SECURITY` characteristic, the default
is definer context.

Triggers and events have no `SQL SECURITY`
characteristic and always execute in definer context. The server
invokes these objects automatically as necessary, so there is no
invoking user.

Definer and invoker security contexts differ as follows:

- A stored object that executes in definer security context
  executes with the privileges of the account named by its
  `DEFINER` attribute. These privileges may
  be entirely different from those of the invoking user. The
  invoker must have appropriate privileges to reference the
  object (for example, [`EXECUTE`](privileges-provided.md#priv_execute)
  to call a stored procedure or
  [`SELECT`](privileges-provided.md#priv_select) to select from a
  view), but during object execution, the invoker's privileges
  are ignored and only the `DEFINER` account
  privileges matter. If the `DEFINER` account
  has few privileges, the object is correspondingly limited in
  the operations it can perform. If the
  `DEFINER` account is highly privileged
  (such as an administrative account), the object can perform
  powerful operations *no matter who invokes
  it.*
- A stored routine or view that executes in invoker security
  context can perform only operations for which the invoker
  has privileges. The `DEFINER` attribute has
  no effect on object execution.

### Examples

Consider the following stored procedure, which is declared with
`SQL SECURITY DEFINER` to execute in definer
security context:

```sql
CREATE DEFINER = 'admin'@'localhost' PROCEDURE p1()
SQL SECURITY DEFINER
BEGIN
  UPDATE t1 SET counter = counter + 1;
END;
```

Any user who has the [`EXECUTE`](privileges-provided.md#priv_execute)
privilege for `p1` can invoke it with a
[`CALL`](call.md "15.2.1 CALL Statement") statement. However, when
`p1` executes, it does so in definer security
context and thus executes with the privileges of
`'admin'@'localhost'`, the account named as its
`DEFINER` attribute. This account must have the
[`EXECUTE`](privileges-provided.md#priv_execute) privilege for
`p1` as well as the
[`UPDATE`](privileges-provided.md#priv_update) privilege for the table
`t1` referenced within the object body.
Otherwise, the procedure fails.

Now consider this stored procedure, which is identical to
`p1` except that its `SQL
SECURITY` characteristic is `INVOKER`:

```sql
CREATE DEFINER = 'admin'@'localhost' PROCEDURE p2()
SQL SECURITY INVOKER
BEGIN
  UPDATE t1 SET counter = counter + 1;
END;
```

Unlike `p1`, `p2` executes in
invoker security context and thus with the privileges of the
invoking user regardless of the `DEFINER`
attribute value. `p2` fails if the invoker
lacks the [`EXECUTE`](privileges-provided.md#priv_execute) privilege for
`p2` or the
[`UPDATE`](privileges-provided.md#priv_update) privilege for the table
`t1`.

### Orphan Stored Objects

An orphan stored object is one for which its
`DEFINER` attribute names a nonexistent
account:

- An orphan stored object can be created by specifying a
  nonexistent `DEFINER` account at
  object-creation time.
- An existing stored object can become orphaned through
  execution of a [`DROP USER`](drop-user.md "15.7.1.5 DROP USER Statement")
  statement that drops the object `DEFINER`
  account, or a [`RENAME USER`](rename-user.md "15.7.1.7 RENAME USER Statement")
  statement that renames the object `DEFINER`
  account.

An orphan stored object may be problematic in these ways:

- Because the `DEFINER` account does not
  exist, the object may not work as expected if it executes in
  definer security context:

  - For a stored routine, an error occurs at routine
    execution time if the `SQL SECURITY`
    value is `DEFINER` but the definer
    account does not exist.
  - For a trigger, it is not a good idea for trigger
    activation to occur until the account actually does
    exist. Otherwise, the behavior with respect to privilege
    checking is undefined.
  - For an event, an error occurs at event execution time if
    the account does not exist.
  - For a view, an error occurs when the view is referenced
    if the `SQL SECURITY` value is
    `DEFINER` but the definer account does
    not exist.
- The object may present a security risk if the nonexistent
  `DEFINER` account is subsequently
  re-created for a purpose unrelated to the object. In this
  case, the account “adopts” the object and, with
  the appropriate privileges, is able to execute it even if
  that is not intended.

As of MySQL 8.0.22, the server imposes additional
account-management security checks designed to prevent
operations that (perhaps inadvertently) cause stored objects to
become orphaned or that cause adoption of stored objects that
are currently orphaned:

- [`DROP USER`](drop-user.md "15.7.1.5 DROP USER Statement") fails with an error
  if any account to be dropped is named as the
  `DEFINER` attribute for any stored object.
  (That is, the statement fails if dropping an account would
  cause a stored object to become orphaned.)
- [`RENAME USER`](rename-user.md "15.7.1.7 RENAME USER Statement") fails with an
  error if any account to be renamed is named as the
  `DEFINER` attribute for any stored object.
  (That is, the statement fails if renaming an account would
  cause a stored object to become orphaned.)
- [`CREATE USER`](create-user.md "15.7.1.3 CREATE USER Statement") fails with an
  error if any account to be created is named as the
  `DEFINER` attribute for any stored object.
  (That is, the statement fails if creating an account would
  cause the account to adopt a currently orphaned stored
  object.)

In certain situations, it may be necessary to deliberately
execute those account-management statements even when they would
otherwise fail. To make this possible, if a user has the
[`SET_USER_ID`](privileges-provided.md#priv_set-user-id) privilege, that
privilege overrides the orphan object security checks and the
statements succeed with a warning rather than failing with an
error.

To obtain information about the accounts used as stored object
definers in a MySQL installation, query the
`INFORMATION_SCHEMA`.

This query identifies which
`INFORMATION_SCHEMA` tables describe objects
that have a `DEFINER` attribute:

```sql
mysql> SELECT TABLE_SCHEMA, TABLE_NAME FROM INFORMATION_SCHEMA.COLUMNS
       WHERE COLUMN_NAME = 'DEFINER';
+--------------------+------------+
| TABLE_SCHEMA       | TABLE_NAME |
+--------------------+------------+
| information_schema | EVENTS     |
| information_schema | ROUTINES   |
| information_schema | TRIGGERS   |
| information_schema | VIEWS      |
+--------------------+------------+
```

The result tells you which tables to query to discover which
stored object `DEFINER` values exist and which
objects have a particular `DEFINER` value:

- To identify which `DEFINER` values exist in
  each table, use these queries:

  ```sql
  SELECT DISTINCT DEFINER FROM INFORMATION_SCHEMA.EVENTS;
  SELECT DISTINCT DEFINER FROM INFORMATION_SCHEMA.ROUTINES;
  SELECT DISTINCT DEFINER FROM INFORMATION_SCHEMA.TRIGGERS;
  SELECT DISTINCT DEFINER FROM INFORMATION_SCHEMA.VIEWS;
  ```

  The query results are significant for any account displayed
  as follows:

  - If the account exists, dropping or renaming it causes
    stored objects to become orphaned. If you plan to drop
    or rename the account, consider first dropping its
    associated stored objects or redefining them to have a
    different definer.
  - If the account does not exist, creating it causes it to
    adopt currently orphaned stored objects. If you plan to
    create the account, consider whether the orphaned
    objects should be associated with it. If not, redefine
    them to have a different definer.

  To redefine an object with a different definer, you can use
  [`ALTER EVENT`](alter-event.md "15.1.3 ALTER EVENT Statement") or
  [`ALTER VIEW`](alter-view.md "15.1.11 ALTER VIEW Statement") to directly modify
  the `DEFINER` account of events and views.
  For stored procedures and functions and for triggers, you
  must drop the object and re-create it to assign a different
  `DEFINER` account
- To identify which objects have a given
  `DEFINER` account, use these queries,
  substituting the account of interest for
  `user_name@host_name`:

  ```sql
  SELECT EVENT_SCHEMA, EVENT_NAME FROM INFORMATION_SCHEMA.EVENTS
  WHERE DEFINER = 'user_name@host_name';
  SELECT ROUTINE_SCHEMA, ROUTINE_NAME, ROUTINE_TYPE
  FROM INFORMATION_SCHEMA.ROUTINES
  WHERE DEFINER = 'user_name@host_name';
  SELECT TRIGGER_SCHEMA, TRIGGER_NAME FROM INFORMATION_SCHEMA.TRIGGERS
  WHERE DEFINER = 'user_name@host_name';
  SELECT TABLE_SCHEMA, TABLE_NAME FROM INFORMATION_SCHEMA.VIEWS
  WHERE DEFINER = 'user_name@host_name';
  ```

  For the [`ROUTINES`](information-schema-routines-table.md "28.3.30 The INFORMATION_SCHEMA ROUTINES Table") table, the
  query includes the `ROUTINE_TYPE` column so
  that output rows distinguish whether the
  `DEFINER` is for a stored procedure or
  stored function.

  If the account you are searching for does not exist, any
  objects displayed by those queries are orphan objects.

### Risk-Minimization Guidelines

To minimize the risk potential for stored object creation and
use, follow these guidelines:

- Do not create orphan stored objects; that is, objects for
  which the `DEFINER` attribute names a
  nonexistent account. Do not cause stored objects to become
  orphaned by dropping or renaming an account named by the
  `DEFINER` attribute of any existing object.
- For a stored routine or view, use `SQL SECURITY
  INVOKER` in the object definition when possible so
  that it can be used only by users with permissions
  appropriate for the operations performed by the object.
- If you create definer-context stored objects while using an
  account that has the
  [`SET_USER_ID`](privileges-provided.md#priv_set-user-id) privilege (or the
  deprecated [`SUPER`](privileges-provided.md#priv_super) privilege),
  specify an explicit `DEFINER` attribute
  that names an account possessing only the privileges
  required for the operations performed by the object. Specify
  a highly privileged `DEFINER` account only
  when absolutely necessary.
- Administrators can prevent users from creating stored
  objects that specify highly privileged
  `DEFINER` accounts by not granting them the
  [`SET_USER_ID`](privileges-provided.md#priv_set-user-id) privilege (or the
  deprecated [`SUPER`](privileges-provided.md#priv_super) privilege).
- Definer-context objects should be written keeping in mind
  that they may be able to access data for which the invoking
  user has no privileges. In some cases, you can prevent
  references to these objects by not granting unauthorized
  users particular privileges:

  - A stored routine cannot be referenced by a user who does
    not have the [`EXECUTE`](privileges-provided.md#priv_execute)
    privilege for it.
  - A view cannot be referenced by a user who does not have
    the appropriate privilege for it
    ([`SELECT`](privileges-provided.md#priv_select) to select from
    it, [`INSERT`](privileges-provided.md#priv_insert) to insert into
    it, and so forth).

  However, no such control exists for triggers and events
  because they always execute in definer context. The server
  invokes these objects automatically as necessary, and users
  do not reference them directly:

  - A trigger is activated by access to the table with which
    it is associated, even ordinary table accesses by users
    with no special privileges.
  - An event is executed by the server on a scheduled basis.

  In both cases, if the `DEFINER` account is
  highly privileged, the object may be able to perform
  sensitive or dangerous operations. This remains true if the
  privileges needed to create the object are revoked from the
  account of the user who created it. Administrators should be
  especially careful about granting users object-creation
  privileges.
- By default, when a routine with the `SQL SECURITY
  DEFINER` characteristic is executed, MySQL Server
  does not set any active roles for the MySQL account named in
  the `DEFINER` clause, only the default
  roles. The exception is if the
  [`activate_all_roles_on_login`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_activate_all_roles_on_login)
  system variable is enabled, in which case MySQL Server sets
  all roles granted to the `DEFINER` user,
  including mandatory roles. Any privileges granted through
  roles are therefore not checked by default when the
  [`CREATE PROCEDURE`](create-procedure.md "15.1.17 CREATE PROCEDURE and CREATE FUNCTION Statements") or
  [`CREATE
  FUNCTION`](create-function.md "15.1.14 CREATE FUNCTION Statement") statement is issued. For stored programs,
  if execution should occur with roles different from the
  default, the program body can execute
  [`SET ROLE`](set-role.md "15.7.1.11 SET ROLE Statement") to activate the
  required roles. This must be done with caution since the
  privileges assigned to roles can be changed.
