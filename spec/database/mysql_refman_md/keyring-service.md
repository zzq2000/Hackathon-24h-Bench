#### 7.6.9.2 The Keyring Service

MySQL Server supports a keyring service that enables internal
components and plugins to securely store sensitive information
for later retrieval. MySQL distributions provide a keyring
interface that is accessible at two levels:

- At the SQL level, as a set of loadable functions that each
  map onto calls to the service routines.
- As a C language interface, callable as a plugin service from
  server plugins or loadable functions.

This section describes how to use the keyring service functions
to store, retrieve, and remove keys in the MySQL keyring
keystore. For information about the SQL interface that uses
functions, [Section 8.4.4.15, “General-Purpose Keyring Key-Management Functions”](keyring-functions-general-purpose.md "8.4.4.15 General-Purpose Keyring Key-Management Functions").
For general keyring information, see [Section 8.4.4, “The MySQL Keyring”](keyring.md "8.4.4 The MySQL Keyring").

The keyring service uses whatever underlying keyring plugin is
enabled, if any. If no keyring plugin is enabled, keyring
service calls fail.

A “record” in the keystore consists of data (the
key itself) and a unique identifier through which the key is
accessed. The identifier has two parts:

- `key_id`: The key ID or name.
  `key_id` values that begin with
  `mysql_` are reserved by MySQL Server.
- `user_id`: The session effective user ID.
  If there is no user context, this value can be
  `NULL`. The value need not actually be a
  “user”; the meaning depends on the application.

  Functions that implement the keyring function interface pass
  the value of [`CURRENT_USER()`](information-functions.md#function_current-user)
  as the `user_id` value to keyring service
  functions.

The keyring service functions have these characteristics in
common:

- Each function returns 0 for success, 1 for failure.
- The `key_id` and `user_id`
  arguments form a unique combination indicating which key in
  the keyring to use.
- The `key_type` argument provides additional
  information about the key, such as its encryption method or
  intended use.
- Keyring service functions treat key IDs, user names, types,
  and values as binary strings, so comparisons are
  case-sensitive. For example, IDs of `MyKey`
  and `mykey` refer to different keys.

These keyring service functions are available:

- `my_key_fetch()`

  Deobfuscates and retrieves a key from the keyring, along
  with its type. The function allocates the memory for the
  buffers used to store the returned key and key type. The
  caller should zero or obfuscate the memory when it is no
  longer needed, then free it.

  Syntax:

  ```c
  bool my_key_fetch(const char *key_id, const char **key_type,
                    const char* user_id, void **key, size_t *key_len)
  ```

  Arguments:

  - `key_id`, `user_id`:
    Null-terminated strings that as a pair form a unique
    identifier indicating which key to fetch.
  - `key_type`: The address of a buffer
    pointer. The function stores into it a pointer to a
    null-terminated string that provides additional
    information about the key (stored when the key was
    added).
  - `key`: The address of a buffer pointer.
    The function stores into it a pointer to the buffer
    containing the fetched key data.
  - `key_len`: The address of a variable
    into which the function stores the size in bytes of the
    `*key` buffer.

  Return value:

  Returns 0 for success, 1 for failure.
- `my_key_generate()`

  Generates a new random key of a given type and length and
  stores it in the keyring. The key has a length of
  `key_len` and is associated with the
  identifier formed from `key_id` and
  `user_id`. The type and length values must
  be consistent with the values supported by the underlying
  keyring plugin. See [Section 8.4.4.13, “Supported Keyring Key Types and Lengths”](keyring-key-types.md "8.4.4.13 Supported Keyring Key Types and Lengths").

  Syntax:

  ```c
  bool my_key_generate(const char *key_id, const char *key_type,
                       const char *user_id, size_t key_len)
  ```

  Arguments:

  - `key_id`, `user_id`:
    Null-terminated strings that as a pair form a unique
    identifier for the key to be generated.
  - `key_type`: A null-terminated string
    that provides additional information about the key.
  - `key_len`: The size in bytes of the key
    to be generated.

  Return value:

  Returns 0 for success, 1 for failure.
- `my_key_remove()`

  Removes a key from the keyring.

  Syntax:

  ```c
  bool my_key_remove(const char *key_id, const char* user_id)
  ```

  Arguments:

  - `key_id`, `user_id`:
    Null-terminated strings that as a pair form a unique
    identifier for the key to be removed.

  Return value:

  Returns 0 for success, 1 for failure.
- `my_key_store()`

  Obfuscates and stores a key in the keyring.

  Syntax:

  ```c
  bool my_key_store(const char *key_id, const char *key_type,
                    const char* user_id, void *key, size_t key_len)
  ```

  Arguments:

  - `key_id`, `user_id`:
    Null-terminated strings that as a pair form a unique
    identifier for the key to be stored.
  - `key_type`: A null-terminated string
    that provides additional information about the key.
  - `key`: The buffer containing the key
    data to be stored.
  - `key_len`: The size in bytes of the
    `key` buffer.

  Return value:

  Returns 0 for success, 1 for failure.
