Note

MySQL Enterprise Data Masking and De-Identification is an extension included in MySQL Enterprise Edition, a commercial product.
To learn more about commercial products,

MySQL Enterprise Edition provides data masking and de-identification capabilities:

- Transformation of existing data to mask it and remove
  identifying characteristics, such as changing all digits of a
  credit card number but the last four to `'X'`
  characters.
- Generation of random data, such as email addresses and payment
  card numbers.
- Substitution of data by data from dictionaries stored in the
  database. The dictionaries are easily replicated in a standard
  way. Administration is restricted to authorized users who are
  granted special privileges so that only they can create and
  modify the dictionaries.

Note

MySQL Enterprise Data Masking and De-Identification was implemented originally in MySQL 8.0.13 as a plugin
library. As of MySQL 8.0.33, MySQL Enterprise Edition also provides components to
access data masking and de-identification capabilities. For
information about the similarities and differences, see
[Table 8.45, “Comparison Between Data-Masking Components and Plugin Elements”](data-masking-components-vs-plugin.md#data-masking-component-vs-plugin "Table 8.45 Comparison Between Data-Masking Components and Plugin Elements").

If you are using MySQL Enterprise Data Masking and De-Identification for the first time, consider installing
the components for access to the ongoing enhancements only
available with component infrastructure.

The way that applications use these capabilities depends on the
purpose for which the data is used and who accesses it:

- Applications that use sensitive data may protect it by
  performing data masking and permitting use of partially masked
  data for client identification. Example: A call center may ask
  for clients to provide their last four Social Security Number
  digits.
- Applications that require properly formatted data, but not
  necessarily the original data, can synthesize sample data.
  Example: An application developer who is testing data validators
  but has no access to original data may synthesize random data
  with the same format.
- Applications that must substitute a real name with a dictionary
  term to protect to protect sensitive information, but still
  provide realistic content to application users. Example: A user
  in training who is restricted from viewing addresses gets a
  random term from dictionary `city names`
  instead of the real city name. A variant of this scenario may be
  that the real city name is replaced only if it exists in
  `usa_city_names`.

Example 1:

Medical research facilities can hold patient data that comprises a
mix of personal and medical data. This may include genetic sequences
(long strings), test results stored in JSON format, and other data
types. Although the data may be used mostly by automated analysis
software, access to genome data or test results of particular
patients is still possible. In such cases, data masking should be
used to render this information not personally identifiable.

Example 2:

A credit card processor company provides a set of services using
sensitive data, such as:

- Processing a large number of financial transactions per second.
- Storing a large amount of transaction-related data.
- Protecting transaction-related data with strict requirements for
  personal data.
- Handling client complaints about transactions using reversible
  or partially masked data.

A typical transaction may include many types of sensitive
information, including:

- Credit card number.
- Transaction type and amount.
- Merchant type.
- Transaction cryptogram (to confirm transaction legitimacy).
- Geolocation of GPS-equipped terminal (for fraud detection).

Those types of information may then be joined within a bank or other
card-issuing financial institution with client personal data, such
as:

- Full client name (either person or company).
- Address.
- Date of birth.
- Social Security number.
- Email address.
- Phone number.

Various employee roles within both the card processing company and
the financial institution require access to that data. Some of these
roles may require access only to masked data. Other roles may
require access to the original data on a case-to-case basis, which
is recorded in audit logs.

Masking and de-identification are core to regulatory compliance, so
MySQL Enterprise Data Masking and De-Identification can help application developers satisfy privacy
requirements:

- PCI – DSS: Payment Card Data.
- HIPAA: Privacy of Health Data, Health Information Technology for
  Economic and Clinical Health Act (HITECH Act).
- EU General Data Protection Directive (GDPR): Protection of
  Personal Data.
- Data Protection Act (UK): Protection of Personal Data.
- Sarbanes Oxley, GLBA, The USA Patriot Act, Identity Theft and
  Assumption Deterrence Act of 1998.
- FERPA – Student Data, NASD, CA SB1386 and AB 1950, State Data
  Protection Laws, Basel II.

how to install and use it, and provide reference information for its
