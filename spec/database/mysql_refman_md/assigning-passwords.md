### 8.2.14 Assigning Account Passwords

Required credentials for clients that connect to the MySQL server
can include a password. This section describes how to assign
passwords for MySQL accounts.

MySQL stores credentials in the `user` table in
the `mysql` system database. Operations that
assign or modify passwords are permitted only to users with the
[`CREATE USER`](privileges-provided.md#priv_create-user) privilege, or,
alternatively, privileges for the `mysql`
database ([`INSERT`](privileges-provided.md#priv_insert) privilege to
create new accounts, [`UPDATE`](privileges-provided.md#priv_update)
privilege to modify existing accounts). If the
[`read_only`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_read_only) system variable is
enabled, use of account-modification statements such as
[`CREATE USER`](create-user.md "15.7.1.3 CREATE USER Statement") or
[`ALTER USER`](alter-user.md "15.7.1.1 ALTER USER Statement") additionally requires
the [`CONNECTION_ADMIN`](privileges-provided.md#priv_connection-admin) privilege (or
the deprecated [`SUPER`](privileges-provided.md#priv_super) privilege).

The discussion here summarizes syntax only for the most common
password-assignment statements. For complete details on other
possibilities, see [Section 15.7.1.3, “CREATE USER Statement”](create-user.md "15.7.1.3 CREATE USER Statement"),
[Section 15.7.1.1, “ALTER USER Statement”](alter-user.md "15.7.1.1 ALTER USER Statement"), and [Section 15.7.1.10, “SET PASSWORD Statement”](set-password.md "15.7.1.10 SET PASSWORD Statement").

MySQL uses plugins to perform client authentication; see
[Section 8.2.17, “Pluggable Authentication”](pluggable-authentication.md "8.2.17 Pluggable Authentication"). In password-assigning
statements, the authentication plugin associated with an account
performs any hashing required of a cleartext password specified.
This enables MySQL to obfuscate passwords prior to storing them in
the `mysql.user` system table. For the statements
described here, MySQL automatically hashes the password specified.
There are also syntax for [`CREATE
USER`](create-user.md "15.7.1.3 CREATE USER Statement") and [`ALTER USER`](alter-user.md "15.7.1.1 ALTER USER Statement") that
permits hashed values to be specified literally. For details, see
the descriptions of those statements.

To assign a password when you create a new account, use
[`CREATE USER`](create-user.md "15.7.1.3 CREATE USER Statement") and include an
`IDENTIFIED BY` clause:

```sql
CREATE USER 'jeffrey'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'password';
```

[`CREATE USER`](create-user.md "15.7.1.3 CREATE USER Statement") also supports syntax
for specifying the account authentication plugin. See
[Section 15.7.1.3, “CREATE USER Statement”](create-user.md "15.7.1.3 CREATE USER Statement").

To assign or change a password for an existing account, use the
[`ALTER USER`](alter-user.md "15.7.1.1 ALTER USER Statement") statement with an
`IDENTIFIED BY` clause:

```sql
ALTER USER 'jeffrey'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'password';
```

If you are not connected as an anonymous user, you can change your
own password without naming your own account literally:

```sql
ALTER USER USER() IDENTIFIED BY 'password';
```

To change an account password from the command line, use the
[**mysqladmin**](mysqladmin.md "6.5.2 mysqladmin — A MySQL Server Administration Program") command:

```terminal
mysqladmin -u user_name -h host_name password "password"
```

The account for which this command sets the password is the one
with a row in the `mysql.user` system table that
matches *`user_name`* in the
`User` column and the client host *from
which you connect* in the `Host`
column.

Warning

Setting a password using [**mysqladmin**](mysqladmin.md "6.5.2 mysqladmin — A MySQL Server Administration Program") should be
considered *insecure*. On some systems, your
password becomes visible to system status programs such as
**ps** that may be invoked by other users to
display command lines. MySQL clients typically overwrite the
command-line password argument with zeros during their
initialization sequence. However, there is still a brief
interval during which the value is visible. Also, on some
systems this overwriting strategy is ineffective and the
password remains visible to **ps**. (SystemV Unix
systems and perhaps others are subject to this problem.)

If you are using MySQL Replication, be aware that, currently, a
password used by a replica as part of a
[`CHANGE REPLICATION SOURCE TO`](change-replication-source-to.md "15.4.2.3 CHANGE REPLICATION SOURCE TO Statement")
statement (from MySQL 8.0.23) or [`CHANGE
MASTER TO`](change-master-to.md "15.4.2.1 CHANGE MASTER TO Statement") statement (before MySQL 8.0.23) is effectively
limited to 32 characters in length; if the password is longer, any
excess characters are truncated. This is not due to any limit
imposed by MySQL Server generally, but rather is an issue specific
to MySQL Replication.
