#### B.3.2.2 Can't connect to [local] MySQL server

A MySQL client on Unix can connect to the
[**mysqld**](mysqld.md "6.3.1 mysqld — The MySQL Server") server in two different ways: By
using a Unix socket file to connect through a file in the file
system (default `/tmp/mysql.sock`), or by
using TCP/IP, which connects through a port number. A Unix
socket file connection is faster than TCP/IP, but can be used
only when connecting to a server on the same computer. A Unix
socket file is used if you do not specify a host name or if
you specify the special host name
`localhost`.

If the MySQL server is running on Windows, you can connect
using TCP/IP. If the server is started with the
[`named_pipe`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_named_pipe) system variable
enabled, you can also connect with named pipes if you run the
client on the host where the server is running. The name of
the named pipe is `MySQL` by default. If you
do not give a host name when connecting to
[**mysqld**](mysqld.md "6.3.1 mysqld — The MySQL Server"), a MySQL client first tries to
connect to the named pipe. If that does not work, it connects
to the TCP/IP port. You can force the use of named pipes on
Windows by using `.` as the host name.

The error (2002) `Can't connect to ...`
normally means that there is no MySQL server running on the
system or that you are using an incorrect Unix socket file
name or TCP/IP port number when trying to connect to the
server. You should also check that the TCP/IP port you are
using has not been blocked by a firewall or port blocking
service.

The error (2003) `Can't connect to MySQL server on
'server' (10061)`
indicates that the network connection has been refused. You
should check that there is a MySQL server running, that it has
network connections enabled, and that the network port you
specified is the one configured on the server.

Start by checking whether there is a process named
[**mysqld**](mysqld.md "6.3.1 mysqld — The MySQL Server") running on your server host. (Use
**ps xa | grep mysqld** on Unix or the Task
Manager on Windows.) If there is no such process, you should
start the server. See [Section 2.9.2, “Starting the Server”](starting-server.md "2.9.2 Starting the Server").

If a [**mysqld**](mysqld.md "6.3.1 mysqld — The MySQL Server") process is running, you can
check it by trying the following commands. The port number or
Unix socket file name might be different in your setup.
`host_ip` represents the IP address of the
machine where the server is running.

```terminal
$> mysqladmin version
$> mysqladmin variables
$> mysqladmin -h `hostname` version variables
$> mysqladmin -h `hostname` --port=3306 version
$> mysqladmin -h host_ip version
$> mysqladmin --protocol=SOCKET --socket=/tmp/mysql.sock version
```

Note the use of backticks rather than forward quotation marks
with the **hostname** command; these cause the
output of **hostname** (that is, the current
host name) to be substituted into the
[**mysqladmin**](mysqladmin.md "6.5.2 mysqladmin — A MySQL Server Administration Program") command. If you have no
**hostname** command or are running on Windows,
you can manually type the host name of your machine (without
backticks) following the `-h` option. You can
also try `-h 127.0.0.1` to connect with
TCP/IP to the local host.

Make sure that the server has not been configured to ignore
network connections or (if you are attempting to connect
remotely) that it has not been configured to listen only
locally on its network interfaces. If the server was started
with the [`skip_networking`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_skip_networking)
system variable enabled, it cannot accept TCP/IP connections
at all. If the server was started with the
[`bind_address`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_bind_address) system variable
set to `127.0.0.1`, it listens for TCP/IP
connections only locally on the loopback interface and does
not accept remote connections.

Check to make sure that there is no firewall blocking access
to MySQL. Your firewall may be configured on the basis of the
application being executed, or the port number used by MySQL
for communication (3306 by default). Under Linux or Unix,
check your IP tables (or similar) configuration to ensure that
the port has not been blocked. Under Windows, applications
such as ZoneAlarm or Windows Firewall may need to be
configured not to block the MySQL port.

Here are some reasons the `Can't connect to local
MySQL server` error might occur:

- [**mysqld**](mysqld.md "6.3.1 mysqld — The MySQL Server") is not running on the local
  host. Check your operating system's process list to ensure
  the [**mysqld**](mysqld.md "6.3.1 mysqld — The MySQL Server") process is present.
- You're running a MySQL server on Windows with many TCP/IP
  connections to it. If you're experiencing that quite often
  your clients get that error, you can find a workaround
  here:
  [Section B.3.2.2.1, “Connection to MySQL Server Failing on Windows”](can-not-connect-to-server.md#can-not-connect-to-server-on-windows "B.3.2.2.1 Connection to MySQL Server Failing on Windows").
- Someone has removed the Unix socket file that
  [**mysqld**](mysqld.md "6.3.1 mysqld — The MySQL Server") uses
  (`/tmp/mysql.sock` by default). For
  example, you might have a **cron** job that
  removes old files from the `/tmp`
  directory. You can always run [**mysqladmin
  version**](mysqladmin.md "6.5.2 mysqladmin — A MySQL Server Administration Program") to check whether the Unix socket file
  that [**mysqladmin**](mysqladmin.md "6.5.2 mysqladmin — A MySQL Server Administration Program") is trying to use really
  exists. The fix in this case is to change the
  **cron** job to not remove
  `mysql.sock` or to place the socket
  file somewhere else. See
  [Section B.3.3.6, “How to Protect or Change the MySQL Unix Socket File”](problems-with-mysql-sock.md "B.3.3.6 How to Protect or Change the MySQL Unix Socket File").
- You have started the [**mysqld**](mysqld.md "6.3.1 mysqld — The MySQL Server") server with
  the
  [`--socket=/path/to/socket`](server-options.md#option_mysqld_socket)
  option, but forgotten to tell client programs the new name
  of the socket file. If you change the socket path name for
  the server, you must also notify the MySQL clients. You
  can do this by providing the same
  [`--socket`](connection-options.md#option_general_socket) option when you
  run client programs. You also need to ensure that clients
  have permission to access the
  `mysql.sock` file. To find out where
  the socket file is, you can do:

  ```terminal
  $> netstat -ln | grep mysql
  ```

  See [Section B.3.3.6, “How to Protect or Change the MySQL Unix Socket File”](problems-with-mysql-sock.md "B.3.3.6 How to Protect or Change the MySQL Unix Socket File").
- You are using Linux and one server thread has died (dumped
  core). In this case, you must kill the other
  [**mysqld**](mysqld.md "6.3.1 mysqld — The MySQL Server") threads (for example, with
  [**kill**](kill.md "15.7.8.4 KILL Statement")) before you can restart the MySQL
  server. See [Section B.3.3.3, “What to Do If MySQL Keeps Crashing”](crashing.md "B.3.3.3 What to Do If MySQL Keeps Crashing").
- The server or client program might not have the proper
  access privileges for the directory that holds the Unix
  socket file or the socket file itself. In this case, you
  must either change the access privileges for the directory
  or socket file so that the server and clients can access
  them, or restart [**mysqld**](mysqld.md "6.3.1 mysqld — The MySQL Server") with a
  [`--socket`](server-options.md#option_mysqld_socket) option that
  specifies a socket file name in a directory where the
  server can create it and where client programs can access
  it.

If you get the error message `Can't connect to MySQL
server on some_host`, you can try the following
things to find out what the problem is:

- Check whether the server is running on that host by
  executing `telnet some_host 3306` and
  pressing the Enter key a couple of times. (3306 is the
  default MySQL port number. Change the value if your server
  is listening to a different port.) If there is a MySQL
  server running and listening to the port, you should get a
  response that includes the server's version number. If you
  get an error such as `telnet: Unable to connect to
  remote host: Connection refused`, then there is
  no server running on the given port.
- If the server is running on the local host, try using
  [**mysqladmin -h localhost variables**](mysqladmin.md "6.5.2 mysqladmin — A MySQL Server Administration Program") to
  connect using the Unix socket file. Verify the TCP/IP port
  number that the server is configured to listen to (it is
  the value of the [`port`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_port)
  variable.)
- If you are running under Linux and Security-Enhanced Linux
  (SELinux) is enabled, see [Section 8.7, “SELinux”](selinux.md "8.7 SELinux").

##### B.3.2.2.1 Connection to MySQL Server Failing on Windows

When you're running a MySQL server on Windows with many
TCP/IP connections to it, and you're experiencing that quite
often your clients get a `Can't connect to MySQL
server` error, the reason might be that Windows
does not allow for enough ephemeral (short-lived) ports to
serve those connections.

The purpose of `TIME_WAIT` is to keep a
connection accepting packets even after the connection has
been closed. This is because Internet routing can cause a
packet to take a slow route to its destination and it may
arrive after both sides have agreed to close. If the port is
in use for a new connection, that packet from the old
connection could break the protocol or compromise personal
information from the original connection. The
`TIME_WAIT` delay prevents this by ensuring
that the port cannot be reused until after some time has
been permitted for those delayed packets to arrive.

It is safe to reduce `TIME_WAIT` greatly on
LAN connections because there is little chance of packets
arriving at very long delays, as they could through the
Internet with its comparatively large distances and
latencies.

Windows permits ephemeral (short-lived) TCP ports to the
user. After any port is closed, it remains in a
`TIME_WAIT` status for 120 seconds. The
port is not available again until this time expires. The
default range of port numbers depends on the version of
Windows, with a more limited number of ports in older
versions:

- Windows through Server 2003: Ports in range
  1025–5000
- Windows Vista, Server 2008, and newer: Ports in range
  49152–65535

With a small stack of available TCP ports (5000) and a high
number of TCP ports being open and closed over a short
period of time along with the `TIME_WAIT`
status you have a good chance for running out of ports.
There are two ways to address this problem:

- Reduce the number of TCP ports consumed quickly by
  investigating connection pooling or persistent
  connections where possible
- Tune some settings in the Windows registry (see below)

Important

The following procedure involves modifying the Windows
registry. Before you modify the registry, make sure to
back it up and make sure that you understand how to
restore it if a problem occurs. For information about how
to back up, restore, and edit the registry, view the
following article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:
<http://support.microsoft.com/kb/256986/EN-US/>.

1. Start Registry Editor
   (`Regedt32.exe`).
2. Locate the following key in the registry:

   ```none
   HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\Tcpip\Parameters
   ```
3. On the `Edit` menu, click `Add
   Value`, and then add the following registry
   value:

   ```none
   Value Name: MaxUserPort
   Data Type: REG_DWORD
   Value: 65534
   ```

   This sets the number of ephemeral ports available to any
   user. The valid range is between 5000 and 65534
   (decimal). The default value is 0x1388 (5000 decimal).
4. On the `Edit` menu, click `Add
   Value`, and then add the following registry
   value:

   ```none
   Value Name: TcpTimedWaitDelay
   Data Type: REG_DWORD
   Value: 30
   ```

   This sets the number of seconds to hold a TCP port
   connection in `TIME_WAIT` state before
   closing. The valid range is between 30 and 300 decimal,
   although you may wish to check with Microsoft for the
   latest permitted values. The default value is 0x78 (120
   decimal).
5. Quit Registry Editor.
6. Reboot the machine.

Note: Undoing the above should be as simple as deleting the
registry entries you've created.
