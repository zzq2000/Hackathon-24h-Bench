#### 19.5.1.36 Replication and Triggers

With statement-based replication, triggers executed on the
source also execute on the replica. With row-based replication,
triggers executed on the source do not execute on the replica.
Instead, the row changes on the source resulting from trigger
execution are replicated and applied on the replica.

This behavior is by design. If under row-based replication the
replica applied the triggers as well as the row changes caused
by them, the changes would in effect be applied twice on the
replica, leading to different data on the source and the
replica.

If you want triggers to execute on both the source and the
replica, perhaps because you have different triggers on the
source and replica, you must use statement-based replication.
However, to enable replica-side triggers, it is not necessary to
use statement-based replication exclusively. It is sufficient to
switch to statement-based replication only for those statements
where you want this effect, and to use row-based replication the
rest of the time.

A statement invoking a trigger (or function) that causes an
update to an `AUTO_INCREMENT` column is not
replicated correctly using statement-based replication. MySQL
8.0 marks such statements as unsafe. (Bug #45677)

A trigger can have triggers for different combinations of
trigger event ([`INSERT`](insert.md "15.2.7 INSERT Statement"),
[`UPDATE`](update.md "15.2.17 UPDATE Statement"),
[`DELETE`](delete.md "15.2.2 DELETE Statement")) and action time
(`BEFORE`, `AFTER`), and
multiple triggers are permitted.

For brevity, “multiple triggers” here is shorthand
for “multiple triggers that have the same trigger event
and action time.”

**Upgrades.** Multiple triggers are
not supported in versions earlier than MySQL 5.7. If you upgrade
servers in a replication topology that use a version earlier
than MySQL 5.7, upgrade the replicas first and then upgrade the
source. If an upgraded replication source server still has old
replicas using MySQL versions that do not support multiple
triggers, an error occurs on those replicas if a trigger is
created on the source for a table that already has a trigger
with the same trigger event and action time.

**Downgrades.** If you downgrade a
server that supports multiple triggers to an older version that
does not, the downgrade has these effects:

- For each table that has triggers, all trigger definitions
  are in the `.TRG` file for the table.
  However, if there are multiple triggers with the same
  trigger event and action time, the server executes only one
  of them when the trigger event occurs. For information about
  `.TRG` files, see the Table Trigger Storage
  section of the MySQL Server Doxygen documentation, available
  at <https://dev.mysql.com/doc/index-other.html>.
- If triggers for the table are added or dropped subsequent to
  the downgrade, the server rewrites the table's
  `.TRG` file. The rewritten file retains
  only one trigger per combination of trigger event and action
  time; the others are lost.

To avoid these problems, modify your triggers before
downgrading. For each table that has multiple triggers per
combination of trigger event and action time, convert each such
set of triggers to a single trigger as follows:

1. For each trigger, create a stored routine that contains all
   the code in the trigger. Values accessed using
   `NEW` and `OLD` can be
   passed to the routine using parameters. If the trigger needs
   a single result value from the code, you can put the code in
   a stored function and have the function return the value. If
   the trigger needs multiple result values from the code, you
   can put the code in a stored procedure and return the values
   using `OUT` parameters.
2. Drop all triggers for the table.
3. Create one new trigger for the table that invokes the stored
   routines just created. The effect for this trigger is thus
   the same as the multiple triggers it replaces.
