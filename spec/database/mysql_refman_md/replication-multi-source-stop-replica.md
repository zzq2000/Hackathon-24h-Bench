#### 19.1.5.6 Stopping Multi-Source Replicas

The [`STOP REPLICA`](stop-replica.md "15.4.2.8 STOP REPLICA Statement") statement can be
used to stop a multi-source replica. By default, if you use the
[`STOP REPLICA`](stop-replica.md "15.4.2.8 STOP REPLICA Statement") statement on a
multi-source replica all channels are stopped. Optionally, use the
`FOR CHANNEL channel`
clause to stop only a specific channel.

- To stop all currently configured replication channels:

  ```sql
  mysql> STOP SLAVE;
  Or from MySQL 8.0.22:
  mysql> STOP REPLICA;
  ```
- To stop only a named channel, use a `FOR CHANNEL
  channel` clause:

  ```sql
  mysql> STOP SLAVE FOR CHANNEL "source_1";
  Or from MySQL 8.0.22:
  mysql> STOP REPLICA FOR CHANNEL "source_1";
  ```

For the full syntax of the [`STOP
REPLICA`](stop-replica.md "15.4.2.8 STOP REPLICA Statement") command and other available options, see
[Section 15.4.2.8, “STOP REPLICA Statement”](stop-replica.md "15.4.2.8 STOP REPLICA Statement").
