### 28.3.16 The INFORMATION\_SCHEMA KEY\_COLUMN\_USAGE Table

The [`KEY_COLUMN_USAGE`](information-schema-key-column-usage-table.md "28.3.16 The INFORMATION_SCHEMA KEY_COLUMN_USAGE Table") table describes
which key columns have constraints. This table provides no
information about functional key parts because they are
expressions and the table provides information only about columns.

The [`KEY_COLUMN_USAGE`](information-schema-key-column-usage-table.md "28.3.16 The INFORMATION_SCHEMA KEY_COLUMN_USAGE Table") table has these
columns:

- `CONSTRAINT_CATALOG`

  The name of the catalog to which the constraint belongs. This
  value is always `def`.
- `CONSTRAINT_SCHEMA`

  The name of the schema (database) to which the constraint
  belongs.
- `CONSTRAINT_NAME`

  The name of the constraint.
- `TABLE_CATALOG`

  The name of the catalog to which the table belongs. This value
  is always `def`.
- `TABLE_SCHEMA`

  The name of the schema (database) to which the table belongs.
- `TABLE_NAME`

  The name of the table that has the constraint.
- `COLUMN_NAME`

  The name of the column that has the constraint.

  If the constraint is a foreign key, then this is the column of
  the foreign key, not the column that the foreign key
  references.
- `ORDINAL_POSITION`

  The column's position within the constraint, not the column's
  position within the table. Column positions are numbered
  beginning with 1.
- `POSITION_IN_UNIQUE_CONSTRAINT`

  `NULL` for unique and primary-key
  constraints. For foreign-key constraints, this column is the
  ordinal position in key of the table that is being referenced.
- `REFERENCED_TABLE_SCHEMA`

  The name of the schema referenced by the constraint.
- `REFERENCED_TABLE_NAME`

  The name of the table referenced by the constraint.
- `REFERENCED_COLUMN_NAME`

  The name of the column referenced by the constraint.

Suppose that there are two tables name `t1` and
`t3` that have the following definitions:

```sql
CREATE TABLE t1
(
    s1 INT,
    s2 INT,
    s3 INT,
    PRIMARY KEY(s3)
) ENGINE=InnoDB;

CREATE TABLE t3
(
    s1 INT,
    s2 INT,
    s3 INT,
    KEY(s1),
    CONSTRAINT CO FOREIGN KEY (s2) REFERENCES t1(s3)
) ENGINE=InnoDB;
```

For those two tables, the
[`KEY_COLUMN_USAGE`](information-schema-key-column-usage-table.md "28.3.16 The INFORMATION_SCHEMA KEY_COLUMN_USAGE Table") table has two rows:

- One row with `CONSTRAINT_NAME` =
  `'PRIMARY'`, `TABLE_NAME` =
  `'t1'`, `COLUMN_NAME` =
  `'s3'`, `ORDINAL_POSITION` =
  `1`,
  `POSITION_IN_UNIQUE_CONSTRAINT` =
  `NULL`.

  For `NDB`: This value is always
  `NULL`.
- One row with `CONSTRAINT_NAME` =
  `'CO'`, `TABLE_NAME` =
  `'t3'`, `COLUMN_NAME` =
  `'s2'`, `ORDINAL_POSITION` =
  `1`,
  `POSITION_IN_UNIQUE_CONSTRAINT` =
  `1`.
