#### 30.4.3.30 The schema\_table\_statistics\_with\_buffer and x$schema\_table\_statistics\_with\_buffer Views

These views summarize table statistics, including
`InnoDB` buffer pool statistics. By default,
rows are sorted by descending total wait time (tables with
most contention first).

These views user a helper view,
`x$ps_schema_table_statistics_io`.

The
[`schema_table_statistics_with_buffer`](sys-schema-table-statistics-with-buffer.md "30.4.3.30 The schema_table_statistics_with_buffer and x$schema_table_statistics_with_buffer Views")
and
[`x$schema_table_statistics_with_buffer`](sys-schema-table-statistics-with-buffer.md "30.4.3.30 The schema_table_statistics_with_buffer and x$schema_table_statistics_with_buffer Views")
