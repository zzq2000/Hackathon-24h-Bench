#### B.3.4.8 Problems with Floating-Point Values

Floating-point numbers sometimes cause confusion because they
are approximate and not stored as exact values. A
floating-point value as written in an SQL statement may not be
the same as the value represented internally. Attempts to
treat floating-point values as exact in comparisons may lead
to problems. They are also subject to platform or
implementation dependencies. The
[`FLOAT`](floating-point-types.md "13.1.4 Floating-Point Types (Approximate Value) - FLOAT, DOUBLE") and
[`DOUBLE`](floating-point-types.md "13.1.4 Floating-Point Types (Approximate Value) - FLOAT, DOUBLE") data types are subject
to these issues. For [`DECIMAL`](fixed-point-types.md "13.1.3 Fixed-Point Types (Exact Value) - DECIMAL, NUMERIC")
columns, MySQL performs operations with a precision of 65
decimal digits, which should solve most common inaccuracy
problems.

The following example uses
[`DOUBLE`](floating-point-types.md "13.1.4 Floating-Point Types (Approximate Value) - FLOAT, DOUBLE") to demonstrate how
calculations that are done using floating-point operations are
subject to floating-point error.

```sql
mysql> CREATE TABLE t1 (i INT, d1 DOUBLE, d2 DOUBLE);
mysql> INSERT INTO t1 VALUES (1, 101.40, 21.40), (1, -80.00, 0.00),
    -> (2, 0.00, 0.00), (2, -13.20, 0.00), (2, 59.60, 46.40),
    -> (2, 30.40, 30.40), (3, 37.00, 7.40), (3, -29.60, 0.00),
    -> (4, 60.00, 15.40), (4, -10.60, 0.00), (4, -34.00, 0.00),
    -> (5, 33.00, 0.00), (5, -25.80, 0.00), (5, 0.00, 7.20),
    -> (6, 0.00, 0.00), (6, -51.40, 0.00);

mysql> SELECT i, SUM(d1) AS a, SUM(d2) AS b
    -> FROM t1 GROUP BY i HAVING a <> b;

+------+-------+------+
| i    | a     | b    |
+------+-------+------+
|    1 |  21.4 | 21.4 |
|    2 |  76.8 | 76.8 |
|    3 |   7.4 |  7.4 |
|    4 |  15.4 | 15.4 |
|    5 |   7.2 |  7.2 |
|    6 | -51.4 |    0 |
+------+-------+------+
```

The result is correct. Although the first five records look
like they should not satisfy the comparison (the values of
`a` and `b` do not appear to
be different), they may do so because the difference between
the numbers shows up around the tenth decimal or so, depending
on factors such as computer architecture or the compiler
version or optimization level. For example, different CPUs may
evaluate floating-point numbers differently.

If columns `d1` and `d2` had
been defined as [`DECIMAL`](fixed-point-types.md "13.1.3 Fixed-Point Types (Exact Value) - DECIMAL, NUMERIC") rather
than [`DOUBLE`](floating-point-types.md "13.1.4 Floating-Point Types (Approximate Value) - FLOAT, DOUBLE"), the result of the
[`SELECT`](select.md "15.2.13 SELECT Statement") query would have
contained only one row—the last one shown above.

The correct way to do floating-point number comparison is to
first decide on an acceptable tolerance for differences
between the numbers and then do the comparison against the
tolerance value. For example, if we agree that floating-point
numbers should be regarded the same if they are same within a
precision of one in ten thousand (0.0001), the comparison
should be written to find differences larger than the
tolerance value:

```sql
mysql> SELECT i, SUM(d1) AS a, SUM(d2) AS b FROM t1
    -> GROUP BY i HAVING ABS(a - b) > 0.0001;
+------+-------+------+
| i    | a     | b    |
+------+-------+------+
|    6 | -51.4 |    0 |
+------+-------+------+
1 row in set (0.00 sec)
```

Conversely, to get rows where the numbers are the same, the
test should find differences within the tolerance value:

```sql
mysql> SELECT i, SUM(d1) AS a, SUM(d2) AS b FROM t1
    -> GROUP BY i HAVING ABS(a - b) <= 0.0001;
+------+------+------+
| i    | a    | b    |
+------+------+------+
|    1 | 21.4 | 21.4 |
|    2 | 76.8 | 76.8 |
|    3 |  7.4 |  7.4 |
|    4 | 15.4 | 15.4 |
|    5 |  7.2 |  7.2 |
+------+------+------+
5 rows in set (0.03 sec)
```

Floating-point values are subject to platform or
implementation dependencies. Suppose that you execute the
following statements:

```sql
CREATE TABLE t1(c1 FLOAT(53,0), c2 FLOAT(53,0));
INSERT INTO t1 VALUES('1e+52','-1e+52');
SELECT * FROM t1;
```

On some platforms, the `SELECT` statement
returns `inf` and `-inf`. On
others, it returns `0` and
`-0`.

An implication of the preceding issues is that if you attempt
to create a replica by dumping table contents with
[**mysqldump**](mysqldump.md "6.5.4 mysqldump — A Database Backup Program") on the source and reloading the
dump file into the replica, tables containing floating-point
columns might differ between the two hosts.
