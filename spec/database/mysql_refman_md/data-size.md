### 10.4.1 Optimizing Data Size

Design your tables to minimize their space on the disk. This can
result in huge improvements by reducing the amount of data
written to and read from disk. Smaller tables normally require
less main memory while their contents are being actively
processed during query execution. Any space reduction for table
data also results in smaller indexes that can be processed
faster.

MySQL supports many different storage engines (table types) and
row formats. For each table, you can decide which storage and
indexing method to use. Choosing the proper table format for
your application can give you a big performance gain. See
[Chapter 17, *The InnoDB Storage Engine*](innodb-storage-engine.md "Chapter 17 The InnoDB Storage Engine"), and
[Chapter 18, *Alternative Storage Engines*](storage-engines.md "Chapter 18 Alternative Storage Engines").

You can get better performance for a table and minimize storage
space by using the techniques listed here:

- [Table Columns](data-size.md#data-size-table-columns "Table Columns")
- [Row Format](data-size.md#data-size-row-format "Row Format")
- [Indexes](data-size.md#data-size-indexes "Indexes")
- [Joins](data-size.md#data-size-joins "Joins")
- [Normalization](data-size.md#data-size-normalization "Normalization")

#### Table Columns

- Use the most efficient (smallest) data types possible.
  MySQL has many specialized types that save disk space and
  memory. For example, use the smaller integer types if
  possible to get smaller tables.
  [`MEDIUMINT`](integer-types.md "13.1.2 Integer Types (Exact Value) - INTEGER, INT, SMALLINT, TINYINT, MEDIUMINT, BIGINT") is often a better
  choice than [`INT`](integer-types.md "13.1.2 Integer Types (Exact Value) - INTEGER, INT, SMALLINT, TINYINT, MEDIUMINT, BIGINT") because a
  [`MEDIUMINT`](integer-types.md "13.1.2 Integer Types (Exact Value) - INTEGER, INT, SMALLINT, TINYINT, MEDIUMINT, BIGINT") column uses 25%
  less space.
- Declare columns to be `NOT NULL` if
  possible. It makes SQL operations faster, by enabling
  better use of indexes and eliminating overhead for testing
  whether each value is `NULL`. You also
  save some storage space, one bit per column. If you really
  need `NULL` values in your tables, use
  them. Just avoid the default setting that allows
  `NULL` values in every column.

#### Row Format

- `InnoDB` tables are created using the
  `DYNAMIC` row format by default. To use a
  row format other than `DYNAMIC`,
  configure
  [`innodb_default_row_format`](innodb-parameters.md#sysvar_innodb_default_row_format),
  or specify the `ROW_FORMAT` option
  explicitly in a [`CREATE
  TABLE`](create-table.md "15.1.20 CREATE TABLE Statement") or [`ALTER
  TABLE`](alter-table.md "15.1.9 ALTER TABLE Statement") statement.

  The compact family of row formats, which includes
  `COMPACT`, `DYNAMIC`,
  and `COMPRESSED`, decreases row storage
  space at the cost of increasing CPU use for some
  operations. If your workload is a typical one that is
  limited by cache hit rates and disk speed it is likely to
  be faster. If it is a rare case that is limited by CPU
  speed, it might be slower.

  The compact family of row formats also optimizes
  [`CHAR`](char.md "13.3.2 The CHAR and VARCHAR Types") column storage when
  using a variable-length character set such as
  `utf8mb3` or `utf8mb4`.
  With `ROW_FORMAT=REDUNDANT`,
  `CHAR(N)`
  occupies *`N`* × the maximum
  byte length of the character set. Many languages can be
  written primarily using single-byte
  `utf8mb3`or `utf8mb4`
  characters, so a fixed storage length often wastes space.
  With the compact family of rows formats,
  `InnoDB` allocates a variable amount of
  storage in the range of *`N`* to
  *`N`* × the maximum byte
  length of the character set for these columns by stripping
  trailing spaces. The minimum storage length is
  *`N`* bytes to facilitate in-place
  updates in typical cases. For more information, see
  [Section 17.10, “InnoDB Row Formats”](innodb-row-format.md "17.10 InnoDB Row Formats").
- To minimize space even further by storing table data in
  compressed form, specify
  `ROW_FORMAT=COMPRESSED` when creating
  `InnoDB` tables, or run the
  [**myisampack**](myisampack.md "6.6.6 myisampack — Generate Compressed, Read-Only MyISAM Tables") command on an existing
  `MyISAM` table.
  (`InnoDB` compressed tables are readable
  and writable, while `MyISAM` compressed
  tables are read-only.)
- For `MyISAM` tables, if you do not have
  any variable-length columns
  ([`VARCHAR`](char.md "13.3.2 The CHAR and VARCHAR Types"),
  [`TEXT`](blob.md "13.3.4 The BLOB and TEXT Types"), or
  [`BLOB`](blob.md "13.3.4 The BLOB and TEXT Types") columns), a fixed-size
  row format is used. This is faster but may waste some
  space. See [Section 18.2.3, “MyISAM Table Storage Formats”](myisam-table-formats.md "18.2.3 MyISAM Table Storage Formats"). You can
  hint that you want to have fixed length rows even if you
  have [`VARCHAR`](char.md "13.3.2 The CHAR and VARCHAR Types") columns with
  the [`CREATE TABLE`](create-table.md "15.1.20 CREATE TABLE Statement") option
  `ROW_FORMAT=FIXED`.

#### Indexes

- The primary index of a table should be as short as
  possible. This makes identification of each row easy and
  efficient. For `InnoDB` tables, the
  primary key columns are duplicated in each secondary index
  entry, so a short primary key saves considerable space if
  you have many secondary indexes.
- Create only the indexes that you need to improve query
  performance. Indexes are good for retrieval, but slow down
  insert and update operations. If you access a table mostly
  by searching on a combination of columns, create a single
  composite index on them rather than a separate index for
  each column. The first part of the index should be the
  column most used. If you *always* use
  many columns when selecting from the table, the first
  column in the index should be the one with the most
  duplicates, to obtain better compression of the index.
- If it is very likely that a long string column has a
  unique prefix on the first number of characters, it is
  better to index only this prefix, using MySQL's
  support for creating an index on the leftmost part of the
  column (see [Section 15.1.15, “CREATE INDEX Statement”](create-index.md "15.1.15 CREATE INDEX Statement")). Shorter
  indexes are faster, not only because they require less
  disk space, but because they also give you more hits in
  the index cache, and thus fewer disk seeks. See
  [Section 7.1.1, “Configuring the Server”](server-configuration.md "7.1.1 Configuring the Server").

#### Joins

- In some circumstances, it can be beneficial to split into
  two a table that is scanned very often. This is especially
  true if it is a dynamic-format table and it is possible to
  use a smaller static format table that can be used to find
  the relevant rows when scanning the table.
- Declare columns with identical information in different
  tables with identical data types, to speed up joins based
  on the corresponding columns.
- Keep column names simple, so that you can use the same
  name across different tables and simplify join queries.
  For example, in a table named `customer`,
  use a column name of `name` instead of
  `customer_name`. To make your names
  portable to other SQL servers, consider keeping them
  shorter than 18 characters.

#### Normalization

- Normally, try to keep all data nonredundant (observing
  what is referred to in database theory as
  third normal form).
  Instead of repeating lengthy values such as names and
  addresses, assign them unique IDs, repeat these IDs as
  needed across multiple smaller tables, and join the tables
  in queries by referencing the IDs in the join clause.
- If speed is more important than disk space and the
  maintenance costs of keeping multiple copies of data, for
  example in a business intelligence scenario where you
  analyze all the data from large tables, you can relax the
  normalization rules, duplicating information or creating
  summary tables to gain more speed.
