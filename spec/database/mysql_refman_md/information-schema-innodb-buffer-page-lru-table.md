### 28.4.3 The INFORMATION\_SCHEMA INNODB\_BUFFER\_PAGE\_LRU Table

The [`INNODB_BUFFER_PAGE_LRU`](information-schema-innodb-buffer-page-lru-table.md "28.4.3 The INFORMATION_SCHEMA INNODB_BUFFER_PAGE_LRU Table") table
provides information about the pages in the
`InnoDB` [buffer
pool](glossary.md#glos_buffer_pool "buffer pool"); in particular, how they are ordered in the LRU list
that determines which pages to
[evict](glossary.md#glos_eviction "eviction") from the buffer pool
when it becomes full.

The [`INNODB_BUFFER_PAGE_LRU`](information-schema-innodb-buffer-page-lru-table.md "28.4.3 The INFORMATION_SCHEMA INNODB_BUFFER_PAGE_LRU Table") table has
the same columns as the
[`INNODB_BUFFER_PAGE`](information-schema-innodb-buffer-page-table.md "28.4.2 The INFORMATION_SCHEMA INNODB_BUFFER_PAGE Table") table with a few
exceptions. It has `LRU_POSITION` and
`COMPRESSED` columns instead of
`BLOCK_ID` and `PAGE_STATE`
columns, and it does not include and `IS_STALE`
column.

For related usage information and examples, see
[Section 17.15.5, “InnoDB INFORMATION\_SCHEMA Buffer Pool Tables”](innodb-information-schema-buffer-pool-tables.md "17.15.5 InnoDB INFORMATION_SCHEMA Buffer Pool Tables").

Warning

Querying the [`INNODB_BUFFER_PAGE_LRU`](information-schema-innodb-buffer-page-lru-table.md "28.4.3 The INFORMATION_SCHEMA INNODB_BUFFER_PAGE_LRU Table")
table can affect performance. Do not query this table on a
production system unless you are aware of the performance impact
and have determined it to be acceptable. To avoid impacting
performance on a production system, reproduce the issue you want
to investigate and query buffer pool statistics on a test
instance.

The [`INNODB_BUFFER_PAGE_LRU`](information-schema-innodb-buffer-page-lru-table.md "28.4.3 The INFORMATION_SCHEMA INNODB_BUFFER_PAGE_LRU Table") table has

  value of `INDEX`. The column is
  `NULL` if the server has not yet accessed the
  table.

#### Notes

- This table is useful primarily for expert-level performance
  monitoring, or when developing performance-related extensions
  for MySQL.
- You must have the [`PROCESS`](privileges-provided.md#priv_process)
  privilege to query this table.
- Use the `INFORMATION_SCHEMA`
  [`COLUMNS`](information-schema-columns-table.md "28.3.8 The INFORMATION_SCHEMA COLUMNS Table") table or the
  [`SHOW COLUMNS`](show-columns.md "15.7.7.5 SHOW COLUMNS Statement") statement to view
  additional information about the columns of this table,
  including data types and default values.
- Querying this table can require MySQL to allocate a large
  block of contiguous memory, more than 64 bytes times the
  number of active pages in the buffer pool. This allocation
  could potentially cause an out-of-memory error, especially for
  systems with multi-gigabyte buffer pools.
- Querying this table requires MySQL to lock the data structure
  representing the buffer pool while traversing the LRU list,
  which can reduce concurrency, especially for systems with
  multi-gigabyte buffer pools.
- When tables, table rows, partitions, or indexes are deleted,
  associated pages remain in the buffer pool until space is
  required for other data. The
  [`INNODB_BUFFER_PAGE_LRU`](information-schema-innodb-buffer-page-lru-table.md "28.4.3 The INFORMATION_SCHEMA INNODB_BUFFER_PAGE_LRU Table") table
  reports information about these pages until they are evicted
  from the buffer pool. For more information about how the
  `InnoDB` manages buffer pool data, see
  [Section 17.5.1, “Buffer Pool”](innodb-buffer-pool.md "17.5.1 Buffer Pool").
