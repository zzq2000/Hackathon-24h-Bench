#### 12.14.4.2 LDML Syntax Supported in MySQL

This section describes the LDML syntax that MySQL recognizes.
This is a subset of the syntax described in the LDML
specification available at
<http://www.unicode.org/reports/tr35/>, which
should be consulted for further information. MySQL recognizes
a large enough subset of the syntax that, in many cases, it is
possible to download a collation definition from the Unicode
Common Locale Data Repository and paste the relevant part
(that is, the part between the
`<rules>` and
`</rules>` tags) into the MySQL
`Index.xml` file. The rules described here
are all supported except that character sorting occurs only at
the primary level. Rules that specify differences at secondary
or higher sort levels are recognized (and thus can be included
in collation definitions) but are treated as equality at the
primary level.

The MySQL server generates diagnostics when it finds problems
while parsing the `Index.xml` file. See
[Section 12.14.4.3, “Diagnostics During Index.xml Parsing”](collation-diagnostics.md "12.14.4.3 Diagnostics During Index.xml Parsing").

**Character Representation**

Characters named in LDML rules can be written literally or in
`\unnnn` format,
where *`nnnn`* is the hexadecimal
Unicode code point value. For example, `A`
and `á` can be written literally or as
`\u0041` and `\u00E1`.
Within hexadecimal values, the digits `A`
through `F` are not case-sensitive;
`\u00E1` and `\u00e1` are
equivalent. For UCA 4.0.0 collations, hexadecimal notation can
be used only for characters in the Basic Multilingual Plane,
not for characters outside the BMP range of
`0000` to `FFFF`. For UCA
5.2.0 collations, hexadecimal notation can be used for any
character.

The `Index.xml` file itself should be
written using UTF-8 encoding.

**Syntax Rules**

LDML has reset rules and shift rules to specify character
ordering. Orderings are given as a set of rules that begin
with a reset rule that establishes an anchor point, followed
by shift rules that indicate how characters sort relative to
the anchor point.

- A `<reset>` rule does not specify
  any ordering in and of itself. Instead, it
  “resets” the ordering for subsequent shift
  rules to cause them to be taken in relation to a given
  character. Either of the following rules resets subsequent
  shift rules to be taken in relation to the letter
  `'A'`:

  ```xml
  <reset>A</reset>

  <reset>\u0041</reset>
  ```
- The `<p>`,
  `<s>`, and
  `<t>` shift rules define primary,
  secondary, and tertiary differences of a character from
  another character:

  - Use primary differences to distinguish separate
    letters.
  - Use secondary differences to distinguish accent
    variations.
  - Use tertiary differences to distinguish lettercase
    variations.

  Either of these rules specifies a primary shift rule for
  the `'G'` character:

  ```xml
  <p>G</p>

  <p>\u0047</p>
  ```
- The `<i>` shift rule indicates that
  one character sorts identically to another. The following
  rules cause `'b'` to sort the same as
  `'a'`:

  ```xml
  <reset>a</reset>
  <i>b</i>
  ```
- Abbreviated shift syntax specifies multiple shift rules
  using a single pair of tags. The following table shows the
  correspondence between abbreviated syntax rules and the
  equivalent nonabbreviated rules.

  **Table 12.5 Abbreviated Shift Syntax**

  | Abbreviated Syntax | Nonabbreviated Syntax |
  | --- | --- |
  | `<pc>xyz</pc>` | `<p>x</p><p>y</p><p>z</p>` |
  | `<sc>xyz</sc>` | `<s>x</s><s>y</s><s>z</s>` |
  | `<tc>xyz</tc>` | `<t>x</t><t>y</t><t>z</t>` |
  | `<ic>xyz</ic>` | `<i>x</i><i>y</i><i>z</i>` |
- An expansion is a reset rule that establishes an anchor
  point for a multiple-character sequence. MySQL supports
  expansions 2 to 6 characters long. The following rules put
  `'z'` greater at the primary level than
  the sequence of three characters `'abc'`:

  ```xml
  <reset>abc</reset>
  <p>z</p>
  ```
- A contraction is a shift rule that sorts a
  multiple-character sequence. MySQL supports contractions 2
  to 6 characters long. The following rules put the sequence
  of three characters `'xyz'` greater at
  the primary level than `'a'`:

  ```xml
  <reset>a</reset>
  <p>xyz</p>
  ```
- Long expansions and long contractions can be used
  together. These rules put the sequence of three characters
  `'xyz'` greater at the primary level than
  the sequence of three characters `'abc'`:

  ```xml
  <reset>abc</reset>
  <p>xyz</p>
  ```
- Normal expansion syntax uses `<x>`
  plus `<extend>` elements to specify
  an expansion. The following rules put the character
  `'k'` greater at the secondary level than
  the sequence `'ch'`. That is,
  `'k'` behaves as if it expands to a
  character after `'c'` followed by
  `'h'`:

  ```xml
  <reset>c</reset>
  <x><s>k</s><extend>h</extend></x>
  ```

  This syntax permits long sequences. These rules sort the
  sequence `'ccs'` greater at the tertiary
  level than the sequence `'cscs'`:

  ```xml
  <reset>cs</reset>
  <x><t>ccs</t><extend>cs</extend></x>
  ```

  The LDML specification describes normal expansion syntax
  as “tricky.” See that specification for
  details.
- Previous context syntax uses `<x>`
  plus `<context>` elements to
  specify that the context before a character affects how it
  sorts. The following rules put `'-'`
  greater at the secondary level than
  `'a'`, but only when
  `'-'` occurs after
  `'b'`:

  ```xml
  <reset>a</reset>
  <x><context>b</context><s>-</s></x>
  ```
- Previous context syntax can include the
  `<extend>` element. These rules put
  `'def'` greater at the primary level than
  `'aghi'`, but only when
  `'def'` comes after
  `'abc'`:

  ```xml
  <reset>a</reset>
  <x><context>abc</context><p>def</p><extend>ghi</extend></x>
  ```
- Reset rules permit a `before` attribute.
  Normally, shift rules after a reset rule indicate
  characters that sort after the reset character. Shift
  rules after a reset rule that has the
  `before` attribute indicate characters
  that sort before the reset character. The following rules
  put the character `'b'` immediately
  before `'a'` at the primary level:

  ```xml
  <reset before="primary">a</reset>
  <p>b</p>
  ```

  Permissible `before` attribute values
  specify the sort level by name or the equivalent numeric
  value:

  ```xml
  <reset before="primary">
  <reset before="1">

  <reset before="secondary">
  <reset before="2">

  <reset before="tertiary">
  <reset before="3">
  ```
- A reset rule can name a logical reset position rather than
  a literal character:

  ```xml
  <first_tertiary_ignorable/>
  <last_tertiary_ignorable/>
  <first_secondary_ignorable/>
  <last_secondary_ignorable/>
  <first_primary_ignorable/>
  <last_primary_ignorable/>
  <first_variable/>
  <last_variable/>
  <first_non_ignorable/>
  <last_non_ignorable/>
  <first_trailing/>
  <last_trailing/>
  ```

  These rules put `'z'` greater at the
  primary level than nonignorable characters that have a
  Default Unicode Collation Element Table (DUCET) entry and
  that are not CJK:

  ```xml
  <reset><last_non_ignorable/></reset>
  <p>z</p>
  ```

  Logical positions have the code points shown in the
  following table.

  **Table 12.6 Logical Reset Position Code Points**

  | Logical Position | Unicode 4.0.0 Code Point | Unicode 5.2.0 Code Point |
  | --- | --- | --- |
  | `<first_non_ignorable/>` | U+02D0 | U+02D0 |
  | `<last_non_ignorable/>` | U+A48C | U+1342E |
  | `<first_primary_ignorable/>` | U+0332 | U+0332 |
  | `<last_primary_ignorable/>` | U+20EA | U+101FD |
  | `<first_secondary_ignorable/>` | U+0000 | U+0000 |
  | `<last_secondary_ignorable/>` | U+FE73 | U+FE73 |
  | `<first_tertiary_ignorable/>` | U+0000 | U+0000 |
  | `<last_tertiary_ignorable/>` | U+FE73 | U+FE73 |
  | `<first_trailing/>` | U+0000 | U+0000 |
  | `<last_trailing/>` | U+0000 | U+0000 |
  | `<first_variable/>` | U+0009 | U+0009 |
  | `<last_variable/>` | U+2183 | U+1D371 |
- The `<collation>` element permits a
  `shift-after-method` attribute that
  affects character weight calculation for shift rules. The
  attribute has these permitted values:

  - `simple`: Calculate character weights
    as for reset rules that do not have a
    `before` attribute. This is the
    default if the attribute is not given.
  - `expand`: Use expansions for shifts
    after reset rules.

  Suppose that `'0'` and
  `'1'` have weights of
  `0E29` and `0E2A` and we
  want to put all basic Latin letters between
  `'0'` and `'1'`:

  ```xml
  <reset>0</reset>
  <pc>abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz</pc>
  ```

  For simple shift mode, weights are calculated as follows:

  ```none
  'a' has weight 0E29+1
  'b' has weight 0E29+2
  'c' has weight 0E29+3
  ...
  ```

  However, there are not enough vacant positions to put 26
  characters between `'0'` and
  `'1'`. The result is that digits and
  letters are intermixed.

  To solve this, use
  `shift-after-method="expand"`. Then
  weights are calculated like this:

  ```none
  'a' has weight [0E29][233D+1]
  'b' has weight [0E29][233D+2]
  'c' has weight [0E29][233D+3]
  ...
  ```

  `233D` is the UCA 4.0.0 weight for
  character `0xA48C`, which is the last
  nonignorable character (a sort of the greatest character
  in the collation, excluding CJK). UCA 5.2.0 is similar but
  uses `3ACA`, for character
  `0x1342E`.

**MySQL-Specific LDML
Extensions**

An extension to LDML rules permits the
`<collation>` element to include an
optional `version` attribute in
`<collation>` tags to indicate the UCA
version on which the collation is based. If the
`version` attribute is omitted, its default
value is `4.0.0`. For example, this
specification indicates a collation that is based on UCA
5.2.0:

```xml
<collation id="nnn" name="utf8mb4_xxx_ci" version="5.2.0">
...
</collation>
```
