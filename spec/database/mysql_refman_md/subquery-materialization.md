#### 10.2.2.2 Optimizing Subqueries with Materialization

The optimizer uses materialization to enable more efficient
subquery processing. Materialization speeds up query execution
by generating a subquery result as a temporary table, normally
in memory. The first time MySQL needs the subquery result, it
materializes that result into a temporary table. Any
subsequent time the result is needed, MySQL refers again to
the temporary table. The optimizer may index the table with a
hash index to make lookups fast and inexpensive. The index
contains unique values to eliminate duplicates and make the
table smaller.

Subquery materialization uses an in-memory temporary table
when possible, falling back to on-disk storage if the table
becomes too large. See
[Section 10.4.4, “Internal Temporary Table Use in MySQL”](internal-temporary-tables.md "10.4.4 Internal Temporary Table Use in MySQL").

If materialization is not used, the optimizer sometimes
rewrites a noncorrelated subquery as a correlated subquery.
For example, the following `IN` subquery is
noncorrelated (*`where_condition`*
involves only columns from `t2` and not
`t1`):

```sql
SELECT * FROM t1
WHERE t1.a IN (SELECT t2.b FROM t2 WHERE where_condition);
```

The optimizer might rewrite this as an
`EXISTS` correlated subquery:

```sql
SELECT * FROM t1
WHERE EXISTS (SELECT t2.b FROM t2 WHERE where_condition AND t1.a=t2.b);
```

Subquery materialization using a temporary table avoids such
rewrites and makes it possible to execute the subquery only
once rather than once per row of the outer query.

For subquery materialization to be used in MySQL, the
[`optimizer_switch`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_optimizer_switch) system
variable [`materialization`](switchable-optimizations.md#optflag_materialization)
flag must be enabled. (See
[Section 10.9.2, “Switchable Optimizations”](switchable-optimizations.md "10.9.2 Switchable Optimizations").) With the
[`materialization`](switchable-optimizations.md#optflag_materialization) flag
enabled, materialization applies to subquery predicates that
appear anywhere (in the select list, `WHERE`,
`ON`, `GROUP BY`,
`HAVING`, or `ORDER BY`),
for predicates that fall into any of these use cases:

- The predicate has this form, when no outer expression
  *`oe_i`* or inner expression
  *`ie_i`* is nullable.
  *`N`* is 1 or larger.

  ```sql
  (oe_1, oe_2, ..., oe_N) [NOT] IN (SELECT ie_1, i_2, ..., ie_N ...)
  ```
- The predicate has this form, when there is a single outer
  expression *`oe`* and inner
  expression *`ie`*. The expressions
  can be nullable.

  ```sql
  oe [NOT] IN (SELECT ie ...)
  ```
- The predicate is `IN` or `NOT
  IN` and a result of `UNKNOWN`
  (`NULL`) has the same meaning as a result
  of `FALSE`.

The following examples illustrate how the requirement for
equivalence of `UNKNOWN` and
`FALSE` predicate evaluation affects whether
subquery materialization can be used. Assume that
*`where_condition`* involves columns
only from `t2` and not `t1`
so that the subquery is noncorrelated.

This query is subject to materialization:

```sql
SELECT * FROM t1
WHERE t1.a IN (SELECT t2.b FROM t2 WHERE where_condition);
```

Here, it does not matter whether the `IN`
predicate returns `UNKNOWN` or
`FALSE`. Either way, the row from
`t1` is not included in the query result.

An example where subquery materialization is not used is the
following query, where `t2.b` is a nullable
column:

```sql
SELECT * FROM t1
WHERE (t1.a,t1.b) NOT IN (SELECT t2.a,t2.b FROM t2
                          WHERE where_condition);
```

The following restrictions apply to the use of subquery
materialization:

- The types of the inner and outer expressions must match.
  For example, the optimizer might be able to use
  materialization if both expressions are integer or both
  are decimal, but cannot if one expression is integer and
  the other is decimal.
- The inner expression cannot be a
  [`BLOB`](blob.md "13.3.4 The BLOB and TEXT Types").

Use of [`EXPLAIN`](explain.md "15.8.2 EXPLAIN Statement") with a query
provides some indication of whether the optimizer uses
subquery materialization:

- Compared to query execution that does not use
  materialization, `select_type` may change
  from `DEPENDENT SUBQUERY` to
  `SUBQUERY`. This indicates that, for a
  subquery that would be executed once per outer row,
  materialization enables the subquery to be executed just
  once.
- For extended [`EXPLAIN`](explain.md "15.8.2 EXPLAIN Statement")
  output, the text displayed by a following
  [`SHOW WARNINGS`](show-warnings.md "15.7.7.42 SHOW WARNINGS Statement") includes
  `materialize` and
  `materialized-subquery`.

In MySQL 8.0.21 and later, MySQL can also apply subquery
materialization to a single-table
[`UPDATE`](update.md "15.2.17 UPDATE Statement") or
[`DELETE`](delete.md "15.2.2 DELETE Statement") statement that uses a
`[NOT] IN` or `[NOT] EXISTS`
subquery predicate, provided that the statement does not use
`ORDER BY` or `LIMIT`, and
that subquery materialization is allowed by an optimizer hint
or by the [`optimizer_switch`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_optimizer_switch)
setting.
