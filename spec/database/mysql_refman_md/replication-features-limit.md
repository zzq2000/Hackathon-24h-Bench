#### 19.5.1.18 Replication and LIMIT

Statement-based replication of `LIMIT` clauses
in [`DELETE`](delete.md "15.2.2 DELETE Statement"),
[`UPDATE`](update.md "15.2.17 UPDATE Statement"), and
[`INSERT ...
SELECT`](insert-select.md "15.2.7.1 INSERT ... SELECT Statement") statements is unsafe since the order of the
rows affected is not defined. (Such statements can be replicated
correctly with statement-based replication only if they also
contain an `ORDER BY` clause.) When such a
statement is encountered:

- When using `STATEMENT` mode, a warning that
  the statement is not safe for statement-based replication is
  now issued.

  When using `STATEMENT` mode, warnings are
  issued for DML statements containing
  `LIMIT` even when they also have an
  `ORDER BY` clause (and so are made
  deterministic). This is a known issue. (Bug #42851)
- When using `MIXED` mode, the statement is
  now automatically replicated using row-based mode.
