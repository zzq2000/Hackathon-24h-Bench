### 26.6.1 Partitioning Keys, Primary Keys, and Unique Keys

This section discusses the relationship of partitioning keys
with primary keys and unique keys. The rule governing this
relationship can be expressed as follows: All columns used in
the partitioning expression for a partitioned table must be part
of every unique key that the table may have.

In other words, *every unique key on the table must use
every column in the table's partitioning
expression*. (This also includes the table's
primary key, since it is by definition a unique key. This
particular case is discussed later in this section.) For
example, each of the following table creation statements is
invalid:

```sql
CREATE TABLE t1 (
    col1 INT NOT NULL,
    col2 DATE NOT NULL,
    col3 INT NOT NULL,
    col4 INT NOT NULL,
    UNIQUE KEY (col1, col2)
)
PARTITION BY HASH(col3)
PARTITIONS 4;

CREATE TABLE t2 (
    col1 INT NOT NULL,
    col2 DATE NOT NULL,
    col3 INT NOT NULL,
    col4 INT NOT NULL,
    UNIQUE KEY (col1),
    UNIQUE KEY (col3)
)
PARTITION BY HASH(col1 + col3)
PARTITIONS 4;
```

In each case, the proposed table would have at least one unique
key that does not include all columns used in the partitioning
expression.

Each of the following statements is valid, and represents one
way in which the corresponding invalid table creation statement
could be made to work:

```sql
CREATE TABLE t1 (
    col1 INT NOT NULL,
    col2 DATE NOT NULL,
    col3 INT NOT NULL,
    col4 INT NOT NULL,
    UNIQUE KEY (col1, col2, col3)
)
PARTITION BY HASH(col3)
PARTITIONS 4;

CREATE TABLE t2 (
    col1 INT NOT NULL,
    col2 DATE NOT NULL,
    col3 INT NOT NULL,
    col4 INT NOT NULL,
    UNIQUE KEY (col1, col3)
)
PARTITION BY HASH(col1 + col3)
PARTITIONS 4;
```

This example shows the error produced in such cases:

```sql
mysql> CREATE TABLE t3 (
    ->     col1 INT NOT NULL,
    ->     col2 DATE NOT NULL,
    ->     col3 INT NOT NULL,
    ->     col4 INT NOT NULL,
    ->     UNIQUE KEY (col1, col2),
    ->     UNIQUE KEY (col3)
    -> )
    -> PARTITION BY HASH(col1 + col3)
    -> PARTITIONS 4;
ERROR 1491 (HY000): A PRIMARY KEY must include all columns in the table's partitioning function
```

The [`CREATE TABLE`](create-table.md "15.1.20 CREATE TABLE Statement") statement fails
because both `col1` and `col3`
are included in the proposed partitioning key, but neither of
these columns is part of both of unique keys on the table. This
shows one possible fix for the invalid table definition:

```sql
mysql> CREATE TABLE t3 (
    ->     col1 INT NOT NULL,
    ->     col2 DATE NOT NULL,
    ->     col3 INT NOT NULL,
    ->     col4 INT NOT NULL,
    ->     UNIQUE KEY (col1, col2, col3),
    ->     UNIQUE KEY (col3)
    -> )
    -> PARTITION BY HASH(col3)
    -> PARTITIONS 4;
Query OK, 0 rows affected (0.05 sec)
```

In this case, the proposed partitioning key
`col3` is part of both unique keys, and the
table creation statement succeeds.

The following table cannot be partitioned at all, because there
is no way to include in a partitioning key any columns that
belong to both unique keys:

```sql
CREATE TABLE t4 (
    col1 INT NOT NULL,
    col2 INT NOT NULL,
    col3 INT NOT NULL,
    col4 INT NOT NULL,
    UNIQUE KEY (col1, col3),
    UNIQUE KEY (col2, col4)
);
```

Since every primary key is by definition a unique key, this
restriction also includes the table's primary key, if it
has one. For example, the next two statements are invalid:

```sql
CREATE TABLE t5 (
    col1 INT NOT NULL,
    col2 DATE NOT NULL,
    col3 INT NOT NULL,
    col4 INT NOT NULL,
    PRIMARY KEY(col1, col2)
)
PARTITION BY HASH(col3)
PARTITIONS 4;

CREATE TABLE t6 (
    col1 INT NOT NULL,
    col2 DATE NOT NULL,
    col3 INT NOT NULL,
    col4 INT NOT NULL,
    PRIMARY KEY(col1, col3),
    UNIQUE KEY(col2)
)
PARTITION BY HASH( YEAR(col2) )
PARTITIONS 4;
```

In both cases, the primary key does not include all columns
referenced in the partitioning expression. However, both of the
next two statements are valid:

```sql
CREATE TABLE t7 (
    col1 INT NOT NULL,
    col2 DATE NOT NULL,
    col3 INT NOT NULL,
    col4 INT NOT NULL,
    PRIMARY KEY(col1, col2)
)
PARTITION BY HASH(col1 + YEAR(col2))
PARTITIONS 4;

CREATE TABLE t8 (
    col1 INT NOT NULL,
    col2 DATE NOT NULL,
    col3 INT NOT NULL,
    col4 INT NOT NULL,
    PRIMARY KEY(col1, col2, col4),
    UNIQUE KEY(col2, col1)
)
PARTITION BY HASH(col1 + YEAR(col2))
PARTITIONS 4;
```

If a table has no unique keys—this includes having no
primary key—then this restriction does not apply, and you
may use any column or columns in the partitioning expression as
long as the column type is compatible with the partitioning
type.

For the same reason, you cannot later add a unique key to a
partitioned table unless the key includes all columns used by
the table's partitioning expression. Consider the partitioned
table created as shown here:

```sql
mysql> CREATE TABLE t_no_pk (c1 INT, c2 INT)
    ->     PARTITION BY RANGE(c1) (
    ->         PARTITION p0 VALUES LESS THAN (10),
    ->         PARTITION p1 VALUES LESS THAN (20),
    ->         PARTITION p2 VALUES LESS THAN (30),
    ->         PARTITION p3 VALUES LESS THAN (40)
    ->     );
Query OK, 0 rows affected (0.12 sec)
```

It is possible to add a primary key to
`t_no_pk` using either of these
[`ALTER
TABLE`](alter-table-partition-operations.md "15.1.9.1 ALTER TABLE Partition Operations") statements:

```sql
#  possible PK
mysql> ALTER TABLE t_no_pk ADD PRIMARY KEY(c1);
Query OK, 0 rows affected (0.13 sec)
Records: 0  Duplicates: 0  Warnings: 0

# drop this PK
mysql> ALTER TABLE t_no_pk DROP PRIMARY KEY;
Query OK, 0 rows affected (0.10 sec)
Records: 0  Duplicates: 0  Warnings: 0

#  use another possible PK
mysql> ALTER TABLE t_no_pk ADD PRIMARY KEY(c1, c2);
Query OK, 0 rows affected (0.12 sec)
Records: 0  Duplicates: 0  Warnings: 0

# drop this PK
mysql> ALTER TABLE t_no_pk DROP PRIMARY KEY;
Query OK, 0 rows affected (0.09 sec)
Records: 0  Duplicates: 0  Warnings: 0
```

However, the next statement fails, because `c1`
is part of the partitioning key, but is not part of the proposed
primary key:

```sql
#  fails with error 1503
mysql> ALTER TABLE t_no_pk ADD PRIMARY KEY(c2);
ERROR 1503 (HY000): A PRIMARY KEY must include all columns in the table's partitioning function
```

Since `t_no_pk` has only `c1`
in its partitioning expression, attempting to adding a unique
key on `c2` alone fails. However, you can add a
unique key that uses both `c1` and
`c2`.

These rules also apply to existing nonpartitioned tables that
you wish to partition using
[`ALTER
TABLE ... PARTITION BY`](alter-table-partition-operations.md "15.1.9.1 ALTER TABLE Partition Operations"). Consider a table
`np_pk` created as shown here:

```sql
mysql> CREATE TABLE np_pk (
    ->     id INT NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT,
    ->     name VARCHAR(50),
    ->     added DATE,
    ->     PRIMARY KEY (id)
    -> );
Query OK, 0 rows affected (0.08 sec)
```

The following
[`ALTER
TABLE`](alter-table-partition-operations.md "15.1.9.1 ALTER TABLE Partition Operations") statement fails with an error, because the
`added` column is not part of any unique key in
the table:

```sql
mysql> ALTER TABLE np_pk
    ->     PARTITION BY HASH( TO_DAYS(added) )
    ->     PARTITIONS 4;
ERROR 1503 (HY000): A PRIMARY KEY must include all columns in the table's partitioning function
```

However, this statement using the `id` column
for the partitioning column is valid, as shown here:

```sql
mysql> ALTER TABLE np_pk
    ->     PARTITION BY HASH(id)
    ->     PARTITIONS 4;
Query OK, 0 rows affected (0.11 sec)
Records: 0  Duplicates: 0  Warnings: 0
```

In the case of `np_pk`, the only column that
may be used as part of a partitioning expression is
`id`; if you wish to partition this table using
any other column or columns in the partitioning expression, you
must first modify the table, either by adding the desired column
or columns to the primary key, or by dropping the primary key
altogether.
