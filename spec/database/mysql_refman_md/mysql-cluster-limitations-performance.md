#### 25.2.7.7 Limitations Relating to Performance in NDB Cluster

The following performance issues are specific to or especially
pronounced in NDB Cluster:

- **Range scans.**
  There are query performance issues due to sequential
  access to the [`NDB`](mysql-cluster.md "Chapter 25 MySQL NDB Cluster 8.0") storage
  engine; it is also relatively more expensive to do many
  range scans than it is with either
  `MyISAM` or `InnoDB`.
- **Reliability of Records in range.**
  The `Records in range` statistic is
  available but is not completely tested or officially
  supported. This may result in nonoptimal query plans in
  some cases. If necessary, you can employ `USE
  INDEX` or `FORCE INDEX` to alter
  the execution plan. See [Section 10.9.4, “Index Hints”](index-hints.md "10.9.4 Index Hints"), for
  more information on how to do this.
- **Unique hash indexes.**
  Unique hash indexes created with `USING
  HASH` cannot be used for accessing a table if
  `NULL` is given as part of the key.
