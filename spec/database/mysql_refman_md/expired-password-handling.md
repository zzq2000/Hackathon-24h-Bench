### 8.2.16 Server Handling of Expired Passwords

MySQL provides password-expiration capability, which enables
database administrators to require that users reset their
password. Passwords can be expired manually, and on the basis of a
policy for automatic expiration (see
[Section 8.2.15, “Password Management”](password-management.md "8.2.15 Password Management")).

The [`ALTER USER`](alter-user.md "15.7.1.1 ALTER USER Statement") statement enables
account password expiration. For example:

```sql
ALTER USER 'myuser'@'localhost' PASSWORD EXPIRE;
```

For each connection that uses an account with an expired password,
the server either disconnects the client or restricts the client
to “sandbox mode,” in which the server permits the
client to perform only those operations necessary to reset the
expired password. Which action is taken by the server depends on
both client and server settings, as discussed later.

If the server disconnects the client, it returns an
[`ER_MUST_CHANGE_PASSWORD_LOGIN`](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/mysql-errors/8.0/en/server-error-reference.html#error_er_must_change_password_login)
error:

```terminal
$> mysql -u myuser -p
Password: ******
ERROR 1862 (HY000): Your password has expired. To log in you must
change it using a client that supports expired passwords.
```

If the server restricts the client to sandbox mode, these
operations are permitted within the client session:

- The client can reset the account password with
  [`ALTER USER`](alter-user.md "15.7.1.1 ALTER USER Statement") or
  [`SET PASSWORD`](set-password.md "15.7.1.10 SET PASSWORD Statement"). After that has
  been done, the server restores normal access for the session,
  as well as for subsequent connections that use the account.

  Note

  Although it is possible to “reset” an expired
  password by setting it to its current value, it is
  preferable, as a matter of good policy, to choose a
  different password. DBAs can enforce non-reuse by
  establishing an appropriate password-reuse policy. See
  [Password Reuse Policy](password-management.md#password-reuse-policy "Password Reuse Policy").
- Prior to MySQL 8.0.27, the client can use the
  [`SET`](set-variable.md "15.7.6.1 SET Syntax for Variable Assignment")
  statement. As of MySQL 8.0.27, this is no longer permitted.

For any operation not permitted within the session, the server
returns an [`ER_MUST_CHANGE_PASSWORD`](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/mysql-errors/8.0/en/server-error-reference.html#error_er_must_change_password)
error:

```sql
mysql> USE performance_schema;
ERROR 1820 (HY000): You must reset your password using ALTER USER
statement before executing this statement.

mysql> SELECT 1;
ERROR 1820 (HY000): You must reset your password using ALTER USER
statement before executing this statement.
```

That is what normally happens for interactive invocations of the
[**mysql**](mysql.md "6.5.1 mysql — The MySQL Command-Line Client") client because by default such
invocations are put in sandbox mode. To resume normal functioning,
select a new password.

For noninteractive invocations of the [**mysql**](mysql.md "6.5.1 mysql — The MySQL Command-Line Client")
client (for example, in batch mode), the server normally
disconnects the client if the password is expired. To permit
noninteractive [**mysql**](mysql.md "6.5.1 mysql — The MySQL Command-Line Client") invocations to stay
connected so that the password can be changed (using the
statements permitted in sandbox mode), add the
[`--connect-expired-password`](mysql-command-options.md#option_mysql_connect-expired-password) option to
the [**mysql**](mysql.md "6.5.1 mysql — The MySQL Command-Line Client") command.

As mentioned previously, whether the server disconnects an
expired-password client or restricts it to sandbox mode depends on
a combination of client and server settings. The following
discussion describes the relevant settings and how they interact.

Note

This discussion applies only for accounts with expired
passwords. If a client connects using a nonexpired password, the
server handles the client normally.

On the client side, a given client indicates whether it can handle
sandbox mode for expired passwords. For clients that use the C
client library, there are two ways to do this:

- Pass the
  `MYSQL_OPT_CAN_HANDLE_EXPIRED_PASSWORDS` flag
  to [`mysql_options()`](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/c-api/8.0/en/mysql-options.html) prior to
  connecting:

  ```c
  bool arg = 1;
  mysql_options(mysql,
                MYSQL_OPT_CAN_HANDLE_EXPIRED_PASSWORDS,
                &arg);
  ```

  This is the technique used within the [**mysql**](mysql.md "6.5.1 mysql — The MySQL Command-Line Client")
  client, which enables
  `MYSQL_OPT_CAN_HANDLE_EXPIRED_PASSWORDS` if
  invoked interactively or with the
  [`--connect-expired-password`](mysql-command-options.md#option_mysql_connect-expired-password)
  option.
- Pass the
  `CLIENT_CAN_HANDLE_EXPIRED_PASSWORDS` flag to
  [`mysql_real_connect()`](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/c-api/8.0/en/mysql-real-connect.html) at
  connect time:

  ```c
  MYSQL mysql;
  mysql_init(&mysql);
  if (!mysql_real_connect(&mysql,
                          host, user, password, db,
                          port, unix_socket,
                          CLIENT_CAN_HANDLE_EXPIRED_PASSWORDS))
  {
    ... handle error ...
  }
  ```

Other MySQL Connectors have their own conventions for indicating
readiness to handle sandbox mode. See the documentation for the
Connector in which you are interested.

On the server side, if a client indicates that it can handle
expired passwords, the server puts it in sandbox mode.

If a client does not indicate that it can handle expired passwords
(or uses an older version of the client library that cannot so
indicate), the server action depends on the value of the
[`disconnect_on_expired_password`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_disconnect_on_expired_password)
system variable:

- If
  [`disconnect_on_expired_password`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_disconnect_on_expired_password)
  is enabled (the default), the server disconnects the client
  with an
  [`ER_MUST_CHANGE_PASSWORD_LOGIN`](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/mysql-errors/8.0/en/server-error-reference.html#error_er_must_change_password_login)
  error.
- If
  [`disconnect_on_expired_password`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_disconnect_on_expired_password)
  is disabled, the server puts the client in sandbox mode.
