### 2.4.1 General Notes on Installing MySQL on macOS

You should keep the following issues and notes in mind:

- **Other MySQL installations**:
  The installation procedure does not recognize MySQL
  installations by package managers such as Homebrew. The
  installation and upgrade process is for MySQL packages
  provided by us. If other installations are present, then
  consider stopping them before executing this installer to
  avoid port conflicts.

  **Homebrew**: For example, if you
  installed MySQL Server using Homebrew to its default location
  then the MySQL installer installs to a different location and
  won't upgrade the version from Homebrew. In this scenario you
  would end up with multiple MySQL installations that, by
  default, attempt to use the same ports. Stop the other MySQL
  Server instances before running this installer, such as
  executing *brew services stop mysql* to
  stop the Homebrew's MySQL service.
- **Launchd**: A launchd daemon is
  installed that alters MySQL configuration options. Consider
  editing it if needed, see the documentation below for
  additional information. Also, macOS 10.10 removed startup item
  support in favor of launchd daemons. The optional MySQL
  preference pane under macOS System
  Preferences uses the launchd daemon.
- **Users**: You may need (or want)
  to create a specific `mysql` user to own the
  MySQL directory and data. You can do this through the
  **Directory Utility**, and the
  `mysql` user should already exist. For use in
  single user mode, an entry for `_mysql` (note
  the underscore prefix) should already exist within the system
  `/etc/passwd` file.
- **Data**: Because the MySQL
  package installer installs the MySQL contents into a version
  and platform specific directory, you can use this to upgrade
  and migrate your database between versions. You need either to
  copy the `data` directory from the old
  version to the new version, or to specify an alternative
  `datadir` value to set location of the data
  directory. By default, the MySQL directories are installed
  under `/usr/local/`.
- **Aliases**: You might want to
  add aliases to your shell's resource file to make it easier to
  access commonly used programs such as [**mysql**](mysql.md "6.5.1 mysql — The MySQL Command-Line Client")
  and [**mysqladmin**](mysqladmin.md "6.5.2 mysqladmin — A MySQL Server Administration Program") from the command line. The
  syntax for **bash** is:

  ```terminal
  alias mysql=/usr/local/mysql/bin/mysql
  alias mysqladmin=/usr/local/mysql/bin/mysqladmin
  ```

  For **tcsh**, use:

  ```terminal
  alias mysql /usr/local/mysql/bin/mysql
  alias mysqladmin /usr/local/mysql/bin/mysqladmin
  ```

  Even better, add `/usr/local/mysql/bin` to
  your `PATH` environment variable. You can do
  this by modifying the appropriate startup file for your shell.
  For more information, see [Section 6.2.1, “Invoking MySQL Programs”](invoking-programs.md "6.2.1 Invoking MySQL Programs").
- **Removing**: After you have
  copied over the MySQL database files from the previous
  installation and have successfully started the new server, you
  should consider removing the old installation files to save
  disk space. Additionally, you should also remove older
  versions of the Package Receipt directories located in
  `/Library/Receipts/mysql-VERSION.pkg`.
