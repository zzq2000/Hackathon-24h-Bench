#### 19.5.1.37 Replication and TRUNCATE TABLE

[`TRUNCATE TABLE`](truncate-table.md "15.1.37 TRUNCATE TABLE Statement") is normally
regarded as a DML statement, and so would be expected to be
logged and replicated using row-based format when the binary
logging mode is `ROW` or
`MIXED`. However this caused issues when
logging or replicating, in `STATEMENT` or
`MIXED` mode, tables that used transactional
storage engines such as [`InnoDB`](innodb-storage-engine.md "Chapter 17 The InnoDB Storage Engine") when
the transaction isolation level was `READ
COMMITTED` or `READ UNCOMMITTED`,
which precludes statement-based logging.

[`TRUNCATE TABLE`](truncate-table.md "15.1.37 TRUNCATE TABLE Statement") is treated for
purposes of logging and replication as DDL rather than DML so
that it can be logged and replicated as a statement. However,
the effects of the statement as applicable to
[`InnoDB`](innodb-storage-engine.md "Chapter 17 The InnoDB Storage Engine") and other transactional
tables on replicas still follow the rules described in
[Section 15.1.37, “TRUNCATE TABLE Statement”](truncate-table.md "15.1.37 TRUNCATE TABLE Statement") governing such tables. (Bug
#36763)
