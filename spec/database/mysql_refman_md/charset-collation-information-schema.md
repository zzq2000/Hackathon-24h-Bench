### 12.8.7 Using Collation in INFORMATION\_SCHEMA Searches

String columns in `INFORMATION_SCHEMA` tables
have a collation of `utf8mb3_general_ci`, which
is case-insensitive. However, for values that correspond to
objects that are represented in the file system, such as
databases and tables, searches in
`INFORMATION_SCHEMA` string columns can be
case-sensitive or case-insensitive, depending on the
characteristics of the underlying file system and the
[`lower_case_table_names`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_lower_case_table_names) system
variable setting. For example, searches may be case-sensitive if
the file system is case-sensitive. This section describes this
behavior and how to modify it if necessary.

Suppose that a query searches the
`SCHEMATA.SCHEMA_NAME` column for the
`test` database. On Linux, file systems are
case-sensitive, so comparisons of
`SCHEMATA.SCHEMA_NAME` with
`'test'` match, but comparisons with
`'TEST'` do not:

```sql
mysql> SELECT SCHEMA_NAME FROM INFORMATION_SCHEMA.SCHEMATA
       WHERE SCHEMA_NAME = 'test';
+-------------+
| SCHEMA_NAME |
+-------------+
| test        |
+-------------+

mysql> SELECT SCHEMA_NAME FROM INFORMATION_SCHEMA.SCHEMATA
       WHERE SCHEMA_NAME = 'TEST';
Empty set (0.00 sec)
```

These results occur with the
[`lower_case_table_names`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_lower_case_table_names) system
variable set to 0. A
[`lower_case_table_names`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_lower_case_table_names) setting
of 1 or 2 causes the second query to return the same (nonempty)
result as the first query.

Note

It is prohibited to start the server with a
[`lower_case_table_names`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_lower_case_table_names)
setting that is different from the setting used when the
server was initialized.

On Windows or macOS, file systems are not case-sensitive, so
comparisons match both `'test'` and
`'TEST'`:

```sql
mysql> SELECT SCHEMA_NAME FROM INFORMATION_SCHEMA.SCHEMATA
       WHERE SCHEMA_NAME = 'test';
+-------------+
| SCHEMA_NAME |
+-------------+
| test        |
+-------------+

mysql> SELECT SCHEMA_NAME FROM INFORMATION_SCHEMA.SCHEMATA
       WHERE SCHEMA_NAME = 'TEST';
+-------------+
| SCHEMA_NAME |
+-------------+
| TEST        |
+-------------+
```

The value of
[`lower_case_table_names`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_lower_case_table_names) makes no
difference in this context.

The preceding behavior occurs because the
`utf8mb3_general_ci` collation is not used for
`INFORMATION_SCHEMA` queries when searching for
values that correspond to objects represented in the file
system.

If the result of a string operation on an
`INFORMATION_SCHEMA` column differs from
expectations, a workaround is to use an explicit
`COLLATE` clause to force a suitable collation
(see [Section 12.8.1, “Using COLLATE in SQL Statements”](charset-collate.md "12.8.1 Using COLLATE in SQL Statements")). For example, to perform
a case-insensitive search, use `COLLATE` with
the `INFORMATION_SCHEMA` column name:

```sql
mysql> SELECT SCHEMA_NAME FROM INFORMATION_SCHEMA.SCHEMATA
       WHERE SCHEMA_NAME COLLATE utf8mb3_general_ci = 'test';
+-------------+
| SCHEMA_NAME |
+-------------+
| test        |
+-------------+

mysql> SELECT SCHEMA_NAME FROM INFORMATION_SCHEMA.SCHEMATA
       WHERE SCHEMA_NAME COLLATE utf8mb3_general_ci = 'TEST';
+-------------+
| SCHEMA_NAME |
+-------------+
| test        |
+-------------+
```

You can also use the [`UPPER()`](string-functions.md#function_upper) or
[`LOWER()`](string-functions.md#function_lower) function:

```sql
WHERE UPPER(SCHEMA_NAME) = 'TEST'
WHERE LOWER(SCHEMA_NAME) = 'test'
```

Although a case-insensitive comparison can be performed even on
platforms with case-sensitive file systems, as just shown, it is
not necessarily always the right thing to do. On such platforms,
it is possible to have multiple objects with names that differ
only in lettercase. For example, tables named
`city`, `CITY`, and
`City` can all exist simultaneously. Consider
whether a search should match all such names or just one and
write queries accordingly. The first of the following
comparisons (with `utf8mb3_bin`) is
case-sensitive; the others are not:

```sql
WHERE TABLE_NAME COLLATE utf8mb3_bin = 'City'
WHERE TABLE_NAME COLLATE utf8mb3_general_ci = 'city'
WHERE UPPER(TABLE_NAME) = 'CITY'
WHERE LOWER(TABLE_NAME) = 'city'
```

Searches in `INFORMATION_SCHEMA` string columns
for values that refer to `INFORMATION_SCHEMA`
itself do use the `utf8mb3_general_ci`
collation because `INFORMATION_SCHEMA` is a
“virtual” database not represented in the file
system. For example, comparisons with
`SCHEMATA.SCHEMA_NAME` match
`'information_schema'` or
`'INFORMATION_SCHEMA'` regardless of platform:

```sql
mysql> SELECT SCHEMA_NAME FROM INFORMATION_SCHEMA.SCHEMATA
       WHERE SCHEMA_NAME = 'information_schema';
+--------------------+
| SCHEMA_NAME        |
+--------------------+
| information_schema |
+--------------------+

mysql> SELECT SCHEMA_NAME FROM INFORMATION_SCHEMA.SCHEMATA
       WHERE SCHEMA_NAME = 'INFORMATION_SCHEMA';
+--------------------+
| SCHEMA_NAME        |
+--------------------+
| information_schema |
+--------------------+
```
