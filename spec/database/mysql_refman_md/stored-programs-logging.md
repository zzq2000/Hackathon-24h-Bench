## 27.7 Stored Program Binary Logging

The binary log contains information about SQL statements that
modify database contents. This information is stored in the form
of “events” that describe the modifications. (Binary
log events differ from scheduled event stored objects.) The binary
log has two important purposes:

- For replication, the binary log is used on source replication
  servers as a record of the statements to be sent to replica
  servers. The source sends the events contained in its binary
  log to its replicas, which execute those events to make the
  same data changes that were made on the source. See
  [Section 19.2, “Replication Implementation”](replication-implementation.md "19.2 Replication Implementation").
- Certain data recovery operations require use of the binary
  log. After a backup file has been restored, the events in the
  binary log that were recorded after the backup was made are
  re-executed. These events bring databases up to date from the
  point of the backup. See
  [Section 9.3.2, “Using Backups for Recovery”](recovery-from-backups.md "9.3.2 Using Backups for Recovery").

However, if logging occurs at the statement level, there are
certain binary logging issues with respect to stored programs
(stored procedures and functions, triggers, and events):

- In some cases, a statement might affect different sets of rows
  on source and replica.
- Replicated statements executed on a replica are processed by
  the replica's applier thread. Unless you implement replication
  privilege checks, which are available from MySQL 8.0.18 (see
  [Section 19.3.3, “Replication Privilege Checks”](replication-privilege-checks.md "19.3.3 Replication Privilege Checks")), the applier
  thread has full privileges. In this situation, it is possible
  for a procedure to follow different execution paths on source
  and replica servers, so a user could write a routine
  containing a dangerous statement that executes only on the
  replica.
- If a stored program that modifies data is nondeterministic, it
  is not repeatable. This can result in different data on source
  and replica, or cause restored data to differ from the
  original data.

This section describes how MySQL handles binary logging for stored
programs. It states the current conditions that the implementation
places on the use of stored programs, and what you can do to avoid
logging problems. It also provides additional information about
the reasons for these conditions.

Unless noted otherwise, the remarks here assume that binary
logging is enabled on the server (see
[Section 7.4.4, “The Binary Log”](binary-log.md "7.4.4 The Binary Log").) If the binary log is not enabled,
replication is not possible, nor is the binary log available for
data recovery. From MySQL 8.0, binary logging is enabled by
default, and is only disabled if you specify the
[`--skip-log-bin`](replication-options-binary-log.md#option_mysqld_log-bin)
or
[`--disable-log-bin`](replication-options-binary-log.md#option_mysqld_log-bin)
option at startup.

In general, the issues described here result when binary logging
occurs at the SQL statement level (statement-based binary
logging). If you use row-based binary logging, the log contains
changes made to individual rows as a result of executing SQL
statements. When routines or triggers execute, row changes are
logged, not the statements that make the changes. For stored
procedures, this means that the
[`CALL`](call.md "15.2.1 CALL Statement") statement is not logged. For
stored functions, row changes made within the function are logged,
not the function invocation. For triggers, row changes made by the
trigger are logged. On the replica side, only the row changes are
seen, not the stored program invocation.

Mixed format binary logging
([`binlog_format=MIXED`](replication-options-binary-log.md#sysvar_binlog_format)) uses
statement-based binary logging, except for cases where only
row-based binary logging is guaranteed to lead to proper results.
With mixed format, when a stored function, stored procedure,
trigger, event, or prepared statement contains anything that is
not safe for statement-based binary logging, the entire statement
is marked as unsafe and logged in row format. The statements used
to create and drop procedures, functions, triggers, and events are
always safe, and are logged in statement format. For more
information about row-based, mixed, and statement-based logging,
and how safe and unsafe statements are determined, see
[Section 19.2.1, “Replication Formats”](replication-formats.md "19.2.1 Replication Formats").

The conditions on the use of stored functions in MySQL can be
summarized as follows. These conditions do not apply to stored
procedures or Event Scheduler events and they do not apply unless
binary logging is enabled.

- To create or alter a stored function, you must have the
  [`SET_USER_ID`](privileges-provided.md#priv_set-user-id) privilege (or the
  deprecated [`SUPER`](privileges-provided.md#priv_super) privilege), in
  addition to the [`CREATE ROUTINE`](privileges-provided.md#priv_create-routine)
  or [`ALTER ROUTINE`](privileges-provided.md#priv_alter-routine) privilege that
  is normally required. (Depending on the
  `DEFINER` value in the function definition,
  [`SET_USER_ID`](privileges-provided.md#priv_set-user-id) or
  [`SUPER`](privileges-provided.md#priv_super) might be required
  regardless of whether binary logging is enabled. See
  [Section 15.1.17, “CREATE PROCEDURE and CREATE FUNCTION Statements”](create-procedure.md "15.1.17 CREATE PROCEDURE and CREATE FUNCTION Statements").)
- When you create a stored function, you must declare either
  that it is deterministic or that it does not modify data.
  Otherwise, it may be unsafe for data recovery or replication.

  By default, for a [`CREATE
  FUNCTION`](create-function.md "15.1.14 CREATE FUNCTION Statement") statement to be accepted, at least one of
  `DETERMINISTIC`, `NO SQL`,
  or `READS SQL DATA` must be specified
  explicitly. Otherwise an error occurs:

  ```none
  ERROR 1418 (HY000): This function has none of DETERMINISTIC, NO SQL,
  or READS SQL DATA in its declaration and binary logging is enabled
  (you *might* want to use the less safe log_bin_trust_function_creators
  variable)
  ```

  This function is deterministic (and does not modify data), so
  it is safe:

  ```sql
  CREATE FUNCTION f1(i INT)
  RETURNS INT
  DETERMINISTIC
  READS SQL DATA
  BEGIN
    RETURN i;
  END;
  ```

  This function uses [`UUID()`](miscellaneous-functions.md#function_uuid),
  which is not deterministic, so the function also is not
  deterministic and is not safe:

  ```sql
  CREATE FUNCTION f2()
  RETURNS CHAR(36) CHARACTER SET utf8mb4
  BEGIN
    RETURN UUID();
  END;
  ```

  This function modifies data, so it may not be safe:

  ```sql
  CREATE FUNCTION f3(p_id INT)
  RETURNS INT
  BEGIN
    UPDATE t SET modtime = NOW() WHERE id = p_id;
    RETURN ROW_COUNT();
  END;
  ```

  Assessment of the nature of a function is based on the
  “honesty” of the creator. MySQL does not check
  that a function declared `DETERMINISTIC` is
  free of statements that produce nondeterministic results.
- When you attempt to execute a stored function, if
  [`binlog_format=STATEMENT`](replication-options-binary-log.md#sysvar_binlog_format) is
  set, the `DETERMINISTIC` keyword must be
  specified in the function definition. If this is not the case,
  an error is generated and the function does not run, unless
  [`log_bin_trust_function_creators=1`](replication-options-binary-log.md#sysvar_log_bin_trust_function_creators)
  is specified to override this check (see below). For recursive
  function calls, the `DETERMINISTIC` keyword
  is required on the outermost call only. If row-based or mixed
  binary logging is in use, the statement is accepted and
  replicated even if the function was defined without the
  `DETERMINISTIC` keyword.
- Because MySQL does not check if a function really is
  deterministic at creation time, the invocation of a stored
  function with the `DETERMINISTIC` keyword
  might carry out an action that is unsafe for statement-based
  logging, or invoke a function or procedure containing unsafe
  statements. If this occurs when
  [`binlog_format=STATEMENT`](replication-options-binary-log.md#sysvar_binlog_format) is
  set, a warning message is issued. If row-based or mixed binary
  logging is in use, no warning is issued, and the statement is
  replicated in row-based format.
- To relax the preceding conditions on function creation (that
  you must have the [`SUPER`](privileges-provided.md#priv_super)
  privilege and that a function must be declared deterministic
  or to not modify data), set the global
  [`log_bin_trust_function_creators`](replication-options-binary-log.md#sysvar_log_bin_trust_function_creators)
  system variable to 1. By default, this variable has a value of
  0, but you can change it like this:

  ```sql
  mysql> SET GLOBAL log_bin_trust_function_creators = 1;
  ```

  You can also set this variable at server startup.

  If binary logging is not enabled,
  [`log_bin_trust_function_creators`](replication-options-binary-log.md#sysvar_log_bin_trust_function_creators)
  does not apply. [`SUPER`](privileges-provided.md#priv_super) is not
  required for function creation unless, as described
  previously, the `DEFINER` value in the
  function definition requires it.
- For information about built-in functions that may be unsafe
  for replication (and thus cause stored functions that use them
  to be unsafe as well), see
  [Section 19.5.1, “Replication Features and Issues”](replication-features.md "19.5.1 Replication Features and Issues").

Triggers are similar to stored functions, so the preceding remarks
regarding functions also apply to triggers with the following
exception: [`CREATE TRIGGER`](create-trigger.md "15.1.22 CREATE TRIGGER Statement") does not
have an optional `DETERMINISTIC` characteristic,
so triggers are assumed to be always deterministic. However, this
assumption might be invalid in some cases. For example, the
[`UUID()`](miscellaneous-functions.md#function_uuid) function is nondeterministic
(and does not replicate). Be careful about using such functions in
triggers.

Triggers can update tables, so error messages similar to those for
stored functions occur with [`CREATE
TRIGGER`](create-trigger.md "15.1.22 CREATE TRIGGER Statement") if you do not have the required privileges. On
the replica side, the replica uses the trigger
`DEFINER` attribute to determine which user is
considered to be the creator of the trigger.

The rest of this section provides additional detail about the
logging implementation and its implications. You need not read it
unless you are interested in the background on the rationale for
the current logging-related conditions on stored routine use. This
discussion applies only for statement-based logging, and not for
row-based logging, with the exception of the first item:
`CREATE` and `DROP` statements
are logged as statements regardless of the logging mode.

- The server writes [`CREATE EVENT`](create-event.md "15.1.13 CREATE EVENT Statement"),
  [`CREATE PROCEDURE`](create-procedure.md "15.1.17 CREATE PROCEDURE and CREATE FUNCTION Statements"),
  [`CREATE FUNCTION`](create-function.md "15.1.14 CREATE FUNCTION Statement"),
  [`ALTER EVENT`](alter-event.md "15.1.3 ALTER EVENT Statement"),
  [`ALTER PROCEDURE`](alter-procedure.md "15.1.7 ALTER PROCEDURE Statement"),
  [`ALTER FUNCTION`](alter-function.md "15.1.4 ALTER FUNCTION Statement"),
  [`DROP EVENT`](drop-event.md "15.1.25 DROP EVENT Statement"),
  [`DROP PROCEDURE`](drop-procedure.md "15.1.29 DROP PROCEDURE and DROP FUNCTION Statements"), and
  [`DROP FUNCTION`](drop-function.md "15.1.26 DROP FUNCTION Statement") statements to the
  binary log.
- A stored function invocation is logged as a
  [`SELECT`](select.md "15.2.13 SELECT Statement") statement if the
  function changes data and occurs within a statement that would
  not otherwise be logged. This prevents nonreplication of data
  changes that result from use of stored functions in nonlogged
  statements. For example, [`SELECT`](select.md "15.2.13 SELECT Statement")
  statements are not written to the binary log, but a
  [`SELECT`](select.md "15.2.13 SELECT Statement") might invoke a stored
  function that makes changes. To handle this, a `SELECT
  func_name()` statement is
  written to the binary log when the given function makes a
  change. Suppose that the following statements are executed on
  the source server:

  ```sql
  CREATE FUNCTION f1(a INT) RETURNS INT
  BEGIN
    IF (a < 3) THEN
      INSERT INTO t2 VALUES (a);
    END IF;
    RETURN 0;
  END;

  CREATE TABLE t1 (a INT);
  INSERT INTO t1 VALUES (1),(2),(3);

  SELECT f1(a) FROM t1;
  ```

  When the [`SELECT`](select.md "15.2.13 SELECT Statement") statement
  executes, the function `f1()` is invoked
  three times. Two of those invocations insert a row, and MySQL
  logs a [`SELECT`](select.md "15.2.13 SELECT Statement") statement for
  each of them. That is, MySQL writes the following statements
  to the binary log:

  ```sql
  SELECT f1(1);
  SELECT f1(2);
  ```

  The server also logs a [`SELECT`](select.md "15.2.13 SELECT Statement")
  statement for a stored function invocation when the function
  invokes a stored procedure that causes an error. In this case,
  the server writes the [`SELECT`](select.md "15.2.13 SELECT Statement")
  statement to the log along with the expected error code. On
  the replica, if the same error occurs, that is the expected
  result and replication continues. Otherwise, replication
  stops.
- Logging stored function invocations rather than the statements
  executed by a function has a security implication for
  replication, which arises from two factors:

  - It is possible for a function to follow different
    execution paths on source and replica servers.
  - Statements executed on a replica are processed by the
    replica's applier thread. Unless you implement replication
    privilege checks, which are available from MySQL 8.0.18
    (see [Section 19.3.3, “Replication Privilege Checks”](replication-privilege-checks.md "19.3.3 Replication Privilege Checks")), the
    applier thread has full privileges.

  The implication is that although a user must have the
  [`CREATE ROUTINE`](privileges-provided.md#priv_create-routine) privilege to
  create a function, the user can write a function containing a
  dangerous statement that executes only on the replica where it
  is processed by a thread that has full privileges. For
  example, if the source and replica servers have server ID
  values of 1 and 2, respectively, a user on the source server
  could create and invoke an unsafe function
  `unsafe_func()` as follows:

  ```sql
  mysql> delimiter //
  mysql> CREATE FUNCTION unsafe_func () RETURNS INT
      -> BEGIN
      ->   IF @@server_id=2 THEN dangerous_statement; END IF;
      ->   RETURN 1;
      -> END;
      -> //
  mysql> delimiter ;
  mysql> INSERT INTO t VALUES(unsafe_func());
  ```

  The [`CREATE FUNCTION`](create-function.md "15.1.14 CREATE FUNCTION Statement") and
  [`INSERT`](insert.md "15.2.7 INSERT Statement") statements are written
  to the binary log, so the replica executes them. Because the
  replica's applier thread has full privileges, it executes the
  dangerous statement. Thus, the function invocation has
  different effects on the source and replica and is not
  replication-safe.

  To guard against this danger for servers that have binary
  logging enabled, stored function creators must have the
  [`SUPER`](privileges-provided.md#priv_super) privilege, in addition to
  the usual [`CREATE ROUTINE`](privileges-provided.md#priv_create-routine)
  privilege that is required. Similarly, to use
  [`ALTER FUNCTION`](alter-function.md "15.1.4 ALTER FUNCTION Statement"), you must have
  the [`SUPER`](privileges-provided.md#priv_super) privilege in addition
  to the [`ALTER ROUTINE`](privileges-provided.md#priv_alter-routine) privilege.
  Without the [`SUPER`](privileges-provided.md#priv_super) privilege, an
  error occurs:

  ```none
  ERROR 1419 (HY000): You do not have the SUPER privilege and
  binary logging is enabled (you *might* want to use the less safe
  log_bin_trust_function_creators variable)
  ```

  If you do not want to require function creators to have the
  [`SUPER`](privileges-provided.md#priv_super) privilege (for example,
  if all users with the [`CREATE
  ROUTINE`](privileges-provided.md#priv_create-routine) privilege on your system are experienced
  application developers), set the global
  [`log_bin_trust_function_creators`](replication-options-binary-log.md#sysvar_log_bin_trust_function_creators)
  system variable to 1. You can also set this variable at server
  startup. If binary logging is not enabled,
  [`log_bin_trust_function_creators`](replication-options-binary-log.md#sysvar_log_bin_trust_function_creators)
  does not apply. [`SUPER`](privileges-provided.md#priv_super) is not
  required for function creation unless, as described
  previously, the `DEFINER` value in the
  function definition requires it.
- The use of replication privilege checks where available (from
  MySQL 8.0.18) is recommended whatever choice you make about
  privileges for function creators. Replication privilege checks
  can be set up to ensure that only expected and relevant
  operations are authorized for the replication channel. For
  instructions to do this, see
  [Section 19.3.3, “Replication Privilege Checks”](replication-privilege-checks.md "19.3.3 Replication Privilege Checks").
- If a function that performs updates is nondeterministic, it is
  not repeatable. This can have two undesirable effects:

  - It causes a replica to differ from the source.
  - Restored data does not match the original data.

  To deal with these problems, MySQL enforces the following
  requirement: On a source server, creation and alteration of a
  function is refused unless you declare the function to be
  deterministic or to not modify data. Two sets of function
  characteristics apply here:

  - The `DETERMINISTIC` and `NOT
    DETERMINISTIC` characteristics indicate whether a
    function always produces the same result for given inputs.
    The default is `NOT DETERMINISTIC` if
    neither characteristic is given. To declare that a
    function is deterministic, you must specify
    `DETERMINISTIC` explicitly.
  - The `CONTAINS SQL`, `NO
    SQL`, `READS SQL DATA`, and
    `MODIFIES SQL DATA` characteristics
    provide information about whether the function reads or
    writes data. Either `NO SQL` or
    `READS SQL DATA` indicates that a
    function does not change data, but you must specify one of
    these explicitly because the default is `CONTAINS
    SQL` if no characteristic is given.

  By default, for a [`CREATE
  FUNCTION`](create-function.md "15.1.14 CREATE FUNCTION Statement") statement to be accepted, at least one of
  `DETERMINISTIC`, `NO SQL`,
  or `READS SQL DATA` must be specified
  explicitly. Otherwise an error occurs:

  ```none
  ERROR 1418 (HY000): This function has none of DETERMINISTIC, NO SQL,
  or READS SQL DATA in its declaration and binary logging is enabled
  (you *might* want to use the less safe log_bin_trust_function_creators
  variable)
  ```

  If you set
  [`log_bin_trust_function_creators`](replication-options-binary-log.md#sysvar_log_bin_trust_function_creators)
  to 1, the requirement that functions be deterministic or not
  modify data is dropped.
- Stored procedure calls are logged at the statement level
  rather than at the [`CALL`](call.md "15.2.1 CALL Statement") level.
  That is, the server does not log the
  [`CALL`](call.md "15.2.1 CALL Statement") statement, it logs those
  statements within the procedure that actually execute. As a
  result, the same changes that occur on the source server also
  occur on replicas. This prevents problems that could result
  from a procedure having different execution paths on different
  machines.

  In general, statements executed within a stored procedure are
  written to the binary log using the same rules that would
  apply were the statements to be executed in standalone
  fashion. Some special care is taken when logging procedure
  statements because statement execution within procedures is
  not quite the same as in nonprocedure context:

  - A statement to be logged might contain references to local
    procedure variables. These variables do not exist outside
    of stored procedure context, so a statement that refers to
    such a variable cannot be logged literally. Instead, each
    reference to a local variable is replaced by this
    construct for logging purposes:

    ```sql
    NAME_CONST(var_name, var_value)
    ```

    *`var_name`* is the local variable
    name, and *`var_value`* is a
    constant indicating the value that the variable has at the
    time the statement is logged.
    [`NAME_CONST()`](miscellaneous-functions.md#function_name-const) has a value of
    *`var_value`*, and a
    “name” of
    *`var_name`*. Thus, if you invoke
    this function directly, you get a result like this:

    ```sql
    mysql> SELECT NAME_CONST('myname', 14);
    +--------+
    | myname |
    +--------+
    |     14 |
    +--------+
    ```

    [`NAME_CONST()`](miscellaneous-functions.md#function_name-const) enables a
    logged standalone statement to be executed on a replica
    with the same effect as the original statement that was
    executed on the source within a stored procedure.

    The use of [`NAME_CONST()`](miscellaneous-functions.md#function_name-const) can
    result in a problem for
    [`CREATE TABLE
    ... SELECT`](create-table.md "15.1.20 CREATE TABLE Statement") statements when the source column
    expressions refer to local variables. Converting these
    references to [`NAME_CONST()`](miscellaneous-functions.md#function_name-const)
    expressions can result in column names that are different
    on the source and replica servers, or names that are too
    long to be legal column identifiers. A workaround is to
    supply aliases for columns that refer to local variables.
    Consider this statement when `myvar` has
    a value of 1:

    ```sql
    CREATE TABLE t1 SELECT myvar;
    ```

    This is rewritten as follows:

    ```sql
    CREATE TABLE t1 SELECT NAME_CONST(myvar, 1);
    ```

    To ensure that the source and replica tables have the same
    column names, write the statement like this:

    ```sql
    CREATE TABLE t1 SELECT myvar AS myvar;
    ```

    The rewritten statement becomes:

    ```sql
    CREATE TABLE t1 SELECT NAME_CONST(myvar, 1) AS myvar;
    ```
  - A statement to be logged might contain references to
    user-defined variables. To handle this, MySQL writes a
    [`SET`](set-variable.md "15.7.6.1 SET Syntax for Variable Assignment")
    statement to the binary log to make sure that the variable
    exists on the replica with the same value as on the
    source. For example, if a statement refers to a variable
    `@my_var`, that statement is preceded in
    the binary log by the following statement, where
    *`value`* is the value of
    `@my_var` on the source:

    ```sql
    SET @my_var = value;
    ```
  - Procedure calls can occur within a committed or
    rolled-back transaction. Transactional context is
    accounted for so that the transactional aspects of
    procedure execution are replicated correctly. That is, the
    server logs those statements within the procedure that
    actually execute and modify data, and also logs
    [`BEGIN`](commit.md "15.3.1 START TRANSACTION, COMMIT, and ROLLBACK Statements"),
    [`COMMIT`](commit.md "15.3.1 START TRANSACTION, COMMIT, and ROLLBACK Statements"), and
    [`ROLLBACK`](commit.md "15.3.1 START TRANSACTION, COMMIT, and ROLLBACK Statements")
    statements as necessary. For example, if a procedure
    updates only transactional tables and is executed within a
    transaction that is rolled back, those updates are not
    logged. If the procedure occurs within a committed
    transaction,
    [`BEGIN`](commit.md "15.3.1 START TRANSACTION, COMMIT, and ROLLBACK Statements")
    and [`COMMIT`](commit.md "15.3.1 START TRANSACTION, COMMIT, and ROLLBACK Statements") statements are
    logged with the updates. For a procedure that executes
    within a rolled-back transaction, its statements are
    logged using the same rules that would apply if the
    statements were executed in standalone fashion:

    - Updates to transactional tables are not logged.
    - Updates to nontransactional tables are logged because
      rollback does not cancel them.
    - Updates to a mix of transactional and nontransactional
      tables are logged surrounded by
      [`BEGIN`](commit.md "15.3.1 START TRANSACTION, COMMIT, and ROLLBACK Statements")
      and
      [`ROLLBACK`](commit.md "15.3.1 START TRANSACTION, COMMIT, and ROLLBACK Statements")
      so that replicas make the same changes and rollbacks
      as on the source.
- A stored procedure call is *not* written to
  the binary log at the statement level if the procedure is
  invoked from within a stored function. In that case, the only
  thing logged is the statement that invokes the function (if it
  occurs within a statement that is logged) or a
  [`DO`](do.md "15.2.3 DO Statement") statement (if it occurs
  within a statement that is not logged). For this reason, care
  should be exercised in the use of stored functions that invoke
  a procedure, even if the procedure is otherwise safe in
  itself.
