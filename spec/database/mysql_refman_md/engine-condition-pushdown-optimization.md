#### 10.2.1.5 Engine Condition Pushdown Optimization

This optimization improves the efficiency of direct
comparisons between a nonindexed column and a constant. In
such cases, the condition is “pushed down” to the
storage engine for evaluation. This optimization can be used
only by the [`NDB`](mysql-cluster.md "Chapter 25 MySQL NDB Cluster 8.0") storage engine.

For NDB Cluster, this optimization can eliminate the need to
send nonmatching rows over the network between the
cluster's data nodes and the MySQL server that issued the
query, and can speed up queries where it is used by a factor
of 5 to 10 times over cases where condition pushdown could be
but is not used.

Suppose that an NDB Cluster table is defined as follows:

```sql
CREATE TABLE t1 (
    a INT,
    b INT,
    KEY(a)
) ENGINE=NDB;
```

Engine condition pushdown can be used with queries such as the
one shown here, which includes a comparison between a
nonindexed column and a constant:

```sql
SELECT a, b FROM t1 WHERE b = 10;
```

The use of engine condition pushdown can be seen in the output
of [`EXPLAIN`](explain.md "15.8.2 EXPLAIN Statement"):

```sql
mysql> EXPLAIN SELECT a, b FROM t1 WHERE b = 10\G
*************************** 1. row ***************************
           id: 1
  select_type: SIMPLE
        table: t1
         type: ALL
possible_keys: NULL
          key: NULL
      key_len: NULL
          ref: NULL
         rows: 10
        Extra: Using where with pushed condition
```

However, engine condition pushdown *cannot*
be used with the following query:

```sql
SELECT a,b FROM t1 WHERE a = 10;
```

Engine condition pushdown is not applicable here because an
index exists on column `a`. (An index access
method would be more efficient and so would be chosen in
preference to condition pushdown.)

Engine condition pushdown may also be employed when an indexed
column is compared with a constant using a
`>` or `<` operator:

```sql
mysql> EXPLAIN SELECT a, b FROM t1 WHERE a < 2\G
*************************** 1. row ***************************
           id: 1
  select_type: SIMPLE
        table: t1
         type: range
possible_keys: a
          key: a
      key_len: 5
          ref: NULL
         rows: 2
        Extra: Using where with pushed condition
```

Other supported comparisons for engine condition pushdown
include the following:

- `column [NOT] LIKE
  pattern`

  *`pattern`* must be a string
  literal containing the pattern to be matched; for syntax,
  see [Section 14.8.1, “String Comparison Functions and Operators”](string-comparison-functions.md "14.8.1 String Comparison Functions and Operators").
- `column IS [NOT]
  NULL`
- `column IN
  (value_list)`

  Each item in the *`value_list`*
  must be a constant, literal value.
- `column BETWEEN
  constant1 AND
  constant2`

  *`constant1`* and
  *`constant2`* must each be a
  constant, literal value.

In all of the cases in the preceding list, it is possible for
the condition to be converted into the form of one or more
direct comparisons between a column and a constant.

Engine condition pushdown is enabled by default. To disable it
at server startup, set the
[`optimizer_switch`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_optimizer_switch) system
variable's
[`engine_condition_pushdown`](switchable-optimizations.md#optflag_engine-condition-pushdown)
flag to `off`. For example, in a
`my.cnf` file, use these lines:

```ini
[mysqld]
optimizer_switch=engine_condition_pushdown=off
```

At runtime, disable condition pushdown like this:

```sql
SET optimizer_switch='engine_condition_pushdown=off';
```

**Limitations.**
Engine condition pushdown is subject to the following
limitations:

- Engine condition pushdown is supported only by the
  [`NDB`](mysql-cluster.md "Chapter 25 MySQL NDB Cluster 8.0") storage engine.
- Prior to NDB 8.0.18, columns could be compared with
  constants or expressions which evaluate to constant values
  only. In NDB 8.0.18 and later, columns can be compared
  with one another as long as they are of exactly the same
  type, including the same signedness, length, character
  set, precision, and scale, where these are applicable.
- Columns used in comparisons cannot be of any of the
  [`BLOB`](blob.md "13.3.4 The BLOB and TEXT Types") or
  [`TEXT`](blob.md "13.3.4 The BLOB and TEXT Types") types. This exclusion
  extends to [`JSON`](json.md "13.5 The JSON Data Type"),
  [`BIT`](bit-type.md "13.1.5 Bit-Value Type - BIT"), and
  [`ENUM`](enum.md "13.3.5 The ENUM Type") columns as well.
- A string value to be compared with a column must use the
  same collation as the column.
- Joins are not directly supported; conditions involving
  multiple tables are pushed separately where possible. Use
  extended [`EXPLAIN`](explain.md "15.8.2 EXPLAIN Statement") output to
  determine which conditions are actually pushed down. See
  [Section 10.8.3, “Extended EXPLAIN Output Format”](explain-extended.md "10.8.3 Extended EXPLAIN Output Format").

Previously, engine condition pushdown was limited to terms
referring to column values from the same table to which the
condition was being pushed. Beginning with NDB 8.0.16, column
values from tables earlier in the query plan can also be
referred to from pushed conditions. This reduces the number of
rows which must be handled by the SQL node during join
processing. Filtering can be also performed in parallel in the
LDM threads, rather than in a single [**mysqld**](mysqld.md "6.3.1 mysqld — The MySQL Server")
process. This has the potential to improve performance of
queries by a significant margin.

Beginning with NDB 8.0.20, an outer join using a scan can be
pushed if there are no unpushable conditions on any table used
in the same join nest, or on any table in join nests above it
on which it depends. This is also true for a semijoin,
provided the optimization strategy employed is
`firstMatch` (see
[Section 10.2.2.1, “Optimizing IN and EXISTS Subquery Predicates with Semijoin
Transformations”](semijoins.md "10.2.2.1 Optimizing IN and EXISTS Subquery Predicates with Semijoin Transformations")).

Join algorithms cannot be combined with referring columns from
previous tables in the following two situations:

1. When any of the referred previous tables are in a join
   buffer. In this case, each row retrieved from the
   scan-filtered table is matched against every row in the
   buffer. This means that there is no single specific row
   from which column values can be fetched from when
   generating the scan filter.
2. When the column originates from a child operation in a
   pushed join. This is because rows referenced from ancestor
   operations in the join have not yet been retrieved when
   the scan filter is generated.

Beginning with NDB 8.0.27, columns from ancestor tables in a
join can be pushed down, provided that they meet the
requirements listed previously. An example of such a query,
using the table `t1` created previously, is
shown here:

```sql
mysql> EXPLAIN
    ->   SELECT * FROM t1 AS x
    ->   LEFT JOIN t1 AS y
    ->   ON x.a=0 AND y.b>=3\G
*************************** 1. row ***************************
           id: 1
  select_type: SIMPLE
        table: x
   partitions: p0,p1
         type: ALL
possible_keys: NULL
          key: NULL
      key_len: NULL
          ref: NULL
         rows: 4
     filtered: 100.00
        Extra: NULL
*************************** 2. row ***************************
           id: 1
  select_type: SIMPLE
        table: y
   partitions: p0,p1
         type: ALL
possible_keys: NULL
          key: NULL
      key_len: NULL
          ref: NULL
         rows: 4
     filtered: 100.00
        Extra: Using where; Using pushed condition (`test`.`y`.`b` >= 3); Using join buffer (hash join)
2 rows in set, 2 warnings (0.00 sec)
```
