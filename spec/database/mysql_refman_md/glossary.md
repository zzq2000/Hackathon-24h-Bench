# MySQL Glossary

These terms are commonly used in information about the MySQL
database server.

### A

.ARM file
:   Metadata for `ARCHIVE` tables. Contrast with
    **.ARZ file**. Files with this
    extension are always included in backups produced by the
    `mysqlbackup` command of the
    **MySQL Enterprise Backup** product.

    See Also [.ARZ file](glossary.md#glos_arz_file), [MySQL Enterprise Backup](glossary.md#glos_mysql_enterprise_backup), [mysqlbackup command](glossary.md#glos_mysqlbackup_command).

.ARZ file
:   Data for ARCHIVE tables. Contrast with
    **.ARM file**. Files with this
    extension are always included in backups produced by the
    `mysqlbackup` command of the
    **MySQL Enterprise Backup** product.

    See Also [.ARM file](glossary.md#glos_arm_file), [MySQL Enterprise Backup](glossary.md#glos_mysql_enterprise_backup), [mysqlbackup command](glossary.md#glos_mysqlbackup_command).

ACID
:   An acronym standing for atomicity, consistency, isolation, and
    durability. These properties are all desirable in a database
    system, and are all closely tied to the notion of a
    **transaction**. The transactional
    features of `InnoDB` adhere to the ACID
    principles.

    Transactions are **atomic** units
    of work that can be **committed**
    or **rolled back**. When a
    transaction makes multiple changes to the database, either all
    the changes succeed when the transaction is committed, or all
    the changes are undone when the transaction is rolled back.

    The database remains in a consistent state at all times —
    after each commit or rollback, and while transactions are in
    progress. If related data is being updated across multiple
    tables, queries see either all old values or all new values, not
    a mix of old and new values.

    Transactions are protected (isolated) from each other while they
    are in progress; they cannot interfere with each other or see
    each other's uncommitted data. This isolation is achieved
    through the **locking** mechanism.
    Experienced users can adjust the **isolation
    level**, trading off less protection in favor of
    increased performance and
    **concurrency**, when they can be
    sure that the transactions really do not interfere with each
    other.

    The results of transactions are durable: once a commit operation
    succeeds, the changes made by that transaction are safe from
    power failures, system crashes, race conditions, or other
    potential dangers that many non-database applications are
    vulnerable to. Durability typically involves writing to disk
    storage, with a certain amount of redundancy to protect against
    power failures or software crashes during write operations. (In
    `InnoDB`, the **doublewrite
    buffer** assists with durability.)

    See Also [atomic](glossary.md#glos_atomic), [commit](glossary.md#glos_commit), [concurrency](glossary.md#glos_concurrency), [doublewrite buffer](glossary.md#glos_doublewrite_buffer), [isolation level](glossary.md#glos_isolation_level), [locking](glossary.md#glos_locking), [rollback](glossary.md#glos_rollback), [transaction](glossary.md#glos_transaction).

adaptive flushing
:   An algorithm for **InnoDB** tables
    that smooths out the I/O overhead introduced by
    **checkpoints**. Instead of
    **flushing** all modified
    **pages** from the
    **buffer pool** to the
    **data files** at once, MySQL
    periodically flushes small sets of modified pages. The adaptive
    flushing algorithm extends this process by estimating the
    optimal rate to perform these periodic flushes, based on the
    rate of flushing and how fast
    **redo** information is generated.

    See Also [buffer pool](glossary.md#glos_buffer_pool), [checkpoint](glossary.md#glos_checkpoint), [data files](glossary.md#glos_data_files), [flush](glossary.md#glos_flush), [InnoDB](glossary.md#glos_innodb), [page](glossary.md#glos_page), [redo log](glossary.md#glos_redo_log).

adaptive hash index
:   An optimization for `InnoDB` tables that can
    speed up lookups using `=` and
    `IN` operators, by constructing a
    **hash index** in memory. MySQL
    monitors index searches for `InnoDB` tables,
    and if queries could benefit from a hash index, it builds one
    automatically for index **pages**
    that are frequently accessed. In a sense, the adaptive hash
    index configures MySQL at runtime to take advantage of ample
    main memory, coming closer to the architecture of main-memory
    databases. This feature is controlled by the
    [`innodb_adaptive_hash_index`](innodb-parameters.md#sysvar_innodb_adaptive_hash_index)
    configuration option. Because this feature benefits some
    workloads and not others, and the memory used for the hash index
    is reserved in the **buffer pool**,
    typically you should benchmark with this feature both enabled
    and disabled.

    The hash index is always built based on an existing
    **B-tree** index on the table.
    MySQL can build a hash index on a prefix of any length of the
    key defined for the B-tree, depending on the pattern of searches
    against the index. A hash index can be partial; the whole B-tree
    index does not need to be cached in the buffer pool.

    See Also [B-tree](glossary.md#glos_b_tree), [buffer pool](glossary.md#glos_buffer_pool), [hash index](glossary.md#glos_hash_index), [page](glossary.md#glos_page), [secondary index](glossary.md#glos_secondary_index).

ADO.NET
:   An object-relational mapping (ORM) framework for applications
    built using .NET technologies such as
    **ASP.NET**. Such applications can
    interface with MySQL through the
    **Connector/NET** component.

    See Also [.NET](glossary.md#glos__net), [ASP.net](glossary.md#glos_asp_net), [Connector/NET](glossary.md#glos_connector_net), [Mono](glossary.md#glos_mono), [Visual Studio](glossary.md#glos_visual_studio).

AIO
:   Acronym for **asynchronous I/O**.
    You might see this acronym in `InnoDB` messages
    or keywords.

    See Also [asynchronous I/O](glossary.md#glos_asynchronous_io).

ANSI
:   In **ODBC**, an alternative method
    of supporting character sets and other internationalization
    aspects. Contrast with **Unicode**.
    **Connector/ODBC** 3.51 is an ANSI
    driver, while Connector/ODBC 5.1 is a Unicode driver.

    See Also [Connector/ODBC](glossary.md#glos_connector_odbc), [ODBC](glossary.md#glos_odbc), [Unicode](glossary.md#glos_unicode).

API
:   APIs provide low-level access to the MySQL protocol and MySQL
    resources from **client** programs.
    Contrast with the higher-level access provided by a
    **Connector**.

    See Also [C API](glossary.md#glos_c_api), [client](glossary.md#glos_client), [connector](glossary.md#glos_connector), [native C API](glossary.md#glos_native_c_api), [Perl API](glossary.md#glos_perl_api), [PHP API](glossary.md#glos_php_api), [Python API](glossary.md#glos_python_api), [Ruby API](glossary.md#glos_ruby_api).

application programming interface (API)
:   A set of functions or procedures. An API provides a stable set
    of names and types for functions, procedures, parameters, and
    return values.

apply
:   When a backup produced by the
    **MySQL Enterprise Backup** product does not include
    the most recent changes that occurred while the backup was
    underway, the process of updating the backup files to include
    those changes is known as the
    **apply** step. It is specified by
    the `apply-log` option of the
    `mysqlbackup` command.

    Before the changes are applied, we refer to the files as a
    **raw backup**. After the changes
    are applied, we refer to the files as a
    **prepared backup**. The changes
    are recorded in the
    **ibbackup\_logfile** file; once the
    apply step is finished, this file is no longer necessary.

    See Also [hot backup](glossary.md#glos_hot_backup), [ibbackup\_logfile](glossary.md#glos_ibbackup_logfile), [MySQL Enterprise Backup](glossary.md#glos_mysql_enterprise_backup), [prepared backup](glossary.md#glos_prepared_backup), [raw backup](glossary.md#glos_raw_backup).

AS
:   A Kerberos authentication server. AS can also refer to the
    authentication service provided by an authentication server.

    See Also [authentication server](glossary.md#glos_authentication_server).

ASP.net
:   A framework for developing web-based applications using
    **.NET** technologies and
    languages. Such applications can interface with MySQL through
    the **Connector/NET** component.

    Another technology for writing server-side web pages with MySQL
    is **PHP**.

    See Also [.NET](glossary.md#glos__net), [ADO.NET](glossary.md#glos_ado_net), [Connector/NET](glossary.md#glos_connector_net), [Mono](glossary.md#glos_mono), [PHP](glossary.md#glos_php), [Visual Studio](glossary.md#glos_visual_studio).

assembly
:   A library of compiled code in a
    **.NET** system, accessed through
    **Connector/NET**. Stored in the
    **GAC** to allow versioning without
    naming conflicts.

    See Also [.NET](glossary.md#glos__net), [GAC](glossary.md#glos_gac).

asynchronous I/O
:   A type of I/O operation that allows other processing to proceed
    before the I/O is completed. Also known as
    **nonblocking I/O** and abbreviated
    as **AIO**.
    `InnoDB` uses this type of I/O for certain
    operations that can run in parallel without affecting the
    reliability of the database, such as reading pages into the
    **buffer pool** that have not
    actually been requested, but might be needed soon.

    Historically, `InnoDB` used asynchronous I/O on
    Windows systems only. Starting with the InnoDB Plugin 1.1 and
    MySQL 5.5, `InnoDB` uses asynchronous I/O on
    Linux systems. This change introduces a dependency on
    `libaio`. Asynchronous I/O on Linux systems is
    configured using the
    [`innodb_use_native_aio`](innodb-parameters.md#sysvar_innodb_use_native_aio) option,
    which is enabled by default. On other Unix-like systems, InnoDB
    uses synchronous I/O only.

    See Also [buffer pool](glossary.md#glos_buffer_pool), [nonblocking I/O](glossary.md#glos_non_blocking_io).

atomic
:   In the SQL context,
    **transactions** are units of work
    that either succeed entirely (when
    **committed**) or have no effect at
    all (when **rolled back**). The
    indivisible ("atomic") property of transactions is the
    “A” in the acronym
    **ACID**.

    See Also [ACID](glossary.md#glos_acid), [commit](glossary.md#glos_commit), [rollback](glossary.md#glos_rollback), [transaction](glossary.md#glos_transaction).

atomic DDL
:   An atomic *DDL* statement is one that
    combines the *data dictionary* updates,
    *storage engine* operations, and
    *binary log* writes associated with a DDL
    operation into a single, atomic transaction. The transaction is
    either fully committed or rolled back, even if the server halts
    during the operation. Atomic DDL support was added in MySQL 8.0.
    For more information, see [Section 15.1.1, “Atomic Data Definition Statement Support”](atomic-ddl.md "15.1.1 Atomic Data Definition Statement Support").

    See Also [binary log](glossary.md#glos_binary_log), [data dictionary](glossary.md#glos_data_dictionary), [DDL](glossary.md#glos_ddl), [storage engine](glossary.md#glos_storage_engine).

atomic instruction
:   Special instructions provided by the CPU, to ensure that
    critical low-level operations cannot be interrupted.

authentication server
:   In Kerberos, a service that provides the initial ticket needed
    to obtain a ticket-granting ticket (TGT) that is needed to
    obtain other tickets from the ticket-granting server (TGS). The
    authentication server (AS) combined with a TGS make up a key
    distribution center (KDC).

    See Also [key distribution center](glossary.md#glos_key_distribution_center), [ticket-granting server](glossary.md#glos_ticket_granting_server).

auto-increment
:   A property of a table column (specified by the
    `AUTO_INCREMENT` keyword) that automatically
    adds an ascending sequence of values in the column.

    It saves work for the developer, not to have to produce new
    unique values when inserting new rows. It provides useful
    information for the query optimizer, because the column is known
    to be not null and with unique values. The values from such a
    column can be used as lookup keys in various contexts, and
    because they are auto-generated there is no reason to ever
    change them; for this reason, primary key columns are often
    specified as auto-incrementing.

    Auto-increment columns can be problematic with statement-based
    replication, because replaying the statements on a replica might
    not produce the same set of column values as on the source, due
    to timing issues. When you have an auto-incrementing primary
    key, you can use statement-based replication only with the
    setting
    [`innodb_autoinc_lock_mode=1`](innodb-parameters.md#sysvar_innodb_autoinc_lock_mode). If
    you have
    [`innodb_autoinc_lock_mode=2`](innodb-parameters.md#sysvar_innodb_autoinc_lock_mode),
    which allows higher concurrency for insert operations, use
    **row-based replication** rather
    than **statement-based
    replication**. The setting
    [`innodb_autoinc_lock_mode=0`](innodb-parameters.md#sysvar_innodb_autoinc_lock_mode)
    should not be used except for compatibility purposes.

    Consecutive lock mode
    ([`innodb_autoinc_lock_mode=1`](innodb-parameters.md#sysvar_innodb_autoinc_lock_mode)) is
    the default setting prior to MySQL 8.0.3. As of MySQL 8.0.3,
    interleaved lock mode
    ([`innodb_autoinc_lock_mode=2`](innodb-parameters.md#sysvar_innodb_autoinc_lock_mode)) is
    the default, which reflects the change from statement-based to
    row-based replication as the default replication type.

    See Also [auto-increment locking](glossary.md#glos_auto_increment_locking), [innodb\_autoinc\_lock\_mode](glossary.md#glos_innodb_autoinc_lock_mode), [primary key](glossary.md#glos_primary_key), [row-based replication](glossary.md#glos_row_based_replication), [statement-based replication](glossary.md#glos_statement_based_replication).

auto-increment locking
:   The convenience of an
    **auto-increment** primary key
    involves some tradeoff with concurrency. In the simplest case,
    if one transaction is inserting values into the table, any other
    transactions must wait to do their own inserts into that table,
    so that rows inserted by the first transaction receive
    consecutive primary key values. `InnoDB`
    includes optimizations and the
    [`innodb_autoinc_lock_mode`](innodb-parameters.md#sysvar_innodb_autoinc_lock_mode) option
    so that you can configure and optimal balance between
    predictable sequences of auto-increment values and maximum
    **concurrency** for insert
    operations.

    See Also [auto-increment](glossary.md#glos_auto_increment), [concurrency](glossary.md#glos_concurrency), [innodb\_autoinc\_lock\_mode](glossary.md#glos_innodb_autoinc_lock_mode).

autocommit
:   A setting that causes a **commit**
    operation after each **SQL**
    statement. This mode is not recommended for working with
    `InnoDB` tables with
    **transactions** that span several
    statements. It can help performance for
    **read-only transactions** on
    `InnoDB` tables, where it minimizes overhead
    from **locking** and generation of
    **undo** data, especially in MySQL
    5.6.4 and up. It is also appropriate for working with
    [`MyISAM`](myisam-storage-engine.md "18.2 The MyISAM Storage Engine") tables, where transactions
    are not applicable.

    See Also [commit](glossary.md#glos_commit), [locking](glossary.md#glos_locking), [read-only transaction](glossary.md#glos_read_only_transaction), [SQL](glossary.md#glos_sql), [transaction](glossary.md#glos_transaction), [undo](glossary.md#glos_undo).

availability
:   The ability to cope with, and if necessary recover from,
    failures on the host, including failures of MySQL, the operating
    system, or the hardware and maintenance activity that may
    otherwise cause downtime. Often paired with
    **scalability** as critical aspects
    of a large-scale deployment.

    See Also [scalability](glossary.md#glos_scalability).

MySQL Enterprise Backup
:   A licensed product that performs **hot
    backups** of MySQL databases. It offers the most
    efficiency and flexibility when backing up
    [`InnoDB`](innodb-storage-engine.md "Chapter 17 The InnoDB Storage Engine") tables, but can also back up
    [`MyISAM`](myisam-storage-engine.md "18.2 The MyISAM Storage Engine") and other kinds of tables.

    See Also [hot backup](glossary.md#glos_hot_backup), [InnoDB](glossary.md#glos_innodb).

### B

B-tree
:   A tree data structure that is popular for use in database
    indexes. The structure is kept sorted at all times, enabling
    fast lookup for exact matches (equals operator) and ranges (for
    example, greater than, less than, and `BETWEEN`
    operators). This type of index is available for most storage
    engines, such as [`InnoDB`](innodb-storage-engine.md "Chapter 17 The InnoDB Storage Engine") and
    [`MyISAM`](myisam-storage-engine.md "18.2 The MyISAM Storage Engine").

    Because B-tree nodes can have many children, a B-tree is not the
    same as a binary tree, which is limited to 2 children per node.

    Contrast with **hash index**, which
    is only available in the [`MEMORY`](memory-storage-engine.md "18.3 The MEMORY Storage Engine")
    storage engine. The `MEMORY` storage engine can
    also use B-tree indexes, and you should choose B-tree indexes
    for `MEMORY` tables if some queries use range
    operators.

    The use of the term B-tree is intended as a reference to the
    general class of index design. B-tree structures used by MySQL
    storage engines may be regarded as variants due to
    sophistications not present in a classic B-tree design. For
    related information, refer to the `InnoDB` Page
    Structure
    [Fil
    Header](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/internals/en/innodb-fil-header.html) section of the
    [MySQL
    Internals Manual](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/internals/en/index.html).

    See Also [hash index](glossary.md#glos_hash_index).

backticks
:   Identifiers within MySQL SQL statements must be quoted using the
    backtick character (`` ` ``) if they contain
    special characters or reserved words. For example, to refer to a
    table named `FOO#BAR` or a column named
    `SELECT`, you would specify the identifiers as
    `` `FOO#BAR` `` and `` `SELECT` ``.
    Since the backticks provide an extra level of safety, they are
    used extensively in program-generated SQL statements, where the
    identifier names might not be known in advance.

    Many other database systems use double quotation marks
    (`"`) around such special names. For
    portability, you can enable `ANSI_QUOTES` mode
    in MySQL and use double quotation marks instead of backticks to
    qualify identifier names.

    See Also [SQL](glossary.md#glos_sql).

backup
:   The process of copying some or all table data and metadata from
    a MySQL instance, for safekeeping. Can also refer to the set of
    copied files. This is a crucial task for DBAs. The reverse of
    this process is the **restore**
    operation.

    With MySQL, **physical backups**
    are performed by the **MySQL Enterprise Backup**
    product, and **logical backups**
    are performed by the `mysqldump` command. These
    techniques have different characteristics in terms of size and
    representation of the backup data, and speed (especially speed
    of the restore operation).

    Backups are further classified as
    **hot**,
    **warm**, or
    **cold** depending on how much they
    interfere with normal database operation. (Hot backups have the
    least interference, cold backups the most.)

    See Also [cold backup](glossary.md#glos_cold_backup), [hot backup](glossary.md#glos_hot_backup), [logical backup](glossary.md#glos_logical_backup), [MySQL Enterprise Backup](glossary.md#glos_mysql_enterprise_backup), [mysqldump](glossary.md#glos_mysqldump), [physical backup](glossary.md#glos_physical_backup), [warm backup](glossary.md#glos_warm_backup).

base column
:   A non-generated table column upon which a stored generated
    column or virtual generated column is based. In other words, a
    base column is a non-generated table column that is part of a
    generated column definition.

    See Also [generated column](glossary.md#glos_generated_column), [stored generated column](glossary.md#glos_stored_generated_column), [virtual generated column](glossary.md#glos_virtual_generated_column).

beta
:   An early stage in the life of a software product, when it is
    available only for evaluation, typically without a definite
    release number or a number less than 1.
    `InnoDB` does not use the beta designation,
    preferring an **early adopter**
    phase that can extend over several point releases, leading to a
    **GA** release.

    See Also [early adopter](glossary.md#glos_early_adopter), [GA](glossary.md#glos_ga).

binary log
:   A file containing a record of all statements or row changes that
    attempt to change table data. The contents of the binary log can
    be replayed to bring replicas up to date in a
    **replication** scenario, or to
    bring a database up to date after restoring table data from a
    backup. The binary logging feature can be turned on and off,
    although Oracle recommends always enabling it if you use
    replication or perform backups.

    You can examine the contents of the binary log, or replay it
    during replication or recovery, by using the
    [**mysqlbinlog**](mysqlbinlog.md "6.6.9 mysqlbinlog — Utility for Processing Binary Log Files") command. For full information
    about the binary log, see [Section 7.4.4, “The Binary Log”](binary-log.md "7.4.4 The Binary Log"). For
    MySQL configuration options related to the binary log, see
    [Section 19.1.6.4, “Binary Logging Options and Variables”](replication-options-binary-log.md "19.1.6.4 Binary Logging Options and Variables").

    For the **MySQL Enterprise Backup** product, the file
    name of the binary log and the current position within the file
    are important details. To record this information for the source
    when taking a backup in a replication context, you can specify
    the `--slave-info` option.

    Prior to MySQL 5.0, a similar capability was available, known as
    the update log. In MySQL 5.0 and higher, the binary log replaces
    the update log.

    See Also [binlog](glossary.md#glos_binlog), [MySQL Enterprise Backup](glossary.md#glos_mysql_enterprise_backup), [replication](glossary.md#glos_replication).

binlog
:   An informal name for the **binary
    log** file. For example, you might see this
    abbreviation used in e-mail messages or forum discussions.

    See Also [binary log](glossary.md#glos_binary_log).

blind query expansion
:   A special mode of **full-text
    search** enabled by the `WITH QUERY
    EXPANSION` clause. It performs the search twice, where
    the search phrase for the second search is the original search
    phrase concatenated with the few most highly relevant documents
    from the first search. This technique is mainly applicable for
    short search phrases, perhaps only a single word. It can uncover
    relevant matches where the precise search term does not occur in
    the document.

    See Also [full-text search](glossary.md#glos_full_text_search).

BLOB
:   An SQL data type ([`TINYBLOB`](blob.md "13.3.4 The BLOB and TEXT Types"),
    [`BLOB`](blob.md "13.3.4 The BLOB and TEXT Types"),
    [`MEDIUMBLOB`](blob.md "13.3.4 The BLOB and TEXT Types"), and
    [`LONGBLOB`](blob.md "13.3.4 The BLOB and TEXT Types")) for objects containing
    any kind of binary data, of arbitrary size. Used for storing
    documents, images, sound files, and other kinds of information
    that cannot easily be decomposed to rows and columns within a
    MySQL table. The techniques for handling BLOBs within a MySQL
    application vary with each
    **Connector** and
    **API**. MySQL
    `Connector/ODBC` defines
    `BLOB` values as
    `LONGVARBINARY`. For large, free-form
    collections of character data, the industry term is
    **CLOB**, represented by the MySQL
    `TEXT` data types.

    See Also [API](glossary.md#glos_api), [CLOB](glossary.md#glos_clob), [connector](glossary.md#glos_connector), [Connector/ODBC](glossary.md#glos_connector_odbc).

bottleneck
:   A portion of a system that is constrained in size or capacity,
    that has the effect of limiting overall throughput. For example,
    a memory area might be smaller than necessary; access to a
    single required resource might prevent multiple CPU cores from
    running simultaneously; or waiting for disk I/O to complete
    might prevent the CPU from running at full capacity. Removing
    bottlenecks tends to improve
    **concurrency**. For example, the
    ability to have multiple `InnoDB`
    **buffer pool** instances reduces
    contention when multiple sessions read from and write to the
    buffer pool simultaneously.

    See Also [buffer pool](glossary.md#glos_buffer_pool), [concurrency](glossary.md#glos_concurrency).

bounce
:   A **shutdown** operation
    immediately followed by a restart. Ideally with a relatively
    short **warmup** period so that
    performance and throughput quickly return to a high level.

    See Also [shutdown](glossary.md#glos_shutdown).

buddy allocator
:   A mechanism for managing different-sized
    **pages** in the InnoDB
    **buffer pool**.

    See Also [buffer pool](glossary.md#glos_buffer_pool), [page](glossary.md#glos_page), [page size](glossary.md#glos_page_size).

buffer
:   A memory or disk area used for temporary storage. Data is
    buffered in memory so that it can be written to disk
    efficiently, with a few large I/O operations rather than many
    small ones. Data is buffered on disk for greater reliability, so
    that it can be recovered even when a
    **crash** or other failure occurs
    at the worst possible time. The main types of buffers used by
    InnoDB are the **buffer pool**, the
    **doublewrite buffer**, and the
    **change buffer**.

    See Also [buffer pool](glossary.md#glos_buffer_pool), [change buffer](glossary.md#glos_change_buffer), [crash](glossary.md#glos_crash), [doublewrite buffer](glossary.md#glos_doublewrite_buffer).

buffer pool
:   The memory area that holds cached `InnoDB` data
    for both tables and indexes. For efficiency of high-volume read
    operations, the buffer pool is divided into
    **pages** that can potentially hold
    multiple rows. For efficiency of cache management, the buffer
    pool is implemented as a linked list of pages; data that is
    rarely used is aged out of the cache, using a variation of the
    **LRU** algorithm. On systems with
    large memory, you can improve concurrency by dividing the buffer
    pool into multiple **buffer pool
    instances**.

    Several `InnoDB` status variables,
    `INFORMATION_SCHEMA` tables, and
    `performance_schema` tables help to monitor the
    internal workings of the buffer pool. Starting in MySQL 5.6, you
    can avoid a lengthy warmup period after restarting the server,
    particularly for instances with large buffer pools, by saving
    the buffer pool state at server shutdown and restoring the
    buffer pool to the same state at server startup. See
    [Section 17.8.3.6, “Saving and Restoring the Buffer Pool State”](innodb-preload-buffer-pool.md "17.8.3.6 Saving and Restoring the Buffer Pool State").

    See Also [buffer pool instance](glossary.md#glos_buffer_pool_instance), [LRU](glossary.md#glos_lru), [page](glossary.md#glos_page), [warm up](glossary.md#glos_warm_up).

buffer pool instance
:   Any of the multiple regions into which the
    **buffer pool** can be divided,
    controlled by the
    [`innodb_buffer_pool_instances`](innodb-parameters.md#sysvar_innodb_buffer_pool_instances)
    configuration option. The total memory size specified by
    [`innodb_buffer_pool_size`](innodb-parameters.md#sysvar_innodb_buffer_pool_size) is
    divided among all buffer pool instances. Typically, having
    multiple buffer pool instances is appropriate for systems that
    allocate multiple gigabytes to the `InnoDB`
    buffer pool, with each instance being one gigabyte or larger. On
    systems loading or looking up large amounts of data in the
    buffer pool from many concurrent sessions, having multiple
    buffer pool instances reduces contention for exclusive access to
    data structures that manage the buffer pool.

    See Also [buffer pool](glossary.md#glos_buffer_pool).

built-in
:   The built-in `InnoDB` storage engine within
    MySQL is the original form of distribution for the storage
    engine. Contrast with the **InnoDB
    Plugin**. Starting with MySQL 5.5, the InnoDB Plugin is
    merged back into the MySQL code base as the built-in
    `InnoDB` storage engine (known as InnoDB 1.1).

    This distinction is important mainly in MySQL 5.1, where a
    feature or bug fix might apply to the InnoDB Plugin but not the
    built-in `InnoDB`, or vice versa.

    See Also [InnoDB](glossary.md#glos_innodb).

business rules
:   The relationships and sequences of actions that form the basis
    of business software, used to run a commercial company.
    Sometimes these rules are dictated by law, other times by
    company policy. Careful planning ensures that the relationships
    encoded and enforced by the database, and the actions performed
    through application logic, accurately reflect the real policies
    of the company and can handle real-life situations.

    For example, an employee leaving a company might trigger a
    sequence of actions from the human resources department. The
    human resources database might also need the flexibility to
    represent data about a person who has been hired, but not yet
    started work. Closing an account at an online service might
    result in data being removed from a database, or the data might
    be moved or flagged so that it could be recovered if the account
    is re-opened. A company might establish policies regarding
    salary maximums, minimums, and adjustments, in addition to basic
    sanity checks such as the salary not being a negative number. A
    retail database might not allow a purchase with the same serial
    number to be returned more than once, or might not allow credit
    card purchases above a certain value, while a database used to
    detect fraud might allow these kinds of things.

    See Also [relational](glossary.md#glos_relational).

### C

.cfg file
:   A metadata file used with the `InnoDB`
    **transportable tablespace**
    feature. It is produced by the command `FLUSH TABLES ...
    FOR EXPORT`, puts one or more tables in a consistent
    state that can be copied to another server. The
    `.cfg` file is copied along with the
    corresponding **.ibd file**, and
    used to adjust the internal values of the
    `.ibd` file, such as the
    **space ID**, during the
    `ALTER TABLE ... IMPORT TABLESPACE` step.

    See Also [.ibd file](glossary.md#glos_ibd_file), [space ID](glossary.md#glos_space_id), [transportable tablespace](glossary.md#glos_transportable_tablespace).

C
:   A programming language that combines portability with
    performance and access to low-level hardware features, making it
    a popular choice for writing operating systems, drivers, and
    other kinds of system software. Many complex applications,
    languages, and reusable modules feature pieces written in C,
    tied together with high-level components written in other
    languages. Its core syntax is familiar to
    **C++**,
    **Java**, and
    **C#** developers.

    See Also [C API](glossary.md#glos_c_api), [C++](glossary.md#glos_cplusplus), [C#](glossary.md#glos_csharp), [Java](glossary.md#glos_java).

C API
:   The C **API** code is distributed
    with MySQL. It is included in the
    **libmysqlclient** library and
    enables **C** programs to access a
    database.

    See Also [API](glossary.md#glos_api), [C](glossary.md#glos_c), [libmysqlclient](glossary.md#glos_libmysqlclient).

C#
:   A programming language combining strong typing and
    object-oriented features, running within the Microsoft
    **.NET** framework or its
    open-source counterpart **Mono**.
    Often used for creating applications with the
    **ASP.net** framework. Its syntax
    is familiar to **C**,
    **C++** and
    **Java** developers.

    See Also [.NET](glossary.md#glos__net), [ASP.net](glossary.md#glos_asp_net), [C](glossary.md#glos_c), [Connector/NET](glossary.md#glos_connector_net), [C++](glossary.md#glos_cplusplus), [Java](glossary.md#glos_java), [Mono](glossary.md#glos_mono).

C++
:   A programming language with core syntax familiar to
    **C** developers. Provides access
    to low-level operations for performance, combined with
    higher-level data types, object-oriented features, and garbage
    collection. To write C++ applications for MySQL, you use the
    **Connector/C++** component.

    See Also [C](glossary.md#glos_c), [Connector/C++](glossary.md#glos_connector_c__).

cache
:   The general term for any memory area that stores copies of data
    for frequent or high-speed retrieval. In
    `InnoDB`, the primary kind of cache structure
    is the **buffer pool**.

    See Also [buffer](glossary.md#glos_buffer), [buffer pool](glossary.md#glos_buffer_pool).

cardinality
:   The number of different values in a table
    **column**. When queries refer to
    columns that have an associated
    **index**, the cardinality of each
    column influences which access method is most efficient. For
    example, for a column with a **unique
    constraint**, the number of different values is equal
    to the number of rows in the table. If a table has a million
    rows but only 10 different values for a particular column, each
    value occurs (on average) 100,000 times. A query such as
    `SELECT c1 FROM t1 WHERE c1 = 50;` thus might
    return 1 row or a huge number of rows, and the database server
    might process the query differently depending on the cardinality
    of `c1`.

    If the values in a column have a very uneven distribution, the
    cardinality might not be a good way to determine the best query
    plan. For example, `SELECT c1 FROM t1 WHERE c1 =
    x;` might return 1 row when `x=50` and
    a million rows when `x=30`. In such a case, you
    might need to use **index hints**
    to pass along advice about which lookup method is more efficient
    for a particular query.

    Cardinality can also apply to the number of distinct values
    present in multiple columns, as in a
    **composite index**.

    See Also [column](glossary.md#glos_column), [composite index](glossary.md#glos_composite_index), [index](glossary.md#glos_index), [index hint](glossary.md#glos_index_hint), [persistent statistics](glossary.md#glos_persistent_statistics), [random dive](glossary.md#glos_random_dive), [selectivity](glossary.md#glos_selectivity), [unique constraint](glossary.md#glos_unique_constraint).

change buffer
:   A special data structure that records changes to
    **pages** in
    **secondary indexes**. These values
    could result from SQL [`INSERT`](insert.md "15.2.7 INSERT Statement"),
    [`UPDATE`](update.md "15.2.17 UPDATE Statement"), or
    [`DELETE`](delete.md "15.2.2 DELETE Statement") statements
    (**DML**). The set of features
    involving the change buffer is known collectively as
    **change buffering**, consisting of
    **insert buffering**,
    **delete buffering**, and
    **purge buffering**.

    Changes are only recorded in the change buffer when the relevant
    page from the secondary index is not in the
    **buffer pool**. When the relevant
    index page is brought into the buffer pool while associated
    changes are still in the change buffer, the changes for that
    page are applied in the buffer pool
    (**merged**) using the data from
    the change buffer. Periodically, the
    **purge** operation that runs
    during times when the system is mostly idle, or during a slow
    shutdown, writes the new index pages to disk. The purge
    operation can write the disk blocks for a series of index values
    more efficiently than if each value were written to disk
    immediately.

    Physically, the change buffer is part of the
    **system tablespace**, so that the
    index changes remain buffered across database restarts. The
    changes are only applied
    (**merged**) when the pages are
    brought into the buffer pool due to some other read operation.

    The kinds and amount of data stored in the change buffer are
    governed by the
    [`innodb_change_buffering`](innodb-parameters.md#sysvar_innodb_change_buffering) and
    [`innodb_change_buffer_max_size`](innodb-parameters.md#sysvar_innodb_change_buffer_max_size)
    configuration options. To see information about the current data
    in the change buffer, issue the
    [`SHOW ENGINE INNODB
    STATUS`](show-engine.md "15.7.7.15 SHOW ENGINE Statement") command.

    Formerly known as the **insert
    buffer**.

    See Also [buffer pool](glossary.md#glos_buffer_pool), [change buffering](glossary.md#glos_change_buffering), [delete buffering](glossary.md#glos_delete_buffering), [DML](glossary.md#glos_dml), [insert buffer](glossary.md#glos_insert_buffer), [insert buffering](glossary.md#glos_insert_buffering), [merge](glossary.md#glos_merge), [page](glossary.md#glos_page), [purge](glossary.md#glos_purge), [purge buffering](glossary.md#glos_purge_buffering), [secondary index](glossary.md#glos_secondary_index), [system tablespace](glossary.md#glos_system_tablespace).

change buffering
:   The general term for the features involving the
    **change buffer**, consisting of
    **insert buffering**,
    **delete buffering**, and
    **purge buffering**. Index changes
    resulting from SQL statements, which could normally involve
    random I/O operations, are held back and performed periodically
    by a background **thread**. This
    sequence of operations can write the disk blocks for a series of
    index values more efficiently than if each value were written to
    disk immediately. Controlled by the
    [`innodb_change_buffering`](innodb-parameters.md#sysvar_innodb_change_buffering) and
    [`innodb_change_buffer_max_size`](innodb-parameters.md#sysvar_innodb_change_buffer_max_size)
    configuration options.

    See Also [change buffer](glossary.md#glos_change_buffer), [delete buffering](glossary.md#glos_delete_buffering), [insert buffering](glossary.md#glos_insert_buffering), [purge buffering](glossary.md#glos_purge_buffering).

checkpoint
:   As changes are made to data pages that are cached in the
    **buffer pool**, those changes are
    written to the **data files**
    sometime later, a process known as
    **flushing**. The checkpoint is a
    record of the latest changes (represented by an
    **LSN** value) that have been
    successfully written to the data files.

    See Also [buffer pool](glossary.md#glos_buffer_pool), [data files](glossary.md#glos_data_files), [flush](glossary.md#glos_flush), [fuzzy checkpointing](glossary.md#glos_fuzzy_checkpointing), [LSN](glossary.md#glos_lsn).

checksum
:   In `InnoDB`, a validation mechanism to detect
    corruption when a **page** in a
    **tablespace** is read from disk
    into the `InnoDB` **buffer
    pool**. This feature is controlled by the
    `innodb_checksums` configuration option in
    MySQL 5.5. `innodb_checksums` is deprecated in
    MySQL 5.6.3, replaced by
    [`innodb_checksum_algorithm`](innodb-parameters.md#sysvar_innodb_checksum_algorithm).

    The [**innochecksum**](innochecksum.md "6.6.2 innochecksum — Offline InnoDB File Checksum Utility") command helps diagnose
    corruption problems by testing the checksum values for a
    specified **tablespace** file while
    the MySQL server is shut down.

    MySQL also uses checksums for replication purposes. For details,
    see the configuration options
    [`binlog_checksum`](replication-options-binary-log.md#sysvar_binlog_checksum),
    [`source_verify_checksum`](replication-options-binary-log.md#sysvar_source_verify_checksum) or
    [`master_verify_checksum`](replication-options-binary-log.md#sysvar_master_verify_checksum), and
    [`replica_sql_verify_checksum`](replication-options-replica.md#sysvar_replica_sql_verify_checksum) or
    [`slave_sql_verify_checksum`](replication-options-replica.md#sysvar_slave_sql_verify_checksum).

    See Also [buffer pool](glossary.md#glos_buffer_pool), [page](glossary.md#glos_page), [tablespace](glossary.md#glos_tablespace).

child table
:   In a **foreign key** relationship,
    a child table is one whose rows refer (or point) to rows in
    another table with an identical value for a specific column.
    This is the table that contains the `FOREIGN KEY ...
    REFERENCES` clause and optionally `ON
    UPDATE` and `ON DELETE` clauses. The
    corresponding row in the **parent
    table** must exist before the row can be created in the
    child table. The values in the child table can prevent delete or
    update operations on the parent table, or can cause automatic
    deletion or updates in the child table, based on the `ON
    CASCADE` option used when creating the foreign key.

    See Also [foreign key](glossary.md#glos_foreign_key), [parent table](glossary.md#glos_parent_table).

clean page
:   A **page** in the
    `InnoDB` **buffer
    pool** where all changes made in memory have also been
    written (**flushed**) to the
    [data files](glossary.md#glos_data_files "data files"). The opposite
    of a **dirty page**.

    See Also [buffer pool](glossary.md#glos_buffer_pool), [data files](glossary.md#glos_data_files), [dirty page](glossary.md#glos_dirty_page), [flush](glossary.md#glos_flush), [page](glossary.md#glos_page).

clean shutdown
:   A **shutdown** that completes
    without errors and applies all changes to
    `InnoDB` tables before finishing, as opposed to
    a **crash** or a
    **fast shutdown**. Synonym for
    **slow shutdown**.

    See Also [crash](glossary.md#glos_crash), [fast shutdown](glossary.md#glos_fast_shutdown), [shutdown](glossary.md#glos_shutdown), [slow shutdown](glossary.md#glos_slow_shutdown).

client
:   A program that runs outside the database server, communicating
    with the database by sending requests through a
    **Connector**, or an
    **API** made available through
    **client libraries**. It can run on
    the same physical machine as the database server, or on a remote
    machine connected over a network. It can be a special-purpose
    database application, or a general-purpose program like the
    [**mysql**](mysql.md "6.5.1 mysql — The MySQL Command-Line Client") command-line processor.

    See Also [API](glossary.md#glos_api), [client libraries](glossary.md#glos_client_libraries), [connector](glossary.md#glos_connector), [mysql](glossary.md#glos_mysql), [server](glossary.md#glos_server).

client libraries
:   Files containing collections of functions for working with
    databases. By compiling your program with these libraries, or
    installing them on the same system as your application, you can
    run a database application (known as a
    **client**) on a machine that does
    not have the MySQL server installed; the application accesses
    the database over a network. With MySQL, you can use the
    **libmysqlclient** library from the
    MySQL server itself.

    See Also [client](glossary.md#glos_client), [libmysqlclient](glossary.md#glos_libmysqlclient).

client-side prepared statement
:   A type of **prepared statement**
    where the caching and reuse are managed locally, emulating the
    functionality of **server-side prepared
    statements**. Historically, used by some
    **Connector/J**,
    **Connector/ODBC**, and
    **Connector/PHP** developers to
    work around issues with server-side stored procedures. With
    modern MySQL server versions, server-side prepared statements
    are recommended for performance, scalability, and memory
    efficiency.

    See Also [Connector/J](glossary.md#glos_connector_j), [Connector/ODBC](glossary.md#glos_connector_odbc), [Connector/PHP](glossary.md#glos_connector_php), [prepared statement](glossary.md#glos_prepared_statement).

CLOB
:   An SQL data type ([`TINYTEXT`](blob.md "13.3.4 The BLOB and TEXT Types"),
    [`TEXT`](blob.md "13.3.4 The BLOB and TEXT Types"),
    [`MEDIUMTEXT`](blob.md "13.3.4 The BLOB and TEXT Types"), or
    [`LONGTEXT`](blob.md "13.3.4 The BLOB and TEXT Types")) for objects containing
    any kind of character data, of arbitrary size. Used for storing
    text-based documents, with associated character set and
    collation order. The techniques for handling CLOBs within a
    MySQL application vary with each
    **Connector** and
    **API**. MySQL Connector/ODBC
    defines `TEXT` values as
    `LONGVARCHAR`. For storing binary data, the
    equivalent is the **BLOB** type.

    See Also [API](glossary.md#glos_api), [BLOB](glossary.md#glos_blob), [connector](glossary.md#glos_connector), [Connector/ODBC](glossary.md#glos_connector_odbc).

clustered index
:   The `InnoDB` term for a
    **primary key** index.
    `InnoDB` table storage is organized based on
    the values of the primary key columns, to speed up queries and
    sorts involving the primary key columns. For best performance,
    choose the primary key columns carefully based on the most
    performance-critical queries. Because modifying the columns of
    the clustered index is an expensive operation, choose primary
    columns that are rarely or never updated.

    In the Oracle Database product, this type of table is known as
    an **index-organized table**.

    See Also [index](glossary.md#glos_index), [primary key](glossary.md#glos_primary_key), [secondary index](glossary.md#glos_secondary_index).

cold backup
:   A **backup** taken while the
    database is shut down. For busy applications and websites, this
    might not be practical, and you might prefer a
    **warm backup** or a
    **hot backup**.

    See Also [backup](glossary.md#glos_backup), [hot backup](glossary.md#glos_hot_backup), [warm backup](glossary.md#glos_warm_backup).

column
:   A data item within a **row**, whose
    storage and semantics are defined by a data type. Each
    **table** and
    **index** is largely defined by the
    set of columns it contains.

    Each column has a **cardinality**
    value. A column can be the **primary
    key** for its table, or part of the primary key. A
    column can be subject to a **unique
    constraint**, a **NOT NULL
    constraint**, or both. Values in different columns,
    even across different tables, can be linked by a
    **foreign key** relationship.

    In discussions of MySQL internal operations, sometimes
    **field** is used as a synonym.

    See Also [cardinality](glossary.md#glos_cardinality), [foreign key](glossary.md#glos_foreign_key), [index](glossary.md#glos_index), [NOT NULL constraint](glossary.md#glos_not_null_constraint), [primary key](glossary.md#glos_primary_key), [row](glossary.md#glos_row), [table](glossary.md#glos_table), [unique constraint](glossary.md#glos_unique_constraint).

column index
:   An **index** on a single column.

    See Also [composite index](glossary.md#glos_composite_index), [index](glossary.md#glos_index).

column prefix
:   When an **index** is created with a
    length specification, such as `CREATE INDEX idx ON t1
    (c1(N))`, only the first N characters of the column
    value are stored in the index. Keeping the index prefix small
    makes the index compact, and the memory and disk I/O savings
    help performance. (Although making the index prefix too small
    can hinder query optimization by making rows with different
    values appear to the query optimizer to be duplicates.)

    For columns containing binary values or long text strings, where
    sorting is not a major consideration and storing the entire
    value in the index would waste space, the index automatically
    uses the first N (typically 768) characters of the value to do
    lookups and sorts.

    See Also [index](glossary.md#glos_index).

command interceptor
:   Synonym for **statement
    interceptor**. One aspect of the
    **interceptor** design pattern
    available for both **Connector/NET** and
    **Connector/J**. What Connector/NET calls
    a command, Connector/J refers to as a statement. Contrast with
    **exception interceptor**.

    See Also [Connector/J](glossary.md#glos_connector_j), [Connector/NET](glossary.md#glos_connector_net), [exception interceptor](glossary.md#glos_exception_interceptor), [interceptor](glossary.md#glos_interceptor), [statement interceptor](glossary.md#glos_statement_interceptor).

commit
:   A **SQL** statement that ends a
    **transaction**, making permanent
    any changes made by the transaction. It is the opposite of
    **rollback**, which undoes any
    changes made in the transaction.

    `InnoDB` uses an
    **optimistic** mechanism for
    commits, so that changes can be written to the data files before
    the commit actually occurs. This technique makes the commit
    itself faster, with the tradeoff that more work is required in
    case of a rollback.

    By default, MySQL uses the
    **autocommit** setting, which
    automatically issues a commit following each SQL statement.

    See Also [autocommit](glossary.md#glos_autocommit), [optimistic](glossary.md#glos_optimistic), [rollback](glossary.md#glos_rollback), [SQL](glossary.md#glos_sql), [transaction](glossary.md#glos_transaction).

compact row format
:   A **row format** for InnoDB tables.
    It was the default row format from MySQL 5.0.3 to MySQL 5.7.8.
    In MySQL 8.0, the default row format is defined by the
    [`innodb_default_row_format`](innodb-parameters.md#sysvar_innodb_default_row_format)
    configuration option, which has a default setting of
    **DYNAMIC**. The
    **COMPACT** row format provides a
    more compact representation for nulls and variable-length
    columns than the **REDUNDANT** row
    format.

    For additional information about `InnoDB`
    `COMPACT` row format, see
    [Section 17.10, “InnoDB Row Formats”](innodb-row-format.md "17.10 InnoDB Row Formats").

    See Also [dynamic row format](glossary.md#glos_dynamic_row_format), [file format](glossary.md#glos_file_format), [redundant row format](glossary.md#glos_redundant_row_format), [row format](glossary.md#glos_row_format).

composite index
:   An **index** that includes multiple
    columns.

    See Also [index](glossary.md#glos_index).

compressed backup
:   The compression feature of the
    **MySQL Enterprise Backup** product makes a
    compressed copy of each tablespace, changing the extension from
    `.ibd` to `.ibz`. Compressing
    backup data allows you to keep more backups on hand, and reduces
    the time to transfer backups to a different server. The data is
    uncompressed during the restore operation. When a compressed
    backup operation processes a table that is already compressed,
    it skips the compression step for that table, because
    compressing again would result in little or no space savings.

    A set of files produced by the
    **MySQL Enterprise Backup** product, where each
    **tablespace** is compressed. The
    compressed files are renamed with a `.ibz` file
    extension.

    Applying **compression** at the
    start of the backup process helps to avoid storage overhead
    during the compression process, and to avoid network overhead
    when transferring the backup files to another server. The
    process of **applying** the
    **binary log** takes longer, and
    requires uncompressing the backup files.

    See Also [apply](glossary.md#glos_apply), [binary log](glossary.md#glos_binary_log), [compression](glossary.md#glos_compression), [hot backup](glossary.md#glos_hot_backup), [MySQL Enterprise Backup](glossary.md#glos_mysql_enterprise_backup), [tablespace](glossary.md#glos_tablespace).

compressed row format
:   A **row format** that enables data
    and index **compression** for
    `InnoDB` tables. Large fields are stored away
    from the page that holds the rest of the row data, as in
    **dynamic row format**. Both index
    pages and the large fields are compressed, yielding memory and
    disk savings. Depending on the structure of the data, the
    decrease in memory and disk usage might or might not outweigh
    the performance overhead of uncompressing the data as it is
    used. See [Section 17.9, “InnoDB Table and Page Compression”](innodb-compression.md "17.9 InnoDB Table and Page Compression") for usage
    details.

    For additional information about `InnoDB`
    `COMPRESSED` row format, see
    [DYNAMIC Row Format](innodb-row-format.md#innodb-row-format-dynamic "DYNAMIC Row Format").

    See Also [compression](glossary.md#glos_compression), [dynamic row format](glossary.md#glos_dynamic_row_format), [row format](glossary.md#glos_row_format).

compressed table
:   A table for which the data is stored in compressed form. For
    `InnoDB`, it is a table created with
    `ROW_FORMAT=COMPRESSED`. See
    [Section 17.9, “InnoDB Table and Page Compression”](innodb-compression.md "17.9 InnoDB Table and Page Compression") for more information.

    See Also [compressed row format](glossary.md#glos_compressed_row_format), [compression](glossary.md#glos_compression).

compression
:   A feature with wide-ranging benefits from using less disk space,
    performing less I/O, and using less memory for caching.

    `InnoDB` supports both table-level and
    page-level compression. `InnoDB` page
    compression is also referred to as
    **transparent page compression**.
    For more information about `InnoDB`
    compression, see [Section 17.9, “InnoDB Table and Page Compression”](innodb-compression.md "17.9 InnoDB Table and Page Compression").

    Another type of compression is the
    **compressed backup** feature of
    the **MySQL Enterprise Backup** product.

    See Also [buffer pool](glossary.md#glos_buffer_pool), [compressed backup](glossary.md#glos_compressed_backup), [compressed row format](glossary.md#glos_compressed_row_format), [DML](glossary.md#glos_dml), [transparent page compression](glossary.md#glos_transparent_page_compression).

compression failure
:   Not actually an error, rather an expensive operation that can
    occur when using **compression** in
    combination with **DML**
    operations. It occurs when: updates to a compressed
    **page** overflow the area on the
    page reserved for recording modifications; the page is
    compressed again, with all changes applied to the table data;
    the re-compressed data does not fit on the original page,
    requiring MySQL to split the data into two new pages and
    compress each one separately. To check the frequency of this
    condition, query the
    [`INFORMATION_SCHEMA.INNODB_CMP`](information-schema-innodb-cmp-table.md "28.4.6 The INFORMATION_SCHEMA INNODB_CMP and INNODB_CMP_RESET Tables") table
    and check how much the value of the
    `COMPRESS_OPS` column exceeds the value of the
    `COMPRESS_OPS_OK` column. Ideally, compression
    failures do not occur often; when they do, you can adjust the
    [`innodb_compression_level`](innodb-parameters.md#sysvar_innodb_compression_level),
    [`innodb_compression_failure_threshold_pct`](innodb-parameters.md#sysvar_innodb_compression_failure_threshold_pct),
    and
    [`innodb_compression_pad_pct_max`](innodb-parameters.md#sysvar_innodb_compression_pad_pct_max)
    configuration options.

    See Also [compression](glossary.md#glos_compression), [DML](glossary.md#glos_dml), [page](glossary.md#glos_page).

concatenated index
:   See [composite index](glossary.md#glos_composite_index).

concurrency
:   The ability of multiple operations (in database terminology,
    **transactions**) to run
    simultaneously, without interfering with each other. Concurrency
    is also involved with performance, because ideally the
    protection for multiple simultaneous transactions works with a
    minimum of performance overhead, using efficient mechanisms for
    **locking**.

    See Also [ACID](glossary.md#glos_acid), [locking](glossary.md#glos_locking), [transaction](glossary.md#glos_transaction).

configuration file
:   The file that holds the **option**
    values used by MySQL at startup. Traditionally, on Linux and
    Unix this file is named `my.cnf`, and on
    Windows it is named `my.ini`. You can set a
    number of options related to InnoDB under the
    `[mysqld]` section of the file.

    See [Section 6.2.2.2, “Using Option Files”](option-files.md "6.2.2.2 Using Option Files") for information about where
    MySQL searches for configuration files.

    When you use the **MySQL Enterprise Backup** product,
    you typically use two configuration files: one that specifies
    where the data comes from and how it is structured (which could
    be the original configuration file for your server), and a
    stripped-down one containing only a small set of options that
    specify where the backup data goes and how it is structured. The
    configuration files used with the
    **MySQL Enterprise Backup** product must contain
    certain options that are typically left out of regular
    configuration files, so you might need to add options to your
    existing configuration file for use with
    **MySQL Enterprise Backup**.

    See Also [my.cnf](glossary.md#glos_my_cnf), [MySQL Enterprise Backup](glossary.md#glos_mysql_enterprise_backup), [option](glossary.md#glos_option), [option file](glossary.md#glos_option_file).

connection
:   The communication channel between an application and a MySQL
    server. The performance and scalability of a database
    applications is influenced by on how quickly a database
    connection can be established, how many can be made
    simultaneously, and how long they persist. The parameters such
    as **host**,
    **port**, and so on are represented
    as a **connection string** in
    **Connector/NET**, and as a
    **DSN** in
    **Connector/ODBC**. High-traffic
    systems make use of an optimization known as the
    **connection pool**.

    See Also [connection pool](glossary.md#glos_connection_pool), [connection string](glossary.md#glos_connection_string), [Connector/NET](glossary.md#glos_connector_net), [Connector/ODBC](glossary.md#glos_connector_odbc), [DSN](glossary.md#glos_dsn), [host](glossary.md#glos_host), [port](glossary.md#glos_port).

connection pool
:   A cache area that allows database
    **connections** to be reused within
    the same application or across different applications, rather
    than setting up and tearing down a new connection for every
    database operation. This technique is common with
    **J2EE** application servers.
    **Java** applications using
    **Connector/J** can use the
    connection pool features of
    **Tomcat** and other application
    servers. The reuse is transparent to applications; the
    application still opens and closes the connection as usual.

    See Also [connection](glossary.md#glos_connection), [Connector/J](glossary.md#glos_connector_j), [J2EE](glossary.md#glos_j2ee), [Tomcat](glossary.md#glos_tomcat).

connection string
:   A representation of the parameters for a database
    **connection**, encoded as a string
    literal so that it can be used in program code. The parts of the
    string represent connection parameters such as
    **host** and
    **port**. A connection string
    contains several key-value pairs, separated by semicolons. Each
    key-value pair is joined with an equal sign. Frequently used
    with **Connector/NET** applications; see
    [Creating a Connector/NET Connection String](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/connector-net/en/connector-net-connections-string.html) for details.

    See Also [connection](glossary.md#glos_connection), [Connector/NET](glossary.md#glos_connector_net), [host](glossary.md#glos_host), [port](glossary.md#glos_port).

connector
:   MySQL Connectors provide connectivity to the MySQL server for
    **client** programs. Several
    programming languages and frameworks each have their own
    associated Connector. Contrast with the lower-level access
    provided by an **API**.

    See Also [API](glossary.md#glos_api), [client](glossary.md#glos_client), [Connector/C++](glossary.md#glos_connector_c__), [Connector/J](glossary.md#glos_connector_j), [Connector/NET](glossary.md#glos_connector_net), [Connector/ODBC](glossary.md#glos_connector_odbc).

Connector/C++
:   Connector/C++ 8.0 can be used to access MySQL servers that implement a
    [document store](document-store.md "Chapter 22 Using MySQL as a Document Store"), or in a
    traditional way using SQL queries. It enables development of C++
    applications using X DevAPI, or plain C applications using
    X DevAPI for C. It also enables development of C++ applications that
    use the legacy JDBC-based API from Connector/C++ 1.1. For more
    information, see [MySQL Connector/C++ 9.5 Developer Guide](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/connector-cpp/9.4/en/).

    See Also [client](glossary.md#glos_client), [connector](glossary.md#glos_connector), [JDBC](glossary.md#glos_jdbc).

Connector/J
:   A **JDBC** driver that provides
    connectivity for **client**
    applications developed in the
    **Java** programming language.
    MySQL Connector/J is a JDBC Type 4 driver: a pure-Java
    implementation of the MySQL protocol that does not rely on the
    MySQL **client libraries**. For
    full details, see [MySQL Connector/J Developer Guide](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/connector-j/en/).

    See Also [client](glossary.md#glos_client), [client libraries](glossary.md#glos_client_libraries), [connector](glossary.md#glos_connector), [Java](glossary.md#glos_java), [JDBC](glossary.md#glos_jdbc).

Connector/NET
:   A MySQL **connector** for
    developers writing applications using languages, technologies,
    and frameworks such as **C#**,
    **.NET**,
    **Mono**,
    **Visual Studio**,
    **ASP.net**, and
    **ADO.net**.

    See Also [ADO.NET](glossary.md#glos_ado_net), [ASP.net](glossary.md#glos_asp_net), [connector](glossary.md#glos_connector), [C#](glossary.md#glos_csharp), [Mono](glossary.md#glos_mono), [Visual Studio](glossary.md#glos_visual_studio).

Connector/ODBC
:   The family of MySQL ODBC drivers that provide access to a MySQL
    database using the industry standard Open Database Connectivity
    (**ODBC**) API. Formerly called
    MyODBC drivers. For full details, see
    [MySQL Connector/ODBC Developer Guide](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/connector-odbc/en/).

    See Also [connector](glossary.md#glos_connector), [ODBC](glossary.md#glos_odbc).

Connector/PHP
:   A version of the `mysql` and
    `mysqli` **APIs**
    for **PHP** optimized for the
    Windows operating system.

    See Also [connector](glossary.md#glos_connector), [PHP](glossary.md#glos_php), [PHP API](glossary.md#glos_php_api).

consistent read
:   A read operation that uses
    **snapshot** information to present
    query results based on a point in time, regardless of changes
    performed by other transactions running at the same time. If
    queried data has been changed by another transaction, the
    original data is reconstructed based on the contents of the
    **undo log**. This technique avoids
    some of the **locking** issues that
    can reduce **concurrency** by
    forcing transactions to wait for other transactions to finish.

    With **REPEATABLE READ**
    **isolation level**, the snapshot
    is based on the time when the first read operation is performed.
    With **READ COMMITTED** isolation
    level, the snapshot is reset to the time of each consistent read
    operation.

    Consistent read is the default mode in which
    `InnoDB` processes `SELECT`
    statements in **READ COMMITTED**
    and **REPEATABLE READ** isolation
    levels. Because a consistent read does not set any locks on the
    tables it accesses, other sessions are free to modify those
    tables while a consistent read is being performed on the table.

    For technical details about the applicable isolation levels, see
    [Section 17.7.2.3, “Consistent Nonlocking Reads”](innodb-consistent-read.md "17.7.2.3 Consistent Nonlocking Reads").

    See Also [concurrency](glossary.md#glos_concurrency), [isolation level](glossary.md#glos_isolation_level), [locking](glossary.md#glos_locking), [READ COMMITTED](glossary.md#glos_read_committed), [REPEATABLE READ](glossary.md#glos_repeatable_read), [snapshot](glossary.md#glos_snapshot), [transaction](glossary.md#glos_transaction), [undo log](glossary.md#glos_undo_log).

constraint
:   An automatic test that can block database changes to prevent
    data from becoming inconsistent. (In computer science terms, a
    kind of assertion related to an invariant condition.)
    Constraints are a crucial component of the
    **ACID** philosophy, to maintain
    data consistency. Constraints supported by MySQL include
    **FOREIGN KEY constraints** and
    **unique constraints**.

    See Also [ACID](glossary.md#glos_acid), [foreign key](glossary.md#glos_foreign_key), [unique constraint](glossary.md#glos_unique_constraint).

counter
:   A value that is incremented by a particular kind of
    `InnoDB` operation. Useful for measuring how
    busy a server is, troubleshooting the sources of performance
    issues, and testing whether changes (for example, to
    configuration settings or indexes used by queries) have the
    desired low-level effects. Different kinds of counters are
    available through **Performance
    Schema** tables and
    **INFORMATION\_SCHEMA** tables,
    particularly
    `INFORMATION_SCHEMA.INNODB_METRICS`.

    See Also [INFORMATION\_SCHEMA](glossary.md#glos_information_schema), [metrics counter](glossary.md#glos_metrics_counter), [Performance Schema](glossary.md#glos_performance_schema).

covering index
:   An **index** that includes all the
    columns retrieved by a query. Instead of using the index values
    as pointers to find the full table rows, the query returns
    values from the index structure, saving disk I/O.
    `InnoDB` can apply this optimization technique
    to more indexes than MyISAM can, because
    `InnoDB` **secondary
    indexes** also include the
    **primary key** columns.
    `InnoDB` cannot apply this technique for
    queries against tables modified by a transaction, until that
    transaction ends.

    Any **column index** or
    **composite index** could act as a
    covering index, given the right query. Design your indexes and
    queries to take advantage of this optimization technique
    wherever possible.

    See Also [column index](glossary.md#glos_column_index), [composite index](glossary.md#glos_composite_index), [index](glossary.md#glos_index), [primary key](glossary.md#glos_primary_key), [secondary index](glossary.md#glos_secondary_index).

CPU-bound
:   A type of **workload** where the
    primary **bottleneck** is CPU
    operations in memory. Typically involves read-intensive
    operations where the results can all be cached in the
    **buffer pool**.

    See Also [bottleneck](glossary.md#glos_bottleneck), [buffer pool](glossary.md#glos_buffer_pool), [workload](glossary.md#glos_workload).

crash
:   MySQL uses the term “crash” to refer generally to
    any unexpected **shutdown**
    operation where the server cannot do its normal cleanup. For
    example, a crash could happen due to a hardware fault on the
    database server machine or storage device; a power failure; a
    potential data mismatch that causes the MySQL server to halt; a
    **fast shutdown** initiated by the
    DBA; or many other reasons. The robust, automatic
    **crash recovery** for
    **InnoDB** tables ensures that data
    is made consistent when the server is restarted, without any
    extra work for the DBA.

    See Also [crash recovery](glossary.md#glos_crash_recovery), [fast shutdown](glossary.md#glos_fast_shutdown), [InnoDB](glossary.md#glos_innodb), [shutdown](glossary.md#glos_shutdown).

crash recovery
:   The cleanup activities that occur when MySQL is started again
    after a **crash**. For
    **InnoDB** tables, changes from
    incomplete transactions are replayed using data from the
    **redo log**. Changes that were
    **committed** before the crash, but
    not yet written into the **data
    files**, are reconstructed from the
    **doublewrite buffer**. When the
    database is shut down normally, this type of activity is
    performed during shutdown by the
    **purge** operation.

    During normal operation, committed data can be stored in the
    **change buffer** for a period of
    time before being written to the data files. There is always a
    tradeoff between keeping the data files up-to-date, which
    introduces performance overhead during normal operation, and
    buffering the data, which can make shutdown and crash recovery
    take longer.

    See Also [change buffer](glossary.md#glos_change_buffer), [commit](glossary.md#glos_commit), [crash](glossary.md#glos_crash), [data files](glossary.md#glos_data_files), [doublewrite buffer](glossary.md#glos_doublewrite_buffer), [InnoDB](glossary.md#glos_innodb), [purge](glossary.md#glos_purge), [redo log](glossary.md#glos_redo_log).

CRUD
:   Acronym for “create, read, update, delete”, a
    common sequence of operations in database applications. Often
    denotes a class of applications with relatively simple database
    usage (basic **DDL**,
    **DML** and
    **query** statements in
    **SQL**) that can be implemented
    quickly in any language.

    See Also [DDL](glossary.md#glos_ddl), [DML](glossary.md#glos_dml), [query](glossary.md#glos_query), [SQL](glossary.md#glos_sql).

cursor
:   An internal MySQL data structure that represents the result set
    of an SQL statement. Often used with
    **prepared statements** and
    **dynamic SQL**. It works like an
    iterator in other high-level languages, producing each value
    from the result set as requested.

    Although SQL usually handles the processing of cursors for you,
    you might delve into the inner workings when dealing with
    performance-critical code.

    See Also [dynamic SQL](glossary.md#glos_dynamic_sql), [prepared statement](glossary.md#glos_prepared_statement), [query](glossary.md#glos_query).

### D

data definition language
:   See [DDL](glossary.md#glos_ddl).

data dictionary
:   Metadata that keeps track of database objects such as
    **tables**,
    **indexes**, and table
    **columns**. For the MySQL data
    dictionary, introduced in MySQL 8.0, metadata is physically
    located in `InnoDB`
    **file-per-table** tablespace files
    in the `mysql` database directory. For the
    `InnoDB` data dictionary, metadata is
    physically located in the `InnoDB`
    **system tablespace**.

    Because the **MySQL Enterprise Backup** product
    always backs up the `InnoDB` system tablespace,
    all backups include the contents of the
    `InnoDB` data dictionary.

    See Also [column](glossary.md#glos_column), [file-per-table](glossary.md#glos_file_per_table), [.frm file](glossary.md#glos_frm_file), [index](glossary.md#glos_index), [MySQL Enterprise Backup](glossary.md#glos_mysql_enterprise_backup), [system tablespace](glossary.md#glos_system_tablespace), [table](glossary.md#glos_table).

data directory
:   The directory under which each MySQL
    **instance** keeps the
    **data files** for
    `InnoDB` and the directories representing
    individual databases. Controlled by the
    [`datadir`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_datadir) configuration option.

    See Also [data files](glossary.md#glos_data_files), [instance](glossary.md#glos_instance).

data files
:   The files that physically contain
    **table** and
    **index** data.

    The `InnoDB` **system
    tablespace**, which holds the `InnoDB`
    **data dictionary** and is capable
    of holding data for multiple `InnoDB` tables,
    is represented by one or more `.ibdata` data
    files.

    File-per-table tablespaces, which hold data for a single
    `InnoDB` table, are represented by a
    `.ibd` data file.

    General tablespaces (introduced in MySQL 5.7.6), which can hold
    data for multiple `InnoDB` tables, are also
    represented by a `.ibd` data file.

    See Also [data dictionary](glossary.md#glos_data_dictionary), [file-per-table](glossary.md#glos_file_per_table), [general tablespace](glossary.md#glos_general_tablespace), [.ibd file](glossary.md#glos_ibd_file), [ibdata file](glossary.md#glos_ibdata_file), [index](glossary.md#glos_index), [system tablespace](glossary.md#glos_system_tablespace), [table](glossary.md#glos_table), [tablespace](glossary.md#glos_tablespace).

data manipulation language
:   See [DML](glossary.md#glos_dml).

data warehouse
:   A database system or application that primarily runs large
    **queries**. The read-only or
    read-mostly data might be organized in
    **denormalized** form for query
    efficiency. Can benefit from the optimizations for
    **read-only transactions** in MySQL
    5.6 and higher. Contrast with
    **OLTP**.

    See Also [denormalized](glossary.md#glos_denormalized), [OLTP](glossary.md#glos_oltp), [query](glossary.md#glos_query), [read-only transaction](glossary.md#glos_read_only_transaction).

database
:   Within the MySQL **data
    directory**, each database is represented by a separate
    directory. The InnoDB **system
    tablespace**, which can hold table data from multiple
    databases within a MySQL
    **instance**, is kept in
    **data files** that reside outside
    of individual database directories. When
    **file-per-table** mode is enabled,
    the **.ibd files** representing
    individual InnoDB tables are stored inside the database
    directories unless created elsewhere using the `DATA
    DIRECTORY` clause. General tablespaces, introduced in
    MySQL 5.7.6, also hold table data in **.ibd
    files**. Unlike file-per-table
    **.ibd files**, general tablespace
    **.ibd files** can hold table data
    from multiple databases within a MySQL
    **instance**, and can be assigned
    to directories relative to or independent of the MySQL data
    directory.

    For long-time MySQL users, a database is a familiar notion.
    Users coming from an Oracle Database background may find that
    the MySQL meaning of a database is closer to what Oracle
    Database calls a **schema**.

    See Also [data files](glossary.md#glos_data_files), [file-per-table](glossary.md#glos_file_per_table), [.ibd file](glossary.md#glos_ibd_file), [instance](glossary.md#glos_instance), [schema](glossary.md#glos_schema), [system tablespace](glossary.md#glos_system_tablespace).

DCL
:   Data control language, a set of
    **SQL** statements for managing
    privileges. In MySQL, consists of the
    [`GRANT`](grant.md "15.7.1.6 GRANT Statement") and
    [`REVOKE`](revoke.md "15.7.1.8 REVOKE Statement") statements. Contrast with
    **DDL** and
    **DML**.

    See Also [DDL](glossary.md#glos_ddl), [DML](glossary.md#glos_dml), [SQL](glossary.md#glos_sql).

DDEX provider
:   A feature that lets you use the data design tools within
    **Visual Studio** to manipulate the
    schema and objects within a MySQL database. For MySQL
    applications using **Connector/NET**, the
    MySQL Visual Studio Plugin acts as a DDEX provider with MySQL
    5.0 and later.

    See Also [Visual Studio](glossary.md#glos_visual_studio).

DDL
:   Data definition language, a set of
    **SQL** statements for manipulating
    the database itself rather than individual table rows. Includes
    all forms of the `CREATE`,
    `ALTER`, and `DROP`
    statements. Also includes the `TRUNCATE`
    statement, because it works differently than a `DELETE
    FROM table_name` statement,
    even though the ultimate effect is similar.

    DDL statements automatically
    **commit** the current
    **transaction**; they cannot be
    **rolled back**.

    The `InnoDB`
    [online DDL](glossary.md#glos_online_ddl "online DDL") feature
    enhances performance for [`CREATE
    INDEX`](create-index.md "15.1.15 CREATE INDEX Statement"), [`DROP INDEX`](drop-index.md "15.1.27 DROP INDEX Statement"), and
    many types of [`ALTER TABLE`](alter-table.md "15.1.9 ALTER TABLE Statement")
    operations. See [Section 17.12, “InnoDB and Online DDL”](innodb-online-ddl.md "17.12 InnoDB and Online DDL") for more
    information. Also, the `InnoDB`
    [file-per-table](glossary.md#glos_file_per_table "file-per-table")
    setting can affect the behavior of [`DROP
    TABLE`](drop-table.md "15.1.32 DROP TABLE Statement") and [`TRUNCATE
    TABLE`](truncate-table.md "15.1.37 TRUNCATE TABLE Statement") operations.

    Contrast with **DML** and
    **DCL**.

    See Also [commit](glossary.md#glos_commit), [DCL](glossary.md#glos_dcl), [DML](glossary.md#glos_dml), [file-per-table](glossary.md#glos_file_per_table), [rollback](glossary.md#glos_rollback), [SQL](glossary.md#glos_sql), [transaction](glossary.md#glos_transaction).

deadlock
:   A situation where different
    **transactions** are unable to
    proceed, because each holds a
    **lock** that the other needs.
    Because both transactions are waiting for a resource to become
    available, neither one ever releases the locks it holds.

    A deadlock can occur when the transactions lock rows in multiple
    tables (through statements such as `UPDATE` or
    `SELECT ... FOR UPDATE`), but in the opposite
    order. A deadlock can also occur when such statements lock
    ranges of index records and
    **gaps**, with each transaction
    acquiring some locks but not others due to a timing issue.

    For background information on how deadlocks are automatically
    detected and handled, see
    [Section 17.7.5.2, “Deadlock Detection”](innodb-deadlock-detection.md "17.7.5.2 Deadlock Detection"). For tips on
    avoiding and recovering from deadlock conditions, see
    [Section 17.7.5.3, “How to Minimize and Handle Deadlocks”](innodb-deadlocks-handling.md "17.7.5.3 How to Minimize and Handle Deadlocks").

    See Also [gap](glossary.md#glos_gap), [lock](glossary.md#glos_lock), [transaction](glossary.md#glos_transaction).

deadlock detection
:   A mechanism that automatically detects when a
    **deadlock** occurs, and
    automatically **rolls back** one of
    the **transactions** involved (the
    **victim**). Deadlock detection can
    be disabled using the
    [`innodb_deadlock_detect`](innodb-parameters.md#sysvar_innodb_deadlock_detect)
    configuration option.

    See Also [deadlock](glossary.md#glos_deadlock), [rollback](glossary.md#glos_rollback), [transaction](glossary.md#glos_transaction), [victim](glossary.md#glos_victim).

delete
:   When `InnoDB` processes a
    `DELETE` statement, the rows are immediately
    marked for deletion and no longer are returned by queries. The
    storage is reclaimed sometime later, during the periodic garbage
    collection known as the **purge**
    operation. For removing large quantities of data, related
    operations with their own performance characteristics are
    **TRUNCATE** and
    **DROP**.

    See Also [drop](glossary.md#glos_drop), [purge](glossary.md#glos_purge), [truncate](glossary.md#glos_truncate).

delete buffering
:   The technique of storing changes to secondary index pages,
    resulting from `DELETE` operations, in the
    **change buffer** rather than
    writing the changes immediately, so that the physical writes can
    be performed to minimize random I/O. (Because delete operations
    are a two-step process, this operation buffers the write that
    normally marks an index record for deletion.) It is one of the
    types of **change buffering**; the
    others are **insert buffering** and
    **purge buffering**.

    See Also [change buffer](glossary.md#glos_change_buffer), [change buffering](glossary.md#glos_change_buffering), [insert buffer](glossary.md#glos_insert_buffer), [insert buffering](glossary.md#glos_insert_buffering), [purge buffering](glossary.md#glos_purge_buffering).

denormalized
:   A data storage strategy that duplicates data across different
    tables, rather than linking the tables with
    **foreign keys** and
    **join** queries. Typically used in
    **data warehouse** applications,
    where the data is not updated after loading. In such
    applications, query performance is more important than making it
    simple to maintain consistent data during updates. Contrast with
    **normalized**.

    See Also [data warehouse](glossary.md#glos_data_warehouse), [foreign key](glossary.md#glos_foreign_key), [join](glossary.md#glos_join), [normalized](glossary.md#glos_normalized).

descending index
:   A type of **index** where index
    storage is optimized to process `ORDER BY
    column DESC` clauses.

    See Also [index](glossary.md#glos_index).

dictionary object cache
:   The dictionary object cache stores previously accessed
    **data dictionary** objects in
    memory to enable object reuse and minimize disk I/O. An
    **LRU**-based eviction strategy is
    used to evict least recently used objects from memory. The cache
    is comprised of several partitions that store different object
    types.

    For more information, see
    [Section 16.4, “Dictionary Object Cache”](data-dictionary-object-cache.md "16.4 Dictionary Object Cache").

    See Also [data dictionary](glossary.md#glos_data_dictionary), [LRU](glossary.md#glos_lru).

dirty page
:   A **page** in the
    `InnoDB` **buffer
    pool** that has been updated in memory, where the
    changes are not yet written
    (**flushed**) to the
    **data files**. The opposite of a
    **clean page**.

    See Also [buffer pool](glossary.md#glos_buffer_pool), [clean page](glossary.md#glos_clean_page), [data files](glossary.md#glos_data_files), [flush](glossary.md#glos_flush), [page](glossary.md#glos_page).

dirty read
:   An operation that retrieves unreliable data, data that was
    updated by another transaction but not yet
    **committed**. It is only possible
    with the **isolation level** known
    as **read uncommitted**.

    This kind of operation does not adhere to the
    **ACID** principle of database
    design. It is considered very risky, because the data could be
    **rolled back**, or updated further
    before being committed; then, the transaction doing the dirty
    read would be using data that was never confirmed as accurate.

    Its opposite is **consistent
    read**, where `InnoDB` ensures that a
    transaction does not read information updated by another
    transaction, even if the other transaction commits in the
    meantime.

    See Also [ACID](glossary.md#glos_acid), [commit](glossary.md#glos_commit), [consistent read](glossary.md#glos_consistent_read), [isolation level](glossary.md#glos_isolation_level), [READ UNCOMMITTED](glossary.md#glos_read_uncommitted), [rollback](glossary.md#glos_rollback).

disk-based
:   A kind of database that primarily organizes data on disk storage
    (hard drives or equivalent). Data is brought back and forth
    between disk and memory to be operated upon. It is the opposite
    of an **in-memory database**.
    Although `InnoDB` is disk-based, it also
    contains features such as he **buffer
    pool**, multiple buffer pool instances, and the
    **adaptive hash index** that allow
    certain kinds of workloads to work primarily from memory.

    See Also [adaptive hash index](glossary.md#glos_adaptive_hash_index), [buffer pool](glossary.md#glos_buffer_pool), [in-memory database](glossary.md#glos_in_memory_database).

disk-bound
:   A type of **workload** where the
    primary **bottleneck** is disk I/O.
    (Also known as **I/O-bound**.)
    Typically involves frequent writes to disk, or random reads of
    more data than can fit into the **buffer
    pool**.

    See Also [bottleneck](glossary.md#glos_bottleneck), [buffer pool](glossary.md#glos_buffer_pool), [workload](glossary.md#glos_workload).

DML
:   Data manipulation language, a set of
    **SQL** statements for performing
    [`INSERT`](insert.md "15.2.7 INSERT Statement"),
    [`UPDATE`](update.md "15.2.17 UPDATE Statement"), and
    [`DELETE`](delete.md "15.2.2 DELETE Statement") operations. The
    [`SELECT`](select.md "15.2.13 SELECT Statement") statement is sometimes
    considered as a DML statement, because the `SELECT ...
    FOR UPDATE` form is subject to the same considerations
    for **locking** as
    [`INSERT`](insert.md "15.2.7 INSERT Statement"),
    [`UPDATE`](update.md "15.2.17 UPDATE Statement"), and
    [`DELETE`](delete.md "15.2.2 DELETE Statement").

    DML statements for an `InnoDB` table operate in
    the context of a **transaction**,
    so their effects can be
    **committed** or
    **rolled back** as a single unit.

    Contrast with **DDL** and
    **DCL**.

    See Also [commit](glossary.md#glos_commit), [DCL](glossary.md#glos_dcl), [DDL](glossary.md#glos_ddl), [locking](glossary.md#glos_locking), [rollback](glossary.md#glos_rollback), [SQL](glossary.md#glos_sql), [transaction](glossary.md#glos_transaction).

document id
:   In the `InnoDB` **full-text
    search** feature, a special column in the table
    containing the **FULLTEXT index**,
    to uniquely identify the document associated with each
    **ilist** value. Its name is
    `FTS_DOC_ID` (uppercase required). The column
    itself must be of `BIGINT UNSIGNED NOT NULL`
    type, with a unique index named
    `FTS_DOC_ID_INDEX`. Preferably, you define this
    column when creating the table. If `InnoDB`
    must add the column to the table while creating a
    `FULLTEXT` index, the indexing operation is
    considerably more expensive.

    See Also [full-text search](glossary.md#glos_full_text_search), [FULLTEXT index](glossary.md#glos_fulltext_index), [ilist](glossary.md#glos_ilist).

doublewrite buffer
:   `InnoDB` uses a file flush technique called
    doublewrite. Before writing
    **pages** to the
    **data files**,
    `InnoDB` first writes them to a storage area
    called the doublewrite buffer. Only after the write and the
    flush to the doublewrite buffer have completed, does
    `InnoDB` write the pages to their proper
    positions in the data file. If there is an operating system,
    storage subsystem or [**mysqld**](mysqld.md "6.3.1 mysqld — The MySQL Server") process crash in
    the middle of a page write, `InnoDB` can find a
    good copy of the page from the doublewrite buffer during
    **crash recovery**.

    Although data is always written twice, the doublewrite buffer
    does not require twice as much I/O overhead or twice as many I/O
    operations. Data is written to the buffer itself as a large
    sequential chunk, with a single `fsync()` call
    to the operating system.

    See Also [crash recovery](glossary.md#glos_crash_recovery), [data files](glossary.md#glos_data_files), [page](glossary.md#glos_page), [purge](glossary.md#glos_purge).

drop
:   A kind of **DDL** operation that
    removes a schema object, through a statement such as
    [`DROP TABLE`](drop-table.md "15.1.32 DROP TABLE Statement") or
    [`DROP INDEX`](drop-index.md "15.1.27 DROP INDEX Statement"). It maps internally to
    an [`ALTER TABLE`](alter-table.md "15.1.9 ALTER TABLE Statement") statement. From an
    `InnoDB` perspective, the performance
    considerations of such operations involve the time that the
    **data dictionary** is locked to
    ensure that interrelated objects are all updated, and the time
    to update memory structures such as the
    **buffer pool**. For a
    **table**, the drop operation has
    somewhat different characteristics than a
    **truncate** operation
    ([`TRUNCATE TABLE`](truncate-table.md "15.1.37 TRUNCATE TABLE Statement") statement).

    See Also [buffer pool](glossary.md#glos_buffer_pool), [data dictionary](glossary.md#glos_data_dictionary), [DDL](glossary.md#glos_ddl), [table](glossary.md#glos_table), [truncate](glossary.md#glos_truncate).

DSN
:   Acronym for “Database Source Name”. It is the
    encoding for **connection**
    information within
    **Connector/ODBC**. See
    [Configuring a Connector/ODBC DSN on Windows](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/connector-odbc/en/connector-odbc-configuration-dsn-windows.html) for
    full details. It is the equivalent of the
    **connection string** used by
    **Connector/NET**.

    See Also [connection](glossary.md#glos_connection), [connection string](glossary.md#glos_connection_string), [Connector/NET](glossary.md#glos_connector_net), [Connector/ODBC](glossary.md#glos_connector_odbc).

dynamic cursor
:   A type of **cursor** supported by
    **ODBC** that can pick up new and
    changed results when the rows are read again. Whether and how
    quickly the changes are visible to the cursor depends on the
    type of table involved (transactional or non-transactional) and
    the isolation level for transactional tables. Support for
    dynamic cursors must be explicitly enabled.

    See Also [cursor](glossary.md#glos_cursor), [ODBC](glossary.md#glos_odbc).

dynamic row format
:   An `InnoDB` row format. Because long
    variable-length column values are stored outside of the page
    that holds the row data, it is very efficient for rows that
    include large objects. Since the large fields are typically not
    accessed to evaluate query conditions, they are not brought into
    the **buffer pool** as often,
    resulting in fewer I/O operations and better utilization of
    cache memory.

    As of MySQL 5.7.9, the default row format is defined by
    [`innodb_default_row_format`](innodb-parameters.md#sysvar_innodb_default_row_format),
    which has a default value of `DYNAMIC`.

    For additional information about `InnoDB`
    `DYNAMIC` row format, see
    [DYNAMIC Row Format](innodb-row-format.md#innodb-row-format-dynamic "DYNAMIC Row Format").

    See Also [buffer pool](glossary.md#glos_buffer_pool), [file format](glossary.md#glos_file_format), [row format](glossary.md#glos_row_format).

dynamic SQL
:   A feature that lets you create and execute
    **prepared statements** using more
    robust, secure, and efficient methods to substitute parameter
    values than the naive technique of concatenating the parts of
    the statement into a string variable.

    See Also [prepared statement](glossary.md#glos_prepared_statement).

dynamic statement
:   A **prepared statement** created
    and executed through **dynamic
    SQL**.

    See Also [dynamic SQL](glossary.md#glos_dynamic_sql), [prepared statement](glossary.md#glos_prepared_statement).

### E

early adopter
:   A stage similar to **beta**, when a
    software product is typically evaluated for performance,
    functionality, and compatibility in a non-mission-critical
    setting.

    See Also [beta](glossary.md#glos_beta).

Eiffel
:   A programming language including many object-oriented features.
    Some of its concepts are familiar to
    **Java** and
    **C#** developers. For the
    open-source Eiffel **API** for
    MySQL, see [Section 31.13, “MySQL Eiffel Wrapper”](apis-eiffel.md "31.13 MySQL Eiffel Wrapper").

    See Also [API](glossary.md#glos_api), [C#](glossary.md#glos_csharp), [Java](glossary.md#glos_java).

embedded
:   The embedded MySQL server library
    (**libmysqld**) makes it possible
    to run a full-featured MySQL server inside a
    **client** application. The main
    benefits are increased speed and more simple management for
    embedded applications.

    See Also [client](glossary.md#glos_client), [libmysqld](glossary.md#glos_libmysqld).

error log
:   A type of **log** showing
    information about MySQL startup and critical runtime errors and
    **crash** information. For details,
    see [Section 7.4.2, “The Error Log”](error-log.md "7.4.2 The Error Log").

    See Also [crash](glossary.md#glos_crash), [log](glossary.md#glos_log).

eviction
:   The process of removing an item from a cache or other temporary
    storage area, such as the `InnoDB`
    **buffer pool**. Often, but not
    always, uses the **LRU** algorithm
    to determine which item to remove. When a
    **dirty page** is evicted, its
    contents are **flushed** to disk,
    and any dirty **neighbor pages**
    might be flushed also.

    See Also [buffer pool](glossary.md#glos_buffer_pool), [dirty page](glossary.md#glos_dirty_page), [flush](glossary.md#glos_flush), [LRU](glossary.md#glos_lru), [neighbor page](glossary.md#glos_neighbor_page).

exception interceptor
:   A type of **interceptor** for
    tracing, debugging, or augmenting SQL errors encountered by a
    database application. For example, the interceptor code could
    issue a `SHOW WARNINGS` statement to retrieve
    additional information, and add descriptive text or even change
    the type of the exception returned to the application. Because
    the interceptor code is only called when SQL statements return
    errors, it does not impose any performance penalty on the
    application during normal (error-free) operation.

    In **Java** applications using
    **Connector/J**, setting up this
    type of interceptor involves implementing the
    `com.mysql.jdbc.ExceptionInterceptor`
    interface, and adding a `exceptionInterceptors`
    property to the **connection
    string**.

    In **Visual Studio** applications
    using **Connector/NET**, setting up this
    type of interceptor involves defining a class that inherits from
    the `BaseExceptionInterceptor` class and
    specifying that class name as part of the connection string.

    See Also [Connector/J](glossary.md#glos_connector_j), [Connector/NET](glossary.md#glos_connector_net), [interceptor](glossary.md#glos_interceptor), [Java](glossary.md#glos_java), [Visual Studio](glossary.md#glos_visual_studio).

exclusive lock
:   A kind of **lock** that prevents
    any other **transaction** from
    locking the same row. Depending on the transaction
    **isolation level**, this kind of
    lock might block other transactions from writing to the same
    row, or might also block other transactions from reading the
    same row. The default `InnoDB` isolation level,
    **REPEATABLE READ**, enables higher
    **concurrency** by allowing
    transactions to read rows that have exclusive locks, a technique
    known as **consistent read**.

    See Also [concurrency](glossary.md#glos_concurrency), [consistent read](glossary.md#glos_consistent_read), [isolation level](glossary.md#glos_isolation_level), [lock](glossary.md#glos_lock), [REPEATABLE READ](glossary.md#glos_repeatable_read), [shared lock](glossary.md#glos_shared_lock), [transaction](glossary.md#glos_transaction).

extent
:   A group of **pages** within a
    **tablespace**. For the default
    **page size** of 16KB, an extent
    contains 64 pages. In MySQL 5.6, the page size for an
    `InnoDB` instance can be 4KB, 8KB, or 16KB,
    controlled by the
    [`innodb_page_size`](innodb-parameters.md#sysvar_innodb_page_size) configuration
    option. For 4KB, 8KB, and 16KB pages sizes, the extent size is
    always 1MB (or 1048576 bytes).

    Support for 32KB and 64KB `InnoDB` page sizes
    was added in MySQL 5.7.6. For a 32KB page size, the extent size
    is 2MB. For a 64KB page size, the extent size is 4MB.

    `InnoDB` features such as
    **segments**,
    **read-ahead** requests and the
    **doublewrite buffer** use I/O
    operations that read, write, allocate, or free data one extent
    at a time.

    See Also [doublewrite buffer](glossary.md#glos_doublewrite_buffer), [page](glossary.md#glos_page), [page size](glossary.md#glos_page_size), [read-ahead](glossary.md#glos_read_ahead), [segment](glossary.md#glos_segment), [tablespace](glossary.md#glos_tablespace).

### F

.frm file
:   A file containing the metadata, such as the table definition, of
    a MySQL table. `.frm` files were removed in
    MySQL 8.0 but are still used in earlier MySQL releases. In MySQL
    8.0, data previously stored in `.frm` files
    is stored in **data dictionary**
    tables.

    See Also [data dictionary](glossary.md#glos_data_dictionary), [MySQL Enterprise Backup](glossary.md#glos_mysql_enterprise_backup), [system tablespace](glossary.md#glos_system_tablespace).

failover
:   The ability to automatically switch to a standby server in the
    event of a failure. In the MySQL context, failover involves a
    standby database server. Often supported within
    **J2EE** environments by the
    application server or framework.

    See Also [Connector/J](glossary.md#glos_connector_j), [J2EE](glossary.md#glos_j2ee).

Fast Index Creation
:   A capability first introduced in the InnoDB Plugin, now part of
    MySQL in 5.5 and higher, that speeds up creation of
    `InnoDB` **secondary
    indexes** by avoiding the need to completely rewrite
    the associated table. The speedup applies to dropping secondary
    indexes also.

    Because index maintenance can add performance overhead to many
    data transfer operations, consider doing operations such as
    `ALTER TABLE ... ENGINE=INNODB` or
    `INSERT INTO ... SELECT * FROM ...` without any
    secondary indexes in place, and creating the indexes afterward.

    In MySQL 5.6, this feature becomes more general. You can read
    and write to tables while an index is being created, and many
    more kinds of [`ALTER TABLE`](alter-table.md "15.1.9 ALTER TABLE Statement")
    operations can be performed without copying the table, without
    blocking **DML** operations, or
    both. Thus in MySQL 5.6 and higher, this set of features is
    referred to as **online DDL**
    rather than Fast Index Creation.

    For related information, see
    [Section 17.12, “InnoDB and Online DDL”](innodb-online-ddl.md "17.12 InnoDB and Online DDL").

    See Also [DML](glossary.md#glos_dml), [index](glossary.md#glos_index), [online DDL](glossary.md#glos_online_ddl), [secondary index](glossary.md#glos_secondary_index).

fast shutdown
:   The default **shutdown** procedure
    for `InnoDB`, based on the configuration
    setting [`innodb_fast_shutdown=1`](innodb-parameters.md#sysvar_innodb_fast_shutdown).
    To save time, certain **flush**
    operations are skipped. This type of shutdown is safe during
    normal usage, because the flush operations are performed during
    the next startup, using the same mechanism as in
    **crash recovery**. In cases where
    the database is being shut down for an upgrade or downgrade, do
    a **slow shutdown** instead to
    ensure that all relevant changes are applied to the
    **data files** during the shutdown.

    See Also [crash recovery](glossary.md#glos_crash_recovery), [data files](glossary.md#glos_data_files), [flush](glossary.md#glos_flush), [shutdown](glossary.md#glos_shutdown), [slow shutdown](glossary.md#glos_slow_shutdown).

file format
:   The file format for `InnoDB` tables.

    See Also [file-per-table](glossary.md#glos_file_per_table), [.ibd file](glossary.md#glos_ibd_file), [ibdata file](glossary.md#glos_ibdata_file), [row format](glossary.md#glos_row_format).

file-per-table
:   A general name for the setting controlled by the
    [`innodb_file_per_table`](innodb-parameters.md#sysvar_innodb_file_per_table) option,
    which is an important configuration option that affects aspects
    of `InnoDB` file storage, availability of
    features, and I/O characteristics. As of MySQL 5.6.7,
    [`innodb_file_per_table`](innodb-parameters.md#sysvar_innodb_file_per_table) is
    enabled by default.

    With the [`innodb_file_per_table`](innodb-parameters.md#sysvar_innodb_file_per_table)
    option enabled, you can create a table in its own
    **.ibd file** rather than in the
    shared **ibdata files** of the
    **system tablespace**. When table
    data is stored in an individual **.ibd
    file**, you have more flexibility to choose
    **row formats** required for
    features such as data
    **compression**. The
    `TRUNCATE TABLE` operation is also faster, and
    reclaimed space can be used by the operating system rather than
    remaining reserved for `InnoDB`.

    The **MySQL Enterprise Backup** product is more
    flexible for tables that are in their own files. For example,
    tables can be excluded from a backup, but only if they are in
    separate files. Thus, this setting is suitable for tables that
    are backed up less frequently or on a different schedule.

    See Also [compressed row format](glossary.md#glos_compressed_row_format), [compression](glossary.md#glos_compression), [file format](glossary.md#glos_file_format), [.ibd file](glossary.md#glos_ibd_file), [ibdata file](glossary.md#glos_ibdata_file), [innodb\_file\_per\_table](glossary.md#glos_innodb_file_per_table), [MySQL Enterprise Backup](glossary.md#glos_mysql_enterprise_backup), [row format](glossary.md#glos_row_format), [system tablespace](glossary.md#glos_system_tablespace).

fill factor
:   In an `InnoDB`
    **index**, the proportion of a
    **page** that is taken up by index
    data before the page is split. The unused space when index data
    is first divided between pages allows for rows to be updated
    with longer string values without requiring expensive index
    maintenance operations. If the fill factor is too low, the index
    consumes more space than needed, causing extra I/O overhead when
    reading the index. If the fill factor is too high, any update
    that increases the length of column values can cause extra I/O
    overhead for index maintenance. See
    [Section 17.6.2.2, “The Physical Structure of an InnoDB Index”](innodb-physical-structure.md "17.6.2.2 The Physical Structure of an InnoDB Index") for more
    information.

    See Also [index](glossary.md#glos_index), [page](glossary.md#glos_page).

fixed row format
:   This row format is used by the `MyISAM` storage
    engine, not by `InnoDB`. If you create an
    `InnoDB` table with the option
    `ROW_FORMAT=FIXED` in MySQL 5.7.6 or earlier,
    `InnoDB` uses the **compact
    row format** instead, although the
    `FIXED` value might still show up in output
    such as `SHOW TABLE STATUS` reports. As of
    MySQL 5.7.7, `InnoDB` returns an error if
    `ROW_FORMAT=FIXED` is specified.

    See Also [compact row format](glossary.md#glos_compact_row_format), [row format](glossary.md#glos_row_format).

flush
:   To write changes to the database files, that had been buffered
    in a memory area or a temporary disk storage area. The
    `InnoDB` storage structures that are
    periodically flushed include the **redo
    log**, the **undo log**,
    and the **buffer pool**.

    Flushing can happen because a memory area becomes full and the
    system needs to free some space, because a
    **commit** operation means the
    changes from a transaction can be finalized, or because a
    **slow shutdown** operation means
    that all outstanding work should be finalized. When it is not
    critical to flush all the buffered data at once,
    `InnoDB` can use a technique called
    **fuzzy checkpointing** to flush
    small batches of pages to spread out the I/O overhead.

    See Also [buffer pool](glossary.md#glos_buffer_pool), [commit](glossary.md#glos_commit), [fuzzy checkpointing](glossary.md#glos_fuzzy_checkpointing), [redo log](glossary.md#glos_redo_log), [slow shutdown](glossary.md#glos_slow_shutdown), [undo log](glossary.md#glos_undo_log).

flush list
:   An internal `InnoDB` data structure that tracks
    **dirty pages** in the
    **buffer pool**: that is,
    **pages** that have been changed
    and need to be written back out to disk. This data structure is
    updated frequently by `InnoDB` internal
    **mini-transactions**, and so is
    protected by its own **mutex** to
    allow concurrent access to the buffer pool.

    See Also [buffer pool](glossary.md#glos_buffer_pool), [dirty page](glossary.md#glos_dirty_page), [LRU](glossary.md#glos_lru), [mini-transaction](glossary.md#glos_mini_transaction), [mutex](glossary.md#glos_mutex), [page](glossary.md#glos_page), [page cleaner](glossary.md#glos_page_cleaner).

foreign key
:   A type of pointer relationship, between rows in separate
    `InnoDB` tables. The foreign key relationship
    is defined on one column in both the
    **parent table** and the
    **child table**.

    In addition to enabling fast lookup of related information,
    foreign keys help to enforce **referential
    integrity**, by preventing any of these pointers from
    becoming invalid as data is inserted, updated, and deleted. This
    enforcement mechanism is a type of
    **constraint**. A row that points
    to another table cannot be inserted if the associated foreign
    key value does not exist in the other table. If a row is deleted
    or its foreign key value changed, and rows in another table
    point to that foreign key value, the foreign key can be set up
    to prevent the deletion, cause the corresponding column values
    in the other table to become
    **null**, or automatically delete
    the corresponding rows in the other table.

    One of the stages in designing a
    **normalized** database is to
    identify data that is duplicated, separate that data into a new
    table, and set up a foreign key relationship so that the
    multiple tables can be queried like a single table, using a
    **join** operation.

    See Also [child table](glossary.md#glos_child_table), [FOREIGN KEY constraint](glossary.md#glos_foreign_key_constraint), [join](glossary.md#glos_join), [normalized](glossary.md#glos_normalized), [NULL](glossary.md#glos_null), [parent table](glossary.md#glos_parent_table), [referential integrity](glossary.md#glos_referential_integrity), [relational](glossary.md#glos_relational).

FOREIGN KEY constraint
:   The type of **constraint** that
    maintains database consistency through a
    **foreign key** relationship. Like
    other kinds of constraints, it can prevent data from being
    inserted or updated if data would become inconsistent; in this
    case, the inconsistency being prevented is between data in
    multiple tables. Alternatively, when a
    **DML** operation is performed,
    `FOREIGN KEY` constraints can cause data in
    **child rows** to be deleted,
    changed to different values, or set to
    **null**, based on the `ON
    CASCADE` option specified when creating the foreign
    key.

    See Also [child table](glossary.md#glos_child_table), [constraint](glossary.md#glos_constraint), [DML](glossary.md#glos_dml), [foreign key](glossary.md#glos_foreign_key), [NULL](glossary.md#glos_null).

FTS
:   In most contexts, an acronym for **full-text
    search**. Sometimes in performance discussions, an
    acronym for **full table scan**.

    See Also [full table scan](glossary.md#glos_full_table_scan), [full-text search](glossary.md#glos_full_text_search).

full backup
:   A **backup** that includes all the
    **tables** in each MySQL
    **database**, and all the databases
    in a MySQL **instance**. Contrast
    with **partial backup**.

    See Also [backup](glossary.md#glos_backup), [database](glossary.md#glos_database), [instance](glossary.md#glos_instance), [partial backup](glossary.md#glos_partial_backup), [table](glossary.md#glos_table).

full table scan
:   An operation that requires reading the entire contents of a
    table, rather than just selected portions using an
    **index**. Typically performed
    either with small lookup tables, or in data warehousing
    situations with large tables where all available data is
    aggregated and analyzed. How frequently these operations occur,
    and the sizes of the tables relative to available memory, have
    implications for the algorithms used in query optimization and
    managing the **buffer pool**.

    The purpose of indexes is to allow lookups for specific values
    or ranges of values within a large table, thus avoiding full
    table scans when practical.

    See Also [buffer pool](glossary.md#glos_buffer_pool), [index](glossary.md#glos_index).

full-text search
:   The MySQL feature for finding words, phrases, Boolean
    combinations of words, and so on within table data, in a faster,
    more convenient, and more flexible way than using the SQL
    `LIKE` operator or writing your own
    application-level search algorithm. It uses the SQL function
    [`MATCH()`](fulltext-search.md#function_match) and
    **FULLTEXT indexes**.

    See Also [FULLTEXT index](glossary.md#glos_fulltext_index).

FULLTEXT index
:   The special kind of **index** that
    holds the **search index** in the
    MySQL **full-text search**
    mechanism. Represents the words from values of a column,
    omitting any that are specified as
    **stopwords**. Originally, only
    available for `MyISAM` tables. Starting in
    MySQL 5.6.4, it is also available for
    **InnoDB** tables.

    See Also [full-text search](glossary.md#glos_full_text_search), [index](glossary.md#glos_index), [InnoDB](glossary.md#glos_innodb), [search index](glossary.md#glos_search_index), [stopword](glossary.md#glos_stopword).

fuzzy checkpointing
:   A technique that **flushes** small
    batches of **dirty pages** from the
    **buffer pool**, rather than
    flushing all dirty pages at once which would disrupt database
    processing.

    See Also [buffer pool](glossary.md#glos_buffer_pool), [dirty page](glossary.md#glos_dirty_page), [flush](glossary.md#glos_flush).

### G

GA
:   “Generally available”, the stage when a software
    product leaves **beta** and is
    available for sale, official support, and production use.

    See Also [beta](glossary.md#glos_beta).

GAC
:   Acronym for “Global Assembly Cache”. A central area
    for storing libraries
    (**assemblies**) on a
    **.NET** system. Physically
    consists of nested folders, treated as a single virtual folder
    by the **.NET** CLR.

    See Also [.NET](glossary.md#glos__net), [assembly](glossary.md#glos_assembly).

gap
:   A place in an `InnoDB`
    **index** data structure where new
    values could be inserted. When you lock a set of rows with a
    statement such as `SELECT ... FOR UPDATE`,
    `InnoDB` can create locks that apply to the
    gaps as well as the actual values in the index. For example, if
    you select all values greater than 10 for update, a gap lock
    prevents another transaction from inserting a new value that is
    greater than 10. The **supremum
    record** and **infimum
    record** represent the gaps containing all values
    greater than or less than all the current index values.

    See Also [concurrency](glossary.md#glos_concurrency), [gap lock](glossary.md#glos_gap_lock), [index](glossary.md#glos_index), [infimum record](glossary.md#glos_infimum_record), [isolation level](glossary.md#glos_isolation_level), [supremum record](glossary.md#glos_supremum_record).

gap lock
:   A **lock** on a
    **gap** between index records, or a
    lock on the gap before the first or after the last index record.
    For example, `SELECT c1 FROM t WHERE c1 BETWEEN 10 and
    20 FOR UPDATE;` prevents other transactions from
    inserting a value of 15 into the column `t.c1`,
    whether or not there was already any such value in the column,
    because the gaps between all existing values in the range are
    locked. Contrast with **record
    lock** and **next-key
    lock**.

    Gap locks are part of the tradeoff between performance and
    **concurrency**, and are used in
    some transaction **isolation
    levels** and not others.

    See Also [gap](glossary.md#glos_gap), [infimum record](glossary.md#glos_infimum_record), [lock](glossary.md#glos_lock), [next-key lock](glossary.md#glos_next_key_lock), [record lock](glossary.md#glos_record_lock), [supremum record](glossary.md#glos_supremum_record).

general log
:   See [general query log](glossary.md#glos_general_query_log).

general query log
:   A type of **log** used for
    diagnosis and troubleshooting of SQL statements processed by the
    MySQL server. Can be stored in a file or in a database table.
    You must enable this feature through the
    [`general_log`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_general_log) configuration
    option to use it. You can disable it for a specific connection
    through the [`sql_log_off`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_sql_log_off)
    configuration option.

    Records a broader range of queries than the
    **slow query log**. Unlike the
    **binary log**, which is used for
    replication, the general query log contains
    [`SELECT`](select.md "15.2.13 SELECT Statement") statements and does not
    maintain strict ordering. For more information, see
    [Section 7.4.3, “The General Query Log”](query-log.md "7.4.3 The General Query Log").

    See Also [binary log](glossary.md#glos_binary_log), [log](glossary.md#glos_log), [slow query log](glossary.md#glos_slow_query_log).

general tablespace
:   A shared `InnoDB`
    **tablespace** created using
    [`CREATE TABLESPACE`](create-tablespace.md "15.1.21 CREATE TABLESPACE Statement") syntax. General
    tablespaces can be created outside of the MySQL data directory,
    are capable of holding multiple
    **tables**, and support tables of
    all row formats. General tablespaces were introduced in MySQL
    5.7.6.

    Tables are added to a general tablespace using
    [`CREATE TABLE
    tbl_name ... TABLESPACE [=]
    tablespace_name`](create-table.md "15.1.20 CREATE TABLE Statement") or
    [`ALTER TABLE
    tbl_name TABLESPACE [=]
    tablespace_name`](alter-table.md "15.1.9 ALTER TABLE Statement") syntax.

    Contrast with **system tablespace**
    and **file-per-table** tablespace.

    For more information, see [Section 17.6.3.3, “General Tablespaces”](general-tablespaces.md "17.6.3.3 General Tablespaces").

    See Also [file-per-table](glossary.md#glos_file_per_table), [system tablespace](glossary.md#glos_system_tablespace), [table](glossary.md#glos_table), [tablespace](glossary.md#glos_tablespace).

generated column
:   A column whose values are computed from an expression included
    in the column definition. A generated column can be
    **virtual** or
    **stored**.

    See Also [base column](glossary.md#glos_base_column), [stored generated column](glossary.md#glos_stored_generated_column), [virtual generated column](glossary.md#glos_virtual_generated_column).

generated stored column
:   See [stored generated column](glossary.md#glos_stored_generated_column).

generated virtual column
:   See [virtual generated column](glossary.md#glos_virtual_generated_column).

Glassfish
:   See Also [J2EE](glossary.md#glos_j2ee).

global temporary tablespace
:   A *temporary tablespace* that stores
    *rollback segments* for changes made to
    user-created temporary tables.

    See Also [temporary tablespace](glossary.md#glos_temporary_tablespace).

global transaction
:   A type of **transaction** involved
    in **XA** operations. It consists
    of several actions that are transactional in themselves, but
    that all must either complete successfully as a group, or all be
    rolled back as a group. In essence, this extends
    **ACID** properties “up a
    level” so that multiple ACID transactions can be executed
    in concert as components of a global operation that also has
    ACID properties.

    See Also [ACID](glossary.md#glos_acid), [transaction](glossary.md#glos_transaction), [XA](glossary.md#glos_xa).

group commit
:   An `InnoDB` optimization that performs some
    low-level I/O operations (log write) once for a set of
    **commit** operations, rather than
    flushing and syncing separately for each commit.

    See Also [binary log](glossary.md#glos_binary_log), [commit](glossary.md#glos_commit).

GUID
:   Acronym for “globally unique identifier”, an ID
    value that can be used to associate data across different
    databases, languages, operating systems, and so on. (As an
    alternative to using sequential integers, where the same values
    could appear in different tables, databases, and so on referring
    to different data.) Older MySQL versions represented it as
    `BINARY(16)`. Currently, it is represented as
    `CHAR(36)`. MySQL has a
    `UUID()` function that returns GUID values in
    character format, and a `UUID_SHORT()` function
    that returns GUID values in integer format. Because successive
    GUID values are not necessarily in ascending sort order, it is
    not an efficient value to use as a primary key for large InnoDB
    tables.

### H

hash index
:   A type of **index** intended for
    queries that use equality operators, rather than range operators
    such as greater-than or `BETWEEN`. It is
    available for [`MEMORY`](memory-storage-engine.md "18.3 The MEMORY Storage Engine") tables.
    Although hash indexes are the default for
    [`MEMORY`](memory-storage-engine.md "18.3 The MEMORY Storage Engine") tables for historic reasons,
    that storage engine also supports
    **B-tree** indexes, which are often
    a better choice for general-purpose queries.

    MySQL includes a variant of this index type, the
    **adaptive hash index**, that is
    constructed automatically for
    [`InnoDB`](innodb-storage-engine.md "Chapter 17 The InnoDB Storage Engine") tables if needed based on
    runtime conditions.

    See Also [adaptive hash index](glossary.md#glos_adaptive_hash_index), [B-tree](glossary.md#glos_b_tree), [index](glossary.md#glos_index), [InnoDB](glossary.md#glos_innodb).

HDD
:   Acronym for “hard disk drive”. Refers to storage
    media using spinning platters, usually when comparing and
    contrasting with **SSD**. Its
    performance characteristics can influence the throughput of a
    **disk-based** workload.

    See Also [disk-based](glossary.md#glos_disk_based), [SSD](glossary.md#glos_ssd).

heartbeat
:   A periodic message that is sent to indicate that a system is
    functioning properly. In a
    **replication** context, if the
    **source** stops sending such
    messages, one of the **replicas**
    can take its place. Similar techniques can be used between the
    servers in a cluster environment, to confirm that all of them
    are operating properly.

    See Also [replication](glossary.md#glos_replication), [source](glossary.md#glos_source).

high-water mark
:   A value representing an upper limit, either a hard limit that
    should not be exceeded at runtime, or a record of the maximum
    value that was actually reached. Contrast with
    **low-water mark**.

    See Also [low-water mark](glossary.md#glos_low_water_mark).

history list
:   A list of **transactions** with
    delete-marked records scheduled to be processed by the
    `InnoDB` **purge**
    operation. Recorded in the **undo
    log**. The length of the history list is reported by
    the command `SHOW ENGINE INNODB STATUS`. If the
    history list grows longer than the value of the
    [`innodb_max_purge_lag`](innodb-parameters.md#sysvar_innodb_max_purge_lag)
    configuration option, each **DML**
    operation is delayed slightly to allow the purge operation to
    finish **flushing** the deleted
    records.

    Also known as **purge lag**.

    See Also [DML](glossary.md#glos_dml), [flush](glossary.md#glos_flush), [purge](glossary.md#glos_purge), [purge lag](glossary.md#glos_purge_lag), [rollback segment](glossary.md#glos_rollback_segment), [transaction](glossary.md#glos_transaction), [undo log](glossary.md#glos_undo_log).

hole punching
:   Releasing empty blocks from a page. The
    `InnoDB` **transparent page
    compression** feature relies on hole punching support.
    For more information, see
    [Section 17.9.2, “InnoDB Page Compression”](innodb-page-compression.md "17.9.2 InnoDB Page Compression").

    See Also [sparse file](glossary.md#glos_sparse_file), [transparent page compression](glossary.md#glos_transparent_page_compression).

host
:   The network name of a database server, used to establish a
    **connection**. Often specified in
    conjunction with a **port**. In
    some contexts, the IP address `127.0.0.1` works
    better than the special name `localhost` for
    accessing a database on the same server as the application.

    See Also [connection](glossary.md#glos_connection), [localhost](glossary.md#glos_localhost), [port](glossary.md#glos_port).

hot
:   A condition where a row, table, or internal data structure is
    accessed so frequently, requiring some form of locking or mutual
    exclusion, that it results in a performance or scalability
    issue.

    Although “hot” typically indicates an undesirable
    condition, a **hot backup** is the
    preferred type of backup.

    See Also [hot backup](glossary.md#glos_hot_backup).

hot backup
:   A backup taken while the database is running and applications
    are reading and writing to it. The backup involves more than
    simply copying data files: it must include any data that was
    inserted or updated while the backup was in process; it must
    exclude any data that was deleted while the backup was in
    process; and it must ignore any changes that were not committed.

    The Oracle product that performs hot backups, of
    `InnoDB` tables especially but also tables from
    `MyISAM` and other storage engines, is known as
    **MySQL Enterprise Backup**.

    The hot backup process consists of two stages. The initial
    copying of the data files produces a **raw
    backup**. The **apply**
    step incorporates any changes to the database that happened
    while the backup was running. Applying the changes produces a
    **prepared** backup; these files
    are ready to be restored whenever necessary.

    See Also [apply](glossary.md#glos_apply), [MySQL Enterprise Backup](glossary.md#glos_mysql_enterprise_backup), [prepared backup](glossary.md#glos_prepared_backup), [raw backup](glossary.md#glos_raw_backup).

### I

.ibd file
:   The data file for
    **file-per-table** tablespaces and
    general tablespaces. File-per-table tablespace
    `.ibd` files contain a single table and
    associated index data. **General
    tablespace** `.ibd` files may contain
    table and index data for multiple tables.

    The `.ibd` file extension does not apply to the
    **system tablespace**, which
    consists of one or more **ibdata
    files**.

    If a file-per-table tablespace or general tablespace is created
    with the `DATA DIRECTORY =` clause, the
    `.ibd` file is located at the specified path,
    outside the normal data directory.

    When a `.ibd` file is included in a compressed
    backup by the **MySQL Enterprise Backup** product,
    the compressed equivalent is a `.ibz` file.

    See Also [database](glossary.md#glos_database), [file-per-table](glossary.md#glos_file_per_table), [general tablespace](glossary.md#glos_general_tablespace), [ibdata file](glossary.md#glos_ibdata_file), [.ibz file](glossary.md#glos_ibz_file), [innodb\_file\_per\_table](glossary.md#glos_innodb_file_per_table), [MySQL Enterprise Backup](glossary.md#glos_mysql_enterprise_backup), [system tablespace](glossary.md#glos_system_tablespace).

.ibz file
:   When the **MySQL Enterprise Backup** product performs
    a **compressed backup**, it
    transforms each **tablespace** file
    that is created using the
    **file-per-table** setting from a
    `.ibd` extension to a `.ibz`
    extension.

    The compression applied during backup is distinct from the
    **compressed row format** that
    keeps table data compressed during normal operation. A
    compressed backup operation skips the compression step for a
    tablespace that is already in compressed row format, as
    compressing a second time would slow down the backup but produce
    little or no space savings.

    See Also [compressed backup](glossary.md#glos_compressed_backup), [compressed row format](glossary.md#glos_compressed_row_format), [file-per-table](glossary.md#glos_file_per_table), [.ibd file](glossary.md#glos_ibd_file), [MySQL Enterprise Backup](glossary.md#glos_mysql_enterprise_backup), [tablespace](glossary.md#glos_tablespace).

I/O-bound
:   See [disk-bound](glossary.md#glos_disk_bound).

ib-file set
:   The set of files managed by `InnoDB` within a
    MySQL database: the **system
    tablespace**,
    **file-per-table** tablespace
    files, and **redo log** files.
    Depending on MySQL version and `InnoDB`
    configuration, may also include **general
    tablespace**, **temporary
    tablespace**, and **undo
    tablespace** files. This term is sometimes used in
    detailed discussions of `InnoDB` file
    structures and formats to refer to the set of files managed by
    `InnoDB` within a MySQL database.

    See Also [database](glossary.md#glos_database), [file-per-table](glossary.md#glos_file_per_table), [general tablespace](glossary.md#glos_general_tablespace), [redo log](glossary.md#glos_redo_log), [system tablespace](glossary.md#glos_system_tablespace), [temporary tablespace](glossary.md#glos_temporary_tablespace), [undo tablespace](glossary.md#glos_undo_tablespace).

ibbackup\_logfile
:   A supplemental backup file created by the
    **MySQL Enterprise Backup** product during a
    **hot backup** operation. It
    contains information about any data changes that occurred while
    the backup was running. The initial backup files, including
    `ibbackup_logfile`, are known as a
    **raw backup**, because the changes
    that occurred during the backup operation are not yet
    incorporated. After you perform the
    **apply** step to the raw backup
    files, the resulting files do include those final data changes,
    and are known as a **prepared
    backup**. At this stage, the
    `ibbackup_logfile` file is no longer necessary.

    See Also [apply](glossary.md#glos_apply), [hot backup](glossary.md#glos_hot_backup), [MySQL Enterprise Backup](glossary.md#glos_mysql_enterprise_backup), [prepared backup](glossary.md#glos_prepared_backup), [raw backup](glossary.md#glos_raw_backup).

ibdata file
:   A set of files with names such as `ibdata1`,
    `ibdata2`, and so on, that make up the
    `InnoDB` **system
    tablespace**. For information about the structures and
    data that reside in the system tablespace
    `ibdata` files, see
    [Section 17.6.3.1, “The System Tablespace”](innodb-system-tablespace.md "17.6.3.1 The System Tablespace").

    Growth of the `ibdata` files is influenced by
    the [`innodb_autoextend_increment`](innodb-parameters.md#sysvar_innodb_autoextend_increment)
    configuration option.

    See Also [change buffer](glossary.md#glos_change_buffer), [data dictionary](glossary.md#glos_data_dictionary), [doublewrite buffer](glossary.md#glos_doublewrite_buffer), [file-per-table](glossary.md#glos_file_per_table), [.ibd file](glossary.md#glos_ibd_file), [innodb\_file\_per\_table](glossary.md#glos_innodb_file_per_table), [system tablespace](glossary.md#glos_system_tablespace), [undo log](glossary.md#glos_undo_log).

ibtmp file
:   The `InnoDB` **temporary
    tablespace** **data file**
    for non-compressed `InnoDB`
    **temporary tables** and related
    objects. The configuration file option,
    [`innodb_temp_data_file_path`](innodb-parameters.md#sysvar_innodb_temp_data_file_path),
    allows users to define a relative path for the temporary
    tablespace data file. If
    [`innodb_temp_data_file_path`](innodb-parameters.md#sysvar_innodb_temp_data_file_path) is
    not specified, the default behavior is to create a single
    auto-extending 12MB data file named `ibtmp1`
    in the data directory, alongside `ibdata1`.

    See Also [data files](glossary.md#glos_data_files), [temporary table](glossary.md#glos_temporary_table), [temporary tablespace](glossary.md#glos_temporary_tablespace).

ib\_logfile
:   A set of files, typically named `ib_logfile0`
    and `ib_logfile1`, that form the
    **redo log**. Also sometimes
    referred to as the **log group**.
    These files record statements that attempt to change data in
    `InnoDB` tables. These statements are replayed
    automatically to correct data written by incomplete
    transactions, on startup following a crash.

    This data cannot be used for manual recovery; for that type of
    operation, use the **binary log**.

    See Also [binary log](glossary.md#glos_binary_log), [log group](glossary.md#glos_log_group), [redo log](glossary.md#glos_redo_log).

ilist
:   Within an `InnoDB`
    **FULLTEXT index**, the data
    structure consisting of a document ID and positional information
    for a token (that is, a particular word).

    See Also [FULLTEXT index](glossary.md#glos_fulltext_index).

implicit row lock
:   A row lock that `InnoDB` acquires to ensure
    consistency, without you specifically requesting it.

    See Also [row lock](glossary.md#glos_row_lock).

in-memory database
:   A type of database system that maintains data in memory, to
    avoid overhead due to disk I/O and translation between disk
    blocks and memory areas. Some in-memory databases sacrifice
    durability (the “D” in the
    **ACID** design philosophy) and are
    vulnerable to hardware, power, and other types of failures,
    making them more suitable for read-only operations. Other
    in-memory databases do use durability mechanisms such as logging
    changes to disk or using non-volatile memory.

    MySQL features that address the same kinds of memory-intensive
    processing include the `InnoDB`
    **buffer pool**,
    **adaptive hash index**, and
    **read-only transaction**
    optimization, the [`MEMORY`](memory-storage-engine.md "18.3 The MEMORY Storage Engine") storage
    engine, the `MyISAM` key cache, and the MySQL
    query cache.

    See Also [ACID](glossary.md#glos_acid), [adaptive hash index](glossary.md#glos_adaptive_hash_index), [buffer pool](glossary.md#glos_buffer_pool), [disk-based](glossary.md#glos_disk_based), [read-only transaction](glossary.md#glos_read_only_transaction).

incremental backup
:   A type of **hot backup**, performed
    by the **MySQL Enterprise Backup** product, that only
    saves data changed since some point in time. Having a full
    backup and a succession of incremental backups lets you
    reconstruct backup data over a long period, without the storage
    overhead of keeping several full backups on hand. You can
    restore the full backup and then apply each of the incremental
    backups in succession, or you can keep the full backup
    up-to-date by applying each incremental backup to it, then
    perform a single restore operation.

    The granularity of changed data is at the
    **page** level. A page might
    actually cover more than one row. Each changed page is included
    in the backup.

    See Also [hot backup](glossary.md#glos_hot_backup), [MySQL Enterprise Backup](glossary.md#glos_mysql_enterprise_backup), [page](glossary.md#glos_page).

index
:   A data structure that provides a fast lookup capability for
    **rows** of a
    **table**, typically by forming a
    tree structure (**B-tree)**
    representing all the values of a particular
    **column** or set of columns.

    `InnoDB` tables always have a
    **clustered index** representing
    the **primary key**. They can also
    have one or more **secondary
    indexes** defined on one or more columns. Depending on
    their structure, secondary indexes can be classified as
    **partial**,
    **column**, or
    **composite** indexes.

    Indexes are a crucial aspect of
    **query** performance. Database
    architects design tables, queries, and indexes to allow fast
    lookups for data needed by applications. The ideal database
    design uses a **covering index**
    where practical; the query results are computed entirely from
    the index, without reading the actual table data. Each
    **foreign key** constraint also
    requires an index, to efficiently check whether values exist in
    both the **parent** and
    **child** tables.

    Although a B-tree index is the most common, a different kind of
    data structure is used for **hash
    indexes**, as in the `MEMORY` storage
    engine and the `InnoDB`
    **adaptive hash index**.
    **R-tree** indexes are used for
    spatial indexing of multi-dimensional information.

    See Also [adaptive hash index](glossary.md#glos_adaptive_hash_index), [B-tree](glossary.md#glos_b_tree), [child table](glossary.md#glos_child_table), [clustered index](glossary.md#glos_clustered_index), [column index](glossary.md#glos_column_index), [composite index](glossary.md#glos_composite_index), [covering index](glossary.md#glos_covering_index), [foreign key](glossary.md#glos_foreign_key), [hash index](glossary.md#glos_hash_index), [parent table](glossary.md#glos_parent_table), [partial index](glossary.md#glos_partial_index), [primary key](glossary.md#glos_primary_key), [query](glossary.md#glos_query), [R-tree](glossary.md#glos_r_tree), [row](glossary.md#glos_row), [secondary index](glossary.md#glos_secondary_index), [table](glossary.md#glos_table).

index cache
:   A memory area that holds the token data for
    `InnoDB` **full-text
    search**. It buffers the data to minimize disk I/O when
    data is inserted or updated in columns that are part of a
    **FULLTEXT index**. The token data
    is written to disk when the index cache becomes full. Each
    `InnoDB` `FULLTEXT` index has
    its own separate index cache, whose size is controlled by the
    configuration option
    [`innodb_ft_cache_size`](innodb-parameters.md#sysvar_innodb_ft_cache_size).

    See Also [full-text search](glossary.md#glos_full_text_search), [FULLTEXT index](glossary.md#glos_fulltext_index).

index condition pushdown
:   Index condition pushdown (ICP) is an optimization that pushes
    part of a `WHERE` condition down to the storage
    engine if parts of the condition can be evaluated using fields
    from the **index**. ICP can reduce
    the number of times the **storage
    engine** must access the base table and the number of
    times the MySQL server must access the storage engine. For more
    information, see
    [Section 10.2.1.6, “Index Condition Pushdown Optimization”](index-condition-pushdown-optimization.md "10.2.1.6 Index Condition Pushdown Optimization").

    See Also [index](glossary.md#glos_index), [storage engine](glossary.md#glos_storage_engine).

index hint
:   Extended SQL syntax for overriding the
    **indexes** recommended by the
    optimizer. For example, the `FORCE INDEX`,
    `USE INDEX`, and `IGNORE
    INDEX` clauses. Typically used when indexed columns
    have unevenly distributed values, resulting in inaccurate
    **cardinality** estimates.

    See Also [cardinality](glossary.md#glos_cardinality), [index](glossary.md#glos_index).

index prefix
:   In an **index** that applies to
    multiple columns (known as a **composite
    index**), the initial or leading columns of the index.
    A query that references the first 1, 2, 3, and so on columns of
    a composite index can use the index, even if the query does not
    reference all the columns in the index.

    See Also [composite index](glossary.md#glos_composite_index), [index](glossary.md#glos_index).

index statistics
:   See [statistics](glossary.md#glos_statistics).

infimum record
:   A **pseudo-record** in an
    **index**, representing the
    **gap** below the smallest value in
    that index. If a transaction has a statement such as
    `SELECT ... FROM ... WHERE col < 10 FOR
    UPDATE;`, and the smallest value in the column is 5, it
    is a lock on the infimum record that prevents other transactions
    from inserting even smaller values such as 0, -10, and so on.

    See Also [gap](glossary.md#glos_gap), [index](glossary.md#glos_index), [pseudo-record](glossary.md#glos_pseudo_record), [supremum record](glossary.md#glos_supremum_record).

INFORMATION\_SCHEMA
:   The name of the **database** that
    provides a query interface to the MySQL
    **data dictionary**. (This name is
    defined by the ANSI SQL standard.) To examine information
    (metadata) about the database, you can query tables such as
    `INFORMATION_SCHEMA.TABLES` and
    `INFORMATION_SCHEMA.COLUMNS`, rather than using
    `SHOW` commands that produce unstructured
    output.

    The `INFORMATION_SCHEMA` database also contains
    tables specific to **InnoDB** that
    provide a query interface to the `InnoDB` data
    dictionary. You use these tables not to see how the database is
    structured, but to get real-time information about the workings
    of `InnoDB` tables to help with performance
    monitoring, tuning, and troubleshooting.

    See Also [data dictionary](glossary.md#glos_data_dictionary), [database](glossary.md#glos_database), [InnoDB](glossary.md#glos_innodb).

InnoDB
:   A MySQL component that combines high performance with
    **transactional** capability for
    reliability, robustness, and concurrent access. It embodies the
    **ACID** design philosophy.
    Represented as a **storage
    engine**; it handles tables created or altered with the
    `ENGINE=INNODB` clause. See
    [Chapter 17, *The InnoDB Storage Engine*](innodb-storage-engine.md "Chapter 17 The InnoDB Storage Engine") for architectural
    details and administration procedures, and
    [Section 10.5, “Optimizing for InnoDB Tables”](optimizing-innodb.md "10.5 Optimizing for InnoDB Tables") for performance advice.

    In MySQL 5.5 and higher, `InnoDB` is the
    default storage engine for new tables and the
    `ENGINE=INNODB` clause is not required.

    `InnoDB` tables are ideally suited for
    **hot backups**. See
    [Section 32.1, “MySQL Enterprise Backup Overview”](mysql-enterprise-backup.md "32.1 MySQL Enterprise Backup Overview") for information about
    the **MySQL Enterprise Backup** product for backing
    up MySQL servers without interrupting normal processing.

    See Also [ACID](glossary.md#glos_acid), [hot backup](glossary.md#glos_hot_backup), [MySQL Enterprise Backup](glossary.md#glos_mysql_enterprise_backup), [storage engine](glossary.md#glos_storage_engine), [transaction](glossary.md#glos_transaction).

innodb\_autoinc\_lock\_mode
:   The [`innodb_autoinc_lock_mode`](innodb-parameters.md#sysvar_innodb_autoinc_lock_mode)
    option controls the algorithm used for
    **auto-increment locking**. When
    you have an auto-incrementing **primary
    key**, you can use statement-based replication only
    with the setting
    [`innodb_autoinc_lock_mode=1`](innodb-parameters.md#sysvar_innodb_autoinc_lock_mode).
    This setting is known as *consecutive* lock
    mode, because multi-row inserts within a transaction receive
    consecutive auto-increment values. If you have
    [`innodb_autoinc_lock_mode=2`](innodb-parameters.md#sysvar_innodb_autoinc_lock_mode),
    which allows higher concurrency for insert operations, use
    row-based replication rather than statement-based replication.
    This setting is known as *interleaved* lock
    mode, because multiple multi-row insert statements running at
    the same time can receive
    **auto-increment** values that are
    interleaved. The setting
    [`innodb_autoinc_lock_mode=0`](innodb-parameters.md#sysvar_innodb_autoinc_lock_mode)
    should not be used except for compatibility purposes.

    Consecutive lock mode
    ([`innodb_autoinc_lock_mode=1`](innodb-parameters.md#sysvar_innodb_autoinc_lock_mode)) is
    the default setting prior to MySQL 8.0.3. As of MySQL 8.0.3,
    interleaved lock mode
    ([`innodb_autoinc_lock_mode=2`](innodb-parameters.md#sysvar_innodb_autoinc_lock_mode)) is
    the default, which reflects the change from statement-based to
    row-based replication as the default replication type.

    See Also [auto-increment](glossary.md#glos_auto_increment), [auto-increment locking](glossary.md#glos_auto_increment_locking), [mixed-mode insert](glossary.md#glos_mixed_mode_insert), [primary key](glossary.md#glos_primary_key).

innodb\_file\_per\_table
:   An important configuration option that affects many aspects of
    `InnoDB` file storage, availability of
    features, and I/O characteristics. In MySQL 5.6.7 and higher, it
    is enabled by default. The
    [`innodb_file_per_table`](innodb-parameters.md#sysvar_innodb_file_per_table) option
    turns on **file-per-table** mode.
    With this mode enabled, a newly created
    `InnoDB` table and associated indexes can be
    stored in a file-per-table **.ibd
    file**, outside the **system
    tablespace**.

    This option affects the performance and storage considerations
    for a number of SQL statements, such as
    [`DROP TABLE`](drop-table.md "15.1.32 DROP TABLE Statement") and
    [`TRUNCATE TABLE`](truncate-table.md "15.1.37 TRUNCATE TABLE Statement").

    Enabling the
    [`innodb_file_per_table`](innodb-parameters.md#sysvar_innodb_file_per_table) option
    allows you to take advantage of features such as table
    **compression** and named-table
    backups in **MySQL Enterprise Backup**.

    For more information, see
    [`innodb_file_per_table`](innodb-parameters.md#sysvar_innodb_file_per_table), and
    [Section 17.6.3.2, “File-Per-Table Tablespaces”](innodb-file-per-table-tablespaces.md "17.6.3.2 File-Per-Table Tablespaces").

    See Also [compression](glossary.md#glos_compression), [file-per-table](glossary.md#glos_file_per_table), [.ibd file](glossary.md#glos_ibd_file), [MySQL Enterprise Backup](glossary.md#glos_mysql_enterprise_backup), [system tablespace](glossary.md#glos_system_tablespace).

innodb\_lock\_wait\_timeout
:   The [`innodb_lock_wait_timeout`](innodb-parameters.md#sysvar_innodb_lock_wait_timeout)
    option sets the balance between
    **waiting** for shared resources to
    become available, or giving up and handling the error, retrying,
    or doing alternative processing in your application. Rolls back
    any `InnoDB` transaction that waits more than a
    specified time to acquire a
    **lock**. Especially useful if
    **deadlocks** are caused by updates
    to multiple tables controlled by different storage engines; such
    deadlocks are not **detected**
    automatically.

    See Also [deadlock](glossary.md#glos_deadlock), [deadlock detection](glossary.md#glos_deadlock_detection), [lock](glossary.md#glos_lock), [wait](glossary.md#glos_wait).

innodb\_strict\_mode
:   The [`innodb_strict_mode`](innodb-parameters.md#sysvar_innodb_strict_mode) option
    controls whether `InnoDB` operates in
    **strict mode**, where conditions
    that are normally treated as warnings, cause errors instead (and
    the underlying statements fail).

    See Also [strict mode](glossary.md#glos_strict_mode).

Innovation Series
:   Innovation releases with the same major version form an
    Innovation series. For example, MySQL 8.1 through 8.3 form the
    MySQL 8 Innovation series.

    See Also [LTS Series](glossary.md#glos_lts_series).

insert
:   One of the primary **DML**
    operations in **SQL**. The
    performance of inserts is a key factor in
    **data warehouse** systems that
    load millions of rows into tables, and
    **OLTP** systems where many
    concurrent connections might insert rows into the same table, in
    arbitrary order. If insert performance is important to you, you
    should learn about **InnoDB**
    features such as the **insert
    buffer** used in **change
    buffering**, and
    **auto-increment** columns.

    See Also [auto-increment](glossary.md#glos_auto_increment), [change buffering](glossary.md#glos_change_buffering), [data warehouse](glossary.md#glos_data_warehouse), [DML](glossary.md#glos_dml), [InnoDB](glossary.md#glos_innodb), [insert buffer](glossary.md#glos_insert_buffer), [OLTP](glossary.md#glos_oltp), [SQL](glossary.md#glos_sql).

insert buffer
:   The former name of the **change
    buffer**. In MySQL 5.5, support was added for buffering
    changes to secondary index pages for
    [`DELETE`](delete.md "15.2.2 DELETE Statement") and
    [`UPDATE`](update.md "15.2.17 UPDATE Statement") operations. Previously,
    only changes resulting from
    [`INSERT`](insert.md "15.2.7 INSERT Statement") operations were buffered.
    The preferred term is now *change buffer*.

    See Also [change buffer](glossary.md#glos_change_buffer), [change buffering](glossary.md#glos_change_buffering).

insert buffering
:   The technique of storing changes to secondary index pages,
    resulting from [`INSERT`](insert.md "15.2.7 INSERT Statement") operations,
    in the **change buffer** rather
    than writing the changes immediately, so that the physical
    writes can be performed to minimize random I/O. It is one of the
    types of **change buffering**; the
    others are **delete buffering** and
    **purge buffering**.

    Insert buffering is not used if the secondary index is
    **unique**, because the uniqueness
    of new values cannot be verified before the new entries are
    written out. Other kinds of change buffering do work for unique
    indexes.

    See Also [change buffer](glossary.md#glos_change_buffer), [change buffering](glossary.md#glos_change_buffering), [delete buffering](glossary.md#glos_delete_buffering), [insert buffer](glossary.md#glos_insert_buffer), [purge buffering](glossary.md#glos_purge_buffering), [unique index](glossary.md#glos_unique_index).

insert intention lock
:   A type of **gap lock** that is set
    by [`INSERT`](insert.md "15.2.7 INSERT Statement") operations prior to row
    insertion. This type of **lock**
    signals the intent to insert in such a way that multiple
    transactions inserting into the same index gap need not wait for
    each other if they are not inserting at the same position within
    the gap. For more information, see
    [Section 17.7.1, “InnoDB Locking”](innodb-locking.md "17.7.1 InnoDB Locking").

    See Also [gap lock](glossary.md#glos_gap_lock), [lock](glossary.md#glos_lock), [next-key lock](glossary.md#glos_next_key_lock).

instance
:   A single **mysqld** daemon managing
    a **data directory** representing
    one or more **databases** with a
    set of **tables**. It is common in
    development, testing, and some
    **replication** scenarios to have
    multiple instances on the same
    **server** machine, each managing
    its own data directory and listening on its own port or socket.
    With one instance running a
    **disk-bound** workload, the server
    might still have extra CPU and memory capacity to run additional
    instances.

    See Also [data directory](glossary.md#glos_data_directory), [database](glossary.md#glos_database), [disk-bound](glossary.md#glos_disk_bound), [mysqld](glossary.md#glos_mysqld), [replication](glossary.md#glos_replication), [server](glossary.md#glos_server), [table](glossary.md#glos_table).

instrumentation
:   Modifications at the source code level to collect performance
    data for tuning and debugging. In MySQL, data collected by
    instrumentation is exposed through an SQL interface using the
    `INFORMATION_SCHEMA` and
    `PERFORMANCE_SCHEMA` databases.

    See Also [INFORMATION\_SCHEMA](glossary.md#glos_information_schema), [Performance Schema](glossary.md#glos_performance_schema).

intention exclusive lock
:   See [intention lock](glossary.md#glos_intention_lock).

intention lock
:   A kind of **lock** that applies to
    the table, used to indicate the kind of lock the
    **transaction** intends to acquire
    on rows in the table. Different transactions can acquire
    different kinds of intention locks on the same table, but the
    first transaction to acquire an *intention
    exclusive* (IX) lock on a table prevents other
    transactions from acquiring any S or X locks on the table.
    Conversely, the first transaction to acquire an
    *intention shared* (IS) lock on a table
    prevents other transactions from acquiring any X locks on the
    table. The two-phase process allows the lock requests to be
    resolved in order, without blocking locks and corresponding
    operations that are compatible. For more information about this
    locking mechanism, see [Section 17.7.1, “InnoDB Locking”](innodb-locking.md "17.7.1 InnoDB Locking").

    See Also [lock](glossary.md#glos_lock), [lock mode](glossary.md#glos_lock_mode), [locking](glossary.md#glos_locking), [transaction](glossary.md#glos_transaction).

intention shared lock
:   See [intention lock](glossary.md#glos_intention_lock).

interceptor
:   Code for instrumenting or debugging some aspect of an
    application, which can be enabled without recompiling or
    changing the source of the application itself.

    See Also [command interceptor](glossary.md#glos_command_interceptor), [Connector/J](glossary.md#glos_connector_j), [Connector/NET](glossary.md#glos_connector_net), [exception interceptor](glossary.md#glos_exception_interceptor).

intrinsic temporary table
:   An optimized internal `InnoDB` temporary table
    used by the *optimizer*.

    See Also [optimizer](glossary.md#glos_optimizer).

inverted index
:   A data structure optimized for document retrieval systems, used
    in the implementation of `InnoDB`
    **full-text search**. The
    `InnoDB` **FULLTEXT
    index**, implemented as an inverted index, records the
    position of each word within a document, rather than the
    location of a table row. A single column value (a document
    stored as a text string) is represented by many entries in the
    inverted index.

    See Also [full-text search](glossary.md#glos_full_text_search), [FULLTEXT index](glossary.md#glos_fulltext_index), [ilist](glossary.md#glos_ilist).

IOPS
:   Acronym for **I/O operations per
    second**. A common measurement for busy systems,
    particularly **OLTP** applications.
    If this value is near the maximum that the storage devices can
    handle, the application can become
    **disk-bound**, limiting
    **scalability**.

    See Also [disk-bound](glossary.md#glos_disk_bound), [OLTP](glossary.md#glos_oltp), [scalability](glossary.md#glos_scalability).

isolation level
:   One of the foundations of database processing. Isolation is the
    **I** in the acronym
    **ACID**; the isolation level is
    the setting that fine-tunes the balance between performance and
    reliability, consistency, and reproducibility of results when
    multiple **transactions** are
    making changes and performing queries at the same time.

    From highest amount of consistency and protection to the least,
    the isolation levels supported by InnoDB are:
    **SERIALIZABLE**,
    **REPEATABLE READ**,
    **READ COMMITTED**, and
    **READ UNCOMMITTED**.

    With `InnoDB` tables, many users can keep the
    default isolation level (*REPEATABLE READ*)
    for all operations. Expert users might choose the
    **READ COMMITTED** level as they
    push the boundaries of scalability with
    **OLTP** processing, or during data
    warehousing operations where minor inconsistencies do not affect
    the aggregate results of large amounts of data. The levels on
    the edges (**SERIALIZABLE** and
    **READ UNCOMMITTED**) change the
    processing behavior to such an extent that they are rarely used.

    See Also [ACID](glossary.md#glos_acid), [OLTP](glossary.md#glos_oltp), [READ COMMITTED](glossary.md#glos_read_committed), [READ UNCOMMITTED](glossary.md#glos_read_uncommitted), [REPEATABLE READ](glossary.md#glos_repeatable_read), [SERIALIZABLE](glossary.md#glos_serializable), [transaction](glossary.md#glos_transaction).

### J

J2EE
:   Java Platform, Enterprise Edition: Oracle's enterprise Java
    platform. It consists of an API and a runtime environment for
    enterprise-class Java applications. For full details, see

    With MySQL applications, you typically use
    **Connector/J** for database
    access, and an application server such as
    **Tomcat** or
    **JBoss** to handle the middle-tier
    work, and optionally a framework such as
    **Spring**. Database-related
    features often offered within a J2EE stack include a
    **connection pool** and
    **failover** support.

    See Also [connection pool](glossary.md#glos_connection_pool), [Connector/J](glossary.md#glos_connector_j), [failover](glossary.md#glos_failover), [Java](glossary.md#glos_java), [JBoss](glossary.md#glos_jboss), [Spring](glossary.md#glos_spring), [Tomcat](glossary.md#glos_tomcat).

Java
:   A programming language combining high performance, rich built-in
    features and data types, object-oriented mechanisms, extensive
    standard library, and wide range of reusable third-party
    modules. Enterprise development is supported by many frameworks,
    application servers, and other technologies. Much of its syntax
    is familiar to **C** and
    **C++** developers. To write Java
    applications with MySQL, you use the
    **JDBC** driver known as
    **Connector/J**.

    See Also [C](glossary.md#glos_c), [Connector/J](glossary.md#glos_connector_j), [C++](glossary.md#glos_cplusplus), [JDBC](glossary.md#glos_jdbc).

JBoss
:   See Also [J2EE](glossary.md#glos_j2ee).

JDBC
:   Abbreviation for “Java Database Connectivity”, an
    **API** for database access from
    **Java** applications. Java
    developers writing MySQL applications use the
    **Connector/J** component as their
    JDBC driver.

    See Also [API](glossary.md#glos_api), [Connector/J](glossary.md#glos_connector_j), [J2EE](glossary.md#glos_j2ee), [Java](glossary.md#glos_java).

JNDI
:   See Also [Java](glossary.md#glos_java).

join
:   A **query** that retrieves data
    from more than one table, by referencing columns in the tables
    that hold identical values. Ideally, these columns are part of
    an `InnoDB` **foreign
    key** relationship, which ensures
    **referential integrity** and that
    the join columns are **indexed**.
    Often used to save space and improve query performance by
    replacing repeated strings with numeric IDs, in a
    **normalized** data design.

    See Also [foreign key](glossary.md#glos_foreign_key), [index](glossary.md#glos_index), [normalized](glossary.md#glos_normalized), [query](glossary.md#glos_query), [referential integrity](glossary.md#glos_referential_integrity).

### K

KDC
:   See [key distribution center](glossary.md#glos_key_distribution_center).

key distribution center
:   In Kerberos, the key distribution center comprises an
    authentication server (AS) and a ticket-granting server (TGS).

    See Also [authentication server](glossary.md#glos_authentication_server), [ticket-granting ticket](glossary.md#glos_ticket_granting_ticket).

keystore
:   See Also [SSL](glossary.md#glos_ssl).

KEY\_BLOCK\_SIZE
:   An option to specify the size of data pages within an
    `InnoDB` table that uses
    **compressed row format**. The
    default is 8 kilobytes. Lower values risk hitting internal
    limits that depend on the combination of row size and
    compression percentage.

    For [`MyISAM`](myisam-storage-engine.md "18.2 The MyISAM Storage Engine") tables,
    `KEY_BLOCK_SIZE` optionally specifies the size
    in bytes to use for index key blocks. The value is treated as a
    hint; a different size could be used if necessary. A
    `KEY_BLOCK_SIZE` value specified for an
    individual index definition overrides a table-level
    `KEY_BLOCK_SIZE` value.

    See Also [compressed row format](glossary.md#glos_compressed_row_format).

### L

latch
:   A lightweight structure used by `InnoDB` to
    implement a **lock** for its own
    internal memory structures, typically held for a brief time
    measured in milliseconds or microseconds. A general term that
    includes both **mutexes** (for
    exclusive access) and **rw-locks**
    (for shared access). Certain latches are the focus of
    `InnoDB` performance tuning. Statistics about
    latch use and contention are available through the
    **Performance Schema** interface.

    See Also [lock](glossary.md#glos_lock), [locking](glossary.md#glos_locking), [mutex](glossary.md#glos_mutex), [Performance Schema](glossary.md#glos_performance_schema), [rw-lock](glossary.md#glos_rw_lock).

libmysql
:   Informal name for the
    **libmysqlclient** library.

    See Also [libmysqlclient](glossary.md#glos_libmysqlclient).

libmysqlclient
:   The library file, named `libmysqlclient.a` or
    `libmysqlclient.so`, that is typically linked
    into **client** programs written in
    **C**. Sometimes known informally
    as **libmysql** or the
    **mysqlclient** library.

    See Also [client](glossary.md#glos_client), [libmysql](glossary.md#glos_libmysql), [mysqlclient](glossary.md#glos_mysqlclient).

libmysqld
:   This **embedded** MySQL server
    library makes it possible to run a full-featured MySQL server
    inside a **client** application.
    The main benefits are increased speed and more simple management
    for embedded applications. You link with the
    `libmysqld` library rather than
    **libmysqlclient**. The API is
    identical between all three of these libraries.

    See Also [client](glossary.md#glos_client), [embedded](glossary.md#glos_embedded), [libmysql](glossary.md#glos_libmysql), [libmysqlclient](glossary.md#glos_libmysqlclient).

lifecycle interceptor
:   A type of **interceptor** supported
    by **Connector/J**. It involves
    implementing the interface
    `com.mysql.jdbc.ConnectionLifecycleInterceptor`.

    See Also [Connector/J](glossary.md#glos_connector_j), [interceptor](glossary.md#glos_interceptor).

list
:   The `InnoDB` **buffer
    pool** is represented as a list of memory
    **pages**. The list is reordered as
    new pages are accessed and enter the buffer pool, as pages
    within the buffer pool are accessed again and are considered
    newer, and as pages that are not accessed for a long time are
    **evicted** from the buffer pool.
    The buffer pool is divided into
    **sublists**, and the replacement
    policy is a variation of the familiar
    **LRU** technique.

    See Also [buffer pool](glossary.md#glos_buffer_pool), [eviction](glossary.md#glos_eviction), [LRU](glossary.md#glos_lru), [page](glossary.md#glos_page), [sublist](glossary.md#glos_sublist).

load balancing
:   A technique for scaling read-only connections by sending query
    requests to different slave servers in a replication or Cluster
    configuration. With
    **Connector/J**, load balancing is
    enabled through the
    `com.mysql.jdbc.ReplicationDriver` class and
    controlled by the configuration property
    `loadBalanceStrategy`.

    See Also [Connector/J](glossary.md#glos_connector_j), [J2EE](glossary.md#glos_j2ee).

localhost
:   See Also [connection](glossary.md#glos_connection).

lock
:   The high-level notion of an object that controls access to a
    resource, such as a table, row, or internal data structure, as
    part of a **locking** strategy. For
    intensive performance tuning, you might delve into the actual
    structures that implement locks, such as
    **mutexes** and
    **latches**.

    See Also [latch](glossary.md#glos_latch), [lock mode](glossary.md#glos_lock_mode), [locking](glossary.md#glos_locking), [mutex](glossary.md#glos_mutex).

lock escalation
:   An operation used in some database systems that converts many
    **row locks** into a single
    **table lock**, saving memory space
    but reducing concurrent access to the table.
    `InnoDB` uses a space-efficient representation
    for row locks, so that **lock**
    escalation is not needed.

    See Also [locking](glossary.md#glos_locking), [row lock](glossary.md#glos_row_lock), [table lock](glossary.md#glos_table_lock).

lock mode
:   A shared (S) **lock** allows a
    **transaction** to read a row.
    Multiple transactions can acquire an S lock on that same row at
    the same time.

    An exclusive (X) lock allows a transaction to update or delete a
    row. No other transaction can acquire any kind of lock on that
    same row at the same time.

    **Intention locks** apply to the
    table, and are used to indicate what kind of lock the
    transaction intends to acquire on rows in the table. Different
    transactions can acquire different kinds of intention locks on
    the same table, but the first transaction to acquire an
    intention exclusive (IX) lock on a table prevents other
    transactions from acquiring any S or X locks on the table.
    Conversely, the first transaction to acquire an intention shared
    (IS) lock on a table prevents other transactions from acquiring
    any X locks on the table. The two-phase process allows the lock
    requests to be resolved in order, without blocking locks and
    corresponding operations that are compatible.

    See Also [intention lock](glossary.md#glos_intention_lock), [lock](glossary.md#glos_lock), [locking](glossary.md#glos_locking), [transaction](glossary.md#glos_transaction).

locking
:   The system of protecting a
    **transaction** from seeing or
    changing data that is being queried or changed by other
    transactions. The **locking**
    strategy must balance reliability and consistency of database
    operations (the principles of the
    **ACID** philosophy) against the
    performance needed for good
    **concurrency**. Fine-tuning the
    locking strategy often involves choosing an
    **isolation level** and ensuring
    all your database operations are safe and reliable for that
    isolation level.

    See Also [ACID](glossary.md#glos_acid), [concurrency](glossary.md#glos_concurrency), [isolation level](glossary.md#glos_isolation_level), [locking](glossary.md#glos_locking), [transaction](glossary.md#glos_transaction).

locking read
:   A [`SELECT`](select.md "15.2.13 SELECT Statement") statement that also
    performs a **locking** operation on
    an `InnoDB` table. Either `SELECT ...
    FOR UPDATE` or `SELECT ...
    LOCK IN SHARE MODE`. It has the potential to produce a
    **deadlock**, depending on the
    **isolation level** of the
    transaction. The opposite of a **non-locking
    read**. Not allowed for global tables in a
    **read-only transaction**.

    `SELECT ... FOR SHARE` replaces `SELECT
    ... LOCK IN SHARE MODE` in MySQL 8.0.1, but
    `LOCK IN SHARE MODE` remains available for
    backward compatibility.

    See [Section 17.7.2.4, “Locking Reads”](innodb-locking-reads.md "17.7.2.4 Locking Reads").

    See Also [deadlock](glossary.md#glos_deadlock), [isolation level](glossary.md#glos_isolation_level), [locking](glossary.md#glos_locking), [non-locking read](glossary.md#glos_non_locking_read), [read-only transaction](glossary.md#glos_read_only_transaction).

log
:   In the `InnoDB` context, “log” or
    “log files” typically refers to the
    **redo log** represented by the
    **ib\_logfile*`N`***
    files. Another type of `InnoDB` log is the
    **undo log**, which is a storage
    area that holds copies of data modified by active transactions.

    Other kinds of logs that are important in MySQL are the
    **error log** (for diagnosing
    startup and runtime problems), **binary
    log** (for working with replication and performing
    point-in-time restores), the **general query
    log** (for diagnosing application problems), and the
    **slow query log** (for diagnosing
    performance problems).

    See Also [binary log](glossary.md#glos_binary_log), [error log](glossary.md#glos_error_log), [general query log](glossary.md#glos_general_query_log), [ib\_logfile](glossary.md#glos_ib_logfile), [redo log](glossary.md#glos_redo_log), [slow query log](glossary.md#glos_slow_query_log), [undo log](glossary.md#glos_undo_log).

log buffer
:   The memory area that holds data to be written to the
    **log files** that make up the
    **redo log**. It is controlled by
    the [`innodb_log_buffer_size`](innodb-parameters.md#sysvar_innodb_log_buffer_size)
    configuration option.

    See Also [log file](glossary.md#glos_log_file), [redo log](glossary.md#glos_redo_log).

log file
:   One of the
    **ib\_logfile*`N`***
    files that make up the **redo
    log**. Data is written to these files from the
    **log buffer** memory area.

    See Also [ib\_logfile](glossary.md#glos_ib_logfile), [log buffer](glossary.md#glos_log_buffer), [redo log](glossary.md#glos_redo_log).

log group
:   The set of files that make up the **redo
    log**, typically named `ib_logfile0`
    and `ib_logfile1`. (For that reason, sometimes
    referred to collectively as
    **ib\_logfile**.)

    See Also [ib\_logfile](glossary.md#glos_ib_logfile), [redo log](glossary.md#glos_redo_log).

logical
:   A type of operation that involves high-level, abstract aspects
    such as tables, queries, indexes, and other SQL concepts.
    Typically, logical aspects are important to make database
    administration and application development convenient and
    usable. Contrast with **physical**.

    See Also [logical backup](glossary.md#glos_logical_backup), [physical](glossary.md#glos_physical).

logical backup
:   A **backup** that reproduces table
    structure and data, without copying the actual data files. For
    example, the
    **`mysqldump`**
    command produces a logical backup, because its output contains
    statements such as [`CREATE TABLE`](create-table.md "15.1.20 CREATE TABLE Statement")
    and [`INSERT`](insert.md "15.2.7 INSERT Statement") that can re-create the
    data. Contrast with **physical
    backup**. A logical backup offers flexibility (for
    example, you could edit table definitions or insert statements
    before restoring), but can take substantially longer to
    **restore** than a physical backup.

    See Also [backup](glossary.md#glos_backup), [mysqldump](glossary.md#glos_mysqldump), [physical backup](glossary.md#glos_physical_backup), [restore](glossary.md#glos_restore).

loose\_
:   A prefix added to `InnoDB` configuration
    options after server **startup**,
    so any new configuration options not recognized by the current
    level of MySQL do not cause a startup failure. MySQL processes
    configuration options that start with this prefix, but gives a
    warning rather than a failure if the part after the prefix is
    not a recognized option.

    See Also [startup](glossary.md#glos_startup).

low-water mark
:   A value representing a lower limit, typically a threshold value
    at which some corrective action begins or becomes more
    aggressive. Contrast with **high-water
    mark**.

    See Also [high-water mark](glossary.md#glos_high_water_mark).

LRU
:   An acronym for “least recently used”, a common
    method for managing storage areas. The items that have not been
    used recently are **evicted** when
    space is needed to cache newer items. `InnoDB`
    uses the LRU mechanism by default to manage the
    **pages** within the
    **buffer pool**, but makes
    exceptions in cases where a page might be read only a single
    time, such as during a **full table
    scan**. This variation of the LRU algorithm is called
    the **midpoint insertion
    strategy**. For more information, see
    [Section 17.5.1, “Buffer Pool”](innodb-buffer-pool.md "17.5.1 Buffer Pool").

    See Also [buffer pool](glossary.md#glos_buffer_pool), [eviction](glossary.md#glos_eviction), [full table scan](glossary.md#glos_full_table_scan), [midpoint insertion strategy](glossary.md#glos_midpoint_insertion_strategy), [page](glossary.md#glos_page).

LSN
:   Acronym for “log sequence number”. This arbitrary,
    ever-increasing value represents a point in time corresponding
    to operations recorded in the **redo
    log**. (This point in time is regardless of
    **transaction** boundaries; it can
    fall in the middle of one or more transactions.) It is used
    internally by `InnoDB` during
    **crash recovery** and for managing
    the **buffer pool**.

    Prior to MySQL 5.6.3, the LSN was a 4-byte unsigned integer. The
    LSN became an 8-byte unsigned integer in MySQL 5.6.3 when the
    redo log file size limit increased from 4GB to 512GB, as
    additional bytes were required to store extra size information.
    Applications built on MySQL 5.6.3 or later that use LSN values
    should use 64-bit rather than 32-bit variables to store and
    compare LSN values.

    In the **MySQL Enterprise Backup** product, you can
    specify an LSN to represent the point in time from which to take
    an **incremental backup**. The
    relevant LSN is displayed by the output of the
    **mysqlbackup** command. Once you have the LSN
    corresponding to the time of a full backup, you can specify that
    value to take a subsequent incremental backup, whose output
    contains another LSN for the next incremental backup.

    See Also [buffer pool](glossary.md#glos_buffer_pool), [crash recovery](glossary.md#glos_crash_recovery), [incremental backup](glossary.md#glos_incremental_backup), [MySQL Enterprise Backup](glossary.md#glos_mysql_enterprise_backup), [redo log](glossary.md#glos_redo_log), [transaction](glossary.md#glos_transaction).

LTS Series
:   LTS releases with the same major version number form an LTS
    series. For example, all MySQL 8.4.x releases form the MySQL 8.4
    LTS series.

    Note: MySQL 8.0 is a Bugfix series that preceded the LTS release
    model.

    See Also [Innovation Series](glossary.md#glos_innovation_series).

### M

.MRG file
:   A file containing references to other tables, used by the
    `MERGE` storage engine. Files with this
    extension are always included in backups produced by the
    **mysqlbackup** command of the
    **MySQL Enterprise Backup** product.

    See Also [MySQL Enterprise Backup](glossary.md#glos_mysql_enterprise_backup), [mysqlbackup command](glossary.md#glos_mysqlbackup_command).

.MYD file
:   A file that MySQL uses to store data for a
    [`MyISAM`](myisam-storage-engine.md "18.2 The MyISAM Storage Engine") table.

    See Also [.MYI file](glossary.md#glos_myi_file), [MySQL Enterprise Backup](glossary.md#glos_mysql_enterprise_backup), [mysqlbackup command](glossary.md#glos_mysqlbackup_command).

.MYI file
:   A file that MySQL uses to store indexes for a
    [`MyISAM`](myisam-storage-engine.md "18.2 The MyISAM Storage Engine") table.

    See Also [.MYD file](glossary.md#glos_myd_file), [MySQL Enterprise Backup](glossary.md#glos_mysql_enterprise_backup), [mysqlbackup command](glossary.md#glos_mysqlbackup_command).

master
:   See [source](glossary.md#glos_source).

master thread
:   An `InnoDB`
    **thread** that performs various
    tasks in the background. Most of these tasks are I/O related,
    such as writing changes from the **change
    buffer** to the appropriate secondary indexes.

    To improve **concurrency**,
    sometimes actions are moved from the master thread to separate
    background threads. For example, in MySQL 5.6 and higher,
    **dirty pages** are
    **flushed** from the
    **buffer pool** by the
    **page cleaner** thread rather than
    the master thread.

    See Also [buffer pool](glossary.md#glos_buffer_pool), [change buffer](glossary.md#glos_change_buffer), [concurrency](glossary.md#glos_concurrency), [dirty page](glossary.md#glos_dirty_page), [flush](glossary.md#glos_flush), [page cleaner](glossary.md#glos_page_cleaner), [thread](glossary.md#glos_thread).

MDL
:   Acronym for “metadata lock”.

    See Also [metadata lock](glossary.md#glos_metadata_lock).

medium trust
:   Synonym for **partial trust**.
    Because the range of trust settings is so broad, “partial
    trust” is preferred, to avoid the implication that there
    are only three levels (low, medium, and full).

    See Also [Connector/NET](glossary.md#glos_connector_net), [partial trust](glossary.md#glos_partial_trust).

memcached
:   A popular component of many MySQL and
    **NoSQL** software stacks, allowing
    fast reads and writes for single values and caching the results
    entirely in memory. Traditionally, applications required extra
    logic to write the same data to a MySQL database for permanent
    storage, or to read data from a MySQL database when it was not
    cached yet in memory. Now, applications can use the simple
    **memcached** protocol, supported by client
    libraries for many languages, to communicate directly with MySQL
    servers using `InnoDB` or
    `NDB` tables. These NoSQL interfaces to MySQL
    tables allow applications to achieve higher read and write
    performance than by issuing SQL statements directly, and can
    simplify application logic and deployment configurations for
    systems that already incorporate **memcached**
    for in-memory caching.

    See Also [NoSQL](glossary.md#glos_nosql).

merge
:   To apply changes to data cached in memory, such as when a page
    is brought into the **buffer
    pool**, and any applicable changes recorded in the
    **change buffer** are incorporated
    into the page in the buffer pool. The updated data is eventually
    written to the **tablespace** by
    the **flush** mechanism.

    See Also [buffer pool](glossary.md#glos_buffer_pool), [change buffer](glossary.md#glos_change_buffer), [flush](glossary.md#glos_flush), [tablespace](glossary.md#glos_tablespace).

metadata lock
:   A type of **lock** that prevents
    **DDL** operations on a table that
    is being used at the same time by another
    **transaction**. For details, see
    [Section 10.11.4, “Metadata Locking”](metadata-locking.md "10.11.4 Metadata Locking").

    Enhancements to **online**
    operations, particularly in MySQL 5.6 and higher, are focused on
    reducing the amount of metadata locking. The objective is for
    DDL operations that do not change the table structure (such as
    [`CREATE INDEX`](create-index.md "15.1.15 CREATE INDEX Statement") and
    [`DROP INDEX`](drop-index.md "15.1.27 DROP INDEX Statement") for
    `InnoDB` tables) to proceed while the table is
    being queried, updated, and so on by other transactions.

    See Also [DDL](glossary.md#glos_ddl), [lock](glossary.md#glos_lock), [online](glossary.md#glos_online), [transaction](glossary.md#glos_transaction).

metrics counter
:   A feature implemented by the
    [`INNODB_METRICS`](information-schema-innodb-metrics-table.md "28.4.21 The INFORMATION_SCHEMA INNODB_METRICS Table") table in the
    **INFORMATION\_SCHEMA**, in MySQL
    5.6 and higher. You can query
    **counts** and totals for low-level
    `InnoDB` operations, and use the results for
    performance tuning in combination with data from the
    **Performance Schema**.

    See Also [counter](glossary.md#glos_counter), [INFORMATION\_SCHEMA](glossary.md#glos_information_schema), [Performance Schema](glossary.md#glos_performance_schema).

midpoint insertion strategy
:   The technique of initially bringing
    **pages** into the
    `InnoDB` **buffer
    pool** not at the “newest” end of the
    list, but instead somewhere in the middle. The exact location of
    this point can vary, based on the setting of the
    [`innodb_old_blocks_pct`](innodb-parameters.md#sysvar_innodb_old_blocks_pct) option.
    The intent is that pages that are only read once, such as during
    a **full table scan**, can be aged
    out of the buffer pool sooner than with a strict
    **LRU** algorithm. For more
    information, see [Section 17.5.1, “Buffer Pool”](innodb-buffer-pool.md "17.5.1 Buffer Pool").

    See Also [buffer pool](glossary.md#glos_buffer_pool), [full table scan](glossary.md#glos_full_table_scan), [LRU](glossary.md#glos_lru), [page](glossary.md#glos_page).

mini-transaction
:   An internal phase of `InnoDB` processing, when
    making changes at the **physical**
    level to internal data structures during
    **DML** operations. A
    mini-transaction (mtr) has no notion of
    **rollback**; multiple
    mini-transactions can occur within a single
    **transaction**. Mini-transactions
    write information to the **redo
    log** that is used during **crash
    recovery**. A mini-transaction can also happen outside
    the context of a regular transaction, for example during
    **purge** processing by background
    threads.

    See Also [commit](glossary.md#glos_commit), [crash recovery](glossary.md#glos_crash_recovery), [DML](glossary.md#glos_dml), [physical](glossary.md#glos_physical), [purge](glossary.md#glos_purge), [redo log](glossary.md#glos_redo_log), [rollback](glossary.md#glos_rollback), [transaction](glossary.md#glos_transaction).

mixed-mode insert
:   An [`INSERT`](insert.md "15.2.7 INSERT Statement") statement where
    **auto-increment** values are
    specified for some but not all of the new rows. For example, a
    multi-value `INSERT` could specify a value for
    the auto-increment column in some cases and
    `NULL` in other cases.
    `InnoDB` generates auto-increment values for
    the rows where the column value was specified as
    `NULL`. Another example is an
    [`INSERT ...
    ON DUPLICATE KEY UPDATE`](insert-on-duplicate.md "15.2.7.2 INSERT ... ON DUPLICATE KEY UPDATE Statement") statement, where
    auto-increment values might be generated but not used, for any
    duplicate rows that are processed as `UPDATE`
    rather than `INSERT` statements.

    Can cause consistency issues between
    **source** and
    **replica** servers in a
    **replication** configuration. Can
    require adjusting the value of the
    **innodb\_autoinc\_lock\_mode**
    configuration option.

MM.MySQL
:   An older JDBC driver for MySQL that evolved into
    **Connector/J** when it was
    integrated with the MySQL product.

    See Also [Connector/J](glossary.md#glos_connector_j).

Mono
:   An Open Source framework developed by Novell, that works with
    **Connector/NET** and
    **C#** applications on Linux
    platforms.

    See Also [Connector/NET](glossary.md#glos_connector_net), [C#](glossary.md#glos_csharp).

mtr
:   See [mini-transaction](glossary.md#glos_mini_transaction).

multi-core
:   A type of processor that can take advantage of multithreaded
    programs, such as the MySQL server.

multiversion concurrency control
:   See [MVCC](glossary.md#glos_mvcc).

mutex
:   Informal abbreviation for “mutex variable”. (Mutex
    itself is short for “mutual exclusion”.) The
    low-level object that `InnoDB` uses to
    represent and enforce exclusive-access
    **locks** to internal in-memory
    data structures. Once the lock is acquired, any other process,
    thread, and so on is prevented from acquiring the same lock.
    Contrast with **rw-locks**, which
    `InnoDB` uses to represent and enforce
    shared-access **locks** to internal
    in-memory data structures. Mutexes and rw-locks are known
    collectively as **latches**.

    See Also [latch](glossary.md#glos_latch), [lock](glossary.md#glos_lock), [Performance Schema](glossary.md#glos_performance_schema), [Pthreads](glossary.md#glos_pthreads), [rw-lock](glossary.md#glos_rw_lock).

MVCC
:   Acronym for “multiversion concurrency control”.
    This technique lets `InnoDB`
    **transactions** with certain
    **isolation levels** perform
    **consistent read** operations;
    that is, to query rows that are being updated by other
    transactions, and see the values from before those updates
    occurred. This is a powerful technique to increase
    **concurrency**, by allowing
    queries to proceed without waiting due to
    **locks** held by the other
    transactions.

    This technique is not universal in the database world. Some
    other database products, and some other MySQL storage engines,
    do not support it.

    See Also [ACID](glossary.md#glos_acid), [concurrency](glossary.md#glos_concurrency), [consistent read](glossary.md#glos_consistent_read), [isolation level](glossary.md#glos_isolation_level), [lock](glossary.md#glos_lock), [transaction](glossary.md#glos_transaction).

my.cnf
:   The name, on Unix or Linux systems, of the MySQL
    **option file**.

    See Also [my.ini](glossary.md#glos_my_ini), [option file](glossary.md#glos_option_file).

my.ini
:   The name, on Windows systems, of the MySQL
    **option file**.

    See Also [my.cnf](glossary.md#glos_my_cnf), [option file](glossary.md#glos_option_file).

MyODBC drivers
:   Obsolete name for
    **Connector/ODBC**.

    See Also [Connector/ODBC](glossary.md#glos_connector_odbc).

mysql
:   The [**mysql**](mysql.md "6.5.1 mysql — The MySQL Command-Line Client") program is the command-line
    interpreter for the MySQL database. It processes
    **SQL** statements, and also
    MySQL-specific commands such as [`SHOW
    TABLES`](show-tables.md "15.7.7.39 SHOW TABLES Statement"), by passing requests to the
    [**mysqld**](mysqld.md "6.3.1 mysqld — The MySQL Server") daemon.

    See Also [mysqld](glossary.md#glos_mysqld), [SQL](glossary.md#glos_sql).

mysqlbackup command
:   A command-line tool of the
    **MySQL Enterprise Backup** product. It performs a
    **hot backup** operation for
    [`InnoDB`](innodb-storage-engine.md "Chapter 17 The InnoDB Storage Engine") tables, and a
    [warm backup](glossary.md#glos_warm_backup "warm backup") for
    [`MyISAM`](myisam-storage-engine.md "18.2 The MyISAM Storage Engine") and other kinds of tables.
    See [Section 32.1, “MySQL Enterprise Backup Overview”](mysql-enterprise-backup.md "32.1 MySQL Enterprise Backup Overview") for more
    information about this command.

    See Also [hot backup](glossary.md#glos_hot_backup), [MySQL Enterprise Backup](glossary.md#glos_mysql_enterprise_backup), [warm backup](glossary.md#glos_warm_backup).

mysqlclient
:   The informal name for the library that is implemented by the
    file **libmysqlclient**, with
    extension `.a` or `.so`.

    See Also [libmysqlclient](glossary.md#glos_libmysqlclient).

mysqld
:   [**mysqld**](mysqld.md "6.3.1 mysqld — The MySQL Server"), also known as MySQL Server, is a
    single multithreaded program that does most of the work in a
    MySQL installation. It does not spawn additional processes.
    MySQL Server manages access to the MySQL data directory that
    contains databases, tables, and other information such as log
    files and status files.

    [**mysqld**](mysqld.md "6.3.1 mysqld — The MySQL Server") runs as a Unix daemon or Windows
    service, constantly waiting for requests and performing
    maintenance work in the background.

    See Also [instance](glossary.md#glos_instance), [mysql](glossary.md#glos_mysql).

MySQLdb
:   The name of the open-source
    **Python** module that forms the
    basis of the MySQL **Python API**.

    See Also [Python](glossary.md#glos_python), [Python API](glossary.md#glos_python_api).

mysqldump
:   A command that performs a **logical
    backup** of some combination of databases, tables, and
    table data. The results are SQL statements that reproduce the
    original schema objects, data, or both. For substantial amounts
    of data, a **physical backup**
    solution such as **MySQL Enterprise Backup** is
    faster, particularly for the
    **restore** operation.

    See Also [logical backup](glossary.md#glos_logical_backup), [MySQL Enterprise Backup](glossary.md#glos_mysql_enterprise_backup), [physical backup](glossary.md#glos_physical_backup), [restore](glossary.md#glos_restore).

### N

.NET
:   See Also [ADO.NET](glossary.md#glos_ado_net), [ASP.net](glossary.md#glos_asp_net), [Connector/NET](glossary.md#glos_connector_net), [Mono](glossary.md#glos_mono), [Visual Studio](glossary.md#glos_visual_studio).

native C API
:   Synonym for **libmysqlclient**.

    See Also [libmysql](glossary.md#glos_libmysql).

natural key
:   An indexed column, typically a **primary
    key**, where the values have some real-world
    significance. Usually advised against because:

    - If the value should ever change, there is potentially a lot
      of index maintenance to re-sort the
      **clustered index** and update
      the copies of the primary key value that are repeated in
      each **secondary index**.
    - Even seemingly stable values can change in unpredictable
      ways that are difficult to represent correctly in the
      database. For example, one country can change into two or
      several, making the original country code obsolete. Or,
      rules about unique values might have exceptions. For
      example, even if taxpayer IDs are intended to be unique to a
      single person, a database might have to handle records that
      violate that rule, such as in cases of identity theft.
      Taxpayer IDs and other sensitive ID numbers also make poor
      primary keys, because they may need to be secured,
      encrypted, and otherwise treated differently than other
      columns.

    Thus, it is typically better to use arbitrary numeric values to
    form a **synthetic key**, for
    example using an **auto-increment**
    column.

    See Also [auto-increment](glossary.md#glos_auto_increment), [clustered index](glossary.md#glos_clustered_index), [primary key](glossary.md#glos_primary_key), [secondary index](glossary.md#glos_secondary_index), [synthetic key](glossary.md#glos_synthetic_key).

neighbor page
:   Any **page** in the same
    **extent** as a particular page.
    When a page is selected to be
    **flushed**, any neighbor pages
    that are **dirty** are typically
    flushed as well, as an I/O optimization for traditional hard
    disks. In MySQL 5.6 and up, this behavior can be controlled by
    the configuration variable
    [`innodb_flush_neighbors`](innodb-parameters.md#sysvar_innodb_flush_neighbors); you
    might turn that setting off for SSD drives, which do not have
    the same overhead for writing smaller batches of data at random
    locations.

    See Also [dirty page](glossary.md#glos_dirty_page), [extent](glossary.md#glos_extent), [flush](glossary.md#glos_flush), [page](glossary.md#glos_page).

next-key lock
:   A combination of a **record lock**
    on the index record and a [gap
    lock](glossary.md#glos_gap_lock "gap lock") on the gap before the index record.

    See Also [gap lock](glossary.md#glos_gap_lock), [locking](glossary.md#glos_locking), [record lock](glossary.md#glos_record_lock).

non-locking read
:   A **query** that does not use the
    `SELECT ... FOR UPDATE` or `SELECT ...
    LOCK IN SHARE MODE` clauses. The only kind of query
    allowed for global tables in a **read-only
    transaction**. The opposite of a
    **locking read**. See
    [Section 17.7.2.3, “Consistent Nonlocking Reads”](innodb-consistent-read.md "17.7.2.3 Consistent Nonlocking Reads").

    `SELECT ... FOR SHARE` replaces `SELECT
    ... LOCK IN SHARE MODE` in MySQL 8.0.1, but
    `LOCK IN SHARE MODE` remains available for
    backward compatibility.

    See Also [locking read](glossary.md#glos_locking_read), [query](glossary.md#glos_query), [read-only transaction](glossary.md#glos_read_only_transaction).

non-repeatable read
:   The situation when a query retrieves data, and a later query
    within the same **transaction**
    retrieves what should be the same data, but the queries return
    different results (changed by another transaction committing in
    the meantime).

    This kind of operation goes against the
    **ACID** principle of database
    design. Within a transaction, data should be consistent, with
    predictable and stable relationships.

    Among different **isolation
    levels**, non-repeatable reads are prevented by the
    **serializable read** and
    **repeatable read** levels, and
    allowed by the **consistent read**,
    and **read uncommitted** levels.

    See Also [ACID](glossary.md#glos_acid), [consistent read](glossary.md#glos_consistent_read), [isolation level](glossary.md#glos_isolation_level), [READ UNCOMMITTED](glossary.md#glos_read_uncommitted), [REPEATABLE READ](glossary.md#glos_repeatable_read), [SERIALIZABLE](glossary.md#glos_serializable), [transaction](glossary.md#glos_transaction).

nonblocking I/O
:   An industry term that means the same as
    **asynchronous I/O**.

    See Also [asynchronous I/O](glossary.md#glos_asynchronous_io).

normalized
:   A database design strategy where data is split into multiple
    tables, and duplicate values condensed into single rows
    represented by an ID, to avoid storing, querying, and updating
    redundant or lengthy values. It is typically used in
    **OLTP** applications.

    For example, an address might be given a unique ID, so that a
    census database could represent the relationship
    **lives at this address** by
    associating that ID with each member of a family, rather than
    storing multiple copies of a complex value such as
    **123 Main Street, Anytown, USA**.

    For another example, although a simple address book application
    might store each phone number in the same table as a person's
    name and address, a phone company database might give each phone
    number a special ID, and store the numbers and IDs in a separate
    table. This normalized representation could simplify large-scale
    updates when area codes split apart.

    Normalization is not always recommended. Data that is primarily
    queried, and only updated by deleting entirely and reloading, is
    often kept in fewer, larger tables with redundant copies of
    duplicate values. This data representation is referred to as
    **denormalized**, and is frequently
    found in data warehousing applications.

    See Also [denormalized](glossary.md#glos_denormalized), [foreign key](glossary.md#glos_foreign_key), [OLTP](glossary.md#glos_oltp), [relational](glossary.md#glos_relational).

NoSQL
:   A broad term for a set of data access technologies that do not
    use the **SQL** language as their
    primary mechanism for reading and writing data. Some NoSQL
    technologies act as key-value stores, only accepting
    single-value reads and writes; some relax the restrictions of
    the **ACID** methodology; still
    others do not require a pre-planned
    **schema**. MySQL users can combine
    NoSQL-style processing for speed and simplicity with SQL
    operations for flexibility and convenience, by using the
    **memcached** API to directly
    access some kinds of MySQL tables.

    See Also [ACID](glossary.md#glos_acid), [memcached](glossary.md#glos_memcached), [schema](glossary.md#glos_schema), [SQL](glossary.md#glos_sql).

NOT NULL constraint
:   A type of **constraint** that
    specifies that a **column** cannot
    contain any **NULL** values. It
    helps to preserve **referential
    integrity**, as the database server can identify data
    with erroneous missing values. It also helps in the arithmetic
    involved in query optimization, allowing the optimizer to
    predict the number of entries in an index on that column.

    See Also [column](glossary.md#glos_column), [constraint](glossary.md#glos_constraint), [NULL](glossary.md#glos_null), [primary key](glossary.md#glos_primary_key), [referential integrity](glossary.md#glos_referential_integrity).

NULL
:   A special value in **SQL**,
    indicating the absence of data. Any arithmetic operation or
    equality test involving a `NULL` value, in turn
    produces a `NULL` result. (Thus it is similar
    to the IEEE floating-point concept of NaN, “not a
    number”.) Any aggregate calculation such as
    `AVG()` ignores rows with
    `NULL` values, when determining how many rows
    to divide by. The only test that works with
    `NULL` values uses the SQL idioms `IS
    NULL` or `IS NOT NULL`.

    `NULL` values play a part in
    **index** operations, because for
    performance a database must minimize the overhead of keeping
    track of missing data values. Typically, `NULL`
    values are not stored in an index, because a query that tests an
    indexed column using a standard comparison operator could never
    match a row with a `NULL` value for that
    column. For the same reason, unique indexes do not prevent
    `NULL` values; those values simply are not
    represented in the index. Declaring a `NOT
    NULL` constraint on a column provides reassurance that
    there are no rows left out of the index, allowing for better
    query optimization (accurate counting of rows and estimation of
    whether to use the index).

    Because the **primary key** must be
    able to uniquely identify every row in the table, a
    single-column primary key cannot contain any
    `NULL` values, and a multi-column primary key
    cannot contain any rows with `NULL` values in
    all columns.

    Although the Oracle database allows a `NULL`
    value to be concatenated with a string,
    `InnoDB` treats the result of such an operation
    as `NULL`.

    See Also [index](glossary.md#glos_index), [primary key](glossary.md#glos_primary_key), [SQL](glossary.md#glos_sql).

### O

.OPT file
:   A file containing database configuration information. Files with
    this extension are included in backups produced by the
    **mysqlbackup** command of the
    **MySQL Enterprise Backup** product.

    See Also [MySQL Enterprise Backup](glossary.md#glos_mysql_enterprise_backup), [mysqlbackup command](glossary.md#glos_mysqlbackup_command).

ODBC
:   Acronym for Open Database Connectivity, an industry-standard
    API. Typically used with Windows-based servers, or applications
    that require ODBC to communicate with MySQL. The MySQL ODBC
    driver is called
    **Connector/ODBC**.

    See Also [Connector/ODBC](glossary.md#glos_connector_odbc).

off-page column
:   A column containing variable-length data (such as
    [`BLOB`](blob.md "13.3.4 The BLOB and TEXT Types") and
    [`VARCHAR`](char.md "13.3.2 The CHAR and VARCHAR Types")) that is too long to fit
    on a **B-tree** page. The data is
    stored in **overflow pages**. The
    **DYNAMIC** row format is more
    efficient for such storage than the older
    **COMPACT** row format.

    See Also [B-tree](glossary.md#glos_b_tree), [compact row format](glossary.md#glos_compact_row_format), [dynamic row format](glossary.md#glos_dynamic_row_format), [overflow page](glossary.md#glos_overflow_page).

OLTP
:   Acronym for “Online Transaction Processing”. A
    database system, or a database application, that runs a workload
    with many **transactions**, with
    frequent writes as well as reads, typically affecting small
    amounts of data at a time. For example, an airline reservation
    system or an application that processes bank deposits. The data
    might be organized in
    **normalized** form for a balance
    between **DML**
    (insert/update/delete) efficiency and
    **query** efficiency. Contrast with
    **data warehouse**.

    With its **row-level locking** and
    **transactional** capability,
    **InnoDB** is the ideal storage
    engine for MySQL tables used in OLTP applications.

    See Also [data warehouse](glossary.md#glos_data_warehouse), [DML](glossary.md#glos_dml), [InnoDB](glossary.md#glos_innodb), [query](glossary.md#glos_query), [row lock](glossary.md#glos_row_lock), [transaction](glossary.md#glos_transaction).

online
:   A type of operation that involves no downtime, blocking, or
    restricted operation for the database. Typically applied to
    **DDL**. Operations that shorten
    the periods of restricted operation, such as
    **fast index creation**, have
    evolved into a wider set of **online
    DDL** operations in MySQL 5.6.

    In the context of backups, a **hot
    backup** is an online operation and a
    **warm backup** is partially an
    online operation.

    See Also [DDL](glossary.md#glos_ddl), [Fast Index Creation](glossary.md#glos_fast_index_creation), [hot backup](glossary.md#glos_hot_backup), [online DDL](glossary.md#glos_online_ddl), [warm backup](glossary.md#glos_warm_backup).

online DDL
:   A feature that improves the performance, concurrency, and
    availability of `InnoDB` tables during
    **DDL** (primarily
    [`ALTER TABLE`](alter-table.md "15.1.9 ALTER TABLE Statement")) operations. See
    [Section 17.12, “InnoDB and Online DDL”](innodb-online-ddl.md "17.12 InnoDB and Online DDL") for details.

    The details vary according to the type of operation. In some
    cases, the table can be modified concurrently while the
    [`ALTER TABLE`](alter-table.md "15.1.9 ALTER TABLE Statement") is in progress. The
    operation might be able to be performed without a table copy, or
    using a specially optimized type of table copy. DML log space
    usage for in-place operations is controlled by the
    [`innodb_online_alter_log_max_size`](innodb-parameters.md#sysvar_innodb_online_alter_log_max_size)
    configuration option.

    This feature is an enhancement of the **Fast
    Index Creation** feature in MySQL 5.5.

    See Also [DDL](glossary.md#glos_ddl), [Fast Index Creation](glossary.md#glos_fast_index_creation), [online](glossary.md#glos_online).

optimistic
:   A methodology that guides low-level implementation decisions for
    a relational database system. The requirements of performance
    and **concurrency** in a relational
    database mean that operations must be started or dispatched
    quickly. The requirements of consistency and
    **referential integrity** mean that
    any operation could fail: a transaction might be rolled back, a
    **DML** operation could violate a
    constraint, a request for a lock could cause a deadlock, a
    network error could cause a timeout. An optimistic strategy is
    one that assumes most requests or attempts succeed, so that
    relatively little work is done to prepare for the failure case.
    When this assumption is true, the database does little
    unnecessary work; when requests do fail, extra work must be done
    to clean up and undo changes.

    `InnoDB` uses optimistic strategies for
    operations such as **locking** and
    **commits**. For example, data
    changed by a transaction can be written to the data files before
    the commit occurs, making the commit itself very fast, but
    requiring more work to undo the changes if the transaction is
    rolled back.

    The opposite of an optimistic strategy is a
    **pessimistic** one, where a system
    is optimized to deal with operations that are unreliable and
    frequently unsuccessful. This methodology is rare in a database
    system, because so much care goes into choosing reliable
    hardware, networks, and algorithms.

    See Also [commit](glossary.md#glos_commit), [concurrency](glossary.md#glos_concurrency), [DML](glossary.md#glos_dml), [locking](glossary.md#glos_locking), [pessimistic](glossary.md#glos_pessimistic), [referential integrity](glossary.md#glos_referential_integrity).

optimizer
:   The MySQL component that determines the best
    **indexes** and
    **join** order to use for a
    **query**, based on characteristics
    and data distribution of the relevant
    **tables**.

    See Also [index](glossary.md#glos_index), [join](glossary.md#glos_join), [query](glossary.md#glos_query), [table](glossary.md#glos_table).

option
:   A configuration parameter for MySQL, either stored in the
    **option file** or passed on the
    command line.

    For the **options** that apply to
    **InnoDB** tables, each option name
    starts with the prefix `innodb_`.

    See Also [InnoDB](glossary.md#glos_innodb), [option](glossary.md#glos_option), [option file](glossary.md#glos_option_file).

option file
:   The file that holds the configuration
    **options** for the MySQL instance.
    Traditionally, on Linux and Unix this file is named
    `my.cnf`, and on Windows it is named
    `my.ini`.

    See Also [configuration file](glossary.md#glos_configuration_file), [my.cnf](glossary.md#glos_my_cnf), [my.ini](glossary.md#glos_my_ini), [option](glossary.md#glos_option).

overflow page
:   Separately allocated disk **pages**
    that hold variable-length columns (such as
    `BLOB` and `VARCHAR`) that are
    too long to fit on a **B-tree**
    page. The associated columns are known as
    **off-page columns**.

    See Also [B-tree](glossary.md#glos_b_tree), [off-page column](glossary.md#glos_off_page_column), [page](glossary.md#glos_page).

### P

.par file
:   A file containing partition definitions. Files with this
    extension are included in backups produced by the
    `mysqlbackup` command of the
    **MySQL Enterprise Backup** product.

    With the introduction of native partitioning support for
    `InnoDB` tables in MySQL 5.7.6,
    `.par` files are no longer created for
    partitioned `InnoDB` tables. Partitioned
    `MyISAM` tables continue to use
    `.par` files in MySQL 5.7. In MySQL 8.0,
    partitioning support is only provided by the
    `InnoDB` storage engine. As such,
    `.par` files are no longer used as of MySQL
    8.0.

    See Also [MySQL Enterprise Backup](glossary.md#glos_mysql_enterprise_backup), [mysqlbackup command](glossary.md#glos_mysqlbackup_command).

page
:   A unit representing how much data `InnoDB`
    transfers at any one time between disk (the
    **data files**) and memory (the
    **buffer pool**). A page can
    contain one or more **rows**,
    depending on how much data is in each row. If a row does not fit
    entirely into a single page, `InnoDB` sets up
    additional pointer-style data structures so that the information
    about the row can be stored in one page.

    One way to fit more data in each page is to use
    **compressed row format**. For
    tables that use BLOBs or large text fields,
    **compact row format** allows those
    large columns to be stored separately from the rest of the row,
    reducing I/O overhead and memory usage for queries that do not
    reference those columns.

    When `InnoDB` reads or writes sets of pages as
    a batch to increase I/O throughput, it reads or writes an
    **extent** at a time.

    All the `InnoDB` disk data structures within a
    MySQL instance share the same **page
    size**.

    See Also [buffer pool](glossary.md#glos_buffer_pool), [compact row format](glossary.md#glos_compact_row_format), [compressed row format](glossary.md#glos_compressed_row_format), [data files](glossary.md#glos_data_files), [extent](glossary.md#glos_extent), [page size](glossary.md#glos_page_size), [row](glossary.md#glos_row).

page cleaner
:   An `InnoDB` background
    **thread** that
    **flushes**
    **dirty pages** from the
    **buffer pool**. Prior to MySQL
    5.6, this activity was performed by the
    **master thread**. The number of
    page cleaner threads is controlled by the
    [`innodb_page_cleaners`](innodb-parameters.md#sysvar_innodb_page_cleaners)
    configuration option, introduced in MySQL 5.7.4.

    See Also [buffer pool](glossary.md#glos_buffer_pool), [dirty page](glossary.md#glos_dirty_page), [flush](glossary.md#glos_flush), [master thread](glossary.md#glos_master_thread), [thread](glossary.md#glos_thread).

page size
:   For releases up to and including MySQL 5.5, the size of each
    `InnoDB` **page**
    is fixed at 16 kilobytes. This value represents a balance: large
    enough to hold the data for most rows, yet small enough to
    minimize the performance overhead of transferring unneeded data
    to memory. Other values are not tested or supported.

    Starting in MySQL 5.6, the page size for an
    `InnoDB`
    **instance** can be either 4KB,
    8KB, or 16KB, controlled by the
    [`innodb_page_size`](innodb-parameters.md#sysvar_innodb_page_size) configuration
    option. As of MySQL 5.7.6, `InnoDB` also
    supports 32KB and 64KB page sizes. For 32KB and 64KB page sizes,
    `ROW_FORMAT=COMPRESSED` is not supported and
    the maximum record size is 16KB.

    Page size is set when creating the MySQL instance, and it
    remains constant afterward. The same page size applies to all
    `InnoDB`
    **tablespaces**, including the
    **system tablespace**,
    **file-per-table** tablespaces, and
    **general tablespaces**.

    Smaller page sizes can help performance with storage devices
    that use small block sizes, particularly for
    **SSD** devices in
    **disk-bound** workloads, such as
    for **OLTP** applications. As
    individual rows are updated, less data is copied into memory,
    written to disk, reorganized, locked, and so on.

    See Also [disk-bound](glossary.md#glos_disk_bound), [file-per-table](glossary.md#glos_file_per_table), [general tablespace](glossary.md#glos_general_tablespace), [instance](glossary.md#glos_instance), [OLTP](glossary.md#glos_oltp), [page](glossary.md#glos_page), [SSD](glossary.md#glos_ssd), [system tablespace](glossary.md#glos_system_tablespace), [tablespace](glossary.md#glos_tablespace).

parent table
:   The table in a **foreign key**
    relationship that holds the initial column values pointed to
    from the **child table**. The
    consequences of deleting, or updating rows in the parent table
    depend on the `ON UPDATE` and `ON
    DELETE` clauses in the foreign key definition. Rows
    with corresponding values in the child table could be
    automatically deleted or updated in turn, or those columns could
    be set to `NULL`, or the operation could be
    prevented.

    See Also [child table](glossary.md#glos_child_table), [foreign key](glossary.md#glos_foreign_key).

partial backup
:   A **backup** that contains some of
    the **tables** in a MySQL database,
    or some of the databases in a MySQL instance. Contrast with
    **full backup**.

    See Also [backup](glossary.md#glos_backup), [full backup](glossary.md#glos_full_backup), [table](glossary.md#glos_table).

partial index
:   An **index** that represents only
    part of a column value, typically the first N characters (the
    **prefix**) of a long
    `VARCHAR` value.

    See Also [index](glossary.md#glos_index), [index prefix](glossary.md#glos_index_prefix).

partial trust
:   An execution environment typically used by hosting providers,
    where applications have some permissions but not others. For
    example, applications might be able to access a database server
    over a network, but be “sandboxed” with regard to
    reading and writing local files.

    See Also [Connector/NET](glossary.md#glos_connector_net).

Performance Schema
:   The `performance_schema` schema, in MySQL 5.5
    and up, presents a set of tables that you can query to get
    detailed information about the performance characteristics of
    many internal parts of the MySQL server. See
    [Chapter 29, *MySQL Performance Schema*](performance-schema.md "Chapter 29 MySQL Performance Schema").

    See Also [INFORMATION\_SCHEMA](glossary.md#glos_information_schema), [latch](glossary.md#glos_latch), [mutex](glossary.md#glos_mutex), [rw-lock](glossary.md#glos_rw_lock).

Perl
:   A programming language with roots in Unix scripting and report
    generation. Incorporates high-performance regular expressions
    and file I/O. Large collection of reusable modules available
    through repositories such as CPAN.

    See Also [Perl API](glossary.md#glos_perl_api).

Perl API
:   An open-source **API** for MySQL
    applications written in the
    **Perl** language. Implemented
    through the `DBI` and
    `DBD::mysql` modules. For details, see
    [Section 31.9, “MySQL Perl API”](apis-perl.md "31.9 MySQL Perl API").

    See Also [API](glossary.md#glos_api), [Perl](glossary.md#glos_perl).

persistent statistics
:   A feature that stores **index**
    statistics for `InnoDB`
    **tables** on disk, providing
    better **plan stability** for
    **queries**. For more information,
    see [Section 17.8.10.1, “Configuring Persistent Optimizer Statistics Parameters”](innodb-persistent-stats.md "17.8.10.1 Configuring Persistent Optimizer Statistics Parameters").

    See Also [index](glossary.md#glos_index), [optimizer](glossary.md#glos_optimizer), [plan stability](glossary.md#glos_plan_stability), [query](glossary.md#glos_query), [table](glossary.md#glos_table).

pessimistic
:   A methodology that sacrifices performance or concurrency in
    favor of safety. It is appropriate if a high proportion of
    requests or attempts might fail, or if the consequences of a
    failed request are severe. `InnoDB` uses what
    is known as a pessimistic
    **locking** strategy, to minimize
    the chance of **deadlocks**. At the
    application level, you might avoid deadlocks by using a
    pessimistic strategy of acquiring all locks needed by a
    transaction at the very beginning.

    Many built-in database mechanisms use the opposite
    **optimistic** methodology.

    See Also [deadlock](glossary.md#glos_deadlock), [locking](glossary.md#glos_locking), [optimistic](glossary.md#glos_optimistic).

phantom
:   A row that appears in the result set of a query, but not in the
    result set of an earlier query. For example, if a query is run
    twice within a **transaction**, and
    in the meantime, another transaction commits after inserting a
    new row or updating a row so that it matches the
    `WHERE` clause of the query.

    This occurrence is known as a phantom read. It is harder to
    guard against than a **non-repeatable
    read**, because locking all the rows from the first
    query result set does not prevent the changes that cause the
    phantom to appear.

    Among different **isolation
    levels**, phantom reads are prevented by the
    **serializable read** level, and
    allowed by the **repeatable read**,
    **consistent read**, and
    **read uncommitted** levels.

    See Also [consistent read](glossary.md#glos_consistent_read), [isolation level](glossary.md#glos_isolation_level), [non-repeatable read](glossary.md#glos_non_repeatable_read), [READ UNCOMMITTED](glossary.md#glos_read_uncommitted), [REPEATABLE READ](glossary.md#glos_repeatable_read), [SERIALIZABLE](glossary.md#glos_serializable), [transaction](glossary.md#glos_transaction).

PHP
:   A programming language originating with web applications. The
    code is typically embedded as blocks within the source of a web
    page, with the output substituted into the page as it is
    transmitted by the web server. This is in contrast to
    applications such as CGI scripts that print output in the form
    of an entire web page. The PHP style of coding is used for
    highly interactive and dynamic web pages. Modern PHP programs
    can also be run as command-line or GUI applications.

    MySQL applications are written using one of the
    **PHP APIs**. Reusable modules can
    be written in **C** and called from
    PHP.

    Another technology for writing server-side web pages with MySQL
    is **ASP.net**.

    See Also [ASP.net](glossary.md#glos_asp_net), [C](glossary.md#glos_c), [PHP API](glossary.md#glos_php_api).

PHP API
:   Several **APIs** are available for
    writing MySQL applications in the
    **PHP** language: the original
    MySQL API (`Mysql`) the MySQL Improved
    Extension (`Mysqli`) the MySQL Native Driver
    (`Mysqlnd`) the MySQL functions
    (`PDO_MYSQL`), and Connector/PHP. For details,
    see [MySQL and PHP](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/apis-php/en/).

    See Also [API](glossary.md#glos_api), [PHP](glossary.md#glos_php).

physical
:   A type of operation that involves hardware-related aspects such
    as disk blocks, memory pages, files, bits, disk reads, and so
    on. Typically, physical aspects are important during
    expert-level performance tuning and problem diagnosis. Contrast
    with **logical**.

    See Also [logical](glossary.md#glos_logical), [physical backup](glossary.md#glos_physical_backup).

physical backup
:   A **backup** that copies the actual
    data files. For example, the
    **`mysqlbackup`**
    command of the **MySQL Enterprise Backup** product
    produces a physical backup, because its output contains data
    files that can be used directly by the `mysqld`
    server, resulting in a faster
    **restore** operation. Contrast
    with **logical backup**.

    See Also [backup](glossary.md#glos_backup), [logical backup](glossary.md#glos_logical_backup), [MySQL Enterprise Backup](glossary.md#glos_mysql_enterprise_backup), [restore](glossary.md#glos_restore).

PITR
:   Acronym for **point-in-time
    recovery**.

    See Also [point-in-time recovery](glossary.md#glos_point_in_time_recovery).

plan stability
:   A property of a **query execution
    plan**, where the optimizer makes the same choices each
    time for a given **query**, so that
    performance is consistent and predictable.

    See Also [query](glossary.md#glos_query), [query execution plan](glossary.md#glos_query_execution_plan).

point-in-time recovery
:   The process of restoring a
    **backup** to recreate the state of
    the database at a specific date and time. Commonly abbreviated
    “PITR”. Because it is unlikely that the specified
    time corresponds exactly to the time of a backup, this technique
    usually requires a combination of a
    **physical backup** and a
    **logical backup**. For example,
    with the **MySQL Enterprise Backup** product, you
    restore the last backup that you took before the specified point
    in time, then replay changes from the
    **binary log** between the time of
    the backup and the PITR time.

    See Also [backup](glossary.md#glos_backup), [binary log](glossary.md#glos_binary_log), [logical backup](glossary.md#glos_logical_backup), [MySQL Enterprise Backup](glossary.md#glos_mysql_enterprise_backup), [physical backup](glossary.md#glos_physical_backup).

port
:   The number of the TCP/IP socket the database server listens on,
    used to establish a **connection**.
    Often specified in conjunction with a
    **host**. Depending on your use of
    network encryption, there might be one port for unencrypted
    traffic and another port for
    **SSL** connections.

    See Also [connection](glossary.md#glos_connection), [host](glossary.md#glos_host), [SSL](glossary.md#glos_ssl).

prefix
:   See [index prefix](glossary.md#glos_index_prefix).

prepared backup
:   A set of backup files, produced by the
    **MySQL Enterprise Backup** product, after all the
    stages of applying **binary logs**
    and **incremental backups** are
    finished. The resulting files are ready to be
    **restored**. Prior to the apply
    steps, the files are known as a **raw
    backup**.

    See Also [binary log](glossary.md#glos_binary_log), [hot backup](glossary.md#glos_hot_backup), [incremental backup](glossary.md#glos_incremental_backup), [MySQL Enterprise Backup](glossary.md#glos_mysql_enterprise_backup), [raw backup](glossary.md#glos_raw_backup), [restore](glossary.md#glos_restore).

prepared statement
:   An SQL statement that is analyzed in advance to determine an
    efficient execution plan. It can be executed multiple times,
    without the overhead for parsing and analysis each time.
    Different values can be substituted for literals in the
    `WHERE` clause each time, through the use of
    placeholders. This substitution technique improves security,
    protecting against some kinds of SQL injection attacks. You can
    also reduce the overhead for converting and copying return
    values to program variables.

    Although you can use prepared statements directly through SQL
    syntax, the various **Connectors**
    have programming interfaces for manipulating prepared
    statements, and these APIs are more efficient than going through
    SQL.

    See Also [client-side prepared statement](glossary.md#glos_client_side_prepared_statement), [connector](glossary.md#glos_connector), [server-side prepared statement](glossary.md#glos_server_side_prepared_statement).

primary key
:   A set of columns—and by implication, the index based on
    this set of columns—that can uniquely identify every row
    in a table. As such, it must be a unique index that does not
    contain any `NULL` values.

    `InnoDB` requires that every table has such an
    index (also called the **clustered
    index** or **cluster
    index**), and organizes the table storage based on the
    column values of the primary key.

    When choosing primary key values, consider using arbitrary
    values (a **synthetic key**) rather
    than relying on values derived from some other source (a
    **natural key**).

    See Also [clustered index](glossary.md#glos_clustered_index), [index](glossary.md#glos_index), [natural key](glossary.md#glos_natural_key), [synthetic key](glossary.md#glos_synthetic_key).

principal
:   The Kerberos term for a named entity, such as a user or server.

    See Also [service principal name](glossary.md#glos_service_principal_name), [user principal name](glossary.md#glos_user_principal_name).

process
:   An instance of an executing program. The operating system
    switches between multiple running processes, allowing for a
    certain degree of **concurrency**.
    On most operating systems, processes can contain multiple
    **threads** of execution that share
    resources. Context-switching between threads is faster than the
    equivalent switching between processes.

    See Also [concurrency](glossary.md#glos_concurrency), [thread](glossary.md#glos_thread).

pseudo-record
:   An artificial record in an index, used for
    **locking** key values or ranges
    that do not currently exist.

    See Also [infimum record](glossary.md#glos_infimum_record), [locking](glossary.md#glos_locking), [supremum record](glossary.md#glos_supremum_record).

Pthreads
:   The POSIX threads standard, which defines an API for threading
    and locking operations on Unix and Linux systems. On Unix and
    Linux systems, `InnoDB` uses this
    implementation for **mutexes**.

    See Also [mutex](glossary.md#glos_mutex).

purge
:   A type of garbage collection performed by one or more separate
    background threads (controlled by
    [`innodb_purge_threads`](innodb-parameters.md#sysvar_innodb_purge_threads)) that runs
    on a periodic schedule. Purge parses and processes
    **undo log** pages from the
    **history list** for the purpose of
    removing clustered and secondary index records that were marked
    for deletion (by previous [`DELETE`](delete.md "15.2.2 DELETE Statement")
    statements) and are no longer required for
    **MVCC** or
    **rollback**. Purge frees undo log
    pages from the history list after processing them.

    See Also [history list](glossary.md#glos_history_list), [MVCC](glossary.md#glos_mvcc), [rollback](glossary.md#glos_rollback), [undo log](glossary.md#glos_undo_log).

purge buffering
:   The technique of storing changes to secondary index pages,
    resulting from `DELETE` operations, in the
    **change buffer** rather than
    writing the changes immediately, so that the physical writes can
    be performed to minimize random I/O. (Because delete operations
    are a two-step process, this operation buffers the write that
    normally purges an index record that was previously marked for
    deletion.) It is one of the types of
    **change buffering**; the others
    are **insert buffering** and
    **delete buffering**.

    See Also [change buffer](glossary.md#glos_change_buffer), [change buffering](glossary.md#glos_change_buffering), [delete buffering](glossary.md#glos_delete_buffering), [insert buffer](glossary.md#glos_insert_buffer), [insert buffering](glossary.md#glos_insert_buffering).

purge lag
:   Another name for the `InnoDB`
    **history list**. Related to the
    [`innodb_max_purge_lag`](innodb-parameters.md#sysvar_innodb_max_purge_lag)
    configuration option.

    See Also [history list](glossary.md#glos_history_list), [purge](glossary.md#glos_purge).

purge thread
:   A **thread** within the
    `InnoDB` process that is dedicated to
    performing the periodic **purge**
    operation. In MySQL 5.6 and higher, multiple purge threads are
    enabled by the
    [`innodb_purge_threads`](innodb-parameters.md#sysvar_innodb_purge_threads)
    configuration option.

    See Also [purge](glossary.md#glos_purge), [thread](glossary.md#glos_thread).

Python
:   A programming language used in a broad range of fields, from
    Unix scripting to large-scale applications. Includes runtime
    typing, built-in high-level data types, object-oriented
    features, and an extensive standard library. Often used as a
    “glue” language between components written in other
    languages. The MySQL **Python API**
    is the open-source **MySQLdb**
    module.

    See Also [MySQLdb](glossary.md#glos_mysqldb), [Python API](glossary.md#glos_python_api).

Python API
:   See Also [API](glossary.md#glos_api), [Python](glossary.md#glos_python).

### Q

query
:   In **SQL**, an operation that reads
    information from one or more
    **tables**. Depending on the
    organization of data and the parameters of the query, the lookup
    might be optimized by consulting an
    **index**. If multiple tables are
    involved, the query is known as a
    **join**.

    For historical reasons, sometimes discussions of internal
    processing for statements use “query” in a broader
    sense, including other types of MySQL statements such as
    **DDL** and
    **DML** statements.

    See Also [DDL](glossary.md#glos_ddl), [DML](glossary.md#glos_dml), [index](glossary.md#glos_index), [join](glossary.md#glos_join), [SQL](glossary.md#glos_sql), [table](glossary.md#glos_table).

query execution plan
:   The set of decisions made by the optimizer about how to perform
    a **query** most efficiently,
    including which **index** or
    indexes to use, and the order in which to
    **join** tables.
    **Plan stability** involves the
    same choices being made consistently for a given query.

    See Also [index](glossary.md#glos_index), [join](glossary.md#glos_join), [plan stability](glossary.md#glos_plan_stability), [query](glossary.md#glos_query).

query log
:   See [general query log](glossary.md#glos_general_query_log).

quiesce
:   To reduce the amount of database activity, often in preparation
    for an operation such as an [`ALTER
    TABLE`](alter-table.md "15.1.9 ALTER TABLE Statement"), a **backup**, or a
    **shutdown**. Might or might not
    involve doing as much **flushing**
    as possible, so that **InnoDB**
    does not continue doing background I/O.

    In MySQL 5.6 and higher, the syntax `FLUSH TABLES ...
    FOR EXPORT` writes some data to disk for
    `InnoDB` tables that make it simpler to back up
    those tables by copying the data files.

    See Also [backup](glossary.md#glos_backup), [flush](glossary.md#glos_flush), [InnoDB](glossary.md#glos_innodb), [shutdown](glossary.md#glos_shutdown).

### R

R-tree
:   A tree data structure used for spatial indexing of
    multi-dimensional data such as geographical coordinates,
    rectangles or polygons.

    See Also [B-tree](glossary.md#glos_b_tree).

RAID
:   Acronym for “Redundant Array of Inexpensive
    Drives”. Spreading I/O operations across multiple drives
    enables greater **concurrency** at
    the hardware level, and improves the efficiency of low-level
    write operations that otherwise would be performed in sequence.

    See Also [concurrency](glossary.md#glos_concurrency).

random dive
:   A technique for quickly estimating the number of different
    values in a column (the column's
    **cardinality**).
    `InnoDB` samples pages at random from the index
    and uses that data to estimate the number of different values.

    See Also [cardinality](glossary.md#glos_cardinality).

raw backup
:   The initial set of backup files produced by the
    **MySQL Enterprise Backup** product, before the
    changes reflected in the **binary
    log** and any **incremental
    backups** are applied. At this stage, the files are not
    ready to **restore**. After these
    changes are applied, the files are known as a
    **prepared backup**.

    See Also [binary log](glossary.md#glos_binary_log), [hot backup](glossary.md#glos_hot_backup), [ibbackup\_logfile](glossary.md#glos_ibbackup_logfile), [incremental backup](glossary.md#glos_incremental_backup), [MySQL Enterprise Backup](glossary.md#glos_mysql_enterprise_backup), [prepared backup](glossary.md#glos_prepared_backup), [restore](glossary.md#glos_restore).

READ COMMITTED
:   An **isolation level** that uses a
    **locking** strategy that relaxes
    some of the protection between
    **transactions**, in the interest
    of performance. Transactions cannot see uncommitted data from
    other transactions, but they can see data that is committed by
    another transaction after the current transaction started. Thus,
    a transaction never sees any bad data, but the data that it does
    see may depend to some extent on the timing of other
    transactions.

    When a transaction with this isolation level performs
    `UPDATE ... WHERE` or `DELETE ...
    WHERE` operations, other transactions might have to
    wait. The transaction can perform `SELECT ... FOR
    UPDATE`, and `LOCK IN SHARE MODE`
    operations without making other transactions wait.

    `SELECT ... FOR SHARE` replaces `SELECT
    ... LOCK IN SHARE MODE` in MySQL 8.0.1, but
    `LOCK IN SHARE MODE` remains available for
    backward compatibility.

    See Also [ACID](glossary.md#glos_acid), [isolation level](glossary.md#glos_isolation_level), [locking](glossary.md#glos_locking), [REPEATABLE READ](glossary.md#glos_repeatable_read), [SERIALIZABLE](glossary.md#glos_serializable), [transaction](glossary.md#glos_transaction).

read phenomena
:   Phenomena such as **dirty reads**,
    **non-repeatable reads**, and
    **phantom** reads which can occur
    when a transaction reads data that another transaction has
    modified.

    See Also [dirty read](glossary.md#glos_dirty_read), [non-repeatable read](glossary.md#glos_non_repeatable_read), [phantom](glossary.md#glos_phantom).

READ UNCOMMITTED
:   The **isolation level** that
    provides the least amount of protection between transactions.
    Queries employ a **locking**
    strategy that allows them to proceed in situations where they
    would normally wait for another transaction. However, this extra
    performance comes at the cost of less reliable results,
    including data that has been changed by other transactions and
    not committed yet (known as **dirty
    read**). Use this isolation level with great caution,
    and be aware that the results might not be consistent or
    reproducible, depending on what other transactions are doing at
    the same time. Typically, transactions with this isolation level
    only do queries, not insert, update, or delete operations.

    See Also [ACID](glossary.md#glos_acid), [dirty read](glossary.md#glos_dirty_read), [isolation level](glossary.md#glos_isolation_level), [locking](glossary.md#glos_locking), [transaction](glossary.md#glos_transaction).

read view
:   An internal snapshot used by the
    **MVCC** mechanism of
    `InnoDB`. Certain
    **transactions**, depending on
    their **isolation level**, see the
    data values as they were at the time the transaction (or in some
    cases, the statement) started. Isolation levels that use a read
    view are **REPEATABLE READ**,
    **READ COMMITTED**, and
    **READ UNCOMMITTED**.

    See Also [isolation level](glossary.md#glos_isolation_level), [MVCC](glossary.md#glos_mvcc), [READ COMMITTED](glossary.md#glos_read_committed), [READ UNCOMMITTED](glossary.md#glos_read_uncommitted), [REPEATABLE READ](glossary.md#glos_repeatable_read), [transaction](glossary.md#glos_transaction).

read-ahead
:   A type of I/O request that prefetches a group of
    **pages** (an entire
    **extent**) into the
    **buffer pool** asynchronously, in
    case these pages are needed soon. The linear read-ahead
    technique prefetches all the pages of one extent based on access
    patterns for pages in the preceding extent. The random
    read-ahead technique prefetches all the pages for an extent once
    a certain number of pages from the same extent are in the buffer
    pool. Random read-ahead is not part of MySQL 5.5, but is
    re-introduced in MySQL 5.6 under the control of the
    [`innodb_random_read_ahead`](innodb-parameters.md#sysvar_innodb_random_read_ahead)
    configuration option.

    See Also [buffer pool](glossary.md#glos_buffer_pool), [extent](glossary.md#glos_extent), [page](glossary.md#glos_page).

read-only transaction
:   A type of **transaction** that can
    be optimized for `InnoDB` tables by eliminating
    some of the bookkeeping involved with creating a
    **read view** for each transaction.
    Can only perform **non-locking
    read** queries. It can be started explicitly with the
    syntax [`START TRANSACTION
    READ ONLY`](commit.md "15.3.1 START TRANSACTION, COMMIT, and ROLLBACK Statements"), or automatically under certain conditions.
    See [Section 10.5.3, “Optimizing InnoDB Read-Only Transactions”](innodb-performance-ro-txn.md "10.5.3 Optimizing InnoDB Read-Only Transactions") for details.

    See Also [non-locking read](glossary.md#glos_non_locking_read), [read view](glossary.md#glos_read_view), [transaction](glossary.md#glos_transaction).

record lock
:   A [lock](glossary.md#glos_lock "lock") on an index record. For
    example, `SELECT c1 FROM t WHERE c1 = 10 FOR
    UPDATE;` prevents any other transaction from inserting,
    updating, or deleting rows where the value of
    `t.c1` is 10. Contrast with
    **gap lock** and
    **next-key lock**.

    See Also [gap lock](glossary.md#glos_gap_lock), [lock](glossary.md#glos_lock), [next-key lock](glossary.md#glos_next_key_lock).

redo
:   The data, in units of records, recorded in the
    **redo log** when
    [DML](glossary.md#glos_dml "DML") statements make changes to
    `InnoDB` tables. It is used during
    **crash recovery** to correct data
    written by incomplete
    **transactions**. The
    ever-increasing **LSN** value
    represents the cumulative amount of redo data that has passed
    through the redo log.

    See Also [crash recovery](glossary.md#glos_crash_recovery), [DML](glossary.md#glos_dml), [LSN](glossary.md#glos_lsn), [redo log](glossary.md#glos_redo_log), [transaction](glossary.md#glos_transaction).

redo log
:   A disk-based data structure used during
    **crash recovery**, to correct data
    written by incomplete
    **transactions**. During normal
    operation, it encodes requests to change
    `InnoDB` table data, which result from SQL
    statements or low-level API calls. Modifications that did not
    finish updating the **data files**
    before an unexpected **shutdown**
    are replayed automatically.

    The redo log is physically represented on disk as a set of redo
    log files. Redo log data is encoded in terms of records
    affected; this data is collectively referred to as
    **redo**. The passage of data
    through the redo log is represented by an ever-increasing
    **LSN** value.

    For more information, see [Section 17.6.5, “Redo Log”](innodb-redo-log.md "17.6.5 Redo Log")

    See Also [crash recovery](glossary.md#glos_crash_recovery), [data files](glossary.md#glos_data_files), [ib\_logfile](glossary.md#glos_ib_logfile), [log buffer](glossary.md#glos_log_buffer), [LSN](glossary.md#glos_lsn), [redo](glossary.md#glos_redo), [shutdown](glossary.md#glos_shutdown), [transaction](glossary.md#glos_transaction).

redo log archiving
:   An `InnoDB` feature that, when enabled,
    sequentially writes redo log records to an archive file to avoid
    potential loss of data than can occur when a backup utility
    fails to keep pace with redo log generation while a backup
    operation is in progress. For more information, see
    [Redo Log Archiving](innodb-redo-log.md#innodb-redo-log-archiving "Redo Log Archiving").

    See Also [redo log](glossary.md#glos_redo_log).

redundant row format
:   The oldest `InnoDB` **row
    format**. Prior to MySQL 5.0.3, it was the only row
    format available in `InnoDB`. From MySQL 5.0.3
    to MySQL 5.7.8, the default row format is
    **COMPACT**. As of MySQL 5.7.9, the
    default row format is defined by the
    [`innodb_default_row_format`](innodb-parameters.md#sysvar_innodb_default_row_format)
    configuration option, which has a default setting of
    **DYNAMIC**. You can still specify
    the **REDUNDANT** row format for
    compatibility with older `InnoDB` tables.

    For more information, see [Section 17.10, “InnoDB Row Formats”](innodb-row-format.md "17.10 InnoDB Row Formats").

    See Also [compact row format](glossary.md#glos_compact_row_format), [dynamic row format](glossary.md#glos_dynamic_row_format), [row format](glossary.md#glos_row_format).

referential integrity
:   The technique of maintaining data always in a consistent format,
    part of the **ACID** philosophy. In
    particular, data in different tables is kept consistent through
    the use of **foreign key
    constraints**, which can prevent changes from happening
    or automatically propagate those changes to all related tables.
    Related mechanisms include the **unique
    constraint**, which prevents duplicate values from
    being inserted by mistake, and the **NOT
    NULL constraint**, which prevents blank values from
    being inserted by mistake.

    See Also [ACID](glossary.md#glos_acid), [FOREIGN KEY constraint](glossary.md#glos_foreign_key_constraint), [NOT NULL constraint](glossary.md#glos_not_null_constraint), [unique constraint](glossary.md#glos_unique_constraint).

relational
:   An important aspect of modern database systems. The database
    server encodes and enforces relationships such as one-to-one,
    one-to-many, many-to-one, and uniqueness. For example, a person
    might have zero, one, or many phone numbers in an address
    database; a single phone number might be associated with several
    family members. In a financial database, a person might be
    required to have exactly one taxpayer ID, and any taxpayer ID
    could only be associated with one person.

    The database server can use these relationships to prevent bad
    data from being inserted, and to find efficient ways to look up
    information. For example, if a value is declared to be unique,
    the server can stop searching as soon as the first match is
    found, and it can reject attempts to insert a second copy of the
    same value.

    At the database level, these relationships are expressed through
    SQL features such as **columns**
    within a table, unique and `NOT NULL`
    **constraints**,
    **foreign keys**, and different
    kinds of join operations. Complex relationships typically
    involve data split between more than one table. Often, the data
    is **normalized**, so that
    duplicate values in one-to-many relationships are stored only
    once.

    In a mathematical context, the relations within a database are
    derived from set theory. For example, the `OR`
    and `AND` operators of a
    `WHERE` clause represent the notions of union
    and intersection.

    See Also [ACID](glossary.md#glos_acid), [column](glossary.md#glos_column), [constraint](glossary.md#glos_constraint), [foreign key](glossary.md#glos_foreign_key), [normalized](glossary.md#glos_normalized).

relevance
:   In the **full-text search**
    feature, a number signifying the similarity between the search
    string and the data in the **FULLTEXT
    index**. For example, when you search for a single
    word, that word is typically more relevant for a row where it
    occurs several times in the text than a row where it appears
    only once.

    See Also [full-text search](glossary.md#glos_full_text_search), [FULLTEXT index](glossary.md#glos_fulltext_index).

REPEATABLE READ
:   The default **isolation level** for
    `InnoDB`. It prevents any rows that are queried
    from being changed by other
    **transactions**, thus blocking
    **non-repeatable reads** but not
    **phantom** reads. It uses a
    moderately strict **locking**
    strategy so that all queries within a transaction see data from
    the same snapshot, that is, the data as it was at the time the
    transaction started.

    When a transaction with this isolation level performs
    `UPDATE ... WHERE`, `DELETE ...
    WHERE`, `SELECT ... FOR UPDATE`, and
    `LOCK IN SHARE MODE` operations, other
    transactions might have to wait.

    `SELECT ... FOR SHARE` replaces `SELECT
    ... LOCK IN SHARE MODE` in MySQL 8.0.1, but
    `LOCK IN SHARE MODE` remains available for
    backward compatibility.

    See Also [ACID](glossary.md#glos_acid), [consistent read](glossary.md#glos_consistent_read), [isolation level](glossary.md#glos_isolation_level), [locking](glossary.md#glos_locking), [phantom](glossary.md#glos_phantom), [transaction](glossary.md#glos_transaction).

repertoire
:   Repertoire is a term applied to character sets. A character set
    repertoire is the collection of characters in the set. See
    [Section 12.2.1, “Character Set Repertoire”](charset-repertoire.md "12.2.1 Character Set Repertoire").

replica
:   A database **server** machine in a
    **replication** topology that
    receives changes from another server (the
    **source**) and applies those same
    changes. Thus it maintains the same contents as the source,
    although it might lag somewhat behind.

    In MySQL, replicas are commonly used in disaster recovery, to
    take the place of a source that fails. They are also commonly
    used for testing software upgrades and new settings, to ensure
    that database configuration changes do not cause problems with
    performance or reliability.

    Replicas typically have high workloads, because they process all
    the **DML** (write) operations
    relayed from the source, as well as user queries. To ensure that
    replicas can apply changes from the source fast enough, they
    frequently have fast I/O devices and sufficient CPU and memory
    to run multiple database instances on the same server. For
    example, the source might use hard drive storage while the
    replicas use **SSD**s.

    See Also [DML](glossary.md#glos_dml), [replication](glossary.md#glos_replication), [server](glossary.md#glos_server), [source](glossary.md#glos_source), [SSD](glossary.md#glos_ssd).

replication
:   The practice of sending changes from a
    **source**, to one or more
    **replicas**, so that all databases
    have the same data. This technique has a wide range of uses,
    such as load-balancing for better scalability, disaster
    recovery, and testing software upgrades and configuration
    changes. The changes can be sent between the databases by
    methods called **row-based
    replication** and **statement-based
    replication**.

    See Also [replica](glossary.md#glos_replica), [row-based replication](glossary.md#glos_row_based_replication), [source](glossary.md#glos_source), [statement-based replication](glossary.md#glos_statement_based_replication).

restore
:   The process of putting a set of backup files from the
    **MySQL Enterprise Backup** product in place for use
    by MySQL. This operation can be performed to fix a corrupted
    database, to return to some earlier point in time, or (in a
    **replication** context) to set up
    a new **replica**. In the
    **MySQL Enterprise Backup** product, this operation
    is performed by the `copy-back` option of the
    `mysqlbackup` command.

    See Also [hot backup](glossary.md#glos_hot_backup), [MySQL Enterprise Backup](glossary.md#glos_mysql_enterprise_backup), [mysqlbackup command](glossary.md#glos_mysqlbackup_command), [prepared backup](glossary.md#glos_prepared_backup), [replica](glossary.md#glos_replica), [replication](glossary.md#glos_replication).

rollback
:   A **SQL** statement that ends a
    **transaction**, undoing any
    changes made by the transaction. It is the opposite of
    **commit**, which makes permanent
    any changes made in the transaction.

    By default, MySQL uses the
    **autocommit** setting, which
    automatically issues a commit following each SQL statement. You
    must change this setting before you can use the rollback
    technique.

    See Also [ACID](glossary.md#glos_acid), [autocommit](glossary.md#glos_autocommit), [commit](glossary.md#glos_commit), [SQL](glossary.md#glos_sql), [transaction](glossary.md#glos_transaction).

rollback segment
:   The storage area containing the **undo
    logs**. Rollback segments have traditionally resided in
    the **system tablespace**. As of
    MySQL 5.6, rollback segments can reside in
    **undo tablespaces**. As of MySQL
    5.7, rollback segments are also allocated to the
    *global temporary tablespace*.

    See Also [global temporary tablespace](glossary.md#glos_global_temporary_tablespace), [system tablespace](glossary.md#glos_system_tablespace), [undo log](glossary.md#glos_undo_log), [undo tablespace](glossary.md#glos_undo_tablespace).

row
:   The logical data structure defined by a set of
    **columns**. A set of rows makes up
    a **table**. Within
    `InnoDB` **data
    files**, each **page** can
    contain one or more rows.

    Although `InnoDB` uses the term
    **row format** for consistency with
    MySQL syntax, the row format is a property of each table and
    applies to all rows in that table.

    See Also [column](glossary.md#glos_column), [data files](glossary.md#glos_data_files), [page](glossary.md#glos_page), [row format](glossary.md#glos_row_format), [table](glossary.md#glos_table).

row format
:   The disk storage format for
    **rows** of an
    `InnoDB`
    **table**. As
    `InnoDB` gains new capabilities such as
    **compression**, new row formats
    are introduced to support the resulting improvements in storage
    efficiency and performance.

    The row format of an `InnoDB` table is
    specified by the `ROW_FORMAT` option or by the
    [`innodb_default_row_format`](innodb-parameters.md#sysvar_innodb_default_row_format)
    configuration option (introduced in MySQL 5.7.9). Row formats
    include `REDUNDANT`,
    `COMPACT`, `COMPRESSED`, and
    `DYNAMIC`. To view the row format of an
    `InnoDB` table, issue the
    [`SHOW TABLE STATUS`](show-table-status.md "15.7.7.38 SHOW TABLE STATUS Statement") statement or
    query `InnoDB` table metadata in the
    [`INFORMATION_SCHEMA`](information-schema.md "Chapter 28 INFORMATION_SCHEMA Tables").

    See Also [compact row format](glossary.md#glos_compact_row_format), [compressed row format](glossary.md#glos_compressed_row_format), [compression](glossary.md#glos_compression), [dynamic row format](glossary.md#glos_dynamic_row_format), [redundant row format](glossary.md#glos_redundant_row_format), [row](glossary.md#glos_row), [table](glossary.md#glos_table).

row lock
:   A **lock** that prevents a row from
    being accessed in an incompatible way by another
    **transaction**. Other rows in the
    same table can be freely written to by other transactions. This
    is the type of **locking** done by
    **DML** operations on
    **InnoDB** tables.

    Contrast with **table locks** used
    by [`MyISAM`](myisam-storage-engine.md "18.2 The MyISAM Storage Engine"), or during
    **DDL** operations on
    `InnoDB` tables that cannot be done with
    **online DDL**; those locks block
    concurrent access to the table.

    See Also [DDL](glossary.md#glos_ddl), [DML](glossary.md#glos_dml), [InnoDB](glossary.md#glos_innodb), [lock](glossary.md#glos_lock), [locking](glossary.md#glos_locking), [online DDL](glossary.md#glos_online_ddl), [table lock](glossary.md#glos_table_lock), [transaction](glossary.md#glos_transaction).

row-based replication
:   A form of **replication** where
    events are propagated from the
    **source** specifying how to change
    individual rows on the **replica**.
    It is safe to use for all settings of the
    [`innodb_autoinc_lock_mode`](innodb-parameters.md#sysvar_innodb_autoinc_lock_mode)
    option.

    See Also [auto-increment locking](glossary.md#glos_auto_increment_locking), [innodb\_autoinc\_lock\_mode](glossary.md#glos_innodb_autoinc_lock_mode), [replica](glossary.md#glos_replica), [replication](glossary.md#glos_replication), [source](glossary.md#glos_source), [statement-based replication](glossary.md#glos_statement_based_replication).

row-level locking
:   The **locking** mechanism used for
    **InnoDB** tables, relying on
    **row locks** rather than
    **table locks**. Multiple
    **transactions** can modify the
    same table concurrently. Only if two transactions try to modify
    the same row does one of the transactions wait for the other to
    complete (and release its row locks).

    See Also [InnoDB](glossary.md#glos_innodb), [locking](glossary.md#glos_locking), [row lock](glossary.md#glos_row_lock), [table lock](glossary.md#glos_table_lock), [transaction](glossary.md#glos_transaction).

Ruby
:   A programming language that emphasizes dynamic typing and
    object-oriented programming. Some syntax is familiar to
    **Perl** developers.

    See Also [API](glossary.md#glos_api), [Perl](glossary.md#glos_perl), [Ruby API](glossary.md#glos_ruby_api).

Ruby API
:   `mysql2`, based based on the
    **libmysqlclient** API library, is
    available for Ruby programmers developing MySQL applications.
    For more information, see [Section 31.11, “MySQL Ruby APIs”](apis-ruby.md "31.11 MySQL Ruby APIs").

    See Also [libmysql](glossary.md#glos_libmysql), [Ruby](glossary.md#glos_ruby).

rw-lock
:   The low-level object that `InnoDB` uses to
    represent and enforce shared-access
    **locks** to internal in-memory
    data structures following certain rules. Contrast with
    **mutexes**, which
    `InnoDB` uses to represent and enforce
    exclusive access to internal in-memory data structures. Mutexes
    and rw-locks are known collectively as
    **latches**.

    `rw-lock` types include
    `s-locks` (shared locks),
    `x-locks` (exclusive locks), and
    `sx-locks` (shared-exclusive locks).

    - An `s-lock` provides read access to a
      common resource.
    - An `x-lock` provides write access to a
      common resource while not permitting inconsistent reads by
      other threads.
    - An `sx-lock` provides write access to a
      common resource while permitting inconsistent reads by other
      threads. `sx-locks` were introduced in
      MySQL 5.7 to optimize concurrency and improve scalability
      for read-write workloads.

    The following matrix summarizes rw-lock type compatibility.

    |  | *`S`* | *`SX`* | *`X`* |
    | --- | --- | --- | --- |
    | *`S`* | Compatible | Compatible | Conflict |
    | *`SX`* | Compatible | Conflict | Conflict |
    | *`X`* | Conflict | Conflict | Conflict |

    See Also [latch](glossary.md#glos_latch), [lock](glossary.md#glos_lock), [mutex](glossary.md#glos_mutex), [Performance Schema](glossary.md#glos_performance_schema).

### S

savepoint
:   Savepoints help to implement nested
    **transactions**. They can be used
    to provide scope to operations on tables that are part of a
    larger transaction. For example, scheduling a trip in a
    reservation system might involve booking several different
    flights; if a desired flight is unavailable, you might
    **roll back** the changes involved
    in booking that one leg, without rolling back the earlier
    flights that were successfully booked.

    See Also [rollback](glossary.md#glos_rollback), [transaction](glossary.md#glos_transaction).

scalability
:   The ability to add more work and issue more simultaneous
    requests to a system, without a sudden drop in performance due
    to exceeding the limits of system capacity. Software
    architecture, hardware configuration, application coding, and
    type of workload all play a part in scalability. When the system
    reaches its maximum capacity, popular techniques for increasing
    scalability are **scale up**
    (increasing the capacity of existing hardware or software) and
    **scale out** (adding new servers
    and more instances of MySQL). Often paired with
    **availability** as critical
    aspects of a large-scale deployment.

    See Also [availability](glossary.md#glos_availability), [scale out](glossary.md#glos_scale_out), [scale up](glossary.md#glos_scale_up).

scale out
:   A technique for increasing
    **scalability** by adding new
    servers and more instances of MySQL. For example, setting up
    replication, NDB Cluster, connection pooling, or other features
    that spread work across a group of servers. Contrast with
    **scale up**.

    See Also [scalability](glossary.md#glos_scalability), [scale up](glossary.md#glos_scale_up).

scale up
:   A technique for increasing
    **scalability** by increasing the
    capacity of existing hardware or software. For example,
    increasing the memory on a server and adjusting memory-related
    parameters such as
    [`innodb_buffer_pool_size`](innodb-parameters.md#sysvar_innodb_buffer_pool_size) and
    [`innodb_buffer_pool_instances`](innodb-parameters.md#sysvar_innodb_buffer_pool_instances).
    Contrast with **scale out**.

    See Also [scalability](glossary.md#glos_scalability), [scale out](glossary.md#glos_scale_out).

schema
:   Conceptually, a schema is a set of interrelated database
    objects, such as tables, table columns, data types of the
    columns, indexes, foreign keys, and so on. These objects are
    connected through SQL syntax, because the columns make up the
    tables, the foreign keys refer to tables and columns, and so on.
    Ideally, they are also connected logically, working together as
    part of a unified application or flexible framework. For
    example, the **INFORMATION\_SCHEMA**
    and **performance\_schema**
    databases use “schema” in their names to emphasize
    the close relationships between the tables and columns they
    contain.

    In MySQL, physically, a **schema**
    is synonymous with a **database**.
    You can substitute the keyword `SCHEMA` instead
    of `DATABASE` in MySQL SQL syntax, for example
    using `CREATE SCHEMA` instead of
    `CREATE DATABASE`.

    Some other database products draw a distinction. For example, in
    the Oracle Database product, a
    **schema** represents only a part
    of a database: the tables and other objects owned by a single
    user.

    See Also [database](glossary.md#glos_database), [INFORMATION\_SCHEMA](glossary.md#glos_information_schema), [Performance Schema](glossary.md#glos_performance_schema).

SDI
:   Acronym for “serialized dictionary information”.

    See Also [serialized dictionary information (SDI)](glossary.md#glos_serialized_dictionary_information).

search index
:   In MySQL, **full-text search**
    queries use a special kind of index, the
    **FULLTEXT index**. In MySQL 5.6.4
    and up, `InnoDB` and `MyISAM`
    tables both support `FULLTEXT` indexes;
    formerly, these indexes were only available for
    `MyISAM` tables.

    See Also [full-text search](glossary.md#glos_full_text_search), [FULLTEXT index](glossary.md#glos_fulltext_index).

secondary index
:   A type of `InnoDB`
    **index** that represents a subset
    of table columns. An `InnoDB` table can have
    zero, one, or many secondary indexes. (Contrast with the
    **clustered index**, which is
    required for each `InnoDB` table, and stores
    the data for all the table columns.)

    A secondary index can be used to satisfy queries that only
    require values from the indexed columns. For more complex
    queries, it can be used to identify the relevant rows in the
    table, which are then retrieved through lookups using the
    clustered index.

    Creating and dropping secondary indexes has traditionally
    involved significant overhead from copying all the data in the
    `InnoDB` table. The **fast
    index creation** feature makes both `CREATE
    INDEX` and `DROP INDEX` statements
    much faster for `InnoDB` secondary indexes.

    See Also [clustered index](glossary.md#glos_clustered_index), [Fast Index Creation](glossary.md#glos_fast_index_creation), [index](glossary.md#glos_index).

segment
:   A division within an `InnoDB`
    **tablespace**. If a tablespace is
    analogous to a directory, the segments are analogous to files
    within that directory. A segment can grow. New segments can be
    created.

    For example, within a
    **file-per-table** tablespace,
    table data is in one segment and each associated index is in its
    own segment. The **system
    tablespace** contains many different segments, because
    it can hold many tables and their associated indexes. Prior to
    MySQL 8.0, the system tablespace also includes one or more
    **rollback segments** used for
    **undo logs**.

    Segments grow and shrink as data is inserted and deleted. When a
    segment needs more room, it is extended by one
    **extent** (1 megabyte) at a time.
    Similarly, a segment releases one extent's worth of space when
    all the data in that extent is no longer needed.

    See Also [extent](glossary.md#glos_extent), [file-per-table](glossary.md#glos_file_per_table), [rollback segment](glossary.md#glos_rollback_segment), [system tablespace](glossary.md#glos_system_tablespace), [tablespace](glossary.md#glos_tablespace), [undo log](glossary.md#glos_undo_log).

selectivity
:   A property of data distribution, the number of distinct values
    in a column (its **cardinality**)
    divided by the number of records in the table. High selectivity
    means that the column values are relatively unique, and can
    retrieved efficiently through an index. If you (or the query
    optimizer) can predict that a test in a `WHERE`
    clause only matches a small number (or proportion) of rows in a
    table, the overall **query** tends
    to be efficient if it evaluates that test first, using an index.

    See Also [cardinality](glossary.md#glos_cardinality), [query](glossary.md#glos_query).

semi-consistent read
:   A type of read operation used for `UPDATE`
    statements, that is a combination of **READ
    COMMITTED** and **consistent
    read**. When an `UPDATE` statement
    examines a row that is already locked, `InnoDB`
    returns the latest committed version to MySQL so that MySQL can
    determine whether the row matches the `WHERE`
    condition of the `UPDATE`. If the row matches
    (must be updated), MySQL reads the row again, and this time
    `InnoDB` either locks it or waits for a lock on
    it. This type of read operation can only happen when the
    transaction has the READ COMMITTED
    **isolation level**.

    See Also [consistent read](glossary.md#glos_consistent_read), [isolation level](glossary.md#glos_isolation_level), [READ COMMITTED](glossary.md#glos_read_committed).

SERIALIZABLE
:   The **isolation level** that uses
    the most conservative locking strategy, to prevent any other
    **transactions** from inserting or
    changing data that was read by this transaction, until it is
    finished. This way, the same query can be run over and over
    within a transaction, and be certain to retrieve the same set of
    results each time. Any attempt to change data that was committed
    by another transaction since the start of the current
    transaction, cause the current transaction to wait.

    This is the default isolation level specified by the SQL
    standard. In practice, this degree of strictness is rarely
    needed, so the default isolation level for
    `InnoDB` is the next most strict,
    **REPEATABLE READ**.

    See Also [ACID](glossary.md#glos_acid), [consistent read](glossary.md#glos_consistent_read), [isolation level](glossary.md#glos_isolation_level), [locking](glossary.md#glos_locking), [REPEATABLE READ](glossary.md#glos_repeatable_read), [transaction](glossary.md#glos_transaction).

serialized dictionary information (SDI)
:   Dictionary object metadata in serialized form. SDI is stored in
    `JSON` format.

    As of MySQL 8.0.3, SDI is present in all
    `InnoDB` tablespace files except for temporary
    tablespace and undo tablespace files. The presence of SDI in
    tablespace files provides metadata redundancy. For example,
    dictionary object metadata can be extracted from tablespace
    files using the [**ibd2sdi**](ibd2sdi.md "6.6.1 ibd2sdi — InnoDB Tablespace SDI Extraction Utility") utility if the data
    dictionary becomes unavailable.

    For a `MyISAM` table, SDI is stored in a
    `.sdi` metadata file in the schema directory.
    An SDI metadata file is required to perform an
    [`IMPORT TABLE`](import-table.md "15.2.6 IMPORT TABLE Statement") operation.

    See Also [file-per-table](glossary.md#glos_file_per_table), [general tablespace](glossary.md#glos_general_tablespace), [system tablespace](glossary.md#glos_system_tablespace), [tablespace](glossary.md#glos_tablespace).

server
:   A type of program that runs continuously, waiting to receive and
    act upon requests from another program (the
    **client**). Because often an
    entire computer is dedicated to running one or more server
    programs (such as a database server, a web server, an
    application server, or some combination of these), the term
    **server** can also refer to the
    computer that runs the server software.

    See Also [client](glossary.md#glos_client), [mysqld](glossary.md#glos_mysqld).

server-side prepared statement
:   A **prepared statement** managed by
    the MySQL server. Historically, issues with server-side prepared
    statements led **Connector/J** and
    **Connector/PHP** developers to
    sometimes use **client-side prepared
    statements** instead. With modern MySQL server
    versions, server-side prepared statements are recommended for
    performance, scalability, and memory efficiency.

    See Also [client-side prepared statement](glossary.md#glos_client_side_prepared_statement), [Connector/J](glossary.md#glos_connector_j), [Connector/PHP](glossary.md#glos_connector_php), [prepared statement](glossary.md#glos_prepared_statement).

service principal name
:   The name for a Kerberos named entity that represents a service.

    See Also [principal](glossary.md#glos_principal).

service ticket
:   A Kerberos ticket that provides access to an application
    service, such as the service provided by a web or database
    server.

servlet
:   See Also [Connector/J](glossary.md#glos_connector_j).

session temporary tablespace
:   A *temporary tablespace* that stores
    user-created *temporary tables* and internal
    temporary tables created by the *optimizer*
    when `InnoDB` is configured as the on-disk
    storage engine for internal temporary tables.

    See Also [optimizer](glossary.md#glos_optimizer), [temporary table](glossary.md#glos_temporary_table), [temporary tablespace](glossary.md#glos_temporary_tablespace).

shared lock
:   A kind of **lock** that allows
    other **transactions** to read the
    locked object, and to also acquire other shared locks on it, but
    not to write to it. The opposite of
    **exclusive lock**.

    See Also [exclusive lock](glossary.md#glos_exclusive_lock), [lock](glossary.md#glos_lock), [transaction](glossary.md#glos_transaction).

shared tablespace
:   Another way of referring to the **system
    tablespace** or a **general
    tablespace**. General tablespaces were introduced in
    MySQL 5.7. More than one table can reside in a shared
    tablespace. Only a single table can reside in a
    *file-per-table* tablespace.

    See Also [general tablespace](glossary.md#glos_general_tablespace), [system tablespace](glossary.md#glos_system_tablespace).

sharp checkpoint
:   The process of **flushing** to disk
    all **dirty** buffer pool pages
    whose redo entries are contained in certain portion of the
    **redo log**. Occurs before
    `InnoDB` reuses a portion of a log file; the
    log files are used in a circular fashion. Typically occurs with
    write-intensive **workloads**.

    See Also [dirty page](glossary.md#glos_dirty_page), [flush](glossary.md#glos_flush), [redo log](glossary.md#glos_redo_log), [workload](glossary.md#glos_workload).

shutdown
:   The process of stopping the MySQL server. By default, this
    process cleans up operations for
    **InnoDB** tables, so
    `InnoDB` can be
    **slow** to shut down, but fast to
    start up later. If you skip the cleanup operations, it is
    **fast** to shut down but the
    cleanup must be performed during the next restart.

    The shutdown mode for `InnoDB` is controlled by
    the [`innodb_fast_shutdown`](innodb-parameters.md#sysvar_innodb_fast_shutdown)
    option.

    See Also [fast shutdown](glossary.md#glos_fast_shutdown), [InnoDB](glossary.md#glos_innodb), [slow shutdown](glossary.md#glos_slow_shutdown), [startup](glossary.md#glos_startup).

slave
:   See [replica](glossary.md#glos_replica).

slow query log
:   A type of **log** used for
    performance tuning of SQL statements processed by the MySQL
    server. The log information is stored in a file. You must enable
    this feature to use it. You control which categories of
    “slow” SQL statements are logged. For more
    information, see [Section 7.4.5, “The Slow Query Log”](slow-query-log.md "7.4.5 The Slow Query Log").

    See Also [general query log](glossary.md#glos_general_query_log), [log](glossary.md#glos_log).

slow shutdown
:   A type of **shutdown** that does
    additional `InnoDB` flushing operations before
    completing. Also known as a **clean
    shutdown**. Specified by the configuration parameter
    [`innodb_fast_shutdown=0`](innodb-parameters.md#sysvar_innodb_fast_shutdown) or the
    command `SET GLOBAL innodb_fast_shutdown=0;`.
    Although the shutdown itself can take longer, that time should
    be saved on the subsequent startup.

    See Also [clean shutdown](glossary.md#glos_clean_shutdown), [fast shutdown](glossary.md#glos_fast_shutdown), [shutdown](glossary.md#glos_shutdown).

snapshot
:   A representation of data at a particular time, which remains the
    same even as changes are
    **committed** by other
    **transactions**. Used by certain
    **isolation levels** to allow
    **consistent reads**.

    See Also [commit](glossary.md#glos_commit), [consistent read](glossary.md#glos_consistent_read), [isolation level](glossary.md#glos_isolation_level), [transaction](glossary.md#glos_transaction).

sort buffer
:   The buffer used for sorting data during creation of an
    `InnoDB` index. Sort buffer size is configured
    using the
    [`innodb_sort_buffer_size`](innodb-parameters.md#sysvar_innodb_sort_buffer_size)
    configuration option.

source
:   A database server machine in a
    **replication** scenario that
    processes the initial insert, update, and delete requests for
    data. These changes are propagated to, and repeated on, other
    servers known as **replicas**.

    See Also [replica](glossary.md#glos_replica), [replication](glossary.md#glos_replication).

space ID
:   An identifier used to uniquely identify an
    `InnoDB`
    **tablespace** within a MySQL
    instance. The space ID for the **system
    tablespace** is always zero; this same ID applies to
    all tables within the system tablespace or within a general
    tablespace. Each **file-per-table**
    tablespace and **general
    tablespace** has its own space ID.

    Prior to MySQL 5.6, this hardcoded value presented difficulties
    in moving `InnoDB` tablespace files between
    MySQL instances. Starting in MySQL 5.6, you can copy tablespace
    files between instances by using the
    **transportable tablespace**
    feature involving the statements `FLUSH TABLES ... FOR
    EXPORT`, `ALTER TABLE ... DISCARD
    TABLESPACE`, and `ALTER TABLE ... IMPORT
    TABLESPACE`. The information needed to adjust the space
    ID is conveyed in the **.cfg file**
    which you copy along with the tablespace. See
    [Section 17.6.1.3, “Importing InnoDB Tables”](innodb-table-import.md "17.6.1.3 Importing InnoDB Tables") for details.

    See Also [.cfg file](glossary.md#glos_cfg_file), [file-per-table](glossary.md#glos_file_per_table), [general tablespace](glossary.md#glos_general_tablespace), [.ibd file](glossary.md#glos_ibd_file), [system tablespace](glossary.md#glos_system_tablespace), [tablespace](glossary.md#glos_tablespace), [transportable tablespace](glossary.md#glos_transportable_tablespace).

sparse file
:   A type of file that uses file system space more efficiently by
    writing metadata representing empty blocks to disk instead of
    writing the actual empty space. The `InnoDB`
    **transparent page compression**
    feature relies on sparse file support. For more information, see
    [Section 17.9.2, “InnoDB Page Compression”](innodb-page-compression.md "17.9.2 InnoDB Page Compression").

    See Also [hole punching](glossary.md#glos_hole_punching), [transparent page compression](glossary.md#glos_transparent_page_compression).

spin
:   A type of **wait** operation that
    continuously tests whether a resource becomes available. This
    technique is used for resources that are typically held only for
    brief periods, where it is more efficient to wait in a
    “busy loop” than to put the thread to sleep and
    perform a context switch. If the resource does not become
    available within a short time, the spin loop ceases and another
    wait technique is used.

    See Also [latch](glossary.md#glos_latch), [lock](glossary.md#glos_lock), [mutex](glossary.md#glos_mutex), [wait](glossary.md#glos_wait).

SPN
:   See [service principal name](glossary.md#glos_service_principal_name).

Spring
:   A Java-based application framework designed for assisting in
    application design by providing a way to configure components.

    See Also [J2EE](glossary.md#glos_j2ee).

SQL
:   The Structured Query Language that is standard for performing
    database operations. Often divided into the categories
    **DDL**,
    **DML**, and
    **queries**. MySQL includes some
    additional statement categories such as
    **replication**. See
    [Chapter 11, *Language Structure*](language-structure.md "Chapter 11 Language Structure") for the building blocks of
    SQL syntax, [Chapter 13, *Data Types*](data-types.md "Chapter 13 Data Types") for the data types to
    use for MySQL table columns, [Chapter 15, *SQL Statements*](sql-statements.md "Chapter 15 SQL Statements")
    for details about SQL statements and their associated
    categories, and [Chapter 14, *Functions and Operators*](functions.md "Chapter 14 Functions and Operators") for standard and
    MySQL-specific functions to use in queries.

    See Also [DDL](glossary.md#glos_ddl), [DML](glossary.md#glos_dml), [query](glossary.md#glos_query), [replication](glossary.md#glos_replication).

SQLState
:   An error code defined by the
    **JDBC** standard, for exception
    handling by applications using
    **Connector/J**.

    See Also [Connector/J](glossary.md#glos_connector_j), [JDBC](glossary.md#glos_jdbc).

SSD
:   Acronym for “solid-state drive”. A type of storage
    device with different performance characteristics than a
    traditional hard disk drive
    (**HDD**): smaller storage
    capacity, faster for random reads, no moving parts, and with a
    number of considerations affecting write performance. Its
    performance characteristics can influence the throughput of a
    **disk-bound** workload.

    See Also [disk-bound](glossary.md#glos_disk_bound), [HDD](glossary.md#glos_hdd).

SSL
:   Acronym for “secure sockets layer”. Provides the
    encryption layer for network communication between an
    application and a MySQL database server.

    See Also [keystore](glossary.md#glos_keystore), [truststore](glossary.md#glos_truststore).

ST
:   See [service ticket](glossary.md#glos_service_ticket).

startup
:   The process of starting the MySQL server. Typically done by one
    of the programs listed in [Section 6.3, “Server and Server-Startup Programs”](programs-server.md "6.3 Server and Server-Startup Programs"). The
    opposite of **shutdown**.

    See Also [shutdown](glossary.md#glos_shutdown).

statement interceptor
:   A type of **interceptor** for
    tracing, debugging, or augmenting SQL statements issued by a
    database application. Sometimes also known as a
    **command interceptor**.

    In **Java** applications using
    **Connector/J**, setting up this
    type of interceptor involves implementing the
    `com.mysql.jdbc.StatementInterceptorV2`
    interface, and adding a `statementInterceptors`
    property to the **connection
    string**.

    In **Visual Studio** applications
    using **Connector/NET**, setting up this
    type of interceptor involves defining a class that inherits from
    the `BaseCommandInterceptor` class and
    specifying that class name as part of the connection string.

    See Also [command interceptor](glossary.md#glos_command_interceptor), [connection string](glossary.md#glos_connection_string), [Connector/J](glossary.md#glos_connector_j), [Connector/NET](glossary.md#glos_connector_net), [interceptor](glossary.md#glos_interceptor), [Java](glossary.md#glos_java), [Visual Studio](glossary.md#glos_visual_studio).

statement-based replication
:   A form of **replication** where SQL
    statements are sent from the
    **source** and replayed on the
    **replica**. It requires some care
    with the setting for the
    [`innodb_autoinc_lock_mode`](innodb-parameters.md#sysvar_innodb_autoinc_lock_mode)
    option, to avoid potential timing problems with
    **auto-increment locking**.

    See Also [auto-increment locking](glossary.md#glos_auto_increment_locking), [innodb\_autoinc\_lock\_mode](glossary.md#glos_innodb_autoinc_lock_mode), [replica](glossary.md#glos_replica), [replication](glossary.md#glos_replication), [row-based replication](glossary.md#glos_row_based_replication), [source](glossary.md#glos_source).

statistics
:   Estimated values relating to each `InnoDB`
    **table** and
    **index**, used to construct an
    efficient **query execution plan**.
    The main values are the
    **cardinality** (number of distinct
    values) and the total number of table rows or index entries. The
    statistics for the table represent the data in its
    **primary key** index. The
    statistics for a **secondary
    index** represent the rows covered by that index.

    The values are estimated rather than counted precisely because
    at any moment, different
    **transactions** can be inserting
    and deleting rows from the same table. To keep the values from
    being recalculated frequently, you can enable
    **persistent statistics**, where
    the values are stored in `InnoDB` system
    tables, and refreshed only when you issue an
    [`ANALYZE TABLE`](analyze-table.md "15.7.3.1 ANALYZE TABLE Statement") statement.

    You can control how **NULL** values
    are treated when calculating statistics through the
    [`innodb_stats_method`](innodb-parameters.md#sysvar_innodb_stats_method)
    configuration option.

    Other types of statistics are available for database objects and
    database activity through the
    **INFORMATION\_SCHEMA** and
    **PERFORMANCE\_SCHEMA** tables.

    See Also [cardinality](glossary.md#glos_cardinality), [index](glossary.md#glos_index), [INFORMATION\_SCHEMA](glossary.md#glos_information_schema), [NULL](glossary.md#glos_null), [Performance Schema](glossary.md#glos_performance_schema), [persistent statistics](glossary.md#glos_persistent_statistics), [primary key](glossary.md#glos_primary_key), [query execution plan](glossary.md#glos_query_execution_plan), [secondary index](glossary.md#glos_secondary_index), [table](glossary.md#glos_table), [transaction](glossary.md#glos_transaction).

stemming
:   The ability to search for different variations of a word based
    on a common root word, such as singular and plural, or past,
    present, and future verb tense. This feature is currently
    supported in `MyISAM`
    **full-text search** feature but
    not in **FULLTEXT indexes** for
    `InnoDB` tables.

    See Also [full-text search](glossary.md#glos_full_text_search), [FULLTEXT index](glossary.md#glos_fulltext_index).

stopword
:   In a **FULLTEXT index**, a word
    that is considered common or trivial enough that it is omitted
    from the **search index** and
    ignored in search queries. Different configuration settings
    control stopword processing for `InnoDB` and
    `MyISAM` tables. See
    [Section 14.9.4, “Full-Text Stopwords”](fulltext-stopwords.md "14.9.4 Full-Text Stopwords") for details.

    See Also [FULLTEXT index](glossary.md#glos_fulltext_index), [search index](glossary.md#glos_search_index).

storage engine
:   A component of the MySQL database that performs the low-level
    work of storing, updating, and querying data. In MySQL 5.5 and
    higher, **InnoDB** is the default
    storage engine for new tables, superceding
    `MyISAM`. Different storage engines are
    designed with different tradeoffs between factors such as memory
    usage versus disk usage, read speed versus write speed, and
    speed versus robustness. Each storage engine manages specific
    tables, so we refer to [`InnoDB`](innodb-storage-engine.md "Chapter 17 The InnoDB Storage Engine")
    tables, [`MyISAM`](myisam-storage-engine.md "18.2 The MyISAM Storage Engine") tables, and so on.

    The **MySQL Enterprise Backup** product is optimized
    for backing up `InnoDB` tables. It can also
    back up tables handled by `MyISAM` and other
    storage engines.

    See Also [InnoDB](glossary.md#glos_innodb), [MySQL Enterprise Backup](glossary.md#glos_mysql_enterprise_backup), [table type](glossary.md#glos_table_type).

stored generated column
:   A column whose values are computed from an expression included
    in the column definition. Column values are evaluated and stored
    when rows are inserted or updated. A stored generated column
    requires storage space and can be indexed.

    Contrast with **virtual generated
    column**.

    See Also [base column](glossary.md#glos_base_column), [generated column](glossary.md#glos_generated_column), [virtual generated column](glossary.md#glos_virtual_generated_column).

stored object
:   A stored program or view.

stored program
:   A stored routine (procedure or function), trigger, or Event
    Scheduler event.

stored routine
:   A stored procedure or function.

strict mode
:   The general name for the setting controlled by the
    [`innodb_strict_mode`](innodb-parameters.md#sysvar_innodb_strict_mode) option.
    Turning on this setting causes certain conditions that are
    normally treated as warnings, to be considered errors. For
    example, certain invalid combinations of options related to
    **file format** and
    **row format**, that normally
    produce a warning and continue with default values, now cause
    the `CREATE TABLE` operation to fail.
    [`innodb_strict_mode`](innodb-parameters.md#sysvar_innodb_strict_mode) is enabled
    by default in MySQL 5.7.

    MySQL also has something called strict mode. See
    [Section 7.1.11, “Server SQL Modes”](sql-mode.md "7.1.11 Server SQL Modes").

    See Also [file format](glossary.md#glos_file_format), [innodb\_strict\_mode](glossary.md#glos_innodb_strict_mode), [row format](glossary.md#glos_row_format).

sublist
:   Within the list structure that represents the
    **buffer pool**, pages that are
    relatively old and relatively new are represented by different
    portions of the **list**. A set of
    parameters control the size of these portions and the dividing
    point between the new and old pages.

    See Also [buffer pool](glossary.md#glos_buffer_pool), [eviction](glossary.md#glos_eviction), [list](glossary.md#glos_list), [LRU](glossary.md#glos_lru).

supremum record
:   A **pseudo-record** in an index,
    representing the **gap** above the
    largest value in that index. If a transaction has a statement
    such as `SELECT ... FROM ... WHERE col > 10 FOR
    UPDATE;`, and the largest value in the column is 20, it
    is a lock on the supremum record that prevents other
    transactions from inserting even larger values such as 50, 100,
    and so on.

    See Also [gap](glossary.md#glos_gap), [infimum record](glossary.md#glos_infimum_record), [pseudo-record](glossary.md#glos_pseudo_record).

surrogate key
:   Synonym name for **synthetic key**.

    See Also [synthetic key](glossary.md#glos_synthetic_key).

synthetic key
:   An indexed column, typically a **primary
    key**, where the values are assigned arbitrarily. Often
    done using an **auto-increment**
    column. By treating the value as completely arbitrary, you can
    avoid overly restrictive rules and faulty application
    assumptions. For example, a numeric sequence representing
    employee numbers might have a gap if an employee was approved
    for hiring but never actually joined. Or employee number 100
    might have a later hiring date than employee number 500, if they
    left the company and later rejoined. Numeric values also produce
    shorter values of predictable length. For example, storing
    numeric codes meaning “Road”,
    “Boulevard”, “Expressway”, and so on
    is more space-efficient than repeating those strings over and
    over.

    Also known as a **surrogate key**.
    Contrast with **natural key**.

    See Also [auto-increment](glossary.md#glos_auto_increment), [natural key](glossary.md#glos_natural_key), [primary key](glossary.md#glos_primary_key), [surrogate key](glossary.md#glos_surrogate_key).

system tablespace
:   One or more data files (**ibdata
    files**) containing the metadata for
    `InnoDB`-related objects, and the storage areas
    for the **change buffer**, and the
    **doublewrite buffer**. It may also
    contain table and index data for `InnoDB`
    tables if tables were created in the system tablespace instead
    of **file-per-table** or
    **general tablespaces**. The data
    and metadata in the system tablespace apply to all
    **databases** in a MySQL
    **instance**.

    Prior to MySQL 5.6.7, the default was to keep all
    `InnoDB` tables and indexes inside the system
    tablespace, often causing this file to become very large.
    Because the system tablespace never shrinks, storage problems
    could arise if large amounts of temporary data were loaded and
    then deleted. In MySQL 8.0, the default is
    **file-per-table** mode, where each
    table and its associated indexes are stored in a separate
    **.ibd file**. This default makes
    it easier to use `InnoDB` features that rely on
    `DYNAMIC` and `COMPRESSED` row
    formats, such as table
    **compression**, efficient storage
    of **off-page columns**, and large
    index key prefixes.

    Keeping all table data in the system tablespace or in separate
    `.ibd` files has implications for storage
    management in general. The
    **MySQL Enterprise Backup** product might back up a
    small set of large files, or many smaller files. On systems with
    thousands of tables, the file system operations to process
    thousands of `.ibd` files can cause
    bottlenecks.

    `InnoDB` introduced general tablespaces in
    MySQL 5.7.6, which are also represented by
    `.ibd` files. General tablespaces are shared
    tablespaces created using [`CREATE
    TABLESPACE`](create-tablespace.md "15.1.21 CREATE TABLESPACE Statement") syntax. They can be created outside of the
    data directory, are capable of holding multiple tables, and
    support tables of all row formats.

### T

table
:   Each MySQL table is associated with a particular
    **storage engine**.
    **InnoDB** tables have particular
    **physical** and
    **logical** characteristics that
    affect performance,
    **scalability**,
    **backup**, administration, and
    application development.

    In terms of file storage, an `InnoDB` table
    belongs to one of the following tablespace types:

    - The shared `InnoDB`
      **system tablespace**, which is
      comprised of one or more **ibdata
      files**.
    - A **file-per-table**
      tablespace, comprised of an individual
      **.ibd file**.
    - A shared **general
      tablespace**, comprised of an individual
      `.ibd` file. General tablespaces were
      introduced in MySQL 5.7.6.

    **`.ibd`** data
    files contain both table and
    **index** data.

    `InnoDB` tables created in file-per-table
    tablespaces can use **DYNAMIC** or
    **COMPRESSED** row format. These
    row formats enable `InnoDB` features such as
    **compression**, efficient storage
    of **off-page columns**, and large
    index key prefixes. General tablespaces support all row formats.

    The system tablespace supports tables that use
    **REDUNDANT**,
    **COMPACT**, and
    **DYNAMIC** row formats. System
    tablespace support for the
    **DYNAMIC** row format was added in
    MySQL 5.7.6.

    The **rows** of an
    `InnoDB` table are organized into an index
    structure known as the **clustered
    index**, with entries sorted based on the
    **primary key** columns of the
    table. Data access is optimized for queries that filter and sort
    on the primary key columns, and each index contains a copy of
    the associated primary key columns for each entry. Modifying
    values for any of the primary key columns is an expensive
    operation. Thus an important aspect of `InnoDB`
    table design is choosing a primary key with columns that are
    used in the most important queries, and keeping the primary key
    short, with rarely changing values.

    See Also [backup](glossary.md#glos_backup), [clustered index](glossary.md#glos_clustered_index), [compact row format](glossary.md#glos_compact_row_format), [compressed row format](glossary.md#glos_compressed_row_format), [compression](glossary.md#glos_compression), [dynamic row format](glossary.md#glos_dynamic_row_format), [Fast Index Creation](glossary.md#glos_fast_index_creation), [file-per-table](glossary.md#glos_file_per_table), [.ibd file](glossary.md#glos_ibd_file), [index](glossary.md#glos_index), [off-page column](glossary.md#glos_off_page_column), [primary key](glossary.md#glos_primary_key), [redundant row format](glossary.md#glos_redundant_row_format), [row](glossary.md#glos_row), [system tablespace](glossary.md#glos_system_tablespace), [tablespace](glossary.md#glos_tablespace).

table lock
:   A lock that prevents any other
    **transaction** from accessing a
    table. `InnoDB` makes considerable effort to
    make such locks unnecessary, by using techniques such as
    **online DDL**,
    **row locks** and
    **consistent reads** for processing
    **DML** statements and
    **queries**. You can create such a
    lock through SQL using the `LOCK TABLE`
    statement; one of the steps in migrating from other database
    systems or MySQL storage engines is to remove such statements
    wherever practical.

    See Also [consistent read](glossary.md#glos_consistent_read), [DML](glossary.md#glos_dml), [lock](glossary.md#glos_lock), [locking](glossary.md#glos_locking), [online DDL](glossary.md#glos_online_ddl), [query](glossary.md#glos_query), [row lock](glossary.md#glos_row_lock), [table](glossary.md#glos_table), [transaction](glossary.md#glos_transaction).

table scan
:   See [full table scan](glossary.md#glos_full_table_scan).

table statistics
:   See [statistics](glossary.md#glos_statistics).

table type
:   Obsolete synonym for **storage
    engine**. We refer to
    [`InnoDB`](innodb-storage-engine.md "Chapter 17 The InnoDB Storage Engine") tables,
    [`MyISAM`](myisam-storage-engine.md "18.2 The MyISAM Storage Engine") tables, and so on.

    See Also [InnoDB](glossary.md#glos_innodb), [storage engine](glossary.md#glos_storage_engine).

tablespace
:   A data file that can hold data for one or more
    `InnoDB`
    **tables** and associated
    **indexes**.

    The **system tablespace** contains
    the `InnoDB` **data
    dictionary**, and prior to MySQL 5.6 holds all other
    `InnoDB` tables by default.

    The [`innodb_file_per_table`](innodb-parameters.md#sysvar_innodb_file_per_table)
    option, enabled by default in MySQL 5.6 and higher, allows
    tables to be created in their own tablespaces. File-per-table
    tablespaces support features such as efficient storage of
    **off-page columns**, table
    compression, and transportable tablespaces. See
    [Section 17.6.3.2, “File-Per-Table Tablespaces”](innodb-file-per-table-tablespaces.md "17.6.3.2 File-Per-Table Tablespaces") for details.

    `InnoDB` introduced general tablespaces in
    MySQL 5.7.6. General tablespaces are shared tablespaces created
    using [`CREATE TABLESPACE`](create-tablespace.md "15.1.21 CREATE TABLESPACE Statement") syntax.
    They can be created outside of the MySQL data directory, are
    capable of holding multiple tables, and support tables of all
    row formats.

    MySQL NDB Cluster also groups its tables into tablespaces. See
    [Section 25.6.11.1, “NDB Cluster Disk Data Objects”](mysql-cluster-disk-data-objects.md "25.6.11.1 NDB Cluster Disk Data Objects") for details.

    See Also [compressed row format](glossary.md#glos_compressed_row_format), [data dictionary](glossary.md#glos_data_dictionary), [data files](glossary.md#glos_data_files), [file-per-table](glossary.md#glos_file_per_table), [general tablespace](glossary.md#glos_general_tablespace), [index](glossary.md#glos_index), [innodb\_file\_per\_table](glossary.md#glos_innodb_file_per_table), [system tablespace](glossary.md#glos_system_tablespace), [table](glossary.md#glos_table).

Tcl
:   A programming language originating in the Unix scripting world.
    Sometimes extended by code written in
    **C**,
    **C++**, or
    **Java**. For the open-source Tcl
    **API** for MySQL, see
    [Section 31.12, “MySQL Tcl API”](apis-tcl.md "31.12 MySQL Tcl API").

    See Also [API](glossary.md#glos_api).

temporary table
:   A **table** whose data does not
    need to be truly permanent. For example, temporary tables might
    be used as storage areas for intermediate results in complicated
    calculations or transformations; this intermediate data would
    not need to be recovered after a crash. Database products can
    take various shortcuts to improve the performance of operations
    on temporary tables, by being less scrupulous about writing data
    to disk and other measures to protect the data across restarts.

    Sometimes, the data itself is removed automatically at a set
    time, such as when the transaction ends or when the session
    ends. With some database products, the table itself is removed
    automatically too.

    See Also [table](glossary.md#glos_table).

temporary tablespace
:   `InnoDB` uses two types of temporary
    tablespace. *Session temporary tablespaces*
    store user-created temporary tables and internal temporary
    tables created by the optimizer. The *global temporary
    tablespace* stores *rollback
    segments* for changes made to user-created temporary
    tables.

    See Also [global temporary tablespace](glossary.md#glos_global_temporary_tablespace), [session temporary tablespace](glossary.md#glos_session_temporary_tablespace), [temporary table](glossary.md#glos_temporary_table).

text collection
:   The set of columns included in a **FULLTEXT
    index**.

    See Also [FULLTEXT index](glossary.md#glos_fulltext_index).

TGS
:   A Kerberos ticket-granting server. TGS can also refer to the
    ticket-granting service provided by a ticket-granting server.

    See Also [ticket-granting server](glossary.md#glos_ticket_granting_server).

TGT
:   See [ticket-granting ticket](glossary.md#glos_ticket_granting_ticket).

thread
:   A unit of processing that is typically more lightweight than a
    **process**, allowing for greater
    **concurrency**.

    See Also [concurrency](glossary.md#glos_concurrency), [master thread](glossary.md#glos_master_thread), [process](glossary.md#glos_process), [Pthreads](glossary.md#glos_pthreads).

ticket-granting server
:   In Kerberos, a server that provides tickets. The ticket-granting
    server (TGS) combined with an authentication server (AS) make up
    a key distribution center (KDC).

    TGS can also refer to the ticket-granting service provided by
    the ticket-granting server.

    See Also [authentication server](glossary.md#glos_authentication_server), [key distribution center](glossary.md#glos_key_distribution_center).

ticket-granting ticket
:   In Kerberos, a ticket-granting ticket is presented to the
    ticket-granting server (TGS) to obtain service tickets for
    service access.

    See Also [ticket-granting server](glossary.md#glos_ticket_granting_server).

Tomcat
:   An open source **J2EE** application
    server, implementing the Java Servlet and JavaServer Pages
    programming technologies. Consists of a web server and Java
    servlet container. With MySQL, typically used in conjunction
    with **Connector/J**.

    See Also [J2EE](glossary.md#glos_j2ee).

torn page
:   An error condition that can occur due to a combination of I/O
    device configuration and hardware failure. If data is written
    out in chunks smaller than the `InnoDB`
    **page size** (by default, 16KB), a
    hardware failure while writing could result in only part of a
    page being stored to disk. The `InnoDB`
    **doublewrite buffer** guards
    against this possibility.

    See Also [doublewrite buffer](glossary.md#glos_doublewrite_buffer).

TPS
:   Acronym for “**transactions**
    per second”, a unit of measurement sometimes used in
    benchmarks. Its value depends on the
    **workload** represented by a
    particular benchmark test, combined with factors that you
    control such as the hardware capacity and database
    configuration.

    See Also [transaction](glossary.md#glos_transaction), [workload](glossary.md#glos_workload).

transaction
:   Transactions are atomic units of work that can be
    **committed** or
    **rolled back**. When a transaction
    makes multiple changes to the database, either all the changes
    succeed when the transaction is committed, or all the changes
    are undone when the transaction is rolled back.

    Database transactions, as implemented by
    `InnoDB`, have properties that are collectively
    known by the acronym **ACID**, for
    atomicity, consistency, isolation, and durability.

    See Also [ACID](glossary.md#glos_acid), [commit](glossary.md#glos_commit), [isolation level](glossary.md#glos_isolation_level), [lock](glossary.md#glos_lock), [rollback](glossary.md#glos_rollback).

transaction ID
:   An internal field associated with each
    **row**. This field is physically
    changed by [`INSERT`](insert.md "15.2.7 INSERT Statement"),
    [`UPDATE`](update.md "15.2.17 UPDATE Statement"), and
    [`DELETE`](delete.md "15.2.2 DELETE Statement") operations to record which
    **transaction** has locked the row.

    See Also [implicit row lock](glossary.md#glos_implicit_row_lock), [row](glossary.md#glos_row), [transaction](glossary.md#glos_transaction).

transparent page compression
:   A feature added in MySQL 5.7.8 that permits page-level
    compression for `InnoDB` tables that reside in
    **file-per-table** tablespaces.
    Page compression is enabled by specifying the
    `COMPRESSION` attribute with
    [`CREATE TABLE`](create-table.md "15.1.20 CREATE TABLE Statement") or
    [`ALTER TABLE`](alter-table.md "15.1.9 ALTER TABLE Statement"). For more
    information, see [Section 17.9.2, “InnoDB Page Compression”](innodb-page-compression.md "17.9.2 InnoDB Page Compression").

    See Also [file-per-table](glossary.md#glos_file_per_table), [hole punching](glossary.md#glos_hole_punching), [sparse file](glossary.md#glos_sparse_file).

transportable tablespace
:   A feature that allows a
    **tablespace** to be moved from one
    instance to another. Traditionally, this has not been possible
    for `InnoDB` tablespaces because all table data
    was part of the **system
    tablespace**. In MySQL 5.6 and higher, the
    [`FLUSH
    TABLES ... FOR EXPORT`](flush.md#flush-tables-for-export-with-list) syntax prepares an
    `InnoDB` table for copying to another server;
    running [`ALTER TABLE
    ... DISCARD TABLESPACE`](alter-table.md "15.1.9 ALTER TABLE Statement") and
    [`ALTER TABLE ...
    IMPORT TABLESPACE`](alter-table.md "15.1.9 ALTER TABLE Statement") on the other server brings the
    copied data file into the other instance. A separate
    **.cfg file**, copied along with
    the **.ibd file**, is used to
    update the table metadata (for example the
    **space ID**) as the tablespace is
    imported. See [Section 17.6.1.3, “Importing InnoDB Tables”](innodb-table-import.md "17.6.1.3 Importing InnoDB Tables") for usage
    information.

    See Also [.cfg file](glossary.md#glos_cfg_file), [.ibd file](glossary.md#glos_ibd_file), [space ID](glossary.md#glos_space_id), [system tablespace](glossary.md#glos_system_tablespace), [tablespace](glossary.md#glos_tablespace).

troubleshooting
:   The process of determining the source of a problem. Some of the
    resources for troubleshooting MySQL problems include:

    - [Section 2.9.2.1, “Troubleshooting Problems Starting the MySQL Server”](starting-server-troubleshooting.md "2.9.2.1 Troubleshooting Problems Starting the MySQL Server")
    - [Section 8.2.22, “Troubleshooting Problems Connecting to MySQL”](problems-connecting.md "8.2.22 Troubleshooting Problems Connecting to MySQL")
    - [Section B.3.3.2, “How to Reset the Root Password”](resetting-permissions.md "B.3.3.2 How to Reset the Root Password")
    - [Section B.3.2, “Common Errors When Using MySQL Programs”](common-errors.md "B.3.2 Common Errors When Using MySQL Programs")
    - [Section 17.21, “InnoDB Troubleshooting”](innodb-troubleshooting.md "17.21 InnoDB Troubleshooting").

truncate
:   A **DDL** operation that removes
    the entire contents of a table, while leaving the table and
    related indexes intact. Contrast with
    **drop**. Although conceptually it
    has the same result as a `DELETE` statement
    with no `WHERE` clause, it operates differently
    behind the scenes: `InnoDB` creates a new empty
    table, drops the old table, then renames the new table to take
    the place of the old one. Because this is a DDL operation, it
    cannot be **rolled back**.

    If the table being truncated contains
    **foreign keys** that reference
    another table, the truncation operation uses a slower method of
    operation, deleting one row at a time so that corresponding rows
    in the referenced table can be deleted as needed by any
    `ON DELETE CASCADE` clause. (MySQL 5.5 and
    higher do not allow this slower form of truncate, and return an
    error instead if foreign keys are involved. In this case, use a
    `DELETE` statement instead.

    See Also [DDL](glossary.md#glos_ddl), [drop](glossary.md#glos_drop), [foreign key](glossary.md#glos_foreign_key), [rollback](glossary.md#glos_rollback).

truststore
:   See Also [SSL](glossary.md#glos_ssl).

tuple
:   A technical term designating an ordered set of elements. It is
    an abstract notion, used in formal discussions of database
    theory. In the database field, tuples are usually represented by
    the columns of a table row. They could also be represented by
    the result sets of queries, for example, queries that retrieved
    only some columns of a table, or columns from joined tables.

    See Also [cursor](glossary.md#glos_cursor).

two-phase commit
:   An operation that is part of a distributed
    **transaction**, under the
    **XA** specification. (Sometimes
    abbreviated as 2PC.) When multiple databases participate in the
    transaction, either all databases
    **commit** the changes, or all
    databases **roll back** the
    changes.

    See Also [commit](glossary.md#glos_commit), [rollback](glossary.md#glos_rollback), [transaction](glossary.md#glos_transaction), [XA](glossary.md#glos_xa).

### U

undo
:   Data that is maintained throughout the life of a
    **transaction**, recording all
    changes so that they can be undone in case of a
    **rollback** operation. It is
    stored in **undo logs** either
    within the **system tablespace**
    (in MySQL 5.7 or earlier) or in separate
    **undo tablespaces**. As of MySQL
    8.0, undo logs reside in undo tablespaces by default.

    See Also [rollback](glossary.md#glos_rollback), [rollback segment](glossary.md#glos_rollback_segment), [system tablespace](glossary.md#glos_system_tablespace), [transaction](glossary.md#glos_transaction), [undo log](glossary.md#glos_undo_log), [undo tablespace](glossary.md#glos_undo_tablespace).

undo buffer
:   See [undo log](glossary.md#glos_undo_log).

undo log
:   A storage area that holds copies of data modified by active
    **transactions**. If another
    transaction needs to see the original data (as part of a
    **consistent read** operation), the
    unmodified data is retrieved from this storage area.

    In MySQL 5.6 and MySQL 5.7, you can use the
    [`innodb_undo_tablespaces`](innodb-parameters.md#sysvar_innodb_undo_tablespaces)
    variable have undo logs reside in **undo
    tablespaces**, which can be placed on another storage
    device such as an **SSD**. In MySQL
    8.0, undo logs reside in two default undo tablespaces that are
    created when MySQL is initialized, and additional undo
    tablespaces can be created using
    [`CREATE UNDO
    TABLESPACE`](create-tablespace.md "15.1.21 CREATE TABLESPACE Statement") syntax.

    The undo log is split into separate portions, the
    **insert undo buffer** and the
    **update undo buffer**.

    See Also [consistent read](glossary.md#glos_consistent_read), [rollback segment](glossary.md#glos_rollback_segment), [SSD](glossary.md#glos_ssd), [system tablespace](glossary.md#glos_system_tablespace), [transaction](glossary.md#glos_transaction), [undo tablespace](glossary.md#glos_undo_tablespace).

undo log segment
:   A collection of **undo logs**. Undo
    log segments exists within **rollback
    segments**. An undo log segment might contain undo logs
    from multiple transactions. An undo log segment can only be used
    by one transaction at a time but can be reused after it is
    released at transaction **commit**
    or **rollback**. May also be
    referred to as an “undo segment”.

    See Also [commit](glossary.md#glos_commit), [rollback](glossary.md#glos_rollback), [rollback segment](glossary.md#glos_rollback_segment), [undo log](glossary.md#glos_undo_log).

undo tablespace
:   An undo tablespace contains **undo
    logs**. Undo logs exist within
    **undo log segments**, which are
    contained within **rollback
    segments**. Rollback segments have traditionally
    resided in the system tablespace. As of MySQL 5.6, rollback
    segments can reside in undo tablespaces. In MySQL 5.6 and MySQL
    5.7, the number of undo tablespaces is controlled by the
    [`innodb_undo_tablespaces`](innodb-parameters.md#sysvar_innodb_undo_tablespaces)
    configuration option. In MySQL 8.0, two default undo tablespaces
    are created when the MySQL instance is initialized, and
    additional undo tablespaces can be created using
    [`CREATE UNDO
    TABLESPACE`](create-tablespace.md "15.1.21 CREATE TABLESPACE Statement") syntax.

    For more information, see
    [Section 17.6.3.4, “Undo Tablespaces”](innodb-undo-tablespaces.md "17.6.3.4 Undo Tablespaces").

    See Also [rollback segment](glossary.md#glos_rollback_segment), [system tablespace](glossary.md#glos_system_tablespace), [undo log](glossary.md#glos_undo_log), [undo log segment](glossary.md#glos_undo_log_segment).

Unicode
:   A system for supporting national characters, character sets,
    code pages, and other internationalization aspects in a flexible
    and standardized way.

    Unicode support is an important aspect of the
    **ODBC** standard.
    **Connector/ODBC** 5.1 is a Unicode
    driver, as opposed to Connector/ODBC 3.51, which is an
    **ANSI** driver.

    See Also [ANSI](glossary.md#glos_ansi), [Connector/ODBC](glossary.md#glos_connector_odbc), [ODBC](glossary.md#glos_odbc).

unique constraint
:   A kind of **constraint** that
    asserts that a column cannot contain any duplicate values. In
    terms of **relational** algebra, it
    is used to specify 1-to-1 relationships. For efficiency in
    checking whether a value can be inserted (that is, the value
    does not already exist in the column), a unique constraint is
    supported by an underlying **unique
    index**.

    See Also [constraint](glossary.md#glos_constraint), [relational](glossary.md#glos_relational), [unique index](glossary.md#glos_unique_index).

unique index
:   An index on a column or set of columns that have a
    **unique constraint**. Because the
    index is known not to contain any duplicate values, certain
    kinds of lookups and count operations are more efficient than in
    the normal kind of index. Most of the lookups against this type
    of index are simply to determine if a certain value exists or
    not. The number of values in the index is the same as the number
    of rows in the table, or at least the number of rows with
    non-null values for the associated columns.

    **Change buffering** optimization
    does not apply to unique indexes. As a workaround, you can
    temporarily set `unique_checks=0` while doing a
    bulk data load into an `InnoDB` table.

    See Also [cardinality](glossary.md#glos_cardinality), [change buffering](glossary.md#glos_change_buffering), [unique constraint](glossary.md#glos_unique_constraint), [unique key](glossary.md#glos_unique_key).

unique key
:   The set of columns (one or more) comprising a
    **unique index**. When you can
    define a `WHERE` condition that matches exactly
    one row, and the query can use an associated unique index, the
    lookup and error handling can be performed very efficiently.

    See Also [cardinality](glossary.md#glos_cardinality), [unique constraint](glossary.md#glos_unique_constraint), [unique index](glossary.md#glos_unique_index).

UPN
:   See [user principal name](glossary.md#glos_user_principal_name).

user principal name
:   The name for a Kerberos named entity that represents a user.

    See Also [principal](glossary.md#glos_principal).

### V

variable-length type
:   A data type of variable length.
    [`VARCHAR`](char.md "13.3.2 The CHAR and VARCHAR Types"),
    [`VARBINARY`](binary-varbinary.md "13.3.3 The BINARY and VARBINARY Types"), and
    [`BLOB`](blob.md "13.3.4 The BLOB and TEXT Types") and
    [`TEXT`](blob.md "13.3.4 The BLOB and TEXT Types") types are variable-length
    types.

    `InnoDB` treats fixed-length fields greater
    than or equal to 768 bytes in length as variable-length fields,
    which can be stored **off-page**.
    For example, a `CHAR(255)` column can exceed
    768 bytes if the maximum byte length of the character set is
    greater than 3, as it is with `utf8mb4`.

    See Also [off-page column](glossary.md#glos_off_page_column), [overflow page](glossary.md#glos_overflow_page).

victim
:   The **transaction** that is
    automatically chosen to be **rolled
    back** when a **deadlock**
    is detected. `InnoDB` rolls back the
    transaction that has updated the fewest rows.

    **Deadlock detection** can be
    disabled using the
    [`innodb_deadlock_detect`](innodb-parameters.md#sysvar_innodb_deadlock_detect)
    configuration option.

    See Also [deadlock](glossary.md#glos_deadlock), [deadlock detection](glossary.md#glos_deadlock_detection), [innodb\_lock\_wait\_timeout](glossary.md#glos_innodb_lock_wait_timeout), [transaction](glossary.md#glos_transaction).

view
:   A stored query that when invoked produces a result set. A view
    acts as a virtual table.

virtual column
:   See [virtual generated column](glossary.md#glos_virtual_generated_column).

virtual generated column
:   A column whose values are computed from an expression included
    in the column definition. Column values are not stored, but are
    evaluated when rows are read, immediately after any
    `BEFORE` triggers. A virtual generated column
    takes no storage. `InnoDB` supports secondary
    indexes on virtual generated columns.

    Contrast with **stored generated
    column**.

    See Also [base column](glossary.md#glos_base_column), [generated column](glossary.md#glos_generated_column), [stored generated column](glossary.md#glos_stored_generated_column).

virtual index
:   A virtual index is a **secondary
    index** on one or more  **virtual
    generated columns** or on a combination of virtual
    generated columns and regular columns or stored generated
    columns. For more information, see
    [Section 15.1.20.9, “Secondary Indexes and Generated Columns”](create-table-secondary-indexes.md "15.1.20.9 Secondary Indexes and Generated Columns").

    See Also [secondary index](glossary.md#glos_secondary_index), [stored generated column](glossary.md#glos_stored_generated_column), [virtual generated column](glossary.md#glos_virtual_generated_column).

### W

wait
:   When an operation, such as acquiring a
    **lock**,
    **mutex**, or
    **latch**, cannot be completed
    immediately, `InnoDB` pauses and tries again.
    The mechanism for pausing is elaborate enough that this
    operation has its own name, the
    **wait**. Individual threads are
    paused using a combination of internal `InnoDB`
    scheduling, operating system `wait()` calls,
    and short-duration **spin** loops.

    On systems with heavy load and many transactions, you might use
    the output from the `SHOW INNODB STATUS`
    command or **Performance Schema**
    to determine whether threads are spending too much time waiting,
    and if so, how you can improve
    **concurrency**.

    See Also [concurrency](glossary.md#glos_concurrency), [latch](glossary.md#glos_latch), [lock](glossary.md#glos_lock), [mutex](glossary.md#glos_mutex), [Performance Schema](glossary.md#glos_performance_schema), [spin](glossary.md#glos_spin).

warm backup
:   A **backup** taken while the
    database is running, but that restricts some database operations
    during the backup process. For example, tables might become
    read-only. For busy applications and websites, you might prefer
    a **hot backup**.

    See Also [backup](glossary.md#glos_backup), [cold backup](glossary.md#glos_cold_backup), [hot backup](glossary.md#glos_hot_backup).

warm up
:   To run a system under a typical
    **workload** for some time after
    startup, so that the **buffer
    pool** and other memory regions are filled as they
    would be under normal conditions. This process happens naturally
    over time when a MySQL server is restarted or subjected to a new
    workload.

    Typically, you run a workload for some time to warm up the
    buffer pool before running performance tests, to ensure
    consistent results across multiple runs; otherwise, performance
    might be artificially low during the first run.

    In MySQL 5.6, you can speed up the warmup process by enabling
    the
    [`innodb_buffer_pool_dump_at_shutdown`](innodb-parameters.md#sysvar_innodb_buffer_pool_dump_at_shutdown)
    and
    [`innodb_buffer_pool_load_at_startup`](innodb-parameters.md#sysvar_innodb_buffer_pool_load_at_startup)
    configuration options, to bring the contents of the buffer pool
    back into memory after a restart. These options are enabled by
    default in MySQL 5.7. See
    [Section 17.8.3.6, “Saving and Restoring the Buffer Pool State”](innodb-preload-buffer-pool.md "17.8.3.6 Saving and Restoring the Buffer Pool State").

    See Also [buffer pool](glossary.md#glos_buffer_pool), [workload](glossary.md#glos_workload).

workload
:   The combination and volume of
    **SQL** and other database
    operations, performed by a database application during typical
    or peak usage. You can subject the database to a particular
    workload during performance testing to identify
    **bottlenecks**, or during capacity
    planning.

    See Also [bottleneck](glossary.md#glos_bottleneck), [CPU-bound](glossary.md#glos_cpu_bound), [disk-bound](glossary.md#glos_disk_bound), [SQL](glossary.md#glos_sql).

write combining
:   An optimization technique that reduces write operations when
    **dirty pages** are
    **flushed** from the
    `InnoDB` **buffer
    pool**. If a row in a page is updated multiple times,
    or multiple rows on the same page are updated, all of those
    changes are stored to the data files in a single write operation
    rather than one write for each change.

    See Also [buffer pool](glossary.md#glos_buffer_pool), [dirty page](glossary.md#glos_dirty_page), [flush](glossary.md#glos_flush).

### X

XA
:   A standard interface for coordinating distributed
    **transactions**, allowing multiple
    databases to participate in a transaction while maintaining
    **ACID** compliance. For full
    details, see [Section 15.3.8, “XA Transactions”](xa.md "15.3.8 XA Transactions").

    XA Distributed Transaction support is enabled by default.

    See Also [ACID](glossary.md#glos_acid), [binary log](glossary.md#glos_binary_log), [commit](glossary.md#glos_commit), [transaction](glossary.md#glos_transaction), [two-phase commit](glossary.md#glos_two_phase_commit).

### Y

young
:   A characteristic of a **page** in
    the `InnoDB` **buffer
    pool** meaning that it has been accessed recently, and
    so is moved within the buffer pool data structure, so that it is
    not **flushed** too soon by the
    **LRU** algorithm. This term is
    used in some **INFORMATION\_SCHEMA**
    column names of tables related to the buffer pool.

    See Also [buffer pool](glossary.md#glos_buffer_pool), [flush](glossary.md#glos_flush), [INFORMATION\_SCHEMA](glossary.md#glos_information_schema), [LRU](glossary.md#glos_lru), [page](glossary.md#glos_page).
