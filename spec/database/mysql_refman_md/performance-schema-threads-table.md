#### 29.12.21.8 The threads Table

The [`threads`](performance-schema-threads-table.md "29.12.21.8 The threads Table") table contains a row
for each server thread. Each row contains information about a
thread and indicates whether monitoring and historical event
logging are enabled for it:

```sql
mysql> SELECT * FROM performance_schema.threads\G
*************************** 1. row ***************************
            THREAD_ID: 1
                 NAME: thread/sql/main
                 TYPE: BACKGROUND
       PROCESSLIST_ID: NULL
     PROCESSLIST_USER: NULL
     PROCESSLIST_HOST: NULL
       PROCESSLIST_DB: mysql
  PROCESSLIST_COMMAND: NULL

     PARENT_THREAD_ID: NULL
                 ROLE: NULL
         INSTRUMENTED: YES
              HISTORY: YES
      CONNECTION_TYPE: NULL
         THREAD_OS_ID: 5856
       RESOURCE_GROUP: SYS_default
     EXECUTION_ENGINE: PRIMARY

...
```

When the Performance Schema initializes, it populates the
[`threads`](performance-schema-threads-table.md "29.12.21.8 The threads Table") table based on the
threads in existence then. Thereafter, a new row is added each
time the server creates a thread.

The `INSTRUMENTED` and
`HISTORY` column values for new threads are
determined by the contents of the
[`setup_actors`](performance-schema-setup-actors-table.md "29.12.2.1 The setup_actors Table") table. For
information about how to use the
[`setup_actors`](performance-schema-setup-actors-table.md "29.12.2.1 The setup_actors Table") table to control
these columns, see
[Section 29.4.6, “Pre-Filtering by Thread”](performance-schema-thread-filtering.md "29.4.6 Pre-Filtering by Thread").

Removal of rows from the [`threads`](performance-schema-threads-table.md "29.12.21.8 The threads Table")
table occurs when threads end. For a thread associated with a
client session, removal occurs when the session ends. If a
client has auto-reconnect enabled and the session reconnects
after a disconnect, the session becomes associated with a new
row in the [`threads`](performance-schema-threads-table.md "29.12.21.8 The threads Table") table that has
a different `PROCESSLIST_ID` value. The
initial `INSTRUMENTED` and
`HISTORY` values for the new thread may be
different from those of the original thread: The
[`setup_actors`](performance-schema-setup-actors-table.md "29.12.2.1 The setup_actors Table") table may have
changed in the meantime, and if the
`INSTRUMENTED` or `HISTORY`
value for the original thread was changed after the row was
initialized, the change does not carry over to the new thread.

You can enable or disable thread monitoring (that is, whether
events executed by the thread are instrumented) and historical
event logging. To control the initial
`INSTRUMENTED` and `HISTORY`
values for new foreground threads, use the
[`setup_actors`](performance-schema-setup-actors-table.md "29.12.2.1 The setup_actors Table") table. To control
these aspects of existing threads, set the
`INSTRUMENTED` and `HISTORY`
columns of [`threads`](performance-schema-threads-table.md "29.12.21.8 The threads Table") table rows.
(For more information about the conditions under which thread
monitoring and historical event logging occur, see the
descriptions of the `INSTRUMENTED` and
`HISTORY` columns.)

For a comparison of the [`threads`](performance-schema-threads-table.md "29.12.21.8 The threads Table")
table columns with names having a prefix of
`PROCESSLIST_` to other process information
sources, see [Sources of Process Information](processlist-access.md#processlist-sources "Sources of Process Information").

Important

For thread information sources other than the
[`threads`](performance-schema-threads-table.md "29.12.21.8 The threads Table") table, information
about threads for other users is shown only if the current
user has the [`PROCESS`](privileges-provided.md#priv_process)
privilege. That is not true of the
[`threads`](performance-schema-threads-table.md "29.12.21.8 The threads Table") table; all rows are
shown to any user who has the
[`SELECT`](privileges-provided.md#priv_select) privilege for the
table. Users who should not be able to see threads for other
users by accessing the [`threads`](performance-schema-threads-table.md "29.12.21.8 The threads Table")
table should not be given the
[`SELECT`](privileges-provided.md#priv_select) privilege for it.

The [`threads`](performance-schema-threads-table.md "29.12.21.8 The threads Table") table has these
columns:

- `THREAD_ID`

  A unique thread identifier.
- `NAME`

  The name associated with the thread instrumentation code
  in the server. For example,
  `thread/sql/one_connection` corresponds
  to the thread function in the code responsible for
  handling a user connection, and
  `thread/sql/main` stands for the
  `main()` function of the server.
- `TYPE`

  The thread type, either `FOREGROUND` or
  `BACKGROUND`. User connection threads are
  foreground threads. Threads associated with internal
  server activity are background threads. Examples are
  internal `InnoDB` threads, “binlog
  dump” threads sending information to replicas, and
  replication I/O and SQL threads.
- `PROCESSLIST_ID`

  For a foreground thread (associated with a user
  connection), this is the connection identifier. This is
  the same value displayed in the `ID`
  column of the `INFORMATION_SCHEMA`
  [`PROCESSLIST`](information-schema-processlist-table.md "28.3.23 The INFORMATION_SCHEMA PROCESSLIST Table") table, displayed
  in the `Id` column of
  [`SHOW PROCESSLIST`](show-processlist.md "15.7.7.29 SHOW PROCESSLIST Statement") output,
  and returned by the
  [`CONNECTION_ID()`](information-functions.md#function_connection-id) function
  within the thread.

  For a background thread (not associated with a user
  connection), `PROCESSLIST_ID` is
  `NULL`, so the values are not unique.
- `PROCESSLIST_USER`

  The user associated with a foreground thread,
  `NULL` for a background thread.
- `PROCESSLIST_HOST`

  The host name of the client associated with a foreground
  thread, `NULL` for a background thread.

  Unlike the `HOST` column of the
  `INFORMATION_SCHEMA`
  [`PROCESSLIST`](information-schema-processlist-table.md "28.3.23 The INFORMATION_SCHEMA PROCESSLIST Table") table or the
  `Host` column of
  [`SHOW PROCESSLIST`](show-processlist.md "15.7.7.29 SHOW PROCESSLIST Statement") output,
  the `PROCESSLIST_HOST` column does not
  include the port number for TCP/IP connections. To obtain
  this information from the Performance Schema, enable the
  socket instrumentation (which is not enabled by default)
  and examine the
  [`socket_instances`](performance-schema-socket-instances-table.md "29.12.3.5 The socket_instances Table") table:

  ```sql
  mysql> SELECT NAME, ENABLED, TIMED
         FROM performance_schema.setup_instruments
         WHERE NAME LIKE 'wait/io/socket%';
  +----------------------------------------+---------+-------+
  | NAME                                   | ENABLED | TIMED |
  +----------------------------------------+---------+-------+
  | wait/io/socket/sql/server_tcpip_socket | NO      | NO    |
  | wait/io/socket/sql/server_unix_socket  | NO      | NO    |
  | wait/io/socket/sql/client_connection   | NO      | NO    |
  +----------------------------------------+---------+-------+
  3 rows in set (0.01 sec)

  mysql> UPDATE performance_schema.setup_instruments
         SET ENABLED='YES'
         WHERE NAME LIKE 'wait/io/socket%';
  Query OK, 3 rows affected (0.00 sec)
  Rows matched: 3  Changed: 3  Warnings: 0

  mysql> SELECT * FROM performance_schema.socket_instances\G
  *************************** 1. row ***************************
             EVENT_NAME: wait/io/socket/sql/client_connection
  OBJECT_INSTANCE_BEGIN: 140612577298432
              THREAD_ID: 31
              SOCKET_ID: 53
                     IP: ::ffff:127.0.0.1
                   PORT: 55642
                  STATE: ACTIVE
  ...
  ```
- `PROCESSLIST_DB`

  The default database for the thread, or
  `NULL` if none has been selected.
- `PROCESSLIST_COMMAND`

  For foreground threads, the type of command the thread is
  executing on behalf of the client, or
  `Sleep` if the session is idle. For
  descriptions of thread commands, see
  [Section 10.14, “Examining Server Thread (Process) Information”](thread-information.md "10.14 Examining Server Thread (Process) Information"). The value of this
  column corresponds to the
  `COM_xxx`
  commands of the client/server protocol and
  `Com_xxx`
  status variables. See
  [Section 7.1.10, “Server Status Variables”](server-status-variables.md "7.1.10 Server Status Variables")

  Background threads do not execute commands on behalf of
  clients, so this column may be `NULL`.
- `PROCESSLIST_TIME`

  The time in seconds that the thread has been in its
  current state. For a replica SQL thread, the value is the
  number of seconds between the timestamp of the last
  replicated event and the real time of the replica host.
  See [Section 19.2.3, “Replication Threads”](replication-threads.md "19.2.3 Replication Threads").
- `PROCESSLIST_STATE`

  An action, event, or state that indicates what the thread
  is doing. For descriptions of
  `PROCESSLIST_STATE` values, see
  [Section 10.14, “Examining Server Thread (Process) Information”](thread-information.md "10.14 Examining Server Thread (Process) Information"). If the value if
  `NULL`, the thread may correspond to an
  idle client session or the work it is doing is not
  instrumented with stages.

  Most states correspond to very quick operations. If a
  thread stays in a given state for many seconds, there
  might be a problem that bears investigation.
- `PROCESSLIST_INFO`

  The statement the thread is executing, or
  `NULL` if it is executing no statement.
  The statement might be the one sent to the server, or an
  innermost statement if the statement executes other
  statements. For example, if a `CALL`
  statement executes a stored procedure that is executing a
  [`SELECT`](select.md "15.2.13 SELECT Statement") statement, the
  `PROCESSLIST_INFO` value shows the
  [`SELECT`](select.md "15.2.13 SELECT Statement") statement.
- `PARENT_THREAD_ID`

  If this thread is a subthread (spawned by another thread),
  this is the `THREAD_ID` value of the
  spawning thread.
- `ROLE`

  Unused.
- `INSTRUMENTED`

  Whether events executed by the thread are instrumented.
  The value is `YES` or
  `NO`.

  - For foreground threads, the initial
    `INSTRUMENTED` value is determined by
    whether the user account associated with the thread
    matches any row in the
    [`setup_actors`](performance-schema-setup-actors-table.md "29.12.2.1 The setup_actors Table") table.
    Matching is based on the values of the
    `PROCESSLIST_USER` and
    `PROCESSLIST_HOST` columns.

    If the thread spawns a subthread, matching occurs
    again for the [`threads`](performance-schema-threads-table.md "29.12.21.8 The threads Table")
    table row created for the subthread.
  - For background threads,
    `INSTRUMENTED` is
    `YES` by default.
    [`setup_actors`](performance-schema-setup-actors-table.md "29.12.2.1 The setup_actors Table") is not
    consulted because there is no associated user for
    background threads.
  - For any thread, its `INSTRUMENTED`
    value can be changed during the lifetime of the
    thread.

  For monitoring of events executed by the thread to occur,
  these things must be true:

  - The `thread_instrumentation` consumer
    in the [`setup_consumers`](performance-schema-setup-consumers-table.md "29.12.2.2 The setup_consumers Table")
    table must be `YES`.
  - The `threads.INSTRUMENTED` column
    must be `YES`.
  - Monitoring occurs only for those thread events
    produced from instruments that have the
    `ENABLED` column set to
    `YES` in the
    [`setup_instruments`](performance-schema-setup-instruments-table.md "29.12.2.3 The setup_instruments Table") table.
- `HISTORY`

  Whether to log historical events for the thread. The value
  is `YES` or `NO`.

  - For foreground threads, the initial
    `HISTORY` value is determined by
    whether the user account associated with the thread
    matches any row in the
    [`setup_actors`](performance-schema-setup-actors-table.md "29.12.2.1 The setup_actors Table") table.
    Matching is based on the values of the
    `PROCESSLIST_USER` and
    `PROCESSLIST_HOST` columns.

    If the thread spawns a subthread, matching occurs
    again for the [`threads`](performance-schema-threads-table.md "29.12.21.8 The threads Table")
    table row created for the subthread.
  - For background threads, `HISTORY` is
    `YES` by default.
    [`setup_actors`](performance-schema-setup-actors-table.md "29.12.2.1 The setup_actors Table") is not
    consulted because there is no associated user for
    background threads.
  - For any thread, its `HISTORY` value
    can be changed during the lifetime of the thread.

  For historical event logging for the thread to occur,
  these things must be true:

  - The appropriate history-related consumers in the
    [`setup_consumers`](performance-schema-setup-consumers-table.md "29.12.2.2 The setup_consumers Table") table
    must be enabled. For example, wait event logging in
    the [`events_waits_history`](performance-schema-events-waits-history-table.md "29.12.4.2 The events_waits_history Table")
    and
    [`events_waits_history_long`](performance-schema-events-waits-history-long-table.md "29.12.4.3 The events_waits_history_long Table")
    tables requires the corresponding
    `events_waits_history` and
    `events_waits_history_long` consumers
    to be `YES`.
  - The `threads.HISTORY` column must be
    `YES`.
  - Logging occurs only for those thread events produced
    from instruments that have the
    `ENABLED` column set to
    `YES` in the
    [`setup_instruments`](performance-schema-setup-instruments-table.md "29.12.2.3 The setup_instruments Table") table.
- `CONNECTION_TYPE`

  The protocol used to establish the connection, or
  `NULL` for background threads. Permitted
  values are `TCP/IP` (TCP/IP connection
  established without encryption),
  `SSL/TLS` (TCP/IP connection established
  with encryption), `Socket` (Unix socket
  file connection), `Named Pipe` (Windows
  named pipe connection), and `Shared
  Memory` (Windows shared memory connection).
- `THREAD_OS_ID`

  The thread or task identifier as defined by the underlying
  operating system, if there is one:

  - When a MySQL thread is associated with the same
    operating system thread for its lifetime,
    `THREAD_OS_ID` contains the operating
    system thread ID.
  - When a MySQL thread is not associated with the same
    operating system thread for its lifetime,
    `THREAD_OS_ID` contains
    `NULL`. This is typical for user
    sessions when the thread pool plugin is used (see
    [Section 7.6.3, “MySQL Enterprise Thread Pool”](thread-pool.md "7.6.3 MySQL Enterprise Thread Pool")).

  For Windows, `THREAD_OS_ID` corresponds
  to the thread ID visible in Process Explorer
  (<https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/bb896653.aspx>).

  For Linux, `THREAD_OS_ID` corresponds to
  the value of the `gettid()` function.
  This value is exposed, for example, using the
  **perf** or **ps -L**
  commands, or in the `proc` file system
  (`/proc/[pid]/task/[tid]`).
  For more information, see the
  `perf-stat(1)`, `ps(1)`,
  and `proc(5)` man pages.
- `RESOURCE_GROUP`

  The resource group label. This value is
  `NULL` if resource groups are not
  supported on the current platform or server configuration
  (see [Resource Group Restrictions](resource-groups.md#resource-group-restrictions "Resource Group Restrictions")).
- `EXECUTION_ENGINE`

  The query execution engine. The value is either
  `PRIMARY` or
  `SECONDARY`. For use with MySQL HeatWave Service and
  MySQL HeatWave, where the `PRIMARY` engine is
  `InnoDB` and the
  `SECONDARY` engine is MySQL HeatWave
  (`RAPID`). For MySQL Community Edition Server, MySQL Enterprise Edition Server
  (on-premise), and MySQL HeatWave Service without MySQL HeatWave, the value is
  always `PRIMARY`. This column was added
  in MySQL 8.0.29.
- `CONTROLLED_MEMORY`

  Amount of controlled memory used by the thread.

  This column was added in MySQL 8.0.31.
- `MAX_CONTROLLED_MEMORY`

  Maximum value of `CONTROLLED_MEMORY` seen
  during the thread execution.

  This column was added in MySQL 8.0.31.
- `TOTAL_MEMORY`

  The current amount of memory, controlled or not, used by
  the thread.

  This column was added in MySQL 8.0.31.
- `MAX_TOTAL_MEMORY`

  The maximum value of `TOTAL_MEMORY` seen
  during the thread execution.

  This column was added in MySQL 8.0.31.
- `TELEMETRY_ACTIVE`

  Whether the thread has an active telemetry seesion
  attached. The value is `YES` or
  `NO`.

  This column was added in MySQL 8.0.33.

The [`threads`](performance-schema-threads-table.md "29.12.21.8 The threads Table") table has these
indexes:

- Primary key on (`THREAD_ID`)
- Index on (`NAME`)
- Index on (`PROCESSLIST_ID`)
- Index on (`PROCESSLIST_USER`,
  `PROCESSLIST_HOST`)
- Index on (`PROCESSLIST_HOST`)
- Index on (`THREAD_OS_ID`)
- Index on (`RESOURCE_GROUP`)

[`TRUNCATE TABLE`](truncate-table.md "15.1.37 TRUNCATE TABLE Statement") is not permitted
for the [`threads`](performance-schema-threads-table.md "29.12.21.8 The threads Table") table.
