### 20.7.9 Monitoring Group Replication Memory Usage with Performance Schema Memory Instrumentation

[20.7.9.1 Enabling or Disabling Group Replication Instrumentation](mysql-gr-memory-monitoring-ps-instruments-enable.md)

[20.7.9.2 Example Queries](mysql-gr-memory-monitoring-ps-sample-queries.md)

From MySQL 8.0.30, [Performance
Schema](performance-schema.md "Chapter 29 MySQL Performance Schema") provides instrumentation for performance monitoring
of Group Replication memory usage. To view the available Group
Replication instrumentation, issue the following query:

```sql
mysql> SELECT NAME,ENABLED FROM performance_schema.setup_instruments
       WHERE NAME LIKE 'memory/group_rpl/%';
+-------------------------------------------------------------------+---------+

#### Performance Schema Group Replication instruments memory allocation for Group Replication.

The `memory/group_rpl/` Performance Schema
instrumentation was updated in 8.0.30 to extend monitoring of
Group Replication memory usage.
`memory/group_rpl/` contains the following
instruments:

- `write_set_encoded`: Memory allocated to
  encode the write set before it is broadcast to the group
  members.
- `Gcs_message_data::m_buffer`: Memory
  allocated for the transaction data payload sent to the
  network.
- `certification_data`: Memory allocated for
  certification of incoming transactions.
- `certification_data_gc`: Memory allocated for
  the GTID\_EXECUTED sent by each member for garbage collection.
- `certification_info`: Memory allocated for
  storage of certification information allocated to resolve
  conflicts between concurrent transactions.
- `transaction_data`: Memory allocated for
  incoming transactions queued for the plugin pipeline.
- `message_service_received_message`: Memory
  allocated to receiving messages from Group Replication
  delivery message service.
- `sql_service_command_data`: Memory allocated
  for processing the queue of internal SQL service commands.
- `mysql_thread_queued_task`: Memory allocated
  when a MySQL-thread dependent task is added to the processing
  queue.
- `message_service_queue`: Memory allocated for
  queued messages of the Group Replication delivery message
  service.
- `GCS_XCom::xcom_cache`: Memory allocated to
  XCOM ache for messaging and metadata exchanged between group
  members as part of the consensus protocol.
- `consistent_members_that_must_prepare_transaction`:
  Memory allocated to hold list of members preparing transaction
  for Group Replication transaction consistency guarantees.
- `consistent_transactions`: Memory allocated
  to hold transaction and list of members that must prepare that
  transaction for Group Replication transaction consistency
  guarantees.
- `consistent_transactions_prepared`: Memory
  allocated to hold list of transaction's info prepared for the
  Group Replication Transaction Consistency Guarantees.
- `consistent_transactions_waiting`: Memory
  allocated to hold information on a list of transactions while
  preceding prepared transactions with consistency of
  `AFTER` and
  `BEFORE_AND_AFTER` are processed.
- `consistent_transactions_delayed_view_change`:
  Memory allocated to hold list of view change events
  (`view_change_log_event`) delayed by prepared
  consistent transactions waiting for prepare acknowledgement.
- `group_member_info`: Memory allocated to hold
  the group member properties. Properties such as hostname,
  port, member weight and role, and so on.

The following instruments in the `memory/sql/`
grouping are also used to monitor Group Replication memory:

- `Log_event`: Memory allocated for encoding
  transaction data into the binary log format; this is the same
  format in which Group Replication transmits data.
- `write_set_extraction`: Memory allocated to
  the transaction's generated write set before it is committed.
- `Gtid_set::to_string`: Memory allocated to
  stored the string representation of a GTID set.
- `Gtid_set::Interval_chunk`: Memory allocated
  to store the GTID object.
