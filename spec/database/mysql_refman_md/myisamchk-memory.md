#### 6.6.4.6 myisamchk Memory Usage

Memory allocation is important when you run
[**myisamchk**](myisamchk.md "6.6.4 myisamchk — MyISAM Table-Maintenance Utility"). [**myisamchk**](myisamchk.md "6.6.4 myisamchk — MyISAM Table-Maintenance Utility") uses
no more memory than its memory-related variables are set to. If
you are going to use [**myisamchk**](myisamchk.md "6.6.4 myisamchk — MyISAM Table-Maintenance Utility") on very large
tables, you should first decide how much memory you want it to
use. The default is to use only about 3MB to perform repairs. By
using larger values, you can get [**myisamchk**](myisamchk.md "6.6.4 myisamchk — MyISAM Table-Maintenance Utility") to
operate faster. For example, if you have more than 512MB RAM
available, you could use options such as these (in addition to
any other options you might specify):

```terminal
myisamchk --myisam_sort_buffer_size=256M \
           --key_buffer_size=512M \
           --read_buffer_size=64M \
           --write_buffer_size=64M ...
```

Using `--myisam_sort_buffer_size=16M` is probably
enough for most cases.

Be aware that [**myisamchk**](myisamchk.md "6.6.4 myisamchk — MyISAM Table-Maintenance Utility") uses temporary files
in `TMPDIR`. If `TMPDIR`
points to a memory file system, out of memory errors can easily
occur. If this happens, run [**myisamchk**](myisamchk.md "6.6.4 myisamchk — MyISAM Table-Maintenance Utility") with
the
[`--tmpdir=dir_name`](myisamchk-repair-options.md#option_myisamchk_tmpdir)
option to specify a directory located on a file system that has
more space.

When performing repair operations, [**myisamchk**](myisamchk.md "6.6.4 myisamchk — MyISAM Table-Maintenance Utility")
also needs a lot of disk space:

- Twice the size of the data file (the original file and a
  copy). This space is not needed if you do a repair with
  [`--quick`](myisamchk-repair-options.md#option_myisamchk_quick); in this case,
  only the index file is re-created. *This space must
  be available on the same file system as the original data
  file*, as the copy is created in the same
  directory as the original.
- Space for the new index file that replaces the old one. The
  old index file is truncated at the start of the repair
  operation, so you usually ignore this space. This space must
  be available on the same file system as the original data
  file.
- When using [`--recover`](myisamchk-repair-options.md#option_myisamchk_recover) or
  [`--sort-recover`](myisamchk-repair-options.md#option_myisamchk_sort-recover) (but not
  when using
  [`--safe-recover`](myisamchk-repair-options.md#option_myisamchk_safe-recover)), you need
  space on disk for sorting. This space is allocated in the
  temporary directory (specified by `TMPDIR`
  or
  [`--tmpdir=dir_name`](myisamchk-repair-options.md#option_myisamchk_tmpdir)).
  The following formula yields the amount of space required:

  ```clike
  (largest_key + row_pointer_length) * number_of_rows * 2
  ```

  You can check the length of the keys and the
  *`row_pointer_length`* with
  [**myisamchk -dv
  *`tbl_name`***](myisamchk.md "6.6.4 myisamchk — MyISAM Table-Maintenance Utility") (see
  [Section 6.6.4.5, “Obtaining Table Information with myisamchk”](myisamchk-table-info.md "6.6.4.5 Obtaining Table Information with myisamchk")). The
  *`row_pointer_length`* and
  *`number_of_rows`* values are the
  `Datafile pointer` and `Data
  records` values in the table description. To
  determine the *`largest_key`* value,
  check the `Key` lines in the table
  description. The `Len` column indicates the
  number of bytes for each key part. For a multiple-column
  index, the key size is the sum of the `Len`
  values for all key parts.

If you have a problem with disk space during repair, you can try
[`--safe-recover`](myisamchk-repair-options.md#option_myisamchk_safe-recover) instead of
[`--recover`](myisamchk-repair-options.md#option_myisamchk_recover).
