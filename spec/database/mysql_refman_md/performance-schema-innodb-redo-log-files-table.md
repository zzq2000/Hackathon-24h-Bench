#### 29.12.21.4 The innodb\_redo\_log\_files Table

The `innodb_redo_log_files` table contains a
row for each active `InnoDB` redo log file.
This table was introduced in MySQL 8.0.30.

The `innodb_redo_log_files` table has the
following columns:

- `FILE_ID`

  The ID of the redo log file. The value corresponds to the
  redo log file number.
- `FILE_NAME`

  The path and file name of the redo log file.
- `START_LSN`

  The log sequence number of the first block in the redo log
  file.
- `END_LSN`

  The log sequence number after the last block in the redo
  log file.
- `SIZE_IN_BYTES`

  The size of the redo log data in the file, in bytes. Data
  size is measured from the `END_LSN` to
  the start `>START_LSN`. The redo log file
  size on disk is slightly larger due to the file header
  (2048 bytes), which is not included in the value reported
  by this column.
- `IS_FULL`

  Whether the redo log file is full. A value of 0 indicates
  that free space in the file. A value of 1 indicates that
  the file is full.
- `CONSUMER_LEVEL`

  Reserved for future use.
