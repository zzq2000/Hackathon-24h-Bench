#### 15.7.7.35 SHOW REPLICA STATUS Statement

```sql
SHOW {REPLICA | SLAVE} STATUS [FOR CHANNEL channel]
```

This statement provides status information on essential
parameters of the replica threads. From MySQL 8.0.22, use
[`SHOW REPLICA STATUS`](show-replica-status.md "15.7.7.35 SHOW REPLICA STATUS Statement") in place of
[`SHOW SLAVE STATUS`](show-slave-status.md "15.7.7.36 SHOW SLAVE | REPLICA STATUS Statement"), which is
deprecated from that release. In releases before MySQL 8.0.22,
use [`SHOW SLAVE STATUS`](show-slave-status.md "15.7.7.36 SHOW SLAVE | REPLICA STATUS Statement"). The
statement requires the [`REPLICATION
CLIENT`](privileges-provided.md#priv_replication-client) privilege (or the deprecated
[`SUPER`](privileges-provided.md#priv_super) privilege).

`SHOW REPLICA STATUS` is nonblocking. When run
concurrently with
[`STOP
REPLICA`](stop-replica.md "15.4.2.8 STOP REPLICA Statement"), `SHOW REPLICA STATUS`
returns without waiting for
[`STOP
REPLICA`](stop-replica.md "15.4.2.8 STOP REPLICA Statement") to finish shutting down the replication SQL
(applier) thread or replication I/O (receiver) thread (or both).
This permits use in monitoring and other applications where
getting an immediate response from `SHOW REPLICA
STATUS` is more important than ensuring that it
returned the latest data. The SLAVE keyword was replaced with
REPLICA in MySQL 8.0.22.

If you issue this statement using the [**mysql**](mysql.md "6.5.1 mysql — The MySQL Command-Line Client")
client, you can use a `\G` statement terminator
rather than a semicolon to obtain a more readable vertical
layout:

```sql

The Performance Schema provides tables that expose replication
information. This is similar to the information available from
the [`SHOW REPLICA STATUS`](show-replica-status.md "15.7.7.35 SHOW REPLICA STATUS Statement")
statement, but represented in table form. For details, see
[Section 29.12.11, “Performance Schema Replication Tables”](performance-schema-replication-tables.md "29.12.11 Performance Schema Replication Tables").

From MySQL 8.0.27, you can set the `GTID_ONLY`
option on the [`CHANGE REPLICATION SOURCE
TO`](change-replication-source-to.md "15.4.2.3 CHANGE REPLICATION SOURCE TO Statement") statement to stop a replication channel from
persisting file names and file positions in the replication
metadata repositories. With this setting, file positions for the
source binary log file and the relay log file are tracked in
memory. The
[`SHOW
REPLICA STATUS`](show-replica-status.md "15.7.7.35 SHOW REPLICA STATUS Statement") statement still displays file positions
in normal use. However, because the file positions are not being
regularly updated in the connection metadata repository and the
applier metadata repository except in a few situations, they are
likely to be out of date if the server is restarted.

For a replication channel with the `GTID_ONLY`
setting after a server start, the read and applied file
positions for the source binary log file
(`Read_Source_Log_Pos` and
`Exec_Source_Log_Pos`) are set to zero, and the
file names (`Source_Log_File` and
`Relay_Source_Log_File`) are set to
`INVALID`. The relay log file name
(`Relay_Log_File`) is set according to the
relay\_log\_recovery setting, either a new file that was created
at server start or the first relay log file present. The file
position (`Relay_Log_Pos`) is set to position
4, and GTID auto-skip is used to skip any transactions in the
file that were already applied.

When the receiver thread contacts the source and gets valid
position information, the read position
(`Read_Source_Log_Pos`) and file name
(`Source_Log_File`) are updated with the
correct data and become valid. When the applier thread applies a
transaction from the source, or skips an already executed
transaction, the executed position
(`Exec_Source_Log_Pos`) and file name
(`Relay_Source_Log_File`) are updated with the
correct data and become valid. The relay log file position
(`Relay_Log_Pos`) is also updated at that time.

The following list describes the fields returned by
[`SHOW
REPLICA STATUS`](show-replica-status.md "15.7.7.35 SHOW REPLICA STATUS Statement"). For additional information about
interpreting their meanings, see
[Section 19.1.7.1, “Checking Replication Status”](replication-administration-status.md "19.1.7.1 Checking Replication Status").

- `Replica_IO_State`

  A copy of the `State` field of the
  [`SHOW PROCESSLIST`](show-processlist.md "15.7.7.29 SHOW PROCESSLIST Statement") output for
  the replica I/O (receiver) thread. This tells you what the
  thread is doing: trying to connect to the source, waiting
  for events from the source, reconnecting to the source, and
  so on. For a listing of possible states, see
  [Section 10.14.5, “Replication I/O (Receiver) Thread States”](replica-io-thread-states.md "10.14.5 Replication I/O (Receiver) Thread States").
- `Source_Host`

  The source host that the replica is connected to.
- `Source_User`

  The user name of the account used to connect to the source.
- `Source_Port`

  The port used to connect to the source.
- `Connect_Retry`

  The number of seconds between connect retries (default 60).
  This can be set with a [`CHANGE
  REPLICATION SOURCE TO`](change-replication-source-to.md "15.4.2.3 CHANGE REPLICATION SOURCE TO Statement") statement (from MySQL
  8.0.23) or [`CHANGE MASTER TO`](change-master-to.md "15.4.2.1 CHANGE MASTER TO Statement")
  statement (before MySQL 8.0.23).
- `Source_Log_File`

  The name of the source binary log file from which the I/O
  (receiver) thread is currently reading. This is set to
  `INVALID` for a replication channel with
  the `GTID_ONLY` setting after a server
  start. It will be updated when the replica contacts the
  source.
- `Read_Source_Log_Pos`

  The position in the current source binary log file up to
  which the I/O (receiver) thread has read. This is set to
  zero for a replication channel with the
  `GTID_ONLY` setting after a server start.
  It will be updated when the replica contacts the source.
- `Relay_Log_File`

  The name of the relay log file from which the SQL (applier)
  thread is currently reading and executing.
- `Relay_Log_Pos`

  The position in the current relay log file up to which the
  SQL (applier) thread has read and executed.
- `Relay_Source_Log_File`

  The name of the source binary log file containing the most
  recent event executed by the SQL (applier) thread. This is
  set to `INVALID` for a replication channel
  with the `GTID_ONLY` setting after a server
  start. It will be updated when a transaction is executed or
  skipped.
- `Replica_IO_Running`

  Whether the replication I/O (receiver) thread is started and
  has connected successfully to the source. Internally, the
  state of this thread is represented by one of the following
  three values:

  - **MYSQL\_REPLICA\_NOT\_RUN.**
    The replication I/O (receiver) thread is not running.
    For this state, `Replica_IO_Running`
    is `No`.
  - **MYSQL\_REPLICA\_RUN\_NOT\_CONNECT.**
    The replication I/O (receiver) thread is running, but
    is not connected to a replication source. For this
    state, `Replica_IO_Running` is
    `Connecting`.
  - **MYSQL\_REPLICA\_RUN\_CONNECT.**
    The replication I/O (receiver) thread is running, and
    is connected to a replication source. For this state,
    `Replica_IO_Running` is
    `Yes`.
- `Replica_SQL_Running`

  Whether the replication SQL (applier) thread is started.
- `Replicate_Do_DB`,
  `Replicate_Ignore_DB`

  The names of any databases that were specified with the
  [`--replicate-do-db`](replication-options-replica.md#option_mysqld_replicate-do-db) and
  [`--replicate-ignore-db`](replication-options-replica.md#option_mysqld_replicate-ignore-db)
  options, or the [`CHANGE REPLICATION
  FILTER`](change-replication-filter.md "15.4.2.2 CHANGE REPLICATION FILTER Statement") statement. If the `FOR
  CHANNEL` clause was used, the channel specific
  replication filters are shown. Otherwise, the replication
  filters for every replication channel are shown.
- `Replicate_Do_Table`,
  `Replicate_Ignore_Table`,
  `Replicate_Wild_Do_Table`,
  `Replicate_Wild_Ignore_Table`

  The names of any tables that were specified with the
  [`--replicate-do-table`](replication-options-replica.md#option_mysqld_replicate-do-table),
  [`--replicate-ignore-table`](replication-options-replica.md#option_mysqld_replicate-ignore-table),
  [`--replicate-wild-do-table`](replication-options-replica.md#option_mysqld_replicate-wild-do-table),
  and
  [`--replicate-wild-ignore-table`](replication-options-replica.md#option_mysqld_replicate-wild-ignore-table)
  options, or the [`CHANGE REPLICATION
  FILTER`](change-replication-filter.md "15.4.2.2 CHANGE REPLICATION FILTER Statement") statement. If the `FOR
  CHANNEL` clause was used, the channel specific
  replication filters are shown. Otherwise, the replication
  filters for every replication channel are shown.
- `Last_Errno`, `Last_Error`

  These columns are aliases for
  `Last_SQL_Errno` and
  `Last_SQL_Error`.

  Issuing [`RESET MASTER`](reset-master.md "15.4.1.2 RESET MASTER Statement") or
  [`RESET
  REPLICA`](reset-replica.md "15.4.2.4 RESET REPLICA Statement") resets the values shown in these columns.

  Note

  When the replication SQL thread receives an error, it
  reports the error first, then stops the SQL thread. This
  means that there is a small window of time during which
  `SHOW REPLICA STATUS` shows a nonzero
  value for `Last_SQL_Errno` even though
  `Replica_SQL_Running` still displays
  `Yes`.
- `Skip_Counter`

  The current value of the
  [`sql_slave_skip_counter`](replication-options-replica.md#sysvar_sql_slave_skip_counter)
  system variable. See
  [SET GLOBAL sql\_slave\_skip\_counter Syntax](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/set-global-sql-slave-skip-counter.html).
- `Exec_Source_Log_Pos`

  The position in the current source binary log file to which
  the replication SQL thread has read and executed, marking
  the start of the next transaction or event to be processed.
  This is set to zero for a replication channel with the
  `GTID_ONLY` setting after a server start.
  It will be updated when a transaction is executed or
  skipped.

  You can use this value with the [`CHANGE
  REPLICATION SOURCE TO`](change-replication-source-to.md "15.4.2.3 CHANGE REPLICATION SOURCE TO Statement") statement's
  `SOURCE_LOG_POS` option (from MySQL 8.0.23)
  or the [`CHANGE MASTER
  TO`](change-master-to.md "15.4.2.1 CHANGE MASTER TO Statement") statement's
  `MASTER_LOG_POS` option (before MySQL
  8.0.23) when starting a new replica from an existing
  replica, so that the new replica reads from this point. The
  coordinates given by
  (`Relay_Source_Log_File`,
  `Exec_Source_Log_Pos`) in the source's
  binary log correspond to the coordinates given by
  (`Relay_Log_File`,
  `Relay_Log_Pos`) in the relay log.

  Inconsistencies in the sequence of transactions from the
  relay log which have been executed can cause this value to
  be a “low-water mark”. In other words,
  transactions appearing before the position are guaranteed to
  have committed, but transactions after the position may have
  committed or not. If these gaps need to be corrected, use
  [`START REPLICA
  UNTIL SQL_AFTER_MTS_GAPS`](start-replica.md "15.4.2.6 START REPLICA Statement"). See
  [Section 19.5.1.34, “Replication and Transaction Inconsistencies”](replication-features-transaction-inconsistencies.md "19.5.1.34 Replication and Transaction Inconsistencies")
  for more information.
- `Relay_Log_Space`

  The total combined size of all existing relay log files.
- `Until_Condition`,
  `Until_Log_File`,
  `Until_Log_Pos`

  The values specified in the `UNTIL` clause
  of the [`START
  REPLICA`](start-replica.md "15.4.2.6 START REPLICA Statement") statement.

  `Until_Condition` has these values:

  - `None` if no `UNTIL`
    clause was specified.
  - `Source` if the replica is reading
    until a given position in the source's binary log.
  - `Relay` if the replica is reading until
    a given position in its relay log.
  - `SQL_BEFORE_GTIDS` if the replication
    SQL thread is processing transactions until it has
    reached the first transaction whose GTID is listed in
    the `gtid_set`.
  - `SQL_AFTER_GTIDS` if the replication
    threads are processing all transactions until the last
    transaction in the `gtid_set` has been
    processed by both threads.
  - `SQL_AFTER_MTS_GAPS` if a multithreaded
    replica's SQL threads are running until no more gaps are
    found in the relay log.

  `Until_Log_File` and
  `Until_Log_Pos` indicate the log file name
  and position that define the coordinates at which the
  replication SQL thread stops executing.

  For more information on `UNTIL` clauses,
  see [Section 15.4.2.7, “START SLAVE Statement”](start-slave.md "15.4.2.7 START SLAVE Statement").
- `Source_SSL_Allowed`,
  `Source_SSL_CA_File`,
  `Source_SSL_CA_Path`,
  `Source_SSL_Cert`,
  `Source_SSL_Cipher`,
  `Source_SSL_CRL_File`,
  `Source_SSL_CRL_Path`,
  `Source_SSL_Key`,
  `Source_SSL_Verify_Server_Cert`

  These fields show the SSL parameters used by the replica to
  connect to the source, if any.

  `Source_SSL_Allowed` has these values:

  - `Yes` if an SSL connection to the
    source is permitted.
  - `No` if an SSL connection to the source
    is not permitted.
  - `Ignored` if an SSL connection is
    permitted but the replica server does not have SSL
    support enabled.

  The values of the other SSL-related fields correspond to the
  values of the `SOURCE_SSL_*` options of the
  [`CHANGE REPLICATION SOURCE TO`](change-replication-source-to.md "15.4.2.3 CHANGE REPLICATION SOURCE TO Statement")
  statement (from MySQL 8.0.23), or the
  `MASTER_SSL_*` options of the
  [`CHANGE MASTER TO`](change-master-to.md "15.4.2.1 CHANGE MASTER TO Statement") statement
  (before MySQL 8.0.23). See
  [Section 15.4.2.1, “CHANGE MASTER TO Statement”](change-master-to.md "15.4.2.1 CHANGE MASTER TO Statement").
- `Seconds_Behind_Source`

  This field is an indication of how “late” the
  replica is:

  - When the replica is actively processing updates, this
    field shows the difference between the current timestamp
    on the replica and the original timestamp logged on the
    source for the event currently being processed on the
    replica.
  - When no event is currently being processed on the
    replica, this value is 0.

  In essence, this field measures the time difference in
  seconds between the replication SQL (applier) thread and the
  replication I/O (receiver) thread. If the network connection
  between source and replica is fast, the replication receiver
  thread is very close to the source, so this field is a good
  approximation of how late the replication applier thread is
  compared to the source. If the network is slow, this is
  *not* a good approximation; the
  replication applier thread may quite often be caught up with
  the slow-reading replication receiver thread, so
  `Seconds_Behind_Source` often shows a value
  of 0, even if the replication receiver thread is late
  compared to the source. In other words, *this
  column is useful only for fast networks*.

  This time difference computation works even if the source
  and replica do not have identical clock times, provided that
  the difference, computed when the replica receiver thread
  starts, remains constant from then on. Any changes,
  including NTP updates, can lead to clock skews that can make
  calculation of `Seconds_Behind_Source` less
  reliable.

  In MySQL 8.0, this field is
  `NULL` (undefined or unknown) if the
  replication applier thread is not running, or if the applier
  thread has consumed all of the relay log and the replication
  receiver thread is not running. (In older versions of MySQL,
  this field was `NULL` if the replication
  applier thread or the replication receiver thread was not
  running or was not connected to the source.) If the
  replication receiver thread is running but the relay log is
  exhausted, `Seconds_Behind_Source` is set
  to 0.

  The value of `Seconds_Behind_Source` is
  based on the timestamps stored in events, which are
  preserved through replication. This means that if a source
  M1 is itself a replica of M0, any event from M1's binary log
  that originates from M0's binary log has M0's timestamp for
  that event. This enables MySQL to replicate
  [`TIMESTAMP`](datetime.md "13.2.2 The DATE, DATETIME, and TIMESTAMP Types") successfully.
  However, the problem for
  `Seconds_Behind_Source` is that if M1 also
  receives direct updates from clients, the
  `Seconds_Behind_Source` value randomly
  fluctuates because sometimes the last event from M1
  originates from M0 and sometimes is the result of a direct
  update on M1.

  When using a multithreaded replica, you should keep in mind
  that this value is based on
  `Exec_Source_Log_Pos`, and so may not
  reflect the position of the most recently committed
  transaction.
- `Last_IO_Errno`,
  `Last_IO_Error`

  The error number and error message of the most recent error
  that caused the replication I/O (receiver) thread to stop.
  An error number of 0 and message of the empty string mean
  “no error.” If the
  `Last_IO_Error` value is not empty, the
  error values also appear in the replica's error log.

  I/O error information includes a timestamp showing when the
  most recent I/O (receiver)thread error occurred. This
  timestamp uses the format *`YYMMDD
  hh:mm:ss`*, and appears in the
  `Last_IO_Error_Timestamp` column.

  Issuing [`RESET MASTER`](reset-master.md "15.4.1.2 RESET MASTER Statement") or
  [`RESET
  REPLICA`](reset-replica.md "15.4.2.4 RESET REPLICA Statement") resets the values shown in these columns.
- `Last_SQL_Errno`,
  `Last_SQL_Error`

  The error number and error message of the most recent error
  that caused the replication SQL (applier) thread to stop. An
  error number of 0 and message of the empty string mean
  “no error.” If the
  `Last_SQL_Error` value is not empty, the
  error values also appear in the replica's error log.

  If the replica is multithreaded, the replication SQL thread
  is the coordinator for worker threads. In this case, the
  `Last_SQL_Error` field shows exactly what
  the `Last_Error_Message` column in the
  Performance Schema
  [`replication_applier_status_by_coordinator`](performance-schema-replication-applier-status-by-coordinator-table.md "29.12.11.4 The replication_applier_status_by_coordinator Table")
  table shows. The field value is modified to suggest that
  there may be more failures in the other worker threads which
  can be seen in the
  [`replication_applier_status_by_worker`](performance-schema-replication-applier-status-by-worker-table.md "29.12.11.5 The replication_applier_status_by_worker Table")
  table that shows each worker thread's status. If that table
  is not available, the replica error log can be used. The log
  or the
  [`replication_applier_status_by_worker`](performance-schema-replication-applier-status-by-worker-table.md "29.12.11.5 The replication_applier_status_by_worker Table")
  table should also be used to learn more about the failure
  shown by
  [`SHOW
  REPLICA STATUS`](show-replica-status.md "15.7.7.35 SHOW REPLICA STATUS Statement") or the coordinator table.

  SQL error information includes a timestamp showing when the
  most recent SQL (applier) thread error occurred. This
  timestamp uses the format *`YYMMDD
  hh:mm:ss`*, and appears in the
  `Last_SQL_Error_Timestamp` column.

  Issuing [`RESET MASTER`](reset-master.md "15.4.1.2 RESET MASTER Statement") or
  [`RESET
  REPLICA`](reset-replica.md "15.4.2.4 RESET REPLICA Statement") resets the values shown in these columns.

  In MySQL 8.0, all error codes and messages
  displayed in the `Last_SQL_Errno` and
  `Last_SQL_Error` columns correspond to
  error values listed in
  [Server Error Message Reference](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/mysql-errors/8.0/en/server-error-reference.html). This was not
  always true in previous versions. (Bug #11760365, Bug
  #52768)
- `Replicate_Ignore_Server_Ids`

  Any server IDs that have been specified using the
  `IGNORE_SERVER_IDS` option of the
  [`CHANGE REPLICATION SOURCE TO`](change-replication-source-to.md "15.4.2.3 CHANGE REPLICATION SOURCE TO Statement")
  | [`CHANGE MASTER TO`](change-master-to.md "15.4.2.1 CHANGE MASTER TO Statement") statement,
  so that the replica ignores events from these servers. This
  option is used in a circular or other multi-source
  replication setup when one of the servers is removed. If any
  server IDs have been set in this way, a comma-delimited list
  of one or more numbers is shown. If no server IDs have been
  set, the field is blank.

  Note

  The `Ignored_server_ids` value in the
  `slave_master_info` table also shows the
  server IDs to be ignored, but as a space-delimited list,
  preceded by the total number of server IDs to be ignored.
  For example, if a [`CHANGE REPLICATION
  SOURCE TO`](change-replication-source-to.md "15.4.2.3 CHANGE REPLICATION SOURCE TO Statement") | [`CHANGE MASTER
  TO`](change-master-to.md "15.4.2.1 CHANGE MASTER TO Statement") statement containing the
  `IGNORE_SERVER_IDS = (2,6,9)` option has
  been issued to tell a replica to ignore sources having the
  server ID 2, 6, or 9, that information appears as shown
  here:

  ```none
  	Replicate_Ignore_Server_Ids: 2, 6, 9
  ```

  ```none
  	Ignored_server_ids: 3, 2, 6, 9
  ```

  `Replicate_Ignore_Server_Ids` filtering is
  performed by the I/O (receiver) thread, rather than by the
  SQL (applier) thread, which means that events which are
  filtered out are not written to the relay log. This differs
  from the filtering actions taken by server options such
  [`--replicate-do-table`](replication-options-replica.md#option_mysqld_replicate-do-table), which
  apply to the applier thread.

  Note

  From MySQL 8.0, a deprecation warning is issued if
  `SET GTID_MODE=ON` is issued when any
  channel has existing server IDs set with
  `IGNORE_SERVER_IDS`. Before starting
  GTID-based replication, use
  [`SHOW
  REPLICA STATUS`](show-replica-status.md "15.7.7.35 SHOW REPLICA STATUS Statement") to check for and clear all
  ignored server ID lists on the servers involved. You can
  clear a list by issuing a [`CHANGE
  REPLICATION SOURCE TO`](change-replication-source-to.md "15.4.2.3 CHANGE REPLICATION SOURCE TO Statement") |
  [`CHANGE MASTER TO`](change-master-to.md "15.4.2.1 CHANGE MASTER TO Statement") statement
  containing the `IGNORE_SERVER_IDS` option
  with an empty list.
- `Source_Server_Id`

  The [`server_id`](replication-options.md#sysvar_server_id) value from
  the source.
- `Source_UUID`

  The [`server_uuid`](replication-options.md#sysvar_server_uuid) value from
  the source.
- `Source_Info_File`

  The location of the `master.info` file,
  the use of which is now deprecated. By default from MySQL
  8.0, a table is used instead for the replica's connection
  metadata repository.
- `SQL_Delay`

  The number of seconds that the replica must lag the source.
- `SQL_Remaining_Delay`

  When `Replica_SQL_Running_State` is
  `Waiting until MASTER_DELAY seconds after source
  executed event`, this field contains the number of
  delay seconds remaining. At other times, this field is
  `NULL`.
- `Replica_SQL_Running_State`

  The state of the SQL thread (analogous to
  `Replica_IO_State`). The value is identical
  to the `State` value of the SQL thread as
  displayed by [`SHOW
  PROCESSLIST`](show-processlist.md "15.7.7.29 SHOW PROCESSLIST Statement").
  [Section 10.14.6, “Replication SQL Thread States”](replica-sql-thread-states.md "10.14.6 Replication SQL Thread States"), provides a
  listing of possible states.
- `Source_Retry_Count`

  The number of times the replica can attempt to reconnect to
  the source in the event of a lost connection. This value can
  be set using the `SOURCE_RETRY_COUNT` |
  `MASTER_RETRY_COUNT` option of the
  [`CHANGE REPLICATION SOURCE TO`](change-replication-source-to.md "15.4.2.3 CHANGE REPLICATION SOURCE TO Statement")
  statement (from MySQL 8.0.23) or [`CHANGE
  MASTER TO`](change-master-to.md "15.4.2.1 CHANGE MASTER TO Statement") statement (before MySQL 8.0.23), or the
  older [`--master-retry-count`](replication-options-replica.md#option_mysqld_master-retry-count)
  server option (still supported for backward compatibility).
- `Source_Bind`

  The network interface that the replica is bound to, if any.
  This is set using the `SOURCE_BIND` |
  `MASTER_BIND` option for the
  [`CHANGE REPLICATION SOURCE TO`](change-replication-source-to.md "15.4.2.3 CHANGE REPLICATION SOURCE TO Statement")
  statement (from MySQL 8.0.23) or [`CHANGE
  MASTER TO`](change-master-to.md "15.4.2.1 CHANGE MASTER TO Statement") statement (before MySQL 8.0.23).
- `Last_IO_Error_Timestamp`

  A timestamp in *`YYMMDD hh:mm:ss`*
  format that shows when the most recent I/O error took place.
- `Last_SQL_Error_Timestamp`

  A timestamp in *`YYMMDD hh:mm:ss`*
  format that shows when the most recent SQL error occurred.
- `Retrieved_Gtid_Set`

  The set of global transaction IDs corresponding to all
  transactions received by this replica. Empty if GTIDs are
  not in use. See
  [GTID Sets](replication-gtids-concepts.md#replication-gtids-concepts-gtid-sets "GTID Sets") for
  more information.

  This is the set of all GTIDs that exist or have existed in
  the relay logs. Each GTID is added as soon as the
  `Gtid_log_event` is received. This can
  cause partially transmitted transactions to have their GTIDs
  included in the set.

  When all relay logs are lost due to executing
  [`RESET
  REPLICA`](reset-replica.md "15.4.2.4 RESET REPLICA Statement") or [`CHANGE REPLICATION
  SOURCE TO`](change-replication-source-to.md "15.4.2.3 CHANGE REPLICATION SOURCE TO Statement") | [`CHANGE MASTER
  TO`](change-master-to.md "15.4.2.1 CHANGE MASTER TO Statement"), or due to the effects of the
  [`--relay-log-recovery`](replication-options-replica.md#sysvar_relay_log_recovery) option,
  the set is cleared. When
  [`relay_log_purge = 1`](replication-options-replica.md#sysvar_relay_log_purge), the
  newest relay log is always kept, and the set is not cleared.
- `Executed_Gtid_Set`

  The set of global transaction IDs written in the binary log.
  This is the same as the value for the global
  [`gtid_executed`](replication-options-gtids.md#sysvar_gtid_executed) system
  variable on this server, as well as the value for
  `Executed_Gtid_Set` in the output of
  [`SHOW MASTER STATUS`](show-master-status.md "15.7.7.23 SHOW MASTER STATUS Statement") on this
  server. Empty if GTIDs are not in use. See
  [GTID Sets](replication-gtids-concepts.md#replication-gtids-concepts-gtid-sets "GTID Sets") for
  more information.
- `Auto_Position`

  1 if GTID auto-positioning is in use for the channel,
  otherwise 0.
- `Replicate_Rewrite_DB`

  The `Replicate_Rewrite_DB` value displays
  any replication filtering rules that were specified. For
  example, if the following replication filter rule was set:

  ```sql
  CHANGE REPLICATION FILTER REPLICATE_REWRITE_DB=((db1,db2), (db3,db4));
  ```

  the `Replicate_Rewrite_DB` value displays:

  ```none
  Replicate_Rewrite_DB: (db1,db2),(db3,db4)
  ```

  For more information, see
  [Section 15.4.2.2, “CHANGE REPLICATION FILTER Statement”](change-replication-filter.md "15.4.2.2 CHANGE REPLICATION FILTER Statement").
- `Channel_name`

  The replication channel which is being displayed. There is
  always a default replication channel, and more replication
  channels can be added. See
  [Section 19.2.2, “Replication Channels”](replication-channels.md "19.2.2 Replication Channels") for more information.
- `Master_TLS_Version`

  The TLS version used on the source. For TLS version
  information, see
  [Section 8.3.2, “Encrypted Connection TLS Protocols and Ciphers”](encrypted-connection-protocols-ciphers.md "8.3.2 Encrypted Connection TLS Protocols and Ciphers").
- `Source_public_key_path`

  The path name to a file containing a replica-side copy of
  the public key required by the source for RSA key pair-based
  password exchange. The file must be in PEM format. This
  column applies to replicas that authenticate with the
  `sha256_password` or
  `caching_sha2_password` authentication
  plugin.

  If `Source_public_key_path` is given and
  specifies a valid public key file, it takes precedence over
  `Get_source_public_key`.
- `Get_source_public_key`

  Whether to request from the source the public key required
  for RSA key pair-based password exchange. This column
  applies to replicas that authenticate with the
  `caching_sha2_password` authentication
  plugin. For that plugin, the source does not send the public
  key unless requested.

  If `Source_public_key_path` is given and
  specifies a valid public key file, it takes precedence over
  `Get_source_public_key`.
- `Network_Namespace`

  The network namespace name; empty if the connection uses the
  default (global) namespace. For information about network
  namespaces, see [Section 7.1.14, “Network Namespace Support”](network-namespace-support.md "7.1.14 Network Namespace Support").
  This column was added in MySQL 8.0.22.
