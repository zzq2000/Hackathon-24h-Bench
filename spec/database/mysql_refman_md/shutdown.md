#### 15.7.8.9 SHUTDOWN Statement

```sql
SHUTDOWN
```

This statement stops the MySQL server. It requires the
[`SHUTDOWN`](privileges-provided.md#priv_shutdown) privilege.

[`SHUTDOWN`](shutdown.md "15.7.8.9 SHUTDOWN Statement") provides an SQL-level
interface to the same functionality available using the
[**mysqladmin shutdown**](mysqladmin.md "6.5.2 mysqladmin — A MySQL Server Administration Program") command or the
[`mysql_shutdown()`](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/c-api/8.0/en/mysql-shutdown.html) C API function.
A successful [`SHUTDOWN`](shutdown.md "15.7.8.9 SHUTDOWN Statement") sequence
consists of checking the privileges, validating the arguments,
and sending an OK packet to the client. Then the server is shut
down.

The
[`Com_shutdown`](server-status-variables.md#statvar_Com_xxx)
status variable tracks the number of
[`SHUTDOWN`](shutdown.md "15.7.8.9 SHUTDOWN Statement") statements. Because
status variables are initialized for each server startup and do
not persist across restarts, `Com_shutdown`
normally has a value of zero, but can be nonzero if
[`SHUTDOWN`](shutdown.md "15.7.8.9 SHUTDOWN Statement") statements were executed
but failed.

Another way to stop the server is to send it a
`SIGTERM` signal, which can be done by
`root` or the account that owns the server
process. `SIGTERM` enables server shutdown to
be performed without having to connect to the server. See
[Section 6.10, “Unix Signal Handling in MySQL”](unix-signal-response.md "6.10 Unix Signal Handling in MySQL").
