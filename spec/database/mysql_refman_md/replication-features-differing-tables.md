#### 19.5.1.9 Replication with Differing Table Definitions on Source and Replica

Source and target tables for replication do not have to be
identical. A table on the source can have more or fewer columns
than the replica's copy of the table. In addition, corresponding
table columns on the source and the replica can use different
data types, subject to certain conditions.

Note

Replication between tables which are partitioned differently
from one another is not supported. See
[Section 19.5.1.24, “Replication and Partitioning”](replication-features-partitioning.md "19.5.1.24 Replication and Partitioning").

In all cases where the source and target tables do not have
identical definitions, the database and table names must be the
same on both the source and the replica. Additional conditions
are discussed, with examples, in the following two sections.

##### 19.5.1.9.1 Replication with More Columns on Source or Replica

You can replicate a table from the source to the replica such
that the source and replica copies of the table have differing
numbers of columns, subject to the following conditions:

- Columns common to both versions of the table must be
  defined in the same order on the source and the replica.
  (This is true even if both tables have the same number of
  columns.)
- Columns common to both versions of the table must be
  defined before any additional columns.

  This means that executing an [`ALTER
  TABLE`](alter-table.md "15.1.9 ALTER TABLE Statement") statement on the replica where a new
  column is inserted into the table within the range of
  columns common to both tables causes replication to fail,
  as shown in the following example:

  Suppose that a table `t`, existing on the
  source and the replica, is defined by the following
  [`CREATE TABLE`](create-table.md "15.1.20 CREATE TABLE Statement") statement:

  ```sql
  CREATE TABLE t (
      c1 INT,
      c2 INT,
      c3 INT
  );
  ```

  Suppose that the [`ALTER
  TABLE`](alter-table.md "15.1.9 ALTER TABLE Statement") statement shown here is executed on the
  replica:

  ```sql
  ALTER TABLE t ADD COLUMN cnew1 INT AFTER c3;
  ```

  The previous [`ALTER TABLE`](alter-table.md "15.1.9 ALTER TABLE Statement") is
  permitted on the replica because the columns
  `c1`, `c2`, and
  `c3` that are common to both versions of
  table `t` remain grouped together in both
  versions of the table, before any columns that differ.

  However, the following [`ALTER
  TABLE`](alter-table.md "15.1.9 ALTER TABLE Statement") statement cannot be executed on the
  replica without causing replication to break:

  ```sql
  ALTER TABLE t ADD COLUMN cnew2 INT AFTER c2;
  ```

  Replication fails after execution on the replica of the
  [`ALTER TABLE`](alter-table.md "15.1.9 ALTER TABLE Statement") statement just
  shown, because the new column `cnew2`
  comes between columns common to both versions of
  `t`.
- Each “extra” column in the version of the
  table having more columns must have a default value.

  A column's default value is determined by a number of
  factors, including its type, whether it is defined with a
  `DEFAULT` option, whether it is declared
  as `NULL`, and the server SQL mode in
  effect at the time of its creation; for more information,
  see [Section 13.6, “Data Type Default Values”](data-type-defaults.md "13.6 Data Type Default Values")).

In addition, when the replica's copy of the table has more
columns than the source's copy, each column common to the
tables must use the same data type in both tables.

**Examples.**
The following examples illustrate some valid and invalid
table definitions:

**More columns on the source.**
The following table definitions are valid and replicate
correctly:

```sql
source> CREATE TABLE t1 (c1 INT, c2 INT, c3 INT);
replica>  CREATE TABLE t1 (c1 INT, c2 INT);
```

The following table definitions would raise an error because
the definitions of the columns common to both versions of the
table are in a different order on the replica than they are on
the source:

```sql
source> CREATE TABLE t1 (c1 INT, c2 INT, c3 INT);
replica>  CREATE TABLE t1 (c2 INT, c1 INT);
```

The following table definitions would also raise an error
because the definition of the extra column on the source
appears before the definitions of the columns common to both
versions of the table:

```sql
source> CREATE TABLE t1 (c3 INT, c1 INT, c2 INT);
replica>  CREATE TABLE t1 (c1 INT, c2 INT);
```

**More columns on the replica.**
The following table definitions are valid and replicate
correctly:

```sql
source> CREATE TABLE t1 (c1 INT, c2 INT);
replica>  CREATE TABLE t1 (c1 INT, c2 INT, c3 INT);
```

The following definitions raise an error because the columns
common to both versions of the table are not defined in the
same order on both the source and the replica:

```sql
source> CREATE TABLE t1 (c1 INT, c2 INT);
replica>  CREATE TABLE t1 (c2 INT, c1 INT, c3 INT);
```

The following table definitions also raise an error because
the definition for the extra column in the replica's version
of the table appears before the definitions for the columns
which are common to both versions of the table:

```sql
source> CREATE TABLE t1 (c1 INT, c2 INT);
replica>  CREATE TABLE t1 (c3 INT, c1 INT, c2 INT);
```

The following table definitions fail because the replica's
version of the table has additional columns compared to the
source's version, and the two versions of the table use
different data types for the common column
`c2`:

```sql
source> CREATE TABLE t1 (c1 INT, c2 BIGINT);
replica>  CREATE TABLE t1 (c1 INT, c2 INT, c3 INT);
```

##### 19.5.1.9.2 Replication of Columns Having Different Data Types

Corresponding columns on the source's and the
replica's copies of the same table ideally should have
the same data type. However, this is not always strictly
enforced, as long as certain conditions are met.

It is usually possible to replicate from a column of a given
data type to another column of the same type and same size or
width, where applicable, or larger. For example, you can
replicate from a `CHAR(10)` column to another
`CHAR(10)`, or from a
`CHAR(10)` column to a
`CHAR(25)` column without any problems. In
certain cases, it also possible to replicate from a column
having one data type (on the source) to a column having a
different data type (on the replica); when the data type of
the source's version of the column is promoted to a type
that is the same size or larger on the replica, this is known
as attribute promotion.

Attribute promotion can be used with both statement-based and
row-based replication, and is not dependent on the storage
engine used by either the source or the replica. However, the
choice of logging format does have an effect on the type
conversions that are permitted; the particulars are discussed
later in this section.

Important

Whether you use statement-based or row-based replication,
the replica's copy of the table cannot contain more
columns than the source's copy if you wish to employ
attribute promotion.

**Statement-based replication.**
When using statement-based replication, a simple rule of
thumb to follow is, “If the statement run on the
source would also execute successfully on the replica, it
should also replicate successfully”. In other words,
if the statement uses a value that is compatible with the
type of a given column on the replica, the statement can be
replicated. For example, you can insert any value that fits
in a `TINYINT` column into a
`BIGINT` column as well; it follows that,
even if you change the type of a `TINYINT`
column in the replica's copy of a table to
`BIGINT`, any insert into that column on
the source that succeeds should also succeed on the replica,
since it is impossible to have a legal
`TINYINT` value that is large enough to
exceed a `BIGINT` column.

**Row-based replication: attribute promotion and demotion.**
Row-based replication supports attribute promotion and
demotion between smaller data types and larger types. It is
also possible to specify whether or not to permit lossy
(truncated) or non-lossy conversions of demoted column
values, as explained later in this section.

**Lossy and non-lossy conversions.**
In the event that the target type cannot represent the value
being inserted, a decision must be made on how to handle the
conversion. If we permit the conversion but truncate (or
otherwise modify) the source value to achieve a
“fit” in the target column, we make what is
known as a lossy
conversion. A conversion which does not require
truncation or similar modifications to fit the source column
value in the target column is a
non-lossy conversion.

**Type conversion modes.**
The global value of the system variable
`replica_type_conversions` (from MySQL
8.0.26) or `slave_type_conversions` (before
MySQL 8.0.26) controls the type conversion mode used on the
replica. This variable takes a set of values from the
following list, which describes the effects of each mode on
the replica's type-conversion behavior:

ALL\_LOSSY
:   In this mode, type conversions that would mean loss of
    information are permitted.

    This does not imply that non-lossy conversions are
    permitted, merely that only cases requiring either lossy
    conversions or no conversion at all are permitted; for
    example, enabling *only* this mode
    permits an `INT` column to be converted
    to `TINYINT` (a lossy conversion), but
    not a `TINYINT` column to an
    `INT` column (non-lossy). Attempting
    the latter conversion in this case would cause
    replication to stop with an error on the replica.

ALL\_NON\_LOSSY
:   This mode permits conversions that do not require
    truncation or other special handling of the source
    value; that is, it permits conversions where the target
    type has a wider range than the source type.

    Setting this mode has no bearing on whether lossy
    conversions are permitted; this is controlled with the
    `ALL_LOSSY` mode. If only
    `ALL_NON_LOSSY` is set, but not
    `ALL_LOSSY`, then attempting a
    conversion that would result in the loss of data (such
    as `INT` to `TINYINT`,
    or `CHAR(25)` to
    `VARCHAR(20)`) causes the replica to
    stop with an error.

ALL\_LOSSY,ALL\_NON\_LOSSY
:   When this mode is set, all supported type conversions
    are permitted, whether or not they are lossy
    conversions.

ALL\_SIGNED
:   Treat promoted integer types as signed values (the
    default behavior).

ALL\_UNSIGNED
:   Treat promoted integer types as unsigned values.

ALL\_SIGNED,ALL\_UNSIGNED
:   Treat promoted integer types as signed if possible,
    otherwise as unsigned.

[*empty*]
:   When `replica_type_conversions` or
    `slave_type_conversions` is not set, no
    attribute promotion or demotion is permitted; this means
    that all columns in the source and target tables must be
    of the same types.

    This mode is the default.

When an integer type is promoted, its signedness is not
preserved. By default, the replica treats all such values as
signed. You can control this behavior using
`ALL_SIGNED`,
`ALL_UNSIGNED`, or both.
`ALL_SIGNED` tells the replica to treat all
promoted integer types as signed;
`ALL_UNSIGNED` instructs it to treat these as
unsigned. Specifying both causes the replica to treat the
value as signed if possible, otherwise to treat it as
unsigned; the order in which they are listed is not
significant. Neither `ALL_SIGNED` nor
`ALL_UNSIGNED` has any effect if at least one
of `ALL_LOSSY` or
`ALL_NONLOSSY` is not also used.

Changing the type conversion mode requires restarting the
replica with the new
`replica_type_conversions` or
`slave_type_conversions` setting.

**Supported conversions.**
Supported conversions between different but similar data
types are shown in the following list:

- Between any of the integer types
  [`TINYINT`](integer-types.md "13.1.2 Integer Types (Exact Value) - INTEGER, INT, SMALLINT, TINYINT, MEDIUMINT, BIGINT"),
  [`SMALLINT`](integer-types.md "13.1.2 Integer Types (Exact Value) - INTEGER, INT, SMALLINT, TINYINT, MEDIUMINT, BIGINT"),
  [`MEDIUMINT`](integer-types.md "13.1.2 Integer Types (Exact Value) - INTEGER, INT, SMALLINT, TINYINT, MEDIUMINT, BIGINT"),
  [`INT`](integer-types.md "13.1.2 Integer Types (Exact Value) - INTEGER, INT, SMALLINT, TINYINT, MEDIUMINT, BIGINT"), and
  [`BIGINT`](integer-types.md "13.1.2 Integer Types (Exact Value) - INTEGER, INT, SMALLINT, TINYINT, MEDIUMINT, BIGINT").

  This includes conversions between the signed and unsigned
  versions of these types.

  Lossy conversions are made by truncating the source value
  to the maximum (or minimum) permitted by the target
  column. For ensuring non-lossy conversions when going from
  unsigned to signed types, the target column must be large
  enough to accommodate the range of values in the source
  column. For example, you can demote `TINYINT
  UNSIGNED` non-lossily to
  `SMALLINT`, but not to
  `TINYINT`.
- Between any of the decimal types
  [`DECIMAL`](fixed-point-types.md "13.1.3 Fixed-Point Types (Exact Value) - DECIMAL, NUMERIC"),
  [`FLOAT`](floating-point-types.md "13.1.4 Floating-Point Types (Approximate Value) - FLOAT, DOUBLE"),
  [`DOUBLE`](floating-point-types.md "13.1.4 Floating-Point Types (Approximate Value) - FLOAT, DOUBLE"), and
  [`NUMERIC`](fixed-point-types.md "13.1.3 Fixed-Point Types (Exact Value) - DECIMAL, NUMERIC").

  `FLOAT` to `DOUBLE` is a
  non-lossy conversion; `DOUBLE` to
  `FLOAT` can only be handled lossily. A
  conversion from
  `DECIMAL(M,D)`
  to
  `DECIMAL(M',D')`
  where `D' >=
  D` and
  `(M'-D')
  >=
  (M-D`)
  is non-lossy; for any case where
  `M' <
  M`,
  `D' <
  D`, or both, only a
  lossy conversion can be made.

  For any of the decimal types, if a value to be stored
  cannot be fit in the target type, the value is rounded
  down according to the rounding rules defined for the
  server elsewhere in the documentation. See
  [Section 14.24.4, “Rounding Behavior”](precision-math-rounding.md "14.24.4 Rounding Behavior"), for information
  about how this is done for decimal types.
- Between any of the string types
  [`CHAR`](char.md "13.3.2 The CHAR and VARCHAR Types"),
  [`VARCHAR`](char.md "13.3.2 The CHAR and VARCHAR Types"), and
  [`TEXT`](blob.md "13.3.4 The BLOB and TEXT Types"), including conversions
  between different widths.

  Conversion of a `CHAR`,
  `VARCHAR`, or `TEXT` to
  a `CHAR`, `VARCHAR`, or
  `TEXT` column the same size or larger is
  never lossy. Lossy conversion is handled by inserting only
  the first *`N`* characters of the
  string on the replica, where *`N`*
  is the width of the target column.

  Important

  Replication between columns using different character
  sets is not supported.
- Between any of the binary data types
  [`BINARY`](binary-varbinary.md "13.3.3 The BINARY and VARBINARY Types"),
  [`VARBINARY`](binary-varbinary.md "13.3.3 The BINARY and VARBINARY Types"), and
  [`BLOB`](blob.md "13.3.4 The BLOB and TEXT Types"), including conversions
  between different widths.

  Conversion of a `BINARY`,
  `VARBINARY`, or `BLOB`
  to a `BINARY`,
  `VARBINARY`, or `BLOB`
  column the same size or larger is never lossy. Lossy
  conversion is handled by inserting only the first
  *`N`* bytes of the string on the
  replica, where *`N`* is the width
  of the target column.
- Between any 2 [`BIT`](bit-type.md "13.1.5 Bit-Value Type - BIT") columns
  of any 2 sizes.

  When inserting a value from a
  `BIT(M)`
  column into a
  `BIT(M')`
  column, where `M' >
  M`, the most
  significant bits of the
  `BIT(M')`
  columns are cleared (set to zero) and the
  *`M`* bits of the
  `BIT(M)` value
  are set as the least significant bits of the
  `BIT(M')`
  column.

  When inserting a value from a source
  `BIT(M)`
  column into a target
  `BIT(M')`
  column, where `M' <
  M`, the maximum
  possible value for the
  `BIT(M')`
  column is assigned; in other words, an
  “all-set” value is assigned to the target
  column.

Conversions between types not in the previous list are not
permitted.
