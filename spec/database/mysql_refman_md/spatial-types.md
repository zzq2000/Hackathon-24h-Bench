The [Open Geospatial
Consortium](http://www.opengeospatial.org) (OGC) is an international consortium of more
than 250 companies, agencies, and universities participating in
the development of publicly available conceptual solutions that
can be useful with all kinds of applications that manage spatial
data.

The Open Geospatial Consortium publishes the
*OpenGIS® Implementation Standard for Geographic
information - Simple feature access - Part 2: SQL
option*, a document that proposes several conceptual
ways for extending an SQL RDBMS to support spatial data. This
specification is available from the OGC website at
<http://www.opengeospatial.org/standards/sfs>.

Following the OGC specification, MySQL implements spatial
extensions as a subset of the **SQL with
Geometry Types** environment. This term refers to an SQL
environment that has been extended with a set of geometry types. A
geometry-valued SQL column is implemented as a column that has a
geometry type. The specification describes a set of SQL geometry
types, as well as functions on those types to create and analyze
geometry values.

MySQL spatial extensions enable the generation, storage, and
analysis of geographic features:

- Data types for representing spatial values
- Functions for manipulating spatial values
- Spatial indexing for improved access times to spatial columns

The spatial data types and functions are available for
[`MyISAM`](myisam-storage-engine.md "18.2 The MyISAM Storage Engine"),
[`InnoDB`](innodb-storage-engine.md "Chapter 17 The InnoDB Storage Engine"),
[`NDB`](mysql-cluster.md "Chapter 25 MySQL NDB Cluster 8.0"), and
[`ARCHIVE`](archive-storage-engine.md "18.5 The ARCHIVE Storage Engine") tables. For indexing spatial
columns, `MyISAM` and `InnoDB`
support both `SPATIAL` and
non-`SPATIAL` indexes. The other storage engines
support non-`SPATIAL` indexes, as described in
[Section 15.1.15, “CREATE INDEX Statement”](create-index.md "15.1.15 CREATE INDEX Statement").

A **geographic feature** is anything
in the world that has a location. A feature can be:

- An entity. For example, a mountain, a pond, a city.
- A space. For example, town district, the tropics.
- A definable location. For example, a crossroad, as a
  particular place where two streets intersect.

Some documents use the term **geospatial
feature** to refer to geographic features.

**Geometry** is another word that
denotes a geographic feature. Originally the word
**geometry** meant measurement of the
earth. Another meaning comes from cartography, referring to the
geometric features that cartographers use to map the world.

The discussion here considers these terms synonymous:
**geographic feature**,
**geospatial feature**,
**feature**, or
**geometry**. The term most commonly
used is **geometry**, defined as
*a point or an aggregate of points representing anything
in the world that has a location*.

The following material covers these topics:

- The spatial data types implemented in MySQL model
- The basis of the spatial extensions in the OpenGIS geometry
  model
- Data formats for representing spatial data
- How to use spatial data in MySQL
- Use of indexing for spatial data
- MySQL differences from the OpenGIS specification

[Section 14.16, “Spatial Analysis Functions”](spatial-analysis-functions.md "14.16 Spatial Analysis Functions").

### Additional Resources

These standards are important for the MySQL implementation of
spatial operations:

- The [Open Geospatial
  Consortium](http://www.opengeospatial.org) publishes the *OpenGIS®
  Implementation Standard for Geographic
  information*, a document that proposes several
  conceptual ways for extending an SQL RDBMS to support spatial
  data. See in particular Simple Feature Access - Part 1: Common
  Architecture, and Simple Feature Access - Part 2: SQL Option.
  The Open Geospatial Consortium (OGC) maintains a website at
  <http://www.opengeospatial.org/>. The
  specification is available there at
  <http://www.opengeospatial.org/standards/sfs>. It
  contains additional information relevant to the material here.
- The grammar for
  [spatial reference
  system](spatial-reference-systems.md "13.4.5 Spatial Reference System Support") (SRS) definitions is based on the grammar
  defined in *OpenGIS Implementation Specification:
  Coordinate Transformation Services*, Revision 1.00,
  OGC 01-009, January 12, 2001, Section 7.2. This specification
  is available at
  <http://www.opengeospatial.org/standards/ct>. For
  differences from that specification in SRS definitions as
  implemented in MySQL, see
  [Section 15.1.19, “CREATE SPATIAL REFERENCE SYSTEM Statement”](create-spatial-reference-system.md "15.1.19 CREATE SPATIAL REFERENCE SYSTEM Statement").
