#### 8.4.5.7 Audit Log Filtering

Note

For audit log filtering to work as described here, the audit
log plugin *and the accompanying audit tables and
functions* must be installed. If the plugin is
installed without the accompanying audit tables and functions
needed for rule-based filtering, the plugin operates in legacy
filtering mode, described in
[Section 8.4.5.10, “Legacy Mode Audit Log Filtering”](audit-log-legacy-filtering.md "8.4.5.10 Legacy Mode Audit Log Filtering"). Legacy mode
(deprecated in MySQL 8.0.34) is filtering behavior as it was
prior to MySQL 5.7.13; that is, before the introduction of
rule-based filtering.

##### Properties of Audit Log Filtering

The audit log plugin has the capability of controlling logging
of audited events by filtering them:

- Audited events can be filtered using these
  characteristics:

  - User account
  - Audit event class
  - Audit event subclass
  - Audit event fields such as those that indicate
    operation status or SQL statement executed
- Audit filtering is rule based:

  - A filter definition creates a set of auditing rules.
    Definitions can be configured to include or exclude
    events for logging based on the characteristics just
    described.
  - Filter rules have the capability of blocking
    (aborting) execution of qualifying events, in addition
    to existing capabilities for event logging.
  - Multiple filters can be defined, and any given filter
    can be assigned to any number of user accounts.
  - It is possible to define a default filter to use with
    any user account that has no explicitly assigned
    filter.

  Audit log filtering is used to implement component
  services from MySQL 8.0.30. To get the optional query
  statistics available from that release, you set them up as
  a filter using the service component, which implements the
  services that write the statistics to the audit log. For
  instructions to set this filter up, see
  [Adding Query Statistics for Outlier Detection](audit-log-logging-configuration.md#audit-log-query-statistics "Adding Query Statistics for Outlier Detection").

  For information about writing filtering rules, see
  [Section 8.4.5.8, “Writing Audit Log Filter Definitions”](audit-log-filter-definitions.md "8.4.5.8 Writing Audit Log Filter Definitions").
- Audit log filters can be defined and modified using an SQL
  interface based on function calls. By default, audit log
  filter definitions are stored in the
  `mysql` system database, and you can
  display audit filters by querying the
  `mysql.audit_log_filter` table. It is
  possible to use a different database for this purpose, in
  which case you should query the
  `database_name.audit_log_filter`
  table instead. See
  [Section 8.4.5.2, “Installing or Uninstalling MySQL Enterprise Audit”](audit-log-installation.md "8.4.5.2 Installing or Uninstalling MySQL Enterprise Audit"), for more
  information.
- Within a given session, the value of the read-only
  [`audit_log_filter_id`](audit-log-reference.md#sysvar_audit_log_filter_id)
  system variable indicates whether a filter is assigned to
  the session.

Note

By default, rule-based audit log filtering logs no auditable
events for any users. To log all auditable events for all
users, use the following statements, which create a simple
filter to enable logging and assign it to the default
account:

```sql
SELECT audit_log_filter_set_filter('log_all', '{ "filter": { "log": true } }');
SELECT audit_log_filter_set_user('%', 'log_all');
```

The filter assigned to `%` is used for
connections from any account that has no explicitly assigned
filter (which initially is true for all accounts).

As previously mentioned, the SQL interface for audit filtering
control is function based. The following list briefly
summarizes these functions:

- [`audit_log_filter_set_filter()`](audit-log-reference.md#function_audit-log-filter-set-filter):
  Define a filter.
- [`audit_log_filter_remove_filter()`](audit-log-reference.md#function_audit-log-filter-remove-filter):
  Remove a filter.
- [`audit_log_filter_set_user()`](audit-log-reference.md#function_audit-log-filter-set-user):
  Start filtering a user account.
- [`audit_log_filter_remove_user()`](audit-log-reference.md#function_audit-log-filter-remove-user):
  Stop filtering a user account.
- [`audit_log_filter_flush()`](audit-log-reference.md#function_audit-log-filter-flush):
  Flush manual changes to the filter tables to affect
  ongoing filtering.

For usage examples and complete details about the filtering
functions, see
[Using Audit Log Filtering Functions](audit-log-filtering.md#audit-log-filtering-function-usage "Using Audit Log Filtering Functions"), and
[Audit Log Functions](audit-log-reference.md#audit-log-routines "Audit Log Functions").

##### Constraints on Audit Log Filtering Functions

Audit log filtering functions are subject to these
constraints:

- To use any filtering function, the
  `audit_log` plugin must be enabled or an
  error occurs. In addition, the audit tables must exist or
  an error occurs. To install the
  `audit_log` plugin and its accompanying
  functions and tables, see
  [Section 8.4.5.2, “Installing or Uninstalling MySQL Enterprise Audit”](audit-log-installation.md "8.4.5.2 Installing or Uninstalling MySQL Enterprise Audit").
- To use any filtering function, a user must possess the
  [`AUDIT_ADMIN`](privileges-provided.md#priv_audit-admin)
  [`SUPER`](privileges-provided.md#priv_super) privilege or an error
  occurs. To grant one of these privileges to a user
  account, use this statement:

  ```sql
  GRANT privilege ON *.* TO user;
  ```

  Alternatively, should you prefer to avoid granting the
  [`AUDIT_ADMIN`](privileges-provided.md#priv_audit-admin) or
  [`SUPER`](privileges-provided.md#priv_super) privilege while still
  permitting users to access specific filtering functions,
  “wrapper” stored programs can be defined.
  This technique is described in the context of keyring
  functions in [Using General-Purpose Keyring Functions](keyring-functions-general-purpose.md#keyring-function-usage "Using General-Purpose Keyring Functions"); it
  can be adapted for use with filtering functions.
- The `audit_log` plugin operates in legacy
  mode if it is installed but the accompanying audit tables
  and functions are not created. The plugin writes these
  messages to the error log at server startup:

  ```none
  [Warning] Plugin audit_log reported: 'Failed to open the audit log filter tables.'
  [Warning] Plugin audit_log reported: 'Audit Log plugin supports a filtering,
  which has not been installed yet. Audit Log plugin will run in the legacy
  mode, which will be disabled in the next release.'
  ```

  In legacy mode, which is deprecated as of MySQL 8.0.34,
  filtering can be done based only on event account or
  status. For details, see
  [Section 8.4.5.10, “Legacy Mode Audit Log Filtering”](audit-log-legacy-filtering.md "8.4.5.10 Legacy Mode Audit Log Filtering").
- It is theoretically possible for a user with sufficient
  permissions to mistakenly create an “abort”
  item in the audit log filter that prevents themselves and
  other administrators from accessing the system. From MySQL
  8.0.28, the
  [`AUDIT_ABORT_EXEMPT`](privileges-provided.md#priv_audit-abort-exempt)
  privilege is available to permit a user account’s
  queries to always be executed even if an
  “abort” item would block them. Accounts with
  this privilege can therefore be used to regain access to a
  system following an audit misconfiguration. The query is
  still logged in the audit log, but instead of being
  rejected, it is permitted due to the privilege.

  Accounts created in MySQL 8.0.28 or later with the
  [`SYSTEM_USER`](privileges-provided.md#priv_system-user) privilege have
  the [`AUDIT_ABORT_EXEMPT`](privileges-provided.md#priv_audit-abort-exempt)
  privilege assigned automatically when they are created.
  The [`AUDIT_ABORT_EXEMPT`](privileges-provided.md#priv_audit-abort-exempt)
  privilege is also assigned to existing accounts with the
  [`SYSTEM_USER`](privileges-provided.md#priv_system-user)
  privilege when you carry out an upgrade procedure with
  MySQL 8.0.28 or later, if no existing accounts have that
  privilege assigned.

##### Using Audit Log Filtering Functions

Before using the audit log functions, install them according
to the instructions provided in
[Section 8.4.5.2, “Installing or Uninstalling MySQL Enterprise Audit”](audit-log-installation.md "8.4.5.2 Installing or Uninstalling MySQL Enterprise Audit"). The
[`AUDIT_ADMIN`](privileges-provided.md#priv_audit-admin) or
[`SUPER`](privileges-provided.md#priv_super) privilege is required to
use any of these functions.

The audit log filtering functions enable filtering control by
providing an interface to create, modify, and remove filter
definitions and assign filters to user accounts.

Filter definitions are [`JSON`](json.md "13.5 The JSON Data Type")
values. For information about using
[`JSON`](json.md "13.5 The JSON Data Type") data in MySQL, see
[Section 13.5, “The JSON Data Type”](json.md "13.5 The JSON Data Type"). This section shows some simple filter
definitions. For more information about filter definitions,
see [Section 8.4.5.8, “Writing Audit Log Filter Definitions”](audit-log-filter-definitions.md "8.4.5.8 Writing Audit Log Filter Definitions").

When a connection arrives, the audit log plugin determines
which filter to use for the new session by searching for the
user account name in the current filter assignments:

- If a filter is assigned to the user, the audit log uses
  that filter.
- Otherwise, if no user-specific filter assignment exists,
  but there is a filter assigned to the default account
  (`%`), the audit log uses the default
  filter.
- Otherwise, the audit log selects no audit events from the
  session for processing.

If a change-user operation occurs during a session (see
[mysql\_change\_user()](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/c-api/8.0/en/mysql-change-user.html)), filter assignment for
the session is updated using the same rules but for the new
user.

By default, no accounts have a filter assigned, so no
processing of auditable events occurs for any account.

Suppose that you want to change the default to be to log only
connection-related activity (for example, to see connect,
change-user, and disconnect events, but not the SQL statements
users execute while connected). To achieve this, define a
filter (shown here named `log_conn_events`)
that enables logging only of events in the
`connection` class, and assign that filter to
the default account, represented by the `%`
account name:

```sql
SET @f = '{ "filter": { "class": { "name": "connection" } } }';
SELECT audit_log_filter_set_filter('log_conn_events', @f);
SELECT audit_log_filter_set_user('%', 'log_conn_events');
```

Now the audit log uses this default account filter for
connections from any account that has no explicitly defined
filter.

To assign a filter explicitly to a particular user account or
accounts, define the filter, then assign it to the relevant
accounts:

```sql
SELECT audit_log_filter_set_filter('log_all', '{ "filter": { "log": true } }');
SELECT audit_log_filter_set_user('user1@localhost', 'log_all');
SELECT audit_log_filter_set_user('user2@localhost', 'log_all');
```

Now full logging is enabled for
`user1@localhost` and
`user2@localhost`. Connections from other
accounts continue to be filtered using the default account
filter.

To disassociate a user account from its current filter, either
unassign the filter or assign a different filter:

- To unassign the filter from the user account:

  ```sql
  SELECT audit_log_filter_remove_user('user1@localhost');
  ```

  Filtering of current sessions for the account remains
  unaffected. Subsequent connections from the account are
  filtered using the default account filter if there is one,
  and are not logged otherwise.
- To assign a different filter to the user account:

  ```sql
  SELECT audit_log_filter_set_filter('log_nothing', '{ "filter": { "log": false } }');
  SELECT audit_log_filter_set_user('user1@localhost', 'log_nothing');
  ```

  Filtering of current sessions for the account remains
  unaffected. Subsequent connections from the account are
  filtered using the new filter. For the filter shown here,
  that means no logging for new connections from
  `user1@localhost`.

For audit log filtering, user name and host name comparisons
are case-sensitive. This differs from comparisons for
privilege checking, for which host name comparisons are not
case-sensitive.

To remove a filter, do this:

```sql
SELECT audit_log_filter_remove_filter('log_nothing');
```

Removing a filter also unassigns it from any users to whom it
is assigned, including any current sessions for those users.

The filtering functions just described affect audit filtering
immediately and update the audit log tables in the
`mysql` system database that store filters
and user accounts (see [Audit Log Tables](audit-log-reference.md#audit-log-tables "Audit Log Tables")). It
is also possible to modify the audit log tables directly using
statements such as [`INSERT`](insert.md "15.2.7 INSERT Statement"),
[`UPDATE`](update.md "15.2.17 UPDATE Statement"), and
[`DELETE`](delete.md "15.2.2 DELETE Statement"), but such changes do not
affect filtering immediately. To flush your changes and make
them operational, call
[`audit_log_filter_flush()`](audit-log-reference.md#function_audit-log-filter-flush):

```sql
SELECT audit_log_filter_flush();
```

Warning

[`audit_log_filter_flush()`](audit-log-reference.md#function_audit-log-filter-flush)
should be used only after modifying the audit tables
directly, to force reloading all filters. Otherwise, this
function should be avoided. It is, in effect, a simplified
version of unloading and reloading the
`audit_log` plugin with
[`UNINSTALL PLUGIN`](uninstall-plugin.md "15.7.4.6 UNINSTALL PLUGIN Statement") plus
[`INSTALL PLUGIN`](install-plugin.md "15.7.4.4 INSTALL PLUGIN Statement").

[`audit_log_filter_flush()`](audit-log-reference.md#function_audit-log-filter-flush)
affects all current sessions and detaches them from their
previous filters. Current sessions are no longer logged
unless they disconnect and reconnect, or execute a
change-user operation.

To determine whether a filter is assigned to the current
session, check the session value of the read-only
[`audit_log_filter_id`](audit-log-reference.md#sysvar_audit_log_filter_id) system
variable. If the value is 0, no filter is assigned. A nonzero
value indicates the internally maintained ID of the assigned
filter:

```sql
mysql> SELECT @@audit_log_filter_id;
+-----------------------+
| @@audit_log_filter_id |
+-----------------------+
|                     2 |
+-----------------------+
```
