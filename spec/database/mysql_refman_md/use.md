### 15.8.4 USE Statement

```sql
USE db_name
```

The [`USE`](use.md "15.8.4 USE Statement") statement tells MySQL to
use the named database as the default (current) database for
subsequent statements. This statement requires some privilege for
the database or some object within it.

The named database remains the default until the end of the
session or another [`USE`](use.md "15.8.4 USE Statement") statement is
issued:

```sql
USE db1;
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM mytable;   # selects from db1.mytable
USE db2;
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM mytable;   # selects from db2.mytable
```

The database name must be specified on a single line. Newlines in
database names are not supported.

Making a particular database the default by means of the
[`USE`](use.md "15.8.4 USE Statement") statement does not preclude
accessing tables in other databases. The following example
accesses the `author` table from the
`db1` database and the `editor`
table from the `db2` database:

```sql
USE db1;
SELECT author_name,editor_name FROM author,db2.editor
  WHERE author.editor_id = db2.editor.editor_id;
```
