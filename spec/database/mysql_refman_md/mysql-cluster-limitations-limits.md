#### 25.2.7.2 Limits and Differences of NDB Cluster from Standard MySQL Limits

In this section, we list limits found in NDB Cluster that either
differ from limits found in, or that are not found in, standard
MySQL.

**Memory usage and recovery.**
Memory consumed when data is inserted into an
[`NDB`](mysql-cluster.md "Chapter 25 MySQL NDB Cluster 8.0") table is not automatically
recovered when deleted, as it is with other storage engines.
Instead, the following rules hold true:

- A [`DELETE`](delete.md "15.2.2 DELETE Statement") statement on an
  [`NDB`](mysql-cluster.md "Chapter 25 MySQL NDB Cluster 8.0") table makes the memory
  formerly used by the deleted rows available for re-use by
  inserts on the same table only. However, this memory can be
  made available for general re-use by performing
  [`OPTIMIZE TABLE`](optimize-table.md "15.7.3.4 OPTIMIZE TABLE Statement").

  A rolling restart of the cluster also frees any memory used
  by deleted rows. See
  [Section 25.6.5, “Performing a Rolling Restart of an NDB Cluster”](mysql-cluster-rolling-restart.md "25.6.5 Performing a Rolling Restart of an NDB Cluster").
- A [`DROP TABLE`](drop-table.md "15.1.32 DROP TABLE Statement") or
  [`TRUNCATE TABLE`](truncate-table.md "15.1.37 TRUNCATE TABLE Statement") operation on
  an [`NDB`](mysql-cluster.md "Chapter 25 MySQL NDB Cluster 8.0") table frees the memory
  that was used by this table for re-use by any
  [`NDB`](mysql-cluster.md "Chapter 25 MySQL NDB Cluster 8.0") table, either by the same
  table or by another [`NDB`](mysql-cluster.md "Chapter 25 MySQL NDB Cluster 8.0") table.

  Note

  Recall that [`TRUNCATE TABLE`](truncate-table.md "15.1.37 TRUNCATE TABLE Statement")
  drops and re-creates the table. See
  [Section 15.1.37, “TRUNCATE TABLE Statement”](truncate-table.md "15.1.37 TRUNCATE TABLE Statement").
- **Limits imposed by the cluster's configuration.**
  A number of hard limits exist which are configurable, but
  available main memory in the cluster sets limits. See the
  complete list of configuration parameters in
  [Section 25.4.3, “NDB Cluster Configuration Files”](mysql-cluster-config-file.md "25.4.3 NDB Cluster Configuration Files"). Most
  configuration parameters can be upgraded online. These
  hard limits include:

  - Database memory size and index memory size
    ([`DataMemory`](mysql-cluster-ndbd-definition.md#ndbparam-ndbd-datamemory) and
    [`IndexMemory`](mysql-cluster-ndbd-definition.md#ndbparam-ndbd-indexmemory),
    respectively).

    [`DataMemory`](mysql-cluster-ndbd-definition.md#ndbparam-ndbd-datamemory) is
    allocated as 32KB pages. As each
    [`DataMemory`](mysql-cluster-ndbd-definition.md#ndbparam-ndbd-datamemory) page
    is used, it is assigned to a specific table; once
    allocated, this memory cannot be freed except by
    dropping the table.

    See [Section 25.4.3.6, “Defining NDB Cluster Data Nodes”](mysql-cluster-ndbd-definition.md "25.4.3.6 Defining NDB Cluster Data Nodes"), for
    more information.
  - The maximum number of operations that can be performed
    per transaction is set using the configuration
    parameters
    [`MaxNoOfConcurrentOperations`](mysql-cluster-ndbd-definition.md#ndbparam-ndbd-maxnoofconcurrentoperations)
    and
    [`MaxNoOfLocalOperations`](mysql-cluster-ndbd-definition.md#ndbparam-ndbd-maxnooflocaloperations).

    Note

    Bulk loading, [`TRUNCATE
    TABLE`](truncate-table.md "15.1.37 TRUNCATE TABLE Statement"), and [`ALTER
    TABLE`](alter-table.md "15.1.9 ALTER TABLE Statement") are handled as special cases by
    running multiple transactions, and so are not subject
    to this limitation.
  - Different limits related to tables and indexes. For
    example, the maximum number of ordered indexes in the
    cluster is determined by
    [`MaxNoOfOrderedIndexes`](mysql-cluster-ndbd-definition.md#ndbparam-ndbd-maxnooforderedindexes),
    and the maximum number of ordered indexes per table is
    16.
- **Node and data object maximums.**
  The following limits apply to numbers of cluster nodes and
  metadata objects:

  - The maximum number of data nodes is 144. (In NDB 7.6 and
    earlier, this was 48.)

    A data node must have a node ID in the range of 1 to
    144, inclusive.

    Management and API nodes may use node IDs in the range 1
    to 255, inclusive.
  - The total maximum number of nodes in an NDB Cluster is
    255. This number includes all SQL nodes (MySQL Servers),
    API nodes (applications accessing the cluster other than
    MySQL servers), data nodes, and management servers.
  - The maximum number of metadata objects in current
    versions of NDB Cluster is 20320. This limit is
    hard-coded.
