#### 8.4.4.8 Using the keyring\_okv KMIP Plugin

Note

The `keyring_okv` plugin is an extension
included in MySQL Enterprise Edition, a commercial product. To learn more about
commercial products, see <https://www.mysql.com/products/>.

The Key Management Interoperability Protocol (KMIP) enables
communication of cryptographic keys between a key management
server and its clients. The `keyring_okv`
keyring plugin uses the KMIP 1.1 protocol to communicate
securely as a client of a KMIP back end. Keyring material is
generated exclusively by the back end, not by
`keyring_okv`. The plugin works with these
KMIP-compatible products:

- Oracle Key Vault
- Gemalto SafeNet KeySecure Appliance
- Townsend Alliance Key Manager
- Entrust KeyControl

Each MySQL Server instance must be registered separately as a
client for KMIP. If two or more MySQL Server instances use the
same set of credentials, they can interfere with each other’s
functioning.

The `keyring_okv` plugin supports the functions
that comprise the standard MySQL Keyring service interface.
Keyring operations performed by those functions are accessible
at two levels:

- SQL interface: In SQL statements, call the functions
  described in
  [Section 8.4.4.15, “General-Purpose Keyring Key-Management Functions”](keyring-functions-general-purpose.md "8.4.4.15 General-Purpose Keyring Key-Management Functions").
- C interface: In C-language code, call the keyring service
  functions described in [Section 7.6.9.2, “The Keyring Service”](keyring-service.md "7.6.9.2 The Keyring Service").

Example (using the SQL interface):

```sql
SELECT keyring_key_generate('MyKey', 'AES', 32);
SELECT keyring_key_remove('MyKey');
```

For information about the characteristics of key values
permitted by `keyring_okv`,
[Section 8.4.4.13, “Supported Keyring Key Types and Lengths”](keyring-key-types.md "8.4.4.13 Supported Keyring Key Types and Lengths").

To install `keyring_okv`, use the general
instructions found in
[Section 8.4.4.3, “Keyring Plugin Installation”](keyring-plugin-installation.md "8.4.4.3 Keyring Plugin Installation"), together with the
configuration information specific to
`keyring_okv` found here.

##### General keyring\_okv Configuration

Regardless of which KMIP back end the
`keyring_okv` plugin uses for keyring
storage, the
[`keyring_okv_conf_dir`](keyring-system-variables.md#sysvar_keyring_okv_conf_dir) system
variable configures the location of the directory used by
`keyring_okv` for its support files. The
default value is empty, so you must set the variable to name a
properly configured directory before the plugin can
communicate with the KMIP back end. Unless you do so,
`keyring_okv` writes a message to the error
log during server startup that it cannot communicate:

```none
[Warning] Plugin keyring_okv reported: 'For keyring_okv to be
initialized, please point the keyring_okv_conf_dir variable to a directory
containing Oracle Key Vault configuration file and ssl materials'
```

The [`keyring_okv_conf_dir`](keyring-system-variables.md#sysvar_keyring_okv_conf_dir)
variable must name a directory that contains the following
items:

- `okvclient.ora`: A file that contains
  details of the KMIP back end with which
  `keyring_okv` communicates.
- `ssl`: A directory that contains the
  certificate and key files required to establish a secure
  connection with the KMIP back end:
  `CA.pem`,
  `cert.pem`, and
  `key.pem`. If the key file is
  password-protected, the `ssl` directory
  can contain a single-line text file named
  `password.txt` containing the password
  needed to decrypt the key file.

Both the `okvclient.ora` file and
`ssl` directory with the certificate and
key files are required for `keyring_okv` to
work properly. The procedure used to populate the
configuration directory with these files depends on the KMIP
back end used with `keyring_okv`, as
described elsewhere.

The configuration directory used by
`keyring_okv` as the location for its support
files should have a restrictive mode and be accessible only to
the account used to run the MySQL server. For example, on Unix
and Unix-like systems, to use the
`/usr/local/mysql/mysql-keyring-okv`
directory, the following commands (executed as
`root`) create the directory and set its mode
and ownership:

```terminal
cd /usr/local/mysql
mkdir mysql-keyring-okv
chmod 750 mysql-keyring-okv
chown mysql mysql-keyring-okv
chgrp mysql mysql-keyring-okv
```

To be usable during the server startup process,
`keyring_okv` must be loaded using the
[`--early-plugin-load`](server-options.md#option_mysqld_early-plugin-load) option.
Also, set the
[`keyring_okv_conf_dir`](keyring-system-variables.md#sysvar_keyring_okv_conf_dir) system
variable to tell `keyring_okv` where to find
its configuration directory. For example, use these lines in
the server `my.cnf` file, adjusting the
`.so` suffix and directory location for
your platform as necessary:

```ini
[mysqld]
early-plugin-load=keyring_okv.so
keyring_okv_conf_dir=/usr/local/mysql/mysql-keyring-okv
```

For additional information about
[`keyring_okv_conf_dir`](keyring-system-variables.md#sysvar_keyring_okv_conf_dir), see
[Section 8.4.4.19, “Keyring System Variables”](keyring-system-variables.md "8.4.4.19 Keyring System Variables").

##### Configuring keyring\_okv for Oracle Key Vault

The discussion here assumes that you are familiar with Oracle
Key Vault. Some pertinent information sources:

- [Oracle
  Key Vault site](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/database/options/key-management/overview/index.html)
- [Oracle
  Key Vault documentation](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/database/options/key-management/documentation/index.html)

In Oracle Key Vault terminology, clients that use Oracle Key
Vault to store and retrieve security objects are called
endpoints. To communicate with Oracle Key Vault, it is
necessary to register as an endpoint and enroll by downloading
and installing endpoint support files. Note that you must
register a separate endpoint for each MySQL Server instance.
If two or more MySQL Server instances use the same endpoint,
they can interfere with each other’s functioning.

The following procedure briefly summarizes the process of
setting up `keyring_okv` for use with Oracle
Key Vault:

1. Create the configuration directory for the
   `keyring_okv` plugin to use.
2. Register an endpoint with Oracle Key Vault to obtain an
   enrollment token.
3. Use the enrollment token to obtain the
   `okvclient.jar` client software
   download.
4. Install the client software to populate the
   `keyring_okv` configuration directory
   that contains the Oracle Key Vault support files.

To get more information about these steps, see
[Enrolling
and Upgrading Endpoints for Oracle Key Vault](https://docs.oracle.com/en/database/oracle/key-vault/21.11/okvag/okv_endpoints.html#GUID-5C1A6874-C7A9-41C6-859D-9FFD9010E13D). The
information references Oracle Database, but you can follow the
same steps for MySQL.

Use the following procedure to configure
`keyring_okv` and Oracle Key Vault to work
together. This description only summarizes how to interact
with Oracle Key Vault. For details, visit the
[Oracle
Key Vault](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/database/options/key-management/overview/index.html) site and consult the *Oracle Key
Vault Administrator's Guide*.

1. Create the configuration directory that contains the
   Oracle Key Vault support files, and make sure that the
   [`keyring_okv_conf_dir`](keyring-system-variables.md#sysvar_keyring_okv_conf_dir)
   system variable is set to name that directory (for
   details, see [General keyring\_okv Configuration](keyring-okv-plugin.md#keyring-okv-configuration "General keyring_okv Configuration")).
2. Log in to the Oracle Key Vault management console as a
   user who has the System Administrator role.
3. Select the Endpoints tab to arrive at the Endpoints page.
   On the Endpoints page, click Add.
4. Provide the required endpoint information and click
   Register. The endpoint type should be Other. Successful
   registration results in an enrollment token.
5. Log out from the Oracle Key Vault server.
6. Connect again to the Oracle Key Vault server, this time
   without logging in. Use the endpoint enrollment token to
   enroll and request the `okvclient.jar`
   software download. Save this file to your system.
7. Install the `okvclient.jar` file using
   the following command (you must have JDK 1.4 or higher):

   ```terminal
   java -jar okvclient.jar -d dir_name [-v]
   ```

   The directory name following the `-d`
   option is the location in which to install extracted
   files. The `-v` option, if given, causes
   log information to be produced that may be useful if the
   command fails.

   When the command asks for an Oracle Key Vault endpoint
   password, do not provide one. Instead, press
   **Enter**. (The result is that no password is
   required when the endpoint connects to Oracle Key Vault.)

   The preceding command produces an
   `okvclient.ora` file, which should be
   in this location under the directory named by the
   `-d` option in the preceding **java
   -jar** command:

   ```terminal
   install_dir/conf/okvclient.ora
   ```

   The expected file contents include lines that look like
   this:

   ```ini
   SERVER=host_ip:port_num
   STANDBY_SERVER=host_ip:port_num
   ```

   The `SERVER` variable is mandatory, and
   the `STANDBY_SERVER` variable is
   optional. The `keyring_okv` plugin
   attempts to communicate with the server running on the
   host named by the `SERVER` variable and
   falls back to `STANDBY_SERVER` if that
   fails.

   Note

   If the existing file is not in this format, then create
   a new file with the lines shown in the previous example.
   Also, consider backing up the
   `okvclient.ora` file before you run
   the **okvutil** command. Restore the file
   as needed.

   From MySQL 8.0.29, you can specify more than one standby
   server (up to a maximum of 64). If you do, the
   `keyring_okv` plugin iterates over them
   until it can establish a connection, and fails if it
   cannot. To add extra standby servers, edit the
   `okvclient.ora` file to specify the IP
   addresses and port numbers of the servers as a
   comma-separated list in the value of the
   `STANDBY_SERVER` variable. For example:

   ```ini
   STANDBY_SERVER=host_ip:port_num,host_ip:port_num,host_ip:port_num,host_ip:port_num
   ```

   Ensure that the list of standby servers is kept short,
   accurate, and up to date, and servers that are no longer
   valid are removed. There is a 20-second wait for each
   connection attempt, so the presence of a long list of
   invalid servers can significantly affect the
   `keyring_okv` plugin’s connection time
   and therefore the server startup time.
8. Go to the Oracle Key Vault installer directory and test
   the setup by running this command:

   ```terminal
   okvutil/bin/okvutil list
   ```

   The output should look something like this:

   ```none
   Unique ID                               Type            Identifier
   255AB8DE-C97F-482C-E053-0100007F28B9	Symmetric Key	-
   264BF6E0-A20E-7C42-E053-0100007FB29C	Symmetric Key	-
   ```

   For a fresh Oracle Key Vault server (a server without any
   key in it), the output looks like this instead, to
   indicate that there are no keys in the vault:

   ```none
   no objects found
   ```
9. Use this command to extract the `ssl`
   directory containing SSL materials from the
   `okvclient.jar` file:

   ```terminal
   jar xf okvclient.jar ssl
   ```
10. Copy the Oracle Key Vault support files (the
    `okvclient.ora` file and the
    `ssl` directory) into the configuration
    directory.
11. (Optional) If you wish to password-protect the key file,
    use the instructions in
    [Password-Protecting the keyring\_okv Key File](keyring-okv-plugin.md#keyring-okv-encrypt-key-file "Password-Protecting the keyring_okv Key File").

After completing the preceding procedure, restart the MySQL
server. It loads the `keyring_okv` plugin and
`keyring_okv` uses the files in its
configuration directory to communicate with Oracle Key Vault.

##### Configuring keyring\_okv for Gemalto SafeNet KeySecure Appliance

Gemalto SafeNet KeySecure Appliance uses the KMIP protocol
(version 1.1 or 1.2). The `keyring_okv`
keyring plugin (which supports KMIP 1.1) can use KeySecure as
its KMIP back end for keyring storage.

Use the following procedure to configure
`keyring_okv` and KeySecure to work together.
The description only summarizes how to interact with
KeySecure. For details, consult the section named Add a KMIP
Server in the
[KeySecure
User Guide](https://www2.gemalto.com/aws-marketplace/usage/vks/uploadedFiles/Support_and_Downloads/AWS/007-012362-001-keysecure-appliance-user-guide-v7.1.0.pdf).

1. Create the configuration directory that contains the
   KeySecure support files, and make sure that the
   [`keyring_okv_conf_dir`](keyring-system-variables.md#sysvar_keyring_okv_conf_dir)
   system variable is set to name that directory (for
   details, see [General keyring\_okv Configuration](keyring-okv-plugin.md#keyring-okv-configuration "General keyring_okv Configuration")).
2. In the configuration directory, create a subdirectory
   named `ssl` to use for storing the
   required SSL certificate and key files.
3. In the configuration directory, create a file named
   `okvclient.ora`. It should have
   following format:

   ```ini
   SERVER=host_ip:port_num
   STANDBY_SERVER=host_ip:port_num
   ```

   For example, if KeySecure is running on host 198.51.100.20
   and listening on port 9002, and also running on
   alternative host 203.0.113.125 and listening on port 8041,
   the `okvclient.ora` file looks like
   this:

   ```ini
   SERVER=198.51.100.20:9002
   STANDBY_SERVER=203.0.113.125:8041
   ```

   From MySQL 8.0.29, you can specify more than one standby
   server (up to a maximum of 64). If you do, the
   `keyring_okv` plugin iterates over them
   until it can establish a connection, and fails if it
   cannot. To add extra standby servers, edit the
   `okvclient.ora` file to specify the IP
   addresses and port numbers of the servers as a
   comma-separated list in the value of the
   `STANDBY_SERVER` variable. For example:

   ```ini
   STANDBY_SERVER=host_ip:port_num,host_ip:port_num,host_ip:port_num,host_ip:port_num
   ```

   Ensure that the list of standby servers is kept short,
   accurate, and up to date, and servers that are no longer
   valid are removed. There is a 20-second wait for each
   connection attempt, so the presence of a long list of
   invalid servers can significantly affect the
   `keyring_okv` plugin’s connection time
   and therefore the server startup time.
4. Connect to the KeySecure Management Console as an
   administrator with credentials for Certificate Authorities
   access.
5. Navigate to Security >> Local CAs and create a local
   certificate authority (CA).
6. Go to Trusted CA Lists. Select Default and click on
   Properties. Then select Edit for Trusted Certificate
   Authority List and add the CA just created.
7. Download the CA and save it in the
   `ssl` directory as a file named
   `CA.pem`.
8. Navigate to Security >> Certificate Requests and
   create a certificate. Then you can download a compressed
   **tar** file containing certificate PEM
   files.
9. Extract the PEM files from in the downloaded file. For
   example, if the file name is
   `csr_w_pk_pkcs8.gz`, decompress and
   unpack it using this command:

   ```terminal
   tar zxvf csr_w_pk_pkcs8.gz
   ```

   Two files result from the extraction operation:
   `certificate_request.pem` and
   `private_key_pkcs8.pem`.
10. Use this **openssl** command to decrypt the
    private key and create a file named
    `key.pem`:

    ```terminal
    openssl pkcs8 -in private_key_pkcs8.pem -out key.pem
    ```
11. Copy the `key.pem` file into the
    `ssl` directory.
12. Copy the certificate request in
    `certificate_request.pem` into the
    clipboard.
13. Navigate to Security >> Local CAs. Select the same
    CA that you created earlier (the one you downloaded to
    create the `CA.pem` file), and click
    Sign Request. Paste the Certificate Request from the
    clipboard, choose a certificate purpose of Client (the
    keyring is a client of KeySecure), and click Sign Request.
    The result is a certificate signed with the selected CA in
    a new page.
14. Copy the signed certificate to the clipboard, then save
    the clipboard contents as a file named
    `cert.pem` in the
    `ssl` directory.
15. (Optional) If you wish to password-protect the key file,
    use the instructions in
    [Password-Protecting the keyring\_okv Key File](keyring-okv-plugin.md#keyring-okv-encrypt-key-file "Password-Protecting the keyring_okv Key File").

After completing the preceding procedure, restart the MySQL
server. It loads the `keyring_okv` plugin and
`keyring_okv` uses the files in its
configuration directory to communicate with KeySecure.

##### Configuring keyring\_okv for Townsend Alliance Key Manager

Townsend Alliance Key Manager uses the KMIP protocol. The
`keyring_okv` keyring plugin can use Alliance
Key Manager as its KMIP back end for keyring storage. For
additional information, see
[Alliance
Key Manager for MySQL](https://www.townsendsecurity.com/product/encryption-key-management-mysql).

##### Configuring keyring\_okv for Entrust KeyControl

Entrust KeyControl uses the KMIP protocol. The
`keyring_okv` keyring plugin can use Entrust
KeyControl as its KMIP back end for keyring storage. For
additional information, see the
[Oracle
MySQL and Entrust KeyControl with nShield HSM Integration
Guide](https://www.entrust.com/-/media/documentation/integration-guides/oracle-mysql-enterprise-keycontrol-nshield-ig.pdf).

##### Password-Protecting the keyring\_okv Key File

You can optionally protect the key file with a password and
supply a file containing the password to enable the key file
to be decrypted. To so do, change location to the
`ssl` directory and perform these steps:

1. Encrypt the `key.pem` key file. For
   example, use a command like this, and enter the encryption
   password at the prompts:

   ```terminal
   $> openssl rsa -des3 -in key.pem -out key.pem.new
   Enter PEM pass phrase:
   Verifying - Enter PEM pass phrase:
   ```
2. Save the encryption password in a single-line text file
   named `password.txt` in the
   `ssl` directory.
3. Verify that the encrypted key file can be decrypted using
   the following command. The decrypted file should display
   on the console:

   ```terminal
   $> openssl rsa -in key.pem.new -passin file:password.txt
   ```
4. Remove the original `key.pem` file and
   rename `key.pem.new` to
   `key.pem`.
5. Change the ownership and access mode of new
   `key.pem` file and
   `password.txt` file as necessary to
   ensure that they have the same restrictions as other files
   in the `ssl` directory.
