### 2.9.1 Initializing the Data Directory

After MySQL is installed, the data directory must be initialized,
including the tables in the `mysql` system
schema:

- For some MySQL installation methods, data directory
  initialization is automatic, as described in
  [Section 2.9, “Postinstallation Setup and Testing”](postinstallation.md "2.9 Postinstallation Setup and Testing").
- For other installation methods, you must initialize the data
  directory manually. These include installation from generic
  binary and source distributions on Unix and Unix-like systems,
  and installation from a ZIP Archive package on Windows.

This section describes how to initialize the data directory
manually for MySQL installation methods for which data directory
initialization is not automatic. For some suggested commands that
enable testing whether the server is accessible and working
properly, see [Section 2.9.3, “Testing the Server”](testing-server.md "2.9.3 Testing the Server").

Note

In MySQL 8.0, the default authentication plugin has changed from
`mysql_native_password` to
`caching_sha2_password`, and the
`'root'@'localhost'` administrative account
uses `caching_sha2_password` by default. If you
prefer that the `root` account use the previous
default authentication plugin
(`mysql_native_password`), see
[caching\_sha2\_password and the root Administrative Account](upgrading-from-previous-series.md#upgrade-caching-sha2-password-root-account "caching_sha2_password and the root Administrative Account").

The `mysql_native_password` plugin is
deprecated as of MySQL 8.0.34, disabled by default as of MySQL
8.4.0, and removed as of MySQL 9.0.0.

#### Data Directory Initialization Overview

In the examples shown here, the server is intended to run under
the user ID of the `mysql` login account.
Either create the account if it does not exist (see
[Create a mysql User and Group](binary-installation.md#binary-installation-createsysuser "Create a mysql User and Group")), or
substitute the name of a different existing login account that
you plan to use for running the server.

1. Change location to the top-level directory of your MySQL
   installation, which is typically
   `/usr/local/mysql` (adjust the path name
   for your system as necessary):

   ```terminal
   cd /usr/local/mysql
   ```

   Within this directory you can find several files and
   subdirectories, including the `bin`
   subdirectory that contains the server, as well as client and
   utility programs.
2. The [`secure_file_priv`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_secure_file_priv) system
   variable limits import and export operations to a specific
   directory. Create a directory whose location can be
   specified as the value of that variable:

   ```terminal
   mkdir mysql-files
   ```

   Grant directory user and group ownership to the
   `mysql` user and `mysql`
   group, and set the directory permissions appropriately:

   ```terminal
   chown mysql:mysql mysql-files
   chmod 750 mysql-files
   ```
3. Use the server to initialize the data directory, including
   the `mysql` schema containing the initial
   MySQL grant tables that determine how users are permitted to
   connect to the server. For example:

   ```terminal
   bin/mysqld --initialize --user=mysql
   ```

   For important information about the command, especially
   regarding command options you might use, see
   [Data Directory Initialization Procedure](data-directory-initialization.md#data-directory-initialization-procedure "Data Directory Initialization Procedure").
   For details about how the server performs initialization,
   see
   [Server Actions During Data Directory Initialization](data-directory-initialization.md#data-directory-initialization-server-actions "Server Actions During Data Directory Initialization").

   Typically, data directory initialization need be done only
   after you first install MySQL. (For upgrades to an existing
   installation, perform the upgrade procedure instead; see
   [Chapter 3, *Upgrading MySQL*](upgrading.md "Chapter 3 Upgrading MySQL").) However, the command that
   initializes the data directory does not overwrite any
   existing `mysql` schema tables, so it is
   safe to run in any circumstances.
4. If you want to deploy the server with automatic support for
   secure connections, use the
   [**mysql\_ssl\_rsa\_setup**](mysql-ssl-rsa-setup.md "6.4.3 mysql_ssl_rsa_setup — Create SSL/RSA Files") utility to create
   default SSL and RSA files:

   ```terminal
   bin/mysql_ssl_rsa_setup
   ```

   For more information, see
   [Section 6.4.3, “mysql\_ssl\_rsa\_setup — Create SSL/RSA Files”](mysql-ssl-rsa-setup.md "6.4.3 mysql_ssl_rsa_setup — Create SSL/RSA Files").

   Note

   The [**mysql\_ssl\_rsa\_setup**](mysql-ssl-rsa-setup.md "6.4.3 mysql_ssl_rsa_setup — Create SSL/RSA Files") utility is
   deprecated as of MySQL 8.0.34.
5. In the absence of any option files, the server starts with
   its default settings. (See
   [Section 7.1.2, “Server Configuration Defaults”](server-configuration-defaults.md "7.1.2 Server Configuration Defaults").) To
   explicitly specify options that the MySQL server should use
   at startup, put them in an option file such as
   `/etc/my.cnf` or
   `/etc/mysql/my.cnf`. (See
   [Section 6.2.2.2, “Using Option Files”](option-files.md "6.2.2.2 Using Option Files").) For example, you can use an
   option file to set the
   [`secure_file_priv`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_secure_file_priv) system
   variable.
6. To arrange for MySQL to start without manual intervention at
   system boot time, see [Section 2.9.5, “Starting and Stopping MySQL Automatically”](automatic-start.md "2.9.5 Starting and Stopping MySQL Automatically").
7. Data directory initialization creates time zone tables in
   the `mysql` schema but does not populate
   them. To do so, use the instructions in
   [Section 7.1.15, “MySQL Server Time Zone Support”](time-zone-support.md "7.1.15 MySQL Server Time Zone Support").

#### Data Directory Initialization Procedure

Change location to the top-level directory of your MySQL
installation, which is typically
`/usr/local/mysql` (adjust the path name for
your system as necessary):

```terminal
cd /usr/local/mysql
```

To initialize the data directory, invoke
[**mysqld**](mysqld.md "6.3.1 mysqld — The MySQL Server") with the
[`--initialize`](server-options.md#option_mysqld_initialize) or
[`--initialize-insecure`](server-options.md#option_mysqld_initialize-insecure) option,
depending on whether you want the server to generate a random
initial password for the `'root'@'localhost'`
account, or to create that account with no password:

- Use [`--initialize`](server-options.md#option_mysqld_initialize) for
  “secure by default” installation (that is,
  including generation of a random initial
  `root` password). In this case, the
  password is marked as expired and you must choose a new one.
- With [`--initialize-insecure`](server-options.md#option_mysqld_initialize-insecure),
  no `root` password is generated. This is
  insecure; it is assumed that you intend to assign a password
  to the account in a timely fashion before putting the server
  into production use.

For instructions on assigning a new
`'root'@'localhost'` password, see
[Post-Initialization root Password Assignment](data-directory-initialization.md#data-directory-initialization-password-assignment "Post-Initialization root Password Assignment").

Note

The server writes any messages (including any initial
password) to its standard error output. This may be redirected
to the error log, so look there if you do not see the messages
on your screen. For information about the error log, including
where it is located, see [Section 7.4.2, “The Error Log”](error-log.md "7.4.2 The Error Log").

On Windows, use the [`--console`](server-options.md#option_mysqld_console)
option to direct messages to the console.

On Unix and Unix-like systems, it is important for the database
directories and files to be owned by the
`mysql` login account so that the server has
read and write access to them when you run it later. To ensure
this, start [**mysqld**](mysqld.md "6.3.1 mysqld — The MySQL Server") from the system
`root` account and include the
[`--user`](server-options.md#option_mysqld_user) option as shown here:

```terminal
bin/mysqld --initialize --user=mysql
bin/mysqld --initialize-insecure --user=mysql
```

Alternatively, execute [**mysqld**](mysqld.md "6.3.1 mysqld — The MySQL Server") while logged in
as `mysql`, in which case you can omit the
[`--user`](server-options.md#option_mysqld_user) option from the command.

On Windows, use one of these commands:

```terminal
bin\mysqld --initialize --console
bin\mysqld --initialize-insecure --console
```

Note

Data directory initialization might fail if required system
libraries are missing. For example, you might see an error
like this:

```terminal
bin/mysqld: error while loading shared libraries:
libnuma.so.1: cannot open shared object file:
No such file or directory
```

If this happens, you must install the missing libraries
manually or with your system's package manager. Then
retry the data directory initialization command.

It might be necessary to specify other options such as
[`--basedir`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_basedir) or
[`--datadir`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_datadir) if
[**mysqld**](mysqld.md "6.3.1 mysqld — The MySQL Server") cannot identify the correct locations
for the installation directory or data directory. For example
(enter the command on a single line):

```terminal
bin/mysqld --initialize --user=mysql
  --basedir=/opt/mysql/mysql
  --datadir=/opt/mysql/mysql/data
```

Alternatively, put the relevant option settings in an option
file and pass the name of that file to
[**mysqld**](mysqld.md "6.3.1 mysqld — The MySQL Server"). For Unix and Unix-like systems,
suppose that the option file name is
`/opt/mysql/mysql/etc/my.cnf`. Put these
lines in the file:

```ini
[mysqld]
basedir=/opt/mysql/mysql
datadir=/opt/mysql/mysql/data
```

Then invoke [**mysqld**](mysqld.md "6.3.1 mysqld — The MySQL Server") as follows (enter the
command on a single line, with the
[`--defaults-file`](option-file-options.md#option_general_defaults-file) option first):

```terminal
bin/mysqld --defaults-file=/opt/mysql/mysql/etc/my.cnf
  --initialize --user=mysql
```

On Windows, suppose that `C:\my.ini` contains
these lines:

```ini
[mysqld]
basedir=C:\\Program Files\\MySQL\\MySQL Server 8.0
datadir=D:\\MySQLdata
```

Then invoke [**mysqld**](mysqld.md "6.3.1 mysqld — The MySQL Server") as follows (again, you
should enter the command on a single line, with the
[`--defaults-file`](option-file-options.md#option_general_defaults-file) option first):

```terminal
bin\mysqld --defaults-file=C:\my.ini
   --initialize --console
```

Important

When initializing the data directory, you should not specify
any options other than those used for setting directory
locations such as [`--basedir`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_basedir) or
[`--datadir`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_datadir), and the
[`--user`](server-options.md#option_mysqld_user) option if needed.
Options to be employed by the MySQL server during normal use
can be set when restarting it following initialization. See
the description of the
[`--initialize`](server-options.md#option_mysqld_initialize) option for further
information.

#### Server Actions During Data Directory Initialization

Note

The data directory initialization sequence performed by the
server does not substitute for the actions performed by
[**mysql\_secure\_installation**](mysql-secure-installation.md "6.4.2 mysql_secure_installation — Improve MySQL Installation Security") and
[**mysql\_ssl\_rsa\_setup**](mysql-ssl-rsa-setup.md "6.4.3 mysql_ssl_rsa_setup — Create SSL/RSA Files"). See
[Section 6.4.2, “mysql\_secure\_installation — Improve MySQL Installation Security”](mysql-secure-installation.md "6.4.2 mysql_secure_installation — Improve MySQL Installation Security"), and
[Section 6.4.3, “mysql\_ssl\_rsa\_setup — Create SSL/RSA Files”](mysql-ssl-rsa-setup.md "6.4.3 mysql_ssl_rsa_setup — Create SSL/RSA Files").

When invoked with the
[`--initialize`](server-options.md#option_mysqld_initialize) or
[`--initialize-insecure`](server-options.md#option_mysqld_initialize-insecure) option,
[**mysqld**](mysqld.md "6.3.1 mysqld — The MySQL Server") performs the following actions during
the data directory initialization sequence:

1. The server checks for the existence of the data directory as
   follows:

   - If no data directory exists, the server creates it.
   - If the data directory exists but is not empty (that is,
     it contains files or subdirectories), the server exits
     after producing an error message:

     ```none
     [ERROR] --initialize specified but the data directory exists. Aborting.
     ```

     In this case, remove or rename the data directory and
     try again.

     An existing data directory is permitted to be nonempty
     if every entry has a name that begins with a period
     (`.`).
2. Within the data directory, the server creates the
   `mysql` system schema and its tables,
   including the data dictionary tables, grant tables, time
   zone tables, and server-side help tables. See
   [Section 7.3, “The mysql System Schema”](system-schema.md "7.3 The mysql System Schema").
3. The server initializes the
   [system
   tablespace](glossary.md#glos_system_tablespace "system tablespace") and related data structures needed to
   manage [`InnoDB`](innodb-storage-engine.md "Chapter 17 The InnoDB Storage Engine") tables.

   Note

   After [**mysqld**](mysqld.md "6.3.1 mysqld — The MySQL Server") sets up the
   `InnoDB`
   [system
   tablespace](glossary.md#glos_system_tablespace "system tablespace"), certain changes to tablespace
   characteristics require setting up a whole new
   [instance](glossary.md#glos_instance "instance"). Qualifying
   changes include the file name of the first file in the
   system tablespace and the number of undo logs. If you do
   not want to use the default values, make sure that the
   settings for the
   [`innodb_data_file_path`](innodb-parameters.md#sysvar_innodb_data_file_path) and
   [`innodb_log_file_size`](innodb-parameters.md#sysvar_innodb_log_file_size)
   configuration parameters are in place in the MySQL
   [configuration
   file](glossary.md#glos_configuration_file "configuration file") *before* running
   [**mysqld**](mysqld.md "6.3.1 mysqld — The MySQL Server"). Also make sure to specify as
   necessary other parameters that affect the creation and
   location of `InnoDB` files, such as
   [`innodb_data_home_dir`](innodb-parameters.md#sysvar_innodb_data_home_dir) and
   [`innodb_log_group_home_dir`](innodb-parameters.md#sysvar_innodb_log_group_home_dir).

   If those options are in your configuration file but that
   file is not in a location that MySQL reads by default,
   specify the file location using the
   [`--defaults-extra-file`](server-options.md#option_mysqld_defaults-extra-file)
   option when you run [**mysqld**](mysqld.md "6.3.1 mysqld — The MySQL Server").
4. The server creates a `'root'@'localhost'`
   superuser account and other reserved accounts (see
   [Section 8.2.9, “Reserved Accounts”](reserved-accounts.md "8.2.9 Reserved Accounts")). Some reserved accounts
   are locked and cannot be used by clients, but
   `'root'@'localhost'` is intended for
   administrative use and you should assign it a password.

   Server actions with respect to a password for the
   `'root'@'localhost'` account depend on how
   you invoke it:

   - With [`--initialize`](server-options.md#option_mysqld_initialize) but not
     [`--initialize-insecure`](server-options.md#option_mysqld_initialize-insecure),
     the server generates a random password, marks it as
     expired, and writes a message displaying the password:

     ```none
     [Warning] A temporary password is generated for root@localhost:
     iTag*AfrH5ej
     ```
   - With
     [`--initialize-insecure`](server-options.md#option_mysqld_initialize-insecure),
     (either with or without
     [`--initialize`](server-options.md#option_mysqld_initialize) because
     [`--initialize-insecure`](server-options.md#option_mysqld_initialize-insecure)
     implies [`--initialize`](server-options.md#option_mysqld_initialize)),
     the server does not generate a password or mark it
     expired, and writes a warning message:

     ```none
     [Warning] root@localhost is created with an empty password ! Please
     consider switching off the --initialize-insecure option.
     ```

   For instructions on assigning a new
   `'root'@'localhost'` password, see
   [Post-Initialization root Password Assignment](data-directory-initialization.md#data-directory-initialization-password-assignment "Post-Initialization root Password Assignment").
5. The server populates the server-side help tables used for
   the [`HELP`](help.md "15.8.3 HELP Statement") statement (see
   [Section 15.8.3, “HELP Statement”](help.md "15.8.3 HELP Statement")). The server does not populate the
   time zone tables. To do so manually, see
   [Section 7.1.15, “MySQL Server Time Zone Support”](time-zone-support.md "7.1.15 MySQL Server Time Zone Support").
6. If the [`init_file`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_init_file) system
   variable was given to name a file of SQL statements, the
   server executes the statements in the file. This option
   enables you to perform custom bootstrapping sequences.

   When the server operates in bootstrap mode, some
   functionality is unavailable that limits the statements
   permitted in the file. These include statements that relate
   to account management (such as [`CREATE
   USER`](create-user.md "15.7.1.3 CREATE USER Statement") or [`GRANT`](grant.md "15.7.1.6 GRANT Statement")),
   replication, and global transaction identifiers.
7. The server exits.

#### Post-Initialization root Password Assignment

After you initialize the data directory by starting the server
with [`--initialize`](server-options.md#option_mysqld_initialize) or
[`--initialize-insecure`](server-options.md#option_mysqld_initialize-insecure), start the
server normally (that is, without either of those options) and
assign the `'root'@'localhost'` account a new
password:

1. Start the server. For instructions, see
   [Section 2.9.2, “Starting the Server”](starting-server.md "2.9.2 Starting the Server").
2. Connect to the server:

   - If you used [`--initialize`](server-options.md#option_mysqld_initialize)
     but not
     [`--initialize-insecure`](server-options.md#option_mysqld_initialize-insecure) to
     initialize the data directory, connect to the server as
     `root`:

     ```terminal
     mysql -u root -p
     ```

     Then, at the password prompt, enter the random password
     that the server generated during the initialization
     sequence:

     ```none
     Enter password: (enter the random root password here)
     ```

     Look in the server error log if you do not know this
     password.
   - If you used
     [`--initialize-insecure`](server-options.md#option_mysqld_initialize-insecure) to
     initialize the data directory, connect to the server as
     `root` without a password:

     ```terminal
     mysql -u root --skip-password
     ```
3. After connecting, use an [`ALTER
   USER`](alter-user.md "15.7.1.1 ALTER USER Statement") statement to assign a new
   `root` password:

   ```sql
   ALTER USER 'root'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'root-password';
   ```

See also [Section 2.9.4, “Securing the Initial MySQL Account”](default-privileges.md "2.9.4 Securing the Initial MySQL Account").

Note

Attempts to connect to the host `127.0.0.1`
normally resolve to the `localhost` account.
However, this fails if the server is run with
[`skip_name_resolve`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_skip_name_resolve) enabled. If
you plan to do that, make sure that an account exists that can
accept a connection. For example, to be able to connect as
`root` using
`--host=127.0.0.1` or
`--host=::1`, create these accounts:

```sql
CREATE USER 'root'@'127.0.0.1' IDENTIFIED BY 'root-password';
CREATE USER 'root'@'::1' IDENTIFIED BY 'root-password';
```

It is possible to put those statements in a file to be
executed using the [`init_file`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_init_file)
system variable, as discussed in
[Server Actions During Data Directory Initialization](data-directory-initialization.md#data-directory-initialization-server-actions "Server Actions During Data Directory Initialization").
