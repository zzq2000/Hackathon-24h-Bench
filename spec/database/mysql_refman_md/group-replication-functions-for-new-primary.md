#### 14.18.1.1 Function which Configures Group Replication Primary

The following function enables you to set a member of a
single-primary replication group to take over as the primary.
The current primary becomes a read-only secondary, and the
specified group member becomes the read-write primary. The
function can be used on any member of a replication group
running in single-primary mode. This function replaces the
usual primary election process; see
[Section 20.5.1.1, “Changing the Primary”](group-replication-change-primary.md "20.5.1.1 Changing the Primary"), for more
information.

If a standard source to replica replication channel is running
on the existing primary member in addition to the Group
Replication channels, you must stop that replication channel
before you can change the primary member. You can identify the
current primary using the `MEMBER_ROLE`
column in the Performance Schema table
[`replication_group_members`](performance-schema-replication-group-members-table.md "29.12.11.16 The replication_group_members Table"), or the
[`group_replication_primary_member`](group-replication-status-variables.md#statvar_group_replication_primary_member)
status variable.

Any uncommitted transactions that the group is waiting on must
be committed, rolled back, or terminated before the operation
can complete. Before MySQL 8.0.29, the function waits for all
active transactions on the existing primary to end, including
incoming transactions that are started after the function is
used. From MySQL 8.0.29, you can specify a timeout for
transactions that are running when you use the function. For
the timeout to work, all members of the group must be at MySQL
8.0.29 or higher.

When the timeout expires, for any transactions that did not
yet reach their commit phase, the client session is
disconnected so that the transaction does not proceed.
Transactions that reached their commit phase are allowed to
complete. When you set a timeout, it also prevents new
transactions starting on the primary from that point on.
Explicitly defined transactions (with a `START
TRANSACTION` or `BEGIN` statement)
are subject to the timeout, disconnection, and incoming
transaction blocking even if they do not modify any data. To
allow inspection of the primary while the function is
operating, single statements that do not modify data, as
listed in [Permitted Queries Under Consistency Rules](group-replication-configuring-consistency-guarantees.md#group-replication-nonblocking "Permitted Queries Under Consistency Rules"), are
permitted to proceed.

- [`group_replication_set_as_primary()`](group-replication-functions-for-new-primary.md#function_group-replication-set-as-primary)

  Appoints a specific member of the group as the new
  primary, overriding any election process.

  Syntax:

  ```clike
  STRING group_replication_set_as_primary(member_uuid[, timeout])
  ```

  Arguments:

  - *`member_uuid`*: A string
    containing the UUID of the member of the group that
    you want to become the new primary.
  - *`timeout`*: An integer
    specifying a timeout in seconds for transactions that
    are running on the existing primary when you use the
    function. You can set a timeout from 0 seconds
    (immediately) up to 3600 seconds (60 minutes). When
    you set a timeout, new transactions cannot start on
    the primary from that point on. There is no default
    setting for the timeout, so if you do not set it,
    there is no upper limit to the wait time, and new
    transactions can start during that time. This option
    is available from MySQL 8.0.29.

  Return value:

  A string containing the result of the operation, for
  example whether it was successful or not.

  Example:

  ```sql
  SELECT group_replication_set_as_primary(‘00371d66-3c45-11ea-804b-080027337932’, 300);
  ```
