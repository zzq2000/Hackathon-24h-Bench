#### 19.1.2.3 Creating a User for Replication

Each replica connects to the source using a MySQL user name and
password, so there must be a user account on the source that the
replica can use to connect. The user name is specified by the
`SOURCE_USER` | `MASTER_USER`
option of the [`CHANGE REPLICATION SOURCE
TO`](change-replication-source-to.md "15.4.2.3 CHANGE REPLICATION SOURCE TO Statement") statement (from MySQL 8.0.23) or
[`CHANGE MASTER TO`](change-master-to.md "15.4.2.1 CHANGE MASTER TO Statement") statement
(before MySQL 8.0.23) when you set up a replica. Any account can
be used for this operation, providing it has been granted the
[`REPLICATION SLAVE`](privileges-provided.md#priv_replication-slave) privilege. You
can choose to create a different account for each replica, or
connect to the source using the same account for each replica.

Although you do not have to create an account specifically for
replication, you should be aware that the replication user name
and password are stored in plain text in the replica's
connection metadata repository
`mysql.slave_master_info` (see
[Section 19.2.4.2, “Replication Metadata Repositories”](replica-logs-status.md "19.2.4.2 Replication Metadata Repositories")). Therefore, you may want
to create a separate account that has privileges only for the
replication process, to minimize the possibility of compromise
to other accounts.

To create a new account, use [`CREATE
USER`](create-user.md "15.7.1.3 CREATE USER Statement"). To grant this account the privileges required
for replication, use the [`GRANT`](grant.md "15.7.1.6 GRANT Statement")
statement. If you create an account solely for the purposes of
replication, that account needs only the
[`REPLICATION SLAVE`](privileges-provided.md#priv_replication-slave) privilege. For
example, to set up a new user, `repl`, that can
connect for replication from any host within the
`example.com` domain, issue these statements on
the source:

```sql
mysql> CREATE USER 'repl'@'%.example.com' IDENTIFIED BY 'password';
mysql> GRANT REPLICATION SLAVE ON *.* TO 'repl'@'%.example.com';
```

See [Section 15.7.1, “Account Management Statements”](account-management-statements.md "15.7.1 Account Management Statements"), for more
information on statements for manipulation of user accounts.

Important

To connect to the source using a user account that
authenticates with the
`caching_sha2_password` plugin, you must
either set up a secure connection as described in
[Section 19.3.1, “Setting Up Replication to Use Encrypted Connections”](replication-encrypted-connections.md "19.3.1 Setting Up Replication to Use Encrypted Connections"), or enable
the unencrypted connection to support password exchange using
an RSA key pair. The `caching_sha2_password`
authentication plugin is the default for new users created
from MySQL 8.0 (for details, see
[Section 8.4.1.2, “Caching SHA-2 Pluggable Authentication”](caching-sha2-pluggable-authentication.md "8.4.1.2 Caching SHA-2 Pluggable Authentication")). If
the user account that you create or use for replication (as
specified by the `MASTER_USER` option) uses
this authentication plugin, and you are not using a secure
connection, you must enable RSA key pair-based password
exchange for a successful connection.
