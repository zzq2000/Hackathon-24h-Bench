## 11.3 Keywords and Reserved Words

Keywords are words that have significance in SQL. Certain
keywords, such as [`SELECT`](select.md "15.2.13 SELECT Statement"),
[`DELETE`](delete.md "15.2.2 DELETE Statement"), or
[`BIGINT`](integer-types.md "13.1.2 Integer Types (Exact Value) - INTEGER, INT, SMALLINT, TINYINT, MEDIUMINT, BIGINT"), are reserved and require
special treatment for use as identifiers such as table and column
names. This may also be true for the names of built-in functions.

Most nonreserved keywords are permitted as identifiers without
quoting. Some keywords which are otherwise considered nonreserved
are restricted from use as unquoted identifiers for roles, stored
program labels, or, in some cases, both. See
[MySQL 8.0 Restricted Keywords](keywords.md#keywords-restricted "MySQL 8.0 Restricted Keywords"), for listings of these
keywords.

Reserved words are permitted as identifiers if you quote them as
described in [Section 11.2, “Schema Object Names”](identifiers.md "11.2 Schema Object Names"):

```sql
mysql> CREATE TABLE interval (begin INT, end INT);
ERROR 1064 (42000): You have an error in your SQL syntax ...
near 'interval (begin INT, end INT)'
```

`BEGIN` and `END` are keywords
but not reserved, so their use as identifiers does not require
quoting. `INTERVAL` is a reserved keyword and
must be quoted to be used as an identifier:

```sql
mysql> CREATE TABLE `interval` (begin INT, end INT);
Query OK, 0 rows affected (0.01 sec)
```

Exception: A word that follows a period in a qualified name must
be an identifier, so it need not be quoted even if it is reserved:

```sql
mysql> CREATE TABLE mydb.interval (begin INT, end INT);
Query OK, 0 rows affected (0.01 sec)
```

Names of built-in functions are permitted as identifiers but may
require care to be used as such. For example,
`COUNT` is acceptable as a column name. However,
by default, no whitespace is permitted in function invocations
between the function name and the following `(`
character. This requirement enables the parser to distinguish
whether the name is used in a function call or in nonfunction
context. For further details on recognition of function names, see
[Section 11.2.5, “Function Name Parsing and Resolution”](function-resolution.md "11.2.5 Function Name Parsing and Resolution").

The `INFORMATION_SCHEMA.KEYWORDS` table lists the
words considered keywords by MySQL and indicates whether they are
reserved. See [Section 28.3.17, “The INFORMATION\_SCHEMA KEYWORDS Table”](information-schema-keywords-table.md "28.3.17 The INFORMATION_SCHEMA KEYWORDS Table").

### MySQL 8.0 Keywords and Reserved Words

The following list shows the keywords and reserved words in
MySQL 8.0, along with changes to individual words
from version to version. Reserved keywords are marked with (R).
In addition, `_FILENAME` is reserved.

At some point, you might upgrade to a higher version, so it is a
good idea to have a look at future reserved words, too. You can
find these in the manuals that cover higher versions of MySQL.
Most of the reserved words in the list are forbidden by standard
SQL as column or table names (for example,
`GROUP`). A few are reserved because MySQL
needs them and uses a **yacc** parser.
