### 28.3.36 The INFORMATION\_SCHEMA ST\_SPATIAL\_REFERENCE\_SYSTEMS Table

The [`ST_SPATIAL_REFERENCE_SYSTEMS`](information-schema-st-spatial-reference-systems-table.md "28.3.36 The INFORMATION_SCHEMA ST_SPATIAL_REFERENCE_SYSTEMS Table")
table provides information about available spatial reference
systems (SRSs) for spatial data. This table is based on the SQL/MM
(ISO/IEC 13249-3) standard.

Entries in the
[`ST_SPATIAL_REFERENCE_SYSTEMS`](information-schema-st-spatial-reference-systems-table.md "28.3.36 The INFORMATION_SCHEMA ST_SPATIAL_REFERENCE_SYSTEMS Table") table
are based on the [European Petroleum
Survey Group](http://epsg.org) (EPSG) data set, except for SRID 0, which
corresponds to a special SRS used in MySQL that represents an
infinite flat Cartesian plane with no units assigned to its axes.
For additional information about SRSs, see
[Section 13.4.5, “Spatial Reference System Support”](spatial-reference-systems.md "13.4.5 Spatial Reference System Support").

The [`ST_SPATIAL_REFERENCE_SYSTEMS`](information-schema-st-spatial-reference-systems-table.md "28.3.36 The INFORMATION_SCHEMA ST_SPATIAL_REFERENCE_SYSTEMS Table")
table has these columns:

- `SRS_NAME`

  The spatial reference system name. This value is unique.
- `SRS_ID`

  The spatial reference system numeric ID. This value is unique.

  `SRS_ID` values represent the same kind of
  values as the SRID of geometry values or passed as the SRID
  argument to spatial functions. SRID 0 (the unitless Cartesian
  plane) is special. It is always a legal spatial reference
  system ID and can be used in any computations on spatial data
  that depend on SRID values.
- `ORGANIZATION`

  The name of the organization that defined the coordinate
  system on which the spatial reference system is based.
- `ORGANIZATION_COORDSYS_ID`

  The numeric ID given to the spatial reference system by the
  organization that defined it.
- `DEFINITION`

  The spatial reference system definition.
  `DEFINITION` values are WKT values,
  represented as specified in the
  [Open Geospatial
  Consortium](http://www.opengeospatial.org) document
  [OGC
  12-063r5](http://docs.opengeospatial.org/is/12-063r5/12-063r5.html).

  SRS definition parsing occurs on demand when definitions are
  needed by GIS functions. Parsed definitions are stored in the
  data dictionary cache to enable reuse and avoid incurring
  parsing overhead for every statement that needs SRS
  information.
- `DESCRIPTION`

  The spatial reference system description.

#### Notes

- The `SRS_NAME`,
  `ORGANIZATION`,
  `ORGANIZATION_COORDSYS_ID`, and
  `DESCRIPTION` columns contain information
  that may be of interest to users, but they are not used by
  MySQL.

#### Example

```sql
mysql> SELECT * FROM ST_SPATIAL_REFERENCE_SYSTEMS
       WHERE SRS_ID = 4326\G
*************************** 1. row ***************************
                SRS_NAME: WGS 84

             DESCRIPTION:
```

This entry describes the SRS used for GPS systems. It has a name
(`SRS_NAME`) of WGS 84 and an ID
(`SRS_ID`) of 4326, which is the ID used by the
[European Petroleum Survey
Group](http://epsg.org) (EPSG).

The `DEFINITION` values for projected and
geographic SRSs begin with `PROJCS` and
`GEOGCS`, respectively. The definition for SRID 0
is special and has an empty `DEFINITION` value.
The following query determines how many entries in the
[`ST_SPATIAL_REFERENCE_SYSTEMS`](information-schema-st-spatial-reference-systems-table.md "28.3.36 The INFORMATION_SCHEMA ST_SPATIAL_REFERENCE_SYSTEMS Table") table
correspond to projected, geographic, and other SRSs, based on
`DEFINITION` values:

```sql
mysql> SELECT
         COUNT(*),
         CASE LEFT(DEFINITION, 6)
           WHEN 'PROJCS' THEN 'Projected'
           WHEN 'GEOGCS' THEN 'Geographic'
           ELSE 'Other'
         END AS SRS_TYPE
       FROM INFORMATION_SCHEMA.ST_SPATIAL_REFERENCE_SYSTEMS
       GROUP BY SRS_TYPE;
+----------+------------+
| COUNT(*) | SRS_TYPE   |
+----------+------------+
|        1 | Other      |
|     4668 | Projected  |
|      483 | Geographic |
+----------+------------+
```

To enable manipulation of SRS entries stored in the data
dictionary, MySQL provides these SQL statements:

- [`CREATE SPATIAL REFERENCE
  SYSTEM`](create-spatial-reference-system.md "15.1.19 CREATE SPATIAL REFERENCE SYSTEM Statement"): See
  [Section 15.1.19, “CREATE SPATIAL REFERENCE SYSTEM Statement”](create-spatial-reference-system.md "15.1.19 CREATE SPATIAL REFERENCE SYSTEM Statement"). The
  description for this statement includes additional information
  about SRS components.
- [`DROP SPATIAL REFERENCE SYSTEM`](drop-spatial-reference-system.md "15.1.31 DROP SPATIAL REFERENCE SYSTEM Statement"):
  See [Section 15.1.31, “DROP SPATIAL REFERENCE SYSTEM Statement”](drop-spatial-reference-system.md "15.1.31 DROP SPATIAL REFERENCE SYSTEM Statement").
