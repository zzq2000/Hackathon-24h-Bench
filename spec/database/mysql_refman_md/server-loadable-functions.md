## 7.7 MySQL Server Loadable Functions

[7.7.1 Installing and Uninstalling Loadable Functions](function-loading.md)

[7.7.2 Obtaining Information About Loadable Functions](obtaining-loadable-function-information.md)

MySQL supports loadable functions, that is, functions that are not
built in but can be loaded at runtime (either during startup or
later) to extend server capabilities, or unloaded to remove
capabilities. For a table describing the available loadable
functions, see [Section 14.2, “Loadable Function Reference”](loadable-function-reference.md "14.2 Loadable Function Reference").
Loadable functions contrast with built-in (native) functions, which
are implemented as part of the server and are always available; for
a table, see [Section 14.1, “Built-In Function and Operator Reference”](built-in-function-reference.md "14.1 Built-In Function and Operator Reference").

Note

Loadable functions previously were known as user-defined functions
(UDFs). That terminology was something of a misnomer because
“user-defined” also can apply to other types of
functions, such as stored functions (a type of stored object
written using SQL) and native functions added by modifying the
server source code.

MySQL distributions include loadable functions that implement, in
whole or in part, these server capabilities:

- Group Replication enables you to create a highly available
  distributed MySQL service across a group of MySQL server
  instances, with data consistency, conflict detection and
  resolution, and group membership services all built-in. See
  [Chapter 20, *Group Replication*](group-replication.md "Chapter 20 Group Replication").
- MySQL Enterprise Edition includes functions that perform encryption operations
  based on the OpenSSL library. See
  [Section 8.6, “MySQL Enterprise Encryption”](enterprise-encryption.md "8.6 MySQL Enterprise Encryption").
- MySQL Enterprise Edition includes functions that provide an SQL-level API for
  masking and de-identification operations. See
  [MySQL Enterprise Data Masking and De-Identification Elements](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/data-masking-elements.html).
- MySQL Enterprise Edition includes audit logging for monitoring and logging of
  connection and query activity. See [Section 8.4.5, “MySQL Enterprise Audit”](audit-log.md "8.4.5 MySQL Enterprise Audit"),
  and [Section 8.4.6, “The Audit Message Component”](audit-api-message-emit.md "8.4.6 The Audit Message Component").
- MySQL Enterprise Edition includes a firewall capability that implements an
  application-level firewall to enable database administrators to
  permit or deny SQL statement execution based on matching against
  patterns for accepted statement. See [Section 8.4.7, “MySQL Enterprise Firewall”](firewall.md "8.4.7 MySQL Enterprise Firewall").
- A query rewriter examines statements received by MySQL Server
  and possibly rewrites them before the server executes them. See
  [Section 7.6.4, “The Rewriter Query Rewrite Plugin”](rewriter-query-rewrite-plugin.md "7.6.4 The Rewriter Query Rewrite Plugin")
- Version Tokens enables creation of and synchronization around
  server tokens that applications can use to prevent accessing
  incorrect or out-of-date data. See
  [Section 7.6.6, “Version Tokens”](version-tokens.md "7.6.6 Version Tokens").
- The MySQL Keyring provides secure storage for sensitive
  information. See [Section 8.4.4, “The MySQL Keyring”](keyring.md "8.4.4 The MySQL Keyring").
- A locking service provides a locking interface for application
  use. See [Section 7.6.9.1, “The Locking Service”](locking-service.md "7.6.9.1 The Locking Service").
- A function provides access to query attributes. See
  [Section 11.6, “Query Attributes”](query-attributes.md "11.6 Query Attributes").

The following sections describe how to install and uninstall
loadable functions, and how to determine at runtime which loadable
functions are installed and obtain information about them.

In some cases, a loadable function is loaded by installing the
component that implements the function, rather than by loading the
function directly. For details about a particular loadable function,
see the installation instructions for the server feature that
includes it.
