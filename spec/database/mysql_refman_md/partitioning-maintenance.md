### 26.3.4 Maintenance of Partitions

A number of table and partition maintenance tasks can be carried
out on partitioned tables using SQL statements intended for such
purposes.

Table maintenance of partitioned tables can be accomplished
using the statements [`CHECK TABLE`](check-table.md "15.7.3.2 CHECK TABLE Statement"),
[`OPTIMIZE TABLE`](optimize-table.md "15.7.3.4 OPTIMIZE TABLE Statement"),
[`ANALYZE TABLE`](analyze-table.md "15.7.3.1 ANALYZE TABLE Statement"), and
[`REPAIR TABLE`](repair-table.md "15.7.3.5 REPAIR TABLE Statement"), which are supported
for partitioned tables.

You can use a number of extensions to
[`ALTER
TABLE`](alter-table-partition-operations.md "15.1.9.1 ALTER TABLE Partition Operations") for performing operations of this type on one or
more partitions directly, as described in the following list:

- **Rebuilding partitions.**
  Rebuilds the partition; this has the same effect as
  dropping all records stored in the partition, then
  reinserting them. This can be useful for purposes of
  defragmentation.

  Example:

  ```sql
  ALTER TABLE t1 REBUILD PARTITION p0, p1;
  ```
- **Optimizing partitions.**
  If you have deleted a large number of rows from a
  partition or if you have made many changes to a
  partitioned table with variable-length rows (that is,
  having [`VARCHAR`](char.md "13.3.2 The CHAR and VARCHAR Types"),
  [`BLOB`](blob.md "13.3.4 The BLOB and TEXT Types"), or
  [`TEXT`](blob.md "13.3.4 The BLOB and TEXT Types") columns), you can use
  [`ALTER
  TABLE ... OPTIMIZE PARTITION`](alter-table-partition-operations.md "15.1.9.1 ALTER TABLE Partition Operations") to reclaim any
  unused space and to defragment the partition data file.

  Example:

  ```sql
  ALTER TABLE t1 OPTIMIZE PARTITION p0, p1;
  ```

  Using `OPTIMIZE PARTITION` on a given
  partition is equivalent to running `CHECK
  PARTITION`, `ANALYZE PARTITION`,
  and `REPAIR PARTITION` on that partition.

  Some MySQL storage engines, including
  [`InnoDB`](innodb-storage-engine.md "Chapter 17 The InnoDB Storage Engine"), do not support
  per-partition optimization; in these cases,
  [`ALTER
  TABLE ... OPTIMIZE PARTITION`](alter-table-partition-operations.md "15.1.9.1 ALTER TABLE Partition Operations") analyzes and rebuilds
  the entire table, and causes an appropriate warning to be
  issued. (Bug #11751825, Bug #42822) Use `ALTER TABLE
  ... REBUILD PARTITION` and `ALTER TABLE ...
  ANALYZE PARTITION` instead, to avoid this issue.
- **Analyzing partitions.**
  This reads and stores the key distributions for
  partitions.

  Example:

  ```sql
  ALTER TABLE t1 ANALYZE PARTITION p3;
  ```
- **Repairing partitions.**
  This repairs corrupted partitions.

  Example:

  ```sql
  ALTER TABLE t1 REPAIR PARTITION p0,p1;
  ```

  Normally, `REPAIR PARTITION` fails when the
  partition contains duplicate key errors. You can use
  [`ALTER
  IGNORE TABLE`](alter-table-partition-operations.md "15.1.9.1 ALTER TABLE Partition Operations") with this option, in which case all
  rows that cannot be moved due to the presence of duplicate
  keys are removed from the partition (Bug #16900947).
- **Checking partitions.**
  You can check partitions for errors in much the same way
  that you can use `CHECK TABLE` with
  nonpartitioned tables.

  Example:

  ```sql
  ALTER TABLE trb3 CHECK PARTITION p1;
  ```

  This statement tells you whether the data or indexes in
  partition `p1` of table
  `t1` are corrupted. If this is the case,
  use
  [`ALTER
  TABLE ... REPAIR PARTITION`](alter-table-partition-operations.md "15.1.9.1 ALTER TABLE Partition Operations") to repair the
  partition.

  Normally, `CHECK PARTITION` fails when the
  partition contains duplicate key errors. You can use
  [`ALTER
  IGNORE TABLE`](alter-table-partition-operations.md "15.1.9.1 ALTER TABLE Partition Operations") with this option, in which case the
  statement returns the contents of each row in the partition
  where a duplicate key violation is found. Only the values
  for the columns in the partitioning expression for the table
  are reported. (Bug #16900947)

Each of the statements in the list just shown also supports the
keyword `ALL` in place of the list of partition
names. Using `ALL` causes the statement to act
on all partitions in the table.

You can also truncate partitions using
[`ALTER TABLE ...
TRUNCATE PARTITION`](alter-table.md "15.1.9 ALTER TABLE Statement"). This statement can be used to
delete all rows from one or more partitions in much the same way
that [`TRUNCATE TABLE`](truncate-table.md "15.1.37 TRUNCATE TABLE Statement") deletes all
rows from a table.

[`ALTER TABLE ...
TRUNCATE PARTITION ALL`](alter-table.md "15.1.9 ALTER TABLE Statement") truncates all partitions in the
table.
