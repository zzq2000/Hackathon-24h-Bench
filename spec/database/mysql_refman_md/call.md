### 15.2.1 CALL Statement

```sql
CALL sp_name([parameter[,...]])
CALL sp_name[()]
```

The [`CALL`](call.md "15.2.1 CALL Statement") statement invokes a stored
procedure that was defined previously with
[`CREATE PROCEDURE`](create-procedure.md "15.1.17 CREATE PROCEDURE and CREATE FUNCTION Statements").

Stored procedures that take no arguments can be invoked without
parentheses. That is, `CALL p()` and
`CALL p` are equivalent.

[`CALL`](call.md "15.2.1 CALL Statement") can pass back values to its
caller using parameters that are declared as
`OUT` or `INOUT` parameters.
When the procedure returns, a client program can also obtain the
number of rows affected for the final statement executed within
the routine: At the SQL level, call the
[`ROW_COUNT()`](information-functions.md#function_row-count) function; from the C
API, call the
[`mysql_affected_rows()`](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/c-api/8.0/en/mysql-affected-rows.html) function.

For information about the effect of unhandled conditions on
procedure parameters, see
[Section 15.6.7.8, “Condition Handling and OUT or INOUT Parameters”](conditions-and-parameters.md "15.6.7.8 Condition Handling and OUT or INOUT Parameters").

To get back a value from a procedure using an
`OUT` or `INOUT` parameter, pass
the parameter by means of a user variable, and then check the
value of the variable after the procedure returns. (If you are
calling the procedure from within another stored procedure or
function, you can also pass a routine parameter or local routine
variable as an `IN` or `INOUT`
parameter.) For an `INOUT` parameter, initialize
its value before passing it to the procedure. The following
procedure has an `OUT` parameter that the
procedure sets to the current server version, and an
`INOUT` value that the procedure increments by
one from its current value:

```sql
DELIMITER //

CREATE PROCEDURE p (OUT ver_param VARCHAR(25), INOUT incr_param INT)
BEGIN
  # Set value of OUT parameter
  SELECT VERSION() INTO ver_param;
  # Increment value of INOUT parameter
  SET incr_param = incr_param + 1;
END //

DELIMITER ;
```

Before calling the procedure, initialize the variable to be passed
as the `INOUT` parameter. After calling the
procedure, you can see that the values of the two variables are
set or modified:

```sql
mysql> SET @increment = 10;
mysql> CALL p(@version, @increment);
mysql> SELECT @version, @increment;
+----------+------------+
| @version | @increment |
+----------+------------+
| 8.0.45   |         11 |
+----------+------------+
```

In prepared [`CALL`](call.md "15.2.1 CALL Statement") statements used
with [`PREPARE`](prepare.md "15.5.1 PREPARE Statement") and
[`EXECUTE`](execute.md "15.5.2 EXECUTE Statement"), placeholders can be used
for `IN` parameters, `OUT`, and
`INOUT` parameters. These types of parameters can
be used as follows:

```sql
mysql> SET @increment = 10;
mysql> PREPARE s FROM 'CALL p(?, ?)';
mysql> EXECUTE s USING @version, @increment;
mysql> SELECT @version, @increment;
+----------+------------+
| @version | @increment |
+----------+------------+
| 8.0.45   |         11 |
+----------+------------+
```

To write C programs that use the
[`CALL`](call.md "15.2.1 CALL Statement") SQL statement to execute
stored procedures that produce result sets, the
`CLIENT_MULTI_RESULTS` flag must be enabled. This
is because each [`CALL`](call.md "15.2.1 CALL Statement") returns a
result to indicate the call status, in addition to any result sets
that might be returned by statements executed within the
procedure. `CLIENT_MULTI_RESULTS` must also be
enabled if [`CALL`](call.md "15.2.1 CALL Statement") is used to execute
any stored procedure that contains prepared statements. It cannot
be determined when such a procedure is loaded whether those
statements produce result sets, so it is necessary to assume that
they do so.

`CLIENT_MULTI_RESULTS` can be enabled when you
call [`mysql_real_connect()`](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/c-api/8.0/en/mysql-real-connect.html), either
explicitly by passing the `CLIENT_MULTI_RESULTS`
flag itself, or implicitly by passing
`CLIENT_MULTI_STATEMENTS` (which also enables
`CLIENT_MULTI_RESULTS`).
`CLIENT_MULTI_RESULTS` is enabled by default.

To process the result of a [`CALL`](call.md "15.2.1 CALL Statement")
statement executed using
[`mysql_query()`](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/c-api/8.0/en/mysql-query.html) or
[`mysql_real_query()`](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/c-api/8.0/en/mysql-real-query.html), use a loop
that calls [`mysql_next_result()`](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/c-api/8.0/en/mysql-next-result.html) to
determine whether there are more results. For an example, see
[Multiple Statement Execution Support](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/c-api/8.0/en/c-api-multiple-queries.html).

C programs can use the prepared-statement interface to execute
[`CALL`](call.md "15.2.1 CALL Statement") statements and access
`OUT` and `INOUT` parameters.
This is done by processing the result of a
[`CALL`](call.md "15.2.1 CALL Statement") statement using a loop that
calls [`mysql_stmt_next_result()`](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/c-api/8.0/en/mysql-stmt-next-result.html) to
determine whether there are more results. For an example, see
[Prepared CALL Statement Support](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/c-api/8.0/en/c-api-prepared-call-statements.html). Languages that
provide a MySQL interface can use prepared
[`CALL`](call.md "15.2.1 CALL Statement") statements to directly
retrieve `OUT` and `INOUT`
procedure parameters.

Metadata changes to objects referred to by stored programs are
detected and cause automatic reparsing of the affected statements
when the program is next executed. For more information, see
[Section 10.10.3, “Caching of Prepared Statements and Stored Programs”](statement-caching.md "10.10.3 Caching of Prepared Statements and Stored Programs").
