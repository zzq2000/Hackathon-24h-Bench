#### 29.12.6.4 The prepared\_statements\_instances Table

The Performance Schema provides instrumentation for prepared
statements, for which there are two protocols:

- The binary protocol. This is accessed through the MySQL C
  API and maps onto underlying server commands as shown in
  the following table.

  | C API Function | Corresponding Server Command |
  | --- | --- |
  | [`mysql_stmt_prepare()`](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/c-api/8.0/en/mysql-stmt-prepare.html) | `COM_STMT_PREPARE` |
  | [`mysql_stmt_execute()`](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/c-api/8.0/en/mysql-stmt-execute.html) | `COM_STMT_EXECUTE` |
  | [`mysql_stmt_close()`](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/c-api/8.0/en/mysql-stmt-close.html) | `COM_STMT_CLOSE` |
- The text protocol. This is accessed using SQL statements
  and maps onto underlying server commands as shown in the
  following table.

  | SQL Statement | Corresponding Server Command |
  | --- | --- |
  | [`PREPARE`](prepare.md "15.5.1 PREPARE Statement") | `SQLCOM_PREPARE` |
  | [`EXECUTE`](execute.md "15.5.2 EXECUTE Statement") | `SQLCOM_EXECUTE` |
  | [`DEALLOCATE PREPARE`](deallocate-prepare.md "15.5.3 DEALLOCATE PREPARE Statement"), [`DROP PREPARE`](deallocate-prepare.md "15.5.3 DEALLOCATE PREPARE Statement") | `SQLCOM_DEALLOCATE PREPARE` |

Performance Schema prepared statement instrumentation covers
both protocols. The following discussion refers to the server
commands rather than the C API functions or SQL statements.

Information about prepared statements is available in the
[`prepared_statements_instances`](performance-schema-prepared-statements-instances-table.md "29.12.6.4 The prepared_statements_instances Table")
table. This table enables inspection of prepared statements
used in the server and provides aggregated statistics about
them. To control the size of this table, set the
[`performance_schema_max_prepared_statements_instances`](performance-schema-system-variables.md#sysvar_performance_schema_max_prepared_statements_instances)
system variable at server startup.

Collection of prepared statement information depends on the
statement instruments shown in the following table. These
instruments are enabled by default. To modify them, update the
[`setup_instruments`](performance-schema-setup-instruments-table.md "29.12.2.3 The setup_instruments Table") table.

| Instrument | Server Command |
| --- | --- |
| `statement/com/Prepare` | `COM_STMT_PREPARE` |
| `statement/com/Execute` | `COM_STMT_EXECUTE` |
| `statement/sql/prepare_sql` | `SQLCOM_PREPARE` |
| `statement/sql/execute_sql` | `SQLCOM_EXECUTE` |

The Performance Schema manages the contents of the
[`prepared_statements_instances`](performance-schema-prepared-statements-instances-table.md "29.12.6.4 The prepared_statements_instances Table")
table as follows:

- Statement preparation

  A `COM_STMT_PREPARE` or
  `SQLCOM_PREPARE` command creates a
  prepared statement in the server. If the statement is
  successfully instrumented, a new row is added to the
  [`prepared_statements_instances`](performance-schema-prepared-statements-instances-table.md "29.12.6.4 The prepared_statements_instances Table")
  table. If the statement cannot be instrumented,
  [`Performance_schema_prepared_statements_lost`](performance-schema-status-variables.md#statvar_Performance_schema_prepared_statements_lost)
  status variable is incremented.
- Prepared statement execution

  Execution of a `COM_STMT_EXECUTE` or
  `SQLCOM_PREPARE` command for an
  instrumented prepared statement instance updates the
  corresponding
  [`prepared_statements_instances`](performance-schema-prepared-statements-instances-table.md "29.12.6.4 The prepared_statements_instances Table")
  table row.
- Prepared statement deallocation

  Execution of a `COM_STMT_CLOSE` or
  `SQLCOM_DEALLOCATE_PREPARE` command for
  an instrumented prepared statement instance removes the
  corresponding
  [`prepared_statements_instances`](performance-schema-prepared-statements-instances-table.md "29.12.6.4 The prepared_statements_instances Table")
  table row. To avoid resource leaks, removal occurs even if
  the prepared statement instruments described previously
  are disabled.

The [`prepared_statements_instances`](performance-schema-prepared-statements-instances-table.md "29.12.6.4 The prepared_statements_instances Table")
table has these columns:

- `OBJECT_INSTANCE_BEGIN`

  The address in memory of the instrumented prepared
  statement.
- `STATEMENT_ID`

  The internal statement ID assigned by the server. The text
  and binary protocols both use statement IDs.
- `STATEMENT_NAME`

  For the binary protocol, this column is
  `NULL`. For the text protocol, this
  column is the external statement name assigned by the
  user. For example, for the following SQL statement, the
  name of the prepared statement is `stmt`:

  ```sql
  PREPARE stmt FROM 'SELECT 1';
  ```
- `SQL_TEXT`

  The prepared statement text, with `?`
  placeholder markers.
- `OWNER_THREAD_ID`,
  `OWNER_EVENT_ID`

  These columns indicate the event that created the prepared
  statement.
- `OWNER_OBJECT_TYPE`,
  `OWNER_OBJECT_SCHEMA`,
  `OWNER_OBJECT_NAME`

  For a prepared statement created by a client session,
  these columns are `NULL`. For a prepared
  statement created by a stored program, these columns point
  to the stored program. A typical user error is forgetting
  to deallocate prepared statements. These columns can be
  used to find stored programs that leak prepared
  statements:

  ```sql
  SELECT
    OWNER_OBJECT_TYPE, OWNER_OBJECT_SCHEMA, OWNER_OBJECT_NAME,
    STATEMENT_NAME, SQL_TEXT
  FROM performance_schema.prepared_statements_instances
  WHERE OWNER_OBJECT_TYPE IS NOT NULL;
  ```
- The query execution engine. The value is either
  `PRIMARY` or
  `SECONDARY`. For use with MySQL HeatWave Service and
  MySQL HeatWave, where the `PRIMARY` engine is
  `InnoDB` and the
  `SECONDARY` engine is MySQL HeatWave
  (`RAPID`). For MySQL Community Edition Server, MySQL Enterprise Edition Server
  (on-premise), and MySQL HeatWave Service without MySQL HeatWave, the value is
  always `PRIMARY`. This column was added
  in MySQL 8.0.29.
- `TIMER_PREPARE`

  The time spent executing the statement preparation itself.
- `COUNT_REPREPARE`

  The number of times the statement was reprepared
  internally (see [Section 10.10.3, “Caching of Prepared Statements and Stored Programs”](statement-caching.md "10.10.3 Caching of Prepared Statements and Stored Programs")).
  Timing statistics for repreparation are not available
  because it is counted as part of statement execution, not
  as a separate operation.
- `COUNT_EXECUTE`,
  `SUM_TIMER_EXECUTE`,
  `MIN_TIMER_EXECUTE`,
  `AVG_TIMER_EXECUTE`,
  `MAX_TIMER_EXECUTE`

  Aggregated statistics for executions of the prepared
  statement.
- `SUM_xxx`

  The remaining
  `SUM_xxx`
  columns are the same as for the statement summary tables
  (see
  [Section 29.12.20.3, “Statement Summary Tables”](performance-schema-statement-summary-tables.md "29.12.20.3 Statement Summary Tables")).
- `MAX_CONTROLLED_MEMORY`

  Reports the maximum amount of controlled memory used by a
  prepared statement during execution.

  This column was added in MySQL 8.0.31.
- `MAX_TOTAL_MEMORY`

  Reports the maximum amount of memory used by a prepared
  statement during execution.

  This column was added in MySQL 8.0.31.

The [`prepared_statements_instances`](performance-schema-prepared-statements-instances-table.md "29.12.6.4 The prepared_statements_instances Table")
table has these indexes:

- Primary key on (`OBJECT_INSTANCE_BEGIN`)
- Index on (`STATEMENT_ID`)
- Index on (`STATEMENT_NAME`)
- Index on (`OWNER_THREAD_ID`,
  `OWNER_EVENT_ID`)
- Index on (`OWNER_OBJECT_TYPE`,
  `OWNER_OBJECT_SCHEMA`,
  `OWNER_OBJECT_NAME`)

[`TRUNCATE TABLE`](truncate-table.md "15.1.37 TRUNCATE TABLE Statement") resets the
statistics columns of the
[`prepared_statements_instances`](performance-schema-prepared-statements-instances-table.md "29.12.6.4 The prepared_statements_instances Table")
table.
