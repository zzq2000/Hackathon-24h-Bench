#### 22.3.3.6 Create and Drop Indexes

Indexes are used to find documents with specific field values
quickly. Without an index, MySQL must begin with the first
document and then read through the entire collection to find the
relevant fields. The larger the collection, the more this costs.
If a collection is large and queries on a specific field are
common, then consider creating an index on a specific field
inside a document.

For example, the following query performs better with an index
on the Population field:

```mysqlsh
mysql-js> db.countryinfo.find("demographics.Population < 100")
...[output removed]
8 documents in set (0.00 sec)
```

The `createIndex()` method creates an index
that you can define with a JSON document that specifies which
fields to use. This section is a high level overview of
indexing. For more information see
[Indexing Collections](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/x-devapi-userguide/en/collection-indexing.html).

##### Add a Nonunique Index

To create a nonunique index, pass an index name and the index
information to the `createIndex()` method.
Duplicate index names are prohibited.

The following example specifies an index named
`popul`, defined against the
`Population` field from the
`demographics` object, indexed as an
`Integer` numeric value. The final parameter
indicates whether the field should require the `NOT
NULL` constraint. If the value is
`false`, the field can contain
`NULL` values. The index information is a
JSON document with details of one or more fields to include in
the index. Each field definition must include the full
document path to the field, and specify the type of the field.

```mysqlsh
mysql-js> db.countryinfo.createIndex("popul", {fields:
[{field: '$.demographics.Population', type: 'INTEGER'}]})
```

Here, the index is created using an integer numeric value.
Further options are available, including options for use with
GeoJSON data. You can also specify the type of index, which
has been omitted here because the default type
“index” is appropriate.

##### Add a Unique Index

To create a unique index, pass an index name, the index
definition, and the index type “unique” to the
`createIndex()` method. This example shows a
unique index created on the country name
(`"Name"`), which is another common field in
the `countryinfo` collection to index. In the
index field description, `"TEXT(40)"`
represents the number of characters to index, and
`"required": True` specifies that the field
is required to exist in the document.

```mysqlsh
mysql-js> db.countryinfo.createIndex("name",
{"fields": [{"field": "$.Name", "type": "TEXT(40)", "required": true}], "unique": true})
```

##### Drop an Index

To drop an index, pass the name of the index to drop to the
`dropIndex()` method. For example, you can
drop the “popul” index as follows:

```mysqlsh
mysql-js> db.countryinfo.dropIndex("popul")
```
