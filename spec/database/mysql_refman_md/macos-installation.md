For a list of macOS versions that the MySQL server supports, see
<https://www.mysql.com/support/supportedplatforms/database.html>.

MySQL for macOS is available in a number of different forms:

- Native Package Installer, which uses the native macOS installer
  (DMG) to walk you through the installation of MySQL. For more
  information, see [Section 2.4.2, “Installing MySQL on macOS Using Native Packages”](macos-installation-pkg.md "2.4.2 Installing MySQL on macOS Using Native Packages"). You
  can use the package installer with macOS. The user you use to
  perform the installation must have administrator privileges.
- Compressed TAR archive, which uses a file packaged using the
  Unix **tar** and **gzip**
  commands. To use this method, you need to open a
  **Terminal** window. You do not need
  administrator privileges using this method; you can install the
  MySQL server anywhere using this method. For more information on
  using this method, you can use the generic instructions for
  using a tarball, [Section 2.2, “Installing MySQL on Unix/Linux Using Generic Binaries”](binary-installation.md "2.2 Installing MySQL on Unix/Linux Using Generic Binaries").

  In addition to the core installation, the Package Installer also
  includes [Section 2.4.3, “Installing and Using the MySQL Launch Daemon”](macos-installation-launchd.md "2.4.3 Installing and Using the MySQL Launch Daemon") and
  [Section 2.4.4, “Installing and Using the MySQL Preference Pane”](macos-installation-prefpane.md "2.4.4 Installing and Using the MySQL Preference Pane") to simplify the
  management of your installation.
