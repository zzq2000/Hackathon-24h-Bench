#### 25.6.16.29 The ndbinfo disk\_write\_speed\_aggregate\_node Table

The `disk_write_speed_aggregate_node` table
provides aggregated information per node about the speed of disk
writes during LCP, backup, and restore operations.

The `disk_write_speed_aggregate_node` table
contains the following columns:

- `node_id`

  Node ID of this node
- `backup_lcp_speed_last_sec`

  Number of bytes written to disk by backup and LCP processes
  in the last second
- `redo_speed_last_sec`

  Number of bytes written to the redo log in the last second
- `backup_lcp_speed_last_10sec`

  Number of bytes written to disk by backup and LCP processes
  per second, averaged over the last 10 seconds
- `redo_speed_last_10sec`

  Number of bytes written to the redo log each second,
  averaged over the last 10 seconds
- `backup_lcp_speed_last_60sec`

  Number of bytes written to disk by backup and LCP processes
  per second, averaged over the last 60 seconds
- `redo_speed_last_60sec`

  Number of bytes written to the redo log each second,
  averaged over the last 60 seconds
