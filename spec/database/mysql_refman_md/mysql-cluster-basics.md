### 25.2.1 NDB Cluster Core Concepts

[`NDBCLUSTER`](mysql-cluster.md "Chapter 25 MySQL NDB Cluster 8.0")
(also known as [`NDB`](mysql-cluster.md "Chapter 25 MySQL NDB Cluster 8.0")) is an in-memory
storage engine offering high-availability and data-persistence
features.

The [`NDBCLUSTER`](mysql-cluster.md "Chapter 25 MySQL NDB Cluster 8.0") storage engine can be
configured with a range of failover and load-balancing options,
but it is easiest to start with the storage engine at the cluster
level. NDB Cluster's [`NDB`](mysql-cluster.md "Chapter 25 MySQL NDB Cluster 8.0") storage
engine contains a complete set of data, dependent only on other
data within the cluster itself.

The “Cluster” portion of NDB Cluster is configured
independently of the MySQL servers. In an NDB Cluster, each part
of the cluster is considered to be a
node.

Note

In many contexts, the term “node” is used to
indicate a computer, but when discussing NDB Cluster it means a
*process*. It is possible to run multiple
nodes on a single computer; for a computer on which one or more
cluster nodes are being run we use the term
cluster host.

There are three types of cluster nodes, and in a minimal NDB
Cluster configuration, there are at least three nodes, one of each
of these types:

- Management node: The
  role of this type of node is to manage the other nodes within
  the NDB Cluster, performing such functions as providing
  configuration data, starting and stopping nodes, and running
  backups. Because this node type manages the configuration of
  the other nodes, a node of this type should be started first,
  before any other node. A management node is started with the
  command [**ndb\_mgmd**](mysql-cluster-programs-ndb-mgmd.md "25.5.4 ndb_mgmd — The NDB Cluster Management Server Daemon").
- Data node: This type of
  node stores cluster data. There are as many data nodes as
  there are fragment replicas, times the number of fragments
  (see [Section 25.2.2, “NDB Cluster Nodes, Node Groups, Fragment Replicas, and Partitions”](mysql-cluster-nodes-groups.md "25.2.2 NDB Cluster Nodes, Node Groups, Fragment Replicas, and Partitions")). For
  example, with two fragment replicas, each having two
  fragments, you need four data nodes. One fragment replica is
  sufficient for data storage, but provides no redundancy;
  therefore, it is recommended to have two (or more) fragment
  replicas to provide redundancy, and thus high availability. A
  data node is started with the command [**ndbd**](mysql-cluster-programs-ndbd.md "25.5.1 ndbd — The NDB Cluster Data Node Daemon")
  (see [Section 25.5.1, “ndbd — The NDB Cluster Data Node Daemon”](mysql-cluster-programs-ndbd.md "25.5.1 ndbd — The NDB Cluster Data Node Daemon")) or
  [**ndbmtd**](mysql-cluster-programs-ndbmtd.md "25.5.3 ndbmtd — The NDB Cluster Data Node Daemon (Multi-Threaded)") (see
  [Section 25.5.3, “ndbmtd — The NDB Cluster Data Node Daemon (Multi-Threaded)”](mysql-cluster-programs-ndbmtd.md "25.5.3 ndbmtd — The NDB Cluster Data Node Daemon (Multi-Threaded)")).

  NDB Cluster tables are normally stored completely in memory
  rather than on disk (this is why we refer to NDB Cluster as an
  in-memory database).
  However, some NDB Cluster data can be stored on disk; see
  [Section 25.6.11, “NDB Cluster Disk Data Tables”](mysql-cluster-disk-data.md "25.6.11 NDB Cluster Disk Data Tables"), for more
  information.
- SQL node: This is a node
  that accesses the cluster data. In the case of NDB Cluster, an
  SQL node is a traditional MySQL server that uses the
  [`NDBCLUSTER`](mysql-cluster.md "Chapter 25 MySQL NDB Cluster 8.0") storage engine. An SQL
  node is a [**mysqld**](mysqld.md "6.3.1 mysqld — The MySQL Server") process started with the
  [`--ndbcluster`](mysql-cluster-options-variables.md#option_mysqld_ndbcluster) and
  `--ndb-connectstring` options, which are
  explained elsewhere in this chapter, possibly with additional
  MySQL server options as well.

  An SQL node is actually just a specialized type of
  API node, which
  designates any application which accesses NDB Cluster data.
  Another example of an API node is the
  [**ndb\_restore**](mysql-cluster-programs-ndb-restore.md "25.5.23 ndb_restore — Restore an NDB Cluster Backup") utility that is used to restore
  a cluster backup. It is possible to write such applications
  using the NDB API. For basic information about the NDB API,
  see [Getting Started with the NDB API](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/ndbapi/en/ndb-getting-started.html).

Important

It is not realistic to expect to employ a three-node setup in a
production environment. Such a configuration provides no
redundancy; to benefit from NDB Cluster's high-availability
features, you must use multiple data and SQL nodes. The use of
multiple management nodes is also highly recommended.

For a brief introduction to the relationships between nodes, node
groups, fragment replicas, and partitions in NDB Cluster, see
[Section 25.2.2, “NDB Cluster Nodes, Node Groups, Fragment Replicas, and Partitions”](mysql-cluster-nodes-groups.md "25.2.2 NDB Cluster Nodes, Node Groups, Fragment Replicas, and Partitions").

Configuration of a cluster involves configuring each individual
node in the cluster and setting up individual communication links
between nodes. NDB Cluster is currently designed with the
intention that data nodes are homogeneous in terms of processor
power, memory space, and bandwidth. In addition, to provide a
single point of configuration, all configuration data for the
cluster as a whole is located in one configuration file.

The management server manages the cluster configuration file and
the cluster log. Each node in the cluster retrieves the
configuration data from the management server, and so requires a
way to determine where the management server resides. When
interesting events occur in the data nodes, the nodes transfer
information about these events to the management server, which
then writes the information to the cluster log.

In addition, there can be any number of cluster client processes
or applications. These include standard MySQL clients,
`NDB`-specific API programs, and management
clients. These are described in the next few paragraphs.

**Standard MySQL clients.**
NDB Cluster can be used with existing MySQL applications written
in PHP, Perl, C, C++, Java, Python, and so on. Such client
applications send SQL statements to and receive responses from
MySQL servers acting as NDB Cluster SQL nodes in much the same
way that they interact with standalone MySQL servers.

MySQL clients using an NDB Cluster as a data source can be
modified to take advantage of the ability to connect with multiple
MySQL servers to achieve load balancing and failover. For example,
Java clients using Connector/J 5.0.6 and later can use
`jdbc:mysql:loadbalance://` URLs (improved in
Connector/J 5.1.7) to achieve load balancing transparently; for
more information about using Connector/J with NDB Cluster, see
[Using Connector/J with NDB Cluster](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/ndbapi/en/mccj-using-connectorj.html).

**NDB client programs.**
Client programs can be written that access NDB Cluster data
directly from the `NDBCLUSTER` storage engine,
bypassing any MySQL Servers that may be connected to the
cluster, using the NDB
API, a high-level C++ API. Such applications may be
useful for specialized purposes where an SQL interface to the
data is not needed. For more information, see
[The NDB API](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/ndbapi/en/ndbapi.html).

`NDB`-specific Java applications can also be
written for NDB Cluster using the NDB
Cluster Connector for Java. This NDB Cluster Connector
includes ClusterJ, a
high-level database API similar to object-relational mapping
persistence frameworks such as Hibernate and JPA that connect
directly to `NDBCLUSTER`, and so does not require
access to a MySQL Server. See
[Java and NDB Cluster](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/ndbapi/en/mccj-overview-java.html), and
[The ClusterJ API and Data Object Model](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/ndbapi/en/mccj-overview-clusterj-object-models.html), for more
information.

NDB Cluster also supports applications written in JavaScript using
Node.js. The MySQL Connector for JavaScript includes adapters for
direct access to the `NDB` storage engine and as
well as for the MySQL Server. Applications using this Connector
are typically event-driven and use a domain object model similar
in many ways to that employed by ClusterJ. For more information,
see [MySQL NoSQL Connector for JavaScript](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/ndbapi/en/ndb-nodejs.html).

**Management clients.**
These clients connect to the management server and provide
commands for starting and stopping nodes gracefully, starting
and stopping message tracing (debug versions only), showing node
versions and status, starting and stopping backups, and so on.
An example of this type of program is the
[**ndb\_mgm**](mysql-cluster-programs-ndb-mgm.md "25.5.5 ndb_mgm — The NDB Cluster Management Client") management client supplied with NDB
Cluster (see [Section 25.5.5, “ndb\_mgm — The NDB Cluster Management Client”](mysql-cluster-programs-ndb-mgm.md "25.5.5 ndb_mgm — The NDB Cluster Management Client")).
Such applications can be written using the
MGM API, a C-language API
that communicates directly with one or more NDB Cluster
management servers. For more information, see
[The MGM API](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/ndbapi/en/mgm-api.html).

Oracle also makes available MySQL Cluster Manager, which provides an advanced
command-line interface simplifying many complex NDB Cluster
management tasks, such restarting an NDB Cluster with a large
number of nodes. The MySQL Cluster Manager client also supports commands for
getting and setting the values of most node configuration
parameters as well as [**mysqld**](mysqld.md "6.3.1 mysqld — The MySQL Server") server options and
variables relating to NDB Cluster. MySQL Cluster Manager 8.0 provides support for
NDB 8.0. See [MySQL Cluster Manager 8.0.43 User Manual](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/mysql-cluster-manager/8.0/en/), for more information.

**Event logs.**
NDB Cluster logs events by category (startup, shutdown, errors,
checkpoints, and so on), priority, and severity. A complete
listing of all reportable events may be found in
[Section 25.6.3, “Event Reports Generated in NDB Cluster”](mysql-cluster-event-reports.md "25.6.3 Event Reports Generated in NDB Cluster"). Event logs are of
the two types listed here:

- Cluster log: Keeps a
  record of all desired reportable events for the cluster as a
  whole.
- Node log: A separate log
  which is also kept for each individual node.

Note

Under normal circumstances, it is necessary and sufficient to
keep and examine only the cluster log. The node logs need be
consulted only for application development and debugging
purposes.

**Checkpoint.**
Generally speaking, when data is saved to disk, it is said that
a checkpoint has been
reached. More specific to NDB Cluster, a checkpoint is a point
in time where all committed transactions are stored on disk.
With regard to the [`NDB`](mysql-cluster.md "Chapter 25 MySQL NDB Cluster 8.0") storage
engine, there are two types of checkpoints which work together
to ensure that a consistent view of the cluster's data is
maintained. These are shown in the following list:

- Local Checkpoint (LCP):
  This is a checkpoint that is specific to a single node;
  however, LCPs take place for all nodes in the cluster more or
  less concurrently. An LCP usually occurs every few minutes;
  the precise interval varies, and depends upon the amount of
  data stored by the node, the level of cluster activity, and
  other factors.

  NDB 8.0 supports partial LCPs, which can
  significantly improve performance under some conditions. See
  the descriptions of the
  [`EnablePartialLcp`](mysql-cluster-ndbd-definition.md#ndbparam-ndbd-enablepartiallcp) and
  [`RecoveryWork`](mysql-cluster-ndbd-definition.md#ndbparam-ndbd-recoverywork)
  configuration parameters which enable partial LCPs and control
  the amount of storage they use.
- Global Checkpoint (GCP):
  A GCP occurs every few seconds, when transactions for all
  nodes are synchronized and the redo-log is flushed to disk.

For more information about the files and directories created by
local checkpoints and global checkpoints, see
[NDB Cluster Data Node File System Directory](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/ndb-internals/en/ndb-internals-ndbd-filesystemdir-files.html).

**Transporter.**
We use the term
transporter for the data
transport mechanism employed between data nodes. MySQL NDB
Cluster 8.0 supports three of these, which are
listed here:

- *TCP/IP over Ethernet*. See
  [Section 25.4.3.10, “NDB Cluster TCP/IP Connections”](mysql-cluster-tcp-definition.md "25.4.3.10 NDB Cluster TCP/IP Connections").
- *Direct TCP/IP*. Uses machine-to-machine
  connections. See
  [Section 25.4.3.11, “NDB Cluster TCP/IP Connections Using Direct Connections”](mysql-cluster-tcp-definition-direct.md "25.4.3.11 NDB Cluster TCP/IP Connections Using Direct Connections").

  Although this transporter uses the same TCP/IP protocol as
  mentioned in the previous item, it requires setting up the
  hardware differently and is configured differently as well.
  For this reason, it is considered a separate transport
  mechanism for NDB Cluster.
- *Shared memory (SHM)*. See
  [Section 25.4.3.12, “NDB Cluster Shared-Memory Connections”](mysql-cluster-shm-definition.md "25.4.3.12 NDB Cluster Shared-Memory Connections").

Because it is ubiquitous, most users employ TCP/IP over Ethernet
for NDB Cluster.

Regardless of the transporter used, `NDB`
attempts to make sure that communication between data node
processes is performed using chunks that are as large as possible
since this benefits all types of data transmission.
