#### 19.3.3.1 Privileges For The Replication PRIVILEGE\_CHECKS\_USER Account

The user account that is specified using the
[`CHANGE REPLICATION SOURCE TO`](change-replication-source-to.md "15.4.2.3 CHANGE REPLICATION SOURCE TO Statement") |
[`CHANGE MASTER TO`](change-master-to.md "15.4.2.1 CHANGE MASTER TO Statement") statement as the
`PRIVILEGE_CHECKS_USER` account for a
replication channel must have the
[`REPLICATION_APPLIER`](privileges-provided.md#priv_replication-applier) privilege,
otherwise the replication applier thread does not start. As
explained in [Section 19.3.3, “Replication Privilege Checks”](replication-privilege-checks.md "19.3.3 Replication Privilege Checks"), the
account requires further privileges that are sufficient to apply
all the expected transactions expected on the replication
channel. These privileges are checked only when relevant
transactions are executed.

The use of row-based binary logging
([`binlog_format=ROW`](replication-options-binary-log.md#sysvar_binlog_format)) is strongly
recommended for replication channels that are secured using a
`PRIVILEGE_CHECKS_USER` account. With
statement-based binary logging, some administrator-level
privileges might be required for the
`PRIVILEGE_CHECKS_USER` account to execute
transactions successfully. From MySQL 8.0.19, the
`REQUIRE_ROW_FORMAT` setting can be applied to
secured channels, which restricts the channel from executing
events that would require these privileges.

The [`REPLICATION_APPLIER`](privileges-provided.md#priv_replication-applier) privilege
explicitly or implicitly allows the
`PRIVILEGE_CHECKS_USER` account to carry out
the following operations that a replication thread needs to
perform:

- Setting the value of the system variables
  [`gtid_next`](replication-options-gtids.md#sysvar_gtid_next),
  [`original_commit_timestamp`](replication-options-binary-log.md#sysvar_original_commit_timestamp),
  [`original_server_version`](replication-options-source.md#sysvar_original_server_version),
  [`immediate_server_version`](replication-options-source.md#sysvar_immediate_server_version),
  and [`pseudo_replica_mode`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_pseudo_replica_mode) or
  [`pseudo_slave_mode`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_pseudo_slave_mode), to apply
  appropriate metadata and behaviors when executing
  transactions.
- Executing internal-use [`BINLOG`](binlog.md "15.7.8.1 BINLOG Statement")
  statements to apply [**mysqlbinlog**](mysqlbinlog.md "6.6.9 mysqlbinlog — Utility for Processing Binary Log Files") output,
  provided that the account also has permission for the tables
  and operations in those statements.
- Updating the system tables
  `mysql.gtid_executed`,
  `mysql.slave_relay_log_info`,
  `mysql.slave_worker_info`, and
  `mysql.slave_master_info`, to update
  replication metadata. (If events access these tables
  explicitly for other purposes, you must grant the
  appropriate privileges on the tables.)
- Applying a binary log
  `Table_map_log_event`, which provides table
  metadata but does not make any database changes.

If the `REQUIRE_TABLE_PRIMARY_KEY_CHECK` option
of the [`CHANGE REPLICATION SOURCE
TO`](change-replication-source-to.md "15.4.2.3 CHANGE REPLICATION SOURCE TO Statement") | [`CHANGE MASTER TO`](change-master-to.md "15.4.2.1 CHANGE MASTER TO Statement")
statement is set to the default of `STREAM`,
the `PRIVILEGE_CHECKS_USER` account needs
privileges sufficient to set restricted session variables, so
that it can change the value of the
[`sql_require_primary_key`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_sql_require_primary_key) system
variable for the duration of a session to match the setting
replicated from the source. The
[`SESSION_VARIABLES_ADMIN`](privileges-provided.md#priv_session-variables-admin) privilege
gives the account this capability. This privilege also allows
the account to apply [**mysqlbinlog**](mysqlbinlog.md "6.6.9 mysqlbinlog — Utility for Processing Binary Log Files") output that
was created using the
[`--disable-log-bin`](mysqlbinlog.md#option_mysqlbinlog_disable-log-bin) option. If
you set `REQUIRE_TABLE_PRIMARY_KEY_CHECK` to
either `ON` or `OFF`, the
replica always uses that value for the
[`sql_require_primary_key`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_sql_require_primary_key) system
variable in replication operations, and so does not need these
session administration level privileges.

If table encryption is in use, the
[`table_encryption_privilege_check`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_table_encryption_privilege_check)
system variable is set to `ON`, and the
encryption setting for the tablespace involved in any event
differs from the applying server's default encryption setting
(specified by the
[`default_table_encryption`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_default_table_encryption) system
variable), the `PRIVILEGE_CHECKS_USER` account
needs the [`TABLE_ENCRYPTION_ADMIN`](privileges-provided.md#priv_table-encryption-admin)
privilege in order to override the default encryption setting.
It is strongly recommended that you do not grant this privilege.
Instead, ensure that the default encryption setting on a replica
matches the encryption status of the tablespaces that it
replicates, and that replication group members have the same
default encryption setting, so that the privilege is not needed.

In order to execute specific replicated transactions from the
relay log, or transactions from [**mysqlbinlog**](mysqlbinlog.md "6.6.9 mysqlbinlog — Utility for Processing Binary Log Files")
output as required, the `PRIVILEGE_CHECKS_USER`
account must have the following privileges:

- For a row insertion logged in row format (which are logged
  as a `Write_rows_log_event`), the
  [`INSERT`](privileges-provided.md#priv_insert) privilege on the
  relevant table.
- For a row update logged in row format (which are logged as
  an `Update_rows_log_event`), the
  [`UPDATE`](privileges-provided.md#priv_update) privilege on the
  relevant table.
- For a row deletion logged in row format (which are logged as
  a `Delete_rows_log_event`), the
  [`DELETE`](privileges-provided.md#priv_delete) privilege on the
  relevant table.

If statement-based binary logging is in use (which is not
recommended with a `PRIVILEGE_CHECKS_USER`
account), for a transaction control statement such as
`BEGIN` or `COMMIT` or DML
logged in statement format (which are logged as a
`Query_log_event`), the
`PRIVILEGE_CHECKS_USER` account needs
privileges to execute the statement contained in the event.

If [`LOAD DATA`](load-data.md "15.2.9 LOAD DATA Statement") operations need to
be carried out on the replication channel, use row-based binary
logging ([`binlog_format=ROW`](replication-options-binary-log.md#sysvar_binlog_format)).
With this logging format, the
[`FILE`](privileges-provided.md#priv_file) privilege is not needed to
execute the event, so do not give the
`PRIVILEGE_CHECKS_USER` account this privilege.
The use of row-based binary logging is strongly recommended with
replication channels that are secured using a
`PRIVILEGE_CHECKS_USER` account. If
`REQUIRE_ROW_FORMAT` is set for the channel,
row-based binary logging is required. The
`Format_description_log_event`, which deletes
any temporary files created by [`LOAD
DATA`](load-data.md "15.2.9 LOAD DATA Statement") events, is processed without privilege checks.
For more information, see
[Section 19.5.1.19, “Replication and LOAD DATA”](replication-features-load-data.md "19.5.1.19 Replication and LOAD DATA").

If the [`init_replica`](replication-options-replica.md#sysvar_init_replica) or
[`init_slave`](replication-options-replica.md#sysvar_init_slave) system variable is
set to specify one or more SQL statements to be executed when
the replication SQL thread starts, the
`PRIVILEGE_CHECKS_USER` account must have the
privileges needed to execute these statements.

It is recommended that you never give any ACL privileges to the
`PRIVILEGE_CHECKS_USER` account, including
[`CREATE USER`](privileges-provided.md#priv_create-user),
[`CREATE ROLE`](privileges-provided.md#priv_create-role),
[`DROP ROLE`](privileges-provided.md#priv_drop-role), and
[`GRANT OPTION`](privileges-provided.md#priv_grant-option), and do not permit
the account to update the `mysql.user` table.
With these privileges, the account could be used to create or
modify user accounts on the server. To avoid ACL statements
issued on the source server being replicated to the secured
channel for execution (where they fail in the absence of these
privileges), you can issue `SET sql_log_bin =
0` before all ACL statements and `SET
sql_log_bin = 1` after them, to omit the statements
from the source's binary log. Alternatively, you can set a
dedicated current database before executing all ACL statements,
and use a replication filter
([`--binlog-ignore-db`](replication-options-binary-log.md#option_mysqld_binlog-ignore-db)) to filter
out this database on the replica.
