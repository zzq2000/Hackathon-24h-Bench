#### 15.6.6.2 Cursor DECLARE Statement

```sql
DECLARE cursor_name CURSOR FOR select_statement
```

This statement declares a cursor and associates it with a
[`SELECT`](select.md "15.2.13 SELECT Statement") statement that retrieves
the rows to be traversed by the cursor. To fetch the rows later,
use a [`FETCH`](fetch.md "15.6.6.3 Cursor FETCH Statement") statement. The number
of columns retrieved by the
[`SELECT`](select.md "15.2.13 SELECT Statement") statement must match the
number of output variables specified in the
[`FETCH`](fetch.md "15.6.6.3 Cursor FETCH Statement") statement.

The [`SELECT`](select.md "15.2.13 SELECT Statement") statement cannot have
an `INTO` clause.

Cursor declarations must appear before handler declarations and
after variable and condition declarations.

A stored program may contain multiple cursor declarations, but
each cursor declared in a given block must have a unique name.
For an example, see [Section 15.6.6, “Cursors”](cursors.md "15.6.6 Cursors").

For information available through
[`SHOW`](show.md "15.7.7 SHOW Statements") statements, it is possible
in many cases to obtain equivalent information by using a cursor
with an `INFORMATION_SCHEMA` table.
