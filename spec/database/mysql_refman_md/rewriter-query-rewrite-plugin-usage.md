#### 7.6.4.2 Using the Rewriter Query Rewrite Plugin

To enable or disable the plugin, enable or disable the
[`rewriter_enabled`](rewriter-query-rewrite-plugin-reference.md#sysvar_rewriter_enabled) system
variable. By default, the `Rewriter` plugin is
enabled when you install it (see
[Section 7.6.4.1, “Installing or Uninstalling the Rewriter Query Rewrite Plugin”](rewriter-query-rewrite-plugin-installation.md "7.6.4.1 Installing or Uninstalling the Rewriter Query Rewrite Plugin")).
To set the initial plugin state explicitly, you can set the
variable at server startup. For example, to enable the plugin in
an option file, use these lines:

```ini
[mysqld]
rewriter_enabled=ON
```

It is also possible to enable or disable the plugin at runtime:

```sql
SET GLOBAL rewriter_enabled = ON;
SET GLOBAL rewriter_enabled = OFF;
```

Assuming that the `Rewriter` plugin is enabled,
it examines and possibly modifies each rewritable statement
received by the server. The plugin determines whether to rewrite
statements based on its in-memory cache of rewriting rules,
which are loaded from the `rewrite_rules` table
in the `query_rewrite` database.

These statements are subject to rewriting:

- As of MySQL 8.0.12: [`SELECT`](select.md "15.2.13 SELECT Statement"),
  [`INSERT`](insert.md "15.2.7 INSERT Statement"),
  [`REPLACE`](replace.md "15.2.12 REPLACE Statement"),
  [`UPDATE`](update.md "15.2.17 UPDATE Statement"), and
  [`DELETE`](delete.md "15.2.2 DELETE Statement").
- Prior to MySQL 8.0.12: [`SELECT`](select.md "15.2.13 SELECT Statement")
  only.

Standalone statements and prepared statements are subject to
rewriting. Statements occurring within view definitions or
stored programs are not subject to rewriting.

Beginning with MySQL 8.0.31, statements run by users with the
[`SKIP_QUERY_REWRITE`](privileges-provided.md#priv_skip-query-rewrite) privilege are
not subject to rewriting, provided that the
[`rewriter_enabled_for_threads_without_privilege_checks`](rewriter-query-rewrite-plugin-reference.md#sysvar_rewriter_enabled_for_threads_without_privilege_checks)
system variable is set to `OFF` (default
`ON`). This can be used for control statements
and statements that should be replicated unchanged, such as
those from the `SOURCE_USER` specified by
[`CHANGE REPLICATION SOURCE TO`](change-replication-source-to.md "15.4.2.3 CHANGE REPLICATION SOURCE TO Statement").
This is also true for statements executed by MySQL client
programs including [**mysqlbinlog**](mysqlbinlog.md "6.6.9 mysqlbinlog — Utility for Processing Binary Log Files"),
[**mysqladmin**](mysqladmin.md "6.5.2 mysqladmin — A MySQL Server Administration Program"), [**mysqldump**](mysqldump.md "6.5.4 mysqldump — A Database Backup Program"), and
[**mysqlpump**](mysqlpump.md "6.5.6 mysqlpump — A Database Backup Program"); for this reason, you should grant
`SKIP_QUERY_REWRITE` to the user account or
accounts used by these utilities to connect to MySQL.

##### Adding Rewrite Rules

To add rules for the `Rewriter` plugin, add
rows to the `rewrite_rules` table, then
invoke the `flush_rewrite_rules()` stored
procedure to load the rules from the table into the plugin.
The following example creates a simple rule to match
statements that select a single literal value:

```sql
INSERT INTO query_rewrite.rewrite_rules (pattern, replacement)
VALUES('SELECT ?', 'SELECT ? + 1');
```

The resulting table contents look like this:

```sql
mysql> SELECT * FROM query_rewrite.rewrite_rules\G
*************************** 1. row ***************************
                id: 1
           pattern: SELECT ?
  pattern_database: NULL
       replacement: SELECT ? + 1
           enabled: YES
           message: NULL
    pattern_digest: NULL
normalized_pattern: NULL
```

The rule specifies a pattern template indicating which
[`SELECT`](select.md "15.2.13 SELECT Statement") statements to match, and
a replacement template indicating how to rewrite matching
statements. However, adding the rule to the
`rewrite_rules` table is not sufficient to
cause the `Rewriter` plugin to use the rule.
You must invoke `flush_rewrite_rules()` to
load the table contents into the plugin in-memory cache:

```sql
mysql> CALL query_rewrite.flush_rewrite_rules();
```

Tip

If your rewrite rules seem not to be working properly, make
sure that you have reloaded the rules table by calling
`flush_rewrite_rules()`.

When the plugin reads each rule from the rules table, it
computes a normalized (statement digest) form from the pattern
and a digest hash value, and uses them to update the
`normalized_pattern` and
`pattern_digest` columns:

```sql
mysql> SELECT * FROM query_rewrite.rewrite_rules\G
*************************** 1. row ***************************
                id: 1
           pattern: SELECT ?
  pattern_database: NULL
       replacement: SELECT ? + 1
           enabled: YES
           message: NULL
    pattern_digest: d1b44b0c19af710b5a679907e284acd2ddc285201794bc69a2389d77baedddae
normalized_pattern: select ?
```

For information about statement digesting, normalized
statements, and digest hash values, see
[Section 29.10, “Performance Schema Statement Digests and Sampling”](performance-schema-statement-digests.md "29.10 Performance Schema Statement Digests and Sampling").

If a rule cannot be loaded due to some error, calling
`flush_rewrite_rules()` produces an error:

```sql
mysql> CALL query_rewrite.flush_rewrite_rules();
ERROR 1644 (45000): Loading of some rule(s) failed.
```

When this occurs, the plugin writes an error message to the
`message` column of the rule row to
communicate the problem. Check the
`rewrite_rules` table for rows with
non-`NULL` `message` column
values to see what problems exist.

Patterns use the same syntax as prepared statements (see
[Section 15.5.1, “PREPARE Statement”](prepare.md "15.5.1 PREPARE Statement")). Within a pattern template,
`?` characters act as parameter markers that
match data values. The `?` characters should
not be enclosed within quotation marks. Parameter markers can
be used only where data values should appear, and they cannot
be used for SQL keywords, identifiers, functions, and so on.
The plugin parses a statement to identify the literal values
(as defined in [Section 11.1, “Literal Values”](literals.md "11.1 Literal Values")), so you can put a
parameter marker in place of any literal value.

Like the pattern, the replacement can contain
`?` characters. For a statement that matches
a pattern template, the plugin rewrites it, replacing
`?` parameter markers in the replacement
using data values matched by the corresponding markers in the
pattern. The result is a complete statement string. The plugin
asks the server to parse it, and returns the result to the
server as the representation of the rewritten statement.

After adding and loading the rule, check whether rewriting
occurs according to whether statements match the rule pattern:

```sql
mysql> SELECT PI();
+----------+
| PI()     |
+----------+
| 3.141593 |
+----------+
1 row in set (0.01 sec)

mysql> SELECT 10;
+--------+
| 10 + 1 |
+--------+
|     11 |
+--------+
1 row in set, 1 warning (0.00 sec)
```

No rewriting occurs for the first
[`SELECT`](select.md "15.2.13 SELECT Statement") statement, but does for
the second. The second statement illustrates that when the
`Rewriter` plugin rewrites a statement, it
produces a warning message. To view the message, use
[`SHOW WARNINGS`](show-warnings.md "15.7.7.42 SHOW WARNINGS Statement"):

```sql
mysql> SHOW WARNINGS\G
*************************** 1. row ***************************
  Level: Note
   Code: 1105
Message: Query 'SELECT 10' rewritten to 'SELECT 10 + 1' by a query rewrite plugin
```

A statement need not be rewritten to a statement of the same
type. The following example loads a rule that rewrites
[`DELETE`](delete.md "15.2.2 DELETE Statement") statements to
[`UPDATE`](update.md "15.2.17 UPDATE Statement") statements:

```sql
INSERT INTO query_rewrite.rewrite_rules (pattern, replacement)
VALUES('DELETE FROM db1.t1 WHERE col = ?',
       'UPDATE db1.t1 SET col = NULL WHERE col = ?');
CALL query_rewrite.flush_rewrite_rules();
```

To enable or disable an existing rule, modify its
`enabled` column and reload the table into
the plugin. To disable rule 1:

```sql
UPDATE query_rewrite.rewrite_rules SET enabled = 'NO' WHERE id = 1;
CALL query_rewrite.flush_rewrite_rules();
```

This enables you to deactivate a rule without removing it from
the table.

To re-enable rule 1:

```sql
UPDATE query_rewrite.rewrite_rules SET enabled = 'YES' WHERE id = 1;
CALL query_rewrite.flush_rewrite_rules();
```

The `rewrite_rules` table contains a
`pattern_database` column that
`Rewriter` uses for matching table names that
are not qualified with a database name:

- Qualified table names in statements match qualified names
  in the pattern if corresponding database and table names
  are identical.
- Unqualified table names in statements match unqualified
  names in the pattern only if the default database is the
  same as `pattern_database` and the table
  names are identical.

Suppose that a table named `appdb.users` has
a column named `id` and that applications are
expected to select rows from the table using a query of one of
these forms, where the second can be used when
`appdb` is the default database:

```sql
SELECT * FROM users WHERE appdb.id = id_value;
SELECT * FROM users WHERE id = id_value;
```

Suppose also that the `id` column is renamed
to `user_id` (perhaps the table must be
modified to add another type of ID and it is necessary to
indicate more specifically what type of ID the
`id` column represents).

The change means that applications must refer to
`user_id` rather than `id`
in the `WHERE` clause, but old applications
that cannot be updated no longer work properly. The
`Rewriter` plugin can solve this problem by
matching and rewriting problematic statements. To match the
statement `SELECT * FROM appdb.users WHERE id =
value` and rewrite it as
`SELECT * FROM appdb.users WHERE user_id =
value`, you can insert a
row representing a replacement rule into the rewrite rules
table. If you also want to match this
`SELECT` using the unqualified table name, it
is also necessary to add an explicit rule. Using
`?` as a value placeholder, the two
[`INSERT`](insert.md "15.2.7 INSERT Statement") statements needed look
like this:

```sql
INSERT INTO query_rewrite.rewrite_rules
    (pattern, replacement) VALUES(
    'SELECT * FROM appdb.users WHERE id = ?',
    'SELECT * FROM appdb.users WHERE user_id = ?'
    );
INSERT INTO query_rewrite.rewrite_rules
    (pattern, replacement, pattern_database) VALUES(
    'SELECT * FROM users WHERE id = ?',
    'SELECT * FROM users WHERE user_id = ?',
    'appdb'
    );
```

After adding the two new rules, execute the following
statement to cause them to take effect:

```sql
CALL query_rewrite.flush_rewrite_rules();
```

`Rewriter` uses the first rule to match
statements that use the qualified table name, and the second
to match statements that use the unqualified name. The second
rule works only when `appdb` is the default
database.

##### How Statement Matching Works

The `Rewriter` plugin uses statement digests
and digest hash values to match incoming statements against
rewrite rules in stages. The
`max_digest_length` system variable
determines the size of the buffer used for computing statement
digests. Larger values enable computation of digests that
distinguish longer statements. Smaller values use less memory
but increase the likelihood of longer statements colliding
with the same digest value.

The plugin matches each statement to the rewrite rules as
follows:

1. Compute the statement digest hash value and compare it to
   the rule digest hash values. This is subject to false
   positives, but serves as a quick rejection test.
2. If the statement digest hash value matches any pattern
   digest hash values, match the normalized (statement
   digest) form of the statement to the normalized form of
   the matching rule patterns.
3. If the normalized statement matches a rule, compare the
   literal values in the statement and the pattern. A
   `?` character in the pattern matches any
   literal value in the statement. If the statement prepares
   a statement, `?` in the pattern also
   matches `?` in the statement. Otherwise,
   corresponding literals must be the same.

If multiple rules match a statement, it is nondeterministic
which one the plugin uses to rewrite the statement.

If a pattern contains more markers than the replacement, the
plugin discards excess data values. If a pattern contains
fewer markers than the replacement, it is an error. The plugin
notices this when the rules table is loaded, writes an error
message to the `message` column of the rule
row to communicate the problem, and sets the
[`Rewriter_reload_error`](rewriter-query-rewrite-plugin-reference.md#statvar_Rewriter_reload_error) status
variable to `ON`.

##### Rewriting Prepared Statements

Prepared statements are rewritten at parse time (that is, when
they are prepared), not when they are executed later.

Prepared statements differ from nonprepared statements in that
they may contain `?` characters as parameter
markers. To match a `?` in a prepared
statement, a `Rewriter` pattern must contain
`?` in the same location. Suppose that a
rewrite rule has this pattern:

```sql
SELECT ?, 3
```

The following table shows several prepared
[`SELECT`](select.md "15.2.13 SELECT Statement") statements and whether
the rule pattern matches them.

| Prepared Statement | Whether Pattern Matches Statement |
| --- | --- |
| `PREPARE s AS 'SELECT 3, 3'` | Yes |
| `PREPARE s AS 'SELECT ?, 3'` | Yes |
| `PREPARE s AS 'SELECT 3, ?'` | No |
| `PREPARE s AS 'SELECT ?, ?'` | No |

##### Rewriter Plugin Operational Information

The `Rewriter` plugin makes information
available about its operation by means of several status
variables:

```sql
mysql> SHOW GLOBAL STATUS LIKE 'Rewriter%';
+-----------------------------------+-------+
| Variable_name                     | Value |
+-----------------------------------+-------+
| Rewriter_number_loaded_rules      | 1     |
| Rewriter_number_reloads           | 5     |
| Rewriter_number_rewritten_queries | 1     |
| Rewriter_reload_error             | ON    |
+-----------------------------------+-------+
```

For descriptions of these variables, see
[Section 7.6.4.3.4, “Rewriter Query Rewrite Plugin Status Variables”](rewriter-query-rewrite-plugin-reference.md#rewriter-query-rewrite-plugin-status-variables "7.6.4.3.4 Rewriter Query Rewrite Plugin Status Variables").

When you load the rules table by calling the
`flush_rewrite_rules()` stored procedure, if
an error occurs for some rule, the `CALL`
statement produces an error, and the plugin sets the
`Rewriter_reload_error` status variable to
`ON`:

```sql
mysql> CALL query_rewrite.flush_rewrite_rules();
ERROR 1644 (45000): Loading of some rule(s) failed.

mysql> SHOW GLOBAL STATUS LIKE 'Rewriter_reload_error';
+-----------------------+-------+
| Variable_name         | Value |
+-----------------------+-------+
| Rewriter_reload_error | ON    |
+-----------------------+-------+
```

In this case, check the `rewrite_rules` table
for rows with non-`NULL`
`message` column values to see what problems
exist.

##### Rewriter Plugin Use of Character Sets

When the `rewrite_rules` table is loaded into
the `Rewriter` plugin, the plugin interprets
statements using the current global value of the
[`character_set_client`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_character_set_client) system
variable. If the global
[`character_set_client`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_character_set_client) value is
changed subsequently, the rules table must be reloaded.

A client must have a session
[`character_set_client`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_character_set_client) value
identical to what the global value was when the rules table
was loaded or rule matching does not work for that client.
