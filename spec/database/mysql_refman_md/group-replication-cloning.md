#### 20.5.4.2 Cloning for Distributed Recovery

MySQL Server's clone plugin is available from MySQL 8.0.17. If
you want to use remote cloning operations for distributed
recovery in a group, you must set up existing members and
joining members beforehand to support this function. If you do
not want to use this function in a group, do not set it up, in
which case Group Replication only uses state transfer from the
binary log.

To use cloning, at least one existing group member and the
joining member must be set up beforehand to support remote
cloning operations. As a minimum, you must install the clone
plugin on the donor and joining member, grant the
[`BACKUP_ADMIN`](privileges-provided.md#priv_backup-admin) permission to the
replication user for distributed recovery, and set the
[`group_replication_clone_threshold`](group-replication-system-variables.md#sysvar_group_replication_clone_threshold)
system variable to an appropriate level. To ensure the maximum
availability of donors, it is advisable to set up all current
and future group members to support remote cloning operations.

Be aware that a remote cloning operation removes user-created
tablespaces and data from the joining member before transferring
the data from the donor. If the operation is stopped while in
progress, the joining member might be left with partial data or
no data. This can be repaired by retrying the remote cloning
operation, which Group Replication does automatically.

##### 20.5.4.2.1 Prerequisites for Cloning

For full instructions to set up and configure the clone
plugin, see [Section 7.6.7, “The Clone Plugin”](clone-plugin.md "7.6.7 The Clone Plugin") . Detailed
prerequisites for a remote cloning operation are covered in
[Section 7.6.7.3, “Cloning Remote Data”](clone-plugin-remote.md "7.6.7.3 Cloning Remote Data") . For Group Replication,
note the following key points and differences:

- The donor (an existing group member) and the recipient
  (the joining member) must have the clone plugin installed
  and active. For instructions to do this, see
  [Section 7.6.7.1, “Installing the Clone Plugin”](clone-plugin-installation.md "7.6.7.1 Installing the Clone Plugin") .
- The donor and the recipient must run on the same operating
  system, and must use the same MySQL Server release series.
  Cloning is therefore not suitable for groups where members
  run different minor MySQL Server versions, such as MySQL
  8.0 and 8.4.

  Prior to MySQL 8.0.37, cloning required that donors and
  recipients used the same point release; this restriction
  still applies if the donor, recipient, or both use MySQL
  8.0.36 or earlier.
- The donor and the recipient must have the Group
  Replication plugin installed and active, and any other
  plugins that are active on the donor (such as a keyring
  plugin) must also be active on the recipient.
- If distributed recovery is configured to use SSL
  ([`group_replication_recovery_use_ssl=ON`](group-replication-system-variables.md#sysvar_group_replication_recovery_use_ssl)),
  Group Replication applies this setting for remote cloning
  operations. Group Replication automatically configures the
  settings for the clone SSL options
  ([`clone_ssl_ca`](clone-plugin-options-variables.md#sysvar_clone_ssl_ca),
  [`clone_ssl_cert`](clone-plugin-options-variables.md#sysvar_clone_ssl_cert), and
  [`clone_ssl_key`](clone-plugin-options-variables.md#sysvar_clone_ssl_key)) to match
  your settings for the corresponding Group Replication
  distributed recovery options
  ([`group_replication_recovery_ssl_ca`](group-replication-system-variables.md#sysvar_group_replication_recovery_ssl_ca),
  [`group_replication_recovery_ssl_cert`](group-replication-system-variables.md#sysvar_group_replication_recovery_ssl_cert),
  and
  [`group_replication_recovery_ssl_key`](group-replication-system-variables.md#sysvar_group_replication_recovery_ssl_key)).
- You do not need to set up a list of valid donors in the
  [`clone_valid_donor_list`](clone-plugin-options-variables.md#sysvar_clone_valid_donor_list)
  system variable for the purpose of joining a replication
  group. Group Replication configures this setting
  automatically for you after it selects a donor from the
  existing group members. Note that remote cloning
  operations use the server's SQL protocol hostname and
  port.
- The clone plugin has a number of system variables to
  manage the network load and performance impact of the
  remote cloning operation. Group Replication does not
  configure these settings, so you can review them and set
  them if you want to, or allow them to default. Note that
  when a remote cloning operation is used for distributed
  recovery, the clone plugin's
  [`clone_enable_compression`](clone-plugin-options-variables.md#sysvar_clone_enable_compression)
  setting applies to the operation, rather than the Group
  Replication compression setting.
- To invoke the remote cloning operation on the recipient,
  Group Replication uses the internal
  `mysql.session` user, which already has
  the [`CLONE_ADMIN`](privileges-provided.md#priv_clone-admin) privilege,
  so you do not need to set this up.
- As the clone user on the donor for the remote cloning
  operation, Group Replication uses the replication user
  that you set up for distributed recovery (which is covered
  in [Section 20.2.1.3, “User Credentials For Distributed Recovery”](group-replication-user-credentials.md "20.2.1.3 User Credentials For Distributed Recovery")).
  You must therefore give the
  [`BACKUP_ADMIN`](privileges-provided.md#priv_backup-admin) privilege to
  this replication user on all group members that support
  cloning. Also give the privilege to the replication user
  on joining members when you are configuring them for Group
  Replication, because they can act as donors after they
  join the group. The same replication user is used for
  distributed recovery on every group member. To give this
  privilege to the replication user on existing members, you
  can issue this statement on each group member individually
  with binary logging disabled, or on one group member with
  binary logging enabled:

  ```sql
  GRANT BACKUP_ADMIN ON *.* TO rpl_user@'%';
  ```
- If you use [`START
  GROUP_REPLICATION`](start-group-replication.md "15.4.3.1 START GROUP_REPLICATION Statement") to specify the replication
  user credentials on a server that previously supplied the
  user credentials using [`CHANGE
  REPLICATION SOURCE TO`](change-replication-source-to.md "15.4.2.3 CHANGE REPLICATION SOURCE TO Statement") |
  [`CHANGE MASTER TO`](change-master-to.md "15.4.2.1 CHANGE MASTER TO Statement"), ensure
  that you remove the user credentials from the replication
  metadata repositories before any remote cloning operations
  take place. Also ensure that
  [`group_replication_start_on_boot=OFF`](group-replication-system-variables.md#sysvar_group_replication_start_on_boot)
  is set on the joining member. For instructions, see
  [Section 20.6.3, “Securing Distributed Recovery Connections”](group-replication-distributed-recovery-securing.md "20.6.3 Securing Distributed Recovery Connections").
  If you do not unset the user credentials, they are
  transferred to the joining member during remote cloning
  operations. The
  `group_replication_recovery` channel
  could then be inadvertently started with the stored
  credentials, on either the original member or members that
  were cloned from it. An automatic start of Group
  Replication on server boot (including after a remote
  cloning operation) would use the stored user credentials,
  and they would also be used if an operator did not specify
  the distributed recovery credentials in a
  [`START GROUP_REPLICATION`](start-group-replication.md "15.4.3.1 START GROUP_REPLICATION Statement")
  statement.

##### 20.5.4.2.2 Threshold for Cloning

When group members have been set up to support cloning, the
[`group_replication_clone_threshold`](group-replication-system-variables.md#sysvar_group_replication_clone_threshold)
system variable specifies a threshold, expressed as a number
of transactions, for the use of a remote cloning operation in
distributed recovery. If the gap between the transactions on
the donor and the transactions on the joining member is larger
than this number, a remote cloning operation is used for state
transfer to the joining member when this is technically
possible. Group Replication calculates whether the threshold
has been exceeded based on the
[`gtid_executed`](replication-options-gtids.md#sysvar_gtid_executed) sets of the
existing group members. Using a remote cloning operation in
the event of a large transaction gap lets you add new members
to the group without transferring the group's data to the
server manually beforehand, and also enables a member that is
very out of date to catch up more efficiently.

The default setting for the
[`group_replication_clone_threshold`](group-replication-system-variables.md#sysvar_group_replication_clone_threshold)
Group Replication system variable is extremely high (the
maximum permitted sequence number for a transaction in a
GTID), so it effectively deactivates cloning wherever state
transfer from the binary log is possible. To enable Group
Replication to select a remote cloning operation for state
transfer where this is more appropriate, set the system
variable to specify a number of transactions as the
transaction gap above which you want cloning to take place.

Warning

Do not use a low setting for
[`group_replication_clone_threshold`](group-replication-system-variables.md#sysvar_group_replication_clone_threshold)
in an active group. If a number of transactions above the
threshold takes place in the group while the remote cloning
operation is in progress, the joining member triggers a
remote cloning operation again after restarting, and could
continue this indefinitely. To avoid this situation, ensure
that you set the threshold to a number higher than the
number of transactions that you would expect to occur in the
group during the time taken for the remote cloning
operation.

Group Replication attempts to execute a remote cloning
operation regardless of your threshold when state transfer
from a donor's binary log is impossible, for example because
the transactions needed by the joining member are not
available in the binary log on any existing group member.
Group Replication identifies this based on the
[`gtid_purged`](replication-options-gtids.md#sysvar_gtid_purged) sets of the
existing group members. You cannot use the
[`group_replication_clone_threshold`](group-replication-system-variables.md#sysvar_group_replication_clone_threshold)
system variable to deactivate cloning when the required
transactions are not available in any member's binary log
files, because in that situation cloning is the only
alternative to transferring data to the joining member
manually.

##### 20.5.4.2.3 Cloning Operations

When group members and joining members are set up for cloning,
Group Replication manages remote cloning operations for you. A
remote cloning operation might take some time to complete,
depending on the size of the data. See
[Section 7.6.7.10, “Monitoring Cloning Operations”](clone-plugin-monitoring.md "7.6.7.10 Monitoring Cloning Operations") for information on
monitoring the process.

Note

When state transfer is complete, Group Replication restarts
the joining member to complete the process. If
[`group_replication_start_on_boot=OFF`](group-replication-system-variables.md#sysvar_group_replication_start_on_boot)
is set on the joining member, for example because you
specify the replication user credentials on the
[`START GROUP_REPLICATION`](start-group-replication.md "15.4.3.1 START GROUP_REPLICATION Statement")
statement, you must issue [`START
GROUP_REPLICATION`](start-group-replication.md "15.4.3.1 START GROUP_REPLICATION Statement") manually again following this
restart. If
[`group_replication_start_on_boot=ON`](group-replication-system-variables.md#sysvar_group_replication_start_on_boot)
and other settings required to start Group Replication were
set in a configuration file or using a `SET
PERSIST` statement, you do not need to intervene
and the process continues automatically to bring the joining
member online.

If the remote cloning procedure takes a long time, in releases
before MySQL 8.0.22, it is possible for the set of
certification information that accumulates for the group
during that time to become too large to transmit to the
joining member. In that case, the joining member logs an error
message and does not join the group. From MySQL 8.0.22, Group
Replication manages the garbage collection process for applied
transactions differently to avoid this scenario. In earlier
releases, if you do see this error, after the remote cloning
operation completes, wait two minutes to allow a round of
garbage collection to take place to reduce the size of the
group's certification information. Then issue the following
statement on the joining member, so that it stops trying to
apply the previous set of certification information:

```sql
RESET SLAVE FOR CHANNEL group_replication_recovery;
Or from MySQL 8.0.22:
RESET REPLICA FOR CHANNEL group_replication_recovery;
```

A remote cloning operation clones settings that are persisted
in tables from the donor to the recipient, as well as the
data. Group Replication manages the settings that relate
specifically to Group Replication channels. Group Replication
member settings that are persisted in configuration files,
such as the group replication local address, are not cloned
and are not changed on the joining member. Group Replication
also preserves the channel settings that relate to the use of
SSL, so these are unique to the individual member.

If the replication user credentials used by the donor for the
`group_replication_recovery` replication
channel have been stored in the replication metadata
repositories using a [`CHANGE REPLICATION
SOURCE TO`](change-replication-source-to.md "15.4.2.3 CHANGE REPLICATION SOURCE TO Statement") | [`CHANGE MASTER
TO`](change-master-to.md "15.4.2.1 CHANGE MASTER TO Statement") statement, they are transferred to and used by
the joining member after cloning, and they must be valid
there. With stored credentials, all group members that
received state transfer by a remote cloning operation
therefore automatically receive the replication user and
password for distributed recovery. If you specify the
replication user credentials on the [`START
GROUP_REPLICATION`](start-group-replication.md "15.4.3.1 START GROUP_REPLICATION Statement") statement, these are used to start
the remote cloning operation, but they are not transferred to
and used by the joining member after cloning. If you do not
want the credentials transferred to new joiners and recorded
there, ensure that you unset them before remote cloning
operations take place, as described in
[Section 20.6.3, “Securing Distributed Recovery Connections”](group-replication-distributed-recovery-securing.md "20.6.3 Securing Distributed Recovery Connections"),
and use [`START GROUP_REPLICATION`](start-group-replication.md "15.4.3.1 START GROUP_REPLICATION Statement")
to supply them instead.

If a `PRIVILEGE_CHECKS_USER` account has been
used to help secure the replication appliers (see
[Section 19.3.3.2, “Privilege Checks For Group Replication Channels”](replication-privilege-checks-gr.md "19.3.3.2 Privilege Checks For Group Replication Channels")), from MySQL
8.0.19, the `PRIVILEGE_CHECKS_USER` account
and related settings from the donor are cloned to the joining
member. If the joining member is set to start Group
Replication on boot, it automatically uses the account for
privilege checks on the appropriate replication channels. (In
MySQL 8.0.18, due to a number of limitations, it is
recommended that you do not use a
`PRIVILEGE_CHECKS_USER` account with Group
Replication channels.)

##### 20.5.4.2.4 Cloning for Other Purposes

Group Replication initiates and manages cloning operations for
distributed recovery. Group members that have been set up to
support cloning may also participate in cloning operations
that a user initiates manually. For example, you might want to
create a new server instance by cloning from a group member as
the donor, but you do not want the new server instance to join
the group immediately, or maybe not ever.

In all releases that support cloning, you can initiate a
cloning operation manually involving a group member on which
Group Replication is stopped. Note that because cloning
requires that the active plugins on a donor and recipient must
match, the Group Replication plugin must be installed and
active on the other server instance, even if you do not intend
that server instance to join a group. You can install the
plugin by issuing this statement:

```sql
INSTALL PLUGIN group_replication SONAME 'group_replication.so';
```

In releases before MySQL 8.0.20, you cannot initiate a cloning
operation manually if the operation involves a group member on
which Group Replication is running. From MySQL 8.0.20, you can
do this, provided that the cloning operation does not remove
and replace the data on the recipient. The statement to
initiate the cloning operation must therefore include the
`DATA DIRECTORY` clause if Group Replication
is running.
