### 19.5.3 Upgrading a Replication Topology

When you upgrade servers that participate in a replication
topology, you need to take into account each server's role in the
topology and look out for issues specific to replication. For
general information and instructions for upgrading a MySQL Server
instance, see [Chapter 3, *Upgrading MySQL*](upgrading.md "Chapter 3 Upgrading MySQL").

As explained in
[Section 19.5.2, “Replication Compatibility Between MySQL Versions”](replication-compatibility.md "19.5.2 Replication Compatibility Between MySQL Versions"), MySQL supports
replication from a source running one release series to a replica
running the next higher release series, but does not support
replication from a source running a later release to a replica
running an earlier release. A replica at an earlier release might
not have the required capability to process transactions that can
be handled by the source at a later release. You must therefore
upgrade all of the replicas in a replication topology to the
target MySQL Server release, before you upgrade the source server
to the target release. In this way you will never be in the
situation where a replica still at the earlier release is
attempting to handle transactions from a source at the later
release.

In a replication topology where there are multiple sources
(multi-source replication), the use of more than two MySQL Server
versions is not supported, regardless of the number of source or
replica MySQL servers. This restriction applies not only to
release series, but to version numbers within the same release
series as well. For example, you cannot use MySQL
8.0.22, MySQL 8.0.24, and MySQL
8.0.28 concurrently in such a setup, although you
could use any two of these releases together.

If you need to downgrade the servers in a replication topology,
the source must be downgraded before the replicas are downgraded.
On the replicas, you must ensure that the binary log and relay log
have been fully processed, and remove them before proceeding with
the downgrade.

#### Behavior Changes Between Releases

Although this upgrade sequence is correct, it is possible to
still encounter replication difficulties when replicating from a
source at an earlier release that has not yet been upgraded, to
a replica at a later release that has been upgraded. This can
happen if the source uses statements or relies on behavior that
is no longer supported in the later release installed on the
replica. You can use MySQL Shell's upgrade checker utility
`util.checkForServerUpgrade()` to check MySQL
5.7 server instances or MySQL 8.0 server instances for upgrade
to a GA MySQL 8.0 release. The utility identifies anything that
needs to be fixed for that server instance so that it does not
cause an issue after the upgrade, including features and
behaviors that are no longer available in the later release. See
[Upgrade Checker Utility](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/mysql-shell/8.0/en/mysql-shell-utilities-upgrade.html) for
information on the upgrade checker utility.

If you are upgrading an existing replication setup from a
version of MySQL that does not support global transaction
identifiers (GTIDs) to a version that does, only enable GTIDs on
the source and the replicas when you have made sure that the
setup meets all the requirements for GTID-based replication. See
[Section 19.1.3.4, “Setting Up Replication Using GTIDs”](replication-gtids-howto.md "19.1.3.4 Setting Up Replication Using GTIDs") for information about
converting binary log file position based replication setups to
use GTID-based replication.

Changes affecting operations in strict SQL mode
([`STRICT_TRANS_TABLES`](sql-mode.md#sqlmode_strict_trans_tables) or
[`STRICT_ALL_TABLES`](sql-mode.md#sqlmode_strict_all_tables)) may result
in replication failure on an upgraded replica. If you use
statement-based logging
([`binlog_format=STATEMENT`](replication-options-binary-log.md#sysvar_binlog_format)),
if a replica is upgraded before the source, the source executes
statements which succeed there but which may fail on the replica
and so cause replication to stop. To deal with this, stop all
new statements on the source and wait until the replicas catch
up, then upgrade the replicas. Alternatively, if you cannot stop
new statements, temporarily change to row-based logging on the
source
([`binlog_format=ROW`](replication-options-binary-log.md#sysvar_binlog_format))
and wait until all replicas have processed all binary logs
produced up to the point of this change, then upgrade the
replicas.

The default character set has changed from
`latin1` to `utf8mb4` in MySQL
8.0. In a replicated setting, when upgrading from MySQL 5.7 to
8.0, it is advisable to change the default character set back to
the character set used in MySQL 5.7 before upgrading. After the
upgrade is completed, the default character set can be changed
to `utf8mb4`. Assuming that the previous
defaults were used, one way to preserve them is to start the
server with these lines in the `my.cnf` file:

```ini
[mysqld]
character_set_server=latin1
collation_server=latin1_swedish_ci
```

#### Standard Upgrade Procedure

To upgrade a replication topology, follow the instructions in
[Chapter 3, *Upgrading MySQL*](upgrading.md "Chapter 3 Upgrading MySQL") for each individual MySQL Server
instance, using this overall procedure:

1. Upgrade the replicas first. On each replica instance:

   - Carry out the preliminary checks and steps described in
     [Section 3.6, “Preparing Your Installation for Upgrade”](upgrade-prerequisites.md "3.6 Preparing Your Installation for Upgrade").
   - Shut down MySQL Server.
   - Upgrade the MySQL Server binaries or packages.
   - Restart MySQL Server.
   - If you have upgraded to a release earlier than MySQL
     8.0.16, invoke [**mysql\_upgrade**](mysql-upgrade.md "6.4.5 mysql_upgrade — Check and Upgrade MySQL Tables") manually
     to upgrade the system tables and schemas. When the
     server is running with global transaction identifiers
     (GTIDs) enabled
     ([`gtid_mode=ON`](replication-options-gtids.md#sysvar_gtid_mode)), do not
     enable binary logging by
     [**mysql\_upgrade**](mysql-upgrade.md "6.4.5 mysql_upgrade — Check and Upgrade MySQL Tables") (so do not use the
     [`--write-binlog`](mysql-upgrade.md#option_mysql_upgrade_write-binlog)
     option). Then shut down and restart the server.
   - If you have upgraded to MySQL 8.0.16 or later, do not
     invoke [**mysql\_upgrade**](mysql-upgrade.md "6.4.5 mysql_upgrade — Check and Upgrade MySQL Tables"). From that
     release, MySQL Server performs the entire MySQL upgrade
     procedure, disabling binary logging during the upgrade.
   - Restart replication using a [`START
     REPLICA`](start-replica.md "15.4.2.6 START REPLICA Statement") or [`START
     SLAVE`](start-slave.md "15.4.2.7 START SLAVE Statement") statement.
2. When all the replicas have been upgraded, follow the same
   steps to upgrade and restart the source server, with the
   exception of the [`START
   REPLICA`](start-replica.md "15.4.2.6 START REPLICA Statement") or [`START
   SLAVE`](start-slave.md "15.4.2.7 START SLAVE Statement") statement. If you made a temporary change to
   row-based logging or to the default character set, you can
   revert the change now.

#### Upgrade Procedure With Table Repair Or Rebuild

Some upgrades may require that you drop and re-create database
objects when you move from one MySQL series to the next. For
example, collation changes might require that table indexes be
rebuilt. Such operations, if necessary, are detailed at
[Section 3.5, “Changes in MySQL 8.0”](upgrading-from-previous-series.md "3.5 Changes in MySQL 8.0"). It is
safest to perform these operations separately on the replicas
and the source, and to disable replication of these operations
from the source to the replica. To achieve this, use the
following procedure:

1. Stop all the replicas and upgrade the binaries or packages.
   Restart them with the
   [`--skip-slave-start`](replication-options-replica.md#option_mysqld_skip-slave-start) option, or
   from MySQL 8.0.24, the
   [`skip_slave_start`](replication-options-replica.md#sysvar_skip_slave_start)
   system variable, so that they do not connect to the source.
   Perform any table repair or rebuilding operations needed to
   re-create database objects, such as use of `REPAIR
   TABLE` or `ALTER TABLE`, or
   dumping and reloading tables or triggers.
2. Disable the binary log on the source. To do this without
   restarting the source, execute a `SET sql_log_bin =
   OFF` statement. Alternatively, stop the source and
   restart it with the
   [`--skip-log-bin`](replication-options-binary-log.md#option_mysqld_log-bin)
   option. If you restart the source, you might also want to
   disallow client connections. For example, if all clients
   connect using TCP/IP, enable the
   [`skip_networking`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_skip_networking)
   system variable when you restart the source.
3. With the binary log disabled, perform any table repair or
   rebuilding operations needed to re-create database objects.
   The binary log must be disabled during this step to prevent
   these operations from being logged and sent to the replicas
   later.
4. Re-enable the binary log on the source. If you set
   [`sql_log_bin`](replication-options-binary-log.md#sysvar_sql_log_bin) to
   `OFF` earlier, execute a `SET
   sql_log_bin = ON` statement. If you restarted the
   source to disable the binary log, restart it without
   [`--skip-log-bin`](replication-options-binary-log.md#option_mysqld_log-bin),
   and without enabling the
   [`skip_networking`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_skip_networking) system
   variable so that clients and replicas can connect.
5. Restart the replicas, this time without the
   [`--skip-slave-start`](replication-options-replica.md#option_mysqld_skip-slave-start) option or
   [`skip_slave_start`](replication-options-replica.md#sysvar_skip_slave_start) system
   variable.
