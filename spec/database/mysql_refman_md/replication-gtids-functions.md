#### 19.1.3.8 Stored Function Examples to Manipulate GTIDs

This section provides examples of stored functions (see
[Chapter 27, *Stored Objects*](stored-objects.md "Chapter 27 Stored Objects")) which you can create using some
of the built-in functions provided by MySQL for use with
GTID-based replication, listed here:

- [`GTID_SUBSET()`](gtid-functions.md#function_gtid-subset): Shows whether
  one GTID set is a subset of another.
- [`GTID_SUBTRACT()`](gtid-functions.md#function_gtid-subtract): Returns the
  GTIDs from one GTID set that are not in another.
- `WAIT_FOR_EXECUTED_GTID_SET()`: Waits until
  all transactions in a given GTID set have been executed.

See [Section 14.18.2, “Functions Used with Global Transaction Identifiers (GTIDs)”](gtid-functions.md "14.18.2 Functions Used with Global Transaction Identifiers (GTIDs)"), more more information about
the functions just listed.

Note that in these stored functions, the delimiter command has
been used to change the MySQL statement delimiter to a vertical
bar, like this:

```sql
mysql> delimiter |
```

All of the stored functions shown in this section take string
representations of GTID sets as arguments, so GTID sets must
always be quoted when used with them.

This function returns nonzero (true) if two GTID sets are the same
set, even if they are not formatted in the same way:

```sql
CREATE FUNCTION GTID_IS_EQUAL(gs1 LONGTEXT, gs2 LONGTEXT)
  RETURNS INT
  RETURN GTID_SUBSET(gs1, gs2) AND GTID_SUBSET(gs2, gs1)
|
```

This function returns nonzero (true) if two GTID sets are
disjoint:

```sql
CREATE FUNCTION GTID_IS_DISJOINT(gs1 LONGTEXT, gs2 LONGTEXT)
RETURNS INT
  RETURN GTID_SUBSET(gs1, GTID_SUBTRACT(gs1, gs2))
|
```

This function returns nonzero (true) if two GTID sets are disjoint
and `sum` is their union:

```sql
CREATE FUNCTION GTID_IS_DISJOINT_UNION(gs1 LONGTEXT, gs2 LONGTEXT, sum LONGTEXT)
RETURNS INT
  RETURN GTID_IS_EQUAL(GTID_SUBTRACT(sum, gs1), gs2) AND
         GTID_IS_EQUAL(GTID_SUBTRACT(sum, gs2), gs1)
|
```

This function returns a normalized form of the GTID set, in all
uppercase, with no whitespace and no duplicates, with UUIDs in
alphabetic order and intervals in numeric order:

```sql
CREATE FUNCTION GTID_NORMALIZE(gs LONGTEXT)
RETURNS LONGTEXT
  RETURN GTID_SUBTRACT(gs, '')
|
```

This function returns the union of two GTID sets:

```sql
CREATE FUNCTION GTID_UNION(gs1 LONGTEXT, gs2 LONGTEXT)
RETURNS LONGTEXT
  RETURN GTID_NORMALIZE(CONCAT(gs1, ',', gs2))
|
```

This function returns the intersection of two GTID sets.

```sql
CREATE FUNCTION GTID_INTERSECTION(gs1 LONGTEXT, gs2 LONGTEXT)
RETURNS LONGTEXT
  RETURN GTID_SUBTRACT(gs1, GTID_SUBTRACT(gs1, gs2))
|
```

This function returns the symmetric difference between two GTID
sets, that is, the GTIDs that exist in `gs1` but
not in `gs2`, as well as the GTIDs that exist in
`gs2` but not in `gs1`.

```sql
CREATE FUNCTION GTID_SYMMETRIC_DIFFERENCE(gs1 LONGTEXT, gs2 LONGTEXT)
RETURNS LONGTEXT
  RETURN GTID_SUBTRACT(CONCAT(gs1, ',', gs2), GTID_INTERSECTION(gs1, gs2))
|
```

This function removes from a GTID set all the GTIDs with the
specified origin, and returns the remaining GTIDs, if any. The
UUID is the identifier used by the server where the transaction
originated, which is normally the value of
[`server_uuid`](replication-options.md#sysvar_server_uuid).

```sql
CREATE FUNCTION GTID_SUBTRACT_UUID(gs LONGTEXT, uuid TEXT)
RETURNS LONGTEXT
  RETURN GTID_SUBTRACT(gs, CONCAT(UUID, ':1-', (1 << 63) - 2))
|
```

This function acts as the reverse of the previous one; it returns
only those GTIDs from the GTID set that originate from the server
with the specified identifier (UUID).

```sql
CREATE FUNCTION GTID_INTERSECTION_WITH_UUID(gs LONGTEXT, uuid TEXT)
RETURNS LONGTEXT
  RETURN GTID_SUBTRACT(gs, GTID_SUBTRACT_UUID(gs, uuid))
|
```

**Example 19.1 Verifying that a replica is up to date**

The built-in functions
[`GTID_SUBSET()`](gtid-functions.md#function_gtid-subset) and
[`GTID_SUBTRACT()`](gtid-functions.md#function_gtid-subtract) can be used to
check that a replica has applied at least every transaction that
a source has applied.

To perform this check with `GTID_SUBSET()`,
execute the following statement on the replica:

```sql
SELECT GTID_SUBSET(source_gtid_executed, replica_gtid_executed);
```

If the returns value is `0` (false), this means
that some GTIDs in
*`source_gtid_executed`* are not present
in *`replica_gtid_executed`*, and that
the replica has not yet applied transactions that were applied
on the source, which means that the replica is not up to date.

To perform the same check with
`GTID_SUBTRACT()`, execute the following
statement on the replica:

```sql
SELECT GTID_SUBTRACT(source_gtid_executed, replica_gtid_executed);
```

This statement returns any GTIDs that are in
*`source_gtid_executed`* but not in
*`replica_gtid_executed`*. If any GTIDs
are returned, the source has applied some transactions that the
replica has not applied, and the replica is therefore not up to
date.

**Example 19.2 Backup and restore scenario**

The stored functions `GTID_IS_EQUAL()`,
`GTID_IS_DISJOINT()`, and
`GTID_IS_DISJOINT_UNION()` can be used to
verify backup and restore operations involving multiple
databases and servers. In this example scenario,
`server1` contains database
`db1`, and `server2` contains
database `db2`. The goal is to copy database
`db2` to `server1`, and the
result on `server1` should be the union of the
two databases. The procedure used is to back up
`server2` using [**mysqldump**](mysqldump.md "6.5.4 mysqldump — A Database Backup Program"),
then to restore this backup on `server1`.

Provided that [**mysqldump**](mysqldump.md "6.5.4 mysqldump — A Database Backup Program") was run with
[`--set-gtid-purged`](mysqldump.md#option_mysqldump_set-gtid-purged) set to
`ON` or `AUTO` (the default),
the output contains a `SET
@@GLOBAL.gtid_purged` statement which adds the
[`gtid_executed`](replication-options-gtids.md#sysvar_gtid_executed) set from
`server2` to the
[`gtid_purged`](replication-options-gtids.md#sysvar_gtid_purged) set on
`server1`. `gtid_purged`
contains the GTIDs of all the transactions that have been
committed on a given server but which do not exist in any binary
log file on the server. When database `db2` is
copied to `server1`, the GTIDs of the
transactions committed on `server2`, which are
not in the binary log files on `server1`, must
be added to `gtid_purged` for
`server1` to make the set complete.

The stored functions can be used to assist with the following
steps in this scenario:

- Use `GTID_IS_EQUAL()` to verify that the
  backup operation computed the correct GTID set for the
  `SET @@GLOBAL.gtid_purged` statement. On
  `server2`, extract that statement from the
  [**mysqldump**](mysqldump.md "6.5.4 mysqldump — A Database Backup Program") output, and store the GTID set
  into a local variable, such as
  `$gtid_purged_set`. Then execute the
  following statement:

  ```sql
  server2> SELECT GTID_IS_EQUAL($gtid_purged_set, @@GLOBAL.gtid_executed);
  ```

  If the result is 1, the two GTID sets are equal, and the set
  has been computed correctly.
- Use `GTID_IS_DISJOINT()` to verify that the
  GTID set in the [**mysqldump**](mysqldump.md "6.5.4 mysqldump — A Database Backup Program") output does not
  overlap with the `gtid_executed` set on
  `server1`. Having identical GTIDs present
  on both servers causes errors when copying database
  `db2` to `server1`. To
  check, on `server1`, extract and store
  `gtid_purged` from the output into a local
  variable as done previously, then execute the following
  statement:

  ```sql
  server1> SELECT GTID_IS_DISJOINT($gtid_purged_set, @@GLOBAL.gtid_executed);
  ```

  If the result is 1, there is no overlap between the two GTID
  sets, so no duplicate GTIDs are present.
- Use `GTID_IS_DISJOINT_UNION()` to verify
  that the restore operation resulted in the correct GTID
  state on `server1`. Before restoring the
  backup, on `server1`, obtain the existing
  `gtid_executed` set by executing the
  following statement:

  ```sql
  server1> SELECT @@GLOBAL.gtid_executed;
  ```

  Store the result in a local variable
  `$original_gtid_executed`, as well as the
  set from `gtid_purged` in another local
  variable as described previously. When the backup from
  `server2` has been restored onto
  `server1`, execute the following statement
  to verify the GTID state:

  ```sql
  server1> SELECT
        ->   GTID_IS_DISJOINT_UNION($original_gtid_executed,
        ->                          $gtid_purged_set,
        ->                          @@GLOBAL.gtid_executed);
  ```

  If the result is `1`, the stored function
  has verified that the original
  `gtid_executed` set from
  `server1`
  (`$original_gtid_executed`) and the
  `gtid_purged` set that was added from
  `server2`
  (`$gtid_purged_set`) have no overlap, and
  that the updated `gtid_executed` set on
  `server1` now consists of the previous
  `gtid_executed` set from
  `server1` plus the
  `gtid_purged` set from
  `server2`, which is the desired result.
  Ensure that this check is carried out before any further
  transactions take place on `server1`,
  otherwise the new transactions in
  `gtid_executed` cause it to fail.

**Example 19.3 Selecting the most up-to-date replica for manual failover**

The stored function `GTID_UNION()` can be used
to identify the most up-to-date replica from a set of replicas,
in order to perform a manual failover operation after a source
server has stopped unexpectedly. If some of the replicas are
experiencing replication lag, this stored function can be used
to compute the most up-to-date replica without waiting for all
the replicas to apply their existing relay logs, and therefore
to minimize the failover time. The function can return the union
of [`gtid_executed`](replication-options-gtids.md#sysvar_gtid_executed) on each
replica with the set of transactions received by the replica,
which is recorded in the Performance Schema
[`replication_connection_status`](performance-schema-replication-connection-status-table.md "29.12.11.11 The replication_connection_status Table")
table. You can compare these results to find which
replica's record of transactions is the most up to date,
even if not all of the transactions have been committed yet.

On each replica, compute the complete record of transactions by
issuing the following statement:

```sql
SELECT GTID_UNION(RECEIVED_TRANSACTION_SET, @@GLOBAL.gtid_executed)
    FROM performance_schema.replication_connection_status
    WHERE channel_name = 'name';
```

You can then compare the results from each replica to see which
one has the most up-to-date record of transactions, and use this
replica as the new source.

**Example 19.4 Checking for extraneous transactions on a replica**

The stored function `GTID_SUBTRACT_UUID()` can
be used to check whether a replica has received transactions
that did not originate from its designated source or sources. If
it has, there might be an issue with your replication setup, or
with a proxy, router, or load balancer. This function works by
removing from a GTID set all the GTIDs from a specified
originating server, and returning the remaining GTIDs, if any.

For a replica with a single source, issue the following
statement, giving the identifier of the originating source,
which is normally the same as
[`server_uuid`](replication-options.md#sysvar_server_uuid):

```sql
SELECT GTID_SUBTRACT_UUID(@@GLOBAL.gtid_executed, server_uuid_of_source);
```

If the result is not empty, the transactions returned are extra
transactions that did not originate from the designated source.

For a replica in a multisource topology, include the server UUID
of each source in the function call, like this:

```sql
SELECT
  GTID_SUBTRACT_UUID(GTID_SUBTRACT_UUID(@@GLOBAL.gtid_executed,
                                        server_uuid_of_source_1),
                                        server_uuid_of_source_2);
```

If the result is not empty, the transactions returned are extra
transactions that did not originate from any of the designated
sources.

**Example 19.5 Verifying that a server in a replication topology is read-only**

The stored function
`GTID_INTERSECTION_WITH_UUID()` can be used to
verify that a server has not originated any GTIDs and is in a
read-only state. The function returns only those GTIDs from the
GTID set that originate from the server with the specified
identifier. If any of the transactions listed in
[`gtid_executed`](replication-options-gtids.md#sysvar_gtid_executed) from this server
use the server's own identifier, the server itself
originated those transactions. You can issue the following
statement on the server to check:

```sql
SELECT GTID_INTERSECTION_WITH_UUID(@@GLOBAL.gtid_executed, my_server_uuid);
```

**Example 19.6 Validating an additional replica in multisource replication**

The stored function
`GTID_INTERSECTION_WITH_UUID()` can be used to
find out if a replica attached to a multisource replication
setup has applied all the transactions originating from one
particular source. In this scenario, `source1`
and `source2` are both sources and replicas and
replicate to each other. `source2` also has its
own replica. The replica also receives and applies transactions
from `source1` if `source2` is
configured with
[`log_replica_updates=ON`](replication-options-binary-log.md#sysvar_log_replica_updates), but it
does not do so if `source2` uses
`log_replica_updates=OFF`. Whichever the case,
we currently want only to find out if the replica is up to date
with `source2`. In this situation,
`GTID_INTERSECTION_WITH_UUID()` can be used to
identify the transactions that `source2`
originated, discarding the transactions that
`source2` has replicated from
`source1`. The built-in function
[`GTID_SUBSET()`](gtid-functions.md#function_gtid-subset) can then be used to
compare the result with the
[`gtid_executed`](replication-options-gtids.md#sysvar_gtid_executed) set on the
replica. If the replica is up to date with
`source2`, the `gtid_executed`
set on the replica contains all the transactions in the
intersection set (the transactions that originated from
`source2`).

To carry out this check, store the values of
`gtid_executed` and the server UUID from
`source2` and the value of
[`gtid_executed`](replication-options-gtids.md#sysvar_gtid_executed) from the replica
into user variables as follows:

```sql
source2> SELECT @@GLOBAL.gtid_executed INTO @source2_gtid_executed;

source2> SELECT @@GLOBAL.server_uuid INTO @source2_server_uuid;

replica> SELECT @@GLOBAL.gtid_executed INTO @replica_gtid_executed;
```

Then use `GTID_INTERSECTION_WITH_UUID()` and
`GTID_SUBSET()` with these variables as input,
as follows:

```sql
SELECT
  GTID_SUBSET(
    GTID_INTERSECTION_WITH_UUID(@source2_gtid_executed,
                                @source2_server_uuid),
                                @replica_gtid_executed);
```

The server identifier from `source2`
(`@source2_server_uuid`) is used with
`GTID_INTERSECTION_WITH_UUID()` to identify and
return only those GTIDs from the set of GTIDs that originated on
`source2`, omitting those that originated on
`source1`. The resulting GTID set is then
compared with the set of all executed GTIDs on the replica,
using `GTID_SUBSET()`. If this statement
returns nonzero (true), all the identified GTIDs from
`source2` (the first set input) are also found
in [`gtid_executed`](replication-options-gtids.md#sysvar_gtid_executed) from the
replica, meaning that the replica has received and executed all
the transactions that originated from
`source2`.
