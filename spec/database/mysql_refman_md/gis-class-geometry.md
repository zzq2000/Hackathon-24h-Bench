#### 13.4.2.2 Geometry Class

`Geometry` is the root class of the
hierarchy. It is a noninstantiable class but has a number of
properties, described in the following list, that are common
to all geometry values created from any of the
`Geometry` subclasses. Particular subclasses
have their own specific properties, described later.

**Geometry Properties**

A geometry value has the following properties:

- Its **type**. Each geometry
  belongs to one of the instantiable classes in the
  hierarchy.
- Its **SRID**, or spatial
  reference identifier. This value identifies the geometry's
  associated spatial reference system that describes the
  coordinate space in which the geometry object is defined.

  In MySQL, the SRID value is an integer associated with the
  geometry value. The maximum usable SRID value is
  232−1. If a larger value
  is given, only the lower 32 bits are used.

  SRID 0 represents an infinite flat Cartesian plane with no
  units assigned to its axes. To ensure SRID 0 behavior,
  create geometry values using SRID 0. SRID 0 is the default
  for new geometry values if no SRID is specified.

  For computations on multiple geometry values, all values
  must have the same SRID or an error occurs.
- Its **coordinates** in its
  spatial reference system, represented as double-precision
  (8-byte) numbers. All nonempty geometries include at least
  one pair of (X,Y) coordinates. Empty geometries contain no
  coordinates.

  Coordinates are related to the SRID. For example, in
  different coordinate systems, the distance between two
  objects may differ even when objects have the same
  coordinates, because the distance on the
  **planar** coordinate system
  and the distance on the
  **geodetic** system
  (coordinates on the Earth's surface) are different things.
- Its **interior**,
  **boundary**, and
  **exterior**.

  Every geometry occupies some position in space. The
  exterior of a geometry is all space not occupied by the
  geometry. The interior is the space occupied by the
  geometry. The boundary is the interface between the
  geometry's interior and exterior.
- Its **MBR** (minimum bounding
  rectangle), or envelope. This is the bounding geometry,
  formed by the minimum and maximum (X,Y) coordinates:

  ```simple
  ((MINX MINY, MAXX MINY, MAXX MAXY, MINX MAXY, MINX MINY))
  ```
- Whether the value is
  **simple** or
  **nonsimple**. Geometry
  values of types (`LineString`,
  `MultiPoint`,
  `MultiLineString`) are either simple or
  nonsimple. Each type determines its own assertions for
  being simple or nonsimple.
- Whether the value is
  **closed** or
  **not closed**. Geometry
  values of types (`LineString`,
  `MultiString`) are either closed or not
  closed. Each type determines its own assertions for being
  closed or not closed.
- Whether the value is
  **empty** or
  **nonempty** A geometry is
  empty if it does not have any points. Exterior, interior,
  and boundary of an empty geometry are not defined (that
  is, they are represented by a `NULL`
  value). An empty geometry is defined to be always simple
  and has an area of 0.
- Its **dimension**. A geometry
  can have a dimension of −1, 0, 1, or 2:

  - −1 for an empty geometry.
  - 0 for a geometry with no length and no area.
  - 1 for a geometry with nonzero length and zero area.
  - 2 for a geometry with nonzero area.

  `Point` objects have a dimension of zero.
  `LineString` objects have a dimension of
  1. `Polygon` objects have a dimension of
  2. The dimensions of `MultiPoint`,
  `MultiLineString`, and
  `MultiPolygon` objects are the same as
  the dimensions of the elements they consist of.
