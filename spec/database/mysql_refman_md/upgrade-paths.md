## 3.2 Upgrade Paths

- Upgrade from MySQL 5.7 to 8.0 is
  supported. However, upgrade is only supported between General
  Availability (GA) releases. For MySQL 8.0, it is
  required that you upgrade from a MySQL 5.7 GA
  release (5.7.9 or higher). Upgrades from non-GA releases of
  MySQL 5.7 are not supported.
- Upgrading to the latest release is recommended before
  upgrading to the next version. For example, upgrade to the
  latest MySQL 5.7 release before upgrading to
  MySQL 8.0.
- Upgrade that skips versions is not supported. For example,
  upgrading directly from MySQL 5.6 to 8.0 is not
  supported.
- Once a release series reaches General Availability (GA)
  status, upgrade within the release series (from one GA version
  to another GA version) is supported. For example, upgrading
  from MySQL 8.0.*`x`* to
  8.0.*`y`* is supported.
  (Upgrade involving development-status non-GA releases is not
  supported.) Skipping a release is also supported. For example,
  upgrading from MySQL
  8.0.*`x`* to
  8.0.*`z`* is supported.
  MySQL 8.0.11 is the first GA status release within the MySQL
  8.0 release series.
