## 8.8 FIPS Support

MySQL supports FIPS mode when a supported OpenSSL library and FIPS
Object Module are available on the host system.

FIPS mode on the server side applies to cryptographic operations
performed by the server. This includes replication (source/replica
and Group Replication) and X Plugin, which run within the server.
FIPS mode also applies to attempts by clients to connect to the
server.

The following sections describe FIPS mode and how to take
advantage of it within MySQL:

- [FIPS Overview](fips-mode.md#fips-overview "FIPS Overview")
- [System Requirements for FIPS Mode in MySQL](fips-mode.md#fips-system-requirements "System Requirements for FIPS Mode in MySQL")
- [Enabling FIPS Mode in MySQL](fips-mode.md#fips-enabling "Enabling FIPS Mode in MySQL")

### FIPS Overview

Federal Information Processing Standards 140-2 (FIPS 140-2)
describes a security standard that can be required by Federal
(US Government) agencies for cryptographic modules used to
protect sensitive or valuable information. To be considered
acceptable for such Federal use, a cryptographic module must be
certified for FIPS 140-2. If a system intended to protect
sensitive data lacks the proper FIPS 140-2 certificate, Federal
agencies cannot purchase it.

Products such as OpenSSL can be used in FIPS mode, although the
OpenSSL library itself is not validated for FIPS. Instead, the
OpenSSL library is used with the OpenSSL FIPS Object Module to
enable OpenSSL-based applications to operate in FIPS mode.

For general information about FIPS and its implementation in
OpenSSL, these references may be helpful:

  Institute of Standards and Technology FIPS PUB 140-2](https://doi.org/10.6028/NIST.FIPS.140-2)

- [fips\_module
  manual page](https://www.openssl.org/docs/man3.0/man7/fips_module.html)

Important

FIPS mode imposes conditions on cryptographic operations such
as restrictions on acceptable encryption algorithms or
requirements for longer key lengths. For OpenSSL, the exact
FIPS behavior depends on the OpenSSL version.

### System Requirements for FIPS Mode in MySQL

For MySQL to support FIPS mode, these system requirements must
be satisfied:

1. MySQL must be compiled with an OpenSSL version that is
   certified for use with FIPS. OpenSSL 1.0.2 and OpenSSL 3.0
   are certified, but OpenSSL 1.1.1 is not. Binary
   distributions for recent versions of MySQL are compiled
   using OpenSSL 3.0 on some platforms, which means they are
   not certified for FIPS. This means you have the following
   options, depending on system and MySQL configuration:

   - Use a system that has OpenSSL 3.0 and the required FIPS
     object module. In this case, you can enable FIPS mode
     for MySQL if you use a binary distribution compiled
     using OpenSSL 3.0, or compile MySQL from source using
     OpenSSL 3.0.

     For general information about upgrading to OpenSSL 3.0,
     see
     [OpenSSL
     3.0 Migration Guide](https://www.openssl.org/docs/man3.0/man7/migration_guide.html).
   - Use a system that has OpenSSL 1.1.1 or higher. In this
     case, you can install MySQL using binary packages, and
     you can use the TLS v1.3 protocol and ciphersuites, in
     addition to other already supported TLS protocols.
     However, you cannot enable FIPS mode for MySQL.
   - Use a system that has OpenSSL 1.0.2 and the required
     FIPS Object Module. In this case, you can enable FIPS
     mode for MySQL if you use a binary distribution compiled
     using OpenSSL 1.0.2, or compile MySQL from source using
     OpenSSL 1.0.2. In this case, you cannot use the TLS v1.3
     protocol or ciphersuites, which require OpenSSL 1.1.1 or
     3.0. In addition, you should be aware that OpenSSL 1.0.2
     reached end of life status in 2019, and that all
     operating platforms embedding OpenSSL 1.1.1 reach their
     end of life in 2024.
2. At runtime, the OpenSSL library and OpenSSL FIPS Object
   Module must be available as shared (dynamically linked)
   objects.

### Enabling FIPS Mode in MySQL

Note

In MySQL 8.0.34 and later, the server-side and client-side
configuration described at the end of this section is no
longer required.

To determine whether MySQL is running on a system with FIPS mode
enabled, check the value of the
[`ssl_fips_mode`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_ssl_fips_mode) server system
variable using an SQL statement such as
[`SHOW VARIABLES
LIKE '%fips%'`](show-variables.md "15.7.7.41 SHOW VARIABLES Statement") or
[`SELECT
@@ssl_fips_mode`](select.md "15.2.13 SELECT Statement"). If the value of this variable is 1
(`ON`) or 2 (`STRICT`), FIPS
mode is enabled for OpenSSL; if it is 0
(`OFF`), FIPS mode is not available.

Important

In general, `STRICT` imposes more
restrictions than `ON`, but MySQL itself has
no FIPS-specific code other than to specify the FIPS mode
value to OpenSSL. The exact behavior of FIPS mode for
`ON` or `STRICT` depends on
the OpenSSL version. For details, refer to the
`fips_module` manpage (see
[FIPS Overview](fips-mode.md#fips-overview "FIPS Overview")).

FIPS mode on the server side applies to cryptographic operations
performed by the server, including those performed by MySQL
Replication (including Group Replication) and X Plugin, which
run within the server.

FIPS mode also applies to attempts by clients to connect to the
server. When enabled, on either the client or server side, it
restricts which of the supported encryption ciphers can be
chosen. However, enabling FIPS mode does not require that an
encrypted connection must be used, or that user credentials must
be encrypted. For example, if FIPS mode is enabled, stronger
cryptographic algorithms are required. In particular, MD5 is
restricted, so trying to establish an encrypted connection using
an encryption cipher such as `RC4-MD5` does not
work. But there is nothing about FIPS mode that prevents
establishing an unencrypted connection. (To do that, you can use
the `REQUIRE` clause for
[`CREATE USER`](create-user.md "15.7.1.3 CREATE USER Statement") or
[`ALTER USER`](alter-user.md "15.7.1.1 ALTER USER Statement") for specific user
accounts, or set the
[`require_secure_transport`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_require_secure_transport) system
variable to affect all accounts.)

If FIPS mode is required, it is recommended to use an operating
platform that includes it; if it does, you can (and should) use
it. If your platform does not include FIPS, you have two
options:

- Migrate to a platform which has FIPS OpenSSL support.
- Build the OpenSSL library and FIPS object module from
  source, using the instructions from
  the `fips_module` manpage
  (see [FIPS Overview](fips-mode.md#fips-overview "FIPS Overview")).

**MySQL 8.0.34 and earlier**:
Control of FIPS mode on the server side and the client side was
accomplished using the system variables listed here:

- The [`ssl_fips_mode`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_ssl_fips_mode) system
  variable controls whether the server operates in FIPS mode.
- The [`--ssl-fips-mode`](connection-options.md#option_general_ssl-fips-mode) client
  option controls whether a given MySQL client operates in
  FIPS mode.

The [`ssl_fips_mode`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_ssl_fips_mode) system
variable and [`--ssl-fips-mode`](connection-options.md#option_general_ssl-fips-mode)
client option permit these values:

- `OFF`: Disable FIPS mode.
- `ON`: Enable FIPS mode.
- `STRICT`: Enable “strict” FIPS
  mode.

Note

If the OpenSSL FIPS Object Module is not available, the only
permitted value for
[`ssl_fips_mode`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_ssl_fips_mode) and
[`--ssl-fips-mode`](connection-options.md#option_general_ssl-fips-mode) is
`OFF`. An error occurs for attempts to set
the FIPS mode to a different value.
