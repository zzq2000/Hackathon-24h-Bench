#### 25.6.16.9 The ndbinfo config\_nodes Table

The `config_nodes` table shows nodes configured
in an NDB Cluster `config.ini` file. For each
node, the table displays a row containing the node ID, the type
of node (management node, data node, or API node), and the name
or IP address of the host on which the node is configured to
run.

This table does not indicate whether a given node is actually
running, or whether it is currently connected to the cluster.
Information about nodes connected to an NDB Cluster can be
obtained from the [`nodes`](mysql-cluster-ndbinfo-nodes.md "25.6.16.47 The ndbinfo nodes Table") and
[`processes`](mysql-cluster-ndbinfo-processes.md "25.6.16.50 The ndbinfo processes Table") table.

The `config_nodes` table contains the following
columns:

- `node_id`

  The node's ID
- `node_type`

  The type of node
- `node_hostname`

  The name or IP address of the host on which the node resides

##### Notes

The `node_id` column shows the node ID used in
the `config.ini` file for this node; if none
is specified, the node ID that would be assigned automatically
to this node is displayed.

The `node_type` column displays one of the
following three values:

- `MGM`: Management node.
- `NDB`: Data node.
- `API`: API node; this includes SQL nodes.

The `node_hostname` column shows the node host
as specified in the `config.ini` file. This
can be empty for an API node, if
[`HostName`](mysql-cluster-api-definition.md#ndbparam-api-hostname) has not been set
in the cluster configuration file. If
[`HostName`](mysql-cluster-ndbd-definition.md#ndbparam-ndbd-hostname) has not been
set for a data node in the configuration file,
`localhost` is used here.
`localhost` is also used if
[`HostName`](mysql-cluster-mgm-definition.md#ndbparam-mgmd-hostname) has not been
specified for a management node.
