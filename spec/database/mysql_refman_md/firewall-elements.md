#### 8.4.7.1 Elements of MySQL Enterprise Firewall

MySQL Enterprise Firewall is based on a plugin library that includes these
elements:

- A server-side plugin named `MYSQL_FIREWALL`
  examines SQL statements before they execute and, based on
  the registered firewall profiles, renders a decision whether
  to execute or reject each statement.
- The `MYSQL_FIREWALL` plugin, along with
  server-side plugins named
  `MYSQL_FIREWALL_USERS` and
  `MYSQL_FIREWALL_WHITELIST` implement
  Performance Schema and `INFORMATION_SCHEMA`
  tables that provide views into the registered profiles.
- Profiles are cached in memory for better performance. Tables
  in the `mysql` system database provide
  backing storage of firewall data for persistence of profiles
  across server restarts.
- Stored procedures perform tasks such as registering firewall
  profiles, establishing their operational mode, and managing
  transfer of firewall data between the cache and persistent
  storage.
- Administrative functions provide an API for lower-level
  tasks such as synchronizing the cache with persistent
  storage.
- System variables enable firewall configuration and status
  variables provide runtime operational information.
- The [`FIREWALL_ADMIN`](privileges-provided.md#priv_firewall-admin) and
  [`FIREWALL_USER`](privileges-provided.md#priv_firewall-user) privileges
  enable users to administer firewall rules for any user, and
  their own firewall rules, respectively.
- The [`FIREWALL_EXEMPT`](privileges-provided.md#priv_firewall-exempt) privilege
  (available as of MySQL 8.0.27) exempts a user from firewall
  restrictions. This is useful, for example, for any database
  administrator who configures the firewall, to avoid the
  possibility of a misconfiguration causing even the
  administrator to be locked out and unable to execute
  statements.
