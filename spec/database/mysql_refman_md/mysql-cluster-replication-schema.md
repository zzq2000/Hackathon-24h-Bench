### 25.7.4 NDB Cluster Replication Schema and Tables

- [ndb\_apply\_status Table](mysql-cluster-replication-schema.md#ndb-replication-ndb-apply-status "ndb_apply_status Table")
- [ndb\_binlog\_index Table](mysql-cluster-replication-schema.md#ndb-replication-ndb-binlog-index "ndb_binlog_index Table")
- [ndb\_replication Table](mysql-cluster-replication-schema.md#ndb-replication-ndb-replication "ndb_replication Table")

Replication in NDB Cluster makes use of a number of dedicated
tables in the `mysql` database on each MySQL
Server instance acting as an SQL node in both the cluster being
replicated and in the replica. This is true regardless of whether
the replica is a single server or a cluster.

The `ndb_binlog_index` and
`ndb_apply_status` tables are created in the
`mysql` database. They should not be explicitly
replicated by the user. User intervention is normally not required
to create or maintain either of these tables, since both are
maintained by the [`NDB`](mysql-cluster.md "Chapter 25 MySQL NDB Cluster 8.0") binary log
(binlog) injector thread. This keeps the source
[**mysqld**](mysqld.md "6.3.1 mysqld — The MySQL Server") process updated to changes performed by
the [`NDB`](mysql-cluster.md "Chapter 25 MySQL NDB Cluster 8.0") storage engine. The
[`NDB`](mysql-cluster.md "Chapter 25 MySQL NDB Cluster 8.0") binlog
injector thread receives events directly from the
[`NDB`](mysql-cluster.md "Chapter 25 MySQL NDB Cluster 8.0") storage engine. The
[`NDB`](mysql-cluster.md "Chapter 25 MySQL NDB Cluster 8.0") injector is responsible for
capturing all the data events within the cluster, and ensures that
all events which change, insert, or delete data are recorded in
the `ndb_binlog_index` table. The replica I/O
(receiver) thread transfers the events from the source's
binary log to the replica's relay log.

The `ndb_replication` table must be created
manually. This table can be updated by the user to perform
filtering by database or table. See
[ndb\_replication Table](mysql-cluster-replication-schema.md#ndb-replication-ndb-replication "ndb_replication Table"), for more
information. `ndb_replication` is also used in
NDB Replication conflict detection and resolution for conflict
resolution control; see
[Conflict Resolution Control](mysql-cluster-replication-conflict-resolution.md#conflict-resolution-control "Conflict Resolution Control").

Even though `ndb_binlog_index` and
`ndb_apply_status` are created and maintained
automatically, it is advisable to check for the existence and
integrity of these tables as an initial step in preparing an NDB
Cluster for replication. It is possible to view event data
recorded in the binary log by querying the
`mysql.ndb_binlog_index` table directly on the
source. This can be also be accomplished using the
[`SHOW BINLOG EVENTS`](show-binlog-events.md "15.7.7.2 SHOW BINLOG EVENTS Statement") statement on
either the source or replica SQL node. (See
[Section 15.7.7.2, “SHOW BINLOG EVENTS Statement”](show-binlog-events.md "15.7.7.2 SHOW BINLOG EVENTS Statement").)

You can also obtain useful information from the output of
[`SHOW ENGINE NDB
STATUS`](show-engine.md "15.7.7.15 SHOW ENGINE Statement").

Note

When performing schema changes on
[`NDB`](mysql-cluster.md "Chapter 25 MySQL NDB Cluster 8.0") tables, applications should
wait until the [`ALTER TABLE`](alter-table.md "15.1.9 ALTER TABLE Statement")
statement has returned in the MySQL client connection that
issued the statement before attempting to use the updated
definition of the table.

#### ndb\_apply\_status Table

`ndb_apply_status` is used to keep a record of
the operations that have been replicated from the source to the
replica. If the `ndb_apply_status` table does
not exist on the replica, [**ndb\_restore**](mysql-cluster-programs-ndb-restore.md "25.5.23 ndb_restore — Restore an NDB Cluster Backup")
re-creates it.

Unlike the case with `ndb_binlog_index`, the
data in this table is not specific to any one SQL node in the
(replica) cluster, and so `ndb_apply_status`
can use the `NDBCLUSTER` storage engine, as
shown here:

```sql
CREATE TABLE `ndb_apply_status` (
    `server_id`   INT(10) UNSIGNED NOT NULL,
    `epoch`       BIGINT(20) UNSIGNED NOT NULL,
    `log_name`    VARCHAR(255) CHARACTER SET latin1 COLLATE latin1_bin NOT NULL,
    `start_pos`   BIGINT(20) UNSIGNED NOT NULL,
    `end_pos`     BIGINT(20) UNSIGNED NOT NULL,
    PRIMARY KEY (`server_id`) USING HASH
) ENGINE=NDBCLUSTER DEFAULT CHARSET=utf8mb4 COLLATE=utf8mb4_0900_ai_ci;
```

The `ndb_apply_status` table is populated only
on replicas, which means that, on the source, this table never
contains any rows; thus, there is no need to allot any
[`DataMemory`](mysql-cluster-ndbd-definition.md#ndbparam-ndbd-datamemory) to
`ndb_apply_status` there.

Because this table is populated from data originating on the
source, it should be allowed to replicate; any replication
filtering or binary log filtering rules that inadvertently
prevent the replica from updating
`ndb_apply_status`, or that prevent the source
from writing into the binary log may prevent replication between
clusters from operating properly. For more information about
potential problems arising from such filtering rules, see
[Replication and binary log filtering rules with replication between NDB
Clusters](mysql-cluster-replication-issues.md#mysql-cluster-replication-issues-filtering "Replication and binary log filtering rules with replication between NDB Clusters").

It is possible to delete this table, but this is not
recommended. Deleting it puts all SQL nodes in read-only mode;
in NDB 8.0.24 and later, `NDB` detects that
this table has been dropped, and re-creates it, after which it
is possible once again to perform updates. Dropping and
re-creating `ndb_apply_status` creates a gap
event in the binary log; the gap event causes replica SQL nodes
to stop applying changes from the source until the replication
channel is restarted. Prior to NDB 8.0.24, it was necessary in
such cases to restart all SQL nodes to bring them out of
read-only mode, and then to re-create
`ndb_apply_status` manually.

`0` in the `epoch` column of
this table indicates a transaction originating from a storage
engine other than `NDB`.

`ndb_apply_status` is used to record which
epoch transactions have been replicated and applied to a replica
cluster from an upstream source. This information is captured in
an `NDB` online backup, but (by design) it is
not restored by [**ndb\_restore**](mysql-cluster-programs-ndb-restore.md "25.5.23 ndb_restore — Restore an NDB Cluster Backup"). In some cases,
it can be helpful to restore this information for use in new
setups; beginning with NDB 8.0.29, you can do this by invoking
[**ndb\_restore**](mysql-cluster-programs-ndb-restore.md "25.5.23 ndb_restore — Restore an NDB Cluster Backup") with the
[`--with-apply-status`](mysql-cluster-programs-ndb-restore.md#option_ndb_restore_with-apply-status) option.
See the description of the option for more information.

#### ndb\_binlog\_index Table

NDB Cluster Replication uses the
`ndb_binlog_index` table for storing the binary
log's indexing data. Since this table is local to each
MySQL server and does not participate in clustering, it uses the
[`InnoDB`](innodb-storage-engine.md "Chapter 17 The InnoDB Storage Engine") storage engine. This means
that it must be created separately on each
[**mysqld**](mysqld.md "6.3.1 mysqld — The MySQL Server") participating in the source cluster.
(The binary log itself contains updates from all MySQL servers
in the cluster.) This table is defined as follows:

```sql
CREATE TABLE `ndb_binlog_index` (
    `Position` BIGINT(20) UNSIGNED NOT NULL,
    `File` VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    `epoch` BIGINT(20) UNSIGNED NOT NULL,
    `inserts` INT(10) UNSIGNED NOT NULL,
    `updates` INT(10) UNSIGNED NOT NULL,
    `deletes` INT(10) UNSIGNED NOT NULL,
    `schemaops` INT(10) UNSIGNED NOT NULL,
    `orig_server_id` INT(10) UNSIGNED NOT NULL,
    `orig_epoch` BIGINT(20) UNSIGNED NOT NULL,
    `gci` INT(10) UNSIGNED NOT NULL,
    `next_position` bigint(20) unsigned NOT NULL,
    `next_file` varchar(255) NOT NULL,
    PRIMARY KEY (`epoch`,`orig_server_id`,`orig_epoch`)
) ENGINE=InnoDB DEFAULT CHARSET=utf8mb4 COLLATE=utf8mb4_0900_ai_ci;
```

Note

If you are upgrading from an older release (prior to NDB
7.5.2), perform the MySQL upgrade procedure and ensure that
the system tables are upgraded by starting the MySQL server
with the `--upgrade=FORCE` option. The system
table upgrade causes an
[`ALTER TABLE ...
ENGINE=INNODB`](alter-table.md "15.1.9 ALTER TABLE Statement") statement to be executed for this
table. Use of the `MyISAM` storage engine for
this table continues to be supported for backward
compatibility.

`ndb_binlog_index` may require additional
disk space after being converted to `InnoDB`.
If this becomes an issue, you may be able to conserve space by
using an `InnoDB` tablespace for this table,
changing its `ROW_FORMAT` to
`COMPRESSED`, or both. For more information,
see [Section 15.1.21, “CREATE TABLESPACE Statement”](create-tablespace.md "15.1.21 CREATE TABLESPACE Statement"), and
[Section 15.1.20, “CREATE TABLE Statement”](create-table.md "15.1.20 CREATE TABLE Statement"), as well as
[Section 17.6.3, “Tablespaces”](innodb-tablespace.md "17.6.3 Tablespaces").

The size of the `ndb_binlog_index` table is
dependent on the number of epochs per binary log file and the
number of binary log files. The number of epochs per binary log
file normally depends on the amount of binary log generated per
epoch and the size of the binary log file, with smaller epochs
resulting in more epochs per file. You should be aware that
empty epochs produce inserts to the
`ndb_binlog_index` table, even when the
[`--ndb-log-empty-epochs`](mysql-cluster-options-variables.md#option_mysqld_ndb-log-empty-epochs) option is
`OFF`, meaning that the number of entries per
file depends on the length of time that the file is in use; this
relationship can be represented by the formula shown here:

```simple
[number of epochs per file] = [time spent per file] / TimeBetweenEpochs
```

A busy NDB Cluster writes to the binary log regularly and
presumably rotates binary log files more quickly than a quiet
one. This means that a “quiet” NDB Cluster with
[`--ndb-log-empty-epochs=ON`](mysql-cluster-options-variables.md#option_mysqld_ndb-log-empty-epochs) can
actually have a much higher number of
`ndb_binlog_index` rows per file than one with
a great deal of activity.

When [**mysqld**](mysqld.md "6.3.1 mysqld — The MySQL Server") is started with the
[`--ndb-log-orig`](mysql-cluster-options-variables.md#option_mysqld_ndb-log-orig) option, the
`orig_server_id` and
`orig_epoch` columns store, respectively, the
ID of the server on which the event originated and the epoch in
which the event took place on the originating server, which is
useful in NDB Cluster replication setups employing multiple
sources. The [`SELECT`](select.md "15.2.13 SELECT Statement") statement
used to find the closest binary log position to the highest
applied epoch on the replica in a multi-source setup (see
[Section 25.7.10, “NDB Cluster Replication: Bidirectional and Circular Replication”](mysql-cluster-replication-multi-source.md "25.7.10 NDB Cluster Replication: Bidirectional and Circular Replication"))
employs these two columns, which are not indexed. This can lead
to performance issues when trying to fail over, since the query
must perform a table scan, especially when the source has been
running with
[`--ndb-log-empty-epochs=ON`](mysql-cluster-options-variables.md#option_mysqld_ndb-log-empty-epochs). You
can improve multi-source failover times by adding an index to
these columns, as shown here:

```sql
ALTER TABLE mysql.ndb_binlog_index
    ADD INDEX orig_lookup USING BTREE (orig_server_id, orig_epoch);
```

Adding this index provides no benefit when replicating from a
single source to a single replica, since the query used to get
the binary log position in such cases makes no use of
`orig_server_id` or
`orig_epoch`.

See [Section 25.7.8, “Implementing Failover with NDB Cluster Replication”](mysql-cluster-replication-failover.md "25.7.8 Implementing Failover with NDB Cluster Replication"), for
more information about using the
`next_position` and
`next_file` columns.

The following figure shows the relationship of the NDB Cluster
replication source server, its binary log injector thread, and
the `mysql.ndb_binlog_index` table.

**Figure 25.14 The Replication Source Cluster**

![Most concepts are described in the surrounding text. This complex image has three main areas. The top left area is divided into three sections: MySQL Server (mysqld), NDBCLUSTER table handler, and mutex. A connection thread connects these, and receiver and injector threads connect the NDBCLUSTER table handler and mutex. The bottom area shows four data nodes (ndbd). They all produce events represented by arrows pointing to the receiver thread, and the receiver thread also points to the connection and injector threads. One node sends and receives to the mutex area. The arrow representing the injector thread points to a binary log as well as the ndb_binlog_index table, which is described in the surrounding text.](images/cluster-replication-binlog-injector.png)

#### ndb\_replication Table

The `ndb_replication` table is used to control
binary logging and conflict resolution, and acts on a per-table
basis. Each row in this table corresponds to a table being
replicated, determines how to log changes to the table and, if a
conflict resolution function is specified, and determines how to
resolve conflicts for that table.

Unlike the `ndb_apply_status` and
`ndb_replication` tables, the
`ndb_replication` table must be created
manually, using the SQL statement shown here:

```sql
CREATE TABLE mysql.ndb_replication  (
    db VARBINARY(63),
    table_name VARBINARY(63),
    server_id INT UNSIGNED,
    binlog_type INT UNSIGNED,
    conflict_fn VARBINARY(128),
    PRIMARY KEY USING HASH (db, table_name, server_id)
)   ENGINE=NDB
PARTITION BY KEY(db,table_name);
```

The columns of this table are listed here, with descriptions:

- `db` column

  The name of the database containing the table to be
  replicated.

  You may employ either or both of the wildcards
  `_` and `%` as part of the
  database name. (See
  [Matching with wildcards](mysql-cluster-replication-schema.md#ndb-replication-wildcards "Matching with wildcards"), later in this
  section.)
- `table_name` column

  The name of the table to be replicated.

  The table name may include either or both of the wildcards
  `_` and `%`. See
  [Matching with wildcards](mysql-cluster-replication-schema.md#ndb-replication-wildcards "Matching with wildcards"), later in this
  section.
- `server_id` column

  The unique server ID of the MySQL instance (SQL node) where
  the table resides.

  `0` in this column acts like a wildcard
  equivalent to `%`, and matches any server
  ID. (See [Matching with wildcards](mysql-cluster-replication-schema.md#ndb-replication-wildcards "Matching with wildcards"), later
  in this section.)
- `binlog_type` column

  The type of binary logging to be employed. See text for
  values and descriptions.
- `conflict_fn` column

  The conflict resolution function to be applied; one of
  [NDB$OLD()](mysql-cluster-replication-conflict-resolution.md#mysql-cluster-replication-ndb-old "NDB$OLD()"),
  [NDB$MAX()](mysql-cluster-replication-conflict-resolution.md#mysql-cluster-replication-ndb-max "NDB$MAX()"),
  [NDB$MAX\_DELETE\_WIN()](mysql-cluster-replication-conflict-resolution.md#mysql-cluster-replication-ndb-max-delete-win "NDB$MAX_DELETE_WIN()"),
  [NDB$EPOCH()](mysql-cluster-replication-conflict-resolution.md#mysql-cluster-replication-ndb-epoch "NDB$EPOCH()"),
  [NDB$EPOCH\_TRANS()](mysql-cluster-replication-conflict-resolution.md#mysql-cluster-replication-ndb-epoch-trans "NDB$EPOCH_TRANS()"),
  [NDB$EPOCH2()](mysql-cluster-replication-conflict-resolution.md#mysql-cluster-replication-ndb-epoch2 "NDB$EPOCH2()"),
  [NDB$EPOCH2\_TRANS()](mysql-cluster-replication-conflict-resolution.md#mysql-cluster-replication-ndb-epoch2-trans "NDB$EPOCH2_TRANS()");
  `NULL` indicates that conflict resolution
  is not used for this table. NDB 8.0.30 and later supports
  two additional conflict resolution functions
  [NDB$MAX\_INS()](mysql-cluster-replication-conflict-resolution.md#mysql-cluster-replication-ndb-max-ins "NDB$MAX_INS()") and
  [NDB$MAX\_DEL\_WIN\_INS()](mysql-cluster-replication-conflict-resolution.md#mysql-cluster-replication-ndb-max-del-win-ins "NDB$MAX_DEL_WIN_INS()").

  See [Conflict Resolution Functions](mysql-cluster-replication-conflict-resolution.md#conflict-resolution-functions "Conflict Resolution Functions"), for
  more information about these functions and their uses in NDB
  Replication conflict resolution.

  Some conflict resolution functions
  (`NDB$OLD()`,
  `NDB$EPOCH()`,
  `NDB$EPOCH_TRANS()`) require the use of one
  or more user-created exceptions tables. See
  [Conflict Resolution Exceptions Table](mysql-cluster-replication-conflict-resolution.md#conflict-resolution-exceptions-table "Conflict Resolution Exceptions Table").

To enable conflict resolution with NDB Replication, it is
necessary to create and populate this table with control
information on the SQL node or nodes on which the conflict
should be resolved. Depending on the conflict resolution type
and method to be employed, this may be the source, the replica,
or both servers. In a simple source-replica setup where data can
also be changed locally on the replica this is typically the
replica. In a more complex replication scheme, such as
bidirectional replication, this is usually all of the sources
involved. See
[Section 25.7.12, “NDB Cluster Replication Conflict Resolution”](mysql-cluster-replication-conflict-resolution.md "25.7.12 NDB Cluster Replication Conflict Resolution"),
for more information.

The `ndb_replication` table allows table-level
control over binary logging outside the scope of conflict
resolution, in which case `conflict_fn` is
specified as `NULL`, while the remaining column
values are used to control binary logging for a given table or
set of tables matching a wildcard expression. By setting the
proper value for the `binlog_type` column, you
can make logging for a given table or tables use a desired
binary log format, or disabling binary logging altogether.
Possible values for this column, with
values and descriptions, are shown in the following table:

**Table 25.70 binlog\_type values, with values and descriptions**

| Value | Description |
| --- | --- |
| 0 | Use server default |
| 1 | Do not log this table in the binary log (same effect as [`sql_log_bin = 0`](replication-options-binary-log.md#sysvar_sql_log_bin), but applies to one or more specified tables only) |
| 2 | Log updated attributes only; log these as `WRITE_ROW` events |
| 3 | Log full row, even if not updated (MySQL server default behavior) |
| 6 | Use updated attributes, even if values are unchanged |
| 7 | Log full row, even if no values are changed; log updates as `UPDATE_ROW` events |
| 8 | Log update as `UPDATE_ROW`; log only primary key columns in before image, and only updated columns in after image (same effect as [`--ndb-log-update-minimal`](mysql-cluster-options-variables.md#option_mysqld_ndb-log-update-minimal), but applies to one or more specified tables only) |
| 9 | Log update as `UPDATE_ROW`; log only primary key columns in before image, and all columns other than primary key columns in after image |

Note

`binlog_type` values 4 and 5 are not used,
and so are omitted from the table just shown, as well as from
the next table.

Several `binlog_type` values are equivalent to
various combinations of the [**mysqld**](mysqld.md "6.3.1 mysqld — The MySQL Server") logging
options [`--ndb-log-updated-only`](mysql-cluster-options-variables.md#option_mysqld_ndb-log-updated-only),
[`--ndb-log-update-as-write`](mysql-cluster-options-variables.md#option_mysqld_ndb-log-update-as-write), and
[`--ndb-log-update-minimal`](mysql-cluster-options-variables.md#option_mysqld_ndb-log-update-minimal), as
shown in the following table:

**Table 25.71 binlog\_type values with equivalent combinations of NDB logging options**

| Value | `--ndb-log-updated-only` Value | `--ndb-log-update-as-write` Value | `--ndb-log-update-minimal` Value |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 0 | -- | -- | -- |
| 1 | -- | -- | -- |
| 2 | ON | ON | OFF |
| 3 | OFF | ON | OFF |
| 6 | ON | OFF | OFF |
| 7 | OFF | OFF | OFF |
| 8 | ON | OFF | ON |
| 9 | OFF | OFF | ON |

Binary logging can be set to different formats for different
tables by inserting rows into the
`ndb_replication` table using the appropriate
`db`, `table_name`, and
`binlog_type` column values. The internal
integer value shown in the preceding table should be used when
setting the binary logging format. The following two statements
set binary logging to logging of full rows (
value 3) for table `test.a`, and to logging of
updates only (
value 2) for table `test.b`:

```sql
# Table test.a: Log full rows
INSERT INTO mysql.ndb_replication VALUES("test", "a", 0, 3, NULL);

# Table test.b: log updates only
INSERT INTO mysql.ndb_replication VALUES("test", "b", 0, 2, NULL);
```

To disable logging for one or more tables, use 1
for `binlog_type`, as shown here:

```sql
# Disable binary logging for table test.t1
INSERT INTO mysql.ndb_replication VALUES("test", "t1", 0, 1, NULL);

# Disable binary logging for any table in 'test' whose name begins with 't'
INSERT INTO mysql.ndb_replication VALUES("test", "t%", 0, 1, NULL);
```

Disabling logging
for a given table is the equivalent of setting
[`sql_log_bin = 0`](replication-options-binary-log.md#sysvar_sql_log_bin), except that it
applies to one or more tables individually.
If an SQL node is not performing binary logging for a given
table, it is not sent the row change events for those tables.
This means that it is not receiving all changes and discarding
some, but rather it is not subscribing to these changes.

Disabling logging
can be useful for a number of reasons, including those listed
here:

- Not sending changes across the network generally saves
  bandwidth, buffering, and CPU resources.
- Not logging changes to tables with very frequent updates but
  whose value is not great is a good fit for transient data
  (such as session data) that may be relatively unimportant in
  the event of a complete failure of the cluster.
- Using a session variable (or `sql_log_bin`)
  and application code, it is also possible to log (or not to
  log) certain SQL statements or types of SQL statements; for
  example, it may be desirable in some cases not to record DDL
  statements on one or more tables.
- Splitting replication streams into two (or more) binary logs
  can be done for reasons of performance, a need to replicate
  different databases to different places, use of different
  binary logging types for different databases, and so on.

**Matching with wildcards.**
In order not to make it necessary to insert a row in the
`ndb_replication` table for each and every
combination of database, table, and SQL node in your
replication setup, `NDB` supports wildcard
matching on the this table's `db`,
`table_name`, and
`server_id` columns. Database and table names
used in, respectively, `db` and
`table_name` may contain either or both of
the following wildcards:

- `_` (underscore character): matches zero or
  more characters
- `%` (percent sign): matches a single
  character

(These are the same wildcards as supported by the MySQL
[`LIKE`](string-comparison-functions.md#operator_like) operator.)

The `server_id` column supports
`0` as a wildcard equivalent to
`_` (matches anything). This is used in the
examples shown previously.

A given row in the `ndb_replication` table can
use wildcards to match any of the database name, table name, and
server ID in any combination. Where there are multiple potential
matches in the table, the best match is chosen, according to the
table shown here, where *W* represents a
wildcard match, *E* an exact match, and the
greater the value in the *Quality* column,
the better the match:

**Table 25.72
Weights of different combinations of wildcard and
exact matches on columns in the mysql.ndb\_replication
table**

| `db` | `table_name` | `server_id` | Quality |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| W | W | W | 1 |
| W | W | E | 2 |
| W | E | W | 3 |
| W | E | E | 4 |
| E | W | W | 5 |
| E | W | E | 6 |
| E | E | W | 7 |
| E | E | E | 8 |

Thus, an exact match on database name, table name, and server ID
is considered best (strongest), while the weakest (worst) match
is a wildcard match on all three columns. Only the strength of
the match is considered when choosing which rule to apply; the
order in which the rows occur in the table has no effect on this
determination.

**Logging Full or Partial Rows.**

There are two basic methods of logging rows, as determined by
the setting of the
[`--ndb-log-updated-only`](mysql-cluster-options-variables.md#option_mysqld_ndb-log-updated-only) option
for [**mysqld**](mysqld.md "6.3.1 mysqld — The MySQL Server"):

- Log complete rows (option set to `ON`)
- Log only column data that has been updated—that is,
  column data whose value has been set, regardless of whether
  or not this value was actually changed. This is the default
  behavior (option set to `OFF`).

It is usually sufficient—and more efficient—to log
updated columns only; however, if you need to log full rows, you
can do so by setting
[`--ndb-log-updated-only`](mysql-cluster-options-variables.md#option_mysqld_ndb-log-updated-only) to
`0` or `OFF`.

**Logging Changed Data as Updates.**

The setting of the MySQL Server's
[`--ndb-log-update-as-write`](mysql-cluster-options-variables.md#option_mysqld_ndb-log-update-as-write)
option determines whether logging is performed with or without
the “before” image.

Because conflict resolution for updates and delete operations is
done in the MySQL Server's update handler, it is necessary
to control the logging performed by the replication source such
that updates are updates and not writes; that is, such that
updates are treated as changes in existing rows rather than the
writing of new rows, even though these replace existing rows.

This option is turned on by default; in other words, updates are
treated as writes. That is, updates are by default written as
`write_row` events in the binary log, rather
than as `update_row` events.

To disable the option, start the source
[**mysqld**](mysqld.md "6.3.1 mysqld — The MySQL Server") with
`--ndb-log-update-as-write=0` or
`--ndb-log-update-as-write=OFF`. You must do this
when replicating from NDB tables to tables using a different
storage engine; see
[Replication from NDB to other storage engines](mysql-cluster-replication-issues.md#mysql-cluster-replication-ndb-to-non-ndb "Replication from NDB to other storage engines"), and
[Replication from NDB to a nontransactional storage engine](mysql-cluster-replication-issues.md#mysql-cluster-replication-ndb-to-nontransactional "Replication from NDB to a nontransactional storage engine"),
for more information.

conflict resolution using `NDB$MAX_INS()` or
`NDB$MAX_DEL_WIN_INS()`, an SQL node (that
is, a [**mysqld**](mysqld.md "6.3.1 mysqld — The MySQL Server") process) can record row
updates on the source cluster as `WRITE_ROW`
events with the
[`--ndb-log-update-as-write`](mysql-cluster-options-variables.md#option_mysqld_ndb-log-update-as-write)
option enabled for idempotency and optimal size. This works
for these algorithms since they both map a
`WRITE_ROW` event to an insert or update
depending on whether the row already exists, and the required
metadata (the “after” image for the timestamp
column) is present in the “WRITE\_ROW” event.
