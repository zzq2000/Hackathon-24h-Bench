#### 25.6.16.60 The ndbinfo tc\_time\_track\_stats Table

The `tc_time_track_stats` table provides
time-tracking information obtained from the
[`DBTC`](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/ndb-internals/en/ndb-internals-kernel-blocks-dbtc.html) block (TC) instances in
the data nodes, through API nodes access `NDB`.
Each TC instance tracks latencies for a set of activities it
undertakes on behalf of API nodes or other data nodes; these
activities include transactions, transaction errors, key reads,
key writes, unique index operations, failed key operations of
any type, scans, failed scans, fragment scans, and failed
fragment scans.

A set of counters is maintained for each activity, each counter
covering a range of latencies less than or equal to an upper
bound. At the conclusion of each activity, its latency is
determined and the appropriate counter incremented.
`tc_time_track_stats` presents this information
as rows, with a row for each instance of the following:

- Data node, using its ID
- TC block instance
- Other communicating data node or API node, using its ID
- Upper bound value

Each row contains a value for each activity type. This is the
number of times that this activity occurred with a latency
within the range specified by the row (that is, where the
latency does not exceed the upper bound).

The `tc_time_track_stats` table contains the
following columns:

- `node_id`

  Requesting node ID
- `block_number`

  TC block number
- `block_instance`

  TC block instance number
- `comm_node_id`

  Node ID of communicating API or data node
- `upper_bound`

  Upper bound of interval (in microseconds)
- `scans`

  Based on duration of successful scans from opening to
  closing, tracked against the API or data nodes requesting
  them.
- `scan_errors`

  Based on duration of failed scans from opening to closing,
  tracked against the API or data nodes requesting them.
- `scan_fragments`

  Based on duration of successful fragment scans from opening
  to closing, tracked against the data nodes executing them
- `scan_fragment_errors`

  Based on duration of failed fragment scans from opening to
  closing, tracked against the data nodes executing them
- `transactions`

  Based on duration of successful transactions from beginning
  until sending of commit `ACK`, tracked
  against the API or data nodes requesting them. Stateless
  transactions are not included.
- `transaction_errors`

  Based on duration of failing transactions from start to
  point of failure, tracked against the API or data nodes
  requesting them.
- `read_key_ops`

  Based on duration of successful primary key reads with
  locks. Tracked against both the API or data node requesting
  them and the data node executing them.
- `write_key_ops`

  Based on duration of successful primary key writes, tracked
  against both the API or data node requesting them and the
  data node executing them.
- `index_key_ops`

  Based on duration of successful unique index key operations,
  tracked against both the API or data node requesting them
  and the data node executing reads of base tables.
- `key_op_errors`

  Based on duration of all unsuccessful key read or write
  operations, tracked against both the API or data node
  requesting them and the data node executing them.

##### Notes

The `block_instance` column provides the
[`DBTC`](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/ndb-internals/en/ndb-internals-kernel-blocks-dbtc.html) kernel block instance
number. You can use this together with the block name to obtain
information about specific threads from the
[`threadblocks`](mysql-cluster-ndbinfo-threadblocks.md "25.6.16.61 The ndbinfo threadblocks Table") table.
