To protect against unauthorized access to data that is stored on and
transferred between replication source servers and replicas, set up
all the servers involved using the security measures that you would
choose for any MySQL instance in your installation, as described in
[Chapter 8, *Security*](security.md "Chapter 8 Security"). In addition, for servers in a
replication topology, consider implementing the following security
measures:

- Set up sources and replicas to use encrypted connections to
  transfer the binary log, which protects this data in motion.
  Encryption for these connections must be activated using a
  [`CHANGE REPLICATION SOURCE TO`](change-replication-source-to.md "15.4.2.3 CHANGE REPLICATION SOURCE TO Statement") |
  [`CHANGE MASTER TO`](change-master-to.md "15.4.2.1 CHANGE MASTER TO Statement") statement, in
  addition to setting up the servers to support encrypted network
  connections. See
  [Section 19.3.1, “Setting Up Replication to Use Encrypted Connections”](replication-encrypted-connections.md "19.3.1 Setting Up Replication to Use Encrypted Connections").
- Encrypt the binary log files and relay log files on sources and
  replicas, which protects this data at rest, and also any data in
  use in the binary log cache. Binary log encryption is activated
  using the [`binlog_encryption`](replication-options-binary-log.md#sysvar_binlog_encryption)
  system variable. See
  [Section 19.3.2, “Encrypting Binary Log Files and Relay Log Files”](replication-binlog-encryption.md "19.3.2 Encrypting Binary Log Files and Relay Log Files").
- Apply privilege checks to replication appliers, which help to
  secure replication channels against the unauthorized or
  accidental use of privileged or unwanted operations. Privilege
  checks are implemented by setting up a
  `PRIVILEGE_CHECKS_USER` account, which MySQL
  uses to verify that you have authorized each specific
  transaction for that channel. See
  [Section 19.3.3, “Replication Privilege Checks”](replication-privilege-checks.md "19.3.3 Replication Privilege Checks").

For Group Replication, binary log encryption and privilege checks
can be used as a security measure on replication group members. You
should also consider encrypting the connections between group
members, comprising group communication connections and distributed
recovery connections, and applying IP address allowlisting to
exclude untrusted hosts. For information on these security measures
specific to Group Replication, see
[Section 20.6, “Group Replication Security”](group-replication-security.md "20.6 Group Replication Security").
