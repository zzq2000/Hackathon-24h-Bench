#### 25.6.3.3 Using CLUSTERLOG STATISTICS in the NDB Cluster Management Client

The [`NDB`](mysql-cluster.md "Chapter 25 MySQL NDB Cluster 8.0") management client's
[`CLUSTERLOG STATISTICS`](mysql-cluster-logging-management-commands.md "25.6.3.1 NDB Cluster Logging Management Commands")
command can provide a number of useful statistics in its output.
Counters providing information about the state of the cluster
are updated at 5-second reporting intervals by the transaction
coordinator (TC) and the local query handler (LQH), and written
to the cluster log.

**Transaction coordinator statistics.**
Each transaction has one transaction coordinator, which is
chosen by one of the following methods:

- In a round-robin fashion
- By communication proximity
- By supplying a data placement hint when the transaction is
  started

Note

You can determine which TC selection method is used for
transactions started from a given SQL node using the
[`ndb_optimized_node_selection`](mysql-cluster-options-variables.md#sysvar_ndb_optimized_node_selection)
system variable.

All operations within the same transaction use the same
transaction coordinator, which reports the following statistics:

- **Trans count.**
  This is the number transactions started in the last
  interval using this TC as the transaction coordinator. Any
  of these transactions may have committed, have been
  aborted, or remain uncommitted at the end of the reporting
  interval.

  Note

  Transactions do not migrate between TCs.
- **Commit count.**
  This is the number of transactions using this TC as the
  transaction coordinator that were committed in the last
  reporting interval. Because some transactions committed in
  this reporting interval may have started in a previous
  reporting interval, it is possible for `Commit
  count` to be greater than `Trans
  count`.
- **Read count.**
  This is the number of primary key read operations using
  this TC as the transaction coordinator that were started
  in the last reporting interval, including simple reads.
  This count also includes reads performed as part of unique
  index operations. A unique index read operation generates
  2 primary key read operations—1 for the hidden
  unique index table, and 1 for the table on which the read
  takes place.
- **Simple read count.**
  This is the number of simple read operations using this TC
  as the transaction coordinator that were started in the
  last reporting interval.
- **Write count.**
  This is the number of primary key write operations using
  this TC as the transaction coordinator that were started
  in the last reporting interval. This includes all inserts,
  updates, writes and deletes, as well as writes performed
  as part of unique index operations.

  Note

  A unique index update operation can generate multiple PK
  read and write operations on the index table and on the
  base table.
- **AttrInfoCount.**
  This is the number of 32-bit data words received in the
  last reporting interval for primary key operations using
  this TC as the transaction coordinator. For reads, this is
  proportional to the number of columns requested. For
  inserts and updates, this is proportional to the number of
  columns written, and the size of their data. For delete
  operations, this is usually zero.

  Unique index operations generate multiple PK operations and
  so increase this count. However, data words sent to describe
  the PK operation itself, and the key information sent, are
  *not* counted here. Attribute information
  sent to describe columns to read for scans, or to describe
  ScanFilters, is also not counted in
  `AttrInfoCount`.
- **Concurrent Operations.**
  This is the number of primary key or scan operations using
  this TC as the transaction coordinator that were started
  during the last reporting interval but that were not
  completed. Operations increment this counter when they are
  started and decrement it when they are completed; this
  occurs after the transaction commits. Dirty reads and
  writes—as well as failed operations—decrement
  this counter.

  The maximum value that `Concurrent
  Operations` can have is the maximum number of
  operations that a TC block can support; currently, this is
  `(2 * MaxNoOfConcurrentOperations) + 16 +
  MaxNoOfConcurrentTransactions`. (For more
  information about these configuration parameters, see the
  *Transaction Parameters* section of
  [Section 25.4.3.6, “Defining NDB Cluster Data Nodes”](mysql-cluster-ndbd-definition.md "25.4.3.6 Defining NDB Cluster Data Nodes").)
- **Abort count.**
  This is the number of transactions using this TC as the
  transaction coordinator that were aborted during the last
  reporting interval. Because some transactions that were
  aborted in the last reporting interval may have started in
  a previous reporting interval, `Abort
  count` can sometimes be greater than
  `Trans count`.
- **Scans.**
  This is the number of table scans using this TC as the
  transaction coordinator that were started during the last
  reporting interval. This does not include range scans
  (that is, ordered index scans).
- **Range scans.**
  This is the number of ordered index scans using this TC as
  the transaction coordinator that were started in the last
  reporting interval.
- **Local reads.**
  This is the number of primary-key read operations
  performed using a transaction coordinator on a node that
  also holds the primary fragment replica of the record.
  This count can also be obtained from the
  `LOCAL_READS` counter in the
  [`ndbinfo.counters`](mysql-cluster-ndbinfo-counters.md "25.6.16.12 The ndbinfo counters Table") table.
- **Local writes.**
  This contains the number of primary-key read operations
  that were performed using a transaction coordinator on a
  node that also holds the primary fragment replica of the
  record. This count can also be obtained from the
  `LOCAL_WRITES` counter in the
  [`ndbinfo.counters`](mysql-cluster-ndbinfo-counters.md "25.6.16.12 The ndbinfo counters Table") table.

**Local query handler statistics (Operations).**
There is 1 cluster event per local query handler block (that
is, 1 per data node process). Operations are recorded in the
LQH where the data they are operating on resides.

Note

A single transaction may operate on data stored in multiple
LQH blocks.

The `Operations` statistic provides the number
of local operations performed by this LQH block in the last
reporting interval, and includes all types of read and write
operations (insert, update, write, and delete operations). This
also includes operations used to replicate writes. For example,
in a cluster with two fragment replicas, the write to the
primary fragment replica is recorded in the primary LQH, and the
write to the backup is recorded in the backup LQH. Unique key
operations may result in multiple local operations; however,
this does *not* include local operations
generated as a result of a table scan or ordered index scan,
which are not counted.

**Process scheduler statistics.**

In addition to the statistics reported by the transaction
coordinator and local query handler, each
[**ndbd**](mysql-cluster-programs-ndbd.md "25.5.1 ndbd — The NDB Cluster Data Node Daemon") process has a scheduler which also
provides useful metrics relating to the performance of an NDB
Cluster. This scheduler runs in an infinite loop; during each
loop the scheduler performs the following tasks:

1. Read any incoming messages from sockets into a job buffer.
2. Check whether there are any timed messages to be executed;
   if so, put these into the job buffer as well.
3. Execute (in a loop) any messages in the job buffer.
4. Send any distributed messages that were generated by
   executing the messages in the job buffer.
5. Wait for any new incoming messages.

Process scheduler statistics include the following:

- **Mean Loop Counter.**
  This is the number of loops executed in the third step
  from the preceding list. This statistic increases in size
  as the utilization of the TCP/IP buffer improves. You can
  use this to monitor changes in performance as you add new
  data node processes.
- **Mean send size and Mean receive size.**
  These statistics enable you to gauge the efficiency of,
  respectively writes and reads between nodes. The values
  are given in bytes. Higher values mean a lower cost per
  byte sent or received; the maximum value is 64K.

To cause all cluster log statistics to be logged, you can use
the following command in the [`NDB`](mysql-cluster.md "Chapter 25 MySQL NDB Cluster 8.0")
management client:

```ndbmgm
ndb_mgm> ALL CLUSTERLOG STATISTICS=15
```

Note

Setting the threshold for `STATISTICS` to 15
causes the cluster log to become very verbose, and to grow
quite rapidly in size, in direct proportion to the number of
cluster nodes and the amount of activity in the NDB Cluster.
