### 20.5.6 Using MySQL Enterprise Backup with Group Replication

[MySQL Enterprise Backup](mysql-enterprise-backup.md "32.1 MySQL Enterprise Backup Overview") is a
commercially-licensed backup utility for MySQL Server, available
with
[MySQL Enterprise Edition](https://www.mysql.com/products/enterprise/).
This section explains how to back up and subsequently restore a
Group Replication member using MySQL Enterprise Backup. The same technique can be
used to quickly add a new member to a group.

#### Backing up a Group Replication Member Using MySQL Enterprise Backup

Backing up a Group Replication member is similar to backing up a
stand-alone MySQL instance. The following instructions assume that
you are already familiar with how to use MySQL Enterprise Backup to perform a
backup; if that is not the case, please review
[Backing Up a Database Server](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/mysql-enterprise-backup/8.0/en/backing-up.html). Also note the requirements described
in [Grant MySQL Privileges to Backup Administrator](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/mysql-enterprise-backup/8.0/en/mysqlbackup.privileges.html) and
[Using MySQL Enterprise Backup with Group Replication](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/mysql-enterprise-backup/8.0/en/meb-group-replication.html).

Consider the following group with three members,
`s1`, `s2`, and
`s3`, running on hosts with the same names:

```sql
mysql> SELECT member_host, member_port, member_state FROM performance_schema.replication_group_members;
+-------------+-------------+--------------+
| member_host | member_port | member_state |
+-------------+-------------+--------------+
| s1          |        3306 | ONLINE       |
| s2          |        3306 | ONLINE       |
| s3          |        3306 | ONLINE       |
+-------------+-------------+--------------+
```

Using MySQL Enterprise Backup, create a backup of `s2` by issuing
on its host, for example, the following statement:

```terminal
s2> mysqlbackup --defaults-file=/etc/my.cnf --backup-image=/backups/my.mbi_`date +%d%m_%H%M` \
		      --backup-dir=/backups/backup_`date +%d%m_%H%M` --user=root -p \
--host=127.0.0.1 backup-to-image
```

Notes

- *For MySQL Enterprise Backup 8.0.18 and earlier,* If the
  system variable
  [`sql_require_primary_key`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_sql_require_primary_key) is
  set to `ON` for the group, MySQL Enterprise Backup is not
  able to log the backup progress on the servers. This is
  because the `backup_progress` table on the
  server is a CSV table, for which primary keys are not
  supported. In that case, **mysqlbackup**
  issues the following warnings during the backup operation:

  ```simple
  181011 11:17:06 MAIN WARNING: MySQL query 'CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS
  mysql.backup_progress( `backup_id` BIGINT NOT NULL, `tool_name` VARCHAR(4096)
  NOT NULL, `error_code` INT NOT NULL, `error_message` VARCHAR(4096) NOT NULL,
  `current_time` TIMESTAMP NOT NULL DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP               ON
  UPDATE CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,`current_state` VARCHAR(200) NOT NULL ) ENGINE=CSV
  DEFAULT CHARSET=utf8mb3 COLLATE=utf8mb3_bin': 3750, Unable to create a table
  without PK, when system variable 'sql_require_primary_key' is set. Add a PK
  to the table or unset this variable to avoid this message. Note that tables
  without PK can cause performance problems in row-based replication, so please
  consult your DBA before changing this setting.
  181011 11:17:06 MAIN WARNING: This backup operation's progress info cannot be
  logged.
  ```

  This does not prevent **mysqlbackup** from
  finishing the backup.
- *For MySQL Enterprise Backup 8.0.20 and earlier*, when
  backing up a secondary member, as MySQL Enterprise Backup cannot write backup
  status and metadata to a read-only server instance, it might
  issue warnings similar to the following one during the
  backup operation:

  ```simple
  181113 21:31:08 MAIN WARNING: This backup operation cannot write to backup
  progress. The MySQL server is running with the --super-read-only option.
  ```

  You can avoid the warning by using the
  `--no-history-logging` option with your
  backup command. This is not an issue for MySQL Enterprise Backup 8.0.21 and
  higher—see [Using MySQL Enterprise Backup with Group Replication](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/mysql-enterprise-backup/8.0/en/meb-group-replication.html) for
  details.

#### Restoring a Failed Member

Assume one of the members (`s3` in the following
example) is irreconcilably corrupted. The most recent backup of
group member `s2` can be used to restore
`s3`. Here are the steps for performing the
restore:

1. *Copy the backup of s2 onto the host for
   s3.* The exact way to copy the backup depends on the
   operating system and tools available to you. In this example,
   we assume the hosts are both Linux servers and use SCP to copy
   the files between them:

   ```terminal
   s2/backups> scp my.mbi_2206_1429 s3:/backups
   ```
2. *Restore the backup.* Connect to the target
   host (the host for `s3` in this case), and
   restore the backup using MySQL Enterprise Backup. Here are the steps:

   1. Stop the corrupted server, if it is still running. For
      example, on Linux distributions that use systemd:

      ```simple
      s3> systemctl stop mysqld
      ```
   2. Preserve the two configuration files in the corrupted
      server's data directory, `auto.cnf` and
      `mysqld-auto.cnf` (if it exists), by
      copying them to a safe location outside of the data
      directory. This is for preserving the
      [server's UUID](replication-options.md#sysvar_server_uuid)
      and [Section 7.1.9.3, “Persisted System Variables”](persisted-system-variables.md "7.1.9.3 Persisted System Variables") (if
      used), which are needed in the steps below.
   3. Delete all contents in the data directory of
      `s3`. For example:

      ```terminal
      s3> rm -rf /var/lib/mysql/*
      ```

      If the system variables
      [`innodb_data_home_dir`](innodb-parameters.md#sysvar_innodb_data_home_dir),
      [`innodb_log_group_home_dir`](innodb-parameters.md#sysvar_innodb_log_group_home_dir),
      and [`innodb_undo_directory`](innodb-parameters.md#sysvar_innodb_undo_directory)
      point to any directories other than the data directory,
      they should also be made empty; otherwise, the restore
      operation fails.
   4. Restore backup of `s2` onto the host for
      `s3`:

      ```terminal
      s3> mysqlbackup --defaults-file=/etc/my.cnf \
        --datadir=/var/lib/mysql \
        --backup-image=/backups/my.mbi_2206_1429  \
      --backup-dir=/tmp/restore_`date +%d%m_%H%M` copy-back-and-apply-log
      ```

      Note

      The command above assumes that the binary logs and relay
      logs on `s2` and `s3`
      have the same base name and are at the same location on
      the two servers. If these conditions are not met, you
      should use the [`--log-bin`](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/mysql-enterprise-backup/8.0/en/server-repository-options.html#option_meb_log-bin) and
      [`--relay-log`](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/mysql-enterprise-backup/8.0/en/server-repository-options.html#option_meb_relay-log) options to
      restore the binary log and relay log to their original
      file paths on `s3`. For example, if you
      know that on `s3` the binary log's base
      name is `s3-bin` and the relay-log's
      base name is `s3-relay-bin`, your
      restore command should look like:

      ```terminal
      mysqlbackup --defaults-file=/etc/my.cnf \
        --datadir=/var/lib/mysql \
        --backup-image=/backups/my.mbi_2206_1429  \
        --log-bin=s3-bin --relay-log=s3-relay-bin \
        --backup-dir=/tmp/restore_`date +%d%m_%H%M` copy-back-and-apply-log
      ```

      Being able to restore the binary log and relay log to
      the right file paths makes the restore process easier;
      if that is impossible for some reason, see
      [Rebuild the Failed Member to Rejoin as a New Member](group-replication-enterprise-backup.md#group-replication-rebuild-member "Rebuild the Failed Member to Rejoin as a New Member").
3. *Restore the `auto.cnf` file for
   s3.* To rejoin the replication group, the restored
   member *must* have the same
   [`server_uuid`](replication-options.md#sysvar_server_uuid) it used to join
   the group before. Supply the old server UUID by copying the
   `auto.cnf` file preserved in step 2 above
   into the data directory of the restored member.

   Note

   If you cannot supply the failed member's original
   [`server_uuid`](replication-options.md#sysvar_server_uuid) to the restored
   member by restoring its old `auto.cnf`
   file, you must let the restored member join the group as a
   new member; see instructions in
   [Rebuild the Failed Member to Rejoin as a New Member](group-replication-enterprise-backup.md#group-replication-rebuild-member "Rebuild the Failed Member to Rejoin as a New Member") below on
   how to do that.
4. *Restore the `mysqld-auto.cnf`
   file for s3 (only required if s3 used persistent system
   variables).* The settings for the
   [Section 7.1.9.3, “Persisted System Variables”](persisted-system-variables.md "7.1.9.3 Persisted System Variables") that were used to
   configure the failed member must be provided to the restored
   member. These settings are to be found in the
   `mysqld-auto.cnf` file of the failed
   server, which you should have preserved in step 2 above.
   Restore the file to the data directory of the restored server.
   See
   [Restoring Persisted System Variables](group-replication-enterprise-backup.md#group-replication-meb-restore-persisted-variables "Restoring Persisted System Variables")
   on what to do if you do not have a copy of the file.
5. *Start the restored server.* For example,
   on Linux distributions that use systemd:

   ```terminal
   systemctl start mysqld
   ```

   Note

   If the server you are restoring is a primary member, perform
   the steps described in
   [Restoring a Primary Member](group-replication-enterprise-backup.md#group-replication-meb-restore-primary "Restoring a Primary Member")
   *before starting the restored server*.
6. *Restart Group Replication.* Connect to the
   restarted `s3` using, for example, a
   [**mysql**](mysql.md "6.5.1 mysql — The MySQL Command-Line Client") client, and issue the following
   statement:

   ```sql
   mysql> START GROUP_REPLICATION;
   ```

   Before the restored instance can become an online member of
   the group, it needs to apply any transactions that have
   happened to the group after the backup was taken; this is
   achieved using Group Replication's
   [distributed
   recovery](group-replication-distributed-recovery.md "20.5.4 Distributed Recovery") mechanism, and the process starts after the
   [START
   GROUP\_REPLICATION](start-group-replication.md "15.4.3.1 START GROUP_REPLICATION Statement") statement has been issued. To check
   the member status of the restored instance, issue:

   ```sql
   mysql> SELECT member_host, member_port, member_state FROM performance_schema.replication_group_members;
   +-------------+-------------+--------------+
   | member_host | member_port | member_state |
   +-------------+-------------+--------------+
   | s1          |        3306 | ONLINE       |
   | s2          |        3306 | ONLINE       |
   | s3          |        3306 | RECOVERING   |
   +-------------+-------------+--------------+
   ```

   This shows that `s3` is applying transactions
   to catch up with the group. Once it has caught up with the
   rest of the group, its `member_state` changes
   to `ONLINE`:

   ```sql
   mysql> SELECT member_host, member_port, member_state FROM performance_schema.replication_group_members;
   +-------------+-------------+--------------+
   | member_host | member_port | member_state |
   +-------------+-------------+--------------+
   | s1          |        3306 | ONLINE       |
   | s2          |        3306 | ONLINE       |
   | s3          |        3306 | ONLINE       |
   +-------------+-------------+--------------+
   ```

   Note

   If the server you are restoring is a primary member, once it
   has gained synchrony with the group and become
   `ONLINE`, perform the steps described at
   the end of
   [Restoring a Primary Member](group-replication-enterprise-backup.md#group-replication-meb-restore-primary "Restoring a Primary Member") to
   revert the configuration changes you had made to the server
   before you started it.

The member has now been fully restored from the backup and
functions as a regular member of the group.

#### Rebuild the Failed Member to Rejoin as a New Member

Sometimes, the steps outlined above in
[Restoring a Failed Member](group-replication-enterprise-backup.md#group-replication-restore-failed-member "Restoring a Failed Member") cannot
be carried out because, for example, the binary log or relay log
is corrupted, or it is just missing from the backup. In such a
situation, use the backup to rebuild the member, and then add it
to the group as a new member. In the steps below, we assume the
rebuilt member is named `s3`, like the failed
member, and that it runs on the same host as
`s3`:

1. *Copy the backup of s2 onto the host for s3
   .* The exact way to copy the backup depends on the
   operating system and tools available to you. In this example
   we assume the hosts are both Linux servers and use SCP to copy
   the files between them:

   ```terminal
   s2/backups> scp my.mbi_2206_1429 s3:/backups
   ```
2. *Restore the backup.* Connect to the target
   host (the host for `s3` in this case), and
   restore the backup using MySQL Enterprise Backup. Here are the steps:

   1. Stop the corrupted server, if it is still running. For
      example, on Linux distributions that use systemd:

      ```simple
      s3> systemctl stop mysqld
      ```
   2. Preserve the configuration file
      `mysqld-auto.cnf`, if it is found in
      the corrupted server's data directory, by copying it to a
      safe location outside of the data directory. This is for
      preserving the server's
      [Section 7.1.9.3, “Persisted System Variables”](persisted-system-variables.md "7.1.9.3 Persisted System Variables"), which are
      needed later.
   3. Delete all contents in the data directory of
      `s3`. For example:

      ```terminal
      s3> rm -rf /var/lib/mysql/*
      ```

      If the system variables
      [`innodb_data_home_dir`](innodb-parameters.md#sysvar_innodb_data_home_dir),
      [`innodb_log_group_home_dir`](innodb-parameters.md#sysvar_innodb_log_group_home_dir),
      and [`innodb_undo_directory`](innodb-parameters.md#sysvar_innodb_undo_directory)
      point to any directories other than the data directory,
      they should also be made empty; otherwise, the restore
      operation fails.
   4. Restore the backup of `s2` onto the host
      of `s3`. With this approach, we are
      rebuilding `s3` as a
      new member, for which we do not need or do not want to use
      the old binary and relay logs in the backup; therefore, if
      these logs have been included in your backup, exclude them
      using the [`--skip-binlog`](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/mysql-enterprise-backup/8.0/en/backup-capacity-options.html#option_meb_skip-binlog) and
      [`--skip-relaylog`](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/mysql-enterprise-backup/8.0/en/backup-capacity-options.html#option_meb_skip-relaylog) options:

      ```terminal
      s3> mysqlbackup --defaults-file=/etc/my.cnf \
        --datadir=/var/lib/mysql \
        --backup-image=/backups/my.mbi_2206_1429  \
        --backup-dir=/tmp/restore_`date +%d%m_%H%M` \
        --skip-binlog --skip-relaylog \
      copy-back-and-apply-log
      ```

      Note

      If you have healthy binary log and relay logs in the
      backup that you can transfer onto the target host with
      no issues, you are recommended to follow the easier
      procedure as described in
      [Restoring a Failed Member](group-replication-enterprise-backup.md#group-replication-restore-failed-member "Restoring a Failed Member")
      above.
3. *Restore the `mysqld-auto.cnf`
   file for s3 (only required if s3 used persistent system
   variables).* The settings for the
   [Section 7.1.9.3, “Persisted System Variables”](persisted-system-variables.md "7.1.9.3 Persisted System Variables") that were used to
   configure the failed member must be provided to the restored
   server. These settings are to be found in the
   `mysqld-auto.cnf` file of the failed
   server, which you should have preserved in step 2 above.
   Restore the file to the data directory of the restored server.
   See
   [Restoring Persisted System Variables](group-replication-enterprise-backup.md#group-replication-meb-restore-persisted-variables "Restoring Persisted System Variables")
   on what to do if you do not have a copy of the file.

   Note

   Do NOT restore the corrupted server's
   `auto.cnf` file to the data directory of
   the new member—when the rebuilt `s3`
   joins the group as a new member, it is going to be assigned
   a new server UUID.
4. *Start the restored server.* For example,
   on Linux distributions that use systemd:

   ```terminal
   systemctl start mysqld
   ```

   Note

   If the server you are restoring is a primary member, perform
   the steps described in
   [Restoring a Primary Member](group-replication-enterprise-backup.md#group-replication-meb-restore-primary "Restoring a Primary Member")
   *before starting the restored server*.
5. *Reconfigure the restored member to join Group
   Replication.* Connect to the restored server with a
   [**mysql**](mysql.md "6.5.1 mysql — The MySQL Command-Line Client") client and reset the source and
   replica information with the following statements:

   ```sql
   mysql> RESET MASTER;
   ```

   ```sql
   mysql> RESET MASTER;
   mysql> RESET SLAVE ALL;
   ```

   In MySQL 8.0.22 and later, use the statements shown here:

   ```sql
   mysql> RESET MASTER;
   mysql> RESET REPLICA ALL;
   ```

   For the restored server to be able to recover automatically
   using Group Replication's built-in mechanism for
   [distributed
   recovery](group-replication-distributed-recovery.md "20.5.4 Distributed Recovery"), configure the server's
   [`gtid_executed`](replication-options-gtids.md#sysvar_gtid_executed) variable. To do
   this, use the `backup_gtid_executed.sql`
   file included in the backup of `s2`, which is
   usually restored under the restored member's data directory.
   Disable binary logging, use the
   `backup_gtid_executed.sql` file to
   configure [`gtid_executed`](replication-options-gtids.md#sysvar_gtid_executed), and
   then re-enable binary logging by issuing the following
   statements with your [**mysql**](mysql.md "6.5.1 mysql — The MySQL Command-Line Client") client:

   ```sql
   mysql> SET SQL_LOG_BIN=OFF;
   mysql> SOURCE datadir/backup_gtid_executed.sql
   mysql> SET SQL_LOG_BIN=ON;
   ```

   Then, configure the
   [Group
   Replication user credentials](group-replication-user-credentials.md "20.2.1.3 User Credentials For Distributed Recovery") on the member using the
   SQL statements shown here:

   ```sql
   mysql> CHANGE MASTER TO MASTER_USER='rpl_user', MASTER_PASSWORD='password'
   		-> FOR CHANNEL 'group_replication_recovery';
   ```

   In MySQL 8.0.23 and later, use these statements instead:

   ```sql
   mysql> CHANGE REPLICATION SOURCE TO SOURCE_USER='rpl_user', SOURCE_PASSWORD='password'
   		-> FOR CHANNEL 'group_replication_recovery';
   ```
6. *Restart Group Replication.* Issue the
   following statement to the restored server with your
   [**mysql**](mysql.md "6.5.1 mysql — The MySQL Command-Line Client") client:

   ```sql
   mysql>> START GROUP_REPLICATION;
   ```

   Before the restored instance can become an online member of
   the group, it needs to apply any transactions that have
   happened to the group after the backup was taken; this is
   achieved using Group Replication's
   [distributed
   recovery](group-replication-distributed-recovery.md "20.5.4 Distributed Recovery") mechanism, and the process starts after the
   [START
   GROUP\_REPLICATION](start-group-replication.md "15.4.3.1 START GROUP_REPLICATION Statement") statement has been issued. To check
   the member status of the restored instance, issue:

   ```sql
   mysql> SELECT member_host, member_port, member_state FROM performance_schema.replication_group_members;
   +-------------+-------------+--------------+
   | member_host | member_port | member_state |
   +-------------+-------------+--------------+
   | s3          |        3306 | RECOVERING   |
   | s2          |        3306 | ONLINE       |
   | s1          |        3306 | ONLINE       |
   +-------------+-------------+--------------+
   ```

   This shows that `s3` is applying transactions
   to catch up with the group. Once it has caught up with the
   rest of the group, its `member_state` changes
   to `ONLINE`:

   ```sql
   mysql> SELECT member_host, member_port, member_state FROM performance_schema.replication_group_members;
   +-------------+-------------+--------------+
   | member_host | member_port | member_state |
   +-------------+-------------+--------------+
   | s3          |        3306 | ONLINE       |
   | s2          |        3306 | ONLINE       |
   | s1          |        3306 | ONLINE       |
   +-------------+-------------+--------------+
   ```

   Note

   If the server you are restoring is a primary member, once it
   has gained synchrony with the group and become
   `ONLINE`, perform the steps described at
   the end of
   [Restoring a Primary Member](group-replication-enterprise-backup.md#group-replication-meb-restore-primary "Restoring a Primary Member") to
   revert the configuration changes you had made to the server
   before you started it.

The member has now been restored to the group as a new member.

**Restoring Persisted System Variables.**
**mysqlbackup** does not provide support for
backing up or preserving
[Section 7.1.9.3, “Persisted System Variables”](persisted-system-variables.md "7.1.9.3 Persisted System Variables")—the file
`mysqld-auto.cnf` is not included in a
backup. To start the restored member with its persisted variable
settings, you need to do one of the following:

- Preserve a copy of the `mysqld-auto.cnf`
  file from the corrupted server, and copy it to the restored
  server's data directory.
- Copy the `mysqld-auto.cnf` file from
  another member of the group into the restored server's data
  directory, if that member has the same persisted system
  variable settings as the corrupted member.
- After the restored server is started and before you restart
  Group Replication, set all the system variables manually to
  their persisted values through a [**mysql**](mysql.md "6.5.1 mysql — The MySQL Command-Line Client")
  client.

**Restoring a Primary Member.**
If the restored member is a primary in the group, care must be
taken to prevent writes to the restored database during the
Group Replication distributed recovery process. Depending on how
the group is accessed by clients, there is a possibility of DML
statements being executed on the restored member once it becomes
accessible on the network, prior to the member finishing its
catch-up on the activities it has missed while off the group. To
avoid this, *before starting the restored
server*, configure the following system variables in
the server option file:

```ini
group_replication_start_on_boot=OFF
super_read_only=ON
event_scheduler=OFF
```

These settings ensure that the member becomes read-only at
startup, and that the event scheduler is turned off while the
member catches up with the group during the distributed recovery
process. Adequate error handling must also be provided for on the
clients, since they are unable to perform DML operations during
this period on the member being restored.

Once the restoration process is fully completed and the restored
member is synchronized with the rest of the group, you can revert
these changes. First, restart the event scheduler using the
statement shown here:

```sql
mysql> SET global event_scheduler=ON;
```

After this, you should set the following system variables in the
member's option file, so that they have the necessary values
for the next time that the member is started:

```ini
group_replication_start_on_boot=ON
super_read_only=OFF
event_scheduler=ON
```
