Security-Enhanced Linux (SELinux) is a mandatory access control
(MAC) system that implements access rights by applying a security
label referred to as an *SELinux context* to each
system object. SELinux policy modules use SELinux contexts to define
rules for how processes, files, ports, and other system objects
interact with each other. Interaction between system objects is only
permitted if a policy rule allows it.

An SELinux context (the label applied to a system object) has the
following fields: `user`, `role`,
`type`, and `security level`. Type
information rather than the entire SELinux context is used most
commonly to define rules for how processes interact with other
system objects. MySQL SELinux policy modules, for example, define
policy rules using `type` information.

You can view SELinux contexts using operating system commands such
as **ls** and **ps** with the
`-Z` option. Assuming that SELinux is enabled and a
MySQL Server is running, the following commands show the SELinux
context for the [**mysqld**](mysqld.md "6.3.1 mysqld — The MySQL Server") process and MySQL data
directory:

[**mysqld**](mysqld.md "6.3.1 mysqld — The MySQL Server") process:

```terminal
$> ps -eZ | grep mysqld
system_u:system_r:mysqld_t:s0    5924 ?        00:00:03 mysqld
```

MySQL data directory:

```terminal
$> cd /var/lib
$> ls -Z | grep mysql
system_u:object_r:mysqld_db_t:s0 mysql
```

where:

- `system_u` is an SELinux user identity for
  system processes and objects.
- `system_r` is an SELinux role used for system
  processes.
- `objects_r` is an SELinux role used for system
  objects.
- `mysqld_t` is the type associated with the
  mysqld process.
- `mysqld_db_t` is the type associated with the
  MySQL data directory and its files.
- `s0` is the security level.

For more information about interpreting SELinux contexts, refer to
your distribution's SELinux documentation.
