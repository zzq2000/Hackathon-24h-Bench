### 6.3.1 mysqld — The MySQL Server

[**mysqld**](mysqld.md "6.3.1 mysqld — The MySQL Server"), also known as MySQL Server, is a
single multithreaded program that does most of the work in a
MySQL installation. It does not spawn additional processes.
MySQL Server manages access to the MySQL data directory that
contains databases and tables. The data directory is also the
default location for other information such as log files and
status files.

Note

Some installation packages contain a debugging version of the
server named [**mysqld-debug**](mysqld.md "6.3.1 mysqld — The MySQL Server"). Invoke this
version instead of [**mysqld**](mysqld.md "6.3.1 mysqld — The MySQL Server") for debugging
support, memory allocation checking, and trace file support
(see [Section 7.9.1.2, “Creating Trace Files”](making-trace-files.md "7.9.1.2 Creating Trace Files")).

When MySQL server starts, it listens for network connections
from client programs and manages access to databases on behalf
of those clients.

The [**mysqld**](mysqld.md "6.3.1 mysqld — The MySQL Server") program has many options that can
be specified at startup. For a complete list of options, run
this command:

```terminal
mysqld --verbose --help
```

MySQL Server also has a set of system variables that affect its
operation as it runs. System variables can be set at server
startup, and many of them can be changed at runtime to effect
dynamic server reconfiguration. MySQL Server also has a set of
status variables that provide information about its operation.
You can monitor these status variables to access runtime
performance characteristics.

For a full description of MySQL Server command options, system
variables, and status variables, see
[Section 7.1, “The MySQL Server”](mysqld-server.md "7.1 The MySQL Server"). For information about
installing MySQL and setting up the initial configuration, see
[Chapter 2, *Installing MySQL*](installing.md "Chapter 2 Installing MySQL").
