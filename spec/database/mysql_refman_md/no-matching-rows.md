#### B.3.4.7 Solving Problems with No Matching Rows

If you have a complicated query that uses many tables but that
returns no rows, you should use the following procedure to
find out what is wrong:

1. Test the query with [`EXPLAIN`](explain.md "15.8.2 EXPLAIN Statement")
   to check whether you can find something that is obviously
   wrong. See [Section 15.8.2, “EXPLAIN Statement”](explain.md "15.8.2 EXPLAIN Statement").
2. Select only those columns that are used in the
   `WHERE` clause.
3. Remove one table at a time from the query until it returns
   some rows. If the tables are large, it is a good idea to
   use `LIMIT 10` with the query.
4. Issue a [`SELECT`](select.md "15.2.13 SELECT Statement") for the
   column that should have matched a row against the table
   that was last removed from the query.
5. If you are comparing [`FLOAT`](floating-point-types.md "13.1.4 Floating-Point Types (Approximate Value) - FLOAT, DOUBLE")
   or [`DOUBLE`](floating-point-types.md "13.1.4 Floating-Point Types (Approximate Value) - FLOAT, DOUBLE") columns with
   numbers that have decimals, you cannot use equality
   (`=`) comparisons. This problem is common
   in most computer languages because not all floating-point
   values can be stored with exact precision. In some cases,
   changing the [`FLOAT`](floating-point-types.md "13.1.4 Floating-Point Types (Approximate Value) - FLOAT, DOUBLE") to a
   [`DOUBLE`](floating-point-types.md "13.1.4 Floating-Point Types (Approximate Value) - FLOAT, DOUBLE") fixes this. See
   [Section B.3.4.8, “Problems with Floating-Point Values”](problems-with-float.md "B.3.4.8 Problems with Floating-Point Values").
6. If you still cannot figure out what is wrong, create a
   minimal test that can be run with `mysql test <
   query.sql` that shows your problems. You can
   create a test file by dumping the tables with
   [**mysqldump --quick db\_name
   *`tbl_name_1`* ...
   *`tbl_name_n`* >
   query.sql**](mysqldump.md "6.5.4 mysqldump — A Database Backup Program"). Open the file in an editor, remove
   some insert lines (if there are more than needed to
   demonstrate the problem), and add your
   [`SELECT`](select.md "15.2.13 SELECT Statement") statement at the end
   of the file.

   Verify that the test file demonstrates the problem by
   executing these commands:

   ```terminal
   $> mysqladmin create test2
   $> mysql test2 < query.sql
   ```

   Attach the test file to a bug report, which you can file
   using the instructions in [Section 1.5, “How to Report Bugs or Problems”](bug-reports.md "1.5 How to Report Bugs or Problems").
