[25.2.7.11 Previous NDB Cluster Issues Resolved in NDB Cluster 8.0](mysql-cluster-limitations-resolved.md)

In the sections that follow, we discuss known limitations in
current releases of NDB Cluster as compared with the features
available when using the `MyISAM` and
`InnoDB` storage engines. If you check the
“Cluster” category in the MySQL bugs database at
<http://bugs.mysql.com>, you can find known bugs in
the following categories under “MySQL Server:” in the
MySQL bugs database at <http://bugs.mysql.com>, which
we intend to correct in upcoming releases of NDB Cluster:

- NDB Cluster
- Cluster Direct API (NDBAPI)
- Cluster Disk Data
- Cluster Replication
- ClusterJ

This information is intended to be complete with respect to the
conditions just set forth. You can report any discrepancies that
you encounter to the MySQL bugs database using the instructions
given in [Section 1.5, “How to Report Bugs or Problems”](bug-reports.md "1.5 How to Report Bugs or Problems"). Any problem which we do
not plan to fix in NDB Cluster 8.0, is added to the
list.

See [Section 25.2.7.11, “Previous NDB Cluster Issues Resolved in NDB Cluster 8.0”](mysql-cluster-limitations-resolved.md "25.2.7.11 Previous NDB Cluster Issues Resolved in NDB Cluster 8.0") for a
list of issues in earlier releases that have been resolved in NDB
Cluster 8.0.

Note

Limitations and other issues specific to NDB Cluster Replication
are described in
[Section 25.7.3, “Known Issues in NDB Cluster Replication”](mysql-cluster-replication-issues.md "25.7.3 Known Issues in NDB Cluster Replication").
