#### 17.20.6.3 Tuning InnoDB memcached Plugin Performance

Because using `InnoDB` in combination with
**memcached** involves writing all data to disk,
whether immediately or sometime later, raw performance is
expected to be somewhat slower than using
**memcached** by itself. When using the
`InnoDB` **memcached** plugin,
focus tuning goals for **memcached** operations
on achieving better performance than equivalent SQL operations.

Benchmarks suggest that queries and
[DML](glossary.md#glos_dml "DML") operations (inserts,
updates, and deletes) that use the **memcached**
interface are faster than traditional SQL. DML operations
typically see a larger improvements. Therefore, consider
adapting write-intensive applications to use the
**memcached** interface first. Also consider
prioritizing adaptation of write-intensive applications that use
fast, lightweight mechanisms that lack reliability.

##### Adapting SQL Queries

The types of queries that are most suited to simple
`GET` requests are those with a single clause
or a set of `AND` conditions in the
`WHERE` clause:

```sql
SQL:
SELECT col FROM tbl WHERE key = 'key_value';

memcached:
get key_value

SQL:
SELECT col FROM tbl WHERE col1 = val1 and col2 = val2 and col3 = val3;

memcached:
# Since you must always know these 3 values to look up the key,
# combine them into a unique string and use that as the key
# for all ADD, SET, and GET operations.
key_value = val1 + ":" + val2 + ":" + val3
get key_value

SQL:
SELECT 'key exists!' FROM tbl
  WHERE EXISTS (SELECT col1 FROM tbl WHERE KEY = 'key_value') LIMIT 1;

memcached:
# Test for existence of key by asking for its value and checking if the call succeeds,
# ignoring the value itself. For existence checking, you typically only store a very
# short value such as "1".
get key_value
```

##### Using System Memory

For best performance, deploy the
`daemon_memcached` plugin on machines that are
configured as typical database servers, where the majority of
system RAM is devoted to the `InnoDB`
[buffer pool](glossary.md#glos_buffer_pool "buffer pool"), through the
[`innodb_buffer_pool_size`](innodb-parameters.md#sysvar_innodb_buffer_pool_size)
configuration option. For systems with multi-gigabyte buffer
pools, consider raising the value of
[`innodb_buffer_pool_instances`](innodb-parameters.md#sysvar_innodb_buffer_pool_instances)
for maximum throughput when most operations involve data that is
already cached in memory.

##### Reducing Redundant I/O

`InnoDB` has a number of settings that let you
choose the balance between high reliability, in case of a crash,
and the amount of I/O overhead during high write workloads. For
example, consider setting the
[`innodb_doublewrite`](innodb-parameters.md#sysvar_innodb_doublewrite) to
`0` and
[`innodb_flush_log_at_trx_commit`](innodb-parameters.md#sysvar_innodb_flush_log_at_trx_commit)
to `2`. Measure performance with different
[`innodb_flush_method`](innodb-parameters.md#sysvar_innodb_flush_method) settings.

For other ways to reduce or tune I/O for table operations, see
[Section 10.5.8, “Optimizing InnoDB Disk I/O”](optimizing-innodb-diskio.md "10.5.8 Optimizing InnoDB Disk I/O").

##### Reducing Transactional Overhead

A default value of 1 for
[`daemon_memcached_r_batch_size`](innodb-parameters.md#sysvar_daemon_memcached_r_batch_size)
and
[`daemon_memcached_w_batch_size`](innodb-parameters.md#sysvar_daemon_memcached_w_batch_size)
is intended for maximum reliability of results and safety of
stored or updated data.

Depending on the type of application, you might increase one or
both of these settings to reduce the overhead of frequent
[commit](glossary.md#glos_commit "commit") operations. On a busy
system, you might increase
[`daemon_memcached_r_batch_size`](innodb-parameters.md#sysvar_daemon_memcached_r_batch_size),
knowing that changes to data made through SQL may not become
visible to **memcached** immediately (that is,
until *`N`* more `get`
operations are processed). When processing data where every
write operation must be reliably stored, leave
[`daemon_memcached_w_batch_size`](innodb-parameters.md#sysvar_daemon_memcached_w_batch_size)
set to `1`. Increase the setting when
processing large numbers of updates intended only for
statistical analysis, where losing the last
*`N`* updates in an unexpected exit is an
acceptable risk.

For example, imagine a system that monitors traffic crossing a
busy bridge, recording data for approximately 100,000 vehicles
each day. If the application counts different types of vehicles
to analyze traffic patterns, changing
[`daemon_memcached_w_batch_size`](innodb-parameters.md#sysvar_daemon_memcached_w_batch_size)
from `1` to `100` reduces I/O
overhead for commit operations by 99%. In case of an outage, a
maximum of 100 records are lost, which may be an acceptable
margin of error. If instead the application performed automated
toll collection for each car, you would set
[`daemon_memcached_w_batch_size`](innodb-parameters.md#sysvar_daemon_memcached_w_batch_size)
to `1` to ensure that each toll record is
immediately saved to disk.

Because of the way `InnoDB` organizes
**memcached** key values on disk, if you have a
large number of keys to create, it may be faster to sort the
data items by key value in the application and
`add` them in sorted order, rather than create
keys in arbitrary order.

The **memslap** command, which is part of the
regular **memcached** distribution but not
included with the `daemon_memcached` plugin,
can be useful for benchmarking different configurations. It can
also be used to generate sample key-value pairs to use in your
own benchmarks.
