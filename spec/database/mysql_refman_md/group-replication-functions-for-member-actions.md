#### 14.18.1.5 Functions to Set and Reset Group Replication Member Actions

The following functions can be used to enable and disable
actions for members of a group to take in specified
situations, and to reset the configuration to the default
setting for all member actions. They can only be used by
administrators with the
[`GROUP_REPLICATION_ADMIN`](privileges-provided.md#priv_group-replication-admin)
privilege or the deprecated
[`SUPER`](privileges-provided.md#priv_super) privilege.

You configure member actions on the group’s primary using
the
[`group_replication_enable_member_action`](group-replication-functions-for-member-actions.md#function_group-replication-enable-member-action)
and
[`group_replication_disable_member_action`](group-replication-functions-for-member-actions.md#function_group-replication-disable-member-action)
functions. The member actions configuration, consisting of all
the member actions and whether they are enabled or disabled,
is then propagated to other group members and joining members
using Group Replication’s group messages. This means that
the group members will all act in the same way when they are
in the specified situation, and you only need to use the
function on the primary.

The functions can also be used on a server that is not part of
a group, as long as the Group Replication plugin is installed.
In that case, the member actions configuration is not
propagated to any other servers.

The
[`group_replication_reset_member_actions`](group-replication-functions-for-member-actions.md#function_group-replication-reset-member-actions)
function can only be used on a server that is not part of a
group. It resets the member actions configuration to the
default settings, and resets its version number. The server
must be writeable (with the
[`read_only`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_read_only) system variable set
to `OFF`) and have the Group Replication
plugin installed.

The available member actions are as follows:

`mysql_disable_super_read_only_if_primary`
:   This member action is available from MySQL 8.0.26. It is
    taken after a member is elected as the group’s
    primary, which is the event
    `AFTER_PRIMARY_ELECTION`. The member
    action is enabled by default. You can disable it using
    the
    [`group_replication_disable_member_action()`](group-replication-functions-for-member-actions.md#function_group-replication-disable-member-action)
    function, and re-enable it using
    [`group_replication_enable_member_action()`](group-replication-functions-for-member-actions.md#function_group-replication-enable-member-action).

    When this member action is enabled and taken, super
    read-only mode is disabled on the primary, so that the
    primary becomes read-write and accepts updates from a
    replication source server and from clients. This is the
    normal situation.

    When this member action is disabled and not taken, the
    primary remains in super read-only mode after election.
    In this state, it does not accept updates from any
    clients, even users who have the
    [`CONNECTION_ADMIN`](privileges-provided.md#priv_connection-admin) or
    [`SUPER`](privileges-provided.md#priv_super) privilege. It does
    continue to accept updates performed by replication
    threads. This setup means that when a group’s purpose
    is to provide a secondary backup to another group for
    disaster tolerance, you can ensure that the secondary
    group remains synchronized with the first.

`mysql_start_failover_channels_if_primary`
:   This member action is available from MySQL 8.0.27. It is
    taken after a member is elected as the group’s
    primary, which is the event
    `AFTER_PRIMARY_ELECTION`. The member
    action is enabled by default. You can disable it using
    the
    [`group_replication_disable_member_action()`](group-replication-functions-for-member-actions.md#function_group-replication-disable-member-action)
    function, and re-enable it using the
    [`group_replication_enable_member_action()`](group-replication-functions-for-member-actions.md#function_group-replication-enable-member-action)
    function.

    When this member action is enabled, asynchronous
    connection failover for replicas is active for a
    replication channel on a Group Replication primary when
    you set
    `SOURCE_CONNECTION_AUTO_FAILOVER=1` in
    the [`CHANGE REPLICATION SOURCE
    TO`](change-replication-source-to.md "15.4.2.3 CHANGE REPLICATION SOURCE TO Statement") statement for the channel. When the feature
    is active and correctly configured, if the primary that
    is replicating goes offline or into an error state, the
    new primary starts replication on the same channel when
    it is elected. This is the normal situation. For
    instructions to configure the feature, see
    [Section 19.4.9.2, “Asynchronous Connection Failover for Replicas”](replication-asynchronous-connection-failover-replica.md "19.4.9.2 Asynchronous Connection Failover for Replicas").

    When this member action is disabled, asynchronous
    connection failover does not take place for the
    replicas. If the primary goes offline or into an error
    state, replication stops for the channel. Note that if
    there is more than one channel with
    `SOURCE_CONNECTION_AUTO_FAILOVER=1`,
    the member action covers all the channels, so they
    cannot be individually enabled and disabled by this
    method. Set
    `SOURCE_CONNECTION_AUTO_FAILOVER=0` to
    disable an individual channel.

member actions configuration, see
[Section 20.5.1.5, “Configuring Member Actions”](group-replication-member-actions.md "20.5.1.5 Configuring Member Actions").

- [`group_replication_disable_member_action()`](group-replication-functions-for-member-actions.md#function_group-replication-disable-member-action)

  Disable a member action so that the member does not take
  it in the specified situation. If the server where you use
  the function is part of a group, it must be the current
  primary in a group in single-primary mode, and it must be
  part of the majority. The changed setting is propagated to
  other group members and joining members, so they will all
  act in the same way when they are in the specified
  situation, and you only need to use the function on the
  primary.

  Syntax:

  ```clike
  STRING group_replication_disable_member_action(name, event)
  ```

  Arguments:

  - *`name`*: The name of the
    member action to disable.
  - *`event`*: The event that
    triggers the member action.

  Return value:

  A string containing the result of the operation, for
  example whether it was successful or not.

  Example:

  ```sql
  SELECT group_replication_disable_member_action("mysql_disable_super_read_only_if_primary", "AFTER_PRIMARY_ELECTION");
  ```

  For more information, see
  [Section 20.5.1.5, “Configuring Member Actions”](group-replication-member-actions.md "20.5.1.5 Configuring Member Actions").
- [`group_replication_enable_member_action()`](group-replication-functions-for-member-actions.md#function_group-replication-enable-member-action)

  Enable a member action for the member to take in the
  specified situation. If the server where you use the
  function is part of a group, it must be the current
  primary in a group in single-primary mode, and it must be
  part of the majority. The changed setting is propagated to
  other group members and joining members, so they will all
  act in the same way when they are in the specified
  situation, and you only need to use the function on the
  primary.

  Syntax:

  ```clike
  STRING group_replication_enable_member_action(name, event)
  ```

  Arguments:

  - *`name`*: The name of the
    member action to enable.
  - *`event`*: The event that
    triggers the member action.

  Return value:

  A string containing the result of the operation, for
  example whether it was successful or not.

  Example:

  ```sql
  SELECT group_replication_enable_member_action("mysql_disable_super_read_only_if_primary", "AFTER_PRIMARY_ELECTION");
  ```

  For more information, see
  [Section 20.5.1.5, “Configuring Member Actions”](group-replication-member-actions.md "20.5.1.5 Configuring Member Actions").
- [`group_replication_reset_member_actions()`](group-replication-functions-for-member-actions.md#function_group-replication-reset-member-actions)

  Reset the member actions configuration to the default
  settings, and reset its version number to 1.

  The
  [`group_replication_reset_member_actions()`](group-replication-functions-for-member-actions.md#function_group-replication-reset-member-actions)
  function can only be used on a server that is not
  currently part of a group. The server must be writeable
  (with the [`read_only`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_read_only)
  system variable set to `OFF`) and have
  the Group Replication plugin installed. You can use this
  function to remove the member actions configuration that a
  server used when it was part of a group, if you intend to
  use it as a standalone server with no member actions or
  different member actions.

  Syntax:

  ```clike
  STRING group_replication_reset_member_actions()
  ```

  Arguments:

  None.

  Return value:

  A string containing the result of the operation, for
  example whether it was successful or not.

  Example:

  ```sql
  SELECT group_replication_reset_member_actions();
  ```
