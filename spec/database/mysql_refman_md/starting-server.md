### 2.9.2 Starting the Server

[2.9.2.1 Troubleshooting Problems Starting the MySQL Server](starting-server-troubleshooting.md)

This section describes how start the server on Unix and Unix-like
systems. (For Windows, see
[Section 2.3.4.5, “Starting the Server for the First Time”](windows-server-first-start.md "2.3.4.5 Starting the Server for the First Time").) For some suggested
commands that you can use to test whether the server is accessible
and working properly, see [Section 2.9.3, “Testing the Server”](testing-server.md "2.9.3 Testing the Server").

Start the MySQL server like this if your installation includes
[**mysqld\_safe**](mysqld-safe.md "6.3.2 mysqld_safe — MySQL Server Startup Script"):

```terminal
$> bin/mysqld_safe --user=mysql &
```

Note

For Linux systems on which MySQL is installed using RPM
packages, server startup and shutdown is managed using systemd
rather than [**mysqld\_safe**](mysqld-safe.md "6.3.2 mysqld_safe — MySQL Server Startup Script"), and
[**mysqld\_safe**](mysqld-safe.md "6.3.2 mysqld_safe — MySQL Server Startup Script") is not installed. See
[Section 2.5.9, “Managing MySQL Server with systemd”](using-systemd.md "2.5.9 Managing MySQL Server with systemd").

Start the server like this if your installation includes systemd
support:

```terminal
$> systemctl start mysqld
```

Substitute the appropriate service name if it differs from
`mysqld` (for example, `mysql`
on SLES systems).

It is important that the MySQL server be run using an unprivileged
(non-`root`) login account. To ensure this, run
[**mysqld\_safe**](mysqld-safe.md "6.3.2 mysqld_safe — MySQL Server Startup Script") as `root` and
include the [`--user`](mysqld-safe.md#option_mysqld_safe_user) option as
shown. Otherwise, you should execute the program while logged in
as `mysql`, in which case you can omit the
[`--user`](mysqld-safe.md#option_mysqld_safe_user) option from the
command.

For further instructions for running MySQL as an unprivileged
user, see [Section 8.1.5, “How to Run MySQL as a Normal User”](changing-mysql-user.md "8.1.5 How to Run MySQL as a Normal User").

If the command fails immediately and prints `mysqld
ended`, look for information in the error log (which by
default is the
`host_name.err` file
in the data directory).

If the server is unable to access the data directory it starts or
read the grant tables in the `mysql` schema, it
writes a message to its error log. Such problems can occur if you
neglected to create the grant tables by initializing the data
directory before proceeding to this step, or if you ran the
command that initializes the data directory without the
`--user` option. Remove the
`data` directory and run the command with the
`--user` option.

If you have other problems starting the server, see
[Section 2.9.2.1, “Troubleshooting Problems Starting the MySQL Server”](starting-server-troubleshooting.md "2.9.2.1 Troubleshooting Problems Starting the MySQL Server"). For more
information about [**mysqld\_safe**](mysqld-safe.md "6.3.2 mysqld_safe — MySQL Server Startup Script"), see
[Section 6.3.2, “mysqld\_safe — MySQL Server Startup Script”](mysqld-safe.md "6.3.2 mysqld_safe — MySQL Server Startup Script"). For more information about systemd
support, see [Section 2.5.9, “Managing MySQL Server with systemd”](using-systemd.md "2.5.9 Managing MySQL Server with systemd").
