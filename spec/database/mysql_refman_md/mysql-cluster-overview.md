[25.2.7 Known Limitations of NDB Cluster](mysql-cluster-limitations.md)

NDB Cluster is a technology
that enables clustering of in-memory databases in a shared-nothing
system. The shared-nothing architecture enables the system to work
with very inexpensive hardware, and with a minimum of specific
requirements for hardware or software.

NDB Cluster is designed not to have any single point of failure. In
a shared-nothing system, each component is expected to have its own
memory and disk, and the use of shared storage mechanisms such as
network shares, network file systems, and SANs is not recommended or
supported.

NDB Cluster integrates the standard MySQL server with an in-memory
clustered storage engine called [`NDB`](mysql-cluster.md "Chapter 25 MySQL NDB Cluster 8.0")
(which stands for “*N*etwork
*D*ata*B*ase”). In our
documentation, the term [`NDB`](mysql-cluster.md "Chapter 25 MySQL NDB Cluster 8.0") refers to
the part of the setup that is specific to the storage engine,
whereas “MySQL NDB Cluster” refers to the combination
of one or more MySQL servers with the
[`NDB`](mysql-cluster.md "Chapter 25 MySQL NDB Cluster 8.0") storage engine.

An NDB Cluster consists of a set of computers, known as
hosts, each running one or
more processes. These processes, known as
nodes, may include MySQL
servers (for access to NDB data), data nodes (for storage of the
data), one or more management servers, and possibly other
specialized data access programs. The relationship of these
components in an NDB Cluster is shown here:

**Figure 25.1 NDB Cluster Components**

![In this cluster, three MySQL servers (mysqld program) are SQL nodes that provide access to four data nodes (ndbd program) that store data. The SQL nodes and data nodes are under the control of an NDB management server (ndb_mgmd program). Various clients and APIs can interact with the SQL nodes - the mysql client, the MySQL C API, PHP, Connector/J, and Connector/NET. Custom clients can also be created using the NDB API to interact with the data nodes or the NDB management server. The NDB management client (ndb_mgm program) interacts with the NDB management server.](images/cluster-components-1.png)

All these programs work together to form an NDB Cluster (see
[Section 25.5, “NDB Cluster Programs”](mysql-cluster-programs.md "25.5 NDB Cluster Programs"). When data is stored by the
[`NDB`](mysql-cluster.md "Chapter 25 MySQL NDB Cluster 8.0") storage engine, the tables (and
table data) are stored in the data nodes. Such tables are directly
accessible from all other MySQL servers (SQL nodes) in the cluster.
Thus, in a payroll application storing data in a cluster, if one
application updates the salary of an employee, all other MySQL
servers that query this data can see this change immediately.

As of NDB 8.0.31, an NDB Cluster 8.0 SQL node uses the
[**mysqld**](mysqld.md "6.3.1 mysqld — The MySQL Server") server daemon which is the same as the
[**mysqld**](mysqld.md "6.3.1 mysqld — The MySQL Server") supplied with MySQL Server
8.0 distributions. In NDB 8.0.30 and previous releases,
it differed in a number of critical respects from the
[**mysqld**](mysqld.md "6.3.1 mysqld — The MySQL Server") binary supplied with MySQL Server, and the
two versions of [**mysqld**](mysqld.md "6.3.1 mysqld — The MySQL Server") were not interchangeable.
You should keep in mind that *an instance of
[**mysqld**](mysqld.md "6.3.1 mysqld — The MySQL Server"), regardless of version, that is not
connected to an NDB Cluster cannot use the
[`NDB`](mysql-cluster.md "Chapter 25 MySQL NDB Cluster 8.0") storage engine and cannot access
any NDB Cluster data*.

The data stored in the data nodes for NDB Cluster can be mirrored;
the cluster can handle failures of individual data nodes with no
other impact than that a small number of transactions are aborted
due to losing the transaction state. Because transactional
applications are expected to handle transaction failure, this should
not be a source of problems.

Individual nodes can be stopped and restarted, and can then rejoin
the system (cluster). Rolling restarts (in which all nodes are
restarted in turn) are used in making configuration changes and
software upgrades (see
[Section 25.6.5, “Performing a Rolling Restart of an NDB Cluster”](mysql-cluster-rolling-restart.md "25.6.5 Performing a Rolling Restart of an NDB Cluster")). Rolling restarts
are also used as part of the process of adding new data nodes online
(see [Section 25.6.7, “Adding NDB Cluster Data Nodes Online”](mysql-cluster-online-add-node.md "25.6.7 Adding NDB Cluster Data Nodes Online")). For more
information about data nodes, how they are organized in an NDB
Cluster, and how they handle and store NDB Cluster data, see
[Section 25.2.2, “NDB Cluster Nodes, Node Groups, Fragment Replicas, and Partitions”](mysql-cluster-nodes-groups.md "25.2.2 NDB Cluster Nodes, Node Groups, Fragment Replicas, and Partitions").

Backing up and restoring NDB Cluster databases can be done using the
`NDB`-native functionality found in the NDB Cluster
management client and the [**ndb\_restore**](mysql-cluster-programs-ndb-restore.md "25.5.23 ndb_restore — Restore an NDB Cluster Backup") program
included in the NDB Cluster distribution. For more information, see
[Section 25.6.8, “Online Backup of NDB Cluster”](mysql-cluster-backup.md "25.6.8 Online Backup of NDB Cluster"), and
[Section 25.5.23, “ndb\_restore — Restore an NDB Cluster Backup”](mysql-cluster-programs-ndb-restore.md "25.5.23 ndb_restore — Restore an NDB Cluster Backup"). You can also
use the standard MySQL functionality provided for this purpose in
[**mysqldump**](mysqldump.md "6.5.4 mysqldump — A Database Backup Program") and the MySQL server. See
[Section 6.5.4, “mysqldump — A Database Backup Program”](mysqldump.md "6.5.4 mysqldump — A Database Backup Program"), for more information.

NDB Cluster nodes can employ different transport mechanisms for
inter-node communications; TCP/IP over standard 100 Mbps or faster
Ethernet hardware is used in most real-world deployments.
