#### 14.16.9.1 Spatial Relation Functions That Use Object Shapes

The OpenGIS specification defines the following functions to
test the relationship between two geometry values
*`g1`* and *`g2`*,
using precise object shapes. The return values 1 and 0 indicate
true and false, respectively, except that distance functions
return distance values.

Functions in this section detect arguments in either Cartesian
or geographic spatial reference systems (SRSs), and return
results appropriate to the SRS.

Unless otherwise specified, functions in this section handle
their geometry arguments as follows:

- If any argument is `NULL` or any geometry
  argument is an empty geometry, the return value is
  `NULL`.
- If any geometry argument is not a syntactically well-formed
  geometry, an
  [`ER_GIS_INVALID_DATA`](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/mysql-errors/8.0/en/server-error-reference.html#error_er_gis_invalid_data) error
  occurs.
- If any geometry argument is a syntactically well-formed
  geometry in an undefined spatial reference system (SRS), an
  [`ER_SRS_NOT_FOUND`](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/mysql-errors/8.0/en/server-error-reference.html#error_er_srs_not_found) error
  occurs.
- For functions that take multiple geometry arguments, if
  those arguments are not in the same SRS, an
  [`ER_GIS_DIFFERENT_SRIDS`](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/mysql-errors/8.0/en/server-error-reference.html#error_er_gis_different_srids) error
  occurs.
- If any geometry argument is geometrically invalid, either
  the result is true or false (it is undefined which), or an
  error occurs.
- For geographic SRS geometry arguments, if any argument has a
  longitude or latitude that is out of range, an error occurs:

  - If a longitude value is not in the range (−180,
    180], an
    [`ER_GEOMETRY_PARAM_LONGITUDE_OUT_OF_RANGE`](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/mysql-errors/8.0/en/server-error-reference.html#error_er_geometry_param_longitude_out_of_range)
    error occurs
    ([`ER_LONGITUDE_OUT_OF_RANGE`](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/mysql-errors/8.0/en/server-error-reference.html#error_er_longitude_out_of_range)
    prior to MySQL 8.0.12).
  - If a latitude value is not in the range [−90, 90],
    an
    [`ER_GEOMETRY_PARAM_LATITUDE_OUT_OF_RANGE`](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/mysql-errors/8.0/en/server-error-reference.html#error_er_geometry_param_latitude_out_of_range)
    error occurs
    ([`ER_LATITUDE_OUT_OF_RANGE`](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/mysql-errors/8.0/en/server-error-reference.html#error_er_latitude_out_of_range)
    prior to MySQL 8.0.12).

  Ranges shown are in degrees. If an SRS uses another unit,
  the range uses the corresponding values in its unit. The
  exact range limits deviate slightly due to floating-point
  arithmetic.
- Otherwise, the return value is non-`NULL`.

Some functions in this section permit a unit argument that
specifies the length unit for the return value. Unless otherwise
specified, functions handle their unit argument as follows:

- A unit is supported if it is found in the
  `INFORMATION_SCHEMA`
  [`ST_UNITS_OF_MEASURE`](information-schema-st-units-of-measure-table.md "28.3.37 The INFORMATION_SCHEMA ST_UNITS_OF_MEASURE Table") table. See
  [Section 28.3.37, “The INFORMATION\_SCHEMA ST\_UNITS\_OF\_MEASURE Table”](information-schema-st-units-of-measure-table.md "28.3.37 The INFORMATION_SCHEMA ST_UNITS_OF_MEASURE Table").
- If a unit is specified but not supported by MySQL, an
  [`ER_UNIT_NOT_FOUND`](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/mysql-errors/8.0/en/server-error-reference.html#error_er_unit_not_found) error
  occurs.
- If a supported linear unit is specified and the SRID is 0,
  an
  [`ER_GEOMETRY_IN_UNKNOWN_LENGTH_UNIT`](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/mysql-errors/8.0/en/server-error-reference.html#error_er_geometry_in_unknown_length_unit)
  error occurs.
- If a supported linear unit is specified and the SRID is not
  0, the result is in that unit.
- If a unit is not specified, the result is in the unit of the
  SRS of the geometries, whether Cartesian or geographic.
  Currently, all MySQL SRSs are expressed in meters.

These object-shape functions are available for testing geometry
relationships:

- [`ST_Contains(g1,
  g2)`](spatial-relation-functions-object-shapes.md#function_st-contains)

  Returns 1 or 0 to indicate whether
  *`g1`* completely contains
  *`g2`* (this means that
  *`g1`* and
  *`g2`* must not intersect). This
  relationship is the inverse of that tested by
  [`ST_Within()`](spatial-relation-functions-object-shapes.md#function_st-within).

  [`ST_Contains()`](spatial-relation-functions-object-shapes.md#function_st-contains) handles its
  arguments as described in the introduction to this section.

  ```sql
  mysql> SET @g1 = ST_GeomFromText('Polygon((0 0,0 3,3 3,3 0,0 0))'),
      ->     @p1 = ST_GeomFromText('Point(1 1)'),
      ->     @p2 = ST_GeomFromText('Point(3 3)'),
      ->     @p3 = ST_GeomFromText('Point(5 5)');
  Query OK, 0 rows affected (0.00 sec)

  mysql> SELECT
      ->   ST_Contains(@g1, @p1), ST_Within(@p1, @g1),
      ->   ST_Disjoint(@g1, @p1), ST_Intersects(@g1, @p1)\G

  1 row in set (0.00 sec)
  ```
- [`ST_Crosses(g1,
  g2)`](spatial-relation-functions-object-shapes.md#function_st-crosses)

  Two geometries *spatially cross* if their
  spatial relation has the following properties:

  - Unless *`g1`* and
    *`g2`* are both of dimension 1:
    *`g1`* crosses
    *`g2`* if the interior of
    *`g2`* has points in common with
    the interior of *`g1`*, but
    *`g2`* does not cover the entire
    interior of *`g1`*.
  - If both *`g1`* and
    *`g2`* are of dimension 1: If the
    lines cross each other in a finite number of points
    (that is, no common line segments, only single points in
    common).

  This function returns 1 or 0 to indicate whether
  *`g1`* spatially crosses
  *`g2`*.

  [`ST_Crosses()`](spatial-relation-functions-object-shapes.md#function_st-crosses) handles its
  arguments as described in the introduction to this section
  except that the return value is `NULL` for
  these additional conditions:

  - *`g1`* is of dimension 2
    (`Polygon` or
    `MultiPolygon`).
  - *`g2`* is of dimension 1
    (`Point` or
    `MultiPoint`).
- [`ST_Disjoint(g1,
  g2)`](spatial-relation-functions-object-shapes.md#function_st-disjoint)

  Returns 1 or 0 to indicate whether
  *`g1`* is spatially disjoint from
  (does not intersect) *`g2`*.

  [`ST_Disjoint()`](spatial-relation-functions-object-shapes.md#function_st-disjoint) handles its
  arguments as described in the introduction to this section.
- [`ST_Distance(g1,
  g2 [,
  unit])`](spatial-relation-functions-object-shapes.md#function_st-distance)

  Returns the distance between *`g1`*
  and *`g2`*, measured in the length
  unit of the spatial reference system (SRS) of the geometry
  arguments, or in the unit of the optional
  *`unit`* argument if that is
  specified.

  This function processes geometry collections by returning
  the shortest distance among all combinations of the
  components of the two geometry arguments.

  [`ST_Distance()`](spatial-relation-functions-object-shapes.md#function_st-distance) handles its
  geometry arguments as described in the introduction to this
  section, with these exceptions:

  - [`ST_Distance()`](spatial-relation-functions-object-shapes.md#function_st-distance) detects
    arguments in a geographic (ellipsoidal) spatial
    reference system and returns the geodetic distance on
    the ellipsoid. As of MySQL 8.0.18,
    [`ST_Distance()`](spatial-relation-functions-object-shapes.md#function_st-distance) supports
    distance calculations for geographic SRS arguments of
    all geometry types. Prior to MySQL 8.0.18, the only
    permitted geographic argument types are
    `Point` and `Point`,
    or `Point` and
    `MultiPoint` (in any argument order).
    If called with other geometry type argument combinations
    in a geographic SRS, an
    [`ER_NOT_IMPLEMENTED_FOR_GEOGRAPHIC_SRS`](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/mysql-errors/8.0/en/server-error-reference.html#error_er_not_implemented_for_geographic_srs)
    error occurs.
  - If any argument is geometrically invalid, either the
    result is an undefined distance (that is, it can be any
    number), or an error occurs.
  - If an intermediate or final result produces
    `NaN` or a negative number, an
    [`ER_GIS_INVALID_DATA`](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/mysql-errors/8.0/en/server-error-reference.html#error_er_gis_invalid_data)
    error occurs.

  As of MySQL 8.0.14,
  [`ST_Distance()`](spatial-relation-functions-object-shapes.md#function_st-distance) permits an
  optional *`unit`* argument that
  specifies the linear unit for the returned distance value.
  [`ST_Distance()`](spatial-relation-functions-object-shapes.md#function_st-distance) handles its
  *`unit`* argument as described in the
  introduction to this section.

  ```sql
  mysql> SET @g1 = ST_GeomFromText('POINT(1 1)');
  mysql> SET @g2 = ST_GeomFromText('POINT(2 2)');
  mysql> SELECT ST_Distance(@g1, @g2);
  +-----------------------+
  | ST_Distance(@g1, @g2) |
  +-----------------------+
  |    1.4142135623730951 |

  mysql> SET @g1 = ST_GeomFromText('POINT(1 1)', 4326);
  mysql> SET @g2 = ST_GeomFromText('POINT(2 2)', 4326);
  mysql> SELECT ST_Distance(@g1, @g2);
  +-----------------------+
  | ST_Distance(@g1, @g2) |

  +-------------------------------+
  ```

  For the special case of distance calculations on a sphere,
  see the [`ST_Distance_Sphere()`](spatial-convenience-functions.md#function_st-distance-sphere)
  function.
- [`ST_Equals(g1,
  g2)`](spatial-relation-functions-object-shapes.md#function_st-equals)

  Returns 1 or 0 to indicate whether
  *`g1`* is spatially equal to
  *`g2`*.

  [`ST_Equals()`](spatial-relation-functions-object-shapes.md#function_st-equals) handles its
  arguments as described in the introduction to this section,
  except that it does not return `NULL` for
  empty geometry arguments.

  ```sql
  mysql> SET @g1 = Point(1,1), @g2 = Point(2,2);
  mysql> SELECT ST_Equals(@g1, @g1), ST_Equals(@g1, @g2);
  +---------------------+---------------------+
  | ST_Equals(@g1, @g1) | ST_Equals(@g1, @g2) |
  +---------------------+---------------------+
  |                   1 |                   0 |
  +---------------------+---------------------+
  ```
- [`ST_FrechetDistance(g1,
  g2 [,
  unit])`](spatial-relation-functions-object-shapes.md#function_st-frechetdistance)

  Returns the discrete Fréchet distance between two
  geometries, reflecting how similar the geometries are. The
  result is a double-precision number measured in the length
  unit of the spatial reference system (SRS) of the geometry
  arguments, or in the length unit of the
  *`unit`* argument if that argument is
  given.

  This function implements the discrete Fréchet distance,
  which means it is restricted to distances between the points
  of the geometries. For example, given two
  `LineString` arguments, only the points
  explicitly mentioned in the geometries are considered.
  Points on the line segments between these points are not
  considered.

  [`ST_FrechetDistance()`](spatial-relation-functions-object-shapes.md#function_st-frechetdistance) handles
  its geometry arguments as described in the introduction to
  this section, with these exceptions:

  - The geometries may have a Cartesian or geographic SRS,
    but only `LineString` values are
    supported. If the arguments are in the same Cartesian or
    geographic SRS, but either is not a
    `LineString`, an
    [`ER_NOT_IMPLEMENTED_FOR_CARTESIAN_SRS`](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/mysql-errors/8.0/en/server-error-reference.html#error_er_not_implemented_for_cartesian_srs)

    [`ER_NOT_IMPLEMENTED_FOR_GEOGRAPHIC_SRS`](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/mysql-errors/8.0/en/server-error-reference.html#error_er_not_implemented_for_geographic_srs)
    error occurs, depending on the SRS type.

  [`ST_FrechetDistance()`](spatial-relation-functions-object-shapes.md#function_st-frechetdistance) handles
  its optional *`unit`* argument as
  described in the introduction to this section.

  ```sql
  mysql> SET @ls1 = ST_GeomFromText('LINESTRING(0 0,0 5,5 5)');

  This function was added in MySQL 8.0.23.
- [`ST_HausdorffDistance(g1,
  g2 [,
  unit])`](spatial-relation-functions-object-shapes.md#function_st-hausdorffdistance)

  Returns the discrete Hausdorff distance between two
  geometries, reflecting how similar the geometries are. The
  result is a double-precision number measured in the length
  unit of the spatial reference system (SRS) of the geometry
  arguments, or in the length unit of the
  *`unit`* argument if that argument is
  given.

  This function implements the discrete Hausdorff distance,
  which means it is restricted to distances between the points
  of the geometries. For example, given two
  `LineString` arguments, only the points
  explicitly mentioned in the geometries are considered.
  Points on the line segments between these points are not
  considered.

  [`ST_HausdorffDistance()`](spatial-relation-functions-object-shapes.md#function_st-hausdorffdistance)
  handles its geometry arguments as described in the
  introduction to this section, with these exceptions:

  - If the geometry arguments are in the same Cartesian or
    geographic SRS, but are not in a supported combination,
    an
    [`ER_NOT_IMPLEMENTED_FOR_CARTESIAN_SRS`](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/mysql-errors/8.0/en/server-error-reference.html#error_er_not_implemented_for_cartesian_srs)

    [`ER_NOT_IMPLEMENTED_FOR_GEOGRAPHIC_SRS`](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/mysql-errors/8.0/en/server-error-reference.html#error_er_not_implemented_for_geographic_srs)
    error occurs, depending on the SRS type. These
    combinations are supported:

    - `LineString` and
      `LineString`
    - `Point` and
      `MultiPoint`
    - `LineString` and
      `MultiLineString`
    - `MultiPoint` and

  [`ST_HausdorffDistance()`](spatial-relation-functions-object-shapes.md#function_st-hausdorffdistance)
  handles its optional *`unit`*
  argument as described in the introduction to this section.

  Two geometries *spatially overlap* if
  they intersect and their intersection results in a geometry
  of the same dimension but not equal to either of the given
  geometries.

  This function returns 1 or 0 to indicate whether
