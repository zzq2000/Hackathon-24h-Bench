#### 7.4.2.6 Rule-Based Error Log Filtering (log\_filter\_dragnet)

The `log_filter_dragnet` log filter component
enables log filtering based on user-defined rules.

To enable the `log_filter_dragnet` filter,
first load the filter component, then modify the
[`log_error_services`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_log_error_services) value. The
following example enables `log_filter_dragnet`
in combination with the built-in log sink:

```sql
INSTALL COMPONENT 'file://component_log_filter_dragnet';
SET GLOBAL log_error_services = 'log_filter_dragnet; log_sink_internal';
```

To set [`log_error_services`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_log_error_services) to
take effect at server startup, use the instructions at
[Section 7.4.2.1, “Error Log Configuration”](error-log-configuration.md "7.4.2.1 Error Log Configuration"). Those instructions
apply to other error-logging system variables as well.

With `log_filter_dragnet` enabled, define its
filter rules by setting the
[`dragnet.log_error_filter_rules`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_dragnet.log_error_filter_rules)
system variable. A rule set consists of zero or more rules,
where each rule is an `IF` statement terminated
by a period (`.`) character. If the variable
value is empty (zero rules), no filtering occurs.

Example 1. This rule set drops information events, and, for
other events, removes the `source_line` field:

```sql
SET GLOBAL dragnet.log_error_filter_rules =
  'IF prio>=INFORMATION THEN drop. IF EXISTS source_line THEN unset source_line.';
```

The effect is similar to the filtering performed by the
`log_sink_internal` filter with a setting of
[`log_error_verbosity=2`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_log_error_verbosity).

For readability, you might find it preferable to list the rules
on separate lines. For example:

```sql
SET GLOBAL dragnet.log_error_filter_rules = '
  IF prio>=INFORMATION THEN drop.
  IF EXISTS source_line THEN unset source_line.
';
```

Example 2: This rule limits information events to no more than
one per 60 seconds:

```sql
SET GLOBAL dragnet.log_error_filter_rules =
  'IF prio>=INFORMATION THEN throttle 1/60.';
```

Once you have the filtering configuration set up as you desire,
consider assigning
[`dragnet.log_error_filter_rules`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_dragnet.log_error_filter_rules)
using [`SET
PERSIST`](set-variable.md "15.7.6.1 SET Syntax for Variable Assignment") rather than
[`SET
GLOBAL`](set-variable.md "15.7.6.1 SET Syntax for Variable Assignment") to make the setting persist across server
restarts. Alternatively, add the setting to the server option
file.

When using `log_filter_dragnet`,
[`log_error_suppression_list`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_log_error_suppression_list) is
ignored.

To stop using the filtering language, first remove it from the
set of error logging components. Usually this means using a
different filter component rather than no filter component. For
example:

```sql
SET GLOBAL log_error_services = 'log_filter_internal; log_sink_internal';
```

Again, consider using
[`SET
PERSIST`](set-variable.md "15.7.6.1 SET Syntax for Variable Assignment") rather than
[`SET
GLOBAL`](set-variable.md "15.7.6.1 SET Syntax for Variable Assignment") to make the setting persist across server
restarts.

Then uninstall the filter `log_filter_dragnet`
component:

```sql
UNINSTALL COMPONENT 'file://component_log_filter_dragnet';
```

The following sections describe aspects of
`log_filter_dragnet` operation in more detail:

- [Grammar for log\_filter\_dragnet Rule Language](error-log-rule-based-filtering.md#error-log-dragnet-filtering-language "Grammar for log_filter_dragnet Rule Language")
- [Actions for log\_filter\_dragnet Rules](error-log-rule-based-filtering.md#error-log-dragnet-filtering-actions "Actions for log_filter_dragnet Rules")
- [Field References in log\_filter\_dragnet Rules](error-log-rule-based-filtering.md#error-log-dragnet-filtering-fields "Field References in log_filter_dragnet Rules")

##### Grammar for log\_filter\_dragnet Rule Language

The following grammar defines the language for
`log_filter_dragnet` filter rules. Each rule
is an `IF` statement terminated by a period
(`.`) character. The language is not
case-sensitive.

```simple
rule:
    IF condition THEN action
    [ELSEIF condition THEN action] ...
    [ELSE action]
    .

condition: {
    field comparator value
  | [NOT] EXISTS field
  | condition {AND | OR}  condition
}

action: {
    drop
  | throttle {count | count / window_size}
  | set field [:= | =] value
  | unset [field]
}

field: {
    core_field
  | optional_field
  | user_defined_field
}

core_field: {
    time
  | msg
  | prio
  | err_code
  | err_symbol
  | SQL_state
  | subsystem
}

optional_field: {
    OS_errno
  | OS_errmsg
  | label
  | user
  | host
  | thread
  | query_id
  | source_file
  | source_line
  | function
  | component
}

user_defined_field:
    sequence of characters in [a-zA-Z0-9_] class

comparator: {== | != | <> | >= | => | <= | =< | < | >}

value: {
    string_literal
  | integer_literal
  | float_literal
  | error_symbol
  | priority
}

count: integer_literal
window_size: integer_literal

string_literal:
    sequence of characters quoted as '...' or "..."

integer_literal:
    sequence of characters in [0-9] class

float_literal:
    integer_literal[.integer_literal]

error_symbol:
    valid MySQL error symbol such as ER_ACCESS_DENIED_ERROR or ER_STARTUP

priority: {
    ERROR
  | WARNING
  | INFORMATION
}
```

Simple conditions compare a field to a value or test field
existence. To construct more complex conditions, use the
`AND` and `OR` operators.
Both operators have the same precedence and evaluate left to
right.

To escape a character within a string, precede it by a
backslash (`\`). A backslash is required to
include backslash itself or the string-quoting character,
optional for other characters.

For convenience, `log_filter_dragnet`
supports symbolic names for comparisons to certain fields. For
readability and portability, symbolic values are preferable
(where applicable) to numeric values.

- Event priority values 1, 2, and 3 can be specified as
  `ERROR`, `WARNING`, and
  `INFORMATION`. Priority symbols are
  recognized only in comparisons with the
  `prio` field. These comparisons are
  equivalent:

  ```sql
  IF prio == INFORMATION THEN ...
  IF prio == 3 THEN ...
  ```
- Error codes can be specified in numeric form or as the
  corresponding error symbol. For example,
  [`ER_STARTUP`](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/mysql-errors/8.0/en/server-error-reference.html#error_er_startup) is the symbolic
  name for error `1408`, so these
  comparisons are equivalent:

  ```sql
  IF err_code == ER_STARTUP THEN ...
  IF err_code == 1408 THEN ...
  ```

  Error symbols are recognized only in comparisons with the
  `err_code` field and user-defined fields.

  To find the error symbol corresponding to a given error
  code number, use one of these methods:

  - Check the list of server errors at
    [Server Error Message Reference](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/mysql-errors/8.0/en/server-error-reference.html).
  - Use the [**perror**](perror.md "6.8.2 perror — Display MySQL Error Message Information") command. Given an
    error number argument, [**perror**](perror.md "6.8.2 perror — Display MySQL Error Message Information")
    displays information about the error, including its
    symbol.

  Suppose that a rule set with error numbers looks like
  this:

  ```sql
  IF err_code == 10927 OR err_code == 10914 THEN drop.
  IF err_code == 1131 THEN drop.
  ```

  Using [**perror**](perror.md "6.8.2 perror — Display MySQL Error Message Information"), determine the error
  symbols:

  ```terminal
  $> perror 10927 10914 1131
  MySQL error code MY-010927 (ER_ACCESS_DENIED_FOR_USER_ACCOUNT_LOCKED):
  Access denied for user '%-.48s'@'%-.64s'. Account is locked.
  MySQL error code MY-010914 (ER_ABORTING_USER_CONNECTION):
  Aborted connection %u to db: '%-.192s' user: '%-.48s' host:
  '%-.64s' (%-.64s).
  MySQL error code MY-001131 (ER_PASSWORD_ANONYMOUS_USER):
  You are using MySQL as an anonymous user and anonymous users
  are not allowed to change passwords
  ```

  Substituting error symbols for numbers, the rule set
  becomes:

  ```sql
  IF err_code == ER_ACCESS_DENIED_FOR_USER_ACCOUNT_LOCKED
    OR err_code == ER_ABORTING_USER_CONNECTION THEN drop.
  IF err_code == ER_PASSWORD_ANONYMOUS_USER THEN drop.
  ```

Symbolic names can be specified as quoted strings for
comparison with string fields, but in such cases the names are
strings that have no special meaning and
`log_filter_dragnet` does not resolve them to
the corresponding numeric value. Also, typos may go
undetected, whereas an error occurs immediately on
`SET` for attempts to use an unquoted symbol
unknown to the server.

##### Actions for log\_filter\_dragnet Rules

`log_filter_dragnet` supports these actions
in filter rules:

- `drop`: Drop the current log event (do
  not log it).
- `throttle`: Apply rate limiting to reduce
  log verbosity for events matching particular conditions.
  The argument indicates a rate, in the form
  *`count`* or
  *`count`*/*`window_size`*.
  The *`count`* value indicates the
  permitted number of event occurrences to log per time
  window. The *`window_size`* value
  is the time window in seconds; if omitted, the default
  window is 60 seconds. Both values must be integer
  literals.

  This rule throttles plugin-shutdown messages to 5
  occurrences per 60 seconds:

  ```sql
  IF err_code == ER_PLUGIN_SHUTTING_DOWN_PLUGIN THEN throttle 5.
  ```

  This rule throttles errors and warnings to 1000
  occurrences per hour and information messages to 100
  occurrences per hour:

  ```sql
  IF prio <= INFORMATION THEN throttle 1000/3600 ELSE throttle 100/3600.
  ```
- `set`: Assign a value to a field (and
  cause the field to exist if it did not already). In
  subsequent rules, `EXISTS` tests against
  the field name are true, and the new value can be tested
  by comparison conditions.
- `unset`: Discard a field. In subsequent
  rules, `EXISTS` tests against the field
  name are false, and comparisons of the field against any
  value are false.

  In the special case that the condition refers to exactly
  one field name, the field name following
  `unset` is optional and
  `unset` discards the named field. These
  rules are equivalent:

  ```sql
  IF myfield == 2 THEN unset myfield.
  IF myfield == 2 THEN unset.
  ```

##### Field References in log\_filter\_dragnet Rules

`log_filter_dragnet` rules support references
to core, optional, and user-defined fields in error events.

- [Core Field References](error-log-rule-based-filtering.md#error-log-dragnet-core-field-references "Core Field References")
- [Optional Field References](error-log-rule-based-filtering.md#error-log-dragnet-optional-field-references "Optional Field References")
- [User-Defined Field References](error-log-rule-based-filtering.md#error-log-dragnet-user-defined-field-references "User-Defined Field References")

###### Core Field References

The `log_filter_dragnet` grammar at
[Grammar for log\_filter\_dragnet Rule Language](error-log-rule-based-filtering.md#error-log-dragnet-filtering-language "Grammar for log_filter_dragnet Rule Language") names
the core fields that filter rules recognize. For general
descriptions of these fields, see
[Section 7.4.2.3, “Error Event Fields”](error-log-event-fields.md "7.4.2.3 Error Event Fields"), with which you are
assumed to be familiar. The following remarks provide
additional information only as it pertains specifically to
core field references as used within
`log_filter_dragnet` rules.

- `prio`

  The event priority, to indicate an error, warning, or
  note/information event. In comparisons, each priority can
  be specified as a symbolic priority name or an integer
  literal. Priority symbols are recognized only in
  comparisons with the `prio` field. These
  comparisons are equivalent:

  ```sql
  IF prio == INFORMATION THEN ...
  IF prio == 3 THEN ...
  ```

  The following table shows the permitted priority levels.

  | Event Type | Priority Symbol | Numeric Priority |
  | --- | --- | --- |
  | Error event | `ERROR` | 1 |
  | Warning event | `WARNING` | 2 |
  | Note/information event | `INFORMATION` | 3 |

  There is also a message priority of
  `SYSTEM`, but system messages cannot be
  filtered and are always written to the error log.

  Priority values follow the principle that higher
  priorities have lower values, and vice versa. Priority
  values begin at 1 for the most severe events (errors) and
  increase for events with decreasing priority. For example,
  to discard events with priority lower than warnings, test
  for priority values higher than
  `WARNING`:

  ```sql
  IF prio > WARNING THEN drop.
  ```

  The following examples show the
  `log_filter_dragnet` rules to achieve an
  effect similar to each
  [`log_error_verbosity`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_log_error_verbosity) value
  permitted by the `log_filter_internal`
  filter:

  - Errors only
    (`log_error_verbosity=1`):

    ```sql
    IF prio > ERROR THEN drop.
    ```
  - Errors and warnings
    (`log_error_verbosity=2`):

    ```sql
    IF prio > WARNING THEN drop.
    ```
  - Errors, warnings, and notes
    (`log_error_verbosity=3`):

    ```sql
    IF prio > INFORMATION THEN drop.
    ```

    This rule can actually be omitted because there are no
    `prio` values greater than
    `INFORMATION`, so effectively it
    drops nothing.
- `err_code`

  The numeric event error code. In comparisons, the value to
  test can be specified as a symbolic error name or an
  integer literal. Error symbols are recognized only in
  comparisons with the `err_code` field and
  user-defined fields. These comparisons are equivalent:

  ```sql
  IF err_code == ER_ACCESS_DENIED_ERROR THEN ...
  IF err_code == 1045 THEN ...
  ```
- `err_symbol`

  The event error symbol, as a string (for example,
  [`'ER_DUP_KEY'`](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/mysql-errors/8.0/en/server-error-reference.html#error_er_dup_key)).
  `err_symbol` values are intended more for
  identifying particular lines in log output than for use in
  filter rule comparisons because
  `log_filter_dragnet` does not resolve
  comparison values specified as strings to the equivalent
  numeric error code. (For that to occur, an error must be
  specified using its unquoted symbol.)

###### Optional Field References

The `log_filter_dragnet` grammar at
[Grammar for log\_filter\_dragnet Rule Language](error-log-rule-based-filtering.md#error-log-dragnet-filtering-language "Grammar for log_filter_dragnet Rule Language") names
the optional fields that filter rules recognize. For general
descriptions of these fields, see
[Section 7.4.2.3, “Error Event Fields”](error-log-event-fields.md "7.4.2.3 Error Event Fields"), with which you are
assumed to be familiar. The following remarks provide
additional information only as it pertains specifically to
optional field references as used within
`log_filter_dragnet` rules.

- `label`

  The label corresponding to the `prio`
  value, as a string. Filter rules can change the label for
  log sinks that support custom labels.
  `label` values are intended more for
  identifying particular lines in log output than for use in
  filter rule comparisons because
  `log_filter_dragnet` does not resolve
  comparison values specified as strings to the equivalent
  numeric priority.
- `source_file`

  The source file in which the event occurred, without any
  leading path. For example, to test for the
  `sql/gis/distance.cc` file, write the
  comparison like this:

  ```sql
  IF source_file == "distance.cc" THEN ...
  ```

###### User-Defined Field References

Any field name in a `log_filter_dragnet`
filter rule not recognized as a core or optional field name is
taken to refer to a user-defined field.
