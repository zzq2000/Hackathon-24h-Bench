#### 19.2.5.4 Replication Channel Based Filters

This section explains how to work with replication filters when
multiple replication channels exist, for example in a
multi-source replication topology. Before MySQL 8.0, all
replication filters were global, so filters were applied to all
replication channels. From MySQL 8.0, replication filters can be
global or channel specific, enabling you to configure
multi-source replicas with replication filters on specific
replication channels. Channel specific replication filters are
particularly useful in a multi-source replication topology when
the same database or table is present on multiple sources, and
the replica is only required to replicate it from one source.

For instructions to set up replication channels, see
[Section 19.1.5, “MySQL Multi-Source Replication”](replication-multi-source.md "19.1.5 MySQL Multi-Source Replication"), and for more
information on how they work, see
[Section 19.2.2, “Replication Channels”](replication-channels.md "19.2.2 Replication Channels").

Important

Each channel on a multi-source replica must replicate from a
different source. You cannot set up multiple replication
channels from a single replica to a single source, even if you
use replication filters to select different data to replicate
on each channel. This is because the server IDs of replicas
must be unique in a replication topology. The source
distinguishes replicas only by their server IDs, not by the
names of the replication channels, so it cannot recognize
different replication channels from the same replica.

Important

On a MySQL server instance that is configured for Group
Replication, channel specific replication filters can be used
on replication channels that are not directly involved with
Group Replication, such as where a group member also acts as a
replica to a source that is outside the group. They cannot be
used on the `group_replication_applier` or
`group_replication_recovery` channels.
Filtering on these channels would make the group unable to
reach agreement on a consistent state.

Important

For a multi-source replica in a diamond topology (where the
replica replicates from two or more sources, which in turn
replicate from a common source), when GTID-based replication
is in use, ensure that any replication filters or other
channel configuration are identical on all channels on the
multi-source replica. With GTID-based replication, filters are
applied only to the transaction data, and GTIDs are not
filtered out. This happens so that a replica’s GTID set
stays consistent with the source’s, meaning GTID
auto-positioning can be used without re-acquiring filtered out
transactions each time. In the case where the downstream
replica is multi-source and receives the same transaction from
multiple sources in a diamond topology, the downstream replica
now has multiple versions of the transaction, and the result
depends on which channel applies the transaction first. The
second channel to attempt it skips the transaction using GTID
auto-skip, because the transaction’s GTID was added to the
[`gtid_executed`](replication-options-gtids.md#sysvar_gtid_executed) set by the
first channel. With identical filtering on the channels, there
is no problem because all versions of the transaction contain
the same data, so the results are the same. However, with
different filtering on the channels, the database can become
inconsistent and replication can hang.

##### Overview of Replication Filters and Channels

When multiple replication channels exist, for example in a
multi-source replication topology, replication filters are
applied as follows:

- Any global replication filter specified is added to the
  global replication filters of the filter type
  (`do_db`,
  `do_ignore_table`, and so on).
- Any channel specific replication filter adds the filter to
  the specified channel’s replication filters for the
  specified filter type.
- Each replication channel copies global replication filters
  to its channel specific replication filters if no channel
  specific replication filter of this type is configured.
- Each channel uses its channel specific replication filters
  to filter the replication stream.

The syntax to create channel specific replication filters
extends the existing SQL statements and command options. When
a replication channel is not specified the global replication
filter is configured to ensure backwards compatibility. The
[`CHANGE REPLICATION FILTER`](change-replication-filter.md "15.4.2.2 CHANGE REPLICATION FILTER Statement")
statement supports the `FOR CHANNEL` clause
to configure channel specific filters online. The
`--replicate-*` command options to configure
filters can specify a replication channel using the form
`--replicate-filter_type=channel_name:filter_details`.
Suppose channels `channel_1` and
`channel_2` exist before the server starts;
in this case, starting the replica with the command line
options [`--replicate-do-db=db1`](replication-options-replica.md#option_mysqld_replicate-do-db)
[`--replicate-do-db=channel_1:db2`](replication-options-replica.md#option_mysqld_replicate-do-db)
[`--replicate-do-db=db3`](replication-options-replica.md#option_mysqld_replicate-do-db)
[`--replicate-ignore-db=db4`](replication-options-replica.md#option_mysqld_replicate-ignore-db)
[`--replicate-ignore-db=channel_2:db5`](replication-options-replica.md#option_mysqld_replicate-ignore-db)
[`--replicate-wild-do-table=channel_1:db6.t1%`](replication-options-replica.md#option_mysqld_replicate-wild-do-table)
would result in:

- *Global replication filters*:
  `do_db=db1,db3`;
  `ignore_db=db4`
- *Channel specific filters on
  channel\_1*: `do_db=db2`;
  `ignore_db=db4`;
  `wild-do-table=db6.t1%`
- *Channel specific filters on
  channel\_2*: `do_db=db1,db3`;
  `ignore_db=db5`

These same rules could be applied at startup when included in
the replica's `my.cnf` file, like
this:

```ini
replicate-do-db=db1
replicate-do-db=channel_1:db2
replicate-ignore-db=db4
replicate-ignore-db=channel_2:db5
replicate-wild-do-table=channel_1:db6.t1%
```

To monitor the replication filters in such a setup use the
[`replication_applier_global_filters`](performance-schema-replication-applier-global-filters-table.md "29.12.11.7 The replication_applier_global_filters Table")
and [`replication_applier_filters`](performance-schema-replication-applier-filters-table.md "29.12.11.6 The replication_applier_filters Table")
tables.

##### Configuring Channel Specific Replication Filters at Startup

The replication filter related command options can take an
optional *`channel`* followed by a
colon, followed by the filter specification. The first colon
is interpreted as a separator, subsequent colons are
interpreted as literal colons. The following command options
support channel specific replication filters using this
format:

- `--replicate-do-db=channel:database_id`
- `--replicate-ignore-db=channel:database_id`
- `--replicate-do-table=channel:table_id`
- `--replicate-ignore-table=channel:table_id`
- `--replicate-rewrite-db=channel:db1-db2`
- `--replicate-wild-do-table=channel:table
  pattern`
- `--replicate-wild-ignore-table=channel:table
  pattern`

All of the options just listed can be used in the
replica's `my.cnf` file, as with most
other MySQL server startup options, by omitting the two
leading dashes. See
[Overview of Replication Filters and Channels](replication-rules-channel-based-filters.md#replication-rules-channel-overview "Overview of Replication Filters and Channels"), for a
brief example, as well as [Section 6.2.2.2, “Using Option Files”](option-files.md "6.2.2.2 Using Option Files").

If you use a colon but do not specify a
*`channel`* for the filter option, for
example
`--replicate-do-db=:database_id`,
the option configures the replication filter for the default
replication channel. The default replication channel is the
replication channel which always exists once replication has
been started, and differs from multi-source replication
channels which you create manually. When neither the colon nor
a *`channel`* is specified the option
configures the global replication filters, for example
`--replicate-do-db=database_id`
configures the global
[`--replicate-do-db`](replication-options-replica.md#option_mysqld_replicate-do-db) filter.

If you configure multiple
`rewrite-db=from_name->to_name`
options with the same *`from_name`*
database, all filters are added together (put into the
`rewrite_do` list) and the first one takes
effect.

The *`pattern`* used for the
`--replicate-wild-*-table` options can include
any characters allowed in identifiers as well as the wildcards
`%` and `_`. These work the
same way as when used with the
[`LIKE`](string-comparison-functions.md#operator_like) operator; for example,
`tbl%` matches any table name beginning with
`tbl`, and `tbl_` matches
any table name matching `tbl` plus one
additional character.

##### Changing Channel Specific Replication Filters Online

In addition to the `--replicate-*` options,
replication filters can be configured using the
[`CHANGE REPLICATION FILTER`](change-replication-filter.md "15.4.2.2 CHANGE REPLICATION FILTER Statement")
statement. This removes the need to restart the server, but
the replication SQL thread must be stopped while making the
change. To make this statement apply the filter to a specific
channel, use the `FOR CHANNEL
channel` clause. For
example:

```sql
CHANGE REPLICATION FILTER REPLICATE_DO_DB=(db1) FOR CHANNEL channel_1;
```

When a `FOR CHANNEL` clause is provided, the
statement acts on the specified channel's replication
filters. If multiple types of filters
(`do_db`, `do_ignore_table`,
`wild_do_table`, and so on) are specified,
only the specified filter types are replaced by the statement.
In a replication topology with multiple channels, for example
on a multi-source replica, when no `FOR
CHANNEL` clause is provided, the statement acts on
the global replication filters and all channels’ replication
filters, using a similar logic as the `FOR
CHANNEL` case. For more information see
[Section 15.4.2.2, “CHANGE REPLICATION FILTER Statement”](change-replication-filter.md "15.4.2.2 CHANGE REPLICATION FILTER Statement").

##### Removing Channel Specific Replication Filters

When channel specific replication filters have been
configured, you can remove the filter by issuing an empty
filter type statement. For example to remove all
`REPLICATE_REWRITE_DB` filters from a
replication channel named `channel_1` issue:

```sql
CHANGE REPLICATION FILTER REPLICATE_REWRITE_DB=() FOR CHANNEL channel_1;
```

Any `REPLICATE_REWRITE_DB` filters previously
configured, using either command options or
[`CHANGE REPLICATION FILTER`](change-replication-filter.md "15.4.2.2 CHANGE REPLICATION FILTER Statement"), are
removed.

The [`RESET
REPLICA ALL`](reset-replica.md "15.4.2.4 RESET REPLICA Statement") statement removes channel specific
replication filters that were set on channels deleted by the
statement. When the deleted channel or channels are recreated,
any global replication filters specified for the replica are
copied to them, and no channel specific replication filters
are applied.
