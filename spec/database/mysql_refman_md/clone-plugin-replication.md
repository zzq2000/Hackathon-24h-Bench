#### 7.6.7.7 Cloning for Replication

The clone plugin supports replication. In addition to cloning
data, a cloning operation extracts replication coordinates from
the donor and transfers them to the recipient, which enables
using the clone plugin for provisioning Group Replication
members and replicas. Using the clone plugin for provisioning is
considerably faster and more efficient than replicating a large
number of transactions.

Group Replication members can also be configured to use the
clone plugin as an option for distributed recovery, in which
case joining members automatically choose the most efficient way
to retrieve group data from existing group members. For more
information, see [Section 20.5.4.2, “Cloning for Distributed Recovery”](group-replication-cloning.md "20.5.4.2 Cloning for Distributed Recovery").

During the cloning operation, both the binary log position
(filename, offset) and the
[`gtid_executed`](replication-options-gtids.md#sysvar_gtid_executed) GTID set are
extracted and transferred from the donor MySQL server instance
to the recipient. This data permits initiating replication at a
consistent position in the replication stream. The binary logs
and relay logs, which are held in files, are not copied from the
donor to the recipient. To initiate replication, the binary logs
required for the recipient to catch up to the donor must not be
purged between the time that the data is cloned and the time
that replication is started. If the required binary logs are not
available, a replication handshake error is reported. A cloned
instance should therefore be added to a replication group
without excessive delay to avoid required binary logs being
purged or the new member lagging behind significantly, requiring
more recovery time.

- Issue this query on a cloned MySQL server instance to check
  the binary log position that was transferred to the
  recipient:

  ```sql
  mysql> SELECT BINLOG_FILE, BINLOG_POSITION FROM performance_schema.clone_status;
  ```
- Issue this query on a cloned MySQL server instance to check
  the [`gtid_executed`](replication-options-gtids.md#sysvar_gtid_executed) GTID set
  that was transferred to the recipient:

  ```sql
  mysql> SELECT @@GLOBAL.GTID_EXECUTED;
  ```

By default in MySQL 8.0, the replication metadata repositories
are held in tables that are copied from the donor to the
recipient during the cloning operation. The replication metadata
repositories hold replication-related configuration settings
that can be used to resume replication correctly after the
cloning operation.

- In MySQL 8.0.17 and 8.0.18, only the table
  `mysql.slave_master_info` (the connection
  metadata repository) is copied.
- From MySQL 8.0.19, the tables
  `mysql.slave_relay_log_info` (the applier
  metadata repository) and
  `mysql.slave_worker_info` (the applier
  worker metadata repository) are also copied.

For a list of what is included in each table, see
[Section 19.2.4.2, “Replication Metadata Repositories”](replica-logs-status.md "19.2.4.2 Replication Metadata Repositories"). Note that if the settings
[`master_info_repository=FILE`](replication-options-replica.md#sysvar_master_info_repository) and
[`relay_log_info_repository=FILE`](replication-options-replica.md#sysvar_relay_log_info_repository)
are used on the server (which is not the default in MySQL 8.0
and is deprecated), the replication metadata repositories are
not cloned; they are only cloned if `TABLE` is
set.

To clone for replication, perform the following steps:

1. For a new group member for Group Replication, first
   configure the MySQL Server instance for Group Replication,
   following the instructions in
   [Section 20.2.1.6, “Adding Instances to the Group”](group-replication-adding-instances.md "20.2.1.6 Adding Instances to the Group"). Also
   set up the prerequisites for cloning described in
   [Section 20.5.4.2, “Cloning for Distributed Recovery”](group-replication-cloning.md "20.5.4.2 Cloning for Distributed Recovery"). When you issue
   [`START GROUP_REPLICATION`](start-group-replication.md "15.4.3.1 START GROUP_REPLICATION Statement") on
   the joining member, the cloning operation is managed
   automatically by Group Replication, so you do not need to
   carry out the operation manually, and you do not need to
   perform any further setup steps on the joining member.
2. For a replica in a source/replica MySQL replication
   topology, first clone the data from the donor MySQL server
   instance to the recipient manually. The donor must be a
   source or replica in the replication topology. For cloning
   instructions, see [Section 7.6.7.3, “Cloning Remote Data”](clone-plugin-remote.md "7.6.7.3 Cloning Remote Data").
3. After the cloning operation completes successfully, if you
   want to use the same replication channels on the recipient
   MySQL server instance that were present on the donor, verify
   which of them can resume replication automatically in the
   source/replica MySQL replication topology, and which need to
   be set up manually.

   - For GTID-based replication, if the recipient is
     configured with
     [`gtid_mode=ON`](replication-options-gtids.md#sysvar_gtid_mode) and has
     cloned from a donor with
     [`gtid_mode=ON`](replication-options-gtids.md#sysvar_gtid_mode),
     `ON_PERMISSIVE`, or
     `OFF_PERMISSIVE`, the
     [`gtid_executed`](replication-options-gtids.md#sysvar_gtid_executed) GTID set
     from the donor is applied on the recipient. If the
     recipient is cloned from a replica already in the
     topology, replication channels on the recipient that use
     GTID auto-positioning can resume replication
     automatically after the cloning operation when the
     channel is started. You do not need to perform any
     manual setup if you just want to use these same
     channels.
   - For binary log file position based replication, if the
     recipient is at MySQL 8.0.17 or 8.0.18, the binary log
     position from the donor is not applied on the recipient,
     only recorded in the Performance Schema
     [`clone_status`](performance-schema-clone-status-table.md "29.12.19.1 The clone_status Table") table.
     Replication channels on the recipient that use binary
     log file position based replication must therefore be
     set up manually to resume replication after the cloning
     operation. Ensure that these channels are not configured
     to start replication automatically at server startup, as
     they do not yet have the binary log position and attempt
     to start replication from the beginning.
   - For binary log file position based replication, if the
     recipient is at MySQL 8.0.19 or above, the binary log
     position from the donor is applied on the recipient.
     Replication channels on the recipient that use binary
     log file position based replication automatically
     attempt to carry out the relay log recovery process,
     using the cloned relay log information, before
     restarting replication. For a single-threaded replica
     ([`replica_parallel_workers`](replication-options-replica.md#sysvar_replica_parallel_workers)
     or
     [`slave_parallel_workers`](replication-options-replica.md#sysvar_slave_parallel_workers)
     is set to 0), relay log recovery should succeed in the
     absence of any other issues, enabling the channel to
     resume replication with no further setup. For a
     multithreaded replica
     ([`replica_parallel_workers`](replication-options-replica.md#sysvar_replica_parallel_workers)
     or
     [`slave_parallel_workers`](replication-options-replica.md#sysvar_slave_parallel_workers)
     is greater than 0), relay log recovery is likely to fail
     because it cannot usually be completed automatically. In
     this case, an error message is issued, and you must set
     the channel up manually.
4. If you need to set up cloned replication channels manually,
   or want to use different replication channels on the
   recipient, the following instructions provide a summary and
   abbreviated examples for adding a recipient MySQL server
   instance to a replication topology. Also refer to the
   detailed instructions that apply to your replication setup.

   - To add a recipient MySQL server instance to a MySQL
     replication topology that uses GTID-based transactions
     as the replication data source, configure the instance
     as required, following the instructions in
     [Section 19.1.3.4, “Setting Up Replication Using GTIDs”](replication-gtids-howto.md "19.1.3.4 Setting Up Replication Using GTIDs"). Add
     replication channels for the instance as shown in the
     following abbreviated example. The
     [`CHANGE REPLICATION SOURCE
     TO`](change-replication-source-to.md "15.4.2.3 CHANGE REPLICATION SOURCE TO Statement") statement (from MySQL 8.0.23) or
     [`CHANGE MASTER TO`](change-master-to.md "15.4.2.1 CHANGE MASTER TO Statement")
     statement (before MySQL 8.0.23) must define the host
     address and port number of the source, and the
     `SOURCE_AUTO_POSITION` |
     `MASTER_AUTO_POSITION` option should be
     enabled, as shown:

     ```sql
     mysql> CHANGE MASTER TO MASTER_HOST = 'source_host_name', MASTER_PORT = source_port_num,
            ...
            MASTER_AUTO_POSITION = 1,
            FOR CHANNEL 'setup_channel';
     mysql> START SLAVE USER = 'user_name' PASSWORD = 'password' FOR CHANNEL 'setup_channel';

     Or from MySQL 8.0.22 and 8.0.23:

     mysql> CHANGE SOURCE TO SOURCE_HOST = 'source_host_name', SOURCE_PORT = source_port_num,
            ...
            SOURCE_AUTO_POSITION = 1,
            FOR CHANNEL 'setup_channel';
     mysql> START REPLICA USER = 'user_name' PASSWORD = 'password' FOR CHANNEL 'setup_channel';
     ```
   - To add a recipient MySQL server instance to a MySQL
     replication topology that uses binary log file position
     based replication, configure the instance as required,
     following the instructions in
     [Section 19.1.2, “Setting Up Binary Log File Position Based Replication”](replication-howto.md "19.1.2 Setting Up Binary Log File Position Based Replication"). Add replication
     channels for the instance as shown in the following
     abbreviated example, using the binary log position that
     was transferred to the recipient during the cloning
     operation:

     ```sql
     mysql> SELECT BINLOG_FILE, BINLOG_POSITION FROM performance_schema.clone_status;
     mysql> CHANGE MASTER TO MASTER_HOST = 'source_host_name', MASTER_PORT = source_port_num,
            ...
            MASTER_LOG_FILE = 'source_log_name',
            MASTER_LOG_POS = source_log_pos,
            FOR CHANNEL 'setup_channel';
     mysql> START SLAVE USER = 'user_name' PASSWORD = 'password' FOR CHANNEL 'setup_channel';

     Or from MySQL 8.0.22 and 8.0.23:

     mysql> SELECT BINLOG_FILE, BINLOG_POSITION FROM performance_schema.clone_status;
     mysql> CHANGE SOURCE TO SOURCE_HOST = 'source_host_name', SOURCE_PORT = source_port_num,
            ...
            SOURCE_LOG_FILE = 'source_log_name',
            SOURCE_LOG_POS = source_log_pos,
            FOR CHANNEL 'setup_channel';
     mysql> START REPLICA USER = 'user_name' PASSWORD = 'password' FOR CHANNEL 'setup_channel';
     ```
