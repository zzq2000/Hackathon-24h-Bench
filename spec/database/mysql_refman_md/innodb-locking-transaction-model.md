To implement a large-scale, busy, or highly reliable database
application, to port substantial code from a different database
system, or to tune MySQL performance, it is important to understand
`InnoDB` locking and the `InnoDB`
transaction model.

This section discusses several topics related to
`InnoDB` locking and the `InnoDB`
transaction model with which you should be familiar.

- [Section 17.7.1, “InnoDB Locking”](innodb-locking.md "17.7.1 InnoDB Locking") describes lock types used by
  `InnoDB`.
- [Section 17.7.2, “InnoDB Transaction Model”](innodb-transaction-model.md "17.7.2 InnoDB Transaction Model") describes transaction
  isolation levels and the locking strategies used by each. It
  also discusses the use of
  [`autocommit`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_autocommit), consistent
  non-locking reads, and locking reads.
- [Section 17.7.3, “Locks Set by Different SQL Statements in InnoDB”](innodb-locks-set.md "17.7.3 Locks Set by Different SQL Statements in InnoDB") discusses specific types of
  locks set in `InnoDB` for various statements.
- [Section 17.7.4, “Phantom Rows”](innodb-next-key-locking.md "17.7.4 Phantom Rows") describes how
  `InnoDB` uses next-key locking to avoid phantom
  rows.
- [Section 17.7.5, “Deadlocks in InnoDB”](innodb-deadlocks.md "17.7.5 Deadlocks in InnoDB") provides a deadlock example,
  discusses deadlock detection, and provides tips for minimizing
  and handling deadlocks in `InnoDB`.
