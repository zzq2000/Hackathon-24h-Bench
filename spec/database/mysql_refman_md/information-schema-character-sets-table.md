columns:

- `CHARACTER_SET_NAME`

  The character set name.

#### Notes

Character set information is also available from the

[Section 15.7.7.3, “SHOW CHARACTER SET Statement”](show-character-set.md "15.7.7.3 SHOW CHARACTER SET Statement"). The following statements are
equivalent:

```sql
SELECT * FROM INFORMATION_SCHEMA.CHARACTER_SETS
  [WHERE CHARACTER_SET_NAME LIKE 'wild']

SHOW CHARACTER SET
  [LIKE 'wild']
```
