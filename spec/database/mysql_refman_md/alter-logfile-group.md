### 15.1.6 ALTER LOGFILE GROUP Statement

```sql
ALTER LOGFILE GROUP logfile_group
    ADD UNDOFILE 'file_name'
    [INITIAL_SIZE [=] size]
    [WAIT]
    ENGINE [=] engine_name
```

This statement adds an `UNDO` file named
'*`file_name`*' to an existing log file
group *`logfile_group`*. An
[`ALTER LOGFILE GROUP`](alter-logfile-group.md "15.1.6 ALTER LOGFILE GROUP Statement") statement has
one and only one `ADD UNDOFILE` clause. No
`DROP UNDOFILE` clause is currently supported.

Note

All NDB Cluster Disk Data objects share the same namespace. This
means that *each Disk Data object* must be
uniquely named (and not merely each Disk Data object of a given
type). For example, you cannot have a tablespace and an undo log
file with the same name, or an undo log file and a data file
with the same name.

The optional `INITIAL_SIZE` parameter sets the
`UNDO` file's initial size in bytes; if not
specified, the initial size defaults to 134217728 (128 MB). You
may optionally follow *`size`* with a
one-letter abbreviation for an order of magnitude, similar to
those used in `my.cnf`. Generally, this is one
of the letters `M` (megabytes) or
`G` (gigabytes). (Bug #13116514, Bug #16104705,
Bug #62858)

On 32-bit systems, the maximum supported value for
`INITIAL_SIZE` is 4294967296 (4 GB). (Bug #29186)

The minimum allowed value for `INITIAL_SIZE` is
1048576 (1 MB). (Bug #29574)

Note

`WAIT` is parsed but otherwise ignored. This
keyword currently has no effect, and is intended for future
expansion.

The `ENGINE` parameter (required) determines the
storage engine which is used by this log file group, with
*`engine_name`* being the name of the
storage engine. Currently, the only accepted values for
*`engine_name`* are
“[`NDBCLUSTER`](mysql-cluster.md "Chapter 25 MySQL NDB Cluster 8.0")” and
“[`NDB`](mysql-cluster.md "Chapter 25 MySQL NDB Cluster 8.0")”. The two values
are equivalent.

Here is an example, which assumes that the log file group
`lg_3` has already been created using
[`CREATE LOGFILE GROUP`](create-logfile-group.md "15.1.16 CREATE LOGFILE GROUP Statement") (see
[Section 15.1.16, “CREATE LOGFILE GROUP Statement”](create-logfile-group.md "15.1.16 CREATE LOGFILE GROUP Statement")):

```sql
ALTER LOGFILE GROUP lg_3
    ADD UNDOFILE 'undo_10.dat'
    INITIAL_SIZE=32M
    ENGINE=NDBCLUSTER;
```

When [`ALTER LOGFILE GROUP`](alter-logfile-group.md "15.1.6 ALTER LOGFILE GROUP Statement") is used
with `ENGINE = NDBCLUSTER` (alternatively,
`ENGINE = NDB`), an `UNDO` log
file is created on each NDB Cluster data node. You can verify that
the `UNDO` files were created and obtain
information about them by querying the Information Schema
[`FILES`](information-schema-files-table.md "28.3.15 The INFORMATION_SCHEMA FILES Table") table. For example:

```sql
mysql> SELECT FILE_NAME, LOGFILE_GROUP_NUMBER, EXTRA
    -> FROM INFORMATION_SCHEMA.FILES
    -> WHERE LOGFILE_GROUP_NAME = 'lg_3';
+-------------+----------------------+----------------+
| FILE_NAME   | LOGFILE_GROUP_NUMBER | EXTRA          |
+-------------+----------------------+----------------+
| newdata.dat |                    0 | CLUSTER_NODE=3 |
| newdata.dat |                    0 | CLUSTER_NODE=4 |
| undo_10.dat |                   11 | CLUSTER_NODE=3 |
| undo_10.dat |                   11 | CLUSTER_NODE=4 |
+-------------+----------------------+----------------+
4 rows in set (0.01 sec)
```

(See [Section 28.3.15, “The INFORMATION\_SCHEMA FILES Table”](information-schema-files-table.md "28.3.15 The INFORMATION_SCHEMA FILES Table").)

Memory used for `UNDO_BUFFER_SIZE` comes from the
global pool whose size is determined by the value of the
[`SharedGlobalMemory`](mysql-cluster-ndbd-definition.md#ndbparam-ndbd-sharedglobalmemory) data
node configuration parameter. This includes any default value
implied for this option by the setting of the
[`InitialLogFileGroup`](mysql-cluster-ndbd-definition.md#ndbparam-ndbd-initiallogfilegroup) data
node configuration parameter.

[`ALTER LOGFILE GROUP`](alter-logfile-group.md "15.1.6 ALTER LOGFILE GROUP Statement") is useful only
with Disk Data storage for NDB Cluster. For more information, see
[Section 25.6.11, “NDB Cluster Disk Data Tables”](mysql-cluster-disk-data.md "25.6.11 NDB Cluster Disk Data Tables").
