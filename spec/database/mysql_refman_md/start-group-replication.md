#### 15.4.3.1 START GROUP\_REPLICATION Statement

```sql
  START GROUP_REPLICATION
          [USER='user_name']
          [, PASSWORD='user_pass']
          [, DEFAULT_AUTH='plugin_name']
```

Starts group replication. This statement requires the
[`GROUP_REPLICATION_ADMIN`](privileges-provided.md#priv_group-replication-admin) privilege
(or the deprecated [`SUPER`](privileges-provided.md#priv_super)
privilege). If
[`super_read_only=ON`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_super_read_only) is set and
the member should join as a primary,
[`super_read_only`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_super_read_only) is set to
`OFF` once Group Replication successfully
starts.

A server that participates in a group in single-primary mode
should use
[`skip_replica_start=ON`](replication-options-replica.md#sysvar_skip_replica_start).
Otherwise, the server is not allowed to join a group as a
secondary.

In MySQL 8.0.21 and later, you can specify user credentials for
distributed recovery on the `START
GROUP_REPLICATION` statement using the
`USER`, `PASSWORD`, and
`DEFAULT_AUTH` options, as follows:

- `USER`: The replication user for
  distributed recovery. For instructions to set up this
  account, see
  [Section 20.2.1.3, “User Credentials For Distributed Recovery”](group-replication-user-credentials.md "20.2.1.3 User Credentials For Distributed Recovery"). You
  cannot specify an empty or null string, or omit the
  `USER` option if
  `PASSWORD` is specified.
- `PASSWORD`: The password for the
  replication user account. The password cannot be encrypted,
  but it is masked in the query log.
- `DEFAULT_AUTH`: The name of the
  authentication plugin used for the replication user account.
  If you do not specify this option, MySQL native
  authentication (the `mysql_native_password`
  plugin) is assumed. This option acts as a hint to the
  server, and the donor for distributed recovery overrides it
  if a different plugin is associated with the user account on
  that server. The authentication plugin used by default when
  you create user accounts in MySQL 8 is the caching SHA-2
  authentication plugin
  (`caching_sha2_password`). See
  [Section 8.2.17, “Pluggable Authentication”](pluggable-authentication.md "8.2.17 Pluggable Authentication") for more
  information on authentication plugins.

These credentials are used for distributed recovery on the
`group_replication_recovery` channel. When you
specify user credentials on `START
GROUP_REPLICATION`, the credentials are saved in memory
only, and are removed by a `STOP
GROUP_REPLICATION` statement or server shutdown. You
must issue a `START GROUP_REPLICATION`
statement to provide the credentials again. This method is
therefore not compatible with starting Group Replication
automatically on server start, as specified by the
[`group_replication_start_on_boot`](group-replication-system-variables.md#sysvar_group_replication_start_on_boot)
system variable.

User credentials specified on `START
GROUP_REPLICATION` take precedence over any user
credentials set for the
`group_replication_recovery` channel using a
[`CHANGE REPLICATION SOURCE TO`](change-replication-source-to.md "15.4.2.3 CHANGE REPLICATION SOURCE TO Statement")
statement (from MySQL 8.0.23) or [`CHANGE
MASTER TO`](change-master-to.md "15.4.2.1 CHANGE MASTER TO Statement") statement (before MySQL 8.0.23). Note that
user credentials set using these statements are stored in the
replication metadata repositories, and are used when
`START GROUP_REPLICATION` is specified without
user credentials, including automatic starts if the
[`group_replication_start_on_boot`](group-replication-system-variables.md#sysvar_group_replication_start_on_boot)
system variable is set to `ON`. To gain the
security benefits of specifying user credentials on
`START GROUP_REPLICATION`, ensure that
[`group_replication_start_on_boot`](group-replication-system-variables.md#sysvar_group_replication_start_on_boot)
is set to `OFF` (the default is
`ON`), and clear any user credentials
previously set for the
`group_replication_recovery` channel, following
the instructions in
[Section 20.6.3, “Securing Distributed Recovery Connections”](group-replication-distributed-recovery-securing.md "20.6.3 Securing Distributed Recovery Connections").

While a member is rejoining a replication group, its status can
be displayed as `OFFLINE` or
`ERROR` before the group completes the
compatibility checks and accepts it as a member. When the member
is catching up with the group's transactions, its status is
`RECOVERING`.
