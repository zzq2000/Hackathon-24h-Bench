## 29.16 Performance Schema Status Variables

The Performance Schema implements several status variables that
provide information about instrumentation that could not be loaded
or created due to memory constraints:

```sql
mysql> SHOW STATUS LIKE 'perf%';

For information on using these variables to check Performance
Schema status, see
[Section 29.7, “Performance Schema Status Monitoring”](performance-schema-status-monitoring.md "29.7 Performance Schema Status Monitoring").

Performance Schema status variables have the following meanings:

- [`Performance_schema_accounts_lost`](performance-schema-status-variables.md#statvar_Performance_schema_accounts_lost)

  The number of times a row could not be added to the
  [`accounts`](performance-schema-accounts-table.md "29.12.8.1 The accounts Table") table because it was
  full.
- [`Performance_schema_cond_classes_lost`](performance-schema-status-variables.md#statvar_Performance_schema_cond_classes_lost)

  How many condition instruments could not be loaded.
- [`Performance_schema_cond_instances_lost`](performance-schema-status-variables.md#statvar_Performance_schema_cond_instances_lost)

  How many condition instrument instances could not be created.
- [`Performance_schema_digest_lost`](performance-schema-status-variables.md#statvar_Performance_schema_digest_lost)

  The number of digest instances that could not be instrumented
  in the
  [`events_statements_summary_by_digest`](performance-schema-statement-summary-tables.md "29.12.20.3 Statement Summary Tables")
  table. This can be nonzero if the value of
  [`performance_schema_digests_size`](performance-schema-system-variables.md#sysvar_performance_schema_digests_size)
  is too small.
- [`Performance_schema_file_classes_lost`](performance-schema-status-variables.md#statvar_Performance_schema_file_classes_lost)

  How many file instruments could not be loaded.
- [`Performance_schema_file_handles_lost`](performance-schema-status-variables.md#statvar_Performance_schema_file_handles_lost)

  How many file instrument instances could not be opened.
- [`Performance_schema_file_instances_lost`](performance-schema-status-variables.md#statvar_Performance_schema_file_instances_lost)

  How many file instrument instances could not be created.
- [`Performance_schema_hosts_lost`](performance-schema-status-variables.md#statvar_Performance_schema_hosts_lost)

  The number of times a row could not be added to the
  [`hosts`](performance-schema-hosts-table.md "29.12.8.2 The hosts Table") table because it was full.
- [`Performance_schema_index_stat_lost`](performance-schema-status-variables.md#statvar_Performance_schema_index_stat_lost)

  The number of indexes for which statistics were lost. This can
  be nonzero if the value of
  [`performance_schema_max_index_stat`](performance-schema-system-variables.md#sysvar_performance_schema_max_index_stat)
  is too small.
- [`Performance_schema_locker_lost`](performance-schema-status-variables.md#statvar_Performance_schema_locker_lost)

  How many events are “lost” or not recorded, due
  to the following conditions:

  - Events are recursive (for example, waiting for A caused a
    wait on B, which caused a wait on C).
  - The depth of the nested events stack is greater than the
    limit imposed by the implementation.

  Events recorded by the Performance Schema are not recursive,
  so this variable should always be 0.
- [`Performance_schema_memory_classes_lost`](performance-schema-status-variables.md#statvar_Performance_schema_memory_classes_lost)

  The number of times a memory instrument could not be loaded.
- [`Performance_schema_metadata_lock_lost`](performance-schema-status-variables.md#statvar_Performance_schema_metadata_lock_lost)

  The number of metadata locks that could not be instrumented in
  the [`metadata_locks`](performance-schema-metadata-locks-table.md "29.12.13.3 The metadata_locks Table") table. This
  can be nonzero if the value of
  [`performance_schema_max_metadata_locks`](performance-schema-system-variables.md#sysvar_performance_schema_max_metadata_locks)
  is too small.
- [`Performance_schema_mutex_classes_lost`](performance-schema-status-variables.md#statvar_Performance_schema_mutex_classes_lost)

  How many mutex instruments could not be loaded.
- [`Performance_schema_mutex_instances_lost`](performance-schema-status-variables.md#statvar_Performance_schema_mutex_instances_lost)

  How many mutex instrument instances could not be created.
- [`Performance_schema_nested_statement_lost`](performance-schema-status-variables.md#statvar_Performance_schema_nested_statement_lost)

  The number of stored program statements for which statistics
  were lost. This can be nonzero if the value of
  [`performance_schema_max_statement_stack`](performance-schema-system-variables.md#sysvar_performance_schema_max_statement_stack)
  is too small.
- [`Performance_schema_prepared_statements_lost`](performance-schema-status-variables.md#statvar_Performance_schema_prepared_statements_lost)

  The number of prepared statements that could not be
  instrumented in the
  [`prepared_statements_instances`](performance-schema-prepared-statements-instances-table.md "29.12.6.4 The prepared_statements_instances Table")
  table. This can be nonzero if the value of
  [`performance_schema_max_prepared_statements_instances`](performance-schema-system-variables.md#sysvar_performance_schema_max_prepared_statements_instances)
  is too small.
- [`Performance_schema_program_lost`](performance-schema-status-variables.md#statvar_Performance_schema_program_lost)

  The number of stored programs for which statistics were lost.
  This can be nonzero if the value of
  [`performance_schema_max_program_instances`](performance-schema-system-variables.md#sysvar_performance_schema_max_program_instances)
  is too small.
- [`Performance_schema_rwlock_classes_lost`](performance-schema-status-variables.md#statvar_Performance_schema_rwlock_classes_lost)

  How many rwlock instruments could not be loaded.
- [`Performance_schema_rwlock_instances_lost`](performance-schema-status-variables.md#statvar_Performance_schema_rwlock_instances_lost)

  How many rwlock instrument instances could not be created.
- [`Performance_schema_session_connect_attrs_longest_seen`](performance-schema-status-variables.md#statvar_Performance_schema_session_connect_attrs_longest_seen)

  In addition to the connection attribute size-limit check
  performed by the Performance Schema against the value of the
  [`performance_schema_session_connect_attrs_size`](performance-schema-system-variables.md#sysvar_performance_schema_session_connect_attrs_size)
  system variable, the server performs a preliminary check,
  imposing a limit of 64KB on the aggregate size of connection
  attribute data it accepts. If a client attempts to send more
  than 64KB of attribute data, the server rejects the
  connection. Otherwise, the server considers the attribute
  buffer valid and tracks the size of the longest such buffer in
  the
  [`Performance_schema_session_connect_attrs_longest_seen`](performance-schema-status-variables.md#statvar_Performance_schema_session_connect_attrs_longest_seen)
  status variable. If this value is larger than
  [`performance_schema_session_connect_attrs_size`](performance-schema-system-variables.md#sysvar_performance_schema_session_connect_attrs_size),
  DBAs may wish to increase the latter value, or, alternatively,
  investigate which clients are sending large amounts of
  attribute data.

  For more information about connection attributes, see
  [Section 29.12.9, “Performance Schema Connection Attribute Tables”](performance-schema-connection-attribute-tables.md "29.12.9 Performance Schema Connection Attribute Tables").
- [`Performance_schema_session_connect_attrs_lost`](performance-schema-status-variables.md#statvar_Performance_schema_session_connect_attrs_lost)

  The number of connections for which connection attribute
  truncation has occurred. For a given connection, if the client
  sends connection attribute key-value pairs for which the
  aggregate size is larger than the reserved storage permitted
  by the value of the
  [`performance_schema_session_connect_attrs_size`](performance-schema-system-variables.md#sysvar_performance_schema_session_connect_attrs_size)
  system variable, the Performance Schema truncates the
  attribute data and increments
  [`Performance_schema_session_connect_attrs_lost`](performance-schema-status-variables.md#statvar_Performance_schema_session_connect_attrs_lost).
  If this value is nonzero, you may wish to set
  [`performance_schema_session_connect_attrs_size`](performance-schema-system-variables.md#sysvar_performance_schema_session_connect_attrs_size)
  to a larger value.

  For more information about connection attributes, see
  [Section 29.12.9, “Performance Schema Connection Attribute Tables”](performance-schema-connection-attribute-tables.md "29.12.9 Performance Schema Connection Attribute Tables").
