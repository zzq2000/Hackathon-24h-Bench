#### 7.4.4.1 Binary Logging Formats

The server uses several logging formats to record information in
the binary log:

- Replication capabilities in MySQL originally were based on
  propagation of SQL statements from source to replica. This
  is called *statement-based logging*. You
  can cause this format to be used by starting the server with
  [`--binlog-format=STATEMENT`](replication-options-binary-log.md#sysvar_binlog_format).
- In *row-based logging* (the default), the
  source writes events to the binary log that indicate how
  individual table rows are affected. You can cause the server
  to use row-based logging by starting it with
  [`--binlog-format=ROW`](replication-options-binary-log.md#sysvar_binlog_format).
- A third option is also available: *mixed
  logging*. With mixed logging, statement-based
  logging is used by default, but the logging mode switches
  automatically to row-based in certain cases as described
  below. You can cause MySQL to use mixed logging explicitly
  by starting [**mysqld**](mysqld.md "6.3.1 mysqld — The MySQL Server") with the option
  [`--binlog-format=MIXED`](replication-options-binary-log.md#sysvar_binlog_format).

The logging format can also be set or limited by the storage
engine being used. This helps to eliminate issues when
replicating certain statements between a source and replica
which are using different storage engines.

With statement-based replication, there may be issues with
replicating nondeterministic statements. In deciding whether or
not a given statement is safe for statement-based replication,
MySQL determines whether it can guarantee that the statement can
be replicated using statement-based logging. If MySQL cannot
make this guarantee, it marks the statement as potentially
unreliable and issues the warning, Statement may not
be safe to log in statement format.

You can avoid these issues by using MySQL's row-based
replication instead.
