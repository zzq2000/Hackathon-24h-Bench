#### 20.5.3.2 Configuring Transaction Consistency Guarantees

Although the
[Transaction Synchronization Points](group-replication-understanding-consistency-guarantees.md#group-replication-synchronization-points "Transaction Synchronization Points")
section explains that conceptually there are two synchronization
points from which you can choose: on read or on write, these
terms were a simplification and the terms used in Group
Replication are: *before* and
*after* transaction execution. The
consistency level can have different affects on read-only and
read/write transactions processed by the group as demonstrated
in this section.

- [Permitted Queries Under Consistency Rules](group-replication-configuring-consistency-guarantees.md#group-replication-nonblocking "Permitted Queries Under Consistency Rules")

The following list shows the possible consistency levels that
you can configure in Group Replication using the
[`group_replication_consistency`](group-replication-system-variables.md#sysvar_group_replication_consistency)
variable, in order of increasing transaction consistency
guarantee:

- `EVENTUAL`

  Neither read-only nor read/write transactions wait for
  preceding transactions to be applied before executing. This
  was the behavior of Group Replication before the
  [`group_replication_consistency`](group-replication-system-variables.md#sysvar_group_replication_consistency)
  variable was added. A read/write transaction does not wait
  for other members to apply a transaction. This means that a
  transaction could be externalized on one member before the
  others. This also means that in the event of a primary
  failover, the new primary can accept new read-only and
  read/write transactions before the previous primary
  transactions are all applied. Read-only transactions could
  result in outdated values, read/write transactions could
  result in a rollback due to conflicts.
- `BEFORE_ON_PRIMARY_FAILOVER`

  New read-only or read/write transactions with a newly
  elected primary that is applying a backlog from the old
  primary are not applied until any backlog has been applied.
  This ensures that when a primary failover happens,
  intentionally or not, clients always see the latest value on
  the primary. This guarantees consistency, but means that
  clients must be able to handle the delay in the event that a
  backlog is being applied. Usually this delay should be
  minimal, but it does depend on the size of the backlog.
- `BEFORE`

  A read/write transaction waits for all preceding
  transactions to complete before being applied. A read-only
  transaction waits for all preceding transactions to complete
  before being executed. This ensures that this transaction
  reads the latest value by only affecting the latency of the
  transaction. This reduces the overhead of synchronization on
  every read/write transaction, by ensuring synchronization is
  used only on read-only transactions. This consistency level
  also includes the consistency guarantees provided by
  `BEFORE_ON_PRIMARY_FAILOVER`.
- `AFTER`

  A read/write transaction waits until its changes have been
  applied to all of the other members. This value has no
  effect on read-only transactions. This mode ensures that
  when a transaction is committed on the local member, any
  subsequent transaction reads the written value or a more
  recent value on any group member. Use this mode with a group
  that is used for predominantly read-only operations to
  ensure that applied read/write transactions are applied
  everywhere once they commit. This could be used by your
  application to ensure that subsequent reads fetch the latest
  data which includes the latest writes. This reduces the
  overhead of synchronization on every read-only transaction,
  by ensuring synchronization is used only on read/write
  transactions. This consistency level also includes the
  consistency guarantees provided by
  `BEFORE_ON_PRIMARY_FAILOVER`.
- `BEFORE_AND_AFTER`

  A read/write transaction waits for 1) all preceding
  transactions to complete before being applied and 2) until
  its changes have been applied on other members. A read-only
  transaction waits for all preceding transactions to complete
  before execution takes place. This consistency level also
  includes the consistency guarantees provided by
  `BEFORE_ON_PRIMARY_FAILOVER`.

The `BEFORE` and
`BEFORE_AND_AFTER` consistency levels can be
used on both read-only and read/write transactions. The
`AFTER` consistency level has no impact on
read-only transactions, because they do not generate changes.

##### How to Choose a Consistency Level

The different consistency levels provide flexibility to both
DBAs, who can use them to set up their infrastructure; and to
developers who can use the consistency level that best suits
their application's requirements. The following scenarios show
how to choose a consistency guarantee level based on how you
use your group:

- *Scenario 1*: You want to balance reads
  without being concerned about stale reads, and group write
  operations are considerably fewer than group read
  operations. In this case, you should choose
  `AFTER`.
- *Scenario 2*: For a data set that
  applies many writes, you want to perform occasional reads
  without concerns about reading stale data. In this case,
  you should choose `BEFORE`.
- *Scenario 3*: You want specific
  transactions to read only up-to-date data from the group,
  so that whenever sensitive data such as credentials for a
  file is updated, reads always use the most recent value.
  In this case, you should choose `BEFORE`.
- *Scenario 4*: For a group that has
  predominantly read-only data, you want read/write
  transactions to be applied everywhere once they commit, so
  that subsequent reads are done on data that includes your
  latest writes and you do not incur the cost of
  synchronization for every read-only transaction, but only
  for read/write transactions. In this case, you should
  choose `AFTER`.
- *Scenario 5*: For a group that works
  predominantly with read-only data, you want read/write
  transactions to read up-to-date data from the group and to
  be applied everywhere once they commit, so that subsequent
  reads are performed on data that includes the latest write
  and you do not incur the cost of synchronization for every
  read-only transaction, but only for read/write
  transactions. In this case, you should choose
  `BEFORE_AND_AFTER`.

You can choose the scope for which the consistency level is
enforced by setting
[`group_replication_consistency`](group-replication-system-variables.md#sysvar_group_replication_consistency)
with session or global scope. This is important because
consistency levels can have a negative impact on group
performance they apply globally.

To enforce the consistency level for the current session, use
session scope, like this:

```sql
> SET @@SESSION.group_replication_consistency= 'BEFORE';
```

To enforce the consistency level for all sessions, use global
scope, as shown here:

```sql
> SET @@GLOBAL.group_replication_consistency= 'BEFORE';
```

The possibility of setting the consistency level on specific
sessions enables you to take advantage of scenarios such as
those listed here:

- *Scenario 6*: A given system handles
  several instructions that do not require a strong
  consistency level, but one kind of instruction does
  require strong consistency: managing access permissions to
  documents;. In this scenario, the system changes access
  permissions and it wants to be sure that all clients see
  the correct permission. You only need to `SET
  @@SESSION.group_replication_consistency=
  ‘AFTER’`, on those instructions and leave the
  other instructions to run with `EVENTUAL`
  set at the global scope.
- *Scenario 7*: On the same system as
  described in Scenario 6, a command that performs analytics
  needs to be executed daily, using the most up-to-date
  data. To achieve this, you need only run the SQL statement
  `SET @@SESSION.group_replication_consistency=
  ‘BEFORE’` prior to executing the command.

In sum, you do not need to run all transactions with the same
specific consistency level, especially if only some
transactions actually require it.

You should be aware that all read/write transactions are
always ordered in Group Replication, so even when you set the
consistency level to `AFTER` for the current
session, this transaction waits until its changes are applied
on all members, which means waiting for this and all preceding
transactions that could be in the secondaries' queues. In
other words, the consistency level `AFTER`
waits for everything up to and including this transaction.

##### Impacts of Consistency Levels

Another way to classify the consistency levels is in terms of
impact on the group, that is, the repercussions that the
consistency levels have on the other members.

The `BEFORE` consistency level, apart from
being ordered on the transaction stream, only impacts on the
local member. That is, it does not require coordination with
the other members and does not have repercussions on their
transactions. In other words, `BEFORE` only
impacts the transactions on which it is used.

The `AFTER` and
`BEFORE_AND_AFTER` consistency levels do have
side-effects on concurrent transactions executed on other
members. These consistency levels make the other members
transactions wait if transactions with the
`EVENTUAL` consistency level start while a
transaction with `AFTER` or
`BEFORE_AND_AFTER` is executing. The other
members wait until the `AFTER` transaction is
committed on that member, even if the other member's
transactions have the `EVENTUAL` consistency
level. In other words, `AFTER` and
`BEFORE_AND_AFTER` impact
*all* `ONLINE` group
members.

To illustrate this further, imagine a group with 3 members,
M1, M2 and M3. On member M1 a client issues:

```sql
> SET @@SESSION.group_replication_consistency= AFTER;
> BEGIN;
> INSERT INTO t1 VALUES (1);
> COMMIT;
```

Then, while the above transaction is being applied, on member
M2 a client issues:

```sql
> SET SESSION group_replication_consistency= EVENTUAL;
```

In this situation, even though the second transaction's
consistency level is `EVENTUAL`, because it
starts executing while the first transaction is already in the
commit phase on M2, the second transaction has to wait for the
first transaction to finish the commit and only then can it
execute.

You can only use the consistency levels
`BEFORE`, `AFTER` and
`BEFORE_AND_AFTER` on
`ONLINE` members, attempting to use them on
members in other states causes a session error.

Transactions whose consistency level is not
`EVENTUAL` hold execution until a timeout,
configured by [`wait_timeout`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_wait_timeout)
value is reached, which defaults to 8 hours. If the timeout is
reached an
[`ER_GR_HOLD_WAIT_TIMEOUT`](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/mysql-errors/8.0/en/server-error-reference.html#error_er_gr_hold_wait_timeout) error
is thrown.

##### Impact of Consistency on Primary Election

This section describes how a group's consistency level impacts
on a single-primary group that has elected a new primary. Such
a group automatically detects failures and adjusts the view of
the members that are active, in other words the membership
configuration. Furthermore, if a group is deployed in
single-primary mode, whenever the group's membership changes
there is a check performed to detect if there is still a
primary member in the group. If there is none, a new one is
selected from the list of secondary members. Typically, this
is known as the secondary promotion.

Given the fact that the system detects failures and
reconfigures itself automatically, the user may also expect
that once the promotion takes place, the new primary is in the
exact state, data-wise, as that of the old one. In other
words, the user may expect that there is no backlog of
replicated transactions to be applied on the new primary once
he is able to read from and write to it. In practical terms,
the user may expect that once his application fails-over to
the new primary, there would be no chance, even if
temporarily, to read old data or write into old data records.

When flow control is activated and properly tuned on a group,
there is only a small chance of transiently reading stale data
from a newly elected primary immediately after the promotion,
as there should not be a backlog, or if there is one it should
be small. Moreover, you might have a proxy or middleware
layers that govern application accesses to the primary after a
promotion and enforce the consistency criteria at that level.
If all group members are using MySQL 8.0.14 or later, you can
specify the behavior of the new primary once it is promoted
using the
[`group_replication_consistency`](group-replication-system-variables.md#sysvar_group_replication_consistency)
variable, which controls whether a newly elected primary
blocks both reads and writes until after the backlog is fully
applied, or if it behaves in the manner of members running
MySQL 8.0.13 or earlier. If the
[`group_replication_consistency`](group-replication-system-variables.md#sysvar_group_replication_consistency)
variable was set to
`BEFORE_ON_PRIMARY_FAILOVER` on a newly
elected primary which has backlog to apply, and transactions
are issued against the new primary while it is still applying
the backlog, incoming transactions are blocked until the
backlog is fully applied. This prevents the following
anomalies:

- No stale reads for read-only and read/write transactions.
  This prevents stale reads from being externalized to the
  application by the new primary.
- No spurious rollbacks for read/write transactions, due to
  write-write conflicts with replicated read/write
  transactions still in the backlog waiting to be applied.
- No read skew on read/write transactions, such as this one:

  ```sql
  > BEGIN;
  > SELECT x FROM t1; -- x=1 because x=2 is in the backlog;
  > INSERT x INTO t2;
  > COMMIT;
  ```

  This query should not cause a conflict but writes outdated
  values.

To summarize, when
[`group_replication_consistency`](group-replication-system-variables.md#sysvar_group_replication_consistency)
is set to `BEFORE_ON_PRIMARY_FAILOVER` you
are choosing to prioritize consistency over availability,
because reads and writes are held whenever a new primary is
elected. This is the trade-off you have to consider when
configuring your group. It should also be remembered that if
flow control is working correctly, backlog should be minimal.
Note that the higher consistency levels
`BEFORE`, `AFTER`, and
`BEFORE_AND_AFTER` also include the
consistency guarantees provided by
`BEFORE_ON_PRIMARY_FAILOVER`.

To guarantee that the group provides the same consistency
level regardless of which member is promoted to primary, all
members of the group should have
`BEFORE_ON_PRIMARY_FAILOVER` (or a higher
consistency level) persisted to their configuration. For
example, on each member issue:

```sql
> SET PERSIST group_replication_consistency='BEFORE_ON_PRIMARY_FAILOVER';
```

This ensures that the members all behave in the same way, and
that the configuration is persisted after a restart of the
member.

A transaction cannot be on-hold forever, and if the time held
exceeds [`wait_timeout`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_wait_timeout) it
returns an ER\_GR\_HOLD\_WAIT\_TIMEOUT
error.

##### Permitted Queries Under Consistency Rules

Although all writes are held when using
`BEFORE_ON_PRIMARY_FAILOVER` consistency
level, not all reads are blocked to ensure that you can still
inspect the server while it is applying backlog after a
promotion took place. This is useful for debugging,
monitoring, observability and troubleshooting. Some queries
that do not modify data are allowed, such as the following:

- [`SHOW`](show.md "15.7.7 SHOW Statements") statements: In MySQL
  8.0.27 and later, these are restricted to those that do
  not depend on data, only on status and configuration.

  The [`SHOW`](show.md "15.7.7 SHOW Statements") statements that
  are allowed in MySQL 8.0.27 and later are `SHOW
  VARIABLES`, `SHOW PROCESSLIST`,
  `SHOW STATUS`, `SHOW ENGINE
  INNODB LOGS`, `SHOW ENGINE INNODB
  STATUS`, `SHOW ENGINE INNODB
  MUTEX`, `SHOW MASTER STATUS`,
  `SHOW REPLICA STATUS`, `SHOW
  CHARACTER SET`, `SHOW
  COLLATION`, `SHOW BINARY LOGS`,
  `SHOW OPEN TABLES`, `SHOW
  REPLICAS`, `SHOW BINLOG EVENTS`,
  `SHOW WARNINGS`, `SHOW
  ERRORS`, `SHOW ENGINES`,
  `SHOW PRIVILEGES`, `SHOW
  PROCEDURE STATUS`, `SHOW FUNCTION
  STATUS`, `SHOW PLUGINS,`,
  `SHOW EVENTS`, `SHOW
  PROFILE`, `SHOW PROFILES`, and
  `SHOW RELAYLOG EVENTS`.
- [`SET`](set.md "13.3.6 The SET Type") statements
- 1 [`DO`](do.md "15.2.3 DO Statement") statements that do not
  use tables or loadable functions
- `EMPTY` statements

  against the `performance_schema` and
  `sys` databases
- Using [`SELECT`](select.md "15.2.13 SELECT Statement") statements
  against the `PROCESSLIST` table from the
  `infoschema` database
- [`SELECT`](select.md "15.2.13 SELECT Statement") statements that do
  not use tables or loadable functions
