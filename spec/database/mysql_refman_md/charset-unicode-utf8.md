### 12.9.3 The utf8 Character Set (Deprecated alias for utf8mb3)

`utf8` has been used by MySQL in the past as an
alias for the `utf8mb3` character set, but this
usage is now deprecated; in MySQL 8.0,
[`SHOW`](show.md "15.7.7 SHOW Statements") statements and columns of
[`INFORMATION_SCHEMA`](information-schema.md "Chapter 28 INFORMATION_SCHEMA Tables") tables display
`utf8mb3` instead. For more information, see
[Section 12.9.2, “The utf8mb3 Character Set (3-Byte UTF-8 Unicode Encoding)”](charset-unicode-utf8mb3.md "12.9.2 The utf8mb3 Character Set (3-Byte UTF-8 Unicode Encoding)").

Note

The recommended character set for MySQL is
`utf8mb4`. All new applications should use
`utf8mb4`.

The `utf8mb3` character set is deprecated.
`utf8mb3` remains supported for the lifetimes
of the MySQL 8.0.x and following LTS release series, as well
as in MySQL 8.0.

Expect `utf8mb3` to be removed in a future
major release of MySQL.

Since changing character sets can be a complex and
time-consuming task, you should begin to prepare for this
change now by using `utf8mb4` for new
applications. For guidance in converting existing applications
which use utfmb3, see
[Section 12.9.8, “Converting Between 3-Byte and 4-Byte Unicode Character Sets”](charset-unicode-conversion.md "12.9.8 Converting Between 3-Byte and 4-Byte Unicode Character Sets").
