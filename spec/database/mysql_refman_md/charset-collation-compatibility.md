### 12.8.3 Character Set and Collation Compatibility

Each character set has one or more collations, but each
collation is associated with one and only one character set.
Therefore, the following statement causes an error message
because the `latin2_bin` collation is not legal
with the `latin1` character set:

```sql
mysql> SELECT _latin1 'x' COLLATE latin2_bin;
ERROR 1253 (42000): COLLATION 'latin2_bin' is not valid
for CHARACTER SET 'latin1'
```
