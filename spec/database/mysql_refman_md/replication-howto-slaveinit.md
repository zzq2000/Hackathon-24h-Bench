#### 19.1.2.7 Setting the Source Configuration on the Replica

To set up the replica to communicate with the source for
replication, configure the replica with the necessary connection
information. To do this, on the replica, execute the
[`CHANGE REPLICATION SOURCE TO`](change-replication-source-to.md "15.4.2.3 CHANGE REPLICATION SOURCE TO Statement")
statement (from MySQL 8.0.23) or [`CHANGE
MASTER TO`](change-master-to.md "15.4.2.1 CHANGE MASTER TO Statement") statement (before MySQL 8.0.23), replacing
the option values with the actual values relevant to your
system:

```sql
mysql> CHANGE MASTER TO
    ->     MASTER_HOST='source_host_name',
    ->     MASTER_USER='replication_user_name',
    ->     MASTER_PASSWORD='replication_password',
    ->     MASTER_LOG_FILE='recorded_log_file_name',
    ->     MASTER_LOG_POS=recorded_log_position;

Or from MySQL 8.0.23:
mysql> CHANGE REPLICATION SOURCE TO
    ->     SOURCE_HOST='source_host_name',
    ->     SOURCE_USER='replication_user_name',
    ->     SOURCE_PASSWORD='replication_password',
    ->     SOURCE_LOG_FILE='recorded_log_file_name',
    ->     SOURCE_LOG_POS=recorded_log_position;
```

Note

Replication cannot use Unix socket files. You must be able to
connect to the source MySQL server using TCP/IP.

The [`CHANGE REPLICATION SOURCE TO`](change-replication-source-to.md "15.4.2.3 CHANGE REPLICATION SOURCE TO Statement")
| [`CHANGE MASTER TO`](change-master-to.md "15.4.2.1 CHANGE MASTER TO Statement") statement has
other options as well. For example, it is possible to set up
secure replication using SSL. For a full list of options, and
information about the maximum permissible length for the
string-valued options, see [Section 15.4.2.1, “CHANGE MASTER TO Statement”](change-master-to.md "15.4.2.1 CHANGE MASTER TO Statement").

Important

As noted in [Section 19.1.2.3, “Creating a User for Replication”](replication-howto-repuser.md "19.1.2.3 Creating a User for Replication"), if
you are not using a secure connection and the user account
named in the `SOURCE_USER` |
`MASTER_USER` option authenticates with the
`caching_sha2_password` plugin (the default
from MySQL 8.0), you must specify the
`SOURCE_PUBLIC_KEY_PATH` |
`MASTER_PUBLIC_KEY_PATH` or
`GET_SOURCE_PUBLIC_KEY` |
`GET_MASTER_PUBLIC_KEY` option in the
[`CHANGE REPLICATION SOURCE TO`](change-replication-source-to.md "15.4.2.3 CHANGE REPLICATION SOURCE TO Statement") |
`CHANGE MASTER TO` statement to enable RSA
key pair-based password exchange.
