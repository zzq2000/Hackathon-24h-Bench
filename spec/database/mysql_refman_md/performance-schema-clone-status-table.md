Note

The Performance Schema table described here is available as
of MySQL 8.0.17.

The `clone_status` table shows the status of
the current or last executed cloning operation only. The table
only ever contains one row of data, or is empty.

The `clone_status` table has these columns:

- `ID`

  A unique cloning operation identifier in the current MySQL
  server instance.
- `PID`

  Process list ID of the session executing the cloning
  operation.
- `STATE`

  Current state of the cloning operation. Values include
  `Not Started`, `In
  Progress`, `Completed`, and
  `Failed`.
- `BEGIN_TIME`

  A timestamp in `'YYYY-MM-DD
  hh:mm:ss[.fraction]'`
  format that shows when the cloning operation started.
- `END_TIME`

  A timestamp in `'YYYY-MM-DD
  hh:mm:ss[.fraction]'`
  format that shows when the cloning operation finished.
  Reports NULL if the operation has not ended.
- `SOURCE`

  The donor MySQL server address in
  '`HOST:PORT`' format. The column displays
  '`LOCAL INSTANCE`' for a local cloning
  operation.
- `DESTINATION`

  The directory being cloned to.
- `ERROR_NO`

  The error number reported for a failed cloning operation.
- `ERROR_MESSAGE`

  The error message string for a failed cloning operation.
- `BINLOG_FILE`

  The name of the binary log file up to which data is
  cloned.
- `BINLOG_POSITION`

  The binary log file offset up to which data is cloned.
- `GTID_EXECUTED`

  The GTID value for the last cloned transaction.

The `clone_status` table is read-only. DDL,
including [`TRUNCATE TABLE`](truncate-table.md "15.1.37 TRUNCATE TABLE Statement"), is
not permitted.
