#### 17.20.6.4 Controlling Transactional Behavior of the InnoDB memcached Plugin

Unlike traditional **memcached**, the
`daemon_memcached` plugin allows you to control
durability of data values produced through calls to
`add`, `set`,
`incr`, and so on. By default, data written
through the **memcached** interface is stored to
disk, and calls to `get` return the most recent
value from disk. Although the default behavior does not offer
the best possible raw performance, it is still fast compared to
the SQL interface for `InnoDB` tables.

As you gain experience using the
`daemon_memcached` plugin, you can consider
relaxing durability settings for non-critical classes of data,
at the risk of losing some updated values in the event of an
outage, or returning data that is slightly out-of-date.

##### Frequency of Commits

One tradeoff between durability and raw performance is how
frequently new and changed data is
[committed](glossary.md#glos_commit "commit"). If data is
critical, is should be committed immediately so that it is safe
in case of an unexpected exit or outage. If data is less
critical, such as counters that are reset after an unexpected
exit or logging data that you can afford to lose, you might
prefer higher raw throughput that is available with less
frequent commits.

When a **memcached** operation inserts, updates,
or deletes data in the underlying `InnoDB`
table, the change might be committed to the
`InnoDB` table instantly (if
[`daemon_memcached_w_batch_size=1`](innodb-parameters.md#sysvar_daemon_memcached_w_batch_size))
or some time later (if the
[`daemon_memcached_w_batch_size`](innodb-parameters.md#sysvar_daemon_memcached_w_batch_size)
value is greater than 1). In either case, the change cannot be
rolled back. If you increase the value of
[`daemon_memcached_w_batch_size`](innodb-parameters.md#sysvar_daemon_memcached_w_batch_size)
to avoid high I/O overhead during busy times, commits could
become infrequent when the workload decreases. As a safety
measure, a background thread automatically commits changes made
through the **memcached** API at regular
intervals. The interval is controlled by the
[`innodb_api_bk_commit_interval`](innodb-parameters.md#sysvar_innodb_api_bk_commit_interval)
configuration option, which has a default setting of
`5` seconds.

When a **memcached** operation inserts or updates
data in the underlying `InnoDB` table, the
changed data is immediately visible to other
**memcached** requests because the new value
remains in the memory cache, even if it is not yet committed on
the MySQL side.

##### Transaction Isolation

When a **memcached** operation such as
`get` or `incr` causes a query
or DML operation on the underlying `InnoDB`
table, you can control whether the operation sees the very
latest data written to the table, only data that has been
committed, or other variations of transaction
[isolation level](glossary.md#glos_isolation_level "isolation level"). Use
the [`innodb_api_trx_level`](innodb-parameters.md#sysvar_innodb_api_trx_level)
configuration option to control this feature. The numeric values
specified for this option correspond to isolation levels such as
[`REPEATABLE READ`](innodb-transaction-isolation-levels.md#isolevel_repeatable-read). See the
description of the
[`innodb_api_trx_level`](innodb-parameters.md#sysvar_innodb_api_trx_level) option for
information about other settings.

A strict isolation level ensures that data you retrieve is not
rolled back or changed suddenly causing subsequent queries to
return different values. However, strict isolation levels
require greater [locking](glossary.md#glos_locking "locking")
overhead, which can cause waits. For a NoSQL-style application
that does not use long-running transactions, you can typically
use the default isolation level or switch to a less strict
isolation level.

##### Disabling Row Locks for memcached DML Operations

The [`innodb_api_disable_rowlock`](innodb-parameters.md#sysvar_innodb_api_disable_rowlock)
option can be used to disable row locks when
**memcached** requests through the
`daemon_memcached` plugin cause DML operations.
By default, `innodb_api_disable_rowlock` is set
to `OFF` which means that
**memcached** requests row locks for
`get` and `set` operations.
When `innodb_api_disable_rowlock` is set to
`ON`, **memcached** requests a
table lock instead of row locks.

The `innodb_api_disable_rowlock` option is not
dynamic. It must be specified at startup on the
[**mysqld**](mysqld.md "6.3.1 mysqld — The MySQL Server") command line or entered in a MySQL
configuration file.

##### Allowing or Disallowing DDL

By default, you can perform [DDL](glossary.md#glos_ddl "DDL")
operations such as [`ALTER TABLE`](alter-table.md "15.1.9 ALTER TABLE Statement") on
tables used by the `daemon_memcached` plugin.
To avoid potential slowdowns when these tables are used for
high-throughput applications, disable DDL operations on these
tables by enabling
[`innodb_api_enable_mdl`](innodb-parameters.md#sysvar_innodb_api_enable_mdl) at
startup. This option is less appropriate when accessing the same
tables through both **memcached** and SQL,
because it blocks [`CREATE INDEX`](create-index.md "15.1.15 CREATE INDEX Statement")
statements on the tables, which could be important for running
reporting queries.

##### Storing Data on Disk, in Memory, or Both

The `innodb_memcache.cache_policies` table
specifies whether to store data written through the
**memcached** interface to disk
(`innodb_only`, the default); in memory only,
as with traditional **memcached**
(`cache_only`); or both
(`caching`).

With the `caching` setting, if
**memcached** cannot find a key in memory, it
searches for the value in an `InnoDB` table.
Values returned from `get` calls under the
`caching` setting could be out-of-date if the
values were updated on disk in the `InnoDB`
table but are not yet expired from the memory cache.

The caching policy can be set independently for
`get`, `set` (including
`incr` and `decr`),
`delete`, and `flush`
operations.

For example, you might allow `get` and
`set` operations to query or update a table and
the **memcached** memory cache at the same time
(using the `caching` setting), while making
`delete`, `flush`, or both
operate only on the in-memory copy (using the
`cache_only` setting). That way, deleting or
flushing an item only expires the item from the cache, and the
latest value is returned from the `InnoDB`
table the next time the item is requested.

```sql
mysql> SELECT * FROM innodb_memcache.cache_policies;
+--------------+-------------+-------------+---------------+--------------+
| policy_name  | get_policy  | set_policy  | delete_policy | flush_policy |
+--------------+-------------+-------------+---------------+--------------+
| cache_policy | innodb_only | innodb_only | innodb_only   | innodb_only  |
+--------------+-------------+-------------+---------------+--------------+

mysql> UPDATE innodb_memcache.cache_policies SET set_policy = 'caching'
       WHERE policy_name = 'cache_policy';
```

`innodb_memcache.cache_policies` values are
only read at startup. After changing values in this table,
uninstall and reinstall the `daemon_memcached`
plugin to ensure that changes take effect.

```sql
mysql> UNINSTALL PLUGIN daemon_memcached;

mysql> INSTALL PLUGIN daemon_memcached soname "libmemcached.so";
```
