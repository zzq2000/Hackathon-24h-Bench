#### 7.1.9.5 Structured System Variables

A structured variable differs from a regular system variable in
two respects:

- Its value is a structure with components that specify server
  parameters considered to be closely related.
- There might be several instances of a given type of
  structured variable. Each one has a different name and
  refers to a different resource maintained by the server.

MySQL supports one structured variable type, which specifies
parameters governing the operation of key caches. A key cache
structured variable has these components:

- [`key_buffer_size`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_key_buffer_size)
- [`key_cache_block_size`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_key_cache_block_size)
- [`key_cache_division_limit`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_key_cache_division_limit)
- [`key_cache_age_threshold`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_key_cache_age_threshold)

This section describes the syntax for referring to structured
variables. Key cache variables are used for syntax examples, but
specific details about how key caches operate are found
elsewhere, in [Section 10.10.2, “The MyISAM Key Cache”](myisam-key-cache.md "10.10.2 The MyISAM Key Cache").

To refer to a component of a structured variable instance, you
can use a compound name in
*`instance_name.component_name`* format.
Examples:

```simple
hot_cache.key_buffer_size
hot_cache.key_cache_block_size
cold_cache.key_cache_block_size
```

For each structured system variable, an instance with the name
of `default` is always predefined. If you refer
to a component of a structured variable without any instance
name, the `default` instance is used. Thus,
`default.key_buffer_size` and
[`key_buffer_size`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_key_buffer_size) both refer to
the same system variable.

Structured variable instances and components follow these naming
rules:

- For a given type of structured variable, each instance must
  have a name that is unique *within*
  variables of that type. However, instance names need not be
  unique *across* structured variable
  types. For example, each structured variable has an instance
  named `default`, so
  `default` is not unique across variable
  types.
- The names of the components of each structured variable type
  must be unique across all system variable names. If this
  were not true (that is, if two different types of structured
  variables could share component member names), it would not
  be clear which default structured variable to use for
  references to member names that are not qualified by an
  instance name.
- If a structured variable instance name is not legal as an
  unquoted identifier, refer to it as a quoted identifier
  using backticks. For example, `hot-cache`
  is not legal, but `` `hot-cache` `` is.
- `global`, `session`, and
  `local` are not legal instance names. This
  avoids a conflict with notation such as
  `@@GLOBAL.var_name`
  for referring to nonstructured system variables.

Currently, the first two rules have no possibility of being
violated because the only structured variable type is the one
for key caches. These rules may assume greater significance if
some other type of structured variable is created in the future.

With one exception, you can refer to structured variable
components using compound names in any context where simple
variable names can occur. For example, you can assign a value to
a structured variable using a command-line option:

```terminal
$> mysqld --hot_cache.key_buffer_size=64K
```

In an option file, use this syntax:

```ini
[mysqld]
hot_cache.key_buffer_size=64K
```

If you start the server with this option, it creates a key cache
named `hot_cache` with a size of 64KB in
addition to the default key cache that has a default size of
8MB.

Suppose that you start the server as follows:

```terminal
$> mysqld --key_buffer_size=256K \
         --extra_cache.key_buffer_size=128K \
         --extra_cache.key_cache_block_size=2048
```

In this case, the server sets the size of the default key cache
to 256KB. (You could also have written
`--default.key_buffer_size=256K`.) In addition,
the server creates a second key cache named
`extra_cache` that has a size of 128KB, with
the size of block buffers for caching table index blocks set to
2048 bytes.

The following example starts the server with three different key
caches having sizes in a 3:1:1 ratio:

```terminal
$> mysqld --key_buffer_size=6M \
         --hot_cache.key_buffer_size=2M \
         --cold_cache.key_buffer_size=2M
```

Structured variable values may be set and retrieved at runtime
as well. For example, to set a key cache named
`hot_cache` to a size of 10MB, use either of
these statements:

```sql
mysql> SET GLOBAL hot_cache.key_buffer_size = 10*1024*1024;
mysql> SET @@GLOBAL.hot_cache.key_buffer_size = 10*1024*1024;
```

To retrieve the cache size, do this:

```sql
mysql> SELECT @@GLOBAL.hot_cache.key_buffer_size;
```

However, the following statement does not work. The variable is
not interpreted as a compound name, but as a simple string for a
[`LIKE`](string-comparison-functions.md#operator_like) pattern-matching operation:

```sql
mysql> SHOW GLOBAL VARIABLES LIKE 'hot_cache.key_buffer_size';
```

This is the exception to being able to use structured variable
names anywhere a simple variable name may occur.
