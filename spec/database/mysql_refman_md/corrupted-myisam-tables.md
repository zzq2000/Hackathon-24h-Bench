#### 18.2.4.1 Corrupted MyISAM Tables

Even though the `MyISAM` table format is very
reliable (all changes to a table made by an SQL statement are
written before the statement returns), you can still get
corrupted tables if any of the following events occur:

- The [**mysqld**](mysqld.md "6.3.1 mysqld — The MySQL Server") process is killed in the
  middle of a write.
- An unexpected computer shutdown occurs (for example, the
  computer is turned off).
- Hardware failures.
- You are using an external program (such as
  [**myisamchk**](myisamchk.md "6.6.4 myisamchk — MyISAM Table-Maintenance Utility")) to modify a table that is
  being modified by the server at the same time.
- A software bug in the MySQL or `MyISAM`
  code.

Typical symptoms of a corrupt table are:

- You get the following error while selecting data from the
  table:

  ```none
  Incorrect key file for table: '...'. Try to repair it
  ```
- Queries don't find rows in the table or return incomplete
  results.

You can check the health of a `MyISAM` table
using the [`CHECK TABLE`](check-table.md "15.7.3.2 CHECK TABLE Statement") statement,
and repair a corrupted `MyISAM` table with
[`REPAIR TABLE`](repair-table.md "15.7.3.5 REPAIR TABLE Statement"). When
[**mysqld**](mysqld.md "6.3.1 mysqld — The MySQL Server") is not running, you can also check or
repair a table with the [**myisamchk**](myisamchk.md "6.6.4 myisamchk — MyISAM Table-Maintenance Utility") command.
See [Section 15.7.3.2, “CHECK TABLE Statement”](check-table.md "15.7.3.2 CHECK TABLE Statement"),
[Section 15.7.3.5, “REPAIR TABLE Statement”](repair-table.md "15.7.3.5 REPAIR TABLE Statement"), and [Section 6.6.4, “myisamchk — MyISAM Table-Maintenance Utility”](myisamchk.md "6.6.4 myisamchk — MyISAM Table-Maintenance Utility").

If your tables become corrupted frequently, you should try to
determine why this is happening. The most important thing to
know is whether the table became corrupted as a result of an
unexpected server exit. You can verify this easily by looking
for a recent `restarted mysqld` message in the
error log. If there is such a message, it is likely that table
corruption is a result of the server dying. Otherwise,
corruption may have occurred during normal operation. This is a
bug. You should try to create a reproducible test case that
demonstrates the problem. See [Section B.3.3.3, “What to Do If MySQL Keeps Crashing”](crashing.md "B.3.3.3 What to Do If MySQL Keeps Crashing"), and
[Section 7.9, “Debugging MySQL”](debugging-mysql.md "7.9 Debugging MySQL").
