#### 19.2.5.1 Evaluation of Database-Level Replication and Binary Logging Options

When evaluating replication options, the replica begins by
checking to see whether there are any
[`--replicate-do-db`](replication-options-replica.md#option_mysqld_replicate-do-db) or
[`--replicate-ignore-db`](replication-options-replica.md#option_mysqld_replicate-ignore-db) options
that apply. When using
[`--binlog-do-db`](replication-options-binary-log.md#option_mysqld_binlog-do-db) or
[`--binlog-ignore-db`](replication-options-binary-log.md#option_mysqld_binlog-ignore-db), the process
is similar, but the options are checked on the source.

The database that is checked for a match depends on the binary
log format of the statement that is being handled. If the
statement has been logged using the row format, the database
where data is to be changed is the database that is checked. If
the statement has been logged using the statement format, the
default database (specified with a
[`USE`](use.md "15.8.4 USE Statement") statement) is the database
that is checked.

Note

Only DML statements can be logged using the row format. DDL
statements are always logged as statements, even when
[`binlog_format=ROW`](replication-options-binary-log.md#sysvar_binlog_format). All DDL
statements are therefore always filtered according to the
rules for statement-based replication. This means that you
must select the default database explicitly with a
[`USE`](use.md "15.8.4 USE Statement") statement in order for a
DDL statement to be applied.

For replication, the steps involved are listed here:

1. Which logging format is used?

   - **STATEMENT.**
     Test the default database.
   - **ROW.**
     Test the database affected by the changes.
2. Are there any
   [`--replicate-do-db`](replication-options-replica.md#option_mysqld_replicate-do-db) options?

   - **Yes.**
     Does the database match any of them?

     - **Yes.**
       Continue to Step 4.
     - **No.**
       Ignore the update and exit.
   - **No.**
     Continue to step 3.
3. Are there any
   [`--replicate-ignore-db`](replication-options-replica.md#option_mysqld_replicate-ignore-db)
   options?

   - **Yes.**
     Does the database match any of them?

     - **Yes.**
       Ignore the update and exit.
     - **No.**
       Continue to step 4.
   - **No.**
     Continue to step 4.
4. Proceed to checking the table-level replication options, if
   there are any. For a description of how these options are
   checked, see
   [Section 19.2.5.2, “Evaluation of Table-Level Replication Options”](replication-rules-table-options.md "19.2.5.2 Evaluation of Table-Level Replication Options").

   Important

   A statement that is still permitted at this stage is not
   yet actually executed. The statement is not executed until
   all table-level options (if any) have also been checked,
   and the outcome of that process permits execution of the
   statement.

For binary logging, the steps involved are listed here:

1. Are there any [`--binlog-do-db`](replication-options-binary-log.md#option_mysqld_binlog-do-db)
   or [`--binlog-ignore-db`](replication-options-binary-log.md#option_mysqld_binlog-ignore-db)
   options?

   - **Yes.**
     Continue to step 2.
   - **No.**
     Log the statement and exit.
2. Is there a default database (has any database been selected
   by [`USE`](use.md "15.8.4 USE Statement"))?

   - **Yes.**
     Continue to step 3.
   - **No.**
     Ignore the statement and exit.
3. There is a default database. Are there any
   [`--binlog-do-db`](replication-options-binary-log.md#option_mysqld_binlog-do-db) options?

   - **Yes.**
     Do any of them match the database?

     - **Yes.**
       Log the statement and exit.
     - **No.**
       Ignore the statement and exit.
   - **No.**
     Continue to step 4.
4. Do any of the
   [`--binlog-ignore-db`](replication-options-binary-log.md#option_mysqld_binlog-ignore-db) options
   match the database?

   - **Yes.**
     Ignore the statement and exit.
   - **No.**
     Log the statement and exit.

Important

For statement-based logging, an exception is made in the rules
just given for the [`CREATE
DATABASE`](create-database.md "15.1.12 CREATE DATABASE Statement"), [`ALTER
DATABASE`](alter-database.md "15.1.2 ALTER DATABASE Statement"), and [`DROP
DATABASE`](drop-database.md "15.1.24 DROP DATABASE Statement") statements. In those cases, the database
being *created, altered, or dropped*
replaces the default database when determining whether to log
or ignore updates.

[`--binlog-do-db`](replication-options-binary-log.md#option_mysqld_binlog-do-db) can sometimes mean
“ignore other databases”. For example, when using
statement-based logging, a server running with only
[`--binlog-do-db=sales`](replication-options-binary-log.md#option_mysqld_binlog-do-db) does not
write to the binary log statements for which the default
database differs from `sales`. When using
row-based logging with the same option, the server logs only
those updates that change data in `sales`.
