### 2.8.2 Source Installation Prerequisites

Installation of MySQL from source requires several development
tools. Some of these tools are needed no matter whether you use a
standard source distribution or a development source tree. Other
tool requirements depend on which installation method you use.

To install MySQL from source, the following system requirements
must be satisfied, regardless of installation method:

- **CMake**, which is used as the build framework
  on all platforms. **CMake** can be downloaded
  from <http://www.cmake.org>.
- A good **make** program. Although some
  platforms come with their own **make**
  implementations, it is highly recommended that you use GNU
  **make** 3.75 or later. It may already be
  available on your system as **gmake**. GNU
  **make** is available from
  <http://www.gnu.org/software/make/>.

  On Unix-like systems, including Linux, you can check your
  system's version of **make** like this:

  ```terminal
  $> make --version
  GNU Make 4.2.1
  ```
- As of MySQL 8.0.26, MySQL 8.0 source code permits
  use of C++17 features. To enable the necessary level of C++17
  support across all supported platforms, the following minimum
  compiler versions apply:

  - Linux: GCC 10 or Clang 5
  - macOS: XCode 10
  - Solaris: (*MySQL 8.0.40 and earlier*)
    GCC 10; (*MySQL 8.0.41 and later*) GCC
    11.4
  - Windows: Visual Studio 2019
- Building MySQL on Windows requires Windows version 10 or
  later. (MySQL binaries built on recent versions of Windows can
  generally be run on older versions.) You can determine the
  Windows version by executing **WMIC.exe
  os get version** in the Windows Command Prompt.
- The MySQL C API requires a C++ or C99 compiler to compile.
- An SSL library is required for support of encrypted
  connections, entropy for random number generation, and other
  encryption-related operations. By default, the build uses the
  OpenSSL library installed on the host system. To specify the
  library explicitly, use the
  [`WITH_SSL`](source-configuration-options.md#option_cmake_with_ssl) option when you invoke
  **CMake**. For additional information, see
  [Section 2.8.6, “Configuring SSL Library Support”](source-ssl-library-configuration.md "2.8.6 Configuring SSL Library Support").
- The Boost C++ libraries are required to build MySQL (but not
  to use it). MySQL compilation requires a particular Boost
  version. Typically, that is the current Boost version, but if
  a specific MySQL source distribution requires a different
  version, the configuration process stops with a message
  indicating the Boost version that it requires. To obtain Boost
  and its installation instructions, visit
  [the official Boost web
  site](https://www.boost.org). After Boost is installed, tell the build system
  where the Boost files are placed according to the value set
  for the [`WITH_BOOST`](source-configuration-options.md#option_cmake_with_boost) option when
  you invoke CMake. For example:

  ```terminal
  cmake . -DWITH_BOOST=/usr/local/boost_version_number
  ```

  Adjust the path as necessary to match your installation.
- The
  [ncurses](https://www.gnu.org/software/ncurses/ncurses.html)
  library.
- Sufficient free memory. If you encounter build errors such as
  internal compiler error when compiling
  large source files, it may be that you have too little memory.
  If compiling on a virtual machine, try increasing the memory
  allocation.
- Perl is needed if you intend to run test scripts. Most
  Unix-like systems include Perl. For Windows, you can use
  [ActiveState
  Perl](https://www.activestate.com/products/perl/). or
  [Strawberry
  Perl](https://strawberryperl.com/).

To install MySQL from a standard source distribution, one of the
following tools is required to unpack the distribution file:

- For a `.tar.gz` compressed
  **tar** file: GNU `gunzip` to
  uncompress the distribution and a reasonable
  **tar** to unpack it. If your
  **tar** program supports the
  `z` option, it can both uncompress and unpack
  the file.

  GNU **tar** is known to work. The standard
  **tar** provided with some operating systems is
  not able to unpack the long file names in the MySQL
  distribution. You should download and install GNU
  **tar**, or if available, use a preinstalled
  version of GNU tar. Usually this is available as
  **gnutar**, **gtar**, or as
  **tar** within a GNU or Free Software
  directory, such as `/usr/sfw/bin` or
  `/usr/local/bin`. GNU
  **tar** is available from
  <https://www.gnu.org/software/tar/>.
- For a `.zip` Zip archive:
  **WinZip** or another tool that can read
  `.zip` files.
- For an `.rpm` RPM package: The
  **rpmbuild** program used to build the
  distribution unpacks it.

To install MySQL from a development source tree, the following
additional tools are required:

- The Git revision control system is required to obtain the
  development source code.
  [GitHub Help](https://help.github.com/)
  provides instructions for downloading and installing Git on
  different platforms.
- **bison** 2.1 or later, available from
  <http://www.gnu.org/software/bison/>. (Version 1
  is no longer supported.) Use the latest version of
  **bison** where possible; if you experience
  problems, upgrade to a later version, rather than revert to an
  earlier one.

  **bison** is available from
  <http://www.gnu.org/software/bison/>.
  `bison` for Windows can be downloaded from
  <http://gnuwin32.sourceforge.net/packages/bison.htm>.
  Download the package labeled “Complete package,
  excluding sources”. On Windows, the default location
  for **bison** is the `C:\Program
  Files\GnuWin32` directory. Some utilities may fail
  to find **bison** because of the space in the
  directory name. Also, Visual Studio may simply hang if there
  are spaces in the path. You can resolve these problems by
  installing into a directory that does not contain a space (for
  example `C:\GnuWin32`).
- On Solaris Express, **m4** must be installed in
  addition to **bison**. **m4** is
  available from <http://www.gnu.org/software/m4/>.

Note

If you have to install any programs, modify your
`PATH` environment variable to include any
directories in which the programs are located. See
[Section 6.2.9, “Setting Environment Variables”](setting-environment-variables.md "6.2.9 Setting Environment Variables").

If you run into problems and need to file a bug report, please use
the instructions in [Section 1.5, “How to Report Bugs or Problems”](bug-reports.md "1.5 How to Report Bugs or Problems").
