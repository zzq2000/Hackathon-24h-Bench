#### 15.7.2.2 CREATE RESOURCE GROUP Statement

```sql
CREATE RESOURCE GROUP group_name
    TYPE = {SYSTEM|USER}
    [VCPU [=] vcpu_spec [, vcpu_spec] ...]
    [THREAD_PRIORITY [=] N]
    [ENABLE|DISABLE]

vcpu_spec: {N | M - N}
```

[`CREATE RESOURCE GROUP`](create-resource-group.md "15.7.2.2 CREATE RESOURCE GROUP Statement") is used for
resource group management (see
[Section 7.1.16, “Resource Groups”](resource-groups.md "7.1.16 Resource Groups")). This statement creates a new
resource group and assigns its initial attribute values. It
requires the [`RESOURCE_GROUP_ADMIN`](privileges-provided.md#priv_resource-group-admin)
privilege.

*`group_name`* identifies which resource
group to create. If the group already exists, an error occurs.

The `TYPE` attribute is required. It should be
`SYSTEM` for a system resource group,
`USER` for a user resource group. The group
type affects permitted `THREAD_PRIORITY`
values, as described later.

The `VCPU` attribute indicates the CPU
affinity; that is, the set of virtual CPUs the group can use:

- If `VCPU` is not given, the resource group
  has no CPU affinity and can use all available CPUs.
- If `VCPU` is given, the attribute value is
  a list of comma-separated CPU numbers or ranges:

  - Each number must be an integer in the range from 0 to
    the number of CPUs − 1. For example, on a system
    with 64 CPUs, the number can range from 0 to 63.
  - A range is given in the form
    *`M`* −
    *`N`*, where
    *`M`* is less than or equal to
    *`N`* and both numbers are in the
    CPU range.
  - If a CPU number is an integer outside the permitted
    range or is not an integer, an error occurs.

Example `VCPU` specifiers (these are all
equivalent):

```sql
VCPU = 0,1,2,3,9,10
VCPU = 0-3,9-10
VCPU = 9,10,0-3
VCPU = 0,10,1,9,3,2
```

The `THREAD_PRIORITY` attribute indicates the
priority for threads assigned to the group:

- If `THREAD_PRIORITY` is not given, the
  default priority is 0.
- If `THREAD_PRIORITY` is given, the
  attribute value must be in the range from -20 (highest
  priority) to 19 (lowest priority). The priority for system
  resource groups must be in the range from -20 to 0. The
  priority for user resource groups must be in the range from
  0 to 19. Use of different ranges for system and user groups
  ensures that user threads never have a higher priority than
  system threads.

`ENABLE` and `DISABLE` specify
that the resource group is initially enabled or disabled. If
neither is specified, the group is enabled by default. A
disabled group cannot have threads assigned to it.

Examples:

- Create an enabled user group that has a single CPU and the
  lowest priority:

  ```sql
  CREATE RESOURCE GROUP rg1
    TYPE = USER
    VCPU = 0
    THREAD_PRIORITY = 19;
  ```
- Create a disabled system group that has no CPU affinity (can
  use all CPUs) and the highest priority:

  ```sql
  CREATE RESOURCE GROUP rg2
    TYPE = SYSTEM
    THREAD_PRIORITY = -20
    DISABLE;
  ```

Resource group management is local to the server on which it
occurs. [`CREATE RESOURCE GROUP`](create-resource-group.md "15.7.2.2 CREATE RESOURCE GROUP Statement")
statements are not written to the binary log and are not
replicated.
