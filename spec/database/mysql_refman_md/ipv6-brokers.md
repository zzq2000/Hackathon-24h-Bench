#### 7.1.13.5 Obtaining an IPv6 Address from a Broker

If you do not have a public IPv6 address that enables your
system to communicate over IPv6 outside your local network, you
can obtain one from an IPv6 broker. The
[Wikipedia
IPv6 Tunnel Broker page](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_IPv6_tunnel_brokers) lists several brokers and their
features, such as whether they provide static addresses and the
supported routing protocols.

After configuring your server host to use a broker-supplied IPv6
address, start the MySQL server with an appropriate
[`bind_address`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_bind_address) setting to permit
the server to accept IPv6 connections. You can specify \* (or
`::`) as the
[`bind_address`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_bind_address) value, or bind the
server to the specific IPv6 address provided by the broker. For
more information, see the
[`bind_address`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_bind_address) description in
[Section 7.1.8, “Server System Variables”](server-system-variables.md "7.1.8 Server System Variables").

Note that if the broker allocates dynamic addresses, the address
provided for your system might change the next time you connect
to the broker. If so, any accounts you create that name the
original address become invalid. To bind to a specific address
but avoid this change-of-address problem, you might be able to
arrange with the broker for a static IPv6 address.

The following example shows how to use Freenet6 as the broker
and the **gogoc** IPv6 client package on Gentoo
Linux.

1. Create an account at Freenet6 by visiting this URL and
   signing up:

   ```simple
   http://gogonet.gogo6.com
   ```
2. After creating the account, go to this URL, sign in, and
   create a user ID and password for the IPv6 broker:

   ```simple
   http://gogonet.gogo6.com/page/freenet6-registration
   ```
3. As `root`, install
   **gogoc**:

   ```terminal
   $> emerge gogoc
   ```
4. Edit `/etc/gogoc/gogoc.conf` to set the
   `userid` and `password`
   values. For example:

   ```ini
   userid=gogouser
   passwd=gogopass
   ```
5. Start **gogoc**:

   ```terminal
   $> /etc/init.d/gogoc start
   ```

   To start **gogoc** each time your system
   boots, execute this command:

   ```terminal
   $> rc-update add gogoc default
   ```
6. Use **ping6** to try to ping a host:

   ```terminal
   $> ping6 ipv6.google.com
   ```
7. To see your IPv6 address:

   ```terminal
   $> ifconfig tun
   ```
