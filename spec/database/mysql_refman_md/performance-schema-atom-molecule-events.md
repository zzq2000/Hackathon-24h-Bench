## 29.8 Performance Schema Atom and Molecule Events

For a table I/O event, there are usually two rows in
[`events_waits_current`](performance-schema-events-waits-current-table.md "29.12.4.1 The events_waits_current Table"), not one. For
example, a row fetch might result in rows like this:

```none
Row# EVENT_NAME                 TIMER_START TIMER_END
---- ----------                 ----------- ---------
   1 wait/io/file/myisam/dfile        10001 10002
   2 wait/io/table/sql/handler        10000 NULL
```

The row fetch causes a file read. In the example, the table I/O
fetch event started before the file I/O event but has not finished
(its `TIMER_END` value is
`NULL`). The file I/O event is
“nested” within the table I/O event.

This occurs because, unlike other “atomic” wait
events such as for mutexes or file I/O, table I/O events are
“molecular” and include (overlap with) other events.
In [`events_waits_current`](performance-schema-events-waits-current-table.md "29.12.4.1 The events_waits_current Table"), the table
I/O event usually has two rows:

- One row for the most recent table I/O wait event
- One row for the most recent wait event of any kind

Usually, but not always, the “of any kind” wait event
differs from the table I/O event. As each subsidiary event
completes, it disappears from
[`events_waits_current`](performance-schema-events-waits-current-table.md "29.12.4.1 The events_waits_current Table"). At this point,
and until the next subsidiary event begins, the table I/O wait is
also the most recent wait of any kind.
