#### 30.4.3.4 The host\_summary\_by\_stages and x$host\_summary\_by\_stages Views

These views summarize statement stages, grouped by host. By
default, rows are sorted by host and descending total latency.

The [`host_summary_by_stages`](sys-host-summary-by-stages.md "30.4.3.4 The host_summary_by_stages and x$host_summary_by_stages Views") and
[`x$host_summary_by_stages`](sys-host-summary-by-stages.md "30.4.3.4 The host_summary_by_stages and x$host_summary_by_stages Views") views
have these columns:

- `host`

  The host from which the client connected. Rows for which
  the `HOST` column in the underlying
  Performance Schema table is `NULL` are
  assumed to be for background threads and are reported with
  a host name of `background`.
- `event_name`

  The stage event name.
- `total`

  The total number of occurrences of the stage event for the
  host.
- `total_latency`

  The total wait time of timed occurrences of the stage
  event for the host.
- `avg_latency`

  The average wait time per timed occurrence of the stage
  event for the host.
