#### 8.7.5.2 Setting the TCP Port Context for MySQL Features

If you enable certain MySQL features, you might need to set the
SELinux TCP port context for additional ports used by those
features. If ports used by MySQL features do not have the
correct SELinux context, the features might not function
correctly.

The following sections describe how to set port contexts for
MySQL features. Generally, the same method can be used to set
the port context for any MySQL features. For information about
ports used by MySQL features, refer to the
[MySQL Port Reference](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/mysql-port-reference/en/).

From MySQL 8.0.14 to MySQL 8.0.17, the
`mysql_connect_any` SELinux boolean must be set
to `ON`. As of MySQL 8.0.18, enabling
`mysql_connect_any` is not required or
recommended.

```simple
setsebool -P mysql_connect_any=ON
```

##### Setting the TCP Port Context for Group Replication

If SELinux is enabled, you must set the port context for the
Group Replication communication port, which is defined by the
[`group_replication_local_address`](group-replication-system-variables.md#sysvar_group_replication_local_address)
variable. [**mysqld**](mysqld.md "6.3.1 mysqld — The MySQL Server") must be able to bind to
the Group Replication communication port and listen there.
InnoDB Cluster relies on Group Replication so this applies
equally to instances used in a cluster. To view ports
currently used by MySQL, issue:

```simple
semanage port -l | grep mysqld
```

Assuming the Group Replication communication port is 33061,
set the port context by issuing:

```simple
semanage port -a -t mysqld_port_t -p tcp 33061
```

##### Setting the TCP Port Context for Document Store

If SELinux is enabled, you must set the port context for the
communication port used by X Plugin, which is defined by the
[`mysqlx_port`](x-plugin-options-system-variables.md#sysvar_mysqlx_port) variable.
[**mysqld**](mysqld.md "6.3.1 mysqld — The MySQL Server") must be able to bind to the
X Plugin communication port and listen there.

Assuming the X Plugin communication port is 33060, set the
port context by issuing:

```simple
semanage port -a -t mysqld_port_t -p tcp 33060
```

##### Setting the TCP Port Context for MySQL Router

If SELinux is enabled, you must set the port context for the
communication ports used by MySQL Router. Assuming the additional
communication ports used by MySQL Router are the default 6446,
6447, 64460 and 64470, on each instance set the port context
by issuing:

```simple
semanage port -a -t mysqld_port_t -p tcp 6446
semanage port -a -t mysqld_port_t -p tcp 6447
semanage port -a -t mysqld_port_t -p tcp 64460
semanage port -a -t mysqld_port_t -p tcp 64470
```
