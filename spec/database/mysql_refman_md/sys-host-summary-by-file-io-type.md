#### 30.4.3.3 The host\_summary\_by\_file\_io\_type and x$host\_summary\_by\_file\_io\_type Views

These views summarize file I/O, grouped by host and event
type. By default, rows are sorted by host and descending total
I/O latency.

The [`host_summary_by_file_io_type`](sys-host-summary-by-file-io-type.md "30.4.3.3 The host_summary_by_file_io_type and x$host_summary_by_file_io_type Views")
and
[`x$host_summary_by_file_io_type`](sys-host-summary-by-file-io-type.md "30.4.3.3 The host_summary_by_file_io_type and x$host_summary_by_file_io_type Views")
views have these columns:

- `host`

  The host from which the client connected. Rows for which
  the `HOST` column in the underlying
  Performance Schema table is `NULL` are
  assumed to be for background threads and are reported with
  a host name of `background`.
- `event_name`

  The file I/O event name.
- `total`

  The total number of occurrences of the file I/O event for
  the host.
- `total_latency`

  The total wait time of timed occurrences of the file I/O
  event for the host.
- `max_latency`

  The maximum single wait time of timed occurrences of the
  file I/O event for the host.
