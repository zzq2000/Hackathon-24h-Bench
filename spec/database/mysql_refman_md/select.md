[`SELECT`](select.md "15.2.13 SELECT Statement") is used to retrieve rows
selected from one or more tables, and can include
[`UNION`](union.md "15.2.18 UNION Clause") operations and subqueries.
Beginning with MySQL 8.0.31,
[`INTERSECT`](intersect.md "15.2.8 INTERSECT Clause") and
[`EXCEPT`](except.md "15.2.4 EXCEPT Clause") operations are also
supported. The `UNION`,
`INTERSECT`, and `EXCEPT`
operators are described in more detail later in this section. See
also [Section 15.2.15, “Subqueries”](subqueries.md "15.2.15 Subqueries").

A [`SELECT`](select.md "15.2.13 SELECT Statement") statement can start with a
[`WITH`](with.md "15.2.20 WITH (Common Table Expressions)") clause to define common table
expressions accessible within the
[`SELECT`](select.md "15.2.13 SELECT Statement"). See [Section 15.2.20, “WITH (Common Table Expressions)”](with.md "15.2.20 WITH (Common Table Expressions)").

The most commonly used clauses of
[`SELECT`](select.md "15.2.13 SELECT Statement") statements are these:

- Each *`select_expr`* indicates a column
  that you want to retrieve. There must be at least one
  *`select_expr`*.
- *`table_references`* indicates the
  table or tables from which to retrieve rows. Its syntax is
  described in [Section 15.2.13.2, “JOIN Clause”](join.md "15.2.13.2 JOIN Clause").
- `SELECT` supports explicit partition
  selection using the `PARTITION` clause with a
  list of partitions or subpartitions (or both) following the
  name of the table in a
  *`table_reference`* (see
  [Section 15.2.13.2, “JOIN Clause”](join.md "15.2.13.2 JOIN Clause")). In this case, rows are selected only
  from the partitions listed, and any other partitions of the
  table are ignored. For more information and examples, see
  [Section 26.5, “Partition Selection”](partitioning-selection.md "26.5 Partition Selection").
- The `WHERE` clause, if given, indicates the
  condition or conditions that rows must satisfy to be selected.
  *`where_condition`* is an expression
  that evaluates to true for each row to be selected. The
  statement selects all rows if there is no
  `WHERE` clause.

  In the `WHERE` expression, you can use any of
  the functions and operators that MySQL supports, except for
  aggregate (group) functions. See
  [Section 11.5, “Expressions”](expressions.md "11.5 Expressions"), and
  [Chapter 14, *Functions and Operators*](functions.md "Chapter 14 Functions and Operators").

[`SELECT`](select.md "15.2.13 SELECT Statement") can also be used to retrieve
rows computed without reference to any table.

For example:

```sql
mysql> SELECT 1 + 1;
        -> 2
```

You are permitted to specify `DUAL` as a dummy
table name in situations where no tables are referenced:

```sql
mysql> SELECT 1 + 1 FROM DUAL;
        -> 2
```

`DUAL` is purely for the convenience of people
who require that all [`SELECT`](select.md "15.2.13 SELECT Statement")
statements should have `FROM` and possibly other
clauses. MySQL may ignore the clauses. MySQL does not require
`FROM DUAL` if no tables are referenced.

In general, clauses used must be given in exactly the order shown
in the syntax description. For example, a
`HAVING` clause must come after any
`GROUP BY` clause and before any `ORDER
BY` clause. The `INTO` clause, if
present, can appear in any position indicated by the syntax
description, but within a given statement can appear only once,
not in multiple positions. For more information about
`INTO`, see [Section 15.2.13.1, “SELECT ... INTO Statement”](select-into.md "15.2.13.1 SELECT ... INTO Statement").

The list of *`select_expr`* terms comprises
the select list that indicates which columns to retrieve. Terms
specify a column or expression or can use
`*`-shorthand:

- A select list consisting only of a single unqualified
  `*` can be used as shorthand to select all
  columns from all tables:

  ```sql
  SELECT * FROM t1 INNER JOIN t2 ...
  ```
- `tbl_name.*` can
  be used as a qualified shorthand to select all columns from
  the named table:

  ```sql
  SELECT t1.*, t2.* FROM t1 INNER JOIN t2 ...
  ```
- If a table has invisible columns, `*` and
  `tbl_name.*` do
  not include them. To be included, invisible columns must be
  referenced explicitly.
- Use of an unqualified `*` with other items in
  the select list may produce a parse error. For example:

  ```sql
  SELECT id, * FROM t1
  ```

  To avoid this problem, use a qualified
  `tbl_name.*`
  reference:

  ```sql
  SELECT id, t1.* FROM t1
  ```

  Use qualified
  `tbl_name.*`
  references for each table in the select list:

  ```sql
  SELECT AVG(score), t1.* FROM t1 ...
  ```

The following list provides additional information about other
`SELECT` clauses:

- A *`select_expr`* can be given an alias
  using `AS
  alias_name`. The alias is
  used as the expression's column name and can be used in
  `GROUP BY`, `ORDER BY`, or
  `HAVING` clauses. For example:

  ```sql
  SELECT CONCAT(last_name,', ',first_name) AS full_name
    FROM mytable ORDER BY full_name;
  ```

  The `AS` keyword is optional when aliasing a
  *`select_expr`* with an identifier. The
  preceding example could have been written like this:

  ```sql
  SELECT CONCAT(last_name,', ',first_name) full_name
    FROM mytable ORDER BY full_name;
  ```

  However, because the `AS` is optional, a
  subtle problem can occur if you forget the comma between two
  *`select_expr`* expressions: MySQL
  interprets the second as an alias name. For example, in the
  following statement, `columnb` is treated as
  an alias name:

  ```sql
  SELECT columna columnb FROM mytable;
  ```

  For this reason, it is good practice to be in the habit of
  using `AS` explicitly when specifying column
  aliases.

  It is not permissible to refer to a column alias in a
  `WHERE` clause, because the column value
  might not yet be determined when the `WHERE`
  clause is executed. See [Section B.3.4.4, “Problems with Column Aliases”](problems-with-alias.md "B.3.4.4 Problems with Column Aliases").
- The `FROM
  table_references` clause
  indicates the table or tables from which to retrieve rows. If
  you name more than one table, you are performing a join. For
  information on join syntax, see [Section 15.2.13.2, “JOIN Clause”](join.md "15.2.13.2 JOIN Clause"). For
  each table specified, you can optionally specify an alias.

  ```sql
  tbl_name [[AS] alias] [index_hint]
  ```

  The use of index hints provides the optimizer with information
  about how to choose indexes during query processing. For a
  description of the syntax for specifying these hints, see
  [Section 10.9.4, “Index Hints”](index-hints.md "10.9.4 Index Hints").

  You can use `SET
  max_seeks_for_key=value`
  as an alternative way to force MySQL to prefer key scans
  instead of table scans. See
  [Section 7.1.8, “Server System Variables”](server-system-variables.md "7.1.8 Server System Variables").
- You can refer to a table within the default database as
  *`tbl_name`*, or as
  *`db_name`*.*`tbl_name`*
  to specify a database explicitly. You can refer to a column as
  *`col_name`*,
  *`tbl_name`*.*`col_name`*,
  or
  *`db_name`*.*`tbl_name`*.*`col_name`*.
  You need not specify a *`tbl_name`* or
  *`db_name`*.*`tbl_name`*
  prefix for a column reference unless the reference would be
  ambiguous. See [Section 11.2.2, “Identifier Qualifiers”](identifier-qualifiers.md "11.2.2 Identifier Qualifiers"), for
  examples of ambiguity that require the more explicit column
  reference forms.
- A table reference can be aliased using
  `tbl_name AS
  alias_name` or
  *`tbl_name alias_name`*. These
  statements are equivalent:

  ```sql
  SELECT t1.name, t2.salary FROM employee AS t1, info AS t2
    WHERE t1.name = t2.name;

  SELECT t1.name, t2.salary FROM employee t1, info t2
    WHERE t1.name = t2.name;
  ```
- Columns selected for output can be referred to in
  `ORDER BY` and `GROUP BY`
  clauses using column names, column aliases, or column
  positions. Column positions are integers and begin with 1:

  ```sql
  SELECT college, region, seed FROM tournament
    ORDER BY region, seed;

  SELECT college, region AS r, seed AS s FROM tournament
    ORDER BY r, s;

  SELECT college, region, seed FROM tournament
    ORDER BY 2, 3;
  ```

  To sort in reverse order, add the `DESC`
  (descending) keyword to the name of the column in the
  `ORDER BY` clause that you are sorting by.
  The default is ascending order; this can be specified
  explicitly using the `ASC` keyword.

  If `ORDER BY` occurs within a parenthesized
  query expression and also is applied in the outer query, the
  results are undefined and may change in a future version of
  MySQL.

  Use of column positions is deprecated because the syntax has
  been removed from the SQL standard.
- Prior to MySQL 8.0.13, MySQL supported a nonstandard syntax
  extension that permitted explicit `ASC` or
  `DESC` designators for `GROUP
  BY` columns. MySQL 8.0.12 and later supports
  `ORDER BY` with grouping functions so that
  use of this extension is no longer necessary. (Bug #86312, Bug
  #26073525) This also means you can sort on an arbitrary column
  or columns when using `GROUP BY`, like this:

  ```sql
  SELECT a, b, COUNT(c) AS t FROM test_table GROUP BY a,b ORDER BY a,t DESC;
  ```

  As of MySQL 8.0.13, the `GROUP BY` extension
  is no longer supported: `ASC` or
  `DESC` designators for `GROUP
  BY` columns are not permitted.
- When you use `ORDER BY` or `GROUP
  BY` to sort a column in a
  [`SELECT`](select.md "15.2.13 SELECT Statement"), the server sorts values
  using only the initial number of bytes indicated by the
  [`max_sort_length`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_max_sort_length) system
  variable.
- MySQL extends the use of `GROUP BY` to permit
  selecting fields that are not mentioned in the `GROUP
  BY` clause. If you are not getting the results that
  you expect from your query, please read the description of
  `GROUP BY` found in
  [Section 14.19, “Aggregate Functions”](aggregate-functions-and-modifiers.md "14.19 Aggregate Functions").
- `GROUP BY` permits a `WITH
  ROLLUP` modifier. See
  [Section 14.19.2, “GROUP BY Modifiers”](group-by-modifiers.md "14.19.2 GROUP BY Modifiers").

  Previously, it was not permitted to use `ORDER
  BY` in a query having a `WITH
  ROLLUP` modifier. This restriction is lifted as of
  MySQL 8.0.12. See [Section 14.19.2, “GROUP BY Modifiers”](group-by-modifiers.md "14.19.2 GROUP BY Modifiers").
- The `HAVING` clause, like the
  `WHERE` clause, specifies selection
  conditions. The `WHERE` clause specifies
  conditions on columns in the select list, but cannot refer to
  aggregate functions. The `HAVING` clause
  specifies conditions on groups, typically formed by the
  `GROUP BY` clause. The query result includes
  only groups satisfying the `HAVING`
  conditions. (If no `GROUP BY` is present, all
  rows implicitly form a single aggregate group.)

  The `HAVING` clause is applied nearly last,
  just before items are sent to the client, with no
  optimization. (`LIMIT` is applied after
  `HAVING`.)

  The SQL standard requires that `HAVING` must
  reference only columns in the `GROUP BY`
  clause or columns used in aggregate functions. However, MySQL
  supports an extension to this behavior, and permits
  `HAVING` to refer to columns in the
  [`SELECT`](select.md "15.2.13 SELECT Statement") list and columns in
  outer subqueries as well.

  If the `HAVING` clause refers to a column
  that is ambiguous, a warning occurs. In the following
  statement, `col2` is ambiguous because it is
  used as both an alias and a column name:

  ```sql
  SELECT COUNT(col1) AS col2 FROM t GROUP BY col2 HAVING col2 = 2;
  ```

  Preference is given to standard SQL behavior, so if a
  `HAVING` column name is used both in
  `GROUP BY` and as an aliased column in the
  select column list, preference is given to the column in the
  `GROUP BY` column.
- Do not use `HAVING` for items that should be
  in the `WHERE` clause. For example, do not
  write the following:

  ```sql
  SELECT col_name FROM tbl_name HAVING col_name > 0;
  ```

  Write this instead:

  ```sql
  SELECT col_name FROM tbl_name WHERE col_name > 0;
  ```
- The `HAVING` clause can refer to aggregate
  functions, which the `WHERE` clause cannot:

  ```sql
  SELECT user, MAX(salary) FROM users
    GROUP BY user HAVING MAX(salary) > 10;
  ```

  (This did not work in some older versions of MySQL.)
- MySQL permits duplicate column names. That is, there can be
  more than one *`select_expr`* with the
  same name. This is an extension to standard SQL. Because MySQL
  also permits `GROUP BY` and
  `HAVING` to refer to
  *`select_expr`* values, this can result
  in an ambiguity:

  ```sql
  SELECT 12 AS a, a FROM t GROUP BY a;
  ```

  In that statement, both columns have the name
  `a`. To ensure that the correct column is
  used for grouping, use different names for each
  *`select_expr`*.
- The `WINDOW` clause, if present, defines
  named windows that can be referred to by window functions. For
  details, see [Section 14.20.4, “Named Windows”](window-functions-named-windows.md "14.20.4 Named Windows").
- MySQL resolves unqualified column or alias references in
  `ORDER BY` clauses by searching in the
  *`select_expr`* values, then in the
  columns of the tables in the `FROM` clause.
  For `GROUP BY` or `HAVING`
  clauses, it searches the `FROM` clause before
  searching in the *`select_expr`*
  values. (For `GROUP BY` and
  `HAVING`, this differs from the pre-MySQL 5.0
  behavior that used the same rules as for `ORDER
  BY`.)
- The `LIMIT` clause can be used to constrain
  the number of rows returned by the
  [`SELECT`](select.md "15.2.13 SELECT Statement") statement.
  `LIMIT` takes one or two numeric arguments,
  which must both be nonnegative integer constants, with these
  exceptions:

  - Within prepared statements, `LIMIT`
    parameters can be specified using `?`
    placeholder markers.
  - Within stored programs, `LIMIT`
    parameters can be specified using integer-valued routine
    parameters or local variables.

  With two arguments, the first argument specifies the offset of
  the first row to return, and the second specifies the maximum
  number of rows to return. The offset of the initial row is 0
  (not 1):

  ```sql
  SELECT * FROM tbl LIMIT 5,10;  # Retrieve rows 6-15
  ```

  To retrieve all rows from a certain offset up to the end of
  the result set, you can use some large number for the second
  parameter. This statement retrieves all rows from the 96th row
  to the last:

  ```sql
  SELECT * FROM tbl LIMIT 95,18446744073709551615;
  ```

  With one argument, the value specifies the number of rows to
  return from the beginning of the result set:

  ```sql
  SELECT * FROM tbl LIMIT 5;     # Retrieve first 5 rows
  ```

  In other words, `LIMIT
  row_count` is equivalent
  to `LIMIT 0,
  row_count`.

  For prepared statements, you can use placeholders. The
  following statements return one row from the
  `tbl` table:

  ```sql
  SET @a=1;
  PREPARE STMT FROM 'SELECT * FROM tbl LIMIT ?';
  EXECUTE STMT USING @a;
  ```

  The following statements return the second to sixth rows from
  the `tbl` table:

  ```sql
  SET @skip=1; SET @numrows=5;
  PREPARE STMT FROM 'SELECT * FROM tbl LIMIT ?, ?';
  EXECUTE STMT USING @skip, @numrows;
  ```

  For compatibility with PostgreSQL, MySQL also supports the
  `LIMIT row_count OFFSET
  offset` syntax.

  If `LIMIT` occurs within a parenthesized
  query expression and also is applied in the outer query, the
  results are undefined and may change in a future version of
  MySQL.
- The [`SELECT ...
  INTO`](select-into.md "15.2.13.1 SELECT ... INTO Statement") form of [`SELECT`](select.md "15.2.13 SELECT Statement")
  enables the query result to be written to a file or stored in
  variables. For more information, see
  [Section 15.2.13.1, “SELECT ... INTO Statement”](select-into.md "15.2.13.1 SELECT ... INTO Statement").
- If you use `FOR UPDATE` with a storage engine
  that uses page or row locks, rows examined by the query are
  write-locked until the end of the current transaction.

  You cannot use `FOR UPDATE` as part of the
  [`SELECT`](select.md "15.2.13 SELECT Statement") in a statement such as
  [`CREATE
  TABLE new_table SELECT ... FROM
  old_table ...`](create-table-select.md "15.1.20.4 CREATE TABLE ... SELECT Statement"). (If you
  attempt to do so, the statement is rejected with the error
  Can't update table
  '*`old_table`*' while
  '*`new_table`*' is being
  created.)

  `FOR SHARE` and `LOCK IN SHARE
  MODE` set shared locks that permit other transactions
  to read the examined rows but not to update or delete them.
  `FOR SHARE` and `LOCK IN SHARE
  MODE` are equivalent. However, `FOR
  SHARE`, like `FOR UPDATE`, supports
  `NOWAIT`, `SKIP LOCKED`, and
  `OF tbl_name`
  options. `FOR SHARE` is a replacement for
  `LOCK IN SHARE MODE`, but `LOCK IN
  SHARE MODE` remains available for backward
  compatibility.

  `NOWAIT` causes a `FOR
  UPDATE` or `FOR SHARE` query to
  execute immediately, returning an error if a row lock cannot
  be obtained due to a lock held by another transaction.

  `SKIP LOCKED` causes a `FOR
  UPDATE` or `FOR SHARE` query to
  execute immediately, excluding rows from the result set that
  are locked by another transaction.

  `NOWAIT` and `SKIP LOCKED`
  options are unsafe for statement-based replication.

  Note

  Queries that skip locked rows return an inconsistent view of
  the data. `SKIP LOCKED` is therefore not
  suitable for general transactional work. However, it may be
  used to avoid lock contention when multiple sessions access
  the same queue-like table.

  `OF tbl_name`
  applies `FOR UPDATE` and `FOR
  SHARE` queries to named tables. For example:

  ```sql
  SELECT * FROM t1, t2 FOR SHARE OF t1 FOR UPDATE OF t2;
  ```

  All tables referenced by the query block are locked when
  `OF tbl_name` is
  omitted. Consequently, using a locking clause without
  `OF tbl_name` in
  combination with another locking clause returns an error.
  Specifying the same table in multiple locking clauses returns
  an error. If an alias is specified as the table name in the
  `SELECT` statement, a locking clause may only
  use the alias. If the `SELECT` statement does
  not specify an alias explicitly, the locking clause may only
  specify the actual table name.

  For more information about `FOR UPDATE` and
  `FOR SHARE`, see
  [Section 17.7.2.4, “Locking Reads”](innodb-locking-reads.md "17.7.2.4 Locking Reads"). For additional
  information about `NOWAIT` and `SKIP
  LOCKED` options, see
  [Locking Read Concurrency with NOWAIT and SKIP LOCKED](innodb-locking-reads.md#innodb-locking-reads-nowait-skip-locked "Locking Read Concurrency with NOWAIT and SKIP LOCKED").

Following the [`SELECT`](select.md "15.2.13 SELECT Statement") keyword, you
can use a number of modifiers that affect the operation of the
statement. `HIGH_PRIORITY`,
`STRAIGHT_JOIN`, and modifiers beginning with
`SQL_` are MySQL extensions to standard SQL.

- The `ALL` and `DISTINCT`
  modifiers specify whether duplicate rows should be returned.
  `ALL` (the default) specifies that all
  matching rows should be returned, including duplicates.
  `DISTINCT` specifies removal of duplicate
  rows from the result set. It is an error to specify both
  modifiers. `DISTINCTROW` is a synonym for
  `DISTINCT`.

  In MySQL 8.0.12 and later, `DISTINCT` can be
  used with a query that also uses `WITH
  ROLLUP`. (Bug #87450, Bug #26640100)
- `HIGH_PRIORITY` gives the
  [`SELECT`](select.md "15.2.13 SELECT Statement") higher priority than a
  statement that updates a table. You should use this only for
  queries that are very fast and must be done at once. A
  `SELECT HIGH_PRIORITY` query that is issued
  while the table is locked for reading runs even if there is an
  update statement waiting for the table to be free. This
  affects only storage engines that use only table-level locking
  (such as `MyISAM`, `MEMORY`,
  and `MERGE`).

  `HIGH_PRIORITY` cannot be used with
  [`SELECT`](select.md "15.2.13 SELECT Statement") statements that are part
  of a [`UNION`](union.md "15.2.18 UNION Clause").
- `STRAIGHT_JOIN` forces the optimizer to join
  the tables in the order in which they are listed in the
  `FROM` clause. You can use this to speed up a
  query if the optimizer joins the tables in nonoptimal order.
  `STRAIGHT_JOIN` also can be used in the
  *`table_references`* list. See
  [Section 15.2.13.2, “JOIN Clause”](join.md "15.2.13.2 JOIN Clause").

  `STRAIGHT_JOIN` does not apply to any table
  that the optimizer treats as a
  [`const`](explain-output.md#jointype_const) or
  [`system`](explain-output.md#jointype_system) table. Such a table
  produces a single row, is read during the optimization phase
  of query execution, and references to its columns are replaced
  with the appropriate column values before query execution
  proceeds. These tables appear first in the query plan
  displayed by [`EXPLAIN`](explain.md "15.8.2 EXPLAIN Statement"). See
  [Section 10.8.1, “Optimizing Queries with EXPLAIN”](using-explain.md "10.8.1 Optimizing Queries with EXPLAIN"). This exception may not apply
  to [`const`](explain-output.md#jointype_const) or
  [`system`](explain-output.md#jointype_system) tables that are used
  on the `NULL`-complemented side of an outer
  join (that is, the right-side table of a `LEFT
  JOIN` or the left-side table of a `RIGHT
  JOIN`.
- `SQL_BIG_RESULT` or
  `SQL_SMALL_RESULT` can be used with
  `GROUP BY` or `DISTINCT` to
  tell the optimizer that the result set has many rows or is
  small, respectively. For `SQL_BIG_RESULT`,
  MySQL directly uses disk-based temporary tables if they are
  created, and prefers sorting to using a temporary table with a
  key on the `GROUP BY` elements. For
  `SQL_SMALL_RESULT`, MySQL uses in-memory
  temporary tables to store the resulting table instead of using
  sorting. This should not normally be needed.
- `SQL_BUFFER_RESULT` forces the result to be
  put into a temporary table. This helps MySQL free the table
  locks early and helps in cases where it takes a long time to
  send the result set to the client. This modifier can be used
  only for top-level [`SELECT`](select.md "15.2.13 SELECT Statement")
  statements, not for subqueries or following
  [`UNION`](union.md "15.2.18 UNION Clause").
- `SQL_CALC_FOUND_ROWS` tells MySQL to
  calculate how many rows there would be in the result set,
  disregarding any `LIMIT` clause. The number
  of rows can then be retrieved with `SELECT
  FOUND_ROWS()`. See
  [Section 14.15, “Information Functions”](information-functions.md "14.15 Information Functions").

  Note

  The `SQL_CALC_FOUND_ROWS` query modifier
  and accompanying [`FOUND_ROWS()`](information-functions.md#function_found-rows)
  function are deprecated as of MySQL 8.0.17; expect them to
  be removed in a future version of MySQL. See the
  [`FOUND_ROWS()`](information-functions.md#function_found-rows) description for
  information about an alternative strategy.
- The `SQL_CACHE` and
  `SQL_NO_CACHE` modifiers were used with the
  query cache prior to MySQL 8.0. The query cache
  was removed in MySQL 8.0. The
  `SQL_CACHE` modifier was removed as well.
  `SQL_NO_CACHE` is deprecated, and has no
  effect; expect it to be removed in a future MySQL release.
