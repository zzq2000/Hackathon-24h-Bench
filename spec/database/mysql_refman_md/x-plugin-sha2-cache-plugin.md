### 22.5.4 Using X Plugin with the Caching SHA-2 Authentication Plugin

X Plugin supports MySQL user accounts created with the
`caching_sha2_password` authentication plugin.
For more information on this plugin, see
[Section 8.4.1.2, “Caching SHA-2 Pluggable Authentication”](caching-sha2-pluggable-authentication.md "8.4.1.2 Caching SHA-2 Pluggable Authentication"). You can
use X Plugin to authenticate against such accounts using non-SSL
connections with `SHA256_MEMORY` authentication
and SSL connections with `PLAIN` authentication.

Although the `caching_sha2_password`
authentication plugin holds an authentication cache, this cache is
not shared with X Plugin, so X Plugin uses its own
authentication cache for `SHA256_MEMORY`
authentication. The X Plugin authentication cache stores hashes
of user account passwords, and cannot be accessed using SQL. If a
user account is modified or removed, the relevant entries are
removed from the cache. The X Plugin authentication cache is
maintained by the `mysqlx_cache_cleaner` plugin,
which is enabled by default, and has no related system variables
or status variables.

Before you can use non-SSL X Protocol connections to authenticate
an account that uses the `caching_sha2_password`
authentication plugin, the account must have authenticated at
least once over an X Protocol connection with SSL, to supply the
password to the X Plugin authentication cache. Once this initial
authentication over SSL has succeeded, non-SSL X Protocol
connections can be used.

It is possible to disable the
`mysqlx_cache_cleaner` plugin by starting the
MySQL server with the option
`--mysqlx_cache_cleaner=0`. If you do this, the
X Plugin authentication cache is disabled, and therefore SSL must
always be used for X Protocol connections when authenticating
with `SHA256_MEMORY` authentication.
