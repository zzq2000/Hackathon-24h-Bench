### 12.3.8 Character Set Introducers

A character string literal, hexadecimal literal, or bit-value
literal may have an optional character set introducer and
`COLLATE` clause, to designate it as a string
that uses a particular character set and collation:

```sql
[_charset_name] literal [COLLATE collation_name]
```

The `_charset_name`
expression is formally called an
*introducer*. It tells the parser, “the
string that follows uses character set
*`charset_name`*.” An introducer
does not change the string to the introducer character set like
[`CONVERT()`](cast-functions.md#function_convert) would do. It does not
change the string value, although padding may occur. The
introducer is just a signal.

For character string literals, space between the introducer and
the string is permitted but optional.

For character set literals, an introducer indicates the
character set for the following string, but does not change how
the parser performs escape processing within the string. Escapes
are always interpreted by the parser according to the character
set given by
[`character_set_connection`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_character_set_connection). For
additional discussion and examples, see
[Section 12.3.6, “Character String Literal Character Set and Collation”](charset-literal.md "12.3.6 Character String Literal Character Set and Collation").

Examples:

```sql
SELECT 'abc';
SELECT _latin1'abc';
SELECT _binary'abc';
SELECT _utf8mb4'abc' COLLATE utf8mb4_danish_ci;

SELECT _latin1 X'4D7953514C';
SELECT _utf8mb4 0x4D7953514C COLLATE utf8mb4_danish_ci;

SELECT _latin1 b'1000001';
SELECT _utf8mb4 0b1000001 COLLATE utf8mb4_danish_ci;
```

Character set introducers and the `COLLATE`
clause are implemented according to standard SQL specifications.

Character string literals can be designated as binary strings by
using the `_binary` introducer. Hexadecimal
literals and bit-value literals are binary strings by default,
so `_binary` is permitted, but normally
unnecessary. `_binary` may be useful to
preserve a hexadecimal or bit literal as a binary string in
contexts for which the literal is otherwise treated as a number.
For example, bit operations permit numeric or binary string
arguments in MySQL 8.0 and higher, but treat
hexadecimal and bit literals as numbers by default. To
explicitly specify binary string context for such literals, use
a `_binary` introducer for at least one of the
arguments:

```sql
mysql> SET @v1 = X'000D' | X'0BC0';
mysql> SET @v2 = _binary X'000D' | X'0BC0';
mysql> SELECT HEX(@v1), HEX(@v2);
+----------+----------+
| HEX(@v1) | HEX(@v2) |
+----------+----------+
| BCD      | 0BCD     |
+----------+----------+
```

The displayed result appears similar for both bit operations,
but the result without `_binary` is a
`BIGINT` value, whereas the result with
`_binary` is a binary string. Due to the
difference in result types, the displayed values differ:
High-order 0 digits are not displayed for the numeric result.

MySQL determines the character set and collation of a character
string literal, hexadecimal literal, or bit-value literal in the
following manner:

- If both *`_charset_name`* and
  `COLLATE
  collation_name` are
  specified, character set
  *`charset_name`* and collation
  *`collation_name`* are used.
  *`collation_name`* must be a
  permitted collation for
  *`charset_name`*.
- If *`_charset_name`* is specified but
  `COLLATE` is not specified, character set
  *`charset_name`* and its default
  collation are used. To see the default collation for each
  character set, use the [`SHOW CHARACTER
  SET`](show-character-set.md "15.7.7.3 SHOW CHARACTER SET Statement") statement or query the
  `INFORMATION_SCHEMA`
  [`CHARACTER_SETS`](information-schema-character-sets-table.md "28.3.4 The INFORMATION_SCHEMA CHARACTER_SETS Table") table.
- If *`_charset_name`* is not specified
  but `COLLATE
  collation_name` is
  specified:

  - For a character string literal, the connection default
    character set given by the
    [`character_set_connection`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_character_set_connection)
    system variable and collation
    *`collation_name`* are used.
    *`collation_name`* must be a
    permitted collation for the connection default character
    set.
  - For a hexadecimal literal or bit-value literal, the only
    permitted collation is `binary` because
    these types of literals are binary strings by default.
- Otherwise (neither *`_charset_name`*
  nor `COLLATE
  collation_name` is
  specified):

  - For a character string literal, the connection default
    character set and collation given by the
    [`character_set_connection`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_character_set_connection)
    and
    [`collation_connection`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_collation_connection)
    system variables are used.
  - For a hexadecimal literal or bit-value literal, the
    character set and collation are
    `binary`.

Examples:

- Nonbinary strings with `latin1` character
  set and `latin1_german1_ci` collation:

  ```sql
  SELECT _latin1'Müller' COLLATE latin1_german1_ci;
  SELECT _latin1 X'0A0D' COLLATE latin1_german1_ci;
  SELECT _latin1 b'0110' COLLATE latin1_german1_ci;
  ```
- Nonbinary strings with `utf8mb4` character
  set and its default collation (that is,
  `utf8mb4_0900_ai_ci`):

  ```sql
  SELECT _utf8mb4'Müller';
  SELECT _utf8mb4 X'0A0D';
  SELECT _utf8mb4 b'0110';
  ```
- Binary strings with `binary` character set
  and its default collation (that is,
  `binary`):

  ```sql
  SELECT _binary'Müller';
  SELECT X'0A0D';
  SELECT b'0110';
  ```

  The hexadecimal literal and bit-value literal need no
  introducer because they are binary strings by default.
- A nonbinary string with the connection default character set
  and `utf8mb4_0900_ai_ci` collation (fails
  if the connection character set is not
  `utf8mb4`):

  ```sql
  SELECT 'Müller' COLLATE utf8mb4_0900_ai_ci;
  ```

  This construction (`COLLATE` only) does not
  work for hexadecimal literals or bit literals because their
  character set is `binary` no matter the
  connection character set, and `binary` is
  not compatible with the
  `utf8mb4_0900_ai_ci` collation. The only
  permitted `COLLATE` clause in the absence
  of an introducer is `COLLATE binary`.
- A string with the connection default character set and
  collation:

  ```sql
  SELECT 'Müller';
  ```
