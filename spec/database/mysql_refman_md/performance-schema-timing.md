### 29.4.1 Performance Schema Event Timing

Events are collected by means of instrumentation added to the
server source code. Instruments time events, which is how the
Performance Schema provides an idea of how long events take. It
is also possible to configure instruments not to collect timing
information. This section discusses the available timers and
their characteristics, and how timing values are represented in
events.

#### Performance Schema Timers

Performance Schema timers vary in precision and amount of
overhead. To see what timers are available and their
characteristics, check the
[`performance_timers`](performance-schema-performance-timers-table.md "29.12.21.6 The performance_timers Table") table:

```sql
mysql> SELECT * FROM performance_schema.performance_timers;
+-------------+-----------------+------------------+----------------+
| TIMER_NAME  | TIMER_FREQUENCY | TIMER_RESOLUTION | TIMER_OVERHEAD |
+-------------+-----------------+------------------+----------------+
| CYCLE       |      2389029850 |                1 |             72 |
| NANOSECOND  |      1000000000 |                1 |            112 |

If the values associated with a given timer name are
`NULL`, that timer is not supported on your
platform.

The columns have these meanings:

- The `TIMER_NAME` column shows the names
  of the available timers. `CYCLE` refers
  to the timer that is based on the CPU (processor) cycle
  counter.
- `TIMER_FREQUENCY` indicates the number of
  timer units per second. For a cycle timer, the frequency
  is generally related to the CPU speed. The value shown was
  obtained on a system with a 2.4GHz processor. The other
  timers are based on fixed fractions of seconds.
- `TIMER_RESOLUTION` indicates the number
  of timer units by which timer values increase at a time.
  If a timer has a resolution of 10, its value increases by
  10 each time.
- `TIMER_OVERHEAD` is the minimal number of
  cycles of overhead to obtain one timing with the given
  timer. The overhead per event is twice the value displayed
  because the timer is invoked at the beginning and end of
  the event.

The Performance Schema assigns timers as follows:

- The wait timer uses `CYCLE`.
- The idle, stage, statement, and transaction timers use
  `NANOSECOND` on platforms where the
  `NANOSECOND` timer is available,
  `MICROSECOND` otherwise.

At server startup, the Performance Schema verifies that
assumptions made at build time about timer assignments are
correct, and displays a warning if a timer is not available.

To time wait events, the most important criterion is to reduce
overhead, at the possible expense of the timer accuracy, so
using the `CYCLE` timer is the best.

The time a statement (or stage) takes to execute is in general
orders of magnitude larger than the time it takes to execute a
single wait. To time statements, the most important criterion
is to have an accurate measure, which is not affected by
changes in processor frequency, so using a timer which is not
based on cycles is the best. The default timer for statements
is `NANOSECOND`. The extra
“overhead” compared to the
`CYCLE` timer is not significant, because the
overhead caused by calling a timer twice (once when the
statement starts, once when it ends) is orders of magnitude
less compared to the CPU time used to execute the statement
itself. Using the `CYCLE` timer has no
benefit here, only drawbacks.

The precision offered by the cycle counter depends on
processor speed. If the processor runs at 1 GHz (one billion
cycles/second) or higher, the cycle counter delivers
sub-nanosecond precision. Using the cycle counter is much
cheaper than getting the actual time of day. For example, the
standard `gettimeofday()` function can take
hundreds of cycles, which is an unacceptable overhead for data
gathering that may occur thousands or millions of times per
second.

Cycle counters also have disadvantages:

- End users expect to see timings in wall-clock units, such
  as fractions of a second. Converting from cycles to
  fractions of seconds can be expensive. For this reason,
  the conversion is a quick and fairly rough multiplication
  operation.
- Processor cycle rate might change, such as when a laptop
  goes into power-saving mode or when a CPU slows down to
  reduce heat generation. If a processor's cycle rate
  fluctuates, conversion from cycles to real-time units is
  subject to error.
- Cycle counters might be unreliable or unavailable
  depending on the processor or the operating system. For
  example, on Pentiums, the instruction is
  `RDTSC` (an assembly-language rather than
  a C instruction) and it is theoretically possible for the
  operating system to prevent user-mode programs from using
  it.
- Some processor details related to out-of-order execution
  or multiprocessor synchronization might cause the counter
  to seem fast or slow by up to 1000 cycles.

MySQL works with cycle counters on x386 (Windows, macOS,
Linux, Solaris, and other Unix flavors), PowerPC, and IA-64.

#### Performance Schema Timer Representation in Events

Rows in Performance Schema tables that store current events
and historical events have three columns to represent timing
information: `TIMER_START` and
`TIMER_END` indicate when an event started
and finished, and `TIMER_WAIT` indicates
event duration.

The [`setup_instruments`](performance-schema-setup-instruments-table.md "29.12.2.3 The setup_instruments Table") table has
an `ENABLED` column to indicate the
instruments for which to collect events. The table also has a
`TIMED` column to indicate which instruments
are timed. If an instrument is not enabled, it produces no
events. If an enabled instrument is not timed, events produced
by the instrument have `NULL` for the
`TIMER_START`, `TIMER_END`,
and `TIMER_WAIT` timer values. This in turn
causes those values to be ignored when calculating aggregate
time values in summary tables (sum, minimum, maximum, and
average).

Internally, times within events are stored in units given by
the timer in effect when event timing begins. For display when
events are retrieved from Performance Schema tables, times are
shown in picoseconds (trillionths of a second) to normalize
them to a standard unit, regardless of which timer is
selected.

The timer baseline (“time zero”) occurs at
Performance Schema initialization during server startup.
`TIMER_START` and
`TIMER_END` values in events represent
picoseconds since the baseline. `TIMER_WAIT`
values are durations in picoseconds.

Picosecond values in events are approximate. Their accuracy is
subject to the usual forms of error associated with conversion
from one unit to another. If the `CYCLE`
timer is used and the processor rate varies, there might be
drift. For these reasons, it is not reasonable to look at the
`TIMER_START` value for an event as an
accurate measure of time elapsed since server startup. On the
other hand, it is reasonable to use
`TIMER_START` or
`TIMER_WAIT` values in `ORDER
BY` clauses to order events by start time or
duration.

The choice of picoseconds in events rather than a value such
as microseconds has a performance basis. One implementation
goal was to show results in a uniform time unit, regardless of
the timer. In an ideal world this time unit would look like a
wall-clock unit and be reasonably precise; in other words,
microseconds. But to convert cycles or nanoseconds to
microseconds, it would be necessary to perform a division for
every instrumentation. Division is expensive on many
platforms. Multiplication is not expensive, so that is what is
used. Therefore, the time unit is an integer multiple of the
highest possible `TIMER_FREQUENCY` value,
using a multiplier large enough to ensure that there is no
major precision loss. The result is that the time unit is
“picoseconds.” This precision is spurious, but
the decision enables overhead to be minimized.

While a wait, stage, statement, or transaction event is
executing, the respective current-event tables display
current-event timing information:

```none
events_waits_current
events_stages_current
events_statements_current
events_transactions_current
```

To make it possible to determine how long a not-yet-completed
event has been running, the timer columns are set as follows:

- `TIMER_START` is populated.
- `TIMER_END` is populated with the current
  timer value.
- `TIMER_WAIT` is populated with the time
  elapsed so far (`TIMER_END` −
  `TIMER_START`).

Events that have not yet completed have an
`END_EVENT_ID` value of
`NULL`. To assess time elapsed so far for an
event, use the `TIMER_WAIT` column.
Therefore, to identify events that have not yet completed and
have taken longer than *`N`*
picoseconds thus far, monitoring applications can use this
expression in queries:

```sql
WHERE END_EVENT_ID IS NULL AND TIMER_WAIT > N
```

Event identification as just described assumes that the
corresponding instruments have `ENABLED` and
`TIMED` set to `YES` and
that the relevant consumers are enabled.
