### 11.1.2 Numeric Literals

Number literals include exact-value (integer and
[`DECIMAL`](fixed-point-types.md "13.1.3 Fixed-Point Types (Exact Value) - DECIMAL, NUMERIC")) literals and
approximate-value (floating-point) literals.

Integers are represented as a sequence of digits. Numbers may
include `.` as a decimal separator. Numbers may
be preceded by `-` or `+` to
indicate a negative or positive value, respectively. Numbers
represented in scientific notation with a mantissa and exponent
are approximate-value numbers.

Exact-value numeric literals have an integer part or fractional
part, or both. They may be signed. Examples:
`1`, `.2`,
`3.4`, `-5`,
`-6.78`, `+9.10`.

Approximate-value numeric literals are represented in scientific
notation with a mantissa and exponent. Either or both parts may
be signed. Examples: `1.2E3`,
`1.2E-3`, `-1.2E3`,
`-1.2E-3`.

Two numbers that look similar may be treated differently. For
example, `2.34` is an exact-value (fixed-point)
number, whereas `2.34E0` is an
approximate-value (floating-point) number.

The [`DECIMAL`](fixed-point-types.md "13.1.3 Fixed-Point Types (Exact Value) - DECIMAL, NUMERIC") data type is a
fixed-point type and calculations are exact. In MySQL, the
[`DECIMAL`](fixed-point-types.md "13.1.3 Fixed-Point Types (Exact Value) - DECIMAL, NUMERIC") type has several
synonyms: [`NUMERIC`](fixed-point-types.md "13.1.3 Fixed-Point Types (Exact Value) - DECIMAL, NUMERIC"),
[`DEC`](fixed-point-types.md "13.1.3 Fixed-Point Types (Exact Value) - DECIMAL, NUMERIC"),
[`FIXED`](fixed-point-types.md "13.1.3 Fixed-Point Types (Exact Value) - DECIMAL, NUMERIC"). The integer types also are
exact-value types. For more information about exact-value
calculations, see [Section 14.24, “Precision Math”](precision-math.md "14.24 Precision Math").

The [`FLOAT`](floating-point-types.md "13.1.4 Floating-Point Types (Approximate Value) - FLOAT, DOUBLE") and
[`DOUBLE`](floating-point-types.md "13.1.4 Floating-Point Types (Approximate Value) - FLOAT, DOUBLE") data types are
floating-point types and calculations are approximate. In MySQL,
types that are synonymous with
[`FLOAT`](floating-point-types.md "13.1.4 Floating-Point Types (Approximate Value) - FLOAT, DOUBLE") or
[`DOUBLE`](floating-point-types.md "13.1.4 Floating-Point Types (Approximate Value) - FLOAT, DOUBLE") are
[`DOUBLE PRECISION`](floating-point-types.md "13.1.4 Floating-Point Types (Approximate Value) - FLOAT, DOUBLE") and
[`REAL`](floating-point-types.md "13.1.4 Floating-Point Types (Approximate Value) - FLOAT, DOUBLE").

An integer may be used in floating-point context; it is
interpreted as the equivalent floating-point number.
