### 15.2.6 IMPORT TABLE Statement

```sql
IMPORT TABLE FROM sdi_file [, sdi_file] ...
```

The [`IMPORT TABLE`](import-table.md "15.2.6 IMPORT TABLE Statement") statement imports
`MyISAM` tables based on information contained in
`.sdi` (serialized dictionary information)
metadata files. [`IMPORT TABLE`](import-table.md "15.2.6 IMPORT TABLE Statement")
requires the [`FILE`](privileges-provided.md#priv_file) privilege to read
the `.sdi` and table content files, and the
[`CREATE`](privileges-provided.md#priv_create) privilege for the table to
be created.

Tables can be exported from one server using
[**mysqldump**](mysqldump.md "6.5.4 mysqldump — A Database Backup Program") to write a file of SQL statements and
imported into another server using [**mysql**](mysql.md "6.5.1 mysql — The MySQL Command-Line Client") to
process the dump file. [`IMPORT TABLE`](import-table.md "15.2.6 IMPORT TABLE Statement")
provides a faster alternative using the “raw” table
files.

Prior to import, the files that provide the table content must be
placed in the appropriate schema directory for the import server,
and the `.sdi` file must be located in a
directory accessible to the server. For example, the
`.sdi` file can be placed in the directory
named by the [`secure_file_priv`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_secure_file_priv)
system variable, or (if
[`secure_file_priv`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_secure_file_priv) is empty) in a
directory under the server data directory.

The following example describes how to export
`MyISAM` tables named
`employees` and `managers` from
the `hr` schema of one server and import them
into the `hr` schema of another server. The
example uses these assumptions (to perform a similar operation on
your own system, modify the path names as appropriate):

- For the export server,
  *`export_basedir`* represents its base
  directory, and its data directory is
  `export_basedir/data`.
- For the import server,
  *`import_basedir`* represents its base
  directory, and its data directory is
  `import_basedir/data`.
- Table files are exported from the export server into the
  `/tmp/export` directory and this directory
  is secure (not accessible to other users).
- The import server uses `/tmp/mysql-files`
  as the directory named by its
  [`secure_file_priv`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_secure_file_priv) system
  variable.

To export tables from the export server, use this procedure:

1. Ensure a consistent snapshot by executing this statement to
   lock the tables so that they cannot be modified during export:

   ```sql
   mysql> FLUSH TABLES hr.employees, hr.managers WITH READ LOCK;
   ```

   While the lock is in effect, the tables can still be used, but
   only for read access.
2. At the file system level, copy the `.sdi`
   and table content files from the `hr` schema
   directory to the secure export directory:

   - The `.sdi` file is located in the
     `hr` schema directory, but might not have
     exactly the same basename as the table name. For example,
     the `.sdi` files for the
     `employees` and
     `managers` tables might be named
     `employees_125.sdi` and
     `managers_238.sdi`.
   - For a `MyISAM` table, the content files
     are its `.MYD` data file and
     `.MYI` index file.

   Given those file names, the copy commands look like this:

   ```terminal
   $> cd export_basedir/data/hr
   $> cp employees_125.sdi /tmp/export
   $> cp managers_238.sdi /tmp/export
   $> cp employees.{MYD,MYI} /tmp/export
   $> cp managers.{MYD,MYI} /tmp/export
   ```
3. Unlock the tables:

   ```sql
   mysql> UNLOCK TABLES;
   ```

To import tables into the import server, use this procedure:

1. The import schema must exist. If necessary, execute this
   statement to create it:

   ```sql
   mysql> CREATE SCHEMA hr;
   ```
2. At the file system level, copy the `.sdi`
   files to the import server
   [`secure_file_priv`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_secure_file_priv) directory,
   `/tmp/mysql-files`. Also, copy the table
   content files to the `hr` schema directory:

   ```terminal
   $> cd /tmp/export
   $> cp employees_125.sdi /tmp/mysql-files
   $> cp managers_238.sdi /tmp/mysql-files
   $> cp employees.{MYD,MYI} import_basedir/data/hr
   $> cp managers.{MYD,MYI} import_basedir/data/hr
   ```
3. Import the tables by executing an [`IMPORT
   TABLE`](import-table.md "15.2.6 IMPORT TABLE Statement") statement that names the
   `.sdi` files:

   ```sql
   mysql> IMPORT TABLE FROM
          '/tmp/mysql-files/employees.sdi',
          '/tmp/mysql-files/managers.sdi';
   ```

The `.sdi` file need not be placed in the
import server directory named by the
[`secure_file_priv`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_secure_file_priv) system variable
if that variable is empty; it can be in any directory accessible
to the server, including the schema directory for the imported
table. If the `.sdi` file is placed in that
directory, however, it may be rewritten; the import operation
creates a new `.sdi` file for the table, which
overwrites the old `.sdi` file if the operation
uses the same file name for the new file.

Each *`sdi_file`* value must be a string
literal that names the `.sdi` file for a table
or is a pattern that matches `.sdi` files. If
the string is a pattern, any leading directory path and the
`.sdi` file name suffix must be given
literally. Pattern characters are permitted only in the base name
part of the file name:

- `?` matches any single character
- `*` matches any sequence of characters,
  including no characters

Using a pattern, the previous [`IMPORT
TABLE`](import-table.md "15.2.6 IMPORT TABLE Statement") statement could have been written like this
(assuming that the `/tmp/mysql-files` directory
contains no other `.sdi` files matching the
pattern):

```sql
IMPORT TABLE FROM '/tmp/mysql-files/*.sdi';
```

To interpret the location of `.sdi` file path
names, the server uses the same rules for
[`IMPORT TABLE`](import-table.md "15.2.6 IMPORT TABLE Statement") as the server-side
rules for [`LOAD DATA`](load-data.md "15.2.9 LOAD DATA Statement") (that is, the
non-`LOCAL` rules). See
[Section 15.2.9, “LOAD DATA Statement”](load-data.md "15.2.9 LOAD DATA Statement"), paying particular attention to the
rules used to interpret relative path names.

[`IMPORT TABLE`](import-table.md "15.2.6 IMPORT TABLE Statement") fails if the
`.sdi` or table files cannot be located. After
importing a table, the server attempts to open it and reports as
warnings any problems detected. To attempt a repair to correct any
reported issues, use [`REPAIR TABLE`](repair-table.md "15.7.3.5 REPAIR TABLE Statement").

[`IMPORT TABLE`](import-table.md "15.2.6 IMPORT TABLE Statement") is not written to the
binary log.

#### Restrictions and Limitations

[`IMPORT TABLE`](import-table.md "15.2.6 IMPORT TABLE Statement") applies only to
non-`TEMPORARY` `MyISAM`
tables. It does not apply to tables created with a transactional
storage engine, tables created with
[`CREATE TEMPORARY
TABLE`](create-table.md "15.1.20 CREATE TABLE Statement"), or views.

An `.sdi` file used in an import operation
must be generated on a server with the same data dictionary
version and sdi version as the import server. The version
information of the generating server is found in the
`.sdi` file:

```json
{
   "mysqld_version_id":80019,
   "dd_version":80017,
   "sdi_version":80016,
   ...
}
```

To determine the data dictionary and sdi version of the import
server, you can check the `.sdi` file of a
recently created table on the import server.

The table data and index files must be placed in the schema
directory for the import server prior to the import operation,
unless the table as defined on the export server uses the
`DATA DIRECTORY` or `INDEX
DIRECTORY` table options. In that case, modify the
import procedure using one of these alternatives before
executing the [`IMPORT TABLE`](import-table.md "15.2.6 IMPORT TABLE Statement")
statement:

- Put the data and index files into the same directory on the
  import server host as on the export server host, and create
  symlinks in the import server schema directory to those
  files.
- Put the data and index files into an import server host
  directory different from that on the export server host, and
  create symlinks in the import server schema directory to
  those files. In addition, modify the
  `.sdi` file to reflect the different file
  locations.
- Put the data and index files into the schema directory on
  the import server host, and modify the
  `.sdi` file to remove the data and index
  directory table options.

Any collation IDs stored in the `.sdi` file
must refer to the same collations on the export and import
servers.

Trigger information for a table is not serialized into the table
`.sdi` file, so triggers are not restored by
the import operation.

Some edits to an `.sdi` file are permissible
prior to executing the [`IMPORT
TABLE`](import-table.md "15.2.6 IMPORT TABLE Statement") statement, whereas others are problematic or may
even cause the import operation to fail:

- Changing the data directory and index directory table
  options is required if the locations of the data and index
  files differ between the export and import servers.
- Changing the schema name is required to import the table
  into a different schema on the import server than on the
  export server.
- Changing schema and table names may be required to
  accommodate differences between file system case-sensitivity
  semantics on the export and import servers or differences in
  [`lower_case_table_names`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_lower_case_table_names)
  settings. Changing the table names in the
  `.sdi` file may require renaming the
  table files as well.
- In some cases, changes to column definitions are permitted.
  Changing data types is likely to cause problems.
