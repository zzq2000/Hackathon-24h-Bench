## 29.20 Restrictions on Performance Schema

The Performance Schema avoids using mutexes to collect or produce
data, so there are no guarantees of consistency and results can
sometimes be incorrect. Event values in
`performance_schema` tables are nondeterministic
and nonrepeatable.

If you save event information in another table, you should not
assume that the original events remain available later. For
example, if you select events from a
`performance_schema` table into a temporary
table, intending to join that table with the original table later,
there might be no matches.

[**mysqldump**](mysqldump.md "6.5.4 mysqldump — A Database Backup Program") and `BACKUP
DATABASE` ignore tables in the
`performance_schema` database.

Tables in the `performance_schema` database
cannot be locked with `LOCK TABLES`, except the
`setup_xxx` tables.

Tables in the `performance_schema` database
cannot be indexed.

Tables in the `performance_schema` database are
not replicated.

The types of timers might vary per platform. The
[`performance_timers`](performance-schema-performance-timers-table.md "29.12.21.6 The performance_timers Table") table shows which
event timers are available. If the values in this table for a
given timer name are `NULL`, that timer is not
supported on your platform.

Instruments that apply to storage engines might not be implemented
for all storage engines. Instrumentation of each third-party
engine is the responsibility of the engine maintainer.
