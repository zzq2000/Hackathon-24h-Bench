#### 1.6.2.4 '--' as the Start of a Comment

Standard SQL uses the C syntax `/* this is a comment
*/` for comments, and MySQL Server supports this
syntax as well. MySQL also support extensions to this syntax
that enable MySQL-specific SQL to be embedded in the comment;
see [Section 11.7, “Comments”](comments.md "11.7 Comments").

MySQL Server also uses `#` as the start
comment character. This is nonstandard.

Standard SQL also uses “`--`” as a
start-comment sequence. MySQL Server supports a variant of the
`--` comment style; the `--`
start-comment sequence is accepted as such, but must be
followed by a whitespace character such as a space or newline.
The space is intended to prevent problems with generated SQL
queries that use constructs such as the following, which
updates the balance to reflect a charge:

```sql
UPDATE account SET balance=balance-charge
WHERE account_id=user_id
```

Consider what happens when `charge` has a
negative value such as `-1`, which might be
the case when an amount is credited to the account. In this
case, the generated statement looks like this:

```sql
UPDATE account SET balance=balance--1
WHERE account_id=5752;
```

`balance--1` is valid standard SQL, but
`--` is interpreted as the start of a
comment, and part of the expression is discarded. The result
is a statement that has a completely different meaning than
intended:

```sql
UPDATE account SET balance=balance
WHERE account_id=5752;
```

This statement produces no change in value at all. To keep
this from happening, MySQL requires a whitespace character
following the `--` for it to be recognized as
a start-comment sequence in MySQL Server, so that an
expression such as `balance--1` is always
safe to use.
