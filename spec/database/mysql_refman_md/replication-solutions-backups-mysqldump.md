#### 19.4.1.1 Backing Up a Replica Using mysqldump

Using [**mysqldump**](mysqldump.md "6.5.4 mysqldump — A Database Backup Program") to create a copy of a
database enables you to capture all of the data in the database
in a format that enables the information to be imported into
another instance of MySQL Server (see
[Section 6.5.4, “mysqldump — A Database Backup Program”](mysqldump.md "6.5.4 mysqldump — A Database Backup Program")). Because the format of the
information is SQL statements, the file can easily be
distributed and applied to running servers in the event that you
need access to the data in an emergency. However, if the size of
your data set is very large, [**mysqldump**](mysqldump.md "6.5.4 mysqldump — A Database Backup Program") may be
impractical.

Tip

Consider using the [MySQL Shell dump utilities](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/mysql-shell/8.0/en/mysql-shell-utilities-dump-instance-schema.html), which provide parallel dumping with multiple threads, file compression, and progress information display, as well as cloud features such as Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Object Storage streaming, and MySQL HeatWave compatibility checks and modifications. Dumps can be easily imported into a MySQL Server instance or a MySQL HeatWave DB System using the [MySQL Shell load dump utilities](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/mysql-shell/8.0/en/mysql-shell-utilities-load-dump.html). Installation instructions for MySQL Shell can be found [here](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/mysql-shell/8.0/en/mysql-shell-install.html).

When using [**mysqldump**](mysqldump.md "6.5.4 mysqldump — A Database Backup Program"), you should stop
replication on the replica before starting the dump process to
ensure that the dump contains a consistent set of data:

1. Stop the replica from processing requests. You can stop
   replication completely on the replica using
   [**mysqladmin**](mysqladmin.md "6.5.2 mysqladmin — A MySQL Server Administration Program"):

   ```terminal
   $> mysqladmin stop-slave
   ```

   Alternatively, you can stop only the replication SQL thread
   to pause event execution:

   ```terminal
   $> mysql -e 'STOP SLAVE SQL_THREAD;'
   Or from MySQL 8.0.22:
   $> mysql -e 'STOP REPLICA SQL_THREAD;'
   ```

   This enables the replica to continue to receive data change
   events from the source's binary log and store them in the
   relay logs using the replication receiver thread, but
   prevents the replica from executing these events and
   changing its data. Within busy replication environments,
   permitting the replication receiver thread to run during
   backup may speed up the catch-up process when you restart
   the replication applier thread.
2. Run [**mysqldump**](mysqldump.md "6.5.4 mysqldump — A Database Backup Program") to dump your databases. You
   may either dump all databases or select databases to be
   dumped. For example, to dump all databases:

   ```terminal
   $> mysqldump --all-databases > fulldb.dump
   ```
3. Once the dump has completed, start replication again:

   ```terminal
   $> mysqladmin start-slave
   ```

In the preceding example, you may want to add login credentials
(user name, password) to the commands, and bundle the process up
into a script that you can run automatically each day.

If you use this approach, make sure you monitor the replication
process to ensure that the time taken to run the backup does not
affect the replica's ability to keep up with events from the
source. See [Section 19.1.7.1, “Checking Replication Status”](replication-administration-status.md "19.1.7.1 Checking Replication Status").
If the replica is unable to keep up, you may want to add another
replica and distribute the backup process. For an example of how
to configure this scenario, see
[Section 19.4.6, “Replicating Different Databases to Different Replicas”](replication-solutions-partitioning.md "19.4.6 Replicating Different Databases to Different Replicas").
