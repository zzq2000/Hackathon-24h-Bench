#### 29.12.3.4 The rwlock\_instances Table

The [`rwlock_instances`](performance-schema-rwlock-instances-table.md "29.12.3.4 The rwlock_instances Table") table lists
all the [rwlock](glossary.md#glos_rw_lock "rw-lock") (read write
lock) instances seen by the Performance Schema while the
server executes. An `rwlock` is a
synchronization mechanism used in the code to enforce that
threads at a given time can have access to some common
resource following certain rules. The resource is said to be
“protected” by the `rwlock`. The
access is either shared (many threads can have a read lock at
the same time), exclusive (only one thread can have a write
lock at a given time), or shared-exclusive (a thread can have
a write lock while permitting inconsistent reads by other
threads). Shared-exclusive access is otherwise known as an
`sxlock` and optimizes concurrency and
improves scalability for read-write workloads.

Depending on how many threads are requesting a lock, and the
nature of the locks requested, access can be either granted in
shared mode, exclusive mode, shared-exclusive mode or not
granted at all, waiting for other threads to finish first.

The [`rwlock_instances`](performance-schema-rwlock-instances-table.md "29.12.3.4 The rwlock_instances Table") table has
these columns:

- `NAME`

  The instrument name associated with the lock.
- `OBJECT_INSTANCE_BEGIN`

  The address in memory of the instrumented lock.
- `WRITE_LOCKED_BY_THREAD_ID`

  When a thread currently has an `rwlock`
  locked in exclusive (write) mode,
  `WRITE_LOCKED_BY_THREAD_ID` is the
  `THREAD_ID` of the locking thread,
  otherwise it is `NULL`.
- `READ_LOCKED_BY_COUNT`

  When a thread currently has an `rwlock`
  locked in shared (read) mode,
  `READ_LOCKED_BY_COUNT` is incremented by
  1. This is a counter only, so it cannot be used directly
  to find which thread holds a read lock, but it can be used
  to see whether there is a read contention on an
  `rwlock`, and see how many readers are
  currently active.

The [`rwlock_instances`](performance-schema-rwlock-instances-table.md "29.12.3.4 The rwlock_instances Table") table has
these indexes:

- Primary key on (`OBJECT_INSTANCE_BEGIN`)
- Index on (`NAME`)
- Index on (`WRITE_LOCKED_BY_THREAD_ID`)

[`TRUNCATE TABLE`](truncate-table.md "15.1.37 TRUNCATE TABLE Statement") is not permitted
for the [`rwlock_instances`](performance-schema-rwlock-instances-table.md "29.12.3.4 The rwlock_instances Table") table.

By performing queries on both of the following tables, a
monitoring application or a DBA may detect some bottlenecks or
deadlocks between threads that involve locks:

- [`events_waits_current`](performance-schema-events-waits-current-table.md "29.12.4.1 The events_waits_current Table"), to see
  what `rwlock` a thread is waiting for
- [`rwlock_instances`](performance-schema-rwlock-instances-table.md "29.12.3.4 The rwlock_instances Table"), to see
  which other thread currently owns an
  `rwlock`

There is a limitation: The
[`rwlock_instances`](performance-schema-rwlock-instances-table.md "29.12.3.4 The rwlock_instances Table") can be used only
to identify the thread holding a write lock, but not the
threads holding a read lock.
