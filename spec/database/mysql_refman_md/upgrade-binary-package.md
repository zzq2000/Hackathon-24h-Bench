## 3.7 Upgrading MySQL Binary or Package-based Installations on Unix/Linux

This section describes how to upgrade MySQL binary and
package-based installations on Unix/Linux. In-place and logical
upgrade methods are described.

- [In-Place Upgrade](upgrade-binary-package.md#upgrade-procedure-inplace "In-Place Upgrade")
- [Logical Upgrade](upgrade-binary-package.md#upgrade-procedure-logical "Logical Upgrade")
- [MySQL Cluster Upgrade](upgrade-binary-package.md#upgrading-cluster "MySQL Cluster Upgrade")

### In-Place Upgrade

An in-place upgrade involves shutting down the old MySQL server,
replacing the old MySQL binaries or packages with the new ones,
restarting MySQL on the existing data directory, and upgrading
any remaining parts of the existing installation that require
upgrading. For details about what may need upgrading, see
[Section 3.4, “What the MySQL Upgrade Process Upgrades”](upgrading-what-is-upgraded.md "3.4 What the MySQL Upgrade Process Upgrades").

Note

If you are upgrading an installation originally produced by
installing multiple RPM packages, upgrade all the packages,
not just some. For example, if you previously installed the
server and client RPMs, do not upgrade just the server RPM.

For some Linux platforms, MySQL installation from RPM or
Debian packages includes systemd support for managing MySQL
server startup and shutdown. On these platforms,
[**mysqld\_safe**](mysqld-safe.md "6.3.2 mysqld_safe — MySQL Server Startup Script") is not installed. In such
cases, use systemd for server startup and shutdown instead of
the methods used in the following instructions. See
[Section 2.5.9, “Managing MySQL Server with systemd”](using-systemd.md "2.5.9 Managing MySQL Server with systemd").

For upgrades to MySQL Cluster installations, see also
[MySQL Cluster Upgrade](upgrade-binary-package.md#upgrading-cluster "MySQL Cluster Upgrade").

To perform an in-place upgrade:

1. Review the information in
   [Section 3.1, “Before You Begin”](upgrade-before-you-begin.md "3.1 Before You Begin").
2. Ensure the upgrade readiness of your installation by
   completing the preliminary checks in
   [Section 3.6, “Preparing Your Installation for Upgrade”](upgrade-prerequisites.md "3.6 Preparing Your Installation for Upgrade").
3. If you use XA transactions with `InnoDB`,
   run [`XA
   RECOVER`](xa-statements.md "15.3.8.1 XA Transaction SQL Statements") before upgrading to check for uncommitted
   XA transactions. If results are returned, either commit or
   rollback the XA transactions by issuing an
   [`XA
   COMMIT`](xa-statements.md "15.3.8.1 XA Transaction SQL Statements") or
   [`XA
   ROLLBACK`](xa-statements.md "15.3.8.1 XA Transaction SQL Statements") statement.
4. If you are upgrading from MySQL 5.7.11 or earlier to MySQL
   8.0, and there are encrypted
   `InnoDB` tablespaces, rotate the keyring
   master key by executing this statement:

   ```sql
   ALTER INSTANCE ROTATE INNODB MASTER KEY;
   ```
5. If you normally run your MySQL server configured with
   [`innodb_fast_shutdown`](innodb-parameters.md#sysvar_innodb_fast_shutdown) set to
   `2` (cold shutdown), configure it to
   perform a fast or slow shutdown by executing either of these
   statements:

   ```sql
   SET GLOBAL innodb_fast_shutdown = 1; -- fast shutdown
   SET GLOBAL innodb_fast_shutdown = 0; -- slow shutdown
   ```

   With a fast or slow shutdown, `InnoDB`
   leaves its undo logs and data files in a state that can be
   dealt with in case of file format differences between
   releases.
6. Shut down the old MySQL server. For example:

   ```terminal
   mysqladmin -u root -p shutdown
   ```
7. Upgrade the MySQL binaries or packages. If upgrading a
   binary installation, unpack the new MySQL binary
   distribution package. See
   [Obtain and Unpack the Distribution](binary-installation.md#binary-installation-unpack "Obtain and Unpack the Distribution"). For
   package-based installations, install the new packages.
8. Start the MySQL 8.0 server, using the existing
   data directory. For example:

   ```terminal
   mysqld_safe --user=mysql --datadir=/path/to/existing-datadir &
   ```

   If there are encrypted `InnoDB`
   tablespaces, use the
   [`--early-plugin-load`](server-options.md#option_mysqld_early-plugin-load) option to
   load the keyring plugin.

   When you start the MySQL 8.0 server, it
   automatically detects whether data dictionary tables are
   present. If not, the server creates them in the data
   directory, populates them with metadata, and then proceeds
   with its normal startup sequence. During this process, the
   server upgrades metadata for all database objects, including
   databases, tablespaces, system and user tables, views, and
   stored programs (stored procedures and functions, triggers,
   and Event Scheduler events). The server also removes files
   that previously were used for metadata storage. For example,
   after upgrading from MySQL 5.7 to MySQL
   8.0, you may notice that tables no longer have
   `.frm` files.

   If this step fails, the server reverts all changes to the
   data directory. In this case, you should remove all redo log
   files, start your MySQL 5.7 server on the same
   data directory, and fix the cause of any errors. Then
   perform another slow shutdown of the 5.7
   server and start the MySQL 8.0 server to try
   again.
9. In the previous step, the server upgrades the data
   dictionary as necessary. Now it is necessary to perform any
   remaining upgrade operations:

   - As of MySQL 8.0.16, the server does so as part of the
     previous step, making any changes required in the
     `mysql` system database between MySQL
     5.7 and MySQL 8.0, so that
     you can take advantage of new privileges or
     capabilities. It also brings the Performance Schema,
     `INFORMATION_SCHEMA`, and
     `sys` databases up to date for MySQL
     8.0, and examines all user databases for
     incompatibilities with the current version of MySQL.
   - Prior to MySQL 8.0.16, the server upgrades only the data
     dictionary in the previous step. After the MySQL
     8.0 server starts successfully, execute
     [**mysql\_upgrade**](mysql-upgrade.md "6.4.5 mysql_upgrade — Check and Upgrade MySQL Tables") to perform the
     remaining upgrade tasks:

     ```terminal
     mysql_upgrade -u root -p
     ```

     Then shut down and restart the MySQL server to ensure
     that any changes made to the system tables take effect.
     For example:

     ```terminal
     mysqladmin -u root -p shutdown
     mysqld_safe --user=mysql --datadir=/path/to/existing-datadir &
     ```

     The first time you start the MySQL 8.0
     server (in an earlier step), you may notice messages in
     the error log regarding nonupgraded tables. If
     [**mysql\_upgrade**](mysql-upgrade.md "6.4.5 mysql_upgrade — Check and Upgrade MySQL Tables") has been run
     successfully, there should be no such messages the
     second time you start the server.

Note

The upgrade process does not upgrade the contents of the time
zone tables. For upgrade instructions, see
[Section 7.1.15, “MySQL Server Time Zone Support”](time-zone-support.md "7.1.15 MySQL Server Time Zone Support").

If the upgrade process uses [**mysql\_upgrade**](mysql-upgrade.md "6.4.5 mysql_upgrade — Check and Upgrade MySQL Tables")
(that is, prior to MySQL 8.0.16), the process does not upgrade
the contents of the help tables, either. For upgrade
instructions in that case, see
[Section 7.1.17, “Server-Side Help Support”](server-side-help-support.md "7.1.17 Server-Side Help Support").

### Logical Upgrade

A logical upgrade involves exporting SQL from the old MySQL
instance using a backup or export utility such as
[**mysqldump**](mysqldump.md "6.5.4 mysqldump — A Database Backup Program") or [**mysqlpump**](mysqlpump.md "6.5.6 mysqlpump — A Database Backup Program"),
installing the new MySQL server, and applying the SQL to your
new MySQL instance. For details about what may need upgrading,
see [Section 3.4, “What the MySQL Upgrade Process Upgrades”](upgrading-what-is-upgraded.md "3.4 What the MySQL Upgrade Process Upgrades").

Note

For some Linux platforms, MySQL installation from RPM or
Debian packages includes systemd support for managing MySQL
server startup and shutdown. On these platforms,
[**mysqld\_safe**](mysqld-safe.md "6.3.2 mysqld_safe — MySQL Server Startup Script") is not installed. In such
cases, use systemd for server startup and shutdown instead of
the methods used in the following instructions. See
[Section 2.5.9, “Managing MySQL Server with systemd”](using-systemd.md "2.5.9 Managing MySQL Server with systemd").

Warning

Applying SQL extracted from a previous MySQL release to a new
MySQL release may result in errors due to incompatibilities
introduced by new, changed, deprecated, or removed features
and capabilities. Consequently, SQL extracted from a previous
MySQL release may require modification to enable a logical
upgrade.

To identify incompatibilities before upgrading to the latest
MySQL 8.0 release, perform the steps described in
[Section 3.6, “Preparing Your Installation for Upgrade”](upgrade-prerequisites.md "3.6 Preparing Your Installation for Upgrade").

To perform a logical upgrade:

1. Review the information in
   [Section 3.1, “Before You Begin”](upgrade-before-you-begin.md "3.1 Before You Begin").
2. Export your existing data from the previous MySQL
   installation:

   ```terminal
   mysqldump -u root -p
     --add-drop-table --routines --events
     --all-databases --force > data-for-upgrade.sql
   ```

   Note

   Use the [`--routines`](mysqldump.md#option_mysqldump_routines) and
   [`--events`](mysqldump.md#option_mysqldump_events) options with
   [**mysqldump**](mysqldump.md "6.5.4 mysqldump — A Database Backup Program") (as shown above) if your
   databases include stored programs. The
   [`--all-databases`](mysqldump.md#option_mysqldump_all-databases) option
   includes all databases in the dump, including the
   `mysql` database that holds the system
   tables.

   Important

   If you have tables that contain generated columns, use the
   [**mysqldump**](mysqldump.md "6.5.4 mysqldump — A Database Backup Program") utility provided with MySQL
   5.7.9 or higher to create your dump files. The
   [**mysqldump**](mysqldump.md "6.5.4 mysqldump — A Database Backup Program") utility provided in earlier
   releases uses incorrect syntax for generated column
   definitions (Bug #20769542). You can use the Information
   Schema [`COLUMNS`](information-schema-columns-table.md "28.3.8 The INFORMATION_SCHEMA COLUMNS Table") table to
   identify tables with generated columns.
3. Shut down the old MySQL server. For example:

   ```terminal
   mysqladmin -u root -p shutdown
   ```
4. Install MySQL 8.0. For installation
   instructions, see [Chapter 2, *Installing MySQL*](installing.md "Chapter 2 Installing MySQL").
5. Initialize a new data directory, as described in
   [Section 2.9.1, “Initializing the Data Directory”](data-directory-initialization.md "2.9.1 Initializing the Data Directory"). For
   example:

   ```terminal
   mysqld --initialize --datadir=/path/to/8.0-datadir
   ```

   Copy the temporary `'root'@'localhost'`
   password displayed to your screen or written to your error
   log for later use.
6. Start the MySQL 8.0 server, using the new data
   directory. For example:

   ```terminal
   mysqld_safe --user=mysql --datadir=/path/to/8.0-datadir &
   ```
7. Reset the `root` password:

   ```terminal
   $> mysql -u root -p
   Enter password: ****  <- enter temporary root password
   ```

   ```sql
   mysql> ALTER USER USER() IDENTIFIED BY 'your new password';
   ```
8. Load the previously created dump file into the new MySQL
   server. For example:

   ```terminal
   mysql -u root -p --force < data-for-upgrade.sql
   ```

   Note

   It is not recommended to load a dump file when GTIDs are
   enabled on the server
   ([`gtid_mode=ON`](replication-options-gtids.md#sysvar_gtid_mode)), if your
   dump file includes system tables.
   [**mysqldump**](mysqldump.md "6.5.4 mysqldump — A Database Backup Program") issues DML instructions for
   the system tables which use the non-transactional MyISAM
   storage engine, and this combination is not permitted when
   GTIDs are enabled. Also be aware that loading a dump file
   from a server with GTIDs enabled, into another server with
   GTIDs enabled, causes different transaction identifiers to
   be generated.
9. Perform any remaining upgrade operations:

   - In MySQL 8.0.16 and higher, shut down the server, then
     restart it with the
     [`--upgrade=FORCE`](server-options.md#option_mysqld_upgrade) option to
     perform the remaining upgrade tasks:

     ```terminal
     mysqladmin -u root -p shutdown
     mysqld_safe --user=mysql --datadir=/path/to/8.0-datadir --upgrade=FORCE &
     ```

     Upon restart with
     [`--upgrade=FORCE`](server-options.md#option_mysqld_upgrade), the
     server makes any changes required in the
     `mysql` system schema between MySQL
     5.7 and MySQL 8.0, so that
     you can take advantage of new privileges or
     capabilities. It also brings the Performance Schema,
     `INFORMATION_SCHEMA`, and
     `sys` schema up to date for MySQL
     8.0, and examines all user schemas for
     incompatibilities with the current version of MySQL.
   - Prior to MySQL 8.0.16, execute
     [**mysql\_upgrade**](mysql-upgrade.md "6.4.5 mysql_upgrade — Check and Upgrade MySQL Tables") to perform the
     remaining upgrade tasks:

     ```terminal
     mysql_upgrade -u root -p
     ```

     Then shut down and restart the MySQL server to ensure
     that any changes made to the system tables take effect.
     For example:

     ```terminal
     mysqladmin -u root -p shutdown
     mysqld_safe --user=mysql --datadir=/path/to/8.0-datadir &
     ```

Note

The upgrade process does not upgrade the contents of the time
zone tables. For upgrade instructions, see
[Section 7.1.15, “MySQL Server Time Zone Support”](time-zone-support.md "7.1.15 MySQL Server Time Zone Support").

If the upgrade process uses [**mysql\_upgrade**](mysql-upgrade.md "6.4.5 mysql_upgrade — Check and Upgrade MySQL Tables")
(that is, prior to MySQL 8.0.16), the process does not upgrade
the contents of the help tables, either. For upgrade
instructions in that case, see
[Section 7.1.17, “Server-Side Help Support”](server-side-help-support.md "7.1.17 Server-Side Help Support").

Note

Loading a dump file that contains a MySQL 5.7
`mysql` schema re-creates two tables that are
no longer used: `event` and
`proc`. (The corresponding MySQL 8.0 tables
are `events` and `routines`,
both of which are data dictionary tables and are protected.)
After you are satisfied that the upgrade was successful, you
can remove the `event` and
`proc` tables by executing these SQL
statements:

```sql
DROP TABLE mysql.event;
DROP TABLE mysql.proc;
```

### MySQL Cluster Upgrade

The information in this section is an adjunct to the in-place
upgrade procedure described in
[In-Place Upgrade](upgrade-binary-package.md#upgrade-procedure-inplace "In-Place Upgrade"), for use if you are
upgrading MySQL Cluster.

As of MySQL 8.0.16, a MySQL Cluster upgrade can be performed as
a regular rolling upgrade, following the usual three ordered
steps:

1. Upgrade MGM nodes.
2. Upgrade data nodes one at a time.
3. Upgrade API nodes one at a time (including MySQL servers).

The way to upgrade each of the nodes remains almost the same as
prior to MySQL 8.0.16 because there is a separation between
upgrading the data dictionary and upgrading the system tables.
There are two steps to upgrading each individual
`mysqld`:

1. Import the data dictionary.

   Start the new server with the
   [`--upgrade=MINIMAL`](server-options.md#option_mysqld_upgrade) option to
   upgrade the data dictionary but not the system tables. This
   is essentially the same as the pre-MySQL 8.0.16 action of
   starting the server and not invoking
   [**mysql\_upgrade**](mysql-upgrade.md "6.4.5 mysql_upgrade — Check and Upgrade MySQL Tables").

   The MySQL server must be connected to `NDB`
   for this phase to complete. If any `NDB` or
   `NDBINFO` tables exist, and the server
   cannot connect to the cluster, it exits with an error
   message:

   ```none
   Failed to Populate DD tables.
   ```
2. Upgrade the system tables.

   Prior to MySQL 8.0.16, the DBA invokes the
   [**mysql\_upgrade**](mysql-upgrade.md "6.4.5 mysql_upgrade — Check and Upgrade MySQL Tables") client to upgrade the
   system tables. As of MySQL 8.0.16, the server performs this
   action: To upgrade the system tables, restart each
   individual [**mysqld**](mysqld.md "6.3.1 mysqld — The MySQL Server") without the
   [`--upgrade=MINIMAL`](server-options.md#option_mysqld_upgrade) option.
