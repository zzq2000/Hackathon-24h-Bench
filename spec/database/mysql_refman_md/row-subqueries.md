#### 15.2.15.5 Row Subqueries

Scalar or column subqueries return a single value or a column of
values. A *row subquery* is a subquery
variant that returns a single row and can thus return more than
one column value. Legal operators for row subquery comparisons
are:

```sql
=  >  <  >=  <=  <>  !=  <=>
```

Here are two examples:

```sql
SELECT * FROM t1
  WHERE (col1,col2) = (SELECT col3, col4 FROM t2 WHERE id = 10);
SELECT * FROM t1
  WHERE ROW(col1,col2) = (SELECT col3, col4 FROM t2 WHERE id = 10);
```

For both queries, if the table `t2` contains a
single row with `id = 10`, the subquery returns
a single row. If this row has `col3` and
`col4` values equal to the
`col1` and `col2` values of
any rows in `t1`, the `WHERE`
expression is `TRUE` and each query returns
those `t1` rows. If the `t2`
row `col3` and `col4` values
are not equal the `col1` and
`col2` values of any `t1` row,
the expression is `FALSE` and the query returns
an empty result set. The expression is
*unknown* (that is, `NULL`)
if the subquery produces no rows. An error occurs if the
subquery produces multiple rows because a row subquery can
return at most one row.

For information about how each operator works for row
comparisons, see [Section 14.4.2, “Comparison Functions and Operators”](comparison-operators.md "14.4.2 Comparison Functions and Operators").

The expressions `(1,2)` and
`ROW(1,2)` are sometimes called
row constructors. The two
are equivalent. The row constructor and the row returned by the
subquery must contain the same number of values.

A row constructor is used for comparisons with subqueries that
return two or more columns. When a subquery returns a single
column, this is regarded as a scalar value and not as a row, so
a row constructor cannot be used with a subquery that does not
return at least two columns. Thus, the following query fails
with a syntax error:

```sql
SELECT * FROM t1 WHERE ROW(1) = (SELECT column1 FROM t2)
```

Row constructors are legal in other contexts. For example, the
following two statements are semantically equivalent (and are
handled in the same way by the optimizer):

```sql
SELECT * FROM t1 WHERE (column1,column2) = (1,1);
SELECT * FROM t1 WHERE column1 = 1 AND column2 = 1;
```

The following query answers the request, “find all rows in
table `t1` that also exist in table
`t2`”:

```sql
SELECT column1,column2,column3
  FROM t1
  WHERE (column1,column2,column3) IN
         (SELECT column1,column2,column3 FROM t2);
```
