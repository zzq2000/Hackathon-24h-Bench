### 26.3.1 Management of RANGE and LIST Partitions

Adding and dropping of range and list partitions are handled in
a similar fashion, so we discuss the management of both sorts of
partitioning in this section. For information about working with
tables that are partitioned by hash or key, see
[Section 26.3.2, “Management of HASH and KEY Partitions”](partitioning-management-hash-key.md "26.3.2 Management of HASH and KEY Partitions").

Dropping a partition from a table that is partitioned by either
`RANGE` or by `LIST` can be
accomplished using the
[`ALTER
TABLE`](alter-table-partition-operations.md "15.1.9.1 ALTER TABLE Partition Operations") statement with the `DROP
PARTITION` option. Suppose that you have created a
table that is partitioned by range and then populated with 10
records using the following [`CREATE
TABLE`](create-table.md "15.1.20 CREATE TABLE Statement") and [`INSERT`](insert.md "15.2.7 INSERT Statement")
statements:

```sql
mysql> CREATE TABLE tr (id INT, name VARCHAR(50), purchased DATE)
    ->     PARTITION BY RANGE( YEAR(purchased) ) (
    ->         PARTITION p0 VALUES LESS THAN (1990),
    ->         PARTITION p1 VALUES LESS THAN (1995),
    ->         PARTITION p2 VALUES LESS THAN (2000),
    ->         PARTITION p3 VALUES LESS THAN (2005),
    ->         PARTITION p4 VALUES LESS THAN (2010),
    ->         PARTITION p5 VALUES LESS THAN (2015)
    ->     );
Query OK, 0 rows affected (0.28 sec)

mysql> INSERT INTO tr VALUES
    ->     (1, 'desk organiser', '2003-10-15'),
    ->     (2, 'alarm clock', '1997-11-05'),
    ->     (3, 'chair', '2009-03-10'),
    ->     (4, 'bookcase', '1989-01-10'),
    ->     (5, 'exercise bike', '2014-05-09'),
    ->     (6, 'sofa', '1987-06-05'),
    ->     (7, 'espresso maker', '2011-11-22'),
    ->     (8, 'aquarium', '1992-08-04'),
    ->     (9, 'study desk', '2006-09-16'),
    ->     (10, 'lava lamp', '1998-12-25');
Query OK, 10 rows affected (0.05 sec)
Records: 10  Duplicates: 0  Warnings: 0
```

You can see which items should have been inserted into partition
`p2` as shown here:

```sql
mysql> SELECT * FROM tr
    ->     WHERE purchased BETWEEN '1995-01-01' AND '1999-12-31';
+------+-------------+------------+
| id   | name        | purchased  |
+------+-------------+------------+
|    2 | alarm clock | 1997-11-05 |
|   10 | lava lamp   | 1998-12-25 |
+------+-------------+------------+
2 rows in set (0.00 sec)
```

You can also get this information using partition selection, as
shown here:

```sql
mysql> SELECT * FROM tr PARTITION (p2);
+------+-------------+------------+
| id   | name        | purchased  |
+------+-------------+------------+
|    2 | alarm clock | 1997-11-05 |
|   10 | lava lamp   | 1998-12-25 |
+------+-------------+------------+
2 rows in set (0.00 sec)
```

See [Section 26.5, “Partition Selection”](partitioning-selection.md "26.5 Partition Selection"), for more
information.

To drop the partition named `p2`, execute the
following command:

```sql
mysql> ALTER TABLE tr DROP PARTITION p2;
Query OK, 0 rows affected (0.03 sec)
```

Note

The [`NDBCLUSTER`](mysql-cluster.md "Chapter 25 MySQL NDB Cluster 8.0") storage engine
does not support `ALTER TABLE ... DROP
PARTITION`. It does, however, support the other
partitioning-related extensions to
[`ALTER
TABLE`](alter-table-partition-operations.md "15.1.9.1 ALTER TABLE Partition Operations") that are described in this chapter.

It is very important to remember that, *when you drop a
partition, you also delete all the data that was stored in that
partition*. You can see that this is the case by
re-running the previous [`SELECT`](select.md "15.2.13 SELECT Statement")
query:

```sql
mysql> SELECT * FROM tr WHERE purchased
    -> BETWEEN '1995-01-01' AND '1999-12-31';
Empty set (0.00 sec)
```

Note

`DROP PARTITION` is supported by native
partitioning in-place APIs and may be used with
`ALGORITHM={COPY|INPLACE}`. `DROP
PARTITION` with `ALGORITHM=INPLACE`
deletes data stored in the partition and drops the partition.
However, `DROP PARTITION` with
`ALGORITHM=COPY` or
[`old_alter_table=ON`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_old_alter_table) rebuilds
the partitioned table and attempts to move data from the
dropped partition to another partition with a compatible
`PARTITION ... VALUES` definition. Data that
cannot be moved to another partition is deleted.

Because of this, you must have the
[`DROP`](privileges-provided.md#priv_drop) privilege for a table before
you can execute `ALTER TABLE ... DROP
PARTITION` on that table.

If you wish to drop all data from all partitions while
preserving the table definition and its partitioning scheme, use
the [`TRUNCATE TABLE`](truncate-table.md "15.1.37 TRUNCATE TABLE Statement") statement.
(See [Section 15.1.37, “TRUNCATE TABLE Statement”](truncate-table.md "15.1.37 TRUNCATE TABLE Statement").)

If you intend to change the partitioning of a table
*without* losing data, use `ALTER
TABLE ... REORGANIZE PARTITION` instead. See below or
in [Section 15.1.9, “ALTER TABLE Statement”](alter-table.md "15.1.9 ALTER TABLE Statement"), for information about
`REORGANIZE PARTITION`.

If you now execute a [`SHOW CREATE
TABLE`](show-create-table.md "15.7.7.10 SHOW CREATE TABLE Statement") statement, you can see how the partitioning
makeup of the table has been changed:

```sql
mysql> SHOW CREATE TABLE tr\G
*************************** 1. row ***************************
       Table: tr
Create Table: CREATE TABLE `tr` (
  `id` int(11) DEFAULT NULL,
  `name` varchar(50) DEFAULT NULL,
  `purchased` date DEFAULT NULL
) ENGINE=InnoDB DEFAULT CHARSET=utf8mb4 COLLATE=utf8mb4_0900_ai_ci
/*!50100 PARTITION BY RANGE ( YEAR(purchased))
(PARTITION p0 VALUES LESS THAN (1990) ENGINE = InnoDB,
 PARTITION p1 VALUES LESS THAN (1995) ENGINE = InnoDB,
 PARTITION p3 VALUES LESS THAN (2005) ENGINE = InnoDB,
 PARTITION p4 VALUES LESS THAN (2010) ENGINE = InnoDB,
 PARTITION p5 VALUES LESS THAN (2015) ENGINE = InnoDB) */
1 row in set (0.00 sec)
```

When you insert new rows into the changed table with
`purchased` column values between
`'1995-01-01'` and
`'2004-12-31'` inclusive, those rows are stored
in partition `p3`. You can verify this as
follows:

```sql
mysql> INSERT INTO tr VALUES (11, 'pencil holder', '1995-07-12');
Query OK, 1 row affected (0.00 sec)

mysql> SELECT * FROM tr WHERE purchased
    -> BETWEEN '1995-01-01' AND '2004-12-31';
+------+----------------+------------+
| id   | name           | purchased  |
+------+----------------+------------+
|    1 | desk organiser | 2003-10-15 |
|   11 | pencil holder  | 1995-07-12 |
+------+----------------+------------+
2 rows in set (0.00 sec)

mysql> ALTER TABLE tr DROP PARTITION p3;
Query OK, 0 rows affected (0.03 sec)

mysql> SELECT * FROM tr WHERE purchased
    -> BETWEEN '1995-01-01' AND '2004-12-31';
Empty set (0.00 sec)
```

The number of rows dropped from the table as a result of
`ALTER TABLE ... DROP PARTITION` is not
reported by the server as it would be by the equivalent
[`DELETE`](delete.md "15.2.2 DELETE Statement") query.

Dropping `LIST` partitions uses exactly the
same `ALTER TABLE ... DROP PARTITION` syntax as
used for dropping `RANGE` partitions. However,
there is one important difference in the effect this has on your
use of the table afterward: You can no longer insert into the
table any rows having any of the values that were included in
the value list defining the deleted partition. (See
[Section 26.2.2, “LIST Partitioning”](partitioning-list.md "26.2.2 LIST Partitioning"), for an example.)

To add a new range or list partition to a previously partitioned
table, use the `ALTER TABLE ... ADD PARTITION`
statement. For tables which are partitioned by
`RANGE`, this can be used to add a new range to
the end of the list of existing partitions. Suppose that you
have a partitioned table containing membership data for your
organization, which is defined as follows:

```sql
CREATE TABLE members (
    id INT,
    fname VARCHAR(25),
    lname VARCHAR(25),
    dob DATE
)
PARTITION BY RANGE( YEAR(dob) ) (
    PARTITION p0 VALUES LESS THAN (1980),
    PARTITION p1 VALUES LESS THAN (1990),
    PARTITION p2 VALUES LESS THAN (2000)
);
```

Suppose further that the minimum age for members is 16. As the
calendar approaches the end of 2015, you realize that you must
soon be prepared to admit members who were born in 2000 (and
later). You can modify the `members` table to
accommodate new members born in the years 2000 to 2010 as shown
here:

```sql
ALTER TABLE members ADD PARTITION (PARTITION p3 VALUES LESS THAN (2010));
```

With tables that are partitioned by range, you can use
`ADD PARTITION` to add new partitions to the
high end of the partitions list only. Trying to add a new
partition in this manner between or before existing partitions
results in an error as shown here:

```sql
mysql> ALTER TABLE members
     >     ADD PARTITION (
     >     PARTITION n VALUES LESS THAN (1970));
ERROR 1463 (HY000): VALUES LESS THAN value must be strictly »
   increasing for each partition
```

You can work around this problem by reorganizing the first
partition into two new ones that split the range between them,
like this:

```sql
ALTER TABLE members
    REORGANIZE PARTITION p0 INTO (
        PARTITION n0 VALUES LESS THAN (1970),
        PARTITION n1 VALUES LESS THAN (1980)
);
```

Using [`SHOW CREATE TABLE`](show-create-table.md "15.7.7.10 SHOW CREATE TABLE Statement") you can
see that the `ALTER TABLE` statement has had
the desired effect:

```sql
mysql> SHOW CREATE TABLE members\G
*************************** 1. row ***************************
       Table: members
Create Table: CREATE TABLE `members` (
  `id` int(11) DEFAULT NULL,
  `fname` varchar(25) DEFAULT NULL,
  `lname` varchar(25) DEFAULT NULL,
  `dob` date DEFAULT NULL
) ENGINE=InnoDB DEFAULT CHARSET=utf8mb4 COLLATE=utf8mb4_0900_ai_ci
/*!50100 PARTITION BY RANGE ( YEAR(dob))
(PARTITION n0 VALUES LESS THAN (1970) ENGINE = InnoDB,
 PARTITION n1 VALUES LESS THAN (1980) ENGINE = InnoDB,
 PARTITION p1 VALUES LESS THAN (1990) ENGINE = InnoDB,
 PARTITION p2 VALUES LESS THAN (2000) ENGINE = InnoDB,
 PARTITION p3 VALUES LESS THAN (2010) ENGINE = InnoDB) */
1 row in set (0.00 sec)
```

See also [Section 15.1.9.1, “ALTER TABLE Partition Operations”](alter-table-partition-operations.md "15.1.9.1 ALTER TABLE Partition Operations").

You can also use `ALTER TABLE ... ADD
PARTITION` to add new partitions to a table that is
partitioned by `LIST`. Suppose a table
`tt` is defined using the following
[`CREATE TABLE`](create-table.md "15.1.20 CREATE TABLE Statement") statement:

```sql
CREATE TABLE tt (
    id INT,
    data INT
)
PARTITION BY LIST(data) (
    PARTITION p0 VALUES IN (5, 10, 15),
    PARTITION p1 VALUES IN (6, 12, 18)
);
```

You can add a new partition in which to store rows having the
`data` column values `7`,
`14`, and `21` as shown:

```sql
ALTER TABLE tt ADD PARTITION (PARTITION p2 VALUES IN (7, 14, 21));
```

Keep in mind that you *cannot* add a new
`LIST` partition encompassing any values that
are already included in the value list of an existing partition.
If you attempt to do so, an error results:

```sql
mysql> ALTER TABLE tt ADD PARTITION
     >     (PARTITION np VALUES IN (4, 8, 12));
ERROR 1465 (HY000): Multiple definition of same constant »
                    in list partitioning
```

Because any rows with the `data` column value
`12` have already been assigned to partition
`p1`, you cannot create a new partition on
table `tt` that includes `12`
in its value list. To accomplish this, you could drop
`p1`, and add `np` and then a
new `p1` with a modified definition. However,
as discussed earlier, this would result in the loss of all data
stored in `p1`—and it is often the case
that this is not what you really want to do. Another solution
might appear to be to make a copy of the table with the new
partitioning and to copy the data into it using
[`CREATE TABLE ...
SELECT ...`](create-table.md "15.1.20 CREATE TABLE Statement"), then drop the old table and rename the new
one, but this could be very time-consuming when dealing with a
large amounts of data. This also might not be feasible in
situations where high availability is a requirement.

You can add multiple partitions in a single `ALTER TABLE
... ADD PARTITION` statement as shown here:

```sql
CREATE TABLE employees (
  id INT NOT NULL,
  fname VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
  lname VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
  hired DATE NOT NULL
)
PARTITION BY RANGE( YEAR(hired) ) (
  PARTITION p1 VALUES LESS THAN (1991),
  PARTITION p2 VALUES LESS THAN (1996),
  PARTITION p3 VALUES LESS THAN (2001),
  PARTITION p4 VALUES LESS THAN (2005)
);

ALTER TABLE employees ADD PARTITION (
    PARTITION p5 VALUES LESS THAN (2010),
    PARTITION p6 VALUES LESS THAN MAXVALUE
);
```

Fortunately, MySQL's partitioning implementation provides ways
to redefine partitions without losing data. Let us look first at
a couple of simple examples involving `RANGE`
partitioning. Recall the `members` table which
is now defined as shown here:

```sql
mysql> SHOW CREATE TABLE members\G
*************************** 1. row ***************************
       Table: members
Create Table: CREATE TABLE `members` (
  `id` int(11) DEFAULT NULL,
  `fname` varchar(25) DEFAULT NULL,
  `lname` varchar(25) DEFAULT NULL,
  `dob` date DEFAULT NULL
) ENGINE=InnoDB DEFAULT CHARSET=utf8mb4 COLLATE=utf8mb4_0900_ai_ci
/*!50100 PARTITION BY RANGE ( YEAR(dob))
(PARTITION n0 VALUES LESS THAN (1970) ENGINE = InnoDB,
 PARTITION n1 VALUES LESS THAN (1980) ENGINE = InnoDB,
 PARTITION p1 VALUES LESS THAN (1990) ENGINE = InnoDB,
 PARTITION p2 VALUES LESS THAN (2000) ENGINE = InnoDB,
 PARTITION p3 VALUES LESS THAN (2010) ENGINE = InnoDB) */
1 row in set (0.00 sec)
```

Suppose that you would like to move all rows representing
members born before 1960 into a separate partition. As we have
already seen, this cannot be done using
[`ALTER
TABLE ... ADD PARTITION`](alter-table-partition-operations.md "15.1.9.1 ALTER TABLE Partition Operations"). However, you can use another
partition-related extension to
[`ALTER
TABLE`](alter-table-partition-operations.md "15.1.9.1 ALTER TABLE Partition Operations") to accomplish this:

```sql
ALTER TABLE members REORGANIZE PARTITION n0 INTO (
    PARTITION s0 VALUES LESS THAN (1960),
    PARTITION s1 VALUES LESS THAN (1970)
);
```

In effect, this command splits partition `n0`
into two new partitions `s0` and
`s1`. It also moves the data that was stored in
`n0` into the new partitions according to the
rules embodied in the two `PARTITION ... VALUES
...` clauses, so that `s0` contains
only those records for which
[`YEAR(dob)`](date-and-time-functions.md#function_year) is less than 1960 and
`s1` contains those rows in which
[`YEAR(dob)`](date-and-time-functions.md#function_year) is greater than or
equal to 1960 but less than 1970.

A `REORGANIZE PARTITION` clause may also be
used for merging adjacent partitions. You can reverse the effect
of the previous statement on the `members`
table as shown here:

```sql
ALTER TABLE members REORGANIZE PARTITION s0,s1 INTO (
    PARTITION p0 VALUES LESS THAN (1970)
);
```

No data is lost in splitting or merging partitions using
`REORGANIZE PARTITION`. In executing the above
statement, MySQL moves all of the records that were stored in
partitions `s0` and `s1` into
partition `p0`.

The general syntax for `REORGANIZE PARTITION`
is shown here:

```sql
ALTER TABLE tbl_name
    REORGANIZE PARTITION partition_list
    INTO (partition_definitions);
```

Here, *`tbl_name`* is the name of the
partitioned table, and *`partition_list`*
is a comma-separated list of names of one or more existing
partitions to be changed.
*`partition_definitions`* is a
comma-separated list of new partition definitions, which follow
the same rules as for the
*`partition_definitions`* list used in
[`CREATE TABLE`](create-table.md "15.1.20 CREATE TABLE Statement"). You are not limited
to merging several partitions into one, or to splitting one
partition into many, when using `REORGANIZE
PARTITION`. For example, you can reorganize all four
partitions of the `members` table into two,
like this:

```sql
ALTER TABLE members REORGANIZE PARTITION p0,p1,p2,p3 INTO (
    PARTITION m0 VALUES LESS THAN (1980),
    PARTITION m1 VALUES LESS THAN (2000)
);
```

You can also use `REORGANIZE PARTITION` with
tables that are partitioned by `LIST`. Let us
return to the problem of adding a new partition to the
list-partitioned `tt` table and failing because
the new partition had a value that was already present in the
value-list of one of the existing partitions. We can handle this
by adding a partition that contains only nonconflicting values,
and then reorganizing the new partition and the existing one so
that the value which was stored in the existing one is now moved
to the new one:

```sql
ALTER TABLE tt ADD PARTITION (PARTITION np VALUES IN (4, 8));
ALTER TABLE tt REORGANIZE PARTITION p1,np INTO (
    PARTITION p1 VALUES IN (6, 18),
    PARTITION np VALUES in (4, 8, 12)
);
```

Here are some key points to keep in mind when using
`ALTER TABLE ... REORGANIZE PARTITION` to
repartition tables that are partitioned by
`RANGE` or `LIST`:

- The `PARTITION` options used to determine
  the new partitioning scheme are subject to the same rules as
  those used with a [`CREATE
  TABLE`](create-table.md "15.1.20 CREATE TABLE Statement") statement.

  A new `RANGE` partitioning scheme cannot
  have any overlapping ranges; a new `LIST`
  partitioning scheme cannot have any overlapping sets of
  values.
- The combination of partitions in the
  *`partition_definitions`* list should
  account for the same range or set of values overall as the
  combined partitions named in the
  *`partition_list`*.

  For example, partitions `p1` and
  `p2` together cover the years 1980 through
  1999 in the `members` table used as an
  example in this section. Any reorganization of these two
  partitions should cover the same range of years overall.
- For tables partitioned by `RANGE`, you can
  reorganize only adjacent partitions; you cannot skip range
  partitions.

  For instance, you could not reorganize the example
  `members` table using a statement beginning
  with `ALTER TABLE members REORGANIZE PARTITION p0,p2
  INTO ...` because `p0` covers the
  years prior to 1970 and `p2` the years from
  1990 through 1999 inclusive, so these are not adjacent
  partitions. (You cannot skip partition `p1`
  in this case.)
- You cannot use `REORGANIZE PARTITION` to
  change the type of partitioning used by the table (for
  example, you cannot change `RANGE`
  partitions to `HASH` partitions or the
  reverse). You also cannot use this statement to change the
  partitioning expression or column. To accomplish either of
  these tasks without dropping and re-creating the table, you
  can use
  [`ALTER
  TABLE ... PARTITION BY ...`](alter-table-partition-operations.md "15.1.9.1 ALTER TABLE Partition Operations"), as shown here:

  ```sql
  ALTER TABLE members
      PARTITION BY HASH( YEAR(dob) )
      PARTITIONS 8;
  ```
