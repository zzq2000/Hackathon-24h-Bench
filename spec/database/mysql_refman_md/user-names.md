### 8.2.1 Account User Names and Passwords

MySQL stores accounts in the `user` table of the
`mysql` system database. An account is defined in
terms of a user name and the client host or hosts from which the
user can connect to the server. For information about account
representation in the `user` table, see
[Section 8.2.3, “Grant Tables”](grant-tables.md "8.2.3 Grant Tables").

An account may also have authentication credentials such as a
password. The credentials are handled by the account
authentication plugin. MySQL supports multiple authentication
plugins. Some of them use built-in authentication methods, whereas
others enable authentication using external authentication
methods. See [Section 8.2.17, “Pluggable Authentication”](pluggable-authentication.md "8.2.17 Pluggable Authentication").

There are several distinctions between the way user names and
passwords are used by MySQL and your operating system:

- User names, as used by MySQL for authentication purposes, have
  nothing to do with user names (login names) as used by Windows
  or Unix. On Unix, most MySQL clients by default try to log in
  using the current Unix user name as the MySQL user name, but
  that is for convenience only. The default can be overridden
  easily, because client programs permit any user name to be
  specified with a `-u` or
  `--user` option. This means that anyone can
  attempt to connect to the server using any user name, so you
  cannot make a database secure in any way unless all MySQL
  accounts have passwords. Anyone who specifies a user name for
  an account that has no password can connect successfully to
  the server.
- MySQL user names are up to 32 characters long. Operating
  system user names may have a different maximum length.

  Warning

  The MySQL user name length limit is hardcoded in MySQL
  servers and clients, and trying to circumvent it by
  modifying the definitions of the tables in the
  `mysql` database *does not
  work*.

  You should never alter the structure of tables in the
  `mysql` database in any manner whatsoever
  except by means of the procedure that is described in
  [Chapter 3, *Upgrading MySQL*](upgrading.md "Chapter 3 Upgrading MySQL"). Attempting to redefine the
  MySQL system tables in any other fashion results in
  undefined and unsupported behavior. The server is free to
  ignore rows that become malformed as a result of such
  modifications.
- To authenticate client connections for accounts that use
  built-in authentication methods, the server uses passwords
  stored in the `user` table. These passwords
  are distinct from passwords for logging in to your operating
  system. There is no necessary connection between the
  “external” password you use to log in to a
  Windows or Unix machine and the password you use to access the
  MySQL server on that machine.

  If the server authenticates a client using some other plugin,
  the authentication method that the plugin implements may or
  may not use a password stored in the `user`
  table. In this case, it is possible that an external password
  is also used to authenticate to the MySQL server.
- Passwords stored in the `user` table are
  encrypted using plugin-specific algorithms.
- If the user name and password contain only ASCII characters,
  it is possible to connect to the server regardless of
  character set settings. To enable connections when the user
  name or password contain non-ASCII characters, client
  applications should call the
  [`mysql_options()`](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/c-api/8.0/en/mysql-options.html) C API function
  with the `MYSQL_SET_CHARSET_NAME` option and
  appropriate character set name as arguments. This causes
  authentication to take place using the specified character
  set. Otherwise, authentication fails unless the server default
  character set is the same as the encoding in the
  authentication defaults.

  Standard MySQL client programs support a
  `--default-character-set` option that causes
  [`mysql_options()`](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/c-api/8.0/en/mysql-options.html) to be called
  as just described. In addition, character set autodetection is
  supported as described in
  [Section 12.4, “Connection Character Sets and Collations”](charset-connection.md "12.4 Connection Character Sets and Collations"). For programs that use a
  connector that is not based on the C API, the connector may
  provide an equivalent to
  [`mysql_options()`](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/c-api/8.0/en/mysql-options.html) that can be
  used instead. Check the connector documentation.

  The preceding notes do not apply for `ucs2`,
  `utf16`, and `utf32`, which
  are not permitted as client character sets.

The MySQL installation process populates the grant tables with an
initial `root` account, as described in
[Section 2.9.4, “Securing the Initial MySQL Account”](default-privileges.md "2.9.4 Securing the Initial MySQL Account"), which also discusses how to
assign a password to it. Thereafter, you normally set up, modify,
and remove MySQL accounts using statements such as
[`CREATE USER`](create-user.md "15.7.1.3 CREATE USER Statement"),
[`DROP USER`](drop-user.md "15.7.1.5 DROP USER Statement"),
[`GRANT`](grant.md "15.7.1.6 GRANT Statement"), and
[`REVOKE`](revoke.md "15.7.1.8 REVOKE Statement"). See
[Section 8.2.8, “Adding Accounts, Assigning Privileges, and Dropping Accounts”](creating-accounts.md "8.2.8 Adding Accounts, Assigning Privileges, and Dropping Accounts"), and
[Section 15.7.1, “Account Management Statements”](account-management-statements.md "15.7.1 Account Management Statements").

To connect to a MySQL server with a command-line client, specify
user name and password options as necessary for the account that
you want to use:

```terminal
$> mysql --user=finley --password db_name
```

If you prefer short options, the command looks like this:

```terminal
$> mysql -u finley -p db_name
```

If you omit the password value following the
[`--password`](connection-options.md#option_general_password) or `-p`
option on the command line (as just shown), the client prompts for
one. Alternatively, the password can be specified on the command
line:

```terminal
$> mysql --user=finley --password=password db_name
$> mysql -u finley -ppassword db_name
```

If you use the `-p` option, there must be
*no space* between `-p` and the
following password value.

Specifying a password on the command line should be considered
insecure. See [Section 8.1.2.1, “End-User Guidelines for Password Security”](password-security-user.md "8.1.2.1 End-User Guidelines for Password Security"). To avoid
giving the password on the command line, use an option file or a
login path file. See [Section 6.2.2.2, “Using Option Files”](option-files.md "6.2.2.2 Using Option Files"), and
[Section 6.6.7, “mysql\_config\_editor — MySQL Configuration Utility”](mysql-config-editor.md "6.6.7 mysql_config_editor — MySQL Configuration Utility").

For additional information about specifying user names, passwords,
and other connection parameters, see [Section 6.2.4, “Connecting to the MySQL Server Using Command Options”](connecting.md "6.2.4 Connecting to the MySQL Server Using Command Options").
