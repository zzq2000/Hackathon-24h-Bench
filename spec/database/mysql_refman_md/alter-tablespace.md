### 15.1.10 ALTER TABLESPACE Statement

```sql
ALTER [UNDO] TABLESPACE tablespace_name
  NDB only:
    {ADD | DROP} DATAFILE 'file_name'
    [INITIAL_SIZE [=] size]
    [WAIT]
  InnoDB and NDB:
    [RENAME TO tablespace_name]
  InnoDB only:
    [AUTOEXTEND_SIZE [=] 'value']
    [SET {ACTIVE | INACTIVE}]
    [ENCRYPTION [=] {'Y' | 'N'}]
  InnoDB and NDB:
    [ENGINE [=] engine_name]
  Reserved for future use:
    [ENGINE_ATTRIBUTE [=] 'string']
```

This statement is used with `NDB` and
`InnoDB` tablespaces. It can be used to add a new
data file to, or to drop a data file from an
`NDB` tablespace. It can also be used to rename
an NDB Cluster Disk Data tablespace, rename an
`InnoDB` general tablespace, encrypt an
`InnoDB` general tablespace, or mark an
`InnoDB` undo tablespace as active or inactive.

The `UNDO` keyword, introduced in MySQL 8.0.14,
is used with the `SET {ACTIVE | INACTIVE}` clause
to mark an `InnoDB` undo tablespace as active or
inactive. For more information, see
[Section 17.6.3.4, “Undo Tablespaces”](innodb-undo-tablespaces.md "17.6.3.4 Undo Tablespaces").

The `ADD DATAFILE` variant enables you to specify
an initial size for an `NDB` Disk Data tablespace
using an `INITIAL_SIZE` clause, where
*`size`* is measured in bytes; the default
value is 134217728 (128 MB). You may optionally follow
*`size`* with a one-letter abbreviation for
an order of magnitude, similar to those used in
`my.cnf`. Generally, this is one of the letters
`M` (megabytes) or `G`
(gigabytes).

On 32-bit systems, the maximum supported value for
`INITIAL_SIZE` is 4294967296 (4 GB). (Bug #29186)

`INITIAL_SIZE` is rounded, explicitly, as for
[`CREATE TABLESPACE`](create-tablespace.md "15.1.21 CREATE TABLESPACE Statement").

Once a data file has been created, its size cannot be changed;
however, you can add more data files to an NDB tablespace using
additional `ALTER TABLESPACE ... ADD DATAFILE`
statements.

When `ALTER TABLESPACE ... ADD DATAFILE` is used
with `ENGINE = NDB`, a data file is created on
each Cluster data node, but only one row is generated in the
Information Schema [`FILES`](information-schema-files-table.md "28.3.15 The INFORMATION_SCHEMA FILES Table") table. See
the description of this table, as well as
[Section 25.6.11.1, “NDB Cluster Disk Data Objects”](mysql-cluster-disk-data-objects.md "25.6.11.1 NDB Cluster Disk Data Objects"), for more
information. `ADD DATAFILE` is not supported with
`InnoDB` tablespaces.

Using `DROP DATAFILE` with
[`ALTER TABLESPACE`](alter-tablespace.md "15.1.10 ALTER TABLESPACE Statement") drops the data
file '*`file_name`*' from an NDB
tablespace. You cannot drop a data file from a tablespace which is
in use by any table; in other words, the data file must be empty
(no extents used). See
[Section 25.6.11.1, “NDB Cluster Disk Data Objects”](mysql-cluster-disk-data-objects.md "25.6.11.1 NDB Cluster Disk Data Objects"). In addition,
any data file to be dropped must previously have been added to the
tablespace with [`CREATE TABLESPACE`](create-tablespace.md "15.1.21 CREATE TABLESPACE Statement")
or [`ALTER TABLESPACE`](alter-tablespace.md "15.1.10 ALTER TABLESPACE Statement"). `DROP
DATAFILE` is not supported with `InnoDB`
tablespaces.

`WAIT` is parsed but otherwise ignored. It is
intended for future expansion.

The `ENGINE` clause, which specifies the storage
engine used by the tablespace, is deprecated; expect it to be
removed in a future release. The tablespace storage engine is
known by the data dictionary, making the `ENGINE`
clause obsolete. If the storage engine is specified, it must match
the tablespace storage engine defined in the data dictionary. The
only values for *`engine_name`* compatible
with [`NDB`](mysql-cluster.md "Chapter 25 MySQL NDB Cluster 8.0") tablespaces are
`NDB` and `NDBCLUSTER`.

`RENAME TO` operations are implicitly performed
in [`autocommit`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_autocommit) mode, regardless of
the [`autocommit`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_autocommit) setting.

A `RENAME TO` operation cannot be performed while
[`LOCK TABLES`](lock-tables.md "15.3.6 LOCK TABLES and UNLOCK TABLES Statements") or
[`FLUSH TABLES WITH READ
LOCK`](flush.md "15.7.8.3 FLUSH Statement") is in effect for tables that reside in the
tablespace.

Exclusive [metadata locks](glossary.md#glos_metadata_lock "metadata lock")
are taken on tables that reside in a general tablespace while the
tablespace is renamed, which prevents concurrent DDL. Concurrent
DML is supported.

The [`CREATE TABLESPACE`](privileges-provided.md#priv_create-tablespace) privilege is
required to rename an `InnoDB` general
tablespace.

The `AUTOEXTEND_SIZE` option defines the amount
by which `InnoDB` extends the size of a
tablespace when it becomes full. Introduced in MySQL 8.0.23. The
setting must be a multiple of 4MB. The default setting is 0, which
causes the tablespace to be extended according to the implicit
default behavior. For more information, see
[Section 17.6.3.9, “Tablespace AUTOEXTEND\_SIZE Configuration”](innodb-tablespace-autoextend-size.md "17.6.3.9 Tablespace AUTOEXTEND_SIZE Configuration").

The `ENCRYPTION` clause enables or disables
page-level data encryption for an `InnoDB`
general tablespace or the `mysql` system
tablespace. Encryption support for general tablespaces was
introduced in MySQL 8.0.13. Encryption support for the
`mysql` system tablespace was introduced in MySQL
8.0.16.

A keyring plugin must be installed and configured before
encryption can be enabled.

As of MySQL 8.0.16, if the
[`table_encryption_privilege_check`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_table_encryption_privilege_check)
variable is enabled, the
[`TABLE_ENCRYPTION_ADMIN`](privileges-provided.md#priv_table-encryption-admin) privilege is
required to alter a general tablespace with an
`ENCRYPTION` clause setting that differs from the
[`default_table_encryption`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_default_table_encryption) setting.

Enabling encryption for a general tablespace fails if any table in
the tablespace belongs to a schema defined with
[`DEFAULT
ENCRYPTION='N'`](create-database.md "15.1.12 CREATE DATABASE Statement"). Similarly, disabling encryption fails if
any table in the general tablespace belongs to a schema defined
with [`DEFAULT
ENCRYPTION='Y'`](create-database.md "15.1.12 CREATE DATABASE Statement"). The
[`DEFAULT
ENCRYPTION`](create-database.md "15.1.12 CREATE DATABASE Statement") schema option was introduced in MySQL 8.0.16.

If an [`ALTER TABLESPACE`](alter-tablespace.md "15.1.10 ALTER TABLESPACE Statement") statement
executed on a general tablespace does not include an
`ENCRYPTION` clause, the tablespace retains its
current encryption status, regardless of the
[`default_table_encryption`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_default_table_encryption) setting.

When a general tablespace or the `mysql` system
tablespace is encrypted, all tables residing in the tablespace are
encrypted. Likewise, a table created in an encrypted tablespace is
encrypted.

The `INPLACE` algorithm is used when altering the
`ENCRYPTION` attribute of a general tablespace or
the `mysql` system tablespace. The
`INPLACE` algorithm permits concurrent DML on
tables that reside in the tablespace. Concurrent DDL is blocked.

For more information, see
[Section 17.13, “InnoDB Data-at-Rest Encryption”](innodb-data-encryption.md "17.13 InnoDB Data-at-Rest Encryption").

The `ENGINE_ATTRIBUTE` option (available as of
MySQL 8.0.21) is used to specify tablespace attributes for primary
storage engines. The option is reserved for future use.

Permitted values are a string literal containing a valid
`JSON` document or an empty string (''). Invalid
`JSON` is rejected.

```sql
ALTER TABLESPACE ts1 ENGINE_ATTRIBUTE='{"key":"value"}';
```

`ENGINE_ATTRIBUTE` values can be repeated without
error. In this case, the last specified value is used.

`ENGINE_ATTRIBUTE` values are not checked by the
server, nor are they cleared when the table's storage engine is
changed.

It is not permitted to alter an individual element of a JSON
attribute value. You can only add or replace an attribute.
