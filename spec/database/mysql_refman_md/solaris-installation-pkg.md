### 2.7.1 Installing MySQL on Solaris Using a Solaris PKG

You can install MySQL on Solaris using a binary package of the
native Solaris PKG format instead of the binary tarball
distribution.

Note

MySQL 5.7 has a dependency on the Oracle Developer Studio
Runtime Libraries; but this does not apply to MySQL 8.0.

To use this package, download the corresponding
`mysql-VERSION-solaris11-PLATFORM.pkg.gz` file,
then uncompress it. For example:

```terminal
$> gunzip mysql-8.0.45-solaris11-x86_64.pkg.gz
```

To install a new package, use **pkgadd** and follow
the onscreen prompts. You must have root privileges to perform
this operation:

```terminal
$> pkgadd -d mysql-8.0.45-solaris11-x86_64.pkg

The following packages are available:
  1  mysql     MySQL Community Server (GPL)
               (i86pc) 8.0.45

Select package(s) you wish to process (or 'all' to process
all packages). (default: all) [?,??,q]:
```

The PKG installer installs all of the files and tools needed, and
then initializes your database if one does not exist. To complete
the installation, you should set the root password for MySQL as
provided in the instructions at the end of the installation.
Alternatively, you can run the
[**mysql\_secure\_installation**](mysql-secure-installation.md "6.4.2 mysql_secure_installation — Improve MySQL Installation Security") script that comes
with the installation.

By default, the PKG package installs MySQL under the root path
`/opt/mysql`. You can change only the
installation root path when using **pkgadd**, which
can be used to install MySQL in a different Solaris zone. If you
need to install in a specific directory, use a binary
**tar** file distribution.

The `pkg` installer copies a suitable startup
script for MySQL into `/etc/init.d/mysql`. To
enable MySQL to startup and shutdown automatically, you should
create a link between this file and the init script directories.
For example, to ensure safe startup and shutdown of MySQL you
could use the following commands to add the right links:

```terminal
$> ln /etc/init.d/mysql /etc/rc3.d/S91mysql
$> ln /etc/init.d/mysql /etc/rc0.d/K02mysql
```

To remove MySQL, the installed package name is
`mysql`. You can use this in combination with the
**pkgrm** command to remove the installation.

To upgrade when using the Solaris package file format, you must
remove the existing installation before installing the updated
package. Removal of the package does not delete the existing
database information, only the server, binaries and support files.
The typical upgrade sequence is therefore:

```terminal
$> mysqladmin shutdown
$> pkgrm mysql
$> pkgadd -d mysql-8.0.45-solaris11-x86_64.pkg
$> mysqld_safe &
$> mysql_upgrade   # prior to MySQL 8.0.16 only
```

You should check the notes in [Chapter 3, *Upgrading MySQL*](upgrading.md "Chapter 3 Upgrading MySQL") before
performing any upgrade.
