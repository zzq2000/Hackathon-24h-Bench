#### 15.1.20.6 CHECK Constraints

Prior to MySQL 8.0.16, [`CREATE
TABLE`](create-table.md "15.1.20 CREATE TABLE Statement") permits only the following limited version of
table `CHECK` constraint syntax, which is
parsed and ignored:

```sql
CHECK (expr)
```

As of MySQL 8.0.16, [`CREATE TABLE`](create-table.md "15.1.20 CREATE TABLE Statement")
permits the core features of table and column
`CHECK` constraints, for all storage engines.
[`CREATE TABLE`](create-table.md "15.1.20 CREATE TABLE Statement") permits the
following `CHECK` constraint syntax, for both
table constraints and column constraints:

```sql
[CONSTRAINT [symbol]] CHECK (expr) [[NOT] ENFORCED]
```

The optional *`symbol`* specifies a name
for the constraint. If omitted, MySQL generates a name from the
table name, a literal `_chk_`, and an ordinal
number (1, 2, 3, ...). Constraint names have a maximum length of
64 characters. They are case-sensitive, but not
accent-sensitive.

*`expr`* specifies the constraint
condition as a boolean expression that must evaluate to
`TRUE` or `UNKNOWN` (for
`NULL` values) for each row of the table. If
the condition evaluates to `FALSE`, it fails
and a constraint violation occurs. The effect of a violation
depends on the statement being executed, as described later in
this section.

The optional enforcement clause indicates whether the constraint
is enforced:

- If omitted or specified as `ENFORCED`, the
  constraint is created and enforced.
- If specified as `NOT ENFORCED`, the
  constraint is created but not enforced.

A `CHECK` constraint is specified as either a
table constraint or column constraint:

- A table constraint does not appear within a column
  definition and can refer to any table column or columns.
  Forward references are permitted to columns appearing later
  in the table definition.
- A column constraint appears within a column definition and
  can refer only to that column.

Consider this table definition:

```sql
CREATE TABLE t1
(
  CHECK (c1 <> c2),
  c1 INT CHECK (c1 > 10),
  c2 INT CONSTRAINT c2_positive CHECK (c2 > 0),
  c3 INT CHECK (c3 < 100),
  CONSTRAINT c1_nonzero CHECK (c1 <> 0),
  CHECK (c1 > c3)
);
```

The definition includes table constraints and column
constraints, in named and unnamed formats:

- The first constraint is a table constraint: It occurs
  outside any column definition, so it can (and does) refer to
  multiple table columns. This constraint contains forward
  references to columns not defined yet. No constraint name is
  specified, so MySQL generates a name.
- The next three constraints are column constraints: Each
  occurs within a column definition, and thus can refer only
  to the column being defined. One of the constraints is named
  explicitly. MySQL generates a name for each of the other
  two.
- The last two constraints are table constraints. One of them
  is named explicitly. MySQL generates a name for the other
  one.

As mentioned, MySQL generates a name for any
`CHECK` constraint specified without one. To
see the names generated for the preceding table definition, use
`SHOW CREATE TABLE`:

```sql
mysql> SHOW CREATE TABLE t1\G
*************************** 1. row ***************************
       Table: t1
Create Table: CREATE TABLE `t1` (
  `c1` int(11) DEFAULT NULL,
  `c2` int(11) DEFAULT NULL,
  `c3` int(11) DEFAULT NULL,
  CONSTRAINT `c1_nonzero` CHECK ((`c1` <> 0)),
  CONSTRAINT `c2_positive` CHECK ((`c2` > 0)),
  CONSTRAINT `t1_chk_1` CHECK ((`c1` <> `c2`)),
  CONSTRAINT `t1_chk_2` CHECK ((`c1` > 10)),
  CONSTRAINT `t1_chk_3` CHECK ((`c3` < 100)),
  CONSTRAINT `t1_chk_4` CHECK ((`c1` > `c3`))
) ENGINE=InnoDB DEFAULT CHARSET=utf8mb4 COLLATE=utf8mb4_0900_ai_ci
```

The SQL standard specifies that all types of constraints
(primary key, unique index, foreign key, check) belong to the
same namespace. In MySQL, each constraint type has its own
namespace per schema (database). Consequently,
`CHECK` constraint names must be unique per
schema; no two tables in the same schema can share a
`CHECK` constraint name. (Exception: A
`TEMPORARY` table hides a
non-`TEMPORARY` table of the same name, so it
can have the same `CHECK` constraint names as
well.)

Beginning generated constraint names with the table name helps
ensure schema uniqueness because table names also must be unique
within the schema.

`CHECK` condition expressions must adhere to
the following rules. An error occurs if an expression contains
disallowed constructs.

- Nongenerated and generated columns are permitted, except
  columns with the `AUTO_INCREMENT` attribute
  and columns in other tables.
- Literals, deterministic built-in functions, and operators
  are permitted. A function is deterministic if, given the
  same data in tables, multiple invocations produce the same
  result, independently of the connected user. Examples of
  functions that are nondeterministic and fail this
  definition: [`CONNECTION_ID()`](information-functions.md#function_connection-id),
  [`CURRENT_USER()`](information-functions.md#function_current-user),
  [`NOW()`](date-and-time-functions.md#function_now).
- Stored functions and loadable functions are not permitted.
- Stored procedure and function parameters are not permitted.
- Variables (system variables, user-defined variables, and
  stored program local variables) are not permitted.
- Subqueries are not permitted.

Foreign key referential actions (`ON UPDATE`,
`ON DELETE`) are prohibited on columns used in
`CHECK` constraints. Likewise,
`CHECK` constraints are prohibited on columns
used in foreign key referential actions.

`CHECK` constraints are evaluated for
[`INSERT`](insert.md "15.2.7 INSERT Statement"),
[`UPDATE`](update.md "15.2.17 UPDATE Statement"),
[`REPLACE`](replace.md "15.2.12 REPLACE Statement"),
[`LOAD DATA`](load-data.md "15.2.9 LOAD DATA Statement"), and
[`LOAD XML`](load-xml.md "15.2.10 LOAD XML Statement") statements and an error
occurs if a constraint evaluates to `FALSE`. If
an error occurs, handling of changes already applied differs for
transactional and nontransactional storage engines, and also
depends on whether strict SQL mode is in effect, as described in
[Strict SQL Mode](sql-mode.md#sql-mode-strict "Strict SQL Mode").

`CHECK` constraints are evaluated for
[`INSERT IGNORE`](insert.md "15.2.7 INSERT Statement"),
[`UPDATE IGNORE`](update.md "15.2.17 UPDATE Statement"),
[`LOAD DATA ...
IGNORE`](load-data.md "15.2.9 LOAD DATA Statement"), and
[`LOAD XML ...
IGNORE`](load-xml.md "15.2.10 LOAD XML Statement") statements and a warning occurs if a constraint
evaluates to `FALSE`. The insert or update for
any offending row is skipped.

If the constraint expression evaluates to a data type that
differs from the declared column type, implicit coercion to the
declared type occurs according to the usual MySQL
type-conversion rules. See [Section 14.3, “Type Conversion in Expression Evaluation”](type-conversion.md "14.3 Type Conversion in Expression Evaluation"). If
type conversion fails or results in a loss of precision, an
error occurs.

Note

Constraint expression evaluation uses the SQL mode in effect
at evaluation time. If any component of the expression depends
on the SQL mode, different results may occur for different
uses of the table unless the SQL mode is the same during all
uses.

The Information Schema
[`CHECK_CONSTRAINTS`](information-schema-check-constraints-table.md "28.3.5 The INFORMATION_SCHEMA CHECK_CONSTRAINTS Table") table provides
information about `CHECK` constraints defined
on tables. See
[Section 28.3.5, “The INFORMATION\_SCHEMA CHECK\_CONSTRAINTS Table”](information-schema-check-constraints-table.md "28.3.5 The INFORMATION_SCHEMA CHECK_CONSTRAINTS Table").
