#### 10.2.1.19 LIMIT Query Optimization

If you need only a specified number of rows from a result set,
use a `LIMIT` clause in the query, rather
than fetching the whole result set and throwing away the extra
data.

MySQL sometimes optimizes a query that has a `LIMIT
row_count` clause and no
`HAVING` clause:

- If you select only a few rows with
  `LIMIT`, MySQL uses indexes in some cases
  when normally it would prefer to do a full table scan.
- If you combine `LIMIT
  row_count` with
  `ORDER BY`, MySQL stops sorting as soon
  as it has found the first
  *`row_count`* rows of the sorted
  result, rather than sorting the entire result. If ordering
  is done by using an index, this is very fast. If a
  filesort must be done, all rows that match the query
  without the `LIMIT` clause are selected,
  and most or all of them are sorted, before the first
  *`row_count`* are found. After the
  initial rows have been found, MySQL does not sort any
  remainder of the result set.

  One manifestation of this behavior is that an
  `ORDER BY` query with and without
  `LIMIT` may return rows in different
  order, as described later in this section.
- If you combine `LIMIT
  row_count` with
  `DISTINCT`, MySQL stops as soon as it
  finds *`row_count`* unique rows.
- In some cases, a `GROUP BY` can be
  resolved by reading the index in order (or doing a sort on
  the index), then calculating summaries until the index
  value changes. In this case, `LIMIT
  row_count` does not
  calculate any unnecessary `GROUP BY`
  values.
- As soon as MySQL has sent the required number of rows to
  the client, it aborts the query unless you are using
  `SQL_CALC_FOUND_ROWS`. In that case, the
  number of rows can be retrieved with `SELECT
  FOUND_ROWS()`. See
  [Section 14.15, “Information Functions”](information-functions.md "14.15 Information Functions").
- `LIMIT 0` quickly returns an empty set.
  This can be useful for checking the validity of a query.
  It can also be employed to obtain the types of the result
  columns within applications that use a MySQL API that
  makes result set metadata available. With the
  [**mysql**](mysql.md "6.5.1 mysql — The MySQL Command-Line Client") client program, you can use the
  [`--column-type-info`](mysql-command-options.md#option_mysql_column-type-info) option to
  display result column types.
- If the server uses temporary tables to resolve a query, it
  uses the `LIMIT
  row_count` clause to
  calculate how much space is required.
- If an index is not used for `ORDER BY`
  but a `LIMIT` clause is also present, the
  optimizer may be able to avoid using a merge file and sort
  the rows in memory using an in-memory
  `filesort` operation.

If multiple rows have identical values in the `ORDER
BY` columns, the server is free to return those rows
in any order, and may do so differently depending on the
overall execution plan. In other words, the sort order of
those rows is nondeterministic with respect to the nonordered
columns.

One factor that affects the execution plan is
`LIMIT`, so an `ORDER BY`
query with and without `LIMIT` may return
rows in different orders. Consider this query, which is sorted
by the `category` column but nondeterministic
with respect to the `id` and
`rating` columns:

```sql
mysql> SELECT * FROM ratings ORDER BY category;
+----+----------+--------+
| id | category | rating |
+----+----------+--------+
|  1 |        1 |    4.5 |
|  5 |        1 |    3.2 |
|  3 |        2 |    3.7 |
|  4 |        2 |    3.5 |
|  6 |        2 |    3.5 |
|  2 |        3 |    5.0 |
|  7 |        3 |    2.7 |
+----+----------+--------+
```

Including `LIMIT` may affect order of rows
within each `category` value. For example,
this is a valid query result:

```sql
mysql> SELECT * FROM ratings ORDER BY category LIMIT 5;
+----+----------+--------+
| id | category | rating |
+----+----------+--------+
|  1 |        1 |    4.5 |
|  5 |        1 |    3.2 |
|  4 |        2 |    3.5 |
|  3 |        2 |    3.7 |
|  6 |        2 |    3.5 |
+----+----------+--------+
```

In each case, the rows are sorted by the `ORDER
BY` column, which is all that is required by the SQL
standard.

If it is important to ensure the same row order with and
without `LIMIT`, include additional columns
in the `ORDER BY` clause to make the order
deterministic. For example, if `id` values
are unique, you can make rows for a given
`category` value appear in
`id` order by sorting like this:

```sql
mysql> SELECT * FROM ratings ORDER BY category, id;
+----+----------+--------+
| id | category | rating |
+----+----------+--------+
|  1 |        1 |    4.5 |
|  5 |        1 |    3.2 |
|  3 |        2 |    3.7 |
|  4 |        2 |    3.5 |
|  6 |        2 |    3.5 |
|  2 |        3 |    5.0 |
|  7 |        3 |    2.7 |
+----+----------+--------+

mysql> SELECT * FROM ratings ORDER BY category, id LIMIT 5;
+----+----------+--------+
| id | category | rating |
+----+----------+--------+
|  1 |        1 |    4.5 |
|  5 |        1 |    3.2 |
|  3 |        2 |    3.7 |
|  4 |        2 |    3.5 |
|  6 |        2 |    3.5 |
+----+----------+--------+
```

For a query with an `ORDER BY` or
`GROUP BY` and a `LIMIT`
clause, the optimizer tries to choose an ordered index by
default when it appears doing so would speed up query
execution. Prior to MySQL 8.0.21, there was no way to override
this behavior, even in cases where using some other
optimization might be faster. Beginning with MySQL 8.0.21, it
is possible to turn off this optimization by setting the
[`optimizer_switch`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_optimizer_switch) system
variable's
[`prefer_ordering_index`](switchable-optimizations.md#optflag_prefer-ordering-index) flag
to `off`.

*Example*: First we create and populate a
table `t` as shown here:

```sql
# Create and populate a table t:

mysql> CREATE TABLE t (
    ->     id1 BIGINT NOT NULL,
    ->     id2 BIGINT NOT NULL,
    ->     c1 VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
    ->     c2 VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
    ->  PRIMARY KEY (id1),
    ->  INDEX i (id2, c1)
    -> );

# [Insert some rows into table t - not shown]
```

Verify that the
[`prefer_ordering_index`](switchable-optimizations.md#optflag_prefer-ordering-index) flag
is enabled:

```sql
mysql> SELECT @@optimizer_switch LIKE '%prefer_ordering_index=on%';
+------------------------------------------------------+
| @@optimizer_switch LIKE '%prefer_ordering_index=on%' |
+------------------------------------------------------+
|                                                    1 |
+------------------------------------------------------+
```

Since the following query has a `LIMIT`
clause, we expect it to use an ordered index, if possible. In
this case, as we can see from the
[`EXPLAIN`](explain.md "15.8.2 EXPLAIN Statement") output, it uses the
table's primary key.

```sql
mysql> EXPLAIN SELECT c2 FROM t
    ->     WHERE id2 > 3
    ->     ORDER BY id1 ASC LIMIT 2\G
*************************** 1. row ***************************
           id: 1
  select_type: SIMPLE
        table: t
   partitions: NULL
         type: index
possible_keys: i
          key: PRIMARY
      key_len: 8
          ref: NULL
         rows: 2
     filtered: 70.00
        Extra: Using where
```

Now we disable the
[`prefer_ordering_index`](switchable-optimizations.md#optflag_prefer-ordering-index) flag,
and re-run the same query; this time it uses the index
`i` (which includes the
`id2` column used in the
`WHERE` clause), and a filesort:

```sql
mysql> SET optimizer_switch = "prefer_ordering_index=off";

mysql> EXPLAIN SELECT c2 FROM t
    ->     WHERE id2 > 3
    ->     ORDER BY id1 ASC LIMIT 2\G
*************************** 1. row ***************************
           id: 1
  select_type: SIMPLE
        table: t
   partitions: NULL
         type: range
possible_keys: i
          key: i
      key_len: 8
          ref: NULL
         rows: 14
     filtered: 100.00
        Extra: Using index condition; Using filesort
```
