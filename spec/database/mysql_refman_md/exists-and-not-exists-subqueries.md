#### 15.2.15.6 Subqueries with EXISTS or NOT EXISTS

If a subquery returns any rows at all, `EXISTS
subquery` is
`TRUE`, and `NOT EXISTS
subquery` is
`FALSE`. For example:

```sql
SELECT column1 FROM t1 WHERE EXISTS (SELECT * FROM t2);
```

Traditionally, an `EXISTS` subquery starts with
`SELECT *`, but it could begin with
`SELECT 5` or `SELECT column1`
or anything at all. MySQL ignores the
[`SELECT`](select.md "15.2.13 SELECT Statement") list in such a subquery,
so it makes no difference.

For the preceding example, if `t2` contains any
rows, even rows with nothing but `NULL` values,
the `EXISTS` condition is
`TRUE`. This is actually an unlikely example
because a `[NOT] EXISTS` subquery almost always
contains correlations. Here are some more realistic examples:

- What kind of store is present in one or more cities?

  ```sql
  SELECT DISTINCT store_type FROM stores
    WHERE EXISTS (SELECT * FROM cities_stores
                  WHERE cities_stores.store_type = stores.store_type);
  ```
- What kind of store is present in no cities?

  ```sql
  SELECT DISTINCT store_type FROM stores
    WHERE NOT EXISTS (SELECT * FROM cities_stores
                      WHERE cities_stores.store_type = stores.store_type);
  ```
- What kind of store is present in all cities?

  ```sql
  SELECT DISTINCT store_type FROM stores
    WHERE NOT EXISTS (
      SELECT * FROM cities WHERE NOT EXISTS (
        SELECT * FROM cities_stores
         WHERE cities_stores.city = cities.city
         AND cities_stores.store_type = stores.store_type));
  ```

The last example is a double-nested `NOT
EXISTS` query. That is, it has a `NOT
EXISTS` clause within a `NOT EXISTS`
clause. Formally, it answers the question “does a city
exist with a store that is not in
`Stores`”? But it is easier to say that
a nested `NOT EXISTS` answers the question
“is *`x`* `TRUE`
for all *`y`*?”

In MySQL 8.0.19 and later, you can also use `NOT
EXISTS` or `NOT EXISTS` with
[`TABLE`](table.md "15.2.16 TABLE Statement") in the subquery, like this:

```sql
SELECT column1 FROM t1 WHERE EXISTS (TABLE t2);
```

The results are the same as when using `SELECT
*` with no `WHERE` clause in the
subquery.
