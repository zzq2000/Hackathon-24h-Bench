#### B.3.2.14 Table 'tbl\_name' doesn't exist

If you get either of the following errors, it usually means
that no table exists in the default database with the given
name:

```none
Table 'tbl_name' doesn't exist
Can't find file: 'tbl_name' (errno: 2)
```

In some cases, it may be that the table does exist but that
you are referring to it incorrectly:

- Because MySQL uses directories and files to store
  databases and tables, database and table names are
  case-sensitive if they are located on a file system that
  has case-sensitive file names.
- Even for file systems that are not case-sensitive, such as
  on Windows, all references to a given table within a query
  must use the same lettercase.

You can check which tables are in the default database with
[`SHOW TABLES`](show-tables.md "15.7.7.39 SHOW TABLES Statement"). See
[Section 15.7.7, “SHOW Statements”](show.md "15.7.7 SHOW Statements").
