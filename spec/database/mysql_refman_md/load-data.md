### 15.2.9 LOAD DATA Statement

```sql
LOAD DATA
    [LOW_PRIORITY | CONCURRENT] [LOCAL]
    INFILE 'file_name'
    [REPLACE | IGNORE]
    INTO TABLE tbl_name
    [PARTITION (partition_name [, partition_name] ...)]
    [CHARACTER SET charset_name]
    [{FIELDS | COLUMNS}
        [TERMINATED BY 'string']
        [[OPTIONALLY] ENCLOSED BY 'char']
        [ESCAPED BY 'char']
    ]
    [LINES
        [STARTING BY 'string']
        [TERMINATED BY 'string']
    ]
    [IGNORE number {LINES | ROWS}]
    [(col_name_or_user_var
        [, col_name_or_user_var] ...)]
    [SET col_name={expr | DEFAULT}
        [, col_name={expr | DEFAULT}] ...]
```

The [`LOAD DATA`](load-data.md "15.2.9 LOAD DATA Statement") statement reads rows
from a text file into a table at a very high speed. The file can
be read from the server host or the client host, depending on
whether the `LOCAL` modifier is given.
`LOCAL` also affects data interpretation and
error handling.

[`LOAD DATA`](load-data.md "15.2.9 LOAD DATA Statement") is the complement of
[`SELECT ... INTO
OUTFILE`](select-into.md "15.2.13.1 SELECT ... INTO Statement"). (See [Section 15.2.13.1, “SELECT ... INTO Statement”](select-into.md "15.2.13.1 SELECT ... INTO Statement").) To write
data from a table to a file, use
[`SELECT ... INTO
OUTFILE`](select-into.md "15.2.13.1 SELECT ... INTO Statement"). To read the file back into a table, use
[`LOAD DATA`](load-data.md "15.2.9 LOAD DATA Statement"). The syntax of the
`FIELDS` and `LINES` clauses is
the same for both statements.

The [**mysqlimport**](mysqlimport.md "6.5.5 mysqlimport — A Data Import Program") utility provides another way to
load data files; it operates by sending a
[`LOAD DATA`](load-data.md "15.2.9 LOAD DATA Statement") statement to the server.
See [Section 6.5.5, “mysqlimport — A Data Import Program”](mysqlimport.md "6.5.5 mysqlimport — A Data Import Program").

#### Non-LOCAL Versus LOCAL Operation

The `LOCAL` modifier affects these aspects of
[`LOAD DATA`](load-data.md "15.2.9 LOAD DATA Statement"), compared to
non-`LOCAL` operation:

- It changes the expected location of the input file; see
  [Input File Location](load-data.md#load-data-file-location "Input File Location").
- It changes the statement security requirements; see
  [Security Requirements](load-data.md#load-data-security-requirements "Security Requirements").
- Unless `REPLACE` is also specified,
  `LOCAL` has the same effect as the
  `IGNORE` modifier on the interpretation of
  input file contents and error handling; see
  [Duplicate-Key and Error Handling](load-data.md#load-data-error-handling "Duplicate-Key and Error Handling"), and
  [Column Value Assignment](load-data.md#load-data-column-assignments "Column Value Assignment").

`LOCAL` works only if the server and your
client both have been configured to permit it. For example, if
[**mysqld**](mysqld.md "6.3.1 mysqld — The MySQL Server") was started with the
[`local_infile`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_local_infile) system variable
disabled, `LOCAL` produces an error. See
[Section 8.1.6, “Security Considerations for LOAD DATA LOCAL”](load-data-local-security.md "8.1.6 Security Considerations for LOAD DATA LOCAL").

#### Input File Character Set

The file name must be given as a literal string. On Windows,
specify backslashes in path names as forward slashes or doubled
backslashes. The server interprets the file name using the
character set indicated by the
[`character_set_filesystem`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_character_set_filesystem) system
variable.

By default, the server interprets the file contents using the
character set indicated by the
[`character_set_database`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_character_set_database) system
variable. If the file contents use a character set different
from this default, it is a good idea to specify that character
set by using the `CHARACTER SET` clause. A
character set of `binary` specifies “no
conversion.”

[`SET NAMES`](set-names.md "15.7.6.3 SET NAMES Statement") and the setting of
[`character_set_client`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_character_set_client) do not
affect interpretation of file contents.

[`LOAD DATA`](load-data.md "15.2.9 LOAD DATA Statement") interprets all fields
in the file as having the same character set, regardless of the
data types of the columns into which field values are loaded.
For proper interpretation of the file, you must ensure that it
was written with the correct character set. For example, if you
write a data file with [**mysqldump -T**](mysqldump.md "6.5.4 mysqldump — A Database Backup Program") or by
issuing a [`SELECT
... INTO OUTFILE`](select-into.md "15.2.13.1 SELECT ... INTO Statement") statement in
[**mysql**](mysql.md "6.5.1 mysql — The MySQL Command-Line Client"), be sure to use a
[`--default-character-set`](mysql-command-options.md#option_mysql_default-character-set) option to
write output in the character set to be used when the file is
loaded with [`LOAD DATA`](load-data.md "15.2.9 LOAD DATA Statement").

Note

It is not possible to load data files that use the
`ucs2`, `utf16`,
`utf16le`, or `utf32`
character set.

#### Input File Location

These rules determine the [`LOAD
DATA`](load-data.md "15.2.9 LOAD DATA Statement") input file location:

- If `LOCAL` is not specified, the file must
  be located on the server host. The server reads the file
  directly, locating it as follows:

  - If the file name is an absolute path name, the server
    uses it as given.
  - If the file name is a relative path name with leading
    components, the server looks for the file relative to
    its data directory.
  - If the file name has no leading components, the server
    looks for the file in the database directory of the
    default database.
- If `LOCAL` is specified, the file must be
  located on the client host. The client program reads the
  file, locating it as follows:

  - If the file name is an absolute path name, the client
    program uses it as given.
  - If the file name is a relative path name, the client
    program looks for the file relative to its invocation
    directory.

  When `LOCAL` is used, the client program
  reads the file and sends its contents to the server. The
  server creates a copy of the file in the directory where it
  stores temporary files. See
  [Section B.3.3.5, “Where MySQL Stores Temporary Files”](temporary-files.md "B.3.3.5 Where MySQL Stores Temporary Files"). Lack of sufficient space
  for the copy in this directory can cause the
  [`LOAD DATA
  LOCAL`](load-data.md "15.2.9 LOAD DATA Statement") statement to fail.

The non-`LOCAL` rules mean that the server
reads a file named as `./myfile.txt` relative
to its data directory, whereas it reads a file named as
`myfile.txt` from the database directory of
the default database. For example, if the following
[`LOAD DATA`](load-data.md "15.2.9 LOAD DATA Statement") statement is executed
while `db1` is the default database, the server
reads the file `data.txt` from the database
directory for `db1`, even though the statement
explicitly loads the file into a table in the
`db2` database:

```sql
LOAD DATA INFILE 'data.txt' INTO TABLE db2.my_table;
```

Note

The server also uses the non-`LOCAL` rules to
locate `.sdi` files for the
[`IMPORT TABLE`](import-table.md "15.2.6 IMPORT TABLE Statement") statement.

#### Security Requirements

For a non-`LOCAL` load operation, the server
reads a text file located on the server host, so these security
requirements must be satisfied:

- You must have the [`FILE`](privileges-provided.md#priv_file)
  privilege. See [Section 8.2.2, “Privileges Provided by MySQL”](privileges-provided.md "8.2.2 Privileges Provided by MySQL").
- The operation is subject to the
  [`secure_file_priv`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_secure_file_priv) system
  variable setting:

  - If the variable value is a nonempty directory name, the
    file must be located in that directory.
  - If the variable value is empty (which is insecure), the
    file need only be readable by the server.

For a `LOCAL` load operation, the client
program reads a text file located on the client host. Because
the file contents are sent over the connection by the client to
the server, using `LOCAL` is a bit slower than
when the server accesses the file directly. On the other hand,
you do not need the [`FILE`](privileges-provided.md#priv_file)
privilege, and the file can be located in any directory the
client program can access.

#### Duplicate-Key and Error Handling

The `REPLACE` and `IGNORE`
modifiers control handling of new (input) rows that duplicate
existing table rows on unique key values (`PRIMARY
KEY` or `UNIQUE` index values):

- With `REPLACE`, new rows that have the same
  value as a unique key value in an existing row replace the
  existing row. See [Section 15.2.12, “REPLACE Statement”](replace.md "15.2.12 REPLACE Statement").
- With `IGNORE`, new rows that duplicate an
  existing row on a unique key value are discarded. For more
  information, see
  [The Effect of IGNORE on Statement Execution](sql-mode.md#ignore-effect-on-execution "The Effect of IGNORE on Statement Execution").

The `LOCAL` modifier has the same effect as
`IGNORE`. This occurs because the server has no
way to stop transmission of the file in the middle of the
operation.

If none of `REPLACE`,
`IGNORE`, or `LOCAL` is
specified, an error occurs when a duplicate key value is found,
and the rest of the text file is ignored.

In addition to affecting duplicate-key handling as just
described, `IGNORE` and
`LOCAL` also affect error handling:

- When neither `IGNORE` nor
  `LOCAL` is specified, data-interpretation
  errors terminate the operation.
- When `IGNORE`—or
  `LOCAL` without
  `REPLACE`—is specified, data
  interpretation errors become warnings and the load operation
  continues, even if the SQL mode is restrictive. For
  examples, see
  [Column Value Assignment](load-data.md#load-data-column-assignments "Column Value Assignment").

#### Index Handling

To ignore foreign key constraints during the load operation,
execute a `SET foreign_key_checks = 0`
statement before executing [`LOAD
DATA`](load-data.md "15.2.9 LOAD DATA Statement").

If you use [`LOAD DATA`](load-data.md "15.2.9 LOAD DATA Statement") on an empty
`MyISAM` table, all nonunique indexes are
created in a separate batch (as for [`REPAIR
TABLE`](repair-table.md "15.7.3.5 REPAIR TABLE Statement")). Normally, this makes [`LOAD
DATA`](load-data.md "15.2.9 LOAD DATA Statement") much faster when you have many indexes. In some
extreme cases, you can create the indexes even faster by turning
them off with [`ALTER
TABLE ... DISABLE KEYS`](alter-table.md "15.1.9 ALTER TABLE Statement") before loading the file into
the table and re-creating the indexes with
[`ALTER TABLE ...
ENABLE KEYS`](alter-table.md "15.1.9 ALTER TABLE Statement") after loading the file. See
[Section 10.2.5.1, “Optimizing INSERT Statements”](insert-optimization.md "10.2.5.1 Optimizing INSERT Statements").

#### Field and Line Handling

For both the [`LOAD DATA`](load-data.md "15.2.9 LOAD DATA Statement") and
[`SELECT ... INTO
OUTFILE`](select-into.md "15.2.13.1 SELECT ... INTO Statement") statements, the syntax of the
`FIELDS` and `LINES` clauses
is the same. Both clauses are optional, but
`FIELDS` must precede `LINES`
if both are specified.

If you specify a `FIELDS` clause, each of its
subclauses (`TERMINATED BY`,
`[OPTIONALLY] ENCLOSED BY`, and
`ESCAPED BY`) is also optional, except that you
must specify at least one of them. Arguments to these clauses
are permitted to contain only ASCII characters.

If you specify no `FIELDS` or
`LINES` clause, the defaults are the same as if
you had written this:

```sql
FIELDS TERMINATED BY '\t' ENCLOSED BY '' ESCAPED BY '\\'
LINES TERMINATED BY '\n' STARTING BY ''
```

Backslash is the MySQL escape character within strings in SQL
statements. Thus, to specify a literal backslash, you must
specify two backslashes for the value to be interpreted as a
single backslash. The escape sequences `'\t'`
and `'\n'` specify tab and newline characters,
respectively.

In other words, the defaults cause [`LOAD
DATA`](load-data.md "15.2.9 LOAD DATA Statement") to act as follows when reading input:

- Look for line boundaries at newlines.
- Do not skip any line prefix.
- Break lines into fields at tabs.
- Do not expect fields to be enclosed within any quoting
  characters.
- Interpret characters preceded by the escape character
  `\` as escape sequences. For example,
  `\t`, `\n`, and
  `\\` signify tab, newline, and backslash,
  respectively. See the discussion of `FIELDS ESCAPED
  BY` later for the full list of escape sequences.

Conversely, the defaults cause
[`SELECT ... INTO
OUTFILE`](select-into.md "15.2.13.1 SELECT ... INTO Statement") to act as follows when writing output:

- Write tabs between fields.
- Do not enclose fields within any quoting characters.
- Use `\` to escape instances of tab,
  newline, or `\` that occur within field
  values.
- Write newlines at the ends of lines.

Note

For a text file generated on a Windows system, proper file
reading might require `LINES TERMINATED BY
'\r\n'` because Windows programs typically use two
characters as a line terminator. Some programs, such as
**WordPad**, might use `\r` as
a line terminator when writing files. To read such files, use
`LINES TERMINATED BY '\r'`.

If all the input lines have a common prefix that you want to
ignore, you can use `LINES STARTING BY
'prefix_string'` to skip the
prefix *and anything before it*. If a line
does not include the prefix, the entire line is skipped. Suppose
that you issue the following statement:

```sql
LOAD DATA INFILE '/tmp/test.txt' INTO TABLE test
  FIELDS TERMINATED BY ','  LINES STARTING BY 'xxx';
```

If the data file looks like this:

```none
xxx"abc",1
something xxx"def",2
"ghi",3
```

The resulting rows are `("abc",1)` and
`("def",2)`. The third row in the file is
skipped because it does not contain the prefix.

The `IGNORE number
LINES` clause can be used to ignore lines at the start
of the file. For example, you can use `IGNORE 1
LINES` to skip an initial header line containing column
names:

```sql
LOAD DATA INFILE '/tmp/test.txt' INTO TABLE test IGNORE 1 LINES;
```

When you use [`SELECT
... INTO OUTFILE`](select-into.md "15.2.13.1 SELECT ... INTO Statement") in tandem with
[`LOAD DATA`](load-data.md "15.2.9 LOAD DATA Statement") to write data from a
database into a file and then read the file back into the
database later, the field- and line-handling options for both
statements must match. Otherwise, [`LOAD
DATA`](load-data.md "15.2.9 LOAD DATA Statement") does not interpret the contents of the file
properly. Suppose that you use
[`SELECT ... INTO
OUTFILE`](select-into.md "15.2.13.1 SELECT ... INTO Statement") to write a file with fields delimited by
commas:

```sql
SELECT * INTO OUTFILE 'data.txt'
  FIELDS TERMINATED BY ','
  FROM table2;
```

To read the comma-delimited file, the correct statement is:

```sql
LOAD DATA INFILE 'data.txt' INTO TABLE table2
  FIELDS TERMINATED BY ',';
```

If instead you tried to read the file with the statement shown
following, it would not work because it instructs
[`LOAD DATA`](load-data.md "15.2.9 LOAD DATA Statement") to look for tabs
between fields:

```sql
LOAD DATA INFILE 'data.txt' INTO TABLE table2
  FIELDS TERMINATED BY '\t';
```

The likely result is that each input line would be interpreted
as a single field.

[`LOAD DATA`](load-data.md "15.2.9 LOAD DATA Statement") can be used to read
files obtained from external sources. For example, many programs
can export data in comma-separated values (CSV) format, such
that lines have fields separated by commas and enclosed within
double quotation marks, with an initial line of column names. If
the lines in such a file are terminated by carriage
return/newline pairs, the statement shown here illustrates the
field- and line-handling options you would use to load the file:

```sql
LOAD DATA INFILE 'data.txt' INTO TABLE tbl_name
  FIELDS TERMINATED BY ',' ENCLOSED BY '"'
  LINES TERMINATED BY '\r\n'
  IGNORE 1 LINES;
```

If the input values are not necessarily enclosed within
quotation marks, use `OPTIONALLY` before the
`ENCLOSED BY` option.

Any of the field- or line-handling options can specify an empty
string (`''`). If not empty, the
`FIELDS [OPTIONALLY] ENCLOSED BY` and
`FIELDS ESCAPED BY` values must be a single
character. The `FIELDS TERMINATED BY`,
`LINES STARTING BY`, and `LINES
TERMINATED BY` values can be more than one character.
For example, to write lines that are terminated by carriage
return/linefeed pairs, or to read a file containing such lines,
specify a `LINES TERMINATED BY '\r\n'` clause.

To read a file containing jokes that are separated by lines
consisting of `%%`, you can do this

```sql
CREATE TABLE jokes
  (a INT NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
  joke TEXT NOT NULL);
LOAD DATA INFILE '/tmp/jokes.txt' INTO TABLE jokes
  FIELDS TERMINATED BY ''
  LINES TERMINATED BY '\n%%\n' (joke);
```

`FIELDS [OPTIONALLY] ENCLOSED BY` controls
quoting of fields. For output
([`SELECT ... INTO
OUTFILE`](select-into.md "15.2.13.1 SELECT ... INTO Statement")), if you omit the word
`OPTIONALLY`, all fields are enclosed by the
`ENCLOSED BY` character. An example of such
output (using a comma as the field delimiter) is shown here:

```none
"1","a string","100.20"
"2","a string containing a , comma","102.20"
"3","a string containing a \" quote","102.20"
"4","a string containing a \", quote and comma","102.20"
```

If you specify `OPTIONALLY`, the
`ENCLOSED BY` character is used only to enclose
values from columns that have a string data type (such as
[`CHAR`](char.md "13.3.2 The CHAR and VARCHAR Types"),
[`BINARY`](binary-varbinary.md "13.3.3 The BINARY and VARBINARY Types"),
[`TEXT`](blob.md "13.3.4 The BLOB and TEXT Types"), or
[`ENUM`](enum.md "13.3.5 The ENUM Type")):

```none
1,"a string",100.20
2,"a string containing a , comma",102.20
3,"a string containing a \" quote",102.20
4,"a string containing a \", quote and comma",102.20
```

Occurrences of the `ENCLOSED BY` character
within a field value are escaped by prefixing them with the
`ESCAPED BY` character. Also, if you specify an
empty `ESCAPED BY` value, it is possible to
inadvertently generate output that cannot be read properly by
[`LOAD DATA`](load-data.md "15.2.9 LOAD DATA Statement"). For example, the
preceding output just shown would appear as follows if the
escape character is empty. Observe that the second field in the
fourth line contains a comma following the quote, which
(erroneously) appears to terminate the field:

```none
1,"a string",100.20
2,"a string containing a , comma",102.20
3,"a string containing a " quote",102.20
4,"a string containing a ", quote and comma",102.20
```

For input, the `ENCLOSED BY` character, if
present, is stripped from the ends of field values. (This is
true regardless of whether `OPTIONALLY` is
specified; `OPTIONALLY` has no effect on input
interpretation.) Occurrences of the `ENCLOSED
BY` character preceded by the `ESCAPED
BY` character are interpreted as part of the current
field value.

If the field begins with the `ENCLOSED BY`
character, instances of that character are recognized as
terminating a field value only if followed by the field or line
`TERMINATED BY` sequence. To avoid ambiguity,
occurrences of the `ENCLOSED BY` character
within a field value can be doubled and are interpreted as a
single instance of the character. For example, if
`ENCLOSED BY '"'` is specified, quotation marks
are handled as shown here:

```none
"The ""BIG"" boss"  -> The "BIG" boss
The "BIG" boss      -> The "BIG" boss
The ""BIG"" boss    -> The ""BIG"" boss
```

`FIELDS ESCAPED BY` controls how to read or
write special characters:

- For input, if the `FIELDS ESCAPED BY`
  character is not empty, occurrences of that character are
  stripped and the following character is taken literally as
  part of a field value. Some two-character sequences that are
  exceptions, where the first character is the escape
  character. These sequences are shown in the following table
  (using `\` for the escape character). The
  rules for `NULL` handling are described
  later in this section.

  | Character | Escape Sequence |
  | --- | --- |
  | `\0` | An ASCII NUL (`X'00'`) character |
  | `\b` | A backspace character |
  | `\n` | A newline (linefeed) character |
  | `\r` | A carriage return character |
  | `\t` | A tab character. |
  | `\Z` | ASCII 26 (Control+Z) |
  | `\N` | NULL |

  For more information about `\`-escape
  syntax, see [Section 11.1.1, “String Literals”](string-literals.md "11.1.1 String Literals").

  If the `FIELDS ESCAPED BY` character is
  empty, escape-sequence interpretation does not occur.
- For output, if the `FIELDS ESCAPED BY`
  character is not empty, it is used to prefix the following
  characters on output:

  - The `FIELDS ESCAPED BY` character.
  - The `FIELDS [OPTIONALLY] ENCLOSED BY`
    character.
  - The first character of the `FIELDS TERMINATED
    BY` and `LINES TERMINATED BY`
    values, if the `ENCLOSED BY` character
    is empty or unspecified.
  - ASCII `0` (what is actually written
    following the escape character is ASCII
    `0`, not a zero-valued byte).

  If the `FIELDS ESCAPED BY` character is
  empty, no characters are escaped and `NULL`
  is output as `NULL`, not
  `\N`. It is probably not a good idea to
  specify an empty escape character, particularly if field
  values in your data contain any of the characters in the
  list just given.

In certain cases, field- and line-handling options interact:

- If `LINES TERMINATED BY` is an empty string
  and `FIELDS TERMINATED BY` is nonempty,
  lines are also terminated with `FIELDS TERMINATED
  BY`.
- If the `FIELDS TERMINATED BY` and
  `FIELDS ENCLOSED BY` values are both empty
  (`''`), a fixed-row (nondelimited) format
  is used. With fixed-row format, no delimiters are used
  between fields (but you can still have a line terminator).
  Instead, column values are read and written using a field
  width wide enough to hold all values in the field. For
  [`TINYINT`](integer-types.md "13.1.2 Integer Types (Exact Value) - INTEGER, INT, SMALLINT, TINYINT, MEDIUMINT, BIGINT"),
  [`SMALLINT`](integer-types.md "13.1.2 Integer Types (Exact Value) - INTEGER, INT, SMALLINT, TINYINT, MEDIUMINT, BIGINT"),
  [`MEDIUMINT`](integer-types.md "13.1.2 Integer Types (Exact Value) - INTEGER, INT, SMALLINT, TINYINT, MEDIUMINT, BIGINT"),
  [`INT`](integer-types.md "13.1.2 Integer Types (Exact Value) - INTEGER, INT, SMALLINT, TINYINT, MEDIUMINT, BIGINT"), and
  [`BIGINT`](integer-types.md "13.1.2 Integer Types (Exact Value) - INTEGER, INT, SMALLINT, TINYINT, MEDIUMINT, BIGINT"), the field widths are
  4, 6, 8, 11, and 20, respectively, no matter what the
  declared display width is.

  `LINES TERMINATED BY` is still used to
  separate lines. If a line does not contain all fields, the
  rest of the columns are set to their default values. If you
  do not have a line terminator, you should set this to
  `''`. In this case, the text file must
  contain all fields for each row.

  Fixed-row format also affects handling of
  `NULL` values, as described later.

  Note

  Fixed-size format does not work if you are using a
  multibyte character set.

Handling of `NULL` values varies according to
the `FIELDS` and `LINES`
options in use:

- For the default `FIELDS` and
  `LINES` values, `NULL` is
  written as a field value of `\N` for
  output, and a field value of `\N` is read
  as `NULL` for input (assuming that the
  `ESCAPED BY` character is
  `\`).
- If `FIELDS ENCLOSED BY` is not empty, a
  field containing the literal word `NULL` as
  its value is read as a `NULL` value. This
  differs from the word `NULL` enclosed
  within `FIELDS ENCLOSED BY` characters,
  which is read as the string `'NULL'`.
- If `FIELDS ESCAPED BY` is empty,
  `NULL` is written as the word
  `NULL`.
- With fixed-row format (which is used when `FIELDS
  TERMINATED BY` and `FIELDS ENCLOSED
  BY` are both empty), `NULL` is
  written as an empty string. This causes both
  `NULL` values and empty strings in the
  table to be indistinguishable when written to the file
  because both are written as empty strings. If you need to be
  able to tell the two apart when reading the file back in,
  you should not use fixed-row format.

An attempt to load `NULL` into a `NOT
NULL` column produces either a warning or an error
according to the rules described in
[Column Value Assignment](load-data.md#load-data-column-assignments "Column Value Assignment").

Some cases are not supported by [`LOAD
DATA`](load-data.md "15.2.9 LOAD DATA Statement"):

- Fixed-size rows (`FIELDS TERMINATED BY` and
  `FIELDS ENCLOSED BY` both empty) and
  [`BLOB`](blob.md "13.3.4 The BLOB and TEXT Types") or
  [`TEXT`](blob.md "13.3.4 The BLOB and TEXT Types") columns.
- If you specify one separator that is the same as or a prefix
  of another, [`LOAD DATA`](load-data.md "15.2.9 LOAD DATA Statement") cannot
  interpret the input properly. For example, the following
  `FIELDS` clause would cause problems:

  ```sql
  FIELDS TERMINATED BY '"' ENCLOSED BY '"'
  ```
- If `FIELDS ESCAPED BY` is empty, a field
  value that contains an occurrence of `FIELDS
  ENCLOSED BY` or `LINES TERMINATED
  BY` followed by the `FIELDS TERMINATED
  BY` value causes [`LOAD
  DATA`](load-data.md "15.2.9 LOAD DATA Statement") to stop reading a field or line too early.
  This happens because [`LOAD
  DATA`](load-data.md "15.2.9 LOAD DATA Statement") cannot properly determine where the field or
  line value ends.

#### Column List Specification

The following example loads all columns of the
`persondata` table:

```sql
LOAD DATA INFILE 'persondata.txt' INTO TABLE persondata;
```

By default, when no column list is provided at the end of the
[`LOAD DATA`](load-data.md "15.2.9 LOAD DATA Statement") statement, input lines
are expected to contain a field for each table column. If you
want to load only some of a table's columns, specify a column
list:

```sql
LOAD DATA INFILE 'persondata.txt' INTO TABLE persondata
(col_name_or_user_var [, col_name_or_user_var] ...);
```

You must also specify a column list if the order of the fields
in the input file differs from the order of the columns in the
table. Otherwise, MySQL cannot tell how to match input fields
with table columns.

#### Input Preprocessing

Each instance of *`col_name_or_user_var`*
in [`LOAD DATA`](load-data.md "15.2.9 LOAD DATA Statement") syntax is either a
column name or a user variable. With user variables, the
`SET` clause enables you to perform
preprocessing transformations on their values before assigning
the result to columns.

User variables in the `SET` clause can be used
in several ways. The following example uses the first input
column directly for the value of `t1.column1`,
and assigns the second input column to a user variable that is
subjected to a division operation before being used for the
value of `t1.column2`:

```sql
LOAD DATA INFILE 'file.txt'
  INTO TABLE t1
  (column1, @var1)
  SET column2 = @var1/100;
```

The `SET` clause can be used to supply values
not derived from the input file. The following statement sets
`column3` to the current date and time:

```sql
LOAD DATA INFILE 'file.txt'
  INTO TABLE t1
  (column1, column2)
  SET column3 = CURRENT_TIMESTAMP;
```

You can also discard an input value by assigning it to a user
variable and not assigning the variable to any table column:

```sql
LOAD DATA INFILE 'file.txt'
  INTO TABLE t1
  (column1, @dummy, column2, @dummy, column3);
```

Use of the column/variable list and `SET`
clause is subject to the following restrictions:

- Assignments in the `SET` clause should have
  only column names on the left hand side of assignment
  operators.
- You can use subqueries in the right hand side of
  `SET` assignments. A subquery that returns
  a value to be assigned to a column may be a scalar subquery
  only. Also, you cannot use a subquery to select from the
  table that is being loaded.
- Lines ignored by an `IGNORE
  number LINES` clause are
  not processed for the column/variable list or
  `SET` clause.
- User variables cannot be used when loading data with
  fixed-row format because user variables do not have a
  display width.

#### Column Value Assignment

To process an input line, [`LOAD
DATA`](load-data.md "15.2.9 LOAD DATA Statement") splits it into fields and uses the values
according to the column/variable list and the
`SET` clause, if they are present. Then the
resulting row is inserted into the table. If there are
`BEFORE INSERT` or `AFTER
INSERT` triggers for the table, they are activated
before or after inserting the row, respectively.

Interpretation of field values and assignment to table columns
depends on these factors:

- The SQL mode (the value of the
  [`sql_mode`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_sql_mode) system variable).
  The mode can be nonrestrictive, or restrictive in various
  ways. For example, strict SQL mode can be enabled, or the
  mode can include values such as
  [`NO_ZERO_DATE`](sql-mode.md#sqlmode_no_zero_date) or
  [`NO_ZERO_IN_DATE`](sql-mode.md#sqlmode_no_zero_in_date).
- Presence or absence of the `IGNORE` and
  `LOCAL` modifiers.

Those factors combine to produce restrictive or nonrestrictive
data interpretation by [`LOAD DATA`](load-data.md "15.2.9 LOAD DATA Statement"):

- Data interpretation is restrictive if the SQL mode is
  restrictive and neither the `IGNORE` nor
  the `LOCAL` modifier is specified. Errors
  terminate the load operation.
- Data interpretation is nonrestrictive if the SQL mode is
  nonrestrictive or the `IGNORE` or
  `LOCAL` modifier is specified. (In
  particular, either modifier if specified
  *overrides* a restrictive SQL mode when
  the `REPLACE` modifier is omitted.) Errors
  become warnings and the load operation continues.

Restrictive data interpretation uses these rules:

- Too many or too few fields results an error.
- Assigning `NULL` (that is,
  `\N`) to a non-`NULL`
  column results in an error.
- A value that is out of range for the column data type
  results in an error.
- Invalid values produce errors. For example, a value such as
  `'x'` for a numeric column results in an
  error, not conversion to 0.

By contrast, nonrestrictive data interpretation uses these
rules:

- If an input line has too many fields, the extra fields are
  ignored and the number of warnings is incremented.
- If an input line has too few fields, the columns for which
  input fields are missing are assigned their default values.
  Default value assignment is described in
  [Section 13.6, “Data Type Default Values”](data-type-defaults.md "13.6 Data Type Default Values").
- Assigning `NULL` (that is,
  `\N`) to a non-`NULL`
  column results in assignment of the implicit default value
  for the column data type. Implicit default values are
  described in [Section 13.6, “Data Type Default Values”](data-type-defaults.md "13.6 Data Type Default Values").
- Invalid values produce warnings rather than errors, and are
  converted to the “closest” valid value for the
  column data type. Examples:

  - A value such as `'x'` for a numeric
    column results in conversion to 0.
  - An out-of-range numeric or temporal value is clipped to
    the closest endpoint of the range for the column data
    type.
  - An invalid value for a `DATETIME`,
    `DATE`, or `TIME`
    column is inserted as the implicit default value,
    regardless of the SQL mode
    [`NO_ZERO_DATE`](sql-mode.md#sqlmode_no_zero_date) setting.
    The implicit default is the appropriate
    “zero” value for the type
    (`'0000-00-00 00:00:00'`,
    `'0000-00-00'`, or
    `'00:00:00'`). See
    [Section 13.2, “Date and Time Data Types”](date-and-time-types.md "13.2 Date and Time Data Types").
- [`LOAD DATA`](load-data.md "15.2.9 LOAD DATA Statement") interprets an empty
  field value differently from a missing field:

  - For string types, the column is set to the empty string.
  - For numeric types, the column is set to
    `0`.
  - For date and time types, the column is set to the
    appropriate “zero” value for the type. See
    [Section 13.2, “Date and Time Data Types”](date-and-time-types.md "13.2 Date and Time Data Types").

  These are the same values that result if you assign an empty
  string explicitly to a string, numeric, or date or time type
  explicitly in an [`INSERT`](insert.md "15.2.7 INSERT Statement") or
  [`UPDATE`](update.md "15.2.17 UPDATE Statement") statement.

[`TIMESTAMP`](datetime.md "13.2.2 The DATE, DATETIME, and TIMESTAMP Types") columns are set to the
current date and time only if there is a `NULL`
value for the column (that is, `\N`) and the
column is not declared to permit `NULL` values,
or if the [`TIMESTAMP`](datetime.md "13.2.2 The DATE, DATETIME, and TIMESTAMP Types") column
default value is the current timestamp and it is omitted from
the field list when a field list is specified.

[`LOAD DATA`](load-data.md "15.2.9 LOAD DATA Statement") regards all input as
strings, so you cannot use numeric values for
[`ENUM`](enum.md "13.3.5 The ENUM Type") or
[`SET`](set.md "13.3.6 The SET Type") columns the way you can with
[`INSERT`](insert.md "15.2.7 INSERT Statement") statements. All
[`ENUM`](enum.md "13.3.5 The ENUM Type") and
[`SET`](set.md "13.3.6 The SET Type") values must be specified as
strings.

[`BIT`](bit-type.md "13.1.5 Bit-Value Type - BIT") values cannot be loaded
directly using binary notation (for example,
`b'011010'`). To work around this, use the
`SET` clause to strip off the leading
`b'` and trailing `'` and
perform a base-2 to base-10 conversion so that MySQL loads the
values into the [`BIT`](bit-type.md "13.1.5 Bit-Value Type - BIT") column
properly:

```terminal
$> cat /tmp/bit_test.txt
b'10'
b'1111111'
$> mysql test
mysql> LOAD DATA INFILE '/tmp/bit_test.txt'
       INTO TABLE bit_test (@var1)
       SET b = CAST(CONV(MID(@var1, 3, LENGTH(@var1)-3), 2, 10) AS UNSIGNED);
Query OK, 2 rows affected (0.00 sec)
Records: 2  Deleted: 0  Skipped: 0  Warnings: 0

mysql> SELECT BIN(b+0) FROM bit_test;
+----------+
| BIN(b+0) |
+----------+
| 10       |
| 1111111  |
+----------+
2 rows in set (0.00 sec)
```

For [`BIT`](bit-type.md "13.1.5 Bit-Value Type - BIT") values in
`0b` binary notation (for example,
`0b011010`), use this `SET`
clause instead to strip off the leading `0b`:

```sql
SET b = CAST(CONV(MID(@var1, 3, LENGTH(@var1)-2), 2, 10) AS UNSIGNED)
```

#### Partitioned Table Support

[`LOAD DATA`](load-data.md "15.2.9 LOAD DATA Statement") supports explicit
partition selection using the `PARTITION`
clause with a list of one or more comma-separated names of
partitions, subpartitions, or both. When this clause is used, if
any rows from the file cannot be inserted into any of the
partitions or subpartitions named in the list, the statement
fails with the error Found a row not matching the
given partition set. For more information and
examples, see [Section 26.5, “Partition Selection”](partitioning-selection.md "26.5 Partition Selection").

#### Concurrency Considerations

With the `LOW_PRIORITY` modifier, execution of
the [`LOAD DATA`](load-data.md "15.2.9 LOAD DATA Statement") statement is
delayed until no other clients are reading from the table. This
affects only storage engines that use only table-level locking
(such as `MyISAM`, `MEMORY`,
and `MERGE`).

With the `CONCURRENT` modifier and a
`MyISAM` table that satisfies the condition for
concurrent inserts (that is, it contains no free blocks in the
middle), other threads can retrieve data from the table while
[`LOAD DATA`](load-data.md "15.2.9 LOAD DATA Statement") is executing. This
modifier affects the performance of [`LOAD
DATA`](load-data.md "15.2.9 LOAD DATA Statement") a bit, even if no other thread is using the table
at the same time.

#### Statement Result Information

When the [`LOAD DATA`](load-data.md "15.2.9 LOAD DATA Statement") statement
finishes, it returns an information string in the following
format:

```none
Records: 1  Deleted: 0  Skipped: 0  Warnings: 0
```

Warnings occur under the same circumstances as when values are
inserted using the [`INSERT`](insert.md "15.2.7 INSERT Statement")
statement (see [Section 15.2.7, “INSERT Statement”](insert.md "15.2.7 INSERT Statement")), except that
[`LOAD DATA`](load-data.md "15.2.9 LOAD DATA Statement") also generates warnings
when there are too few or too many fields in the input row.

You can use [`SHOW WARNINGS`](show-warnings.md "15.7.7.42 SHOW WARNINGS Statement") to get
a list of the first
[`max_error_count`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_max_error_count) warnings as
information about what went wrong. See
[Section 15.7.7.42, “SHOW WARNINGS Statement”](show-warnings.md "15.7.7.42 SHOW WARNINGS Statement").

If you are using the C API, you can get information about the
statement by calling the
[`mysql_info()`](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/c-api/8.0/en/mysql-info.html) function. See
[mysql\_info()](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/c-api/8.0/en/mysql-info.html).

#### Replication Considerations

[`LOAD DATA`](load-data.md "15.2.9 LOAD DATA Statement") is considered unsafe
for statement-based replication. If you use
[`LOAD DATA`](load-data.md "15.2.9 LOAD DATA Statement") with
[`binlog_format=STATEMENT`](replication-options-binary-log.md#sysvar_binlog_format), each
replica on which the changes are to be applied creates a
temporary file containing the data. This temporary file is not
encrypted, even if binary log encryption is active on the
source, If encryption is required, use row-based or mixed binary
logging format instead, for which replicas do not create the
temporary file. For more information on the interaction between
[`LOAD DATA`](load-data.md "15.2.9 LOAD DATA Statement") and replication, see
[Section 19.5.1.19, “Replication and LOAD DATA”](replication-features-load-data.md "19.5.1.19 Replication and LOAD DATA").

#### Miscellaneous Topics

On Unix, if you need [`LOAD DATA`](load-data.md "15.2.9 LOAD DATA Statement") to
read from a pipe, you can use the following technique (the
example loads a listing of the `/` directory
into the table `db1.t1`):

```terminal
mkfifo /mysql/data/db1/ls.dat
chmod 666 /mysql/data/db1/ls.dat
find / -ls > /mysql/data/db1/ls.dat &
mysql -e "LOAD DATA INFILE 'ls.dat' INTO TABLE t1" db1
```

Here you must run the command that generates the data to be
loaded and the [**mysql**](mysql.md "6.5.1 mysql — The MySQL Command-Line Client") commands either on
separate terminals, or run the data generation process in the
background (as shown in the preceding example). If you do not do
this, the pipe blocks until data is read by the
[**mysql**](mysql.md "6.5.1 mysql — The MySQL Command-Line Client") process.
