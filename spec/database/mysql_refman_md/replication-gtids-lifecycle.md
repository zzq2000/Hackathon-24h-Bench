#### 19.1.3.2 GTID Life Cycle

The life cycle of a GTID consists of the following steps:

1. A transaction is executed and committed on the source. This
   client transaction is assigned a GTID composed of the source's
   UUID and the smallest nonzero transaction sequence number not
   yet used on this server. The GTID is written to the source's
   binary log (immediately preceding the transaction itself in
   the log). If a client transaction is not written to the binary
   log (for example, because the transaction was filtered out, or
   the transaction was read-only), it is not assigned a GTID.
2. If a GTID was assigned for the transaction, the GTID is
   persisted atomically at commit time by writing it to the
   binary log at the beginning of the transaction (as a
   `Gtid_log_event`). Whenever the binary log is
   rotated or the server is shut down, the server writes GTIDs
   for all transactions that were written into the previous
   binary log file into the
   `mysql.gtid_executed` table.
3. If a GTID was assigned for the transaction, the GTID is
   externalized non-atomically (very shortly after the
   transaction is committed) by adding it to the set of GTIDs in
   the [`gtid_executed`](replication-options-gtids.md#sysvar_gtid_executed) system
   variable (`@@GLOBAL.gtid_executed`). This
   GTID set contains a representation of the set of all committed
   GTID transactions, and it is used in replication as a token
   that represents the server state. With binary logging enabled
   (as required for the source), the set of GTIDs in the
   [`gtid_executed`](replication-options-gtids.md#sysvar_gtid_executed) system variable
   is a complete record of the transactions applied, but the
   `mysql.gtid_executed` table is not, because
   the most recent history is still in the current binary log
   file.
4. After the binary log data is transmitted to the replica and
   stored in the replica's relay log (using established
   mechanisms for this process, see
   [Section 19.2, “Replication Implementation”](replication-implementation.md "19.2 Replication Implementation"), for details),
   the replica reads the GTID and sets the value of its
   [`gtid_next`](replication-options-gtids.md#sysvar_gtid_next) system variable as
   this GTID. This tells the replica that the next transaction
   must be logged using this GTID. It is important to note that
   the replica sets `gtid_next` in a session
   context.
5. The replica verifies that no thread has yet taken ownership of
   the GTID in [`gtid_next`](replication-options-gtids.md#sysvar_gtid_next) in
   order to process the transaction. By reading and checking the
   replicated transaction's GTID first, before processing the
   transaction itself, the replica guarantees not only that no
   previous transaction having this GTID has been applied on the
   replica, but also that no other session has already read this
   GTID but has not yet committed the associated transaction. So
   if multiple clients attempt to apply the same transaction
   concurrently, the server resolves this by letting only one of
   them execute. The [`gtid_owned`](replication-options-gtids.md#sysvar_gtid_owned)
   system variable (`@@GLOBAL.gtid_owned`) for
   the replica shows each GTID that is currently in use and the
   ID of the thread that owns it. If the GTID has already been
   used, no error is raised, and the auto-skip function is used
   to ignore the transaction.
6. If the GTID has not been used, the replica applies the
   replicated transaction. Because
   [`gtid_next`](replication-options-gtids.md#sysvar_gtid_next) is set to the GTID
   already assigned by the source, the replica does not attempt
   to generate a new GTID for this transaction, but instead uses
   the GTID stored in [`gtid_next`](replication-options-gtids.md#sysvar_gtid_next).
7. If binary logging is enabled on the replica, the GTID is
   persisted atomically at commit time by writing it to the
   binary log at the beginning of the transaction (as a
   `Gtid_log_event`). Whenever the binary log is
   rotated or the server is shut down, the server writes GTIDs
   for all transactions that were written into the previous
   binary log file into the
   `mysql.gtid_executed` table.
8. If binary logging is disabled on the replica, the GTID is
   persisted atomically by writing it directly into the
   `mysql.gtid_executed` table. MySQL appends a
   statement to the transaction to insert the GTID into the
   table. From MySQL 8.0, this operation is atomic for DDL
   statements as well as for DML statements. In this situation,
   the `mysql.gtid_executed` table is a complete
   record of the transactions applied on the replica.
9. Very shortly after the replicated transaction is committed on
   the replica, the GTID is externalized non-atomically by adding
   it to the set of GTIDs in the
   [`gtid_executed`](replication-options-gtids.md#sysvar_gtid_executed) system variable
   (`@@GLOBAL.gtid_executed`) for the replica.
   As for the source, this GTID set contains a representation of
   the set of all committed GTID transactions. If binary logging
   is disabled on the replica, the
   `mysql.gtid_executed` table is also a
   complete record of the transactions applied on the replica. If
   binary logging is enabled on the replica, meaning that some
   GTIDs are only recorded in the binary log, the set of GTIDs in
   the [`gtid_executed`](replication-options-gtids.md#sysvar_gtid_executed) system
   variable is the only complete record.

Client transactions that are completely filtered out on the source
are not assigned a GTID, therefore they are not added to the set
of transactions in the
[`gtid_executed`](replication-options-gtids.md#sysvar_gtid_executed) system variable, or
added to the `mysql.gtid_executed` table.
However, the GTIDs of replicated transactions that are completely
filtered out on the replica are persisted. If binary logging is
enabled on the replica, the filtered-out transaction is written to
the binary log as a `Gtid_log_event` followed by
an empty transaction containing only `BEGIN` and
`COMMIT` statements. If binary logging is
disabled, the GTID of the filtered-out transaction is written to
the `mysql.gtid_executed` table. Preserving the
GTIDs for filtered-out transactions ensures that the
`mysql.gtid_executed` table and the set of GTIDs
in the [`gtid_executed`](replication-options-gtids.md#sysvar_gtid_executed) system
variable can be compressed. It also ensures that the filtered-out
transactions are not retrieved again if the replica reconnects to
the source, as explained in
[Section 19.1.3.3, “GTID Auto-Positioning”](replication-gtids-auto-positioning.md "19.1.3.3 GTID Auto-Positioning").

On a multithreaded replica (with
[`replica_parallel_workers > 0`](replication-options-replica.md#sysvar_replica_parallel_workers) or
[`slave_parallel_workers > 0`](replication-options-replica.md#sysvar_slave_parallel_workers) ),
transactions can be applied in parallel, so replicated
transactions can commit out of order (unless
[`replica_preserve_commit_order=1`](replication-options-replica.md#sysvar_replica_preserve_commit_order)
or [`slave_preserve_commit_order=1`](replication-options-replica.md#sysvar_slave_preserve_commit_order)
is set). When that happens, the set of GTIDs in the
[`gtid_executed`](replication-options-gtids.md#sysvar_gtid_executed) system variable
contains multiple GTID ranges with gaps between them. (On a source
or a single-threaded replica, there are monotonically increasing
GTIDs without gaps between the numbers.) Gaps on multithreaded
replicas only occur among the most recently applied transactions,
and are filled in as replication progresses. When replication
threads are stopped cleanly using the [`STOP
REPLICA`](stop-replica.md "15.4.2.8 STOP REPLICA Statement") statement, ongoing transactions are applied so
that the gaps are filled in. In the event of a shutdown such as a
server failure or the use of the
[`KILL`](kill.md "15.7.8.4 KILL Statement") statement to stop replication
threads, the gaps might remain.

##### What changes are assigned a GTID?

The typical scenario is that the server generates a new GTID for
a committed transaction. However, GTIDs can also be assigned to
other changes besides transactions, and in some cases a single
transaction can be assigned multiple GTIDs.

Every database change (DDL or DML) that is written to the binary
log is assigned a GTID. This includes changes that are
autocommitted, and changes that are committed using
`BEGIN` and `COMMIT` or
`START TRANSACTION` statements. A GTID is also
assigned to the creation, alteration, or deletion of a database,
and of a non-table database object such as a procedure,
function, trigger, event, view, user, role, or grant.

Non-transactional updates as well as transactional updates are
assigned GTIDs. In addition, for a non-transactional update, if
a disk write failure occurs while attempting to write to the
binary log cache and a gap is therefore created in the binary
log, the resulting incident log event is assigned a GTID.

When a table is automatically dropped by a generated statement
in the binary log, a GTID is assigned to the statement.
Temporary tables are dropped automatically when a replica begins
to apply events from a source that has just been started, and
when statement-based replication is in use
([`binlog_format=STATEMENT`](replication-options-binary-log.md#sysvar_binlog_format)) and a
user session that has open temporary tables disconnects. Tables
that use the [`MEMORY`](memory-storage-engine.md "18.3 The MEMORY Storage Engine") storage engine
are deleted automatically the first time they are accessed after
the server is started, because rows might have been lost during
the shutdown.

When a transaction is not written to the binary log on the
server of origin, the server does not assign a GTID to it. This
includes transactions that are rolled back and transactions that
are executed while binary logging is disabled on the server of
origin, either globally (with `--skip-log-bin`
specified in the server's configuration) or for the session
(`SET @@SESSION.sql_log_bin = 0`). This also
includes no-op transactions when row-based replication is in use
([`binlog_format=ROW`](replication-options-binary-log.md#sysvar_binlog_format)).

XA transactions are assigned separate GTIDs for the `XA
PREPARE` phase of the transaction and the `XA
COMMIT` or `XA ROLLBACK` phase of the
transaction. XA transactions are persistently prepared so that
users can commit them or roll them back in the case of a failure
(which in a replication topology might include a failover to
another server). The two parts of the transaction are therefore
replicated separately, so they must have their own GTIDs, even
though a non-XA transaction that is rolled back would not have a
GTID.

In the following special cases, a single statement can generate
multiple transactions, and therefore be assigned multiple GTIDs:

- A stored procedure is invoked that commits multiple
  transactions. One GTID is generated for each transaction
  that the procedure commits.
- A multi-table [`DROP TABLE`](drop-table.md "15.1.32 DROP TABLE Statement")
  statement drops tables of different types. Multiple GTIDs
  can be generated if any of the tables use storage engines
  that do not support atomic DDL, or if any of the tables are
  temporary tables.
- A
  [`CREATE
  TABLE ... SELECT`](create-table-select.md "15.1.20.4 CREATE TABLE ... SELECT Statement") statement is issued when
  row-based replication is in use
  ([`binlog_format=ROW`](replication-options-binary-log.md#sysvar_binlog_format)). One
  GTID is generated for the [`CREATE
  TABLE`](create-table.md "15.1.20 CREATE TABLE Statement") action and one GTID is generated for the
  row-insert actions.

##### The `gtid_next` System Variable

By default, for new transactions committed in user sessions, the
server automatically generates and assigns a new GTID. When the
transaction is applied on a replica, the GTID from the server of
origin is preserved. You can change this behavior by setting the
session value of the [`gtid_next`](replication-options-gtids.md#sysvar_gtid_next)
system variable:

- When [`gtid_next`](replication-options-gtids.md#sysvar_gtid_next) is set to
  `AUTOMATIC`, which is the default, and a
  transaction is committed and written to the binary log, the
  server automatically generates and assigns a new GTID. If a
  transaction is rolled back or not written to the binary log
  for another reason, the server does not generate and assign
  a GTID.
- If you set [`gtid_next`](replication-options-gtids.md#sysvar_gtid_next) to a
  valid GTID (consisting of a UUID and a transaction sequence
  number, separated by a colon), the server assigns that GTID
  to your transaction. This GTID is assigned and added to
  [`gtid_executed`](replication-options-gtids.md#sysvar_gtid_executed) even when the
  transaction is not written to the binary log, or when the
  transaction is empty.

Note that after you set
[`gtid_next`](replication-options-gtids.md#sysvar_gtid_next) to a specific GTID,
and the transaction has been committed or rolled back, an
explicit `SET @@SESSION.gtid_next` statement
must be issued before any other statement. You can use this to
set the GTID value back to `AUTOMATIC` if you
do not want to assign any more GTIDs explicitly.

When replication applier threads apply replicated transactions,
they use this technique, setting
`@@SESSION.gtid_next` explicitly to the GTID of
the replicated transaction as assigned on the server of origin.
This means the GTID from the server of origin is retained,
rather than a new GTID being generated and assigned by the
replica. It also means the GTID is added to
[`gtid_executed`](replication-options-gtids.md#sysvar_gtid_executed) on the replica
even when binary logging or replica update logging is disabled
on the replica, or when the transaction is a no-op or is
filtered out on the replica.

It is possible for a client to simulate a replicated transaction
by setting `@@SESSION.gtid_next` to a specific
GTID before executing the transaction. This technique is used by
[**mysqlbinlog**](mysqlbinlog.md "6.6.9 mysqlbinlog — Utility for Processing Binary Log Files") to generate a dump of the binary
log that the client can replay to preserve GTIDs. A simulated
replicated transaction committed through a client is completely
equivalent to a replicated transaction committed through a
replication applier thread, and they cannot be distinguished
after the fact.

##### The `gtid_purged` System Variable

The set of GTIDs in the
[`gtid_purged`](replication-options-gtids.md#sysvar_gtid_purged) system variable
(`@@GLOBAL.gtid_purged`) contains the GTIDs of
all the transactions that have been committed on the server, but
do not exist in any binary log file on the server.
[`gtid_purged`](replication-options-gtids.md#sysvar_gtid_purged) is a subset of
[`gtid_executed`](replication-options-gtids.md#sysvar_gtid_executed). The following
categories of GTIDs are in
[`gtid_purged`](replication-options-gtids.md#sysvar_gtid_purged):

- GTIDs of replicated transactions that were committed with
  binary logging disabled on the replica.
- GTIDs of transactions that were written to a binary log file
  that has now been purged.
- GTIDs that were added explicitly to the set by the statement
  `SET @@GLOBAL.gtid_purged`.

You can change the value of
[`gtid_purged`](replication-options-gtids.md#sysvar_gtid_purged) in order to record
on the server that the transactions in a certain GTID set have
been applied, although they do not exist in any binary log on
the server. When you add GTIDs to
[`gtid_purged`](replication-options-gtids.md#sysvar_gtid_purged), they are also
added to [`gtid_executed`](replication-options-gtids.md#sysvar_gtid_executed). An
example use case for this action is when you are restoring a
backup of one or more databases on a server, but you do not have
the relevant binary logs containing the transactions on the
server. Before MySQL 8.0, you could only change the value of
[`gtid_purged`](replication-options-gtids.md#sysvar_gtid_purged) when
[`gtid_executed`](replication-options-gtids.md#sysvar_gtid_executed) (and therefore
[`gtid_purged`](replication-options-gtids.md#sysvar_gtid_purged)) was empty. From
MySQL 8.0, this restriction does not apply, and you can also
choose whether to replace the whole GTID set in
[`gtid_purged`](replication-options-gtids.md#sysvar_gtid_purged) with a specified
GTID set, or to add a specified GTID set to the GTIDs already in
[`gtid_purged`](replication-options-gtids.md#sysvar_gtid_purged). For details of how
to do this, see the description for
[`gtid_purged`](replication-options-gtids.md#sysvar_gtid_purged).

The sets of GTIDs in the
[`gtid_executed`](replication-options-gtids.md#sysvar_gtid_executed) and
[`gtid_purged`](replication-options-gtids.md#sysvar_gtid_purged) system variables
are initialized when the server starts. Every binary log file
begins with the event
`Previous_gtids_log_event`, which contains the
set of GTIDs in all previous binary log files (composed from the
GTIDs in the preceding file's
`Previous_gtids_log_event`, and the GTIDs of
every `Gtid_log_event` in the preceding file
itself). The contents of
`Previous_gtids_log_event` in the oldest and
most recent binary log files are used to compute the
[`gtid_executed`](replication-options-gtids.md#sysvar_gtid_executed) and
[`gtid_purged`](replication-options-gtids.md#sysvar_gtid_purged) sets at server
startup:

- [`gtid_executed`](replication-options-gtids.md#sysvar_gtid_executed) is computed
  as the union of the GTIDs in
  `Previous_gtids_log_event` in the most
  recent binary log file, the GTIDs of transactions in that
  binary log file, and the GTIDs stored in the
  `mysql.gtid_executed` table. This GTID set
  contains all the GTIDs that have been used (or added
  explicitly to [`gtid_purged`](replication-options-gtids.md#sysvar_gtid_purged))
  on the server, whether or not they are currently in a binary
  log file on the server. It does not include the GTIDs for
  transactions that are currently being processed on the
  server (`@@GLOBAL.gtid_owned`).
- [`gtid_purged`](replication-options-gtids.md#sysvar_gtid_purged) is computed by
  first adding the GTIDs in
  `Previous_gtids_log_event` in the most
  recent binary log file and the GTIDs of transactions in that
  binary log file. This step gives the set of GTIDs that are
  currently, or were once, recorded in a binary log on the
  server (`gtids_in_binlog`). Next, the GTIDs
  in `Previous_gtids_log_event` in the oldest
  binary log file are subtracted from
  `gtids_in_binlog`. This step gives the set
  of GTIDs that are currently recorded in a binary log on the
  server (`gtids_in_binlog_not_purged`).
  Finally, `gtids_in_binlog_not_purged` is
  subtracted from
  [`gtid_executed`](replication-options-gtids.md#sysvar_gtid_executed). The result
  is the set of GTIDs that have been used on the server, but
  are not currently recorded in a binary log file on the
  server, and this result is used to initialize
  [`gtid_purged`](replication-options-gtids.md#sysvar_gtid_purged).

If binary logs from MySQL 5.7.7 or older are involved in these
computations, it is possible for incorrect GTID sets to be
computed for [`gtid_executed`](replication-options-gtids.md#sysvar_gtid_executed) and
[`gtid_purged`](replication-options-gtids.md#sysvar_gtid_purged), and they remain
incorrect even if the server is later restarted. For details,
see the description for the
[`binlog_gtid_simple_recovery`](replication-options-gtids.md#sysvar_binlog_gtid_simple_recovery)
system variable, which controls how the binary logs are iterated
to compute the GTID sets. If one of the situations described
there applies on a server, set
[`binlog_gtid_simple_recovery=FALSE`](replication-options-gtids.md#sysvar_binlog_gtid_simple_recovery)
in the server's configuration file before starting it. That
setting makes the server iterate all the binary log files (not
just the newest and oldest) to find where GTID events start to
appear. This process could take a long time if the server has a
large number of binary log files without GTID events.

##### Resetting the GTID Execution History

If you need to reset the GTID execution history on a server, use
the [`RESET MASTER`](reset-master.md "15.4.1.2 RESET MASTER Statement") statement. For
example, you might need to do this after carrying out test
queries to verify a replication setup on new GTID-enabled
servers, or when you want to join a new server to a replication
group but it contains some unwanted local transactions that are
not accepted by Group Replication.

Warning

Use [`RESET MASTER`](reset-master.md "15.4.1.2 RESET MASTER Statement") with caution
to avoid losing any wanted GTID execution history and binary
log files.

Before issuing [`RESET MASTER`](reset-master.md "15.4.1.2 RESET MASTER Statement"),
ensure that you have backups of the server's binary log files
and binary log index file, if any, and obtain and save the GTID
set held in the global value of the
[`gtid_executed`](replication-options-gtids.md#sysvar_gtid_executed) system variable
(for example, by issuing a `SELECT
@@GLOBAL.gtid_executed` statement and saving the
results). If you are removing unwanted transactions from that
GTID set, use [**mysqlbinlog**](mysqlbinlog.md "6.6.9 mysqlbinlog — Utility for Processing Binary Log Files") to examine the
contents of the transactions to ensure that they have no value,
contain no data that must be saved or replicated, and did not
result in data changes on the server.

When you issue [`RESET MASTER`](reset-master.md "15.4.1.2 RESET MASTER Statement"), the
following reset operations are carried out:

- The value of the
  [`gtid_purged`](replication-options-gtids.md#sysvar_gtid_purged) system variable
  is set to an empty string (`''`).
- The global value (but not the session value) of the
  [`gtid_executed`](replication-options-gtids.md#sysvar_gtid_executed) system
  variable is set to an empty string.
- The `mysql.gtid_executed` table is cleared
  (see
  [mysql.gtid\_executed Table](replication-gtids-concepts.md#replication-gtids-gtid-executed-table "mysql.gtid_executed Table")).
- If the server has binary logging enabled, the existing
  binary log files are deleted and the binary log index file
  is cleared.

Note that [`RESET MASTER`](reset-master.md "15.4.1.2 RESET MASTER Statement") is the
method to reset the GTID execution history even if the server is
a replica where binary logging is disabled.
[`RESET REPLICA`](reset-replica.md "15.4.2.4 RESET REPLICA Statement") has no effect on
the GTID execution history.
