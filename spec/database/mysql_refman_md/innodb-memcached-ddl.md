#### 17.20.6.6 Performing DML and DDL Statements on the Underlying InnoDB Table

You can access the underlying `InnoDB` table
(which is `test.demo_test` by default) through
standard SQL interfaces. However, there are some restrictions:

- When querying a table that is also accessed through the
  **memcached** interface, remember that
  **memcached** operations can be configured to
  be committed periodically rather than after every write
  operation. This behavior is controlled by the
  [`daemon_memcached_w_batch_size`](innodb-parameters.md#sysvar_daemon_memcached_w_batch_size)
  option. If this option is set to a value greater than
  `1`, use [`READ
  UNCOMMITTED`](innodb-transaction-isolation-levels.md#isolevel_read-uncommitted) queries to find rows that were just
  inserted.

  ```sql
  mysql> SET SESSSION TRANSACTION ISOLATION LEVEL READ UNCOMMITTED;

  mysql> SELECT * FROM demo_test;
  +------+------+------+------+-----------+------+------+------+------+------+------+
  | cx   | cy   | c1   | cz   | c2        | ca   | CB   | c3   | cu   | c4   | C5   |
  +------+------+------+------+-----------+------+------+------+------+------+------+
  | NULL | NULL | a11  | NULL | 123456789 | NULL | NULL |   10 | NULL |    3 | NULL |
  +------+------+------+------+-----------+------+------+------+------+------+------+
  ```
- When modifying a table using SQL that is also accessed
  through the **memcached** interface, you can
  configure **memcached** operations to start a
  new transaction periodically rather than for every read
  operation. This behavior is controlled by the
  [`daemon_memcached_r_batch_size`](innodb-parameters.md#sysvar_daemon_memcached_r_batch_size)
  option. If this option is set to a value greater than
  `1`, changes made to the table using SQL
  are not immediately visible to **memcached**
  operations.
- The `InnoDB` table is either IS (intention
  shared) or IX (intention exclusive) locked for all
  operations in a transaction. If you increase
  [`daemon_memcached_r_batch_size`](innodb-parameters.md#sysvar_daemon_memcached_r_batch_size)
  and
  [`daemon_memcached_w_batch_size`](innodb-parameters.md#sysvar_daemon_memcached_w_batch_size)
  substantially from their default value of
  `1`, the table is most likely locked
  between each operation, preventing
  [DDL](glossary.md#glos_ddl "DDL") statements on the table.
