#### 15.7.7.36 SHOW SLAVE | REPLICA STATUS Statement

```sql
SHOW {SLAVE | REPLICA} STATUS [FOR CHANNEL channel]
```

This statement provides status information on essential
parameters of the replica threads. From MySQL 8.0.22,
[`SHOW SLAVE STATUS`](show-slave-status.md "15.7.7.36 SHOW SLAVE | REPLICA STATUS Statement") is deprecated
and the alias [`SHOW REPLICA STATUS`](show-replica-status.md "15.7.7.35 SHOW REPLICA STATUS Statement")
should be used instead. The statement works in the same way as
before, only the terminology used for the statement and its
output has changed. Both versions of the statement update the
same status variables when used. Please see the documentation
for [`SHOW REPLICA STATUS`](show-replica-status.md "15.7.7.35 SHOW REPLICA STATUS Statement") for a
description of the statement.
