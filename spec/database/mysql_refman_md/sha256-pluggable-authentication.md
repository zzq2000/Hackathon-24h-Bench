#### 8.4.1.3 SHA-256 Pluggable Authentication

MySQL provides two authentication plugins that implement SHA-256
hashing for user account passwords:

- `caching_sha2_password`: Implements SHA-256
  authentication (like the deprecated
  `sha256_password`), but uses caching on the
  server side for better performance and has additional
  features for wider applicability.
- `sha256_password`: Implements basic SHA-256
  authentication. This is deprecated as of MySQL 8.0.16 and
  subject to removal in the future.

This section describes the original noncaching SHA-2
authentication plugin. For information about the caching plugin,
see [Section 8.4.1.2, “Caching SHA-2 Pluggable Authentication”](caching-sha2-pluggable-authentication.md "8.4.1.2 Caching SHA-2 Pluggable Authentication").

Important

In MySQL 8.0, `caching_sha2_password` is the
default authentication plugin rather than
`mysql_native_password`. For information
about the implications of this change for server operation and
compatibility of the server with clients and connectors, see
[caching\_sha2\_password as the Preferred Authentication Plugin](upgrading-from-previous-series.md#upgrade-caching-sha2-password "caching_sha2_password as the Preferred Authentication Plugin").

Because `caching_sha2_password` is the
default authentication plugin in MySQL 8.0 and provides a
superset of the capabilities of the
`sha256_password` authentication plugin,
`sha256_password` is deprecated; expect it to
be removed in a future version of MySQL. MySQL accounts that
authenticate using `sha256_password` should
be migrated to use `caching_sha2_password`
instead.

Important

To connect to the server using an account that authenticates
with the `sha256_password` plugin, you must
use either a TLS connection or an unencrypted connection that
supports password exchange using an RSA key pair, as described
later in this section. Either way, the
`sha256_password` plugin uses MySQL's
encryption capabilities. See
[Section 8.3, “Using Encrypted Connections”](encrypted-connections.md "8.3 Using Encrypted Connections").

Note

In the name `sha256_password`,
“sha256” refers to the 256-bit digest length the
plugin uses for encryption. In the name
`caching_sha2_password`, “sha2”
refers more generally to the SHA-2 class of encryption
algorithms, of which 256-bit encryption is one instance. The
latter name choice leaves room for future expansion of
possible digest lengths without changing the plugin name.

The following table shows the plugin names on the server and
client sides.

**Table 8.18 Plugin and Library Names for SHA-256 Authentication**

| Plugin or File | Plugin or File Name |
| --- | --- |
| Server-side plugin | `sha256_password` |
| Client-side plugin | `sha256_password` |
| Library file | None (plugins are built in) |

For general information about pluggable authentication in MySQL,
see [Section 8.2.17, “Pluggable Authentication”](pluggable-authentication.md "8.2.17 Pluggable Authentication").

##### Installing SHA-256 Pluggable Authentication

The `sha256_password` plugin exists in server
and client forms:

- The server-side plugin is built into the server, need not
  be loaded explicitly, and cannot be disabled by unloading
  it.
- The client-side plugin is built into the
  `libmysqlclient` client library and is
  available to any program linked against
  `libmysqlclient`.

##### Using SHA-256 Pluggable Authentication

To set up an account that uses the deprecated
`sha256_password` plugin for SHA-256 password
hashing, use the following statement, where
*`password`* is the desired account
password:

```sql
CREATE USER 'sha256user'@'localhost'
IDENTIFIED WITH sha256_password BY 'password';
```

The server assigns the `sha256_password`
plugin to the account and uses it to encrypt the password
using SHA-256, storing those values in the
`plugin` and
`authentication_string` columns of the
`mysql.user` system table.

The preceding instructions do not assume that
`sha256_password` is the default
authentication plugin. If `sha256_password`
is the default authentication plugin, a simpler
[`CREATE USER`](create-user.md "15.7.1.3 CREATE USER Statement") syntax can be used.

To start the server with the default authentication plugin set
to `sha256_password`, put these lines in the
server option file:

```ini
[mysqld]
default_authentication_plugin=sha256_password
```

That causes the `sha256_password` plugin to
be used by default for new accounts. As a result, it is
possible to create the account and set its password without
naming the plugin explicitly:

```sql
CREATE USER 'sha256user'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'password';
```

Another consequence of setting
[`default_authentication_plugin`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_default_authentication_plugin)
to `sha256_password` is that, to use some
other plugin for account creation, you must specify that
plugin explicitly. For example, to use the
`mysql_native_password` plugin, use this
statement:

```sql
CREATE USER 'nativeuser'@'localhost'
IDENTIFIED WITH mysql_native_password BY 'password';
```

`sha256_password` supports connections over
secure transport. `sha256_password` also
supports encrypted password exchange using RSA over
unencrypted connections if MySQL is compiled using OpenSSL,
and the MySQL server to which you wish to connect is
configured to support RSA (using the RSA configuration
procedure given later in this section).

RSA support has these characteristics:

- On the server side, two system variables name the RSA
  private and public key-pair files:
  [`sha256_password_private_key_path`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_sha256_password_private_key_path)
  and
  [`sha256_password_public_key_path`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_sha256_password_public_key_path).
  The database administrator must set these variables at
  server startup if the key files to use have names that
  differ from the system variable default values.
- The server uses the
  [`sha256_password_auto_generate_rsa_keys`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_sha256_password_auto_generate_rsa_keys)
  system variable to determine whether to automatically
  generate the RSA key-pair files. See
  [Section 8.3.3, “Creating SSL and RSA Certificates and Keys”](creating-ssl-rsa-files.md "8.3.3 Creating SSL and RSA Certificates and Keys").
- The [`Rsa_public_key`](server-status-variables.md#statvar_Rsa_public_key)
  status variable displays the RSA public key value used by
  the `sha256_password` authentication
  plugin.
- Clients that are in possession of the RSA public key can
  perform RSA key pair-based password exchange with the
  server during the connection process, as described later.
- For connections by accounts that authenticate with
  `sha256_password` and RSA public key
  pair-based password exchange, the server sends the RSA
  public key to the client as needed. However, if a copy of
  the public key is available on the client host, the client
  can use it to save a round trip in the client/server
  protocol:

  - For these command-line clients, use the
    [`--server-public-key-path`](mysql-command-options.md#option_mysql_server-public-key-path)
    option to specify the RSA public key file:
    [**mysql**](mysql.md "6.5.1 mysql — The MySQL Command-Line Client"),
    [**mysqladmin**](mysqladmin.md "6.5.2 mysqladmin — A MySQL Server Administration Program"),
    [**mysqlbinlog**](mysqlbinlog.md "6.6.9 mysqlbinlog — Utility for Processing Binary Log Files"),
    [**mysqlcheck**](mysqlcheck.md "6.5.3 mysqlcheck — A Table Maintenance Program"),
    [**mysqldump**](mysqldump.md "6.5.4 mysqldump — A Database Backup Program"),
    [**mysqlimport**](mysqlimport.md "6.5.5 mysqlimport — A Data Import Program"),
    [**mysqlpump**](mysqlpump.md "6.5.6 mysqlpump — A Database Backup Program"),
    [**mysqlshow**](mysqlshow.md "6.5.7 mysqlshow — Display Database, Table, and Column Information"),
    [**mysqlslap**](mysqlslap.md "6.5.8 mysqlslap — A Load Emulation Client"),
    **mysqltest**,
    [**mysql\_upgrade**](mysql-upgrade.md "6.4.5 mysql_upgrade — Check and Upgrade MySQL Tables").
  - For programs that use the C API, call
    [`mysql_options()`](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/c-api/8.0/en/mysql-options.html) to
    specify the RSA public key file by passing the
    `MYSQL_SERVER_PUBLIC_KEY` option and
    the name of the file.
  - For replicas, use the [`CHANGE
    REPLICATION SOURCE TO`](change-replication-source-to.md "15.4.2.3 CHANGE REPLICATION SOURCE TO Statement") statement (from MySQL
    8.0.23) or [`CHANGE MASTER
    TO`](change-master-to.md "15.4.2.1 CHANGE MASTER TO Statement") statement (before MySQL 8.0.23) with the
    `SOURCE_PUBLIC_KEY_PATH` |
    `MASTER_PUBLIC_KEY_PATH` option to
    specify the RSA public key file. For Group
    Replication, the
    [`group_replication_recovery_get_public_key`](group-replication-system-variables.md#sysvar_group_replication_recovery_get_public_key)
    system variable serves the same purpose.

For clients that use the `sha256_password`
plugin, passwords are never exposed as cleartext when
connecting to the server. How password transmission occurs
depends on whether a secure connection or RSA encryption is
used:

- If the connection is secure, an RSA key pair is
  unnecessary and is not used. This applies to connections
  encrypted using TLS. The password is sent as cleartext but
  cannot be snooped because the connection is secure.

  Note

  Unlike `caching_sha2_password`, the
  `sha256_password` plugin does not treat
  shared-memory connections as secure, even though
  share-memory transport is secure by default.
- If the connection is not secure, and an RSA key pair is
  available, the connection remains unencrypted. This
  applies to connections not encrypted using TLS. RSA is
  used only for password exchange between client and server,
  to prevent password snooping. When the server receives the
  encrypted password, it decrypts it. A scramble is used in
  the encryption to prevent repeat attacks.
- If a secure connection is not used and RSA encryption is
  not available, the connection attempt fails because the
  password cannot be sent without being exposed as
  cleartext.

Note

To use RSA password encryption with
`sha256_password`, the client and server
both must be compiled using OpenSSL, not just one of them.

Assuming that MySQL has been compiled using OpenSSL, use the
following procedure to enable use of an RSA key pair for
password exchange during the client connection process:

1. Create the RSA private and public key-pair files using the
   instructions in [Section 8.3.3, “Creating SSL and RSA Certificates and Keys”](creating-ssl-rsa-files.md "8.3.3 Creating SSL and RSA Certificates and Keys").
2. If the private and public key files are located in the
   data directory and are named
   `private_key.pem` and
   `public_key.pem` (the default values of
   the
   [`sha256_password_private_key_path`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_sha256_password_private_key_path)
   and
   [`sha256_password_public_key_path`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_sha256_password_public_key_path)
   system variables), the server uses them automatically at
   startup.

   Otherwise, to name the key files explicitly, set the
   system variables to the key file names in the server
   option file. If the files are located in the server data
   directory, you need not specify their full path names:

   ```ini
   [mysqld]
   sha256_password_private_key_path=myprivkey.pem
   sha256_password_public_key_path=mypubkey.pem
   ```

   If the key files are not located in the data directory, or
   to make their locations explicit in the system variable
   values, use full path names:

   ```ini
   [mysqld]
   sha256_password_private_key_path=/usr/local/mysql/myprivkey.pem
   sha256_password_public_key_path=/usr/local/mysql/mypubkey.pem
   ```
3. Restart the server, then connect to it and check the
   [`Rsa_public_key`](server-status-variables.md#statvar_Rsa_public_key) status
   variable value. The value actually displayed differs from
   that shown here, but should be nonempty:

   ```sql
   mysql> SHOW STATUS LIKE 'Rsa_public_key'\G
   *************************** 1. row ***************************
   Variable_name: Rsa_public_key
           Value: -----BEGIN PUBLIC KEY-----
   MIGfMA0GCSqGSIb3DQEBAQUAA4GNADCBiQKBgQDO9nRUDd+KvSZgY7cNBZMNpwX6
   MvE1PbJFXO7u18nJ9lwc99Du/E7lw6CVXw7VKrXPeHbVQUzGyUNkf45Nz/ckaaJa
   aLgJOBCIDmNVnyU54OT/1lcs2xiyfaDMe8fCJ64ZwTnKbY2gkt1IMjUAB5Ogd5kJ
   g8aV7EtKwyhHb0c30QIDAQAB
   -----END PUBLIC KEY-----
   ```

   If the value is empty, the server found some problem with
   the key files. Check the error log for diagnostic
   information.

After the server has been configured with the RSA key files,
accounts that authenticate with the
`sha256_password` plugin have the option of
using those key files to connect to the server. As mentioned
previously, such accounts can use either a secure connection
(in which case RSA is not used) or an unencrypted connection
that performs password exchange using RSA. Suppose that an
unencrypted connection is used. For example:

```terminal
$> mysql --ssl-mode=DISABLED -u sha256user -p
Enter password: password
```

For this connection attempt by `sha256user`,
the server determines that `sha256_password`
is the appropriate authentication plugin and invokes it
(because that was the plugin specified at
[`CREATE USER`](create-user.md "15.7.1.3 CREATE USER Statement") time). The plugin
finds that the connection is not encrypted and thus requires
the password to be transmitted using RSA encryption. In this
case, the plugin sends the RSA public key to the client, which
uses it to encrypt the password and returns the result to the
server. The plugin uses the RSA private key on the server side
to decrypt the password and accepts or rejects the connection
based on whether the password is correct.

The server sends the RSA public key to the client as needed.
However, if the client has a file containing a local copy of
the RSA public key required by the server, it can specify the
file using the
[`--server-public-key-path`](mysql-command-options.md#option_mysql_server-public-key-path) option:

```terminal
$> mysql --ssl-mode=DISABLED -u sha256user -p --server-public-key-path=file_name
Enter password: password
```

The public key value in the file named by the
[`--server-public-key-path`](mysql-command-options.md#option_mysql_server-public-key-path) option
should be the same as the key value in the server-side file
named by the
[`sha256_password_public_key_path`](server-system-variables.md#sysvar_sha256_password_public_key_path)
system variable. If the key file contains a valid public key
value but the value is incorrect, an access-denied error
occurs. If the key file does not contain a valid public key,
the client program cannot use it. In this case, the
`sha256_password` plugin sends the public key
to the client as if no
[`--server-public-key-path`](mysql-command-options.md#option_mysql_server-public-key-path) option
had been specified.

Client users can obtain the RSA public key two ways:

- The database administrator can provide a copy of the
  public key file.
- A client user who can connect to the server some other way
  can use a `SHOW STATUS LIKE
  'Rsa_public_key'` statement and save the returned
  key value in a file.
