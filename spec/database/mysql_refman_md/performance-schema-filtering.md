### 29.4.2 Performance Schema Event Filtering

Events are processed in a producer/consumer fashion:

- Instrumented code is the source for events and produces
  events to be collected. The
  [`setup_instruments`](performance-schema-setup-instruments-table.md "29.12.2.3 The setup_instruments Table") table lists
  the instruments for which events can be collected, whether
  they are enabled, and (for enabled instruments) whether to
  collect timing information:

  ```sql
  mysql> SELECT NAME, ENABLED, TIMED
         FROM performance_schema.setup_instruments;
  +---------------------------------------------------+---------+-------+
  | NAME                                              | ENABLED | TIMED |
  +---------------------------------------------------+---------+-------+
  ...
  | wait/synch/mutex/sql/LOCK_global_read_lock        | YES     | YES   |
  | wait/synch/mutex/sql/LOCK_global_system_variables | YES     | YES   |
  | wait/synch/mutex/sql/LOCK_lock_db                 | YES     | YES   |
  | wait/synch/mutex/sql/LOCK_manager                 | YES     | YES   |
  ...
  ```

  The [`setup_instruments`](performance-schema-setup-instruments-table.md "29.12.2.3 The setup_instruments Table") table
  provides the most basic form of control over event
  production. To further refine event production based on the
  type of object or thread being monitored, other tables may
  be used as described in
  [Section 29.4.3, “Event Pre-Filtering”](performance-schema-pre-filtering.md "29.4.3 Event Pre-Filtering").
- Performance Schema tables are the destinations for events
  and consume events. The
  [`setup_consumers`](performance-schema-setup-consumers-table.md "29.12.2.2 The setup_consumers Table") table lists the
  types of consumers to which event information can be sent
  and whether they are enabled:

  ```sql
  mysql> SELECT * FROM performance_schema.setup_consumers;
  +----------------------------------+---------+
  | NAME                             | ENABLED |
  +----------------------------------+---------+
  | events_stages_current            | NO      |
  | events_stages_history            | NO      |
  | events_stages_history_long       | NO      |
  | events_statements_cpu            | NO      |
  | events_statements_current        | YES     |
  | events_statements_history        | YES     |
  | events_statements_history_long   | NO      |
  | events_transactions_current      | YES     |
  | events_transactions_history      | YES     |
  | events_transactions_history_long | NO      |
  | events_waits_current             | NO      |
  | events_waits_history             | NO      |
  | events_waits_history_long        | NO      |
  | global_instrumentation           | YES     |
  | thread_instrumentation           | YES     |
  | statements_digest                | YES     |
  +----------------------------------+---------+
  ```

Filtering can be done at different stages of performance
monitoring:

- **Pre-filtering.**
  This is done by modifying Performance Schema configuration
  so that only certain types of events are collected from
  producers, and collected events update only certain
  consumers. To do this, enable or disable instruments or
  consumers. Pre-filtering is done by the Performance Schema
  and has a global effect that applies to all users.

  Reasons to use pre-filtering:

  - To reduce overhead. Performance Schema overhead should
    be minimal even with all instruments enabled, but
    perhaps you want to reduce it further. Or you do not
    care about timing events and want to disable the timing
    code to eliminate timing overhead.
  - To avoid filling the current-events or history tables
    with events in which you have no interest. Pre-filtering
    leaves more “room” in these tables for
    instances of rows for enabled instrument types. If you
    enable only file instruments with pre-filtering, no rows
    are collected for nonfile instruments. With
    post-filtering, nonfile events are collected, leaving
    fewer rows for file events.
  - To avoid maintaining some kinds of event tables. If you
    disable a consumer, the server does not spend time
    maintaining destinations for that consumer. For example,
    if you do not care about event histories, you can
    disable the history table consumers to improve
    performance.
- **Post-filtering.**
  This involves the use of `WHERE` clauses
  in queries that select information from Performance Schema
  tables, to specify which of the available events you want
  to see. Post-filtering is performed on a per-user basis
  because individual users select which of the available
  events are of interest.

  Reasons to use post-filtering:

  - To avoid making decisions for individual users about
    which event information is of interest.
  - To use the Performance Schema to investigate a
    performance issue when the restrictions to impose using
    pre-filtering are not known in advance.

The following sections provide more detail about pre-filtering
and provide guidelines for naming instruments or consumers in
filtering operations. For information about writing queries to
retrieve information (post-filtering), see
[Section 29.5, “Performance Schema Queries”](performance-schema-queries.md "29.5 Performance Schema Queries").
