#### 18.2.4.2 Problems from Tables Not Being Closed Properly

Each `MyISAM` index file
(`.MYI` file) has a counter in the header
that can be used to check whether a table has been closed
properly. If you get the following warning from
[`CHECK TABLE`](check-table.md "15.7.3.2 CHECK TABLE Statement") or
[**myisamchk**](myisamchk.md "6.6.4 myisamchk — MyISAM Table-Maintenance Utility"), it means that this counter has
gone out of sync:

```none
clients are using or haven't closed the table properly
```

This warning doesn't necessarily mean that the table is
corrupted, but you should at least check the table.

The counter works as follows:

- The first time a table is updated in MySQL, a counter in the
  header of the index files is incremented.
- The counter is not changed during further updates.
- When the last instance of a table is closed (because a
  [`FLUSH TABLES`](flush.md#flush-tables) operation was
  performed or because there is no room in the table cache),
  the counter is decremented if the table has been updated at
  any point.
- When you repair the table or check the table and it is found
  to be okay, the counter is reset to zero.
- To avoid problems with interaction with other processes that
  might check the table, the counter is not decremented on
  close if it was zero.

In other words, the counter can become incorrect only under
these conditions:

- A `MyISAM` table is copied without first
  issuing [`LOCK TABLES`](lock-tables.md "15.3.6 LOCK TABLES and UNLOCK TABLES Statements") and
  [`FLUSH TABLES`](flush.md#flush-tables).
- MySQL has crashed between an update and the final close.
  (The table may still be okay because MySQL always issues
  writes for everything between each statement.)
- A table was modified by [**myisamchk
  --recover**](myisamchk.md "6.6.4 myisamchk — MyISAM Table-Maintenance Utility") or [**myisamchk
  --update-state**](myisamchk.md "6.6.4 myisamchk — MyISAM Table-Maintenance Utility") at the same time that it was in use
  by [**mysqld**](mysqld.md "6.3.1 mysqld — The MySQL Server").
- Multiple [**mysqld**](mysqld.md "6.3.1 mysqld — The MySQL Server") servers are using the
  table and one server performed a [`REPAIR
  TABLE`](repair-table.md "15.7.3.5 REPAIR TABLE Statement") or [`CHECK
  TABLE`](check-table.md "15.7.3.2 CHECK TABLE Statement") on the table while it was in use by another
  server. In this setup, it is safe to use
  [`CHECK TABLE`](check-table.md "15.7.3.2 CHECK TABLE Statement"), although you
  might get the warning from other servers. However,
  [`REPAIR TABLE`](repair-table.md "15.7.3.5 REPAIR TABLE Statement") should be
  avoided because when one server replaces the data file with
  a new one, this is not known to the other servers.

  In general, it is a bad idea to share a data directory among
  multiple servers. See [Section 7.8, “Running Multiple MySQL Instances on One Machine”](multiple-servers.md "7.8 Running Multiple MySQL Instances on One Machine"),
  for additional discussion.
