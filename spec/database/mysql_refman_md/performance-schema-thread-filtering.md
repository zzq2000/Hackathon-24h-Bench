### 29.4.6 Pre-Filtering by Thread

The [`threads`](performance-schema-threads-table.md "29.12.21.8 The threads Table") table contains a row
for each server thread. Each row contains information about a
thread and indicates whether monitoring is enabled for it. For
the Performance Schema to monitor a thread, these things must be
true:

- The `thread_instrumentation` consumer in
  the [`setup_consumers`](performance-schema-setup-consumers-table.md "29.12.2.2 The setup_consumers Table") table must
  be `YES`.
- The `threads.INSTRUMENTED` column must be
  `YES`.
- Monitoring occurs only for those thread events produced from
  instruments that are enabled in the
  [`setup_instruments`](performance-schema-setup-instruments-table.md "29.12.2.3 The setup_instruments Table") table.

The [`threads`](performance-schema-threads-table.md "29.12.21.8 The threads Table") table also indicates
for each server thread whether to perform historical event
logging. This includes wait, stage, statement, and transaction
events and affects logging to these tables:

```none
events_waits_history
events_waits_history_long
events_stages_history
events_stages_history_long
events_statements_history
events_statements_history_long
events_transactions_history
events_transactions_history_long
```

For historical event logging to occur, these things must be
true:

- The appropriate history-related consumers in the
  [`setup_consumers`](performance-schema-setup-consumers-table.md "29.12.2.2 The setup_consumers Table") table must be
  enabled. For example, wait event logging in the
  [`events_waits_history`](performance-schema-events-waits-history-table.md "29.12.4.2 The events_waits_history Table") and
  [`events_waits_history_long`](performance-schema-events-waits-history-long-table.md "29.12.4.3 The events_waits_history_long Table")
  tables requires the corresponding
  `events_waits_history` and
  `events_waits_history_long` consumers to be
  `YES`.
- The `threads.HISTORY` column must be
  `YES`.
- Logging occurs only for those thread events produced from
  instruments that are enabled in the
  [`setup_instruments`](performance-schema-setup-instruments-table.md "29.12.2.3 The setup_instruments Table") table.

For foreground threads (resulting from client connections), the
initial values of the `INSTRUMENTED` and
`HISTORY` columns in
[`threads`](performance-schema-threads-table.md "29.12.21.8 The threads Table") table rows are determined
by whether the user account associated with a thread matches any
row in the [`setup_actors`](performance-schema-setup-actors-table.md "29.12.2.1 The setup_actors Table") table. The
values come from the `ENABLED` and
`HISTORY` columns of the matching
[`setup_actors`](performance-schema-setup-actors-table.md "29.12.2.1 The setup_actors Table") table row.

For background threads, there is no associated user.
`INSTRUMENTED` and `HISTORY`
are `YES` by default and
[`setup_actors`](performance-schema-setup-actors-table.md "29.12.2.1 The setup_actors Table") is not consulted.

The initial [`setup_actors`](performance-schema-setup-actors-table.md "29.12.2.1 The setup_actors Table") contents
look like this:

```sql
mysql> SELECT * FROM performance_schema.setup_actors;
+------+------+------+---------+---------+
| HOST | USER | ROLE | ENABLED | HISTORY |
+------+------+------+---------+---------+
| %    | %    | %    | YES     | YES     |
+------+------+------+---------+---------+
```

The `HOST` and `USER` columns
should contain a literal host or user name, or
`'%'` to match any name.

The `ENABLED` and `HISTORY`
columns indicate whether to enable instrumentation and
historical event logging for matching threads, subject to the
other conditions described previously.

When the Performance Schema checks for a match for each new
foreground thread in `setup_actors`, it tries
to find more specific matches first, using the
`USER` and `HOST` columns
(`ROLE` is unused):

- Rows with
  `USER='literal'`
  and
  `HOST='literal'`.
- Rows with
  `USER='literal'`
  and `HOST='%'`.
- Rows with `USER='%'` and
  `HOST='literal'`.
- Rows with `USER='%'` and
  `HOST='%'`.

The order in which matching occurs matters because different
matching [`setup_actors`](performance-schema-setup-actors-table.md "29.12.2.1 The setup_actors Table") rows can have
different `USER` and `HOST`
values. This enables instrumenting and historical event logging
to be applied selectively per host, user, or account (user and
host combination), based on the `ENABLED` and
`HISTORY` column values:

- When the best match is a row with
  `ENABLED=YES`, the
  `INSTRUMENTED` value for the thread becomes
  `YES`. When the best match is a row with
  `HISTORY=YES`, the
  `HISTORY` value for the thread becomes
  `YES`.
- When the best match is a row with
  `ENABLED=NO`, the
  `INSTRUMENTED` value for the thread becomes
  `NO`. When the best match is a row with
  `HISTORY=NO`, the
  `HISTORY` value for the thread becomes
  `NO`.
- When no match is found, the `INSTRUMENTED`
  and `HISTORY` values for the thread become
  `NO`.

The `ENABLED` and `HISTORY`
columns in [`setup_actors`](performance-schema-setup-actors-table.md "29.12.2.1 The setup_actors Table") rows can be
set to `YES` or `NO`
independent of one another. This means you can enable
instrumentation separately from whether you collect historical
events.

By default, monitoring and historical event collection are
enabled for all new foreground threads because the
[`setup_actors`](performance-schema-setup-actors-table.md "29.12.2.1 The setup_actors Table") table initially
contains a row with `'%'` for both
`HOST` and `USER`. To perform
more limited matching such as to enable monitoring only for some
foreground threads, you must change this row because it matches
any connection, and add rows for more specific
`HOST`/`USER` combinations.

Suppose that you modify
[`setup_actors`](performance-schema-setup-actors-table.md "29.12.2.1 The setup_actors Table") as follows:

```sql
UPDATE performance_schema.setup_actors
SET ENABLED = 'NO', HISTORY = 'NO'
WHERE HOST = '%' AND USER = '%';
INSERT INTO performance_schema.setup_actors
(HOST,USER,ROLE,ENABLED,HISTORY)
VALUES('localhost','joe','%','YES','YES');
INSERT INTO performance_schema.setup_actors
(HOST,USER,ROLE,ENABLED,HISTORY)
VALUES('hosta.example.com','joe','%','YES','NO');
INSERT INTO performance_schema.setup_actors
(HOST,USER,ROLE,ENABLED,HISTORY)
VALUES('%','sam','%','NO','YES');
```

The [`UPDATE`](update.md "15.2.17 UPDATE Statement") statement changes the
default match to disable instrumentation and historical event
collection. The [`INSERT`](insert.md "15.2.7 INSERT Statement") statements
add rows for more specific matches.

Now the Performance Schema determines how to set the
`INSTRUMENTED` and `HISTORY`
values for new connection threads as follows:

- If `joe` connects from the local host, the
  connection matches the first inserted row. The
  `INSTRUMENTED` and
  `HISTORY` values for the thread become
  `YES`.
- If `joe` connects from
  `hosta.example.com`, the connection matches
  the second inserted row. The `INSTRUMENTED`
  value for the thread becomes `YES` and the
  `HISTORY` value becomes
  `NO`.
- If `joe` connects from any other host,
  there is no match. The `INSTRUMENTED` and
  `HISTORY` values for the thread become
  `NO`.
- If `sam` connects from any host, the
  connection matches the third inserted row. The
  `INSTRUMENTED` value for the thread becomes
  `NO` and the `HISTORY`
  value becomes `YES`.
- For any other connection, the row with
  `HOST` and `USER` set to
  `'%'` matches. This row now has
  `ENABLED` and `HISTORY`
  set to `NO`, so the
  `INSTRUMENTED` and
  `HISTORY` values for the thread become
  `NO`.

Modifications to the [`setup_actors`](performance-schema-setup-actors-table.md "29.12.2.1 The setup_actors Table")
table affect only foreground threads created subsequent to the
modification, not existing threads. To affect existing threads,
modify the `INSTRUMENTED` and
`HISTORY` columns of
[`threads`](performance-schema-threads-table.md "29.12.21.8 The threads Table") table rows.
